Opinion



ORDER
In this employment discrimination case, Matthew Bryson alleges that his employer, CompuCom Systems, fired him, retaliated against him, and failed to accommodate his disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Mr. Bryson has not presented sufficient evidence to create disputed questions of material fact, and CompuCom's motion for summary judgment will be granted. Mr. Bryson's motion for summary judgment will be denied.

I. THE EVIDENCE
Viewed in the light most favorable to Mr. Bryson, the evidence shows the following:
Mr. Bryson worked in a sales role at CompuCom beginning in April 2018. Doc. 112-2 at 3. He performed well and received good evaluations. See, e.g., Doc. 104-2 at 14; Doc. 117-2 at 7-8, 10.
Late in 2018, Mr. Bryson was diagnosed with a hernia. Doc. 121-3 at ¶ 7. Soon thereafter, he told his managers he would need time off for surgery. Doc. 112-2 [*2]  at 13. While awaiting surgery to repair the hernia, he was subject to a ten-pound lifting restriction. Doc. 117-3 at 4. None of his job duties involved lifting. Doc. 112-2 at 8. He worked up until his surgery on April 4, 2019, and after an approved leave of absence, he returned to work on April 8. Doc. 2 at ¶ 23; Doc. 112-2 at 56. He remained subject to the same ten-pound lifting restriction. Doc. 117-3 at 4; Doc. 112-3 at 4-5. No manager or supervisor ever made negative comments about the weight restriction or his need to take time off for surgery. Doc. 112-2 at 41-42.
In the spring of 2019, CompuCom began laying off employees as part of a corporate reorganization. Doc. 110-4 at 6-7. The decision to terminate Mr. Bryson was not made locally or by his supervisor or manager; rather, the decision was made on a national level by the Senior Vice-President of Sales. Doc. 112-4 at 7. As part of this reduction, CompuCom terminated the employment of all sales representatives based outside of Charlotte, Dallas, and Tampa in May 2019, without consideration of individual situations. Id.; Doc. 45-2 at 7.
Mr. Bryson was assigned to the Coastal South Carolina division, Doc. 110-4 at 4, and his employment [*3]  was terminated on May 8, 2019, effective immediately. Doc. 112-2 at 3, 25-26; Doc. 23-4 at 28. He received a phone call from CompuCom executives saying his position was being eliminated, Doc. 112-2 at 24-25; the written notice of termination attributed the termination to the restructuring, Doc. 23-4 at 28; and CompuCom's evidence is that Mr. Bryson was terminated as part of the reduction-in-force. Doc. 45-2 at 7. At the time, Mr. Bryson was performing well and meeting all his employer's expectations. See, e.g., Doc. 104-2 at 14; Doc. 117-2 at 7-8, 10.
Other top performers with similar sales metrics as Mr. Bryson were not terminated. Doc. 112-2 at 43; Doc. 117-2 at 10. These included Pablo Reyna and Kay Moder, see Doc. 112-2 at 43, who worked in the Dallas office and whose employment was terminated in October, Doc. 110-4 at 5, and Matt Stone and Dan Danhower, Doc. 112-2 at 43, who worked in the Charlotte and Tampa divisions respectively and who had tendered their resignations before the RIF action date in May and who left their employment shortly thereafter. Doc. 110-4 at 6. His former manager, Chip Wodarski, took over some of Mr. Bryson's sales responsibilities for a short time1 until [*4]  his employment was also terminated as part of the same reduction-in-force. Doc. 112-4 at 5; Doc. 48-24 at ¶¶ 8, 11.

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Mr. Bryson asserts that CompuCom violated the ADA in three ways: failure to provide reasonable accommodations, wrongful discharge, and retaliation.
To establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that he had a disability within the meaning of the statute; that the employer had notice of his disability; that the plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the position with reasonable accommodation; and that the employer refused to make such accommodations. Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013). Here, Mr. Bryson has not provided any evidence that he requested an accommodation that CompuCom did not provide. He was given leave for his surgery, and to the extent he contends he was not allowed to drive to see a client, the evidence is undisputed that this occurred on the day CompuCom terminated his employment. Summary judgment in favor of CompuCom is thus appropriate on Mr. Bryson's failure to accommodate claim.
In a wrongful discharge case brought under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he has a disability; [*5]  (2) that he was qualified for the employment in question; and (3) his employer terminated his employment because of his disability. Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Off. of the Cts., 780 F.3d 562, 572 (4th Cir. 2015). "Disability discrimination may be proven through direct and indirect evidence or through the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework." Id. Mr. Bryson has not provided any direct evidence that his employment was terminated because of his disability. Nor does the circumstantial evidence support his claim. He has not shown that the decisionmaker was aware of his disability. There is no temporal proximity, as his supervisor knew about Mr. Bryson's weight restriction for over four months before his employment was terminated.
Even if he has made a prima facie case, CompuCom has rebutted it with uncontroverted evidence that Mr. Bryson was terminated because of a reduction-in-force. Mr. Bryson's assertions about comparators are largely based on matters outside his personal knowledge, see Doc. 117-2 at 11, and his evidence does not rise to the level of showing pretext. See Hannah P. v. Coats, 916 F.3d 327, 342 (4th Cir. 2019) (noting that if the defendant-employer provides a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, the plaintiff must show the proffered reason was a pretext for [*6]  discrimination).
Mr. Bryson contends that he was a top performer who did excellent work. While he has presented substantial evidence to that point, that is not enough to prove discrimination. He argues that other top performers were not included in the reduction-in-force, but he has not produced any evidence to rebut CompuCom's evidence that the reduction-in-force was not performance-based, and the four "high-performers" he identified who were not terminated, Doc. 112-2 at 43, were either working in a division not closed as part of the May RIF or had already tendered their resignations. Doc. 110-4 at 5-6. He points out that his job was taken over by his manager, Mr. Wodarski, who did not have a disability, but the evidence is undisputed that any work Mr. Wodarski handled was only temporary while the division was phased out, Doc. 112-4 at 5, and, as previously noted, there is no evidence that the vice-president who decided to terminate his employment knew about his weight restrictions or his surgery. Summary judgment in favor of CompuCom is appropriate on his wrongful discharge claim.
The elements of an ADA retaliation claim are: "(1) [an employee's] engagement in a protected activity; [*7]  (2) adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the employment action." Hamilton v. Prince George's Cnty. Police Dep't, No. DKC 17-2300, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43774, 2018 WL 1365847, at *6 (D. Md. Mar. 16, 2018) (quoting Coleman v. Md. Ct. of Appeals, 626 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir. 2010)). The only potential protected activity here is Mr. Bryson's request for leave related to his hernia surgery. While proximity in time can be sufficient to show a causal connection, see Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., 252 F.3d 696, 706 (4th Cir. 2001), that temporal proximity must be "very close" if, as here, it is the only fact supporting causation. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) (per curiam) (citation omitted); Penley v. McDowell Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 876 F.3d 646, 656 (4th Cir. 2017).
It is undisputed that Mr. Bryson told his manager that he would need to take leave for hernia surgery some four months before he was terminated. See Doc. 117-2 at 14. This is not a "very close" temporal connection and is insufficient on its own to give rise to an inference of causation. Roberts v. Glenn Indus. Grp., Inc., No. 19-1215, 998 F.3d 111, 2021 WL 2021812, at *11 (4th Cir. May 21, 2021) (holding that three months between protected activity and an adverse action does not support finding a causal link without other evidence). This is especially so given the undisputed evidence that the decision to terminate his employment was made by someone else and the absence of any evidence that the decisionmaker knew about his weight restriction.2
Even if Mr. Bryson has established a prima facie case, CompuCom has rebutted it and Mr. Bryson has not established [*8]  pretext. See Coats, 916 F.3d at 342. As noted above, CompuCom has produced uncontradicted evidence that Mr. Bryson was terminated as part of a reduction-in-force, there is no evidence that the decisionmaker knew about Mr. Bryson's hernia surgery, and there are no other facts or circumstances from which a factfinder could infer he was terminated as a result of taking leave for surgery or because he had a temporary weight restriction. Summary judgment in favor of CompuCom is thus appropriate on Mr. Bryson's retaliation claim.

III. MOTION TO SEAL
Mr. Bryson asks the Court to seal certain deposition testimony and records submitted in connection with the summary judgment briefing because they contain personal and medical information. See Doc. 111 at 2; Doc. 116 at 2.3 CompuCom does not oppose the motion to seal some of the medical records from Duke Health involving his surgery. See Doc. 111 at 2-3 (addressing pages 56-73 of Doc. 112-2). But it otherwise contends that the motions to seal should be denied because the medical information in the exhibits is narrowly tailored to disclose only the medical condition at issue in this case. Id.; Doc. 116 at 2.
As Mr. Bryson acknowledges, the public has a First Amendment right of [*9]  access to these documents because they were filed in connection with a motion for summary judgment. Virginia Dept. of State Police v. Washington Post, 386 F.3d 567, 578 (4th Cir. 2004); Rushford v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 846 F.2d 249, 253 (4th Cir. 1988). The First Amendment right of access to judicial records "yields only in the existence of a compelling governmental interest . . . that is narrowly tailored to serve that interest." See In re Application of the U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(D), 707 F.3d 283, 290 (4th Cir. 2013). The party seeking to limit public access bears the burden to show that sealing is appropriate, Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 272 (4th Cir. 2014); Rushford, 846 F.2d at 253, and must provide specific reasons to support its position. Va. Dep't of State Police, 386 F.3d at 575.
The Court will seal the medical records from Duke Health concerning the details of his surgery, found at Doc. 112-2 at 56-73. These records contain personal medical information and details about the surgery irrelevant to the present dispute, and the relevant information is easily located elsewhere on the docket. It is appropriate to redact confidential information in his medical records that is irrelevant to the issues here, such as his unrelated medical history and medical prescriptions. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm'n v. Loflin Fabrication LLC, No. 1:18-CV-813, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119252, 2020 WL 3845020, at *2 (M.D.N.C. July 8, 2020).
Otherwise, Mr. Bryson has not met his burden and the motions to seal will be denied. First, the requests to seal are overbroad; they cover all kinds of information that cannot reasonably be characterized as confidential. For example, he asks the Court to seal pages in his [*10]  deposition which cover the dates of his employment and his job responsibilities at CompuCom. See, e.g., Doc. 112-2 at 3-7. Second, he disclosed on the public record most of the medical information he now characterizes as private, so sealing serves no useful purpose. For example, the publicly filed complaint discloses most of the health information discussed in exhibits at issue—that Mr. Bryson was diagnosed with a hernia in December 2018, that the hernia prevented him from pushing, pulling, or lifting anything over 10 pounds, and that he had surgery in April 2019 to repair the hernia. See Doc. 2 at ¶¶ 19-20, 23. And he himself filed on the public docket pages from his deposition and testimony from his doctor about his medical condition, without seeking to seal these exhibits. Docs. 123-23; 121-1. Finally, the exhibits and records contain "relevant dates of treatment and diagnoses that are relevant to the Court's summary judgment decision, and it is difficult to justify keeping secret the nature of a claimed disability in a case involving alleged disability discrimination." Loflin Fabrication, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119252, 2020 WL 3845020, at *2.
Mr. Bryson contends that the exhibits should be sealed because CompuCom filed "heavily curated excerpts" of his [*11]  testimony and Dr. Rege's testimony "with the intent to take [their] testimony out of context to unfairly prejudice [his] case." Doc. 118 at 1-2; see Doc. 120 at 1. Whether this is so or not, it is irrelevant to the issue of sealing.
The information Mr. Bryson asks the Court to seal "was relevant to the Court's decision," and will be "helpful to the public in understanding the Court's summary judgment decision." Loflin Fabrication, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119252, 2020 WL 3845020 at *2. With the exception of the Duke Health medical records related to the surgery itself, the motions to seal will be denied.
It is ORDERED that
1. The plaintiff's renewed motion for partial summary judgment, Doc. 106, is DENIED.
2. The defendant's motion for summary judgment, Doc. 109, is GRANTED.
3. The motion to seal at Doc. 111 is GRANTED as to pages 56-73 of Doc. 112-2 and is otherwise DENIED.
4. The motion to seal at Doc. 116 is DENIED.
5. The Clerk shall substitute pages of 56-73 of Doc. 112-2 with placeholders and shall refile these pages separately under seal. Thereafter, the Clerk shall unseal the redacted Doc. 112-2 and shall unseal the following documents: Docs. 112, 112-1, 112-3, 112-4, 112-5, 112-6, and Docs. 117, 117-1, 117-2, 117-3, 117-4.
This the 11th day of June, 2021. [*12]
