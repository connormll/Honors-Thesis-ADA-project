CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: [IN CHAMBERS] ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff John McPhedran ("Plaintiff") filed this case against Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Defendant" or "Costco") claiming, among other things, that Costco unlawfully terminated his employment due to his age and disability. Before the Court is Costco's "Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment." ("Motion," Dkt. No. 16.) The Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

BACKGROUND
When Plaintiff lost his job at Costco in April 2013, he was 66 years old and suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. (Compl., Dkt. 1, Ex. 1, ¶ 48.) He worked for Costco as a maintenance assistant for more than six years. (Pl.'s Statement of Genuine Issues ("SGI"), Dkt. No. [*2]  17, at 25:5-21.) Plaintiff spent the last year of his employment on a medical leave of absence due to his arthritis. (Id. at 6:1-3.)
Plaintiff contends that soon after he Costco hired him in 2006, a senior officer—Bruce Greenwood—told a member of the management team to fire him because of his age. (Id. at 39:5-9.) Although he was not fired at that time, Plaintiff asserts that Greenwood continued to wield significant influence over his managers at the time he was terminated in 2013. (Id. at 40:13-21.) Specifically, Greenwood was a longtime friend of Bruce Finn—Plaintiff's supervisor and the one who sent him his separation letter. (Id. at 40:18-21.) Plaintiff also asserts that coworkers regularly remarked on his age, calling him "gramps" and making other disparaging comments. (Id. at 40:6-8.)
From March 2012 to April 2013, Plaintiff took a medical leave of absence because of his rheumatoid arthritis. (Id. at 20:7-11.) He submitted numerous doctor notes supporting his medical leave. (Id.) While the majority of these notes simply say that Plaintiff was under the doctor's care and could not return to work, one note dated September 11, 2012 suggested that Plaintiff could work with restrictions: [*3]  "Optimal reentry to duty would be light duty return with lift less than 10 pounds push, and pull less than 15 pounds, repetitive grasp with forced grip of less than 10 reps per hour to assess tolerance for first 14 days of duty return." (Id. at 43:14-22.) According to Plaintiff, Costco refused to consider any limited duty, so his doctor extended his medical leave. (Id. at 21:2-15, 43:2-5.)
Plaintiff contends that he told Costco on multiple occasions that he could return to work with restrictions, but that Costco demanded that he return only when he had no restrictions. (Id. at 41:10-42:17.) Costco refused to move him to a less demanding position or to discuss any alternative arrangements. (Id.) Without accommodations, Plaintiff could not perform the duties of a maintenance assistant, which include cleaning the facilities and emptying trash. (Id. at 26:12-21.)
In March 2013, Plaintiff provided to Costco a "Patient Summary" from his doctor, which read:
Patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis that is now worsening and progressive. Flares more frequent and severe . . . . Work duties not feasible at this time or unlikely to be able to return to work in the future as disability has reached permanent [*4]  status. Have advised patient to seek alternative options as Costcoduties [sic] are inconsistent with his ability to do given his Rhematod [sic] Arthritis.
(Id. at 2:7-20.) At that time, Plaintiff had exhausted the one year of medical leave allowed under his employment agreement, so Costco "decided it was appropriate to separate [his] employment." (Id. at 8:1-6.) Costco sent Plaintiff a letter ("Separation Letter") stating in part:
Given the circumstances, including the fact that you have exhausted your leave available under Company policy, and your need for additional leave appears to have become indefinite, it is appropriate to separate your employment at this time. I am forwarding a termination/resignation form for you to sign and return by April 23, 3013. Please contact me . . . if you have any questions, concerns or information of which you feel Costco should be aware that might affect our decision. . . . If I do not receive a response from you by April 23, 2013, I will proceed with the termination/resignation process.
(McCoy Decl., Dkt. No. 16-2, at 172.)
Plaintiff signed the resignation/termination form. (SGI at 45:15-22.) Costco says that it then offered Plaintiff the opportunity [*5]  to do a job assessment, but Plaintiff says Costco never attempted to arrange such an assessment. (Id. at 34:1-4.)

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate where the record, read in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, indicates "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, courts believe the nonmovant's evidence and draw all justifiable inferences in the nonmovant's favor. Id. at 269. The burden is initially on the moving party to demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23. If the moving party meets its burden, the nonmoving party must produce enough evidence to rebut the moving party's claim and create a genuine dispute of material fact. Id. If the nonmoving party meets this burden, summary judgment is inappropriate. Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Co., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir. 2000).

PRELIMINARY MATTERS
Costco and Plaintiff submitted declarations and exhibits to support their briefs. Costco submitted several objections to the evidence offered by Plaintiff. Specifically, Costco objects to (1) numerous parts of McPhedran's declaration as hearsay or as contradicting his deposition testimony; and (2) numerous [*6]  parts of Minns's declaration as hearsay, lacking foundation, and lacking personal knowledge.
On motions with voluminous objections, "it is often unnecessary and impractical for a court to methodically scrutinize each objection and give a full analysis of each argument raised." Capitol Records, LLC v. Bluebeat, Inc., 765 F. Supp. 2d 1198, 1200 n.1 (C.D. Cal. 2010). Here, the Court does not rely on most of the evidence objected to, so it is unnecessary to rule on the related objections. To the extent that parts of McPhedran's declaration are relied on in this Order, the relevant objections are overruled. See Burch v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1118, 1122 (E.D. Cal. 2006) (concluding that "the court will [only] proceed with any necessary rulings on defendants' evidentiary objections"). The Court does not find those parts to be hearsay or to fall within the "sham affidavit" rule. See Yeager v. Bowlin, 693 F.3d 1076, 1080-81 (9th Cir. 2012) (applying the sham affidavit rule where there was an "extreme" disparity between the affidavit and deposition testimony).

ANALYSIS
Plaintiff asserts ten claims against Costco: (1) disability discrimination, (2) failure to engage in an interactive process, (3) failure to accommodate, (4) age discrimination, (5) retaliation, (6) wrongful termination in violation of public policy, (7) breach of the implied covenant of "good cause," (8) breach of the implied [*7]  covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (9) violation of California Business and Professions Code § 17200, and (10) intentional infliction of emotional distress. Defendant seeks summary judgment on all claims.

1. Plaintiff's Resignation/Termination
Several of Plaintiff's claims depend on whether he resigned voluntarily or was discharged by Costco. Costco argues that these claims fail as a matter of law because Plaintiff voluntarily resigned when he signed the termination/resignation form. Plaintiff says that although he signed the form, the circumstances amount to a constructive discharge. He says he signed only because Costco gave him no alternative that would allow him to keep his job. Because Costco informed Plaintiff that his employment was being terminated if he didn't resign, the Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Plaintiff was constructively discharged.
"Constructive discharge occurs when the employer's conduct effectively forces an employee to resign. Although the employee may say, 'I quit,' the employment relationship is actually severed by the employer's acts, against the employee's will." Turner v. Anheiser Busch, 7 Cal.4th 1248, 1244 (1994). Here, Costco sent Plaintiff a letter saying, "Given the circumstances, including the fact [*8]  that you have exhausted your leave available under Company policy, and your need for additional leave appears to have become indefinite, it is appropriate to separate your employment at this time. I am forwarding a termination/resignation form for you to sign and return by April 23, 3013." (McCoy Decl., at 172.) A reasonable jury could infer from this letter that Plaintiff did not wish to resign, but was constructively discharged.
Having found a genuine issue of material fact concerning Plaintiff's discharge, the Court does not further address the issue in considering the various claims.

2. FEHA Disability Claims
Plaintiff makes three claims for violations of disability provisions of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"). Cal. Gov't Code § 12940. In his first claim, Plaintiff alleges that Costco violated Section 12940(a) by terminating his employment because of his disability. In his second claim, Plaintiff alleges that Costco violated Section 12940(m) by failing to make reasonable accommodations for his disability. Finally, in his third claim, Plaintiff alleges that Costco violated Section 12940(n) by failing to engage in an interactive process with him to determine reasonable accommodations. Costco seeks summary judgment on all of these [*9]  claims. The Court addresses them in turn.

2.1 Terminating Employment Because of Disability
To prevail on a claim under § 12940(a), Plaintiff must show that (1) he was discharged because of his disability and (2) he could perform the essential elements of the job with or without accommodation. Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group. Inc, 166 Cal.App.4th 952, 962, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (Cal. Ct. App. 2008). There is no apparent dispute that Plaintiff lost his job because of his disability. Rather, Costco argues that there is insufficient evidence that Plaintiff could perform essential elements of the job with or without accommodation.
According to Costco, Plaintiff was terminated because his doctor notified Costco that his disability had reached permanent status and he could not return to work. (Motion, at 9:5-15.) Costco points to the doctor's last note, dated March 22, 2013, which reads: "Work duties not feasible at this time or unlikely to be able to return to work in the future as disability has reached permanent status. Have advised patient to seek alternative options as current Costco duties are inconsistent with his ability to do given his Rheumatoid Arthritis." (McCoy Decl. at 167.)
But, contrary to Costco's argument, the doctor's note appears to leave open the possibility that Plaintiff could work with [*10]  accommodations. It encourages Plaintiff to "seek alternative options," and notes that his "current" duties were inconsistent with his physical condition. The Court cannot find on the basis of this letter alone that Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential elements of his job with reasonable accommodations.
Moreover, Plaintiff presents evidence that he indeed told Costco on several occasions that he could return to work with certain limitations. For instance, he states that he made various face-to-face requests to his supervisor for accommodations, but that his supervisor told him he couldn't come back unless he was fully cleared for his old responsibilities. He further points to two notes from his doctor that listed his work restrictions. Costco disputes that there were any ongoing requests for accommodations, but these disputes only reinforce that there are issues of fact to be resolved at trial.
Costco next argues that summary judgment is appropriate because Plaintiff "has not met his burden of establishing there were other available jobs that he was qualified for and able to perform." (Motion, at 17:6-8.) But Plaintiff says in his declaration that he could possibly have performed [*11]  several such jobs, including working the front door or working in membership services. (SGI at 41:1-5.). Costco asserts that Plaintiff was unqualified for those positions because he lacked customer service and cash register experience (Motion at 17:8-25.) Plaintiff responds that Costco could have trained him on those tasks. (Opposition at 18:6-10.) Whether such training is a reasonable accommodation is a matter for the jury. See, e.g., Humphrey v. Memorial Hosp. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1136 (9th Cir. 2001) (reasonableness of a work-from-home arrangement was a triable issue of fact).
The Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED as to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim.

1.2 Failure to Engage in Interactive Process
Under FEHA, employers must engage in a "timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). Costco argues that it was not required to engage in the interactive process because (1) there were no reasonable accommodations available and (2) Plaintiff's doctor never released him to work with restrictions. As noted, genuine issues remain concerning whether reasonable accommodations were available and whether Plaintiff notified [*12]  Costco of his ability to work with restrictions. Thus, summary judgment on these grounds is inappropriate.
On the merits of the claim, Plaintiff has produced sufficient evidence that Costco failed to engage in an interactive process. Costco admits to terminating Plaintiff on the basis of his last doctor's note, which, as stated, is ambiguous enough to create a jury question. Furthermore, there is little evidence suggesting that Costco explored any possible accommodations before terminating Plaintiff even though it had a duty to do so. C.f. Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1137 (holding that the employer had an affirmative duty under the ADA to explore accommodations before terminating the employee).
Costco says that its separation letter gave Plaintiff the option of submitting additional information "showing he could return to work" (Motion at 21:8-10), but the letter was hardly so clear. Although it invited further information, it said nothing of the possibility of returning to work. Not only that, but other statements in the letter made it appear that returning to work was no longer a possibility. For instance, the letter said, "[I]t is appropriate to separate your employment at this time." The Court is not persuaded [*13]  that this fulfilled the requirements of § 12940(n) as a matter of law.
Summary judgment is DENIED as to the Failure to Engage in Interactive Process claim.

1.3 Failure to Make Reasonable Accommodations
Employers have an affirmative duty under § 12940(m) to make reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. Sargent v. Litton Systems, Inc., 841 F.Supp. 956, 962 (N.D. Cal. 1994). Reasonable accommodations may include job restructuring, modified work schedules, reassignment, assistance, and additional training. Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p). Here, Plaintiff has presented evidence that he could work with certain restrictions and that he sought accommodations from Costco. Costco argues that no accommodations were available to Plaintiff because he either could not perform the essential duties of other jobs or he lacked the necessary experience. As noted, the Court finds that these are triable issues of fact.
The Motion is DENIED as to the reasonable accommodations claim.

2. Age Discrimination under FEHA
An age discrimination claim under FEHA generally comprises the following elements: (1) Plaintiff is part of a protected class; (2) Plaintiff was performing competently in his job; (3) there was an adverse employment action; and (4) Defendant had a discriminatory motive. Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). Costco argues that summary [*14]  judgment is appropriate on this claim because Plaintiff produced insufficient evidence of a discriminatory motive.
As noted, Costco argues that Plaintiff was terminated because he used his full year of medical leave and his return to work was indefinite. Plaintiff alleges in this claim that he was really terminated because of his age. In support of the claim, he points to evidence that coworkers and supervisors made various remarks about his age during his employment. (Opposition, at 11:6-19.) Because these statements are remote in time and their connection to the events of this case are tenuous at best, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning any discriminatory animus based on Plaintiff's age.
Plaintiff submits two declarations (from Plaintiff and his former supervisor, Patrick Minns) accusing a Costco executive of ordering supervisors in 2006 to terminate Plaintiff because of his age. Even though this purported order was disobeyed in 2006, Plaintiff asserts that this executive continued to wield power over managers in 2013, leading to a "corporate culture of discrimination." (Opposition at 11:17-12:2.) There is no meaningful evidence of such a culture. [*15]  Even setting aside doubts about the admissibility and reliability of Plaintiff's new declarations, the Court finds that the evidence fails to create any genuine issue concerning age discrimination in this case. Plaintiff fails to identify any recent evidence of management's supposed discriminatory intent, nor any evidence connecting the 2006 events to the decision-makers in this case. Failing that, Plaintiff's evidence of the 2006 events and a few off-the-cuff statements of coworkers—admittedly "done in camaraderie"—are insufficient to show age discrimination in his 2013 termination.
Because there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning Costco's discriminatory motive based on age, summary judgment is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's age discrimination claim.

3. Retaliation
Costco argues that the Court should grant summary judgment on Plaintiff's retaliation claim because Plaintiff fails to show that he participated in a protected activity. The Court agrees. FEHA provides that employers cannot discharge employees for opposing conduct forbidden under FEHA or participating in FEHA proceedings against the employer. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). Plaintiff argues that Costco discharged him because he "continually opposed [*16]  Costco's improper practice of failing to provide an accommodation and its refusal to engage in the interactive process." (Opposition at 21:17-20.) But a "mere request—or even repeated requests—for an accommodation, without more, [does not] constitute a protected activity sufficient to support a claim for retaliation in violation of FEHA." Roper v. Auto-Chlor Sys. of Wash., Inc., 220 Cal. App. 4th 635, 652 (Cal. Ct. App. 2013). Plaintiff's evidence is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact on this issue.
The Motion is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

6. Wrongful Termination
To establish a wrongful termination claim, Plaintiff must show that (1) an employer—employee relationship existed, (2) Defendant terminated his employment, and (3) the termination violated public policy. Holmes v. General Dynamics Corp., 17 Cal. App. 4th 1418, 1426, 22 Cal. Rptr. 2d 172 (Cal. Ct. App. 1993). Here, because the alleged public policy violation concerns disability legislation, the parties' arguments largely overlap with the FEHA arguments. Costco argues that (1) it didn't terminate Plaintiff's employment and (2) it complied with FEHA. As noted, there are genuine issues of material fact concerning whether Costco's separation letter amounted to a constructive discharge and whether Costco violated FEHA's requirements. Therefore, summary judgment on this claim is DENIED. [*17] 

7. Breach of Implied Covenant of "Good Cause"
Costco argues that the Court should grant summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for breach of the implied covenant of good cause because the covenant of good cause is an express provision of Plaintiff's employment contract, not an implied provision. Costco argues that Plaintiff cannot pursue an implied contract claim for breach of an express provision. Even though Plaintiff did not address this argument in his Opposition, the Court declines to grant summary judgment on the mere basis that what should have been called "express" was called "implied." See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 135 S. Ct. 346, 190 L. Ed. 2d 309, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 7437, 2014 WL 5798626 (U.S. Nov. 10, 2014) ("Federal pleading rules . . . do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted"). Costco has sufficient notice of Plaintiff's contract claim and fails to argue any other grounds for summary judgment on the claim. Thus the Motion is DENIED as to this claim.

8. Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
Costco argues that the Court should grant summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because under California law "there is no tort for bad faith breach [*18]  of an employment contract." Guz v. Bechtel, 24 Cal.4th 317, 349, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). There is no opposition to Costco's assertion that the claim should fail because there is no tort remedy. The Court finds Costco's argument persuasive.
The Motion is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

9. Unfair Business Practices
Costco argues that Plaintiff's § 17200 claim is necessarily based on Plaintiff's other claims, and because these claims fail Plaintiff's § 17200 claim must also fail. (Motion at 24:24-25:3.) On the contrary, because Plaintiff's FEHA disability claims survive the Motion, Plaintiff's 17200 claim also survives.
The Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's claim for violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200.

10. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Costco argues that Plaintiff's IIED claim fails as a matter of law because the claim is preempted by the Workers' Compensation Act, and because Costco's conduct was not outrageous. The Court disagrees that the claim is preempted, but agrees that Costco's conduct was not outrageous.

10.1 Workers' Compensation Act
The provisions of the Workers' Compensation act do not bar an IIED claim when an "injury is a result of conduct, whether in the form of discharge or otherwise, not [*19]  seen as reasonably coming within the compensation bargain." Kovatch v. California Casualty Management Co., 65 Cal. App. 4th 1256, 1277, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 217 (1998) overruled on other grounds by Aguilar v. Atl. Ritchfield Co., 25 Cal. 4th 826, 854 (2001). Here, Plaintiff's IIED claims are based on the same conduct as his surviving claims for wrongful termination and disability discrimination. Because, like those claims, the IIED claim is based on alleged violations of anti-discrimination public policy, the Workers' Compensation Act does not bar the claim. See Gantt v. Sentry Insurance, 1 Cal. 4th 1083, 1101, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 874, 824 P.2d 680 (1992) overruled on other grounds by Green v. Ralee Engineering Co., 19 Cal. 4th 66, 79-80, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (1998) ("Just as the individual employment agreement may not include terms which violate fundamental public policy . . ., so the more general 'compensation bargain' cannot encompass conduct, such as sexual or racial discrimination"); City of Moorpark v. Superior Court, 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752 (1998) (holding that the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act did not bar a wrongful termination claim based on discrimination); Accardi v. Superior Court, 17 Cal. App. 4th 341, 352, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 292 (1993) (holding that "a claim for emotional and psychological damage, arising out of employment, is not barred where the distress is engendered by an employer's illegal discriminatory practices."). Therefore, summary judgment on this basis is inappropriate.

10.2 Outrageous Conduct
To prevail on an IIED claim, Plaintiff must show that Costco's conduct was "so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated [*20]  in a civilized society." Bogard v. Employers Cas. Co., 164 Cal.App.3d 602, 616, 210 Cal. Rptr. 578 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985). Plaintiff's evidence—focused on personnel management decisions—does not show such extreme conduct. See, e.g., Janken v. G.M. Hughes Elec., 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 80, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996) ("If personnel management decisions are improperly motivated, the remedy is a suit against the employer for discrimination.")
The Motion is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's IIED claim.

11. Punitive Damages
Costco argues that Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages fails because he presents insufficient evidence that Costco acted with fraud, malice, or oppression. The Court agrees. To establish malice or oppression, Plaintiff must show either despicable conduct carried on with a conscious disregard for Plaintiff's rights, or intent to harm. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(c). Discriminatory conduct alone does not warrant punitive damages. Here, while there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Costco violated FEHA, Plaintiff fails to show that Costco's conduct amounted to fraud, malice, or oppression. C.f. Ngo v. Reno Hilton Resort Corp., 140 F.3d 1299, 1304 (9th Cir. 1998) ("An award of punitive damages under Title VII is proper where the acts of discrimination . . . are willful and egregious, or display reckless indifference to the plaintiff's [rights]."). Plaintiff doesn't argue otherwise in its Opposition. Accordingly, Costco's Motion is [*21]  GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages.

DISPOSITION
Costco's Motion is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claims for age discrimination, retaliation, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and punitive damages. The Motion is DENIED as to the remaining claims.
