ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (Doc. 58)
Before the Court is Defendant VCA, Inc.'s ("VCA's") Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication. (Mot., Doc. 58; Mem., Doc. 58-1.) Plaintiff Damian Raffele opposed, and VCA replied. (Opp'n, Doc. 60; Reply, Doc. 61.) The Court held a hearing on the Motion on June 12, 2020. Having considered the parties' papers and oral argument, and for the reasons [*2]  set forth below, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the Motion.

I. BACKGROUND1
In June 2013, VCA hired Plaintiff as Director of Wellness Plans at the West Los Angeles Office, in which position Plaintiff "was responsible for overseeing VCA's wellness programs throughout the United States." (VCA's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, Doc. 58-2 [hereinafter UCF] ¶¶ 1-2.) In 2015, during his employment with VCA, Plaintiff became ill. (Id. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff was eventually diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome ("GBS"). (Id. ¶ 12; Raffele Decl., Ex. B ISO Opp'n, Doc. 60-1 ¶ 6.)
Plaintiff first went on medical leave on April 28, 2015. (UCF ¶ 3; Druse Decl. ISO Mot., Doc. 58-5 ¶ 4.) On May 11, 2015, VCA sent a letter to Plaintiff to inform him of his potential eligibility for job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (the "FMLA") and the California Family Rights Act (the "CFRA"). (Ex. 8 ISO Mot., Doc. 58-15.) To determine Plaintiff's eligibility, VCA instructed him to complete a "medical certification statement within 15 days." (Id. (formatting removed).) Plaintiff did not timely respond. (UCF ¶ 4.) Accordingly, on June 1, 2015, VCA sent [*3]  a follow-up letter to Plaintiff, reiterating that "approval of [his] [FMLA-and CFRA-protected] leave of absence [wa]s contingent upon the receipt of medical certification." (Id. ¶ 5; Ex. 9 ISO Mot., Doc. 58-16.) On June 4, 2015, Plaintiff responded with a medical certification in which the signing physician described Plaintiff as "temporarily totally disabled" as a result of a "serious medical condition" and therefore unable to work through July 31, 2015. (Ex. 10 ISO Mot., Doc. 58-17 at 2.) The physician identified August 1, 2015 as Plaintiff's "return to work date." (Id.) VCA responded the same day, informing Plaintiff that he had twelve weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave through July 21, 2015 and then extended time off through July 31, 2015, at which time he would need to provide VCA with an updated medical certification. (Ex. 11 to Mot., Doc. 58-18.) At the end of that time period, Plaintiff provided VCA with a medical certification from a different physician who "placed [Plaintiff] off work from 8/1/2015 through 10/30/2015" but otherwise provided no information on Plaintiff's condition. (See Ex. 12 to Mot., Doc. 58-19.) In sum, this period of leave lasted from April 28, 2015 [*4]  through October 31, 2015. (Raffele Decl. ¶ 6.)
After receiving Plaintiff's then-most-recent medical certification, VCA followed up twice to ask Plaintiff to produce additional information to support his request for extended leave, but both requests went unanswered. (See Druse Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.) Then, on October 30, 2015, Plaintiff provided VCA with a medical certification from a third physician. (Ex. 15 to Mot., Doc. 58-22.) This certification contained the GBS diagnosis and a prescription of work restrictions from November 2, 2015 through March 2, 2016. (See id. at 10560.) Specifically, the treating neurologist indicated that he and Plaintiff thought it "adequate [for Plaintiff] to return to an [sic] 6-8 hours schedule while working at home." (Id.) VCA "allow[ed] Plaintiff to return to modified duty on November 2, 2015, performing certain responsibilities remotely." (UCF ¶ 13.) On April 15, 2016, after failing to respond to two requests by VCA for an update on his status, Plaintiff provided VCA with an updated medical certification (from a different treating neurologist) which released him "to return to work with no limitations." (See id. ¶¶ 14-15; Ex. 18 to Mot., Doc. 58-25 at VCA-RAFF000318.) Despite [*5]  the release, "VCA continued to accommodate Plaintiff's remote work schedule for a limited time on the understanding he would return to work in the office once fully recovered." (UCF ¶ 17.) In sum, Plaintiff returned from leave on November 1, 2015 but did not go back to the office, instead returning to work on a remote basis. (See Raffele Decl. ¶ 6.) Between November 1, 2015 and May 16, 2016, Plaintiff "occasionally but rarely made it to the office." (Id. ¶ 12.)
In late May, 2016, Plaintiff inquired about continuing to telework as he intended to relocate to Nevada. (Raffele Dep. Vol. II, Ex. 2 to Mot., Doc. 58-9 [hereinafter Raffele Dep.] at 111:1-19; Raffele Decl. ¶ 16.) The parties dispute whether Plaintiff's supervisor, Aaron Frazier, granted him permission for the move and, relatedly, whether Plaintiff had indicated to Frazier that the move would be temporary or permanent. (See Resp. to UCF, Doc. 60-3 ¶¶ 18, 22.) Plaintiff then moved to Nevada in July 2016. (UCF ¶ 19.) On July 15, 2016, Frazier advised Plaintiff in an email that his position was "not a remote position" and asked Plaintiff to send information on "any continued restrictions or accommodations that [his] health care [*6]  professional recommends" so that Frazier and Plaintiff could "explore all avenues to reasonably accommodate." (Ex. 20 to Mot., Doc. 58-27.) In response, Plaintiff suggested that Frazier had misunderstood Plaintiff's May 2016 "request for continuation of the reasonable accommodation [VCA] made for [Plaintiff] to work remotely due to [his] disability" and asked "that VCA continue to extend this accommodation . . . until [he could] return to work in the office." (Ex. 21 to Mot., Doc. 58-28 at 1.) Plaintiff identifies July 15, 2016 as the date on which VCA stopped accommodating him; he "ha[s] not been permitted to work since July 2016 and ha[s] not been paid since September 2016." (Raffele Decl. ¶¶ 12, 38, 45.)
On July 22, 2016, Plaintiff was evaluated by his neurologist after reporting to her that "his symptoms ha[d] progressed." (Exs. 22-23 to Mot., Docs. 58-29-30.) In a note dated the same day, which Plaintiff provided to VCA on July 24, 2016, his neurologist asked that Plaintiff be "allow[ed] accommodation until [certain] test results become available, for his limited work performance, if present, due to his medical condition." (Ex. 23 to Mot.) On August 23, 2016, VCA placed Plaintiff [*7]  "on an extended leave of absence as a result of [his] medical condition, while [VCA] determine[d] whether [he was] able to return to work with or without reasonable accommodations to perform [his] essential job duties." (Ex. 27 to Mot., Doc. 58-34 at 10637.)
Shortly thereafter, on September 8, 2016, Plaintiff provided to VCA a medical certification signed by Dr. Matthew Carlson, who offered a more generalized diagnosis ("polyneuropathy & polyarthralgia") and described the duration of work limitations (i.e., teleworking) as "indefinite." (Ex. 29 to Mot., Doc. 58-36.) In a September 16, 2016 letter from the Vice President of Human Resources, VCA informed Plaintiff that, dissatisfied with the level of detail in the medical certifications Plaintiff had provided from Dr. Carlson, VCA decided to ask Plaintiff to be examined by a physician of its choice. (See Ex. 30 to Mot., Doc. 58-37.) Plaintiff refused, although the parties dispute VCA's legal authority to seek its own medical examination under the circumstances. (See UCF ¶ 46; Ex. 1 to Raffele Decl. at 10087-90.)
VCA continued to pay Plaintiff through September 11, 2016 and his benefits continued through December 31, 2017. (UCF ¶¶ 36, 47; [*8]  see also Raffele Decl. ¶ 33.) On September 7, 2018, given Plaintiff's "absence from work for over two years," Frazier emailed Plaintiff to let him know that VCA would send him his personal belongings from the Los Angeles office. (UCF ¶ 50.) Plaintiff responded on September 12, 2018, informing Frazier that he had moved back to Southern California (a move which took place in January 2018) and requesting to return to work from leave "with the accommodation of telecommuting." (Id. ¶¶ 49-50; Ex. 35 to Mot., Doc. 58-42.) Plaintiff also indicated that he "would be able to come into the office occasionally for important face-to-face meetings that can't be done via video or phone conference" but that the parties would "need to discuss the frequency and parameters involved." (Ex. 35 to Mot.) Finally, Plaintiff informed Frazier that he would consider a move by VCA "to ship [his] personal belongings to [him] without making arrangements for [him] to return to work with the accommodation of telecommuting" as termination of his employment. (Id.) VCA responded on September 24, 2018, reiterating its request that Plaintiff submit to a medical examination by a VCA-selected physician and advising that [*9]  VCA would interpret Plaintiff's refusal to do so as indication that he has opted to "abandon[]" his employment. (Ex. 36 to Mot., Doc. 58-43.) Plaintiff did not respond. (UCF ¶ 53.) Instead, Plaintiff instituted the instant action.
Plaintiff's complaint contains three claims: (1) an unspecified violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (2) violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"); and (3) wrongful termination in violation of public policy. (Compl., Doc. 1 ¶¶ 20-45.) Although Plaintiff titles his FEHA claim as one for "disability discrimination," he commingles elements from a disability discrimination claim under FEHA and a failure to accommodate claim under FEHA. The parties' briefs are similarly muddled but ultimately speak mostly in terms of failure to accommodate, and Plaintiff confirmed at the hearing on the Motion that he intended to plead a failure to accommodate claim. The Court therefore treats Plaintiff's FEHA claim as one for failure to accommodate.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is proper "if the [moving party] shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the [moving party] is entitled to judgment as a matter [*10]  of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, "[t]he role of the court is not to resolve disputed issues of fact but to assess whether there are any factual issues to be tried." Myers v. Allstate Indem. Co., 109 F. Supp. 3d 1331, 1335 (C.D. Cal. 2015). In so doing, courts must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all justifiable inferences in that party's favor. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
A factual dispute is "genuine" where "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party[,]" and a fact is "material" if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Id. at 248. "[A] mere 'scintilla' of evidence will not be sufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment; rather, the nonmoving party must introduce some 'significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.'" Summers v. Teichert & Son, Inc., 127 F.3d 1150, 1152 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 249).

III. DISCUSSION
VCA moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's FEHA, ADA, and violation of public policy claims, and on Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages.2 (Mot. at 2-3.) The Court addresses each in turn.

A. Failure to Accommodate under FEHA
Under FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer "to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant [*11]  or employee." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m). To establish a failure to accommodate claim, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by the FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual (i.e., he or she can perform the essential functions of the position); and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Cuiellette v. City of Los Angeles, 194 Cal. App. 4th 757, 766, 123 Cal. Rptr. 3d 562 (2011); see also Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 963, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (explaining that the second element of the claim is met where the employee "could perform the essential functions of the relevant job with or without accommodation"). In turn, "[a] reasonable accommodation is 'a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired.'" Aparicio v. Comcast, Inc., 274 F. Supp. 3d 1014, 1029 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (quoting Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 974).
Here, the parties do not dispute that Plaintiff is disabled.
[But] assuming the employee is disabled, the employer cannot prevail on summary judgment on a claim of failure to reasonably accommodate unless it establishes through undisputed facts that (1) reasonable accommodation was offered and refused; (2) there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with [*12]  or without accommodation; or (3) the employer did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith.
Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). Put differently, if the employer does not establish any of the above through undisputed facts, summary judgment must be denied. Because whether an employee is "qualified" and whether an accommodation is "reasonable" turn on the essential functions of the employee's position, each of the three enumerated routes to prevailing on summary judgment requires a settled understanding of those functions. Therefore, VCA's ability to prevail here depends on whether or not the essential functions of the job at issue are in dispute. They are.
VCA contends that Plaintiff's role "required him to supervise other staff members, attend in-office meetings, travel, [] provide presentations[,] . . . [and] network with third-party vendors," responsibilities which Plaintiff could not perform "effectively and/or at all on a remote basis." (Mem. at 11.) By contrast, Plaintiff argues that he could perform all essential responsibilities of his role from home, because he could conduct any [*13]  meetings that would otherwise be in-person "by videoconference, Skype, or FaceTime." (See Opp'n at 8.)
"'Essential functions' means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires" and "does not include the marginal functions of the position." Lui v. City and Cty. of San Francisco, 211 Cal. App. 4th 962, 971, 150 Cal. Rptr. 3d 385 (2012). "The identification of essential job functions is a highly fact-specific inquiry." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 12926(f)(1) of the FEHA provides a non-exhaustive list of reasons why a function might be considered essential: (A) "because the reason the position exists is to perform that function"; (B) "because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed"; and (C) "[t]he function may be highly specialized, so that the incumbent in the position is hired based on expertise or the ability to perform a particular function." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(1). In terms of evidence, section 12926(f)(2) provides:
Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to, the following:
(A) The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential.
(B) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job.
(C) The amount [*14]  of time spent on the job performing the function.
(D) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function.
(E) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement.
(F) The work experiences of past incumbents in the job.
(G) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
Id. § 12926(f)(2).
"Although the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of persuading the fact finder that he can perform the job's essential functions . . . an employer who disputes the plaintiff's claim that he can perform the essential functions must put forth evidence establishing those functions." Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 991 (9th Cir. 2007)3 (internal quotation marks omitted). "The genesis of this rule is the recognition that much of the information which determines those essential functions lies uniquely with the employer." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). "Thus, to the extent that an employer challenges [a FEHA] plaintiff's claim that he can perform the job's essential functions, we think it appropriate to place a burden of production on the employer to come forward with evidence of those essential functions." Id.
As evidence of the essential functions of Plaintiff's role, VCA relies on the job description it provided Plaintiff for Dr. Carlson's [*15]  review, Frazier's deposition testimony, Plaintiff's deposition testimony, and five of Plaintiff's expense reports from 2014-2015. (See UCF ¶¶ 31-34, 38.) Although VCA did not submit the job description itself, the description apparently contains the following responsibilities: "travel 50% of the time, provide direct oversight and management of team, and collaboratively work cross-functionally with other leaders at VCA's Corporate Support Office in Los Angeles." (Id. ¶ 32.) Crucially, however, VCA prepared the job description during the interactive process—i.e., not before "advertising or interviewing applicants for the job." (Frazier Dep., Ex. C to Opp'n, Doc. 60-2 [hereinafter Frazier Dep. ISO Opp'n] at 36:14-37:22, 39:25-40:2; Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(2)(B).) VCA's description of Plaintiff's job is therefore far from dispositive, especially considering that (1) Plaintiff disputes that the description accurately captures the essential functions of his role, and (2) Plaintiff was the first to hold the Director of Wellness Plans role at VCA, meaning that evidence of the work experiences of past incumbents is unavailable (see Frazier Dep. ISO Opp'n at 22:19-21).
Although Frazier's testimony aligns with the job description [*16]  VCA prepared during the interactive process, his testimony, like the job description, was provided post-hoc. Additionally, about half of Frazier's testimony consists of his account of ways in which Plaintiff fell short of his expected performance in his role while he was working remotely (see Frazier Dep., Ex. 37 to Mot., Doc. 58-44 at 53:4-57:10), which, again, is not dispositive, given that Frazier gave his testimony after the fact. Indeed, VCA allowed Plaintiff to work remotely from November 2015 through mid-July 2016 (Raffele Decl. ¶ 12) and offers no contemporaneous evidence of any issues it had with Plaintiff's performance of his duties during that time. At the hearing, VCA maintained that no such evidence exists because Frazier had taken over Plaintiff's essential duties while Plaintiff was teleworking, but, again, VCA was unable to point to any contemporaneous evidence showing that was the case either.
As to Plaintiff's deposition, VCA points the Court to excerpts from the testimony in which Plaintiff confirms that before he began suffering from his medical condition, he performed certain functions in his role that VCA claims are essential. (See, e.g., Raffele Dep. at 60:21-61:16, [*17]  62:21-63:17, 72:3-15, 74:2-25.) Yet, that Plaintiff performed certain functions before he fell ill does not necessarily mean those functions were essential to the position. See Wright v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 609 F. App'x 918, 920 (9th Cir. 2015); Rohr v. Salt River Project Agric. Imp. & Power Dist., 555 F.3d 850, 864 (9th Cir. 2009) ("[A]n employer may not turn every condition of employment which it elects to adopt into a job function, let alone an essential job function, merely by including it in a job description."). Similarly, the expense reports from 2014-2015 show that Plaintiff did travel at various points as part of his role, but they do not show that travel was essential to the role. Nor, for that matter, do the expense reports permit an inference as to how frequently Plaintiff was traveling, or what proportion of his time in the role he spent traveling. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(2)(C); see also Wright, 609 F. App'x at 920 ("UPS's essential functions document was silent as to how often lifting in excess of 40 pounds unassisted was required, and UPS presented no other evidence showing how much time was actually spent performing this task."). Indeed, Plaintiff testified at his deposition that "there was no specific requirement to travel after the national rollout [of the wellness program]." (Raffele Dep. at 66:13-14.)
In sum, VCA has not met its burden of establishing the essential [*18]  functions of Plaintiff's position. Rather, those essential functions are in dispute. Summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim under FEHA is therefore improper.

B. Reasonable Accommodation Under the ADA and Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
Like the FEHA, the ADA "limit[s] [its] protective scope to those employees with a disability who can perform the essential duties of the employment position with reasonable accommodation." Green, 42 Cal. 4th at 2644 ; see also Maharaj v. California Bank & Tr., 909 F. Supp. 2d 1198, 1203 (E.D. Cal. 2012) ("An individual is 'qualified' under both the ADA and the FEHA if he or she is able to perform the essential functions of the employment position that he or she holds or desires with or without reasonable accommodation."). Therefore, VCA's failure to carry its burden as to the essential functions of Plaintiff's role compels the same result—denial of summary judgment—on Plaintiff's ADA claim.
For his wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim, Plaintiff relies on the interests protected by FEHA. (See Compl. ¶¶ 39-41; see also Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 1256, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994) ("In order to sustain a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of fundamental public policy, [a plaintiff] must prove that his dismissal violated a policy that is (1) fundamental, [*19]  (2) beneficial for the public, and (3) embodied in a statute or constitutional provision." (footnotes omitted)).) Because the Court denies summary judgment on Plaintiff's FEHA claim, it likewise denies it on Plaintiff's wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim. See Love v. Motion Indus., Inc., 309 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1135 (N.D. Cal. 2004) ("For his public policy claim, Plaintiff relies solely on the interests protected by Section 1102.5(b). For the reasons discussed above, Plaintiff's Section 1102.5(b) retaliation claim fails as a matter of law. Therefore, Plaintiff's public policy claim has no basis in any statutory violation and necessarily fails as well.")

C. Punitive Damages
Finally, VCA argues that the Court should grant summary judgment on Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. (Mem. at 20.) A claim for punitive damages requires "clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a). "This higher clear and convincing evidentiary standard applies at every stage of the litigation process, including summary adjudication." Adams v. Allstate Ins. Co., 187 F. Supp. 2d 1219, 1231 (C.D. Cal. 2002). And a corporate employer may not be liable for punitive damages "unless the employer . . . authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, [*20]  fraud, or malice." Id. § 3294(b). "[T]he advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation." Id.
VCA argues that "Plaintiff does not possess any, much less 'clear and convincing,' evidence of any action by any VCA employee or agent involving 'oppression, fraud, or malice.'" (Mem. at 20.) Plaintiff counters, somewhat unresponsively, that "[b]ecause there are issues of fact regarding whether defendant engaged in an interactive process to accommodate Plaintiff's disability, punitive damages are appropriate" and that "the evidence is clear that the decision to stop accommodating Plaintiff with his telecommute accommodation came from the CEO of VCA, the COO of VCA, and the president of the largest division of the company, as well as Plaintiff's supervisor Frazier." (Opp'n at 18.)
Plaintiff bases his first argument on Lee v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan of the Nw., No. 3:16-CV-01991-YY, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108183, 2018 WL 4523142 (D. Or. Apr. 9, 2018), report and recommendation adopted in part, rejected in part, No. 3:16-CV-1991-YY, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103197, 2018 WL 3090195 (D. Or. June 20, 2018), in which the court explained that "[u]nder 42 USC § 1981a(a)(3), a plaintiff is not entitled to compensatory or punitive [*21]  damages under the ADA when the employer 'demonstrates good faith efforts . . . to identify and make a reasonable accommodation that would provide [the employee] with an equally effective opportunity and would not cause an undue hardship on the operation of the business.'" Id. at *13 (emphasis added) (quoting 42 USC § 1981a(a)(3)). What Plaintiff inferred from Lee is the inverse of what § 1981a(a)(3) provides, which does not follow logically.  Cf. Ducre v. Veolia Transportation, No. 10-02358 MMM AJW, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158897, 2011 WL 13046882, at *26 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2011) ("[A] failure to engage in the interactive process and/or accommodate a disabled worker . . . would not, without more, constitute clear and convincing evidence of intentionally oppressive or malicious conduct designed to injure [plaintiff].") Regardless, a plaintiff may not recover punitive damages under § 1981a unless he "demonstrates that the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual." 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(1). Plaintiff does not offer any evidence of malice or reckless indifference. If he does, he has not pointed the Court to such evidence.
Similarly, as to Plaintiff's second argument, Plaintiff's evidence does not show that a VCA officer, [*22]  director, or managing agent made the decision to "stop accommodating Plaintiff" (Opp'n at 18). (See Raffele Decl. ¶ 16; Frazier Dep. ISO Opp'n at 116-17; Ex. 19 to Mot., Doc. 58-26.) Even assuming that Plaintiff's evidence did support his assertion regarding who allegedly made the decision, Plaintiff does not point the Court to or proffer any evidence showing that anyone at VCA acted with "oppression, fraud or malice," Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a). Because Plaintiff has the burden to do so and does not even attempt to meet it, VCA is entitled to partial summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. Cf. Basich v. Allstate Ins. Co., 87 Cal. App. 4th 1112, 1121, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 153 (2001) ("If the plaintiff is going to prevail on a punitive damages claim, he or she can only do so by establishing malice, oppression or fraud by clear and convincing evidence. Thus, any evidence submitted in response to a motion for summary adjudication must necessarily meet that standard.").

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART VCA's Motion for Summary Judgment, as follows: the Court DENIES summary judgment on Plaintiff's FEHA, ADA, and wrongful termination in violation of public policy claims and GRANTS summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for punitive [*23]  damages.
