MEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER

I. BACKGROUND
Travis Woods ("Plaintiff"), a lifelong resident of Utica, New York, is a paraplegic due to a gunshot wound to his back. See Dkt. No. 33-2, Pl's Stmt. of Material Facts, at ¶¶ 1, 5; Dkt. No. 38-1, Def's Response to Pl's Stmt. of Material Facts, at ¶¶ 1, 5. Plaintiff cannot stand or walk because of his disability and uses a wheelchair for mobility. See Dkt. No. 33-2 at ¶ 3; Dkt. No. 38-1 at ¶ 5. Defendants Centro of Oneida, Inc. and Central New York Regional Transportation Authority (collectively referred to as "Defendants") operate the bus transit system in the City of Utica. See Dkt. No. 1, Compl., at ¶¶ 15-19. Plaintiff commenced this action against Defendants in May 2020, alleging that Defendants had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq. ("ADA"), and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq., by failing to provide bus stops that were accessible [*2]  to individuals with mobility-related disabilities. See id. at ¶¶ 1-2, 23-70.
Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that various bus stops around the City of Utica lack "accessible routes" and have "inadequate or non-existent landing pads[.]"1 See id. at ¶ 36. Plaintiff contends that, on "numerous occasions," he faced difficulty entering or disembarking from buses as a result of the lack of level landing pads at the bus stops, and he risked tipping out of his wheelchair while entering or disembarking from a bus or getting to and from bus stops. See id. at ¶¶ 37-38.2 The vast majority of Defendants' bus stops in the City of Utica are not constructed at all but are "unimproved" stops — sites with a sign in the grass, dirt, or concrete to signify the general area where a bus will stop. See Dkt. No. 32-27, Def's Stmt. of Material Facts, at ¶ 14. Although unimproved, the physical signage on the stops say that they are "ACCESSIBLE STOP[S]," and Defendants' maps and schedules also include the international symbol of accessibility on nearly every bus stop. See Dkt. No. 34-1, Pl's Response to Def's Stmt. of Material Facts, at ¶ 14.
Plaintiff reportedly complained about the "barriers" he encountered [*3]  to using the bus system by emailing Defendants on April 3, 2020, informing them that he is a qualified individual with a disability under Title II of the ADA, and indicating that he had not encountered big enough or existing landing pads at various locations, including "the bus stop at by [sic] my doctor, Dr. Kodsy, at 1703 Genesee Street; the bus stop at my pharmacy Parkway Drugs, at 250 Leland Ave; all the bus stops that serve Proctor Park; the bus stop at the 900 block of Matthews Avenue where many of my friends live; and the bus stop near the McDonalds near my apartment located at 171 N. Genesee St." See id. at ¶ 39. Plaintiff then stated that he was requesting a reasonable accommodation in that Defendants should "remedy the ADA violations" at their bus stops and "bring the landing pads into compliance with the requirements, provisions, and regulations of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act within thirty (30) days." See id. Plaintiff alleges that he desires to use the bus system, but he fears "that he will experience serious difficulty or physical harm" if he does so due to the physical barriers, such as the lack of landing pads. See id. at ¶ 43.
Joshua Gardner, Defendants' Specialized [*4]  Transportation Administrator & Systems Analyst responded to Plaintiff's email on April 20, 2020, and explained that, at a few of the sites Plaintiff mentioned, "there are curb cuts within feet of the bus stop where drivers can put the ramp down and allow for safe entering and exiting of the vehicle." See id. at ¶ 40. In other locations, where there is no sidewalk, Mr. Gardner explained that "drivers can drop off at the driveway entrance of the location." See id. Mr. Gardner further responded that Defendants "allow for courtesy stops along the route," meaning that, if Plaintiff "would like to be dropped off somewhere other than the stop," he could ask the driver when boarding the vehicle. See id. "If there are no safety issues present," Mr. Gardner stated, the bus driver would accommodate the stop. See id. Defendants have since pointed out that, in addition to the recommendations that Mr. Gardner made, Plaintiff is eligible to use Defendants' paratransit service, also known as "Call-A-Bus," which requires riders to call and make an appointment before 5:00 p.m. the day before they need a ride, and an accessible vehicle will pick up the rider at the requested time and provide curb-to-curb [*5]  service . See Dkt. No. 32-9, Gardner Depo, at 64:20-66:10. Plaintiff was only "vaguely" aware that the paratransit service existed; he never used it; and he never considered using it because he does not like to "preplan[]" his days. See Dkt. No. 32-27 at ¶¶ 4-6; Dkt. No. 34-1 at ¶¶ 4-6.
Both parties moved for summary judgment on September 17, 2021, and those motions are pending before the Court. See Dkt. Nos. 32, 33. Defendants claim that Plaintiff lacks standing, was not denied meaningful access to Defendants' transportation services, and is not entitled to compensatory damages. See generally Dkt. No. 32-26, Def's Memorandum in Support. Plaintiff, to the contrary, argues that he has standing to pursue injunctive relief, experienced discrimination by reason of his disability, and Defendants are responsible to comply with the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. See generally Dkt. No. 33-1, Pl's Memorandum in Support.

II. DISCUSSION

A. Summary judgment standard
Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, "[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the burden of showing [*6]  that no genuine issue of material fact exists. See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970). The movant may satisfy this burden "by pointing out the absence of evidence to support the non-movant's claims." Citizens Bank of Clearwater v. Hunt, 927 F.2d 707, 710 (2d Cir. 1991) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)).
Once the movant meets this initial burden, the non-moving party "must come forward with admissible evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact for trial in order to avoid summary judgment." Jaramillo v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 536 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548; Raskin v. Wyatt Co., 125 F.3d 55, 65-66 (2d Cir. 1997)). Specifically, the moving party must cite to "particular parts of materials in the record" or show "that the materials cited [by the non-movant] do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute" as to any material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A)-(B). The party opposing a motion for summary judgment "may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation," Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing D'Amico, 132 F.3d at 149) (other citation omitted), as "unsupported allegations do not create a material issue of fact," Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 41 (2d Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). "Rather, the nonmoving party must present 'significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.'" Smith v. Menifee, No. 00 Civ. 2521 (DC), 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4943, *9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2002) (quoting First Nat'l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 290, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569, 88 S. Ct. 1575 (1968)).

B. Whether Plaintiff had meaningful access to Defendants' transit system
As a threshold matter, Defendants question whether Plaintiff has standing to bring this action pursuant to the ADA and Rehabilitation [*7]  Act. The Court finds that it is clear from the allegations in Plaintiff's complaint that he has alleged an injury-in-fact because he was aware of a barrier to accessing Defendants' bus system and avoided using the bus system because of that barrier. The Court also finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that his injury-in-fact is caused by Defendants' failure to provide accessible bus stops and would be remedied by a decision in his favor. See Laufer v. Dove Hess Holdings, LLC, No. 5:20-cv-00379 (BKS/ML), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 246614, *15 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 18, 2020) (Sannes, J.); Kreisler v. Second Ave. Diner Corp., 731 F.3d 184, 187 (2d Cir. 2013). Having found that Plaintiff has standing with respect to these claims, the Court turns to the substance of the parties' motions.
Defendants contend that the Court should grant summary judgment in their favor because Plaintiff has not met his burden of showing that he was denied meaningful access to Defendants' transit system since Defendants provide paratransit services and flexibility in selecting boarding and alighting locations along the fixed route service. See Dkt. No. 32-26 at 7-14. Plaintiff responds that Defendants' "solution" to pick him up and drop him off in driveways and intersections rather than at the bus stop itself is unsafe and unreasonable. See Dkt. No. 34 at 15-16. Plaintiff also asserts that the paratransit [*8]  service does not provide him with meaningful access to the transit system because it is both a separate service from the fixed route service and it is a "lesser" service since it requires the rider to make a reservation one day in advance. See id. at 11, 19-24.
"In order to establish a violation under the ADA, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) they are 'qualified individuals' with a disability; (2) that the defendants are subject to the ADA; and (3) that plaintiffs were denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from defendants' services, programs, or activities, or were otherwise discriminated against by defendants, by reason of plaintiffs' disabilities." Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing Doe v. Pfrommer, 148 F.3d 73, 82 (2d Cir. 1998)). "Additionally, to establish a violation under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must show that the defendants receive federal funding." Id. (citation omitted). Defendants concede that Plaintiff is a qualified individual with disabilities, that they receive federal funding, and that they are subject to both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. See generally Dkt. No. 32-26 at 5-6. Defendants deny, however, that Plaintiff has proven that he was discriminated against because of his disability as defined under the ADA and Rehabilitation [*9]  Act. See id. at 5-14.
"'A public entity discriminates against a[n] . . . individual with a disability when it fails to provide "meaningful access" to its benefits, programs, or services.'" Brooklyn Ctr. for Independence of the Disabled v. Metro. Transp. Auth., 11 F.4th 55, 61 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting [Disabled in Action v. Bd. of Elections, 752 F.3d 189,] 197 [(2d Cir. 2014)] (quoting McElwee, 700 F.3d at 641)) (other citation omitted). "To ensure 'meaningful access' a public entity must make 'reasonable accommodations in [its] program or benefit.'" Id. (quoting Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301, 105 S. Ct. 712, 83 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1985)) (other citations omitted). "To determine whether a public entity has failed to make [a] reasonable accommodation, [courts] assess 'whether a plaintiff with disabilities "as a practical matter" was denied "meaningful access" to services, programs or activities to which he or she was "legally entitled."'" Id. at 62 (quoting Wright v. N.Y. Dep't of Corr., 831 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Henrietta D., 331 F.3d at 273)). Notably, "the access afforded need not be total so long as it is 'meaningful.'" Id. at 63 (quoting [Disabled in Action v. Bd. of Elections, 752 F.3d 189,] 197 [(2d Cir. 2014)] (quoting McElwee, 700 F.3d at 641)) (emphasis added).
"Determining the 'reasonableness of an [] accommodation is a "fact-specific" question that often must be resolved by a factfinder.'" Wright v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 831 F.3d 64, 72-73 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Noll, 787 F.3d at 94 (internal quotation omitted)). "A defendant is 'entitled to summary judgment only if the undisputed record reveals that the plaintiff was accorded a "plainly reasonable" accommodation.'" Id. at 73 (quoting Dean, 804 F.3d at 189 (quoting Noll, 787 F.3d at 94)).
"Title II, Part B of the ADA bars [*10]  discrimination against persons with disabilities in public transportation (among other services)." Johnson v. MTA-New York City Transit, No. 19-cv-3345 (VEC) (RWL), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21780, *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 6, 2020) (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12141-12165; Abrahams v. MTA Long Island Bus, 644 F.3d 110, 115 (2d Cir. 2011)). "The provision governing paratransit services requires public entities operating 'fixed route' transportation systems to provide disabled persons with paratransit services that are 'comparable to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities.'" Id. at *9-*10 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12143(a); Abrahams, 644 F.3d 110 at 115).3 "Failure to do so is discrimination in violation of the ADA." Id. at *10 (citation omitted).
The ADA specifies that public entities providing paratransit services must annually submit plans to the Secretary of Transportation that detail how the paratransit service complies with 42 U.S.C. § 12143(a), and the Secretary of Transportation reviews the plan and either approves or disapproves it. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12143(c)(7), 12143(d); see also Melton v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 391 F.3d 669, 674-75 (5th Cir. 2004). The Department of Transportation also regulates paratransit services as complements to fixed route service, such as by setting specific service criteria and requiring public entities operating fixed route transportation services to develop and follow paratransit plans. See 49 C.F.R. §§ 37.121-37.155. "These requirements include providing a level of service with paratransit service comparable to [*11]  the services provided to individuals without disabilities using the fixed route system." Melton, 391 F.3d at 675 (citing 49 C.F.R. § 37.147). Public entities then periodically submit those paratransit plans to the Federal Transit Administration ("FTA") for certification. See 49 C.F.R. § 37.135. "Once the plan is approved, the public entity is required to provide paratransit services in accordance with the plan. Providing paratransit services not in accordance with the plan is the prohibited discrimination." Melton, 391 F.3d at 675 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12143(e)(4)).
Plaintiff does not assert that Defendants' paratransit service is operating in a manner that is not in accordance with their FTA-approved paratransit plan. Rather, as stated above, he argues that the paratransit service does not satisfy the "meaningful access" standard under the ADA because it is a separate, lesser program from the fixed route service. See Dkt. No. 33-1 at 29-32. Because each program, i.e., both paratransit and fixed route services, do not individually provide him access, Plaintiff claims that he was denied meaningful access; and, therefore, Defendants have discriminated against him as a person with disabilities. See id. Defendants, however, argue that their paratransit system, on its own, satisfies the ADA as [*12]  a complement to their fixed route system and provides "meaningful access" to disabled individuals seeking to use public transport to move around the City of Utica. See Dkt. No. 32-26 at 7-11.
Plaintiff has not pointed to, nor has the Court found, any binding, relevant caselaw supporting his interpretation that the paratransit system and the fixed route system must each be accessible to comply with the ADA.4 In fact, that is not what the ADA requires. Under the ADA, the paratransit system is compliant, i.e., non-discriminatory, if it follows the requirements set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 12143(a). The Court therefore interprets the ADA and the relevant regulations as concluding that a paratransit system can be a reasonable accommodation that provides "meaningful access" to an otherwise-inaccessible transit system if it comports with 42 U.S.C. § 12143(a). See Brooklyn Ctr. for Independence of the Disabled, 11 F.4th at 67 (finding that "the use of paratransit [may be] a reasonable accommodation in some circumstances.")); see also Neal v. Metro Reg'l Transit Auth., No. 5:18-cv-2402, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133707, *15 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 8, 2019)5 (holding that "a paratransit system is capable of complementing fixed-route systems to provide meaningful access in accordance with the ADA" (citations omitted)).
The Fifth Circuit further explained in Melton that, "[b]ecause paratransit service is meant to act as [*13]  the disability complement to established fixed route transportation services," as required by 42 U.S.C. § 12143(a), the DOT's "comprehensive regulatory scheme signals that no interim extra-plan modification is statutorily or otherwise required by a public entity when the public entity is properly operating under a[n] FTA-approved plan." Melton, 391 F.3d at 675. The paratransit service operating under the FTA-approved plan "is itself the accommodation" to an inaccessible fixed route system under the ADA. Id. "It is the violation of the plan itself that constitutes the prohibited discrimination under title II, not the failure to modify the plan to address particularized complaints." Id. Neither the Second Circuit nor any district courts within it have concluded otherwise or even addressed this issue. Thus, the Court adopts the Fifth Circuit's reasoning in Melton to conclude that FTA-approved paratransit plans are, themselves, reasonable accommodations to inaccessible fixed route systems under the ADA.
In this case, Defendants point to Mr. Gardner's affidavit, in which he attested that the FTA performs triannual reviews of Defendants' transportation services, which includes analyzing both fixed route and paratransit services to assure [*14]  that they comply with federal rules and regulations, including the ADA. See Dkt. No. 32-23, Gardner Aff., at ¶ 5. According to Mr. Gardner, the FTA most recently reviewed Defendants in 2017 and 2021 (one year late due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and determined that both Defendants' fixed route and paratransit systems were fully compliant with all ADA requirements. See id. Mr. Gardner attached the FTA's triannual review letters from 2017 and 2021 to his affidavit. See Dkt. No. 32-24, Ex. A, at 1-3. Plaintiff does not dispute that the FTA approved Defendants' fixed route and paratransit programs after their triannual reviews. Thus, the Court finds that Defendants' FDA-approved paratransit service is a plainly reasonable accommodation to Defendants' allegedly inaccessible fixed route transit system.
Furthermore, in Melton, the Fifth Circuit found that, since the plaintiff failed to allege that the paratransit system was not operating in accordance with the FTA-approved paratransit plan, the ADA would "not impose a requirement upon [the defendant] to modify its plan to serve [the plaintiff's] particular demands." Id. As stated above, in this case, Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendants' paratransit [*15]  system operates in accordance with the FTA-approved plan, and Defendants have submitted unchallenged evidence supporting this. Plaintiff argues instead that the paratransit system is "lesser" compared to the fixed route system because it requires advanced notice of at least one day to use the system.
In its regulations, the FTA requires that a public entity seeking to provide paratransit services must "schedule and provide paratransit service to any ADA paratransit eligible person at any requested time on a particular day in response to a request for service made the previous day." 49 C.F.R. 37.131(b) (emphasis added). As the Second Circuit recently noted, "meaningful" access is not "total" access, see Brooklyn Ctr. for Independence, 11 F.4th at 63, and the FTA has clearly provided in its regulations that prior-day reservations do not preclude such "meaningful access." The Court therefore finds that, like the defendant in Melton, Defendants are not required to modify the FTA-approved paratransit plan to serve Plaintiff's demands of same-day service to constitute "meaningful access." The FTA permits comparable paratransit systems to require one-day notice prior to providing service; and Plaintiff's personal preference that he does not want to "preplan[]" [*16]  his days does not change that Defendants' paratransit rules are FTA- and ADA-compliant. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants' paratransit service provides Plaintiff with "meaningful access" to Defendants' transit system because it is a "plainly reasonable accommodation" in that it meets the ADA's requirements as a "comparable" system, which is supported by the fact that it operates using an FTA-approved plan.6
In sum, for Plaintiff's ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims to survive, he was required to prove that (1) he was a qualified individual with a disability, (2) Defendants are subject to the ADA, and (3) Defendants discriminated against him based on his disabilities by failing to provide him with "meaningful access" to their services. Since the Court finds that Defendants' paratransit service is a "plainly reasonable accommodation" that provides Plaintiff with "meaningful access" to their transit system as the ADA requires, Plaintiff cannot show that he suffered discrimination.7 Without making that showing of discrimination, the Court must dismiss Plaintiff's ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims; and the Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment in its entirety.

III. CONCLUSION
After carefully considering the entire file in this matter, the parties' submissions, and the applicable law, and for the above-stated reasons, the Court hereby
ORDERS that Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, see Dkt. No. 33, is DENIED; and the Court further
ORDERS that Defendants' motion for summary judgment, see Dkt. No. 32, is GRANTED and Plaintiff's complaint, see Dkt. No. 1, is DISMISSED; and the Court further
ORDERS that the Clerk of the Court shall enter judgment in Defendants' favor and close this case.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
