ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (Dkt. 40.)

I.

INTRODUCTION
On June 17, 2020, Plaintiff Esmeralda Reynoso ("Plaintiff") filed the operative First Amended Complaint against Defendant County of Ventura (the "County"). (Dkt. 19 ["FAC"].) The FAC alleges that the County violated both the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. ("ADA"), and California's Fair Employment and Housing Act, Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940 et seq. ("FEHA"), by failing to: (1) provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation for her mental disability of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ("PTSD"); and (2) make or engage in the good faith interactive process in order to determine a reasonable accommodation. (FAC ¶¶ 40, 44.)
On January 7, 2022, the County filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication on the grounds that: (1) Plaintiff cannot pursue FEHA claims because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies; (2) Plaintiff's request for accommodation in the form of a transfer was unreasonable per se; and (3) the County satisfied [*2]  its obligation to engage in the good faith interactive process with Plaintiff. (Dkt. 40; see Dkt. 51 [Corrected Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment].) The County also filed its Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (Dkt. 42 ["SUF"]), lodged declarations and exhibits in support of its motion (Dkts. 40, 43), and requested that the Court take judicial notice of the FAC (Dkt. 44).
Plaintiff opposed the County's motion on January 31, 2022, arguing that: (1) she exhausted her administrative remedies under FEHA; and (2) whether her requested accommodation was reasonable and whether the County engaged in the interactive process in good faith are triable issues of fact. (Dkt. 50.) Plaintiff also filed a Statement of Genuine Disputes (Dkt. 55 ["SGD"]) (which was amended per the Court's order [see Dkt. 54]), and her declaration (Dkt. 50-2). Plaintiff did not object to any of the County's evidence.
On February 15, 2022, the County filed its reply (Dkt. 57), response to the SGD (Dkt. 59), and eleven objections to Plaintiff's declaration1 (Dkt. 58). The County also lodged additional supporting evidence concurrently with its reply. (Dkts. 60, 61.)
For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS [*3]  the County's motion.

II.

SUMMARY OF UNDISPUTED FACTS2

A. Plaintiff's Work and Litigation History.
Plaintiff worked for the Ventura County Probation Agency (the "Probation Agency") as an Administrative Assistant II ("AAII") from December 2005 through April 20, 2020. (Dkt. 40-6 [Escobedo Decl., ¶ 3].) While at the Probation Agency sometime before 2012, Plaintiff believes that she suffered a mental breakdown due to work-related stress, including purported harassment and bullying by her supervisor, Chief Varela. (SUF No. 9; Dkt. 50-2 [Reynoso Decl., ¶¶ 2-4].)
Plaintiff made a worker's compensation claim based on this mental injury.3 (Dkt. 50-2 [Reynoso Decl., ¶¶ 2-4].) On October 18, 2016, the Worker's Compensation Appeals Board found that Plaintiff had suffered injury to her nervous system and psyche, and that Plaintiff reached "permanent and stationary status" on May 30, 2012, meaning that Plaintiff's injury was neither worsening nor improving as of that date. (Dkt. 60-1 at pp. 18-20.4)
While Plaintiff's worker's compensation claim was pending, on May 21, 2013, Plaintiff sued the County, asserting claims of disability discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. (Dkt. 43-1 at pp. [*4]  46-96.) The parties ultimately settled this lawsuit on July 31, 2014, pursuant to a written agreement (the "Settlement Agreement"). (Id. at pp. 98-103.)
On August 2, 2016, Plaintiff filed a second lawsuit against the County, alleging breach of the Settlement Agreement and retaliation. (Dkt. 43-1 at pp. 105-12 ["Reynoso II"].)
On February 22, 2018, while Reynoso II was pending, the County sent Plaintiff (who was unrepresented at the time) a letter arguing that Plaintiff could be liable for approximately $294,000 in attorney's fees incurred by the County defending the lawsuit. (Dkt. 60-1 at pp. 23-25.) The County offered to waive its right to seek reimbursement for attorney's fees in exchange for dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice and Plaintiff's immediate resignation. (Id.) After receiving this letter, Plaintiff took a medical leave of absence. (SUF No. 1; Dkt. 60-1 at pp. 2-10 [Transcript of Plaintiff's Deposition, Vol. 1, pp. 83:20-22, 85:16-21.].)
On October 4, 2018, while still on medical leave and while Reynoso II was still pending, Plaintiff notified the Probation Agency by email that her psychologist had released her to return to work. (SUF No. 6.) Plaintiff indicated that [*5]  she "should be able to continue to perform the essential functions of [her] position on [October 30, 2018]." (Dkt. 43-1 at p. 178.). Plaintiff attached to her email a "Disability Certificate" from her psychologist, which indicated only two work restrictions: "(1) The patient is not to return to the same department where she has been experiencing psychiatric symptom aggravation"; and (2) "minimal stress."5 (Id. at p. 180.)
On October 18, 2018, Plaintiff requested by email that the County engage in the interactive process with her. (SUF No. 16.) In response, the County held a meeting with Plaintiff and County representatives on October 25, 2018. (SUF No. 17.) At the October 25 meeting, Plaintiff requested to be transferred to an AAII position outside of the Probation Agency. (SUF Nos. 7, 17.) The County declined to transfer Plaintiff, but the County did offer to provide Plaintiff with other accommodations, including giving Plaintiff more time to complete tasks and a recording device to help her take notes. (SGD No. 5; SUF No. 11.)
On November 29, 2018, the court in Reynoso II entered judgment in favor of the County on the retaliation claim, and Plaintiff dismissed her breach of contract [*6]  claim. (Dkt. 43-1 at pp. 114-23.)
When Plaintiff returned to work on December 3, 2018, Probation Agency representatives met with Plaintiff again to confirm her receipt of the offered accommodations and ensure that her work area met her needs. (SUF No. 18.) At that time, Plaintiff requested no additional accommodations other than a transfer to another County agency. (Dkt. 40-4 [Vredenburgh Decl., ¶ 13]; Dkt. 40-2 [Koch Decl., ¶ 2]; Dkt. 43-1 at pp. 208-09, 220-21.)
On April 12, 2019, the County followed up with Plaintiff by email to see whether she had any medical changes or new work restrictions, and to advise her that the County was available to continue the interactive process meetings if necessary. (Dkt. 40-1 [Chesbrough Decl., ¶ 12].) Plaintiff did not provide any new information. (Id.)
On April 20, 2020, the County transferred Plaintiff to its Human Services Agency ("HSA") as an AAII. (SUF No. 12.) At the time of her transfer, Plaintiff did not request any accommodations from the County to perform her duties for the HSA. (SUF No. 13.) Plaintiff resigned from the County on January 20, 2021, and her official separation day was February 6, 2021. (SUF No. 14.)
During the approximately [*7]  seventeen months when Plaintiff worked as an AAII in the Probation Agency, after returning from medical leave in December 2018 until she transferred to the HSA in April 2020, she could perform the essential duties of her job with the accommodations that the County provided. (SUF No. 10; Dkt. 43-1 at p. 28 [Transcript of Plaintiff's Deposition ("Q: And you agree that as of October 25, 2018, you could perform the duties of an AAII? A: Correct. Q: And you could perform the duties of an AAII from the entire time that you were an AAII, correct? A: Correct.")].)
After resigning from the County, Plaintiff took a position with the Services Employees International Union, Local 721 ("SEIU") as a site organizer. (SUF No. 15.) Plaintiff did not request or require any work restrictions or accommodations to perform her job duties at the SEIU. (Id.)

B. Plaintiff's Administrative Exhaustion Efforts.
On November 15, 2018 (after the October 25 interactive process meeting but before returning to work), Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Commission ("EEOC") using EEOC Form 5. (Dkt. 43-1 at pp. 137-38 ["Charge"].) Plaintiff alleged that the County discriminated against her [*8]  on the basis of disability in violation of the ADA by refusing to accommodate her with a transfer outside of the Probation Agency in October 2018. (Id. at p. 137.) The Charge has one box checked to indicate that it was presented to the EEOC; a second box indicating that it was also presented to the relevant state agency, referred to as a "FEPA" [fair employment practices agency] is not checked. The Charge did, however, identify the Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") as the relevant FEPA in California. (Id.) The form's standard language requests dual filing by stating, "I want this charge filed with both the EEOC and the State or Local Agency, if any." (Id.)
The EEOC investigated Plaintiff's allegations and concluded that additional investigation would be unlikely to establish a violation, so the EEOC issued Plaintiff a right-to-sue letter on March 29, 2019. (SUF No. 4.) Plaintiff did not file a separate charge with the DFEH, and Plaintiff never received a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH. (SUF No. 5.)
Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit in June 2019. (Dkt. 1.)

III.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate only where the record, read in the light most favorable to [*9]  the nonmoving party, indicates that "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2); see also Celotex Corp.v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Summary adjudication or partial summary judgment "upon all or any part of [a] claim," is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact as to that portion of the claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), (b); see also Lies v. Farrell Lines, 13 Inc., 641 F.2d 765, 769 n.3 (9th Cir. 1981).
Material facts are those necessary to the proof or defense of a claim and are determined by reference to substantive law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "[A] complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. A fact issue is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. To demonstrate a genuine issue, the opposing party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. . . . [T]he nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
In deciding a motion for summary judgment, "[t]he evidence of the Non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to [*10]  be drawn in his [or her] favor." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. Nevertheless, inferences are not drawn out of thin air, and it is the opposing party's obligation to produce a factual predicate from which the inference may be drawn. See Richards v. Nielsen Freight Lines, 3 602 F. Supp. 1224, 1244-45 (E.D. Cal. 1985), aff'd, 810 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir. 4 1987).
The burden initially is on the moving party to demonstrate an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. If the moving party meets its burden, then the nonmoving party must produce enough evidence to rebut the moving party's claim and create a genuine issue of material fact. See id. at 322-23. If the nonmoving party meets this burden, then the motion will be denied. Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Co., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir. 2000).

DISCUSSION

A. Plaintiff Failed to Exhaust Her FEHA Claims.

1. Summary of the Parties' Arguments.
The County argues that Plaintiff's FEHA claims are barred because she never obtained a DFEH right-to-sue letter and thereby failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. (Dkt. 51-1 at pp. 19-22.)
Plaintiff concedes that she only filed a charge with and received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, but she argues that obtaining a separate right-to-sue letter from the DFEH was unnecessary because of worksharing agreements between the EEOC and the DFEH.6 Plaintiff argues that under the worksharing agreements, when she filed [*11]  her disability discrimination charge with the EEOC, she constructively filed it with the DFEH. This obligated the DFEH to initiate an accusation or issue a right-to-sue letter. Plaintiff reasons that she exhausted her FEHA claims when she eventually became entitled to receive a DFEH right-to-sue letter, regardless of whether she actually did. (Dkt. 50 at pp. 5-6.) Plaintiff's counsel argued at the hearing, "If you have the right to receive a right-to-sue letter, that's as good as receiving one." See Grant v. Comp USA, Inc., 109 Cal. App. 4th 637, 650-51, 135 Cal. Rptr. 2d 177 (2003) (holding that where the DFEH rescinded its initial right-to-sue letter and "had a ministerial duty pursuant to [Cal. Gov't Code] section 12965 to issue a second right-to-sue notice . . . one year after the filing of the administrative complaint" but failed to do so, the employee had "exhausted her administrative remedies" under FEHA).
The County acknowledges the existence of the worksharing agreements but argues that even if the DFEH had constructive notice of Plaintiff's Charge due to data sharing provisions in the worksharing agreements, that data sharing did not trigger the DFEH's legal obligation to act on Plaintiff's Charge. Plaintiff was still required to obtain a DFEH right-to-sue letter to exhaust her FEHA claims. [*12]  (Dkt. 51 at p. 20; Dkt. 57 at p. 7.)

2. FEHA's Requirement to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.
For FEHA claims, California law relating to administrative exhaustion controls. Thompson v. DeLallo's Italian Foods, Inc., 63 F. Supp. 3d 1200, 1205 (E.D. Cal. 2014). Per California law, "[T]o bring a civil action under FEHA, the aggrieved person must exhaust the administrative remedies provided by law." Yurick v. Superior Court, 209 Cal. App. 3d 1116, 1121, 257 Cal. Rptr. 665 (1989). Exhaustion in this context requires filing a written charge with the DFEH within one year of the alleged unlawful employment discrimination and obtaining notice from the DFEH of the right to sue. Cal. Gov't. Code §§ 12960, 12965(b); Rojo v. Kliger, 52 Cal. 3d 65, 88, 276 Cal. Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373 (1990).
Exhaustion of administrative remedies is a "precondition" to bringing a civil action for statutory damages under FEHA. Rojo, 52 Cal. 3d at 83. This means that it is "plaintiff's burden to plead and prove timely exhaustion of administrative remedies, such as filing a sufficient complaint with the DFEH and obtaining a right-to-sue letter." Kim v. Konad USA Distribution, Inc., 226 Cal. App. 4th 1336, 1345, 172 Cal. Rptr. 3d 686, (2014). The "failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a ground for a defense summary judgment." Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 29 Cal. App. 4th 1718, 1724, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181 (1994).

3. The County's California and Ninth Circuit Authorities.
The County contends that notwithstanding the EEOC-DFEH work-sharing agreements, each agency must issue its own right-to-sue letter to exhaust claims under the laws that the agencies respectively administer. (Dkt. [*13]  51 at p. 14 [citing Martin, 29 Cal. App. 4th 1718; Roman v. County of Los Angeles, 85 Cal. App. 4th 316, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 13 (2000); Dang v. Solar Turbines Inc., 452 F. App'x 804 (9th Cir. 2011)].)
a. Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co.
In Martin, the plaintiff filed an administrative charge of age discrimination with the EEOC, which was forwarded to the DFEH. 29 Cal. App. 4th at 1724-25. The DFEH notified Plaintiff Martin that the EEOC would be responsible for processing the charge. Id. at 1725. In the same document, the DFEH gave Plaintiff Martin notice of the right to sue in a California court. Id. Plaintiff Martin subsequently amended her initial charge to add new theories of sex-based discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Id. She did not, however, file the amended charge with the DFEH. Id.
On these facts, the California Court of Appeal found that Plaintiff Martin had not exhausted her FEHA claims. First, it held that an EEOC right-to-sue letter does not exhaust FEHA claims. Id. at 1726. The Martin court acknowledged that "a state agency such as the DFEH may, in an appropriate case . . . defer[] to the EEOC to permit the EEOC to process a claim over which either the federal or the state agency would have jurisdiction." Id. at 1728-29 (citations omitted). The court determined, however, that the DFEH should only do so in cases where it had made a "preliminary determination" that it could not "effectively seek conciliation" [*14]  and issued a right-to-sue letter for California courts. Id. at 1729.
Next, the Martin court considered whether the DFEH's inaction in response to Plaintiff Martin's amended EEOC charge entitled her to a DFEH right-to-sue letter. Id. at 1726-27. It held that the DFEH was only obligated to act on charges filed directly with the DFEH. Id. at 1727. It addressed the potential import of constructive filing under the worksharing agreements only in passing, as follows:
In the trial court Martin referred to "a dual filing agreement between" the EEOC and the DFEH, apparently intending to imply that a filing with the EEOC should be deemed a filing with the DFEH, but Martin has not renewed the assertion in this court and our own research gives no substance to the implication. Absent any showing that Martin filed her amended charge, or caused it to be filed, with the DFEH, or that the DFEH had actual notice of the amended charge from any other source, there is no basis for an assertion that Martin could predicate her lawsuit on the DFEH's inaction . . . .
Id.
Plaintiff Martin argued that requiring her to obtain a DFEH right-to-sue letter was nothing more than a "procedural technicality" that would hinder implementation of FEHA. Id. at 1728. The California [*15]  Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that administrative exhaustion serves a "vital policy interest" embodied in FEHA, i.e., "the resolution of disputes and elimination of unlawful employment practices by conciliation." Id. The court concluded that this policy interest would be thwarted if plaintiffs could exhaust FEHA claims without "formally" making their allegations known to the DFEH. Id. Indeed, the lynchpin of the Court of Appeal's reasoning was that Plaintiff Martin did not "undertake by reasonable means to make [her] additional claims known to the DFEH." Id. at 1730.
The Martin court does not explain the "research" that caused it to "give no substance" to the argument that, under the worksharing agreements, a charge filed with the EEOC is constructively filed with the DFEH and triggers the DFEH's duty to act or issue a right-to-sue letter. At least one later federal case found Martin "unpersuasive" as a result. See Reed v. UBS Sec., LLC, No. C 09-5237 MHP, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79554, 2010 WL 3119200, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2010). The district court held that Plaintiff Reed's charge was constructively filed with the DFEH the same day she actually filed it with the EEOC, such that after one year elapsed without DFEH action, "plaintiff ha[d] exhausted her DFEH administrative remedies by filing with the EEOC." Id. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79554, [WL] at *4. Rather [*16]  than simply denying the employer's motion to dismiss, however, the district court instructed Plaintiff Reed to "now proceed to obtain a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH and amend her complaint accordingly."7 Id.
Reed appears to be an outlier, however, and other courts have applied Martin uncritically to dispose of FEHA claims where the plaintiff never obtained a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH. As recently as 2020, the California Court of Appeal applied Martin and rejected the same argument advanced by Plaintiff. See Foroudi v. The Aerospace Corp., 57 Cal. App. 5th 992, 1001-02, 271 Cal. Rptr. 3d 803 (2020) (affirming summary judgment on FEHA claims where plaintiff obtained only an EEOC right-to-sue letter).
b. Roman v. County of Los Angeles.
The County also cites Roman, 85 Cal. App. 4th 316, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 13 (2000). In that case, the plaintiff obtained a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH but not the EEOC -— the converse of Martin and Plaintiff Reynoso. Writing in 2000, the Roman court concluded:
[W]e are referred to no case, and have found none, dealing with the precise issue presented here, whether a DFEH right-to-sue notice satisfies the jurisdictional requirements for a claim under Title VII. However, we see no reason for a rule other than Martin to apply.
Id. at 325-26.
Ten years later, the Ninth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion. In Stiefel v. Bechtel Corp., 624 F.3d 1240 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth Circuit considered [*17]  whether filing of a charge with the DFEH and subsequent receipt of a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH satisfied exhaustion requirements for pursuing ADA claims, i.e., a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC. Id. at 1243-45; see 29 C.F.R. § 1601.28 (setting forth federal exhaustion requirements for unlawful employment practices claims). Plaintiff Stiefel filed a complaint with the DFEH in April 2006 and received a right to sue letter from the DFEH on May 8, 2006. Stiefel, 624 F.3d at 1244. The letter informed Stiefel that, if he desired a federal right-to-sue letter, he must file a complaint with the EEOC within 30 days after receiving the letter from the DFEH. Id. Stiefel did not file a complaint with the EEOC until 321 days later, however, and the trial court dismissed the claims on that basis. Id.
Holding that the trial court's dismissal was error, the Ninth Circuit considered the worksharing agreements between the DFEH and the EEOC. Id. The Ninth Circuit determined that "Under such an agreement, a charge filed with the DFEH 'is deemed to have been received by the EEOC on the same day.'" Stiefel, 624 F.3d at 1244 (citing Green v. Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools, 883 F.2d 1472, 1476 (9th Cir.1989). The Ninth Circuit then concluded that the EEOC's failure to issue a right-to-sue letter on a dual-filed charge is no bar to a suit under the ADA. [*18]  Stiefel, 624 F.3d at 1244-45.
In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit applied the same analysis as in an earlier Title VII case, Surrell v. California Water Serv. Co., 518 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 2008), stating:
As with the DFEH charge in Surrell, by filing a charge with the California department, Stiefel was entitled to a federal right-to-sue letter because of the Worksharing agreements between the state agency and the EEOC. . . . Surrell never filed a separate charge with the EEOC nor received a right-to-sue letter from that agency. Nevertheless, we held in Surrell that "once a plaintiff is entitled to receive a right-to-sue letter (as Surrell was once the EEOC did not timely act on her properly filed charge), it makes no difference whether the plaintiff actually obtained it." [Citation]. The same is true for an ADA plaintiff.
As such, we hold that when a plaintiff files a disability discrimination complaint with a state agency acting, with respect to ADA complaints, as an agent of the EEOC, and receives a right-to-sue letter from the state agency, thereby becoming entitled to an EEOC right-to-sue letter, the plaintiff need not file a separate complaint with the EEOC nor receive an EEOC right-to-sue letter in order to file suit. Stiefel became entitled to an EEOC letter "once the EEOC did [*19]  not timely act on [his] properly filed charge," [citation]; that is, on November 4, 2006 — 180 days after his DFEH charge was deemed filed with the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e—5(f)(1) [describing notice of right-to-sue procedures].
Stiefel, 624 F.3d at 1244-45.
The County acknowledges these cases but argues that their logic does not flow in the opposite direction. At the hearing, the County argued that language in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1) authorizes exhaustion of federal employment discrimination claims by filing a charge with the appropriate FEPA, but that there is no parallel provision in FEHA to permit exhaustion via EEOC filings. The U.S. code section cited by the County provides in full:
(e) Time for filing charges; time for service of notice of charge on respondent; filing of charge by Commission with State or local agency.
(1) A charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred and notice of the charge (including the date, place and circumstances of the alleged unlawful employment practice) shall be served upon the person against whom such charge is made within ten days thereafter, except that in a case of an unlawful employment practice with respect to which the person aggrieved [*20]  has initially instituted proceedings with a State or local agency with authority to grant or seek relief from such practice or to institute criminal proceedings with respect thereto upon receiving notice thereof, such charge shall be filed by or on behalf of the person aggrieved within three hundred days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred, or within thirty days after receiving notice that the State or local agency has terminated the proceedings under the State or local law, whichever is earlier, and a copy of such charge shall be filed by the Commission with the State or local agency.
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1) (emphasis added). This language extends the time for filing a charge with the EEOC if the complainant first files a DFEH charge. It neither excuses receipt of an EEOC right-to-sue letter to exhaust federal claims (as the Ninth Circuit did in Surrell and Stiefel) nor addresses whether the work-sharing agreements create constructive dual filing.
Ultimately, Roman, Stiefel, and Surrell all address whether a DFEH right-to-sue letter can exhaust federal claims. Here, in contrast, the key question is whether an EEOC right-to-sue letter can exhaust FEHA claims.
c. Dang v. Solar Turbines Inc.
The County also relies [*21]  on Dang v. Solar Turbines Inc., 452 F. App'x 804 (9th Cir. 2011) in support of its argument. (Dkt. 57 at p. 8.) There, the plaintiff filed an EEOC charge limited to allegations of disability discrimination and retaliation, and received an EEOC right-to-sue letter. Dang v. Solar Turbines Inc., No. 07CV520-MMA(POR), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146615, 2009 WL 10671924, at *6 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2009). The plaintiff's later civil complaint, however, also alleged race, national origin, sex, and age discrimination under FEHA and Title VII. Id. Regarding his FEHA claims, the trial court found that Plaintiff had not exhausted the new theories by failing to include them in any administrative charge. Id. The trial court also found that Plaintiff had not exhausted his FEHA claims for disability discrimination and retaliation, even though those theories were included in the EEOC charge:
[A]n EEOC right-to-sue notice satisfies the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies only for purposes of an action based on Title VII. Inasmuch as Dang brings a disability claim based on the [FEHA], the EEOC right-to-sue notice does not satisfy the jurisdictional requirement that Dang have exhausted his administrative remedies as to the asserted violation of the California statute.
Id. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146615, [WL] at *6 (citing Martin). In reaching this conclusion, the trial court discussed the existence of the worksharing agreements and [*22]  summarized relevant provisions. Id. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146615, [WL] at *4. The trial court found that despite the worksharing agreements, "Federal-state cooperation does not extend to exhaustion of administrative remedies." Id.
In its unpublished opinion, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment on all FEHA claims due to failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Dang, 452 F. App'x. at 805. The Ninth Circuit cited Martin as holding that an "EEOC right-to-sue notice does not satisfy administrative exhaustion requirements for the California FEHA." Id.

4. Plaintiff's Authorities.
Plaintiff's opposition briefing on the FEHA exhaustion issue is less than one page long. (Dkt. 50 at pp. 5-6.) Plaintiff cites (1) EEOC v. Dinuba Med. Clinic, 222 F.3d 580, 585 (9th Cir. 2000); (2) Paige v. State of Cal., 102 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir.1996); and (3) Dornell v. City of San Mateo, 19 F. Supp. 3d 900, 905 (N.D. 7 Cal. 2013). (Id.)
The first case discusses how to calculate the limitations period when an administrative charge is filed first with a state agency and later deemed constructively filed with the EEOC under the worksharing agreements. Dinuba, 222 F.3d at 585. It does not address whether filing an EEOC charge or receiving an EEOC right-to-sue letter administratively exhausts FEHA claims.
In Paige, the issue was whether a Title VII plaintiff who filed both a DFEH and EEOC charge that failed to mention class claims could nevertheless act as a class representative [*23]  and pursue class claims against his employer. Paige, 102 F.3d at 1041. Paige does not mention FEHA claims, but it affirms generally that under the worksharing agreements, "the filing of a charge with one agency is deemed to be a filing with both." Id.
In Dornell, the plaintiff filed a charge for gender discrimination and retaliation with the EEOC; about one week later, she received a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH. Dornell, 19 F. Supp. 3d at 903. She eventually filed a first amended complaint alleging gender discrimination in violation of Title VII and FEHA. Id. at 903. Her employer moved to dismiss the FEHA claims, arguing that they were unexhausted or untimely. Id. at 905. The district court found that they were exhausted, but untimely because Plaintiff Dornell failed to plead her FEHA claims until more than one year after receiving a DFEH right-to-sue letter. Id. at 906-07. In discussing administrative exhaustion, the district court relied on Martin, as follows:
A claimant cannot file a lawsuit until receiving a right-to-sue notice from the agency that specifically enforces those [employment discrimination] laws. See Alberti v. City & Council of S.F. Sheriff's Dept., 32 F. Supp. 2d 1164, 1174 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 25, 1998) ("An EEOC right-to-sue letter does not satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of exhaustion of remedies as to FEHA claims."); see also Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 29 Cal. App. 4th 1718, 1726, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181 ... (1994) ("an EEOC right-to-sue notice [*24]  satisfies the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies only for purposes of an action based on Title VII").
Id. at 905-06.

5. Exhaustion Analysis.
Plaintiff's argument that Martin was wrongly decided has some logical appeal. At the hearing, Plaintiff's counsel pointed out that persons filing a DFEH charge online today can receive a right-to-sue letter simultaneously. See https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/obtainrighttosue (last visited March 4, 2022). The availability of this process means that a DFEH right-to-sue letter does not evidence any administrative investigation or attempt at conciliation. It seems to eviscerate the rationale underlying Martin, i.e., that FEHA's pro-conciliation policy objectives will be undermined unless the DFEH receives actual notice of allegations so that it can investigate and try to resolve them. If requiring FEHA plaintiffs to obtain a DFEH a right-to-sue letter does not serve such policy objectives, then it is unclear why the requirement should still exist. See Clark v. Superior Ct., 62 Cal. App. 5th 289, 293, 276 Cal. Rptr. 3d 570 (2021) ("FEHA's exhaustion requirement should not be interpreted as a 'procedural gotcha.'").
That said, it is Plaintiff's burden to prove exhaustion, and Plaintiff has not cited a single authority holding that filing an EEOC [*25]  charge and receiving an EEOC right-to-sue letter is sufficient to exhaust FEHA claims. In contrast, the County has cited Martin, a case from the California Court of Appeal, holding that FEHA exhaustion requires a DFEH right-to-sue letter, even if the plaintiff has an EEOC right-to-sue letter on the same claim.
"In deciding an issue of state law, when there is relevant precedent from the state's intermediate appellate court, the federal court must follow the state intermediate appellate court decision unless the federal courts finds convincing evidence that the state's supreme court likely would not follow it." Hayes v. Cty. of San Diego, 658 F.3d 867, 870 (9th Cir. 2011). This Court is not persuaded that the California Supreme Court would not follow Martin. Martin has been precedent in California since 1994, and California appellate courts continue to apply it, the Foroudi court doing so as recently as 2020. Indeed, the County concluded its briefing on the exhaustion issue by listing numerous, unpublished district court decisions finding FEHA claims unexhausted where the plaintiff never obtained a DFEH right-to-sue letter. (Dkt. 41 at pp. 20-21); see, e.g., Castillo v. Garrett, No. 1:13-CV-00412-LJO, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140483, 2014 WL 4792585, at *8 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 24, 2014) (granting summary judgment on FEHA claims where Plaintiff obtained EEOC right-to-sue letter but no [*26]  DFEH letter); Gordon v. The Bay Area Air Quality Mgmt. Dist., No. C08-3630 BZ, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2152, 2010 WL 147953, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 12, 2010) (same); Prejean v. Lynwood Unified Sch. Dist., No. CV0705053DDPCTX, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127224, 2008 WL 11340320, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 7, 2008) (dismissing FEHA claims where Plaintiff obtained EEOC right-to-sue letter but no DFEH letter).
Plaintiff's opposition briefing does not mention or distinguish any of these cases, although it vaguely acknowledges a "split in the authority." (Dkt. 50 at p. 5.) When asked at the hearing if he could distinguish Dang, Plaintiff's counsel told the Court that he had not reviewed that case. If the rule were as simple as what Plaintiff urges the Court to adopt (i.e., receiving a right-to-sue letter from either the EEOC or the DFEH automatically exhausts all the state and federal claims alleged in the charge), then one would expect some authority to say so directly, but Plaintiff has cited none. To the contrary, the DFEH disclaims any notion of constructive EEOC filing and automatic federal exhaustion, instead telling complainants on its website, "Understand that DFEH will not file your complaint with EEOC, and that if you wish to obtain a federal Right to Sue notice, you must visit EEOC's Website . . . ." See https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/obtainrighttosue (select "Important to Consider" from the left-hand column) (last visited March 4, 2022).
This Court is unwilling to adopt Plaintiff's [*27]  novel legal argument. The Court, therefore, finds that the County has set forth undisputed facts showing that Plaintiff neither obtained a DFEH right-to-sue letter nor became entitled to receive one merely by virtue of filing an EEOC charge, and this means that Plaintiff failed to exhaust her FEHA claims.
For these reasons, the Court grants the County's motion for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's FEHA claims.

B. Plaintiff's ADA and FEHA Claims Fail.8
The Court now turns to the County's substantive challenges to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims. The County argues that Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claims fail because (1) Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her AAII job with the accommodations provided and (2) Plaintiff's request that the County accommodate her mental disability by transferring her outside the Probation Agency was unreasonable per se. The County further argues that Plaintiff's "failure to engage in the interactive process" claims fail because the County engaged in the interactive process in good faith and provided accommodations that effectively enabled her to perform the essential functions of her job; the County was not required [*28]  to consider additional accommodations proposed by Plaintiff. (Dkt. 51.)

1. Failure to Accommodate Claims.
a. Relevant Law.
The ADA declares that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). A qualified individual is an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m). To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination by failure to accommodate under the ADA or FEHA, a plaintiff must show that (1) she is disabled; (2) she is qualified for the job in question and capable of performing it with reasonable accommodation; (3) the employer had notice of her disability; and (4) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1237 (9th Cir. 2012); see Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal.App.4th 245, 254, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000).
The only element at issue in the County's motion is the fourth one. The County argues that, based on the undisputed facts, Plaintiff cannot show that the County failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. (Dkt. 51 at p. 22.)
A reasonable accommodation must effectively enable the disabled employee to perform essential job functions or enjoy [*29]  the same "benefits and privileges of employment" as non-disabled employees, as follows:
The term reasonable accommodation means:
(ii) Modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position; or
(iii) Modifications or adjustments that enable a covered entity's employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employees without disabilities.
C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1).
Where an accommodation is intended to enable the disabled employee to perform essential job functions, to be "appropriate," the accommodation "must be effective, in enabling the employee to perform the duties of the position." Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001). An employee is entitled only to an effective, reasonable accommodation, not to the employee's preferred accommodation or accommodations that go beyond those that enable job performance or participation in the benefits and privileges of employment. U.S. EEOC v. UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d 1103, 1110-11 (9th Cir. 2010). When more than one reasonable accommodation exists, "the employer providing the accommodation [*30]  has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations, and may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide." Id. at 1111 (quoting Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the ADA, 29 C.F.R. § 1630, App.).
The "ADA does not require an employer to be clairvoyant regarding the effectiveness of a modification." Id. at 1112. This means that if after choosing a less expensive or easier accommodation but later learning that the "the initial accommodation is failing," the employer must consider whether additional accommodations would be effective and reasonable. Id. By the same token, if an employer provides an initial accommodation that turns out to be effective, then the employer has satisfied its duty to accommodate the employee's disability.
b. The County's Accommodations Were Effective.
It is undisputed that, after Plaintiff returned from her medical leave in December 2018, she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with the accommodations the County provided her, i.e., job restructuring by allowing her extra time, and an assistive device to help take notes. (SUF Nos. 10, 11.)
Plaintiff argues that these undisputed facts do not mean that the County [*31]  satisfied its legal obligations to accommodate her for two reasons. First, Plaintiff contends that without a transfer, "eventually she would not have been able to perform her job functions, and she would eventually relapse into the same condition she suffered previously by working in the same conditions as before." (Dkt. 50 at p. 10, citing to Reynoso Decl., ¶ 11.) She references evidence that she suffered work-related "mental harm" adjudicated in her workers' compensation case to be permanent and stationary in 2012. (Id. at 9; see Dkt. 60-1 at pp. 18-20.)
This argument fails for at least two reasons. First, the Court sustained the County's objection to Plaintiff's testimony about potentially suffering future mental injuries as speculative. (Supra n.1.) Plaintiff's argument, therefore, lacks admissible evidentiary support. Second, undisputed evidence shows that from October 2018 to April 2020, Plaintiff performed her AAII job in the Probation Agency without incident. (SUF No. 10; Dkt. 43-1 at p. 28.) While Plaintiff declares that working in the Probation Agency caused her to feel "the previous stress" that led to her 2012 injury because "conditions" (i.e., her supervisor) had not changed [*32]  (Reynoso Decl., ¶ 11), there is no evidence that anyone in the Probation Agency did anything to make her working conditions more difficult than those of any other employee. In April 2020, she received the inter-agency transfer she had been requesting and performed that job successfully (SUF Nos. 12, 13), foreclosing the possibility that the stress of working in the Probation Agency would eventually render her unable to perform the duties of an AAII, as she says she feared.
Plaintiff next argues that even if she could perform the essential functions of her job in the Probation Agency, the County's October 2018 accommodations were not effective because even with them, she was "immediately deprived . . . of equal benefits and privilege of employment enjoyed by others, as she was being subjected to the same harmful conditions that created her injury" years earlier. (Dkt. 50 at p. 11, relying on 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1).)
Plaintiff fails to support this argument by identifying the "benefits and privileges of employment" of which she was deprived and providing supporting evidence. Benefits and privileges of employment include compensation, insurance, leave, fringe benefits, access to facilities, and access to social [*33]  events, among other things. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) (referring to "employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment"). Plaintiff fails to explain how her access to these kinds of benefits and privileges of employment different from any other County employee. To the extent she suggests that she was uniquely subjected to harmful conditions, she is talking about working for the same supervisor as every other employee in the Probation Agency. Finally, this argument fails because this theory of liability is not alleged in the FAC. In her operative pleading, Plaintiff alleges that the County failed to provide reasonable accommodations, without which she could not work as an AAII: "Ms. Reynoso cannot perform the essential functions of the job without reasonable accommodations. COUNTY failed to provide Ms. Reynoso reasonable accommodations for the period of 2011 to present." (FAC ¶ 44.)
c. Plaintiff's Request for a Transfer was Unreasonable Under the Circumstances.
The County next argues that Plaintiff's requested accommodation, an inter-agency transfer, was unreasonable per se. (Dkt. 51 at pp. 23-26.) While the Court does not agree that it is always unreasonable to [*34]  request a reassignment, given the undisputed facts of this case, Plaintiff's request was unreasonable.
The ADA does not define the term "reasonable accommodation" with much precision. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). The EEOC, however, has promulgated regulations that define "reasonable accommodation" to include "[j]ob restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; reassignment to a vacant position; acquisition or modifications of equipment or devices; appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials, or policies; the provision of qualified readers or interpreters; and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). In terms of job restructuring, the EEOC's guidance on reasonable accommodations states that it may include such modifications as "altering when and/or how a function, essential or marginal, is performed." EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA, 2002 WL 31994335 at *14.
In support of its argument, the County cites Alsup v. U.S. Bancorp, 2015 13 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5100, 2015 WL 224748 (E.D. Cal., Jan. 15, 2015, No. 2:14-cv-01515-KJM-DAD). In Alsup, the plaintiff sought to be transferred to a different job with a different supervisor because she claimed that working with her current supervisor re-activated her PTSD and other mental health conditions. Id. 2015 13 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5100, [WL] at *1-3. The plaintiff's doctor recommended that Ms. Alsup be accommodated [*35]  with "a switch in supervisors." Id. 2015 13 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5100, [WL] at *1. When her employer refused, she sued, alleging FEHA violations. Id.
Ms. Alsup's employer moved to dismiss. Id. 2015 13 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5100, [WL] at *3. The district court held that her allegations failed to satisfy at least two elements of a FEHA disability discrimination claim. First, the court found that Ms. Alsup was not disabled; "Because the plaintiff's claimed disability stems from her inability to get along with her supervisor, and the only effect it had on her job was to render her unable to work with that supervisor, she has not and cannot allege she could perform the duties of her job with or without reasonable accommodations." Id. 2015 13 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5100, [WL] at *5. The district court also found that Plaintiff failed to allege facts showing her employer failed to provide a reasonable accommodation, because "the overwhelming majority of courts have held a plaintiff may not couch a request for transfer as an accommodation for her disability, and many specifically hold that a transfer is an unreasonable accommodation as a matter of law." Id. 2015 13 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5100, [WL] at *7 (collecting federal cases decided outside California). The court concluded, "Based on the considerable persuasive authority cited above, the plaintiff's requested accommodation, transfer [*36]  to a new position under a new supervisor, is unreasonable as a matter of law." Id. 2015 13 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5100, [WL] at *8. The court, however, granted Ms. Alsup leave to amend. Id. 2015 13 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5100, [WL] at *11.
The employer moved to dismiss her first amended complaint. Alsup v. U.S. 9 Bancorp, No. 2:14-cv-01515-KJM-DAD, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142029, 2015 WL 6163453 at * 1 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 18, 2015). The district court reiterated, "The inability to work for a particular supervisor is not a disability under the FEHA. Higgins-Williams [v. Sutter Med. Found., 237 Cal. App. 4th 78, 85-86, 187 Cal. Rptr. 3d 745 (2015).9] A transfer to a new position under a new supervisor is an unreasonable accommodation for an employee's inability to work for the old supervisor." Id. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142029, [WL] at *7. The court dismissed without further leave to amend all claims alleging "disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and failure to engage in a good-faith, interactive process on the basis of plaintiff's inability to work for a particular supervisor." Id. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142029, [WL] at *23. Plaintiff could proceed on her claim that her disability was a substantial motivating factor in her employer's decision to terminate her. Id.
In response, Plaintiff admits that "Alsup is on point factually" but contends it was "wrong." (Dkt. 50 at p. 7.) Plaintiff, however, provides no citable authorities so holding. (Id.)
Plaintiff then argues that Alsup is distinguishable. First, Plaintiff argues that, unlike Ms. Alsup, she did not request a new supervisor, but asked to be transferred [*37]  to a different County agency. (Id. at p. 8). The Court is unconvinced. In the same breath, Plaintiff concedes that "the goal [of the transfer] was to not be interacting with certain people that caused her disability," i.e., her supervisor in the Probation Agency. (Id.) Indeed, Plaintiff's essential duties as an AAII were uniform from agency to agency, so virtually the only practical effect of a transfer would have been to work with different colleagues.
Second, Plaintiff argues that, unlike Alsup, her "case does not deal with simple 'job stress,' but a disability that [] Plaintiff had that would be made worse by remaining in her current department where the conditions that caused the disability still existed." (Id. at 8.) Plaintiff mischaracterizes Alsup. There, the plaintiff alleged that she suffered from PTSD (like Plaintiff here), clinical depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety, not simply "job stress." Alsup, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142029, 2015 WL 6163453 at *1. Further, the plaintiff alleged that working for a particular supervisor "could have caused the symptoms of her mental health conditions to resurface and that her doctor recommended her direct supervisor be changed" (again, like Plaintiff here). Id. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142029, [WL] at *2.
Plaintiff next argues that, pursuant to [*38]  the EEOC's guidance on reasonable accommodations, a jury could find that her request to transfer to a different agency was reasonable. (Dkt. 50 at p. 9.) While the Court agrees that a request for reassignment could be reasonable under other circumstances, no jury could find so here.
"[R]eassignment to a vacant position" is one possible accommodation under 24 the ADA." See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). The EEOC cautions, however, that "[r]eassignment is the reasonable accommodation of last resort and is required only after it has been determined that: (1) there are no effective accommodations that will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her current position, or (2) all other reasonable accommodations would impose an undue hardship" to the employer. EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the ADA, 2002 WL 31994335 at *20; see, e.g., Buckingham v. United States, 998 F.2d 735 (9th Cir. 1993) (postal worker's request for reassignment not unreasonable as a matter of law where postal worker requested reassignment to location where he could better obtain medical treatment for AIDS, his disabling condition); Ransom v. Ariz. Bd. of Regents, 983 F. Supp. 895, 901 (D. Ariz. 1997) ("[R]eassignment of disabled employees as a reasonable accommodation . . . applies under the limited circumstance: (1) the employee becomes unable to perform the essential function of the job even with reasonable [*39]  accommodations, and (2) there exists, or soon will be, a vacant position which the employee is qualified to perform.").
By Plaintiff's own admissions, there were effective accommodations other than reassignment. The County's accommodations of job-restructuring and an assistive device effectively enabled Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her AAII job while working in the Probation Agency. Plaintiff confirmed such under oath. (Dkt. 43-1 at p. 28.) The County's duty to provide the accommodation of "last resort" was thus not implicated and, accordingly, Plaintiff's request for an inter-agency transfer was not reasonable.
For these reasons, the Court grants summary judgment as to Plaintiff's first cause of action under the ADA and FEHA.

2. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process Claims.
Finally, the County argues that Plaintiff's claim for failure to engage in the interactive process fails because undisputed facts show that the County did engage in the interactive process in good faith, and because it was not required to entertain unreasonable requests for accommodation. (Dkt. 51 at pp. 26-29.) Plaintiff argues that it is a disputed factual question whether the County failed [*40]  to engage in the interactive process in good faith by not immediately granting her request for an inter-agency transfer. (Dkt. 50 at pp. 12-15.) The undisputed facts in this case show the County had no duty under the ADA or FEHA to transfer Plaintiff earlier than it did.
"'Once an employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation, that employer has a mandatory obligation under the ADA to engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify and implement appropriate reasonable accommodations' that will enable the employee to perform her job duties." Dunlap v. Liberty Natural Products, Inc., 878 F.3d 794, 799 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1137). Through this process, "the employer and employee can come to understand the employee's abilities and limitations, the employer's needs for various positions, and a possible middle ground for accommodating the employee." Snapp v. United Transportation Union, 889 F.3d 1088, 1095; see Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1111-16 (9th Cir. 2000) (the ADA requires employers to engage in an interactive process because it "is the key mechanism for facilitating the integration of disabled employees into the work place"), vacated on other grounds by U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 406, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002). An employer that fails to engage in the interactive process in good faith "will face liability 'if a reasonable accommodation would have been possible.'" Snapp, 889 F.3d at 1095 (quoting Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1116); see 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9 (describing the [*41]  interactive process and the importance of finding a reasonable accommodation if possible). Thus, an employer does not fail to engage in that process by failing to offer an unreasonable accommodation. See Moore v. Computer Assoc. Int'l, Inc., 653 F. Supp. 2d 955, 964 (D. Ariz. 2009) (the ADA does not guarantee an employee an accommodation of his or her choosing, only a reasonable one).
The uncontroverted facts establish that the County did engage in the interactive process with Plaintiff. On October 25, 2018, the County's representatives met with Plaintiff to discuss her restrictions, accommodations, and return to work. (SUF No. 17.) At that meeting, the County confirmed that the Probation Agency would provide Plaintiff with additional time to complete her assignments and a recording device. (Dkt. 41-1 [Chesbrough Decl., ¶ 9], 41-3 [Laveau Decl., ¶ 5].) While the County did not entertain Plaintiff's request for an inter-agency transfer at that point in time, the County was entitled to see if the accommodations offered would enable Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her job before offering an accommodation of "last resort."
Plaintiff had no interest in testing the water to see if the accommodations provided would enable her to work successfully as an [*42]  AAII in the Probation Agency. Before even returning to work, she filed her EEOC Charge alleging that the County was required to offer her an inter-agency transfer immediately. (Dkt. 43-1 at pp. 137-38.)
When Plaintiff returned to work on December 3, 2018, County representatives again met with Plaintiff to ensure that her work area met her needs. (SUF No. 18.) At that time, Plaintiff requested no additional accommodations other than a transfer to another agency, and she again acknowledged that she could perform all of the essential functions of her AAII job. (SUF No. 19.) After several months, the County followed up with Plaintiff again to see whether she had any changes or new work restrictions, but Plaintiff did not provide any new information. (SUF No. 21.) She worked successfully in the Probation Agency until the County granted her request for a transfer in April 2020. (Dkt. 43-1 at p. 28.)
Plaintiff argues that a jury could find that the County did not engage in the interactive process in good faith, because the County failed to offer Plaintiff her accommodation of choice, i.e., transfer to another agency, at each of the above meetings. (Dkt. 50 at 12.) However, as discussed above, [*43]  Plaintiff's request for reassignment was not reasonable under the circumstances, because the accommodations offered effectively enabled Plaintiff to perform her job duties. Thus, the County was not required to offer or consider additional accommodations through the interactive process, such as an inter-agency transfer.
For these reasons, the Court grants the County's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's second cause of action under the ADA and FEHA.

V.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the County's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. The County is hereby directed to file a proposed judgment within 14 days of this Order. Plaintiff shall file any objections to the County's proposed judgment within 14 days after it is docketed.
