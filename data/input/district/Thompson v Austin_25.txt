Opinion


ORDER
This matter comes before the court on the Defendant Lloyd J. Austin's ("Defendant") Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 36], Plaintiff's response to the motion [DE 38], and Defendant's reply in support of the motion. Upon review of the motion, briefs, and the entire record in this case (including all exhibits produced by the Plaintiff and Defendant — see DE 1, 4, 6, 24, 25), the court finds no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff based on her disability or, otherwise, retaliated against Plaintiff for her protected activity. Accordingly, Defendant's motion is granted.

I. Background
A. Procedural Background
On July 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proposed pleading (Complaint) with a request to proceed in forma pauperis. See Motion, DE 1. The Honorable Robert T. Numbers II, U.S. Magistrate Judge, granted the motion on August 24, 2021 (DE 5) and filed the operative Complaint [*2]  with attached exhibits (DE 6). Service of the Complaint was completed on or about September 7, 2021. See DE 10-12. Defendant requested and was granted two extensions of time within which to respond. On February 25, 2022, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (DE 21); however, this court found the motion non-responsive to the Complaint under the federal rules and ordered that Defendant file an answer or other response pursuant to Rule 12 (DE 30). Defendant timely filed an Answer (DE 31) on March 31, 2022, then on April 21, 2022, filed a motion seeking renewal of his motion for summary judgment (DE 36). At the same time, Defendant filed a motion seeking a stay of discovery pending resolution of his dispositive motion (DE 34). Also that day, the Clerk of the Court issued a "Roseboro Letter" informing the Plaintiff of her right to file a response to the motion for summary judgment; that her response must include a memorandum of law, opposing statement of facts, and appendix of any attached exhibits; and that, under Local Civil Rule 7.1(f)(1), her response must be filed within 21 days after service of the motion. See DE 37.
On May 9, 2022, Plaintiff filed an "Opposition to Def[e]ndant's Motion for Stay [*3]  of Discovery and Motion for Summary Judgment" (DE 38)1 and a "Motion to Compel Production of Documents Responsive to Plaintiffs' [sic] First Request for Documents" (DE 39). Defendant's motion to stay and Plaintiff's motion to compel were referred to Magistrate Judge Numbers for disposition. Two weeks later, on May 23, 2022, Defendant filed a reply brief in support of his motion and a response to Plaintiff's motion to compel. DE 42, 43. On May 26, 2022, Magistrate Judge Numbers granted Defendant's motion to stay and denied Plaintiff's motion to compel saying, "[g]iven the nature of the claims, delaying discovery will not prejudice either side's ability to pursue its claims or defenses should the court deny the motion for summary judgment." DE 44 at 2.
On June 24, 2022, more than two months after the present motion was filed, Plaintiff moved for "an extension of time for the purpose of attempting to obtain counsel in which to file a responsive pleading [sic] to [Defendant's] motion of summary judgment ...." DE 45. Plaintiff erroneously stated that the "current deadline" for her response was "24 June 2022," and she requested a ninety-day extension of that deadline. Id. The court denied [*4]  Plaintiff's motion, finding that she failed to establish both good cause for the request and excusable neglect for her failure to make her request before the actual deadline of May 16, 2022. See DE 46 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)). The court is now fully apprised.
B. Findings of Fact2
1. The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) hired Plaintiff to commence work on May 30, 2016, as a part-time cashier on a variable schedule at a commissary on Fort Bragg in North Carolina. See DE 6-3 at 9.
2. Plaintiff's position was subject to a two-year probationary period ending May 30, 2018. DE 6-8 at 22.
3. Plaintiff submitted with her job application a Veterans Administration ("VA") Rating Decision, which lists diagnoses eligible for VA benefits purposes (including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ("PTSD"), tendonitis and plantar fasciitis of the left foot, and hearing loss—all "connected" to her military service during the Gulf War), but Plaintiff conceded it does not describe what she cannot do. See DE 6-3 at 11-12; DE 6-8 at 20.
4. In June 2016, Colleen Kemp ("Kemp") became Plaintiff's first-line supervisor. Kemp learned of Plaintiff's PTSD diagnosis, because Plaintiff stated openly in the workplace that she had PTSD. DE [*5]  6-8 at 20; DE 24-5 at 19.
5. In November 2016, Kemp directed Plaintiff to stand at the cash register by the commissary front door entrance, which caused Plaintiff to suffer anxiety and panic attacks. DE 6-7 at 4. Plaintiff was placed on bed rest and directed to submit a doctor's note. Id. Thereafter, Plaintiff requested "advance leave" from Kemp, who ignored the request. Id. For her time out of work, Plaintiff "was charged Accrued Leave resulting in a Leave Without Pay (LWOP) status." Id.
6. On January 10, 2017, after she finished her shift, Plaintiff (at a "Lead" cashier's request) assisted a customer who presented a Women, Infant, and Children ("WIC") voucher for her items. DE 6-7 at 5. The next day, Plaintiff was notified that her register had a shortage because the WIC voucher was not signed. Id. Because Plaintiff knew the customer, she was directed to ask the customer to return and sign the voucher. Id. When the customer arrived to sign the voucher, Kemp turned her away, leaving the shortage on Plaintiff's record; this situation caused Plaintiff "undue stress." Id.
7. In January 2017, Kemp reminded Plaintiff that she needed a doctor's note for her request not to work at the register [*6]  near the store's front door. DE 6-7 at 5. On February 2, 2017, Plaintiff submitted a letter from the VA Patient Advocate's office reflecting its "assistance with a letter in support of [Plaintiff's] request for reasonable accommodation to her employer reflecting an existing condition that impedes her from prolonged standing." DE 6-5 at 2. The advocate explained that while a provider had written a letter, the letter contained incorrect information, and the Plaintiff had since been assigned a new primary care provider with whom she was scheduled to visit on February 14, 2017. Id.
8. Thereafter, Plaintiff submitted to Defendant via email a letter, dated February 15, 2017, from a VA nurse practitioner (NP) recommending that Plaintiff have access to a chair at the register for intermittent sitting and that she not be assigned to stand at the workplace doorway to avoid "flashbacks of incidents from military services." DE 6-5 at 3; DE 24-6 at 2.3
9. On April 11, 2017, via email, Plaintiff requested "future leave" under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and a "modified work schedule" as an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). DE 6-7 at 9. Plaintiff submitted with the email a VA Urgent Care note, dated April 6, 2017, documenting [*7]  Plaintiff's report of a history of PTSD and bipolar disorder, and feelings of "increased anxiety and stress" because her job had prevented her from attending "her last several [mental health] appointments." DE 6-5 at 4, 5, 6. The provider diagnosed Plaintiff with "PTSD, Anxiety" and directed her to "stay on the same medications." DE 25 at 1.
10. Kemp sent the Plaintiff's request for accommodation and the April 6, 2017 note to Human Resources (HR). DE 24-5 at 19.
11. On April 14, 2017, after Plaintiff got settled at her cash register, she told her "lead" cashier that she needed to step out to speak with "Ms. Debbie" about her timesheet. DE 6-7 at 6. The lead followed her to the back where "Ms. Debbie" was located, questioning her and telling Plaintiff she "was not on break." Id. Plaintiff reports that she had to explain the situation to the lead three times, and she felt harassed.
12. On April 15, 2017, the same lead cashier followed Plaintiff to the back of the commissary after Plaintiff's sugar levels dropped, she started to feel sick, and she accepted a drink from a concerned customer and headed to the back to drink it. DE 6-7 at 6. Plaintiff explained to the lead that her supervisor [*8]  was aware of her medical condition and that she had already provided medical documentation, but the lead indicated that she did not believe Plaintiff and requested "more information from [Plaintiff's] doctor." Id.
13. On April 23, 2017, Plaintiff was placed on Cash Register 1 (express checkout) from 12:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. DE 6-7 at 6. The next day, she was placed on Cash Register 4 from 12:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Id. Plaintiff was informed at 2:00 p.m. that day that she was needed to cover Cash Register 1 from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Id. She responded that she felt overwhelmed and was on Cash Register 1 (a very busy register) all day the previous day. Id. Nevertheless, at 4:50 p.m., Plaintiff was instructed to go to Cash Register 1. Id. She explained to a lead cashier that she would not "be capable of manning that station on a regular daily basis because of [her] physical and mental impairments" already known to management. Id. at 6-7. Plaintiff considered this event "part of the escalating hostile work environment." Id. at 7.
14. On April 21, 2017, in response to Plaintiff's April 11, 2017 email, HR noted that PTSD was a disability for purposes of reasonable accommodation, but HR needed [*9]  more information because the urgent care note did not suggest accommodations or describe any limitations. DE 24-3 at 10, 11.
15. HR prepared a memorandum, dated April 24, 2017, for Kemp to give to Plaintiff regarding the process for requesting reasonable accommodation and, on May 5, 2017, Kemp gave the letter to Plaintiff along with paperwork for her physician to complete. DE 24-3 at 8, 9.
16. On May 9, 2017, customers without valid Privilege and Identification cards arrived at Plaintiffs register. DE 6-7 at 7. She notified a lead cashier, who notified Kemp. Id. By the time Kemp arrived, the head bagger, who had proper identification as a military retiree, paid for the groceries. Id. The next day, Plaintiff emailed Kemp asking that she "please not approach [her] in front of customers with paperwork, or send someone to me asking me to sign. I need to be able to read and understand what it is that I am signing. This was very unprofessional." DE 6-6 at 2.
17. On May 12, 2017, Plaintiff visited the VA Patient Advocate's office and obtained a letter stating that her next available appointment with a medical provider was scheduled for June 6, 2017 and, following the examination, the doctor [*10]  would provide a statement in support of Plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodation. DE 6-6 at 4.
18. On May 16, 2017, Kemp called Plaintiff and a lead cashier to her office to discuss Plaintiffs leave request. DE 6-7 at 7. Kemp stated that she would grant Plaintiff accrued sick and annual leave, but gave no reason why she did not consider Plaintiffs request for "advance leave." Id. Plaintiff stated she was uncomfortable discussing her personal issues with an employee present who was not in her supervisory chain. Id.
19. On May 20, 2017, Kemp called Plaintiff and a different lead cashier to her office and presented Plaintiff with a "Letter of Warning" for her "Failure to Follow Instructions" on May 9, 2017. DE 24-3 at 1; DE 6-7 at 7. Kemp asserted that Plaintiff (1) failed to follow instructions "not to do anything" until Kemp arrived at the register and again until Kemp returned to the register; (2) "allowed customers that did not have privilege to shop"; and (3) "allowed an ID card holder to purchase items for patrons that [were] not able to shop." DE 24-3 at 1.
20. Kemp has testified that Plaintiff's probationary employment could have been terminated for "ringing out non-ID card [*11]  holders" and for insubordination, but Kemp only gave a warning letter because Kemp did not want to terminate Plaintiff's employment. DE 24-5 at 28.
21. Plaintiff was upset that her employment was going to be discussed with another employee present who was not her supervisor, so she asked the store manager to attend the meeting. DE 6-7 at 7. Plaintiff also did not agree with the letter or with Kemp's assertion that she instructed Plaintiff "three times" not to do anything with regard to the non-ID holders. DE 24-5 at 28. Plaintiff stated that Kemp's act in "wait[ing] almost two weeks" to issue the letter "triggered [her] anxiety resulting in [her] leaving to seek medical attention." DE 6-7 at 7, 13.
22. Kemp signed Plaintiff's request for medical leave for the remainder of the day. DE 6-7 at 13. A May 20, 2017 doctor's note excused Plaintiff from work for the following two days. DE 6-7 at 16.
23. On May 22, 2017, Plaintiff wrote to a United States Senator from Florida, Bill Nelson, seeking "assistance with duties in a hostile work environment." DE 6-7 at 2-8. Relevant portions of the contents of the letter are set forth in paragraphs 5, 6, 9, 11-13, 16, 18, 19, and 21 of these findings. [*12] 
24. On May 25, 2017, Plaintiff emailed Kemp saying, "Here is a copy of my leave form with a letter from my doctor. I am requesting advance leave." DE 24-3 at 25. The May 23, 2017 doctor's note reflects that Plaintiff "presents today ... having undue stress at work." DE 6-7 at 19. The doctor requested that Plaintiff be excused from work for the following ninety (90) days "to allow psychotherapy and med[ication] adjustment to take effect." Id.
25. On May 25, 2017, Kemp forwarded the doctor's note and leave request form to HR. DE 24-5 at 56. Kemp also emailed Plaintiff saying, "Brandy please let me know if you received this one." DE 24-3 at 22. Nothing on the document is indicated as attached to the email and there is no explanation or description of "this one." See id. However, the court found in the record a copy of the May 23, 2017 doctor's note with a handwritten note at the bottom, signed by Kemp on May 25, 2017, addressed to Plaintiff saying, "Is this note from your doctor the answer for you [sic] R.A. letter that I gave you on May 5, 2017?" DE 24-4 at 23.
26. On May 30, 2017, Kemp forwarded her May 25, 2017 email to Plaintiff saying, "I was wondering did you receive the pdf I sent [*13]  to you asking you if this Dr. Note was the response from the RA (Reasonable Accommodation) that I gave you on [May] 5, 2017." Id.
27. On June 6, 2017, Kemp emailed Plaintiff asking whether Plaintiff received "the PDF I sent to you asking you if this Dr note is the response from the RA (Reasonable Accommodation) that I gave you on [May] 5, 2017. Please let me know ... if you are receiving these messages. This is my 2nd or 3rd one that I am sending you." DE 24-4 at 28. Plaintiff responded within twenty minutes saying:
Because I was assigned a new physician, I have an appointment this week for someone to complete. I feel as though no matter what RA I request You will only continue to ask me for more documents as though you're a doctor. This type of harassment is stressful to me, especially knowing You really lack care or compassion for me your subordinate.
Id. After this accusation of harassment, Kemp decided not to initiate contact with Plaintiff again about reasonable accommodation. DE 24-5 at 30.
28. On June 9, 2017, Plaintiff emailed Kemp informing her that, due to Plaintiff's medical conditions, two providers would be filling out the RA forms, and Plaintiff expected to have the forms [*14]  to Kemp by June 30, 2017. DE 24-3 at 26. Plaintiff also asked for a status of her leave request. Id. On June 11, 2017, Plaintiff resent her May 25, 2017 email to Kemp saying, "I am resending a copy of the original email I sent to you, just in case the paperwork got lost, I submitted both of them at the same time in original request." DE 24-3 at 25.
29. Kemp responded to the June 11 email on June 13, 2017, saying "I did receive the leave request this time around. Thank you for sending it. From May 26, 2017 to June 26th you will be carried FMLA (LS), and from June 27, 2017 to August 23, 2017 you will be carried LWOP." DE 24-3 at 24. Plaintiff responded the same day requesting a copy of the "document (DeCA Form 50-63) reflecting the reason for disapproval of Advance Leave and/or disapproval of FMLA for the remaining 60 days." Id.
30. Kemp responded in an email the next day, June 14, 2017, saying, "I am sorry I am just getting back to you. Ms. Debbie has your leave form and when I see her tomorrow I will send it to you. Sony for the inconvenience." Id.; DE 24-6 at 14-15.
31. The next morning, June 15, 2017, Kemp emailed to Plaintiff a copy of her leave request form. DE 24-6 at 16.
32. Kemp [*15]  attested that she received nothing further in response to the reasonable accommodation paperwork she gave Plaintiff on May 5, 2017, including what Plaintiff said she would provide by June 30, 2017. DE 24-5 at 19.
33. Plaintiff presented to Kemp an August 14, 2017 doctor's note requesting leave from work for a second ninety-day period. DE 24-4 at 24.
34. Plaintiff presented to Kemp a November 20, 2017 doctor's note requesting additional leave from work for "a minimum of 90 days[.]" DE 24-4 at 25.
35. Plaintiff admitted that the doctor's notes given to Kemp set out her diagnoses, but the "letters d[id] not state specifically what [she] can and can't do." DE 6-8 at 21.
36. In December 2017, Kemp's supervisor, Ervin White (who started his position in June 2017 and had never met Plaintiff), asked Kemp to "check and see what was going on with" Plaintiff and to "find out from HR what needs to be done to move on if [Plaintiff] was not coming back to work." DE 24-5 at 41. According to White, "[w]e were shorthanded and need[ed] someone who was available to come to work." Id. at 41.
37. Kemp called Deanda Glass in HR to request assistance. DE 24-5 at 22. Glass instructed Kemp to complete a "pre-action [*16]  worksheet." Id. Kemp completed the worksheet and "sent it to HR along with the required documentation." Id.; see also DE 24-4 at 13-14. As support for the requested action of "Termination during Probationary Period," Kemp wrote:
Ms. Thompson is on probation for two years which she went out on May 22, 2017 a week before her year. Ms. Thompson['s] Doctor has written a total of three notes which will be keeping her out of work for a total of 9 months. Ms. Thompson['s] last pay period worked was May 27, 2017. Ms. Thompson is holding a position that I need to fill in order to keep the business running.
DE 24-4 at 13-14. Kemp executed the document on December 13, 2017. Id.
38. Kemp testified that it was "necessary" to terminate Plaintiff's employment because "[w]e were running short handed and needed personnel in the building to maintain the store. She was not able to come to work. There was nothing else we could do. She was occupying a position that we needed to fill with someone who was available to come to work." DE 24-5 at 22.
39. White testified that it was "necessary" to terminate Plaintiff's employment saying, "All I can explain to you is when I got there Ms. Thompson wasn't working. [*17]  I looked at my personnel, and when I see employees on the roster who have been gone 6-7 months I questioned when they were coming back, and if they weren't coming back then we needed to look into hiring someone new to replace the person who was not working. Ms. Thompson was not the only employee who had been out for an extended period of time." DE 24-5 at 43.
40. On February 26, 2018, Plaintiff emailed to Kemp a "return to duty" note from staff psychiatrist, Avtar Singh, M.D., dated February 8, 2018. DE 4 at 4-5. Dr. Singh stated that Plaintiff was "psychiatrically stable and able to return to work with anticipated start date March 5th, 2018." Id. at 4. The doctor recommended the following accommodation: "schedule of 3 days in a row, 8 hours each day" to give Plaintiff a "better chance of success." Id. In her email, Plaintiff asked "to be placed on a 3-day work schedule of 8-hours, for a total not to exceed 24-hours in one week." Id. at 5.
41. On March 1, 2018, White emailed Plaintiff saying, "I sen[t] your request and accommodation to our HR Office. We will send you an email/phone call once HR give[s] us approval for you[r] return to work." DE 24-3 at 4.
42. On March 9, 2018, Plaintiff [*18]  responded to White: "Thanks Mr. White. Just saw your email. Any update on the schedule yet?" DE 24-3 at 5.
43. On or about March 16, 2018, Kemp sent Plaintiff a Memorandum notifying Plaintiff of her termination of employment saying, "you have not met the conditions of employment due to your non-availability for work because of your extensive absences for compelling reasons beyond your control." DE 24-2. The memorandum indicated that Plaintiff's termination of employment would be effective on March 21, 2018, within the two-year probationary period. Id.

II. Legal Standards
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs motions for summary judgment. If "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law" the court shall grant summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute is "genuine" if the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to find for the nonmoving party, and "[a] fact is material if it might affect the outcome" of the litigation. Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 568 (4th Cir. 2015) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The court's role at the summary-judgment stage is not "to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter" but instead "to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." [*19]  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Accordingly, the court must "resolve all factual disputes and any competing, rational inferences in the light most favorable" to the nonmoving party. Rossignol v. Voorhaar, 316 F.3d 516, 523 (4th Cir. 2003) (quoting Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., 100 F.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir. 1996)).
When the nonmovant bears the burden of proof at trial, the party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of "pointing out to the district court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the moving party carries this initial burden, the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to point out "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)) (emphasis in original). In so doing, "the nonmoving party must rely on more than conclusory allegations, mere speculation, the building of one inference upon another, or the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." Dash v. Mayweather, 731 F.3d 303, 311 (4th Cir. 2013). Instead, the nonmoving party must support its assertions by "citing to particular parts of . . . the record," or by "showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence . . . of a genuine dispute." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); see Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324.
While "it is the province of the jury to resolve conflicting inferences from circumstantial evidence[,] [p]ermissible inferences must still be within the range of reasonable probability." [*20]  Ford Motor Co. v. McDavid, 259 F.2d 261, 266 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 908, 79 S. Ct. 234, 3 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1958). It is "the duty of the court to withdraw the case from the jury when the necessary inference is so tenuous that it rests merely upon speculation and conjecture." Id. Accordingly, when the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, reveals two equally plausible alternatives, a choice of one over the other would require a reasonable jury to speculate; in such instance, summary judgment is proper.

III. Discussion
There appears to be some confusion over the claims Plaintiff raises in this case; a review of her form Complaint reveals that she alleges "discrimination in employment pursuant to ... Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 ...." DE 6 at 3. However, when asked on what bases she alleges discrimination and retaliation, she checks none of the bases protected under Title VII and lists only: "PTSD, Diabetes, and Foot Injury." Id. at 4. Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that Plaintiff believes she suffered discrimination, retaliation, or a hostile work environment based on her race, color, sex/gender, religion, or national origin. See Compl., DE 6-1 at 2 (listing the acts complained of as: "Disability discrimination, Failure to accommodate [*21]  my disability, Unequal terms and conditions of my employment, Retaliation. Hostile work environment. Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process. Failure to Prevent Discrimination. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy."). Therefore, the court will proceed to determine whether summary judgment is proper as to Plaintiff's claims that, based on her stated disabilities, she suffered an unlawful hostile work environment and unlawful discrimination and/or retaliation when her employment was terminated.
As a federal employee, Plaintiff was protected from discrimination and retaliation based on a disability under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehab Act"). Brown v. Henderson, 6 F. App'x 155, 156 (4th Cir. 2001) (citing 42 U.S.C.A. § 12111(5)(B)); see also Spence v. Straw, 54 F.3d 196, 197 (3d Cir. 1995) (holding that suit under the Rehab Act "is the exclusive means by which a plaintiff may raise claims against federal agencies relating to handicap discrimination"). The standards used to determine whether an employer has unlawfully discriminated or retaliated against an employee under the Rehab Act are the same as those used under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"). Edmonson v. Potter, 118 F. App'x 726, 728 n.1 (4th Cir. 2004) (citing Hooven-Lewis v. Caldera, 249 F.3d 259, 268 (4th Cir. 2001)).
The ADA not only makes it unlawful for covered employers to "discriminate against a qualified individual [*22]  on the basis of disability," it also requires that covered employers make "reasonable accommodations" for known disabilities so long as the accommodation would not impose an "undue hardship" on the business. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112(a), 12112(b)(5)(A). Further, the ADA prohibits retaliation against an individual who "has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter." Id. § 12203(a). Plaintiff brings four claims under the Rehab Act for (1) failure to accommodate, (2) hostile work environment; (3) discriminatory discharge, and (4) retaliatory discharge. The court will consider each in turn.
A. Failure to Accommodate4
1. Legal Standards
The ADA mandates that a covered entity is prohibited from failing to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "A reasonable accommodation is one that 'enables [a qualified] individual with a disability . . . to perform the essential functions of [a] position.'" Jacobs v. N.C. Administrative Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 580 (4th Cir. 2015) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii)). "A job function is essential when 'the reason the position exists is to perform that function,' when there aren't enough employees available to perform the function, or when the function is so specialized that someone [*23]  is hired specifically because of his or her expertise in performing that function." Id. at 579 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)). "A reasonable accommodation is one that is feasible or plausible." Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cnty., 789 F.3d 407, 414 (4th Cir. 2015) (citing U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-02 (2002)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). "Plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that she could perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation." Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., Inc. of Cal., 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994).
At summary judgment, a plaintiff who seeks to prove her discrimination or retaliation claim by indirect evidence may do so under a burden shifting method: if a plaintiff can demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to show a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action; if the defendant is successful, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant's proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination or retaliation. A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case for failure to accommodate if she demonstrates "(i) she was disabled, (ii) the employer had notice of her disability, (iii) she could perform the essential functions of her position with a reasonable accommodation, and (iv) the employer refused to make such accommodation." Cowgill v. First Data Techs., Inc., 41 F.4th 370, 378 (4th Cir. 2022); see also Smith v. CSRA, 12 F.4th 396, 414 (4th Cir. 2021) (same under the Rehab [*24]  Act). In this case, Defendant does not dispute the first and second prongs; rather, Defendant contends that Plaintiff did not participate in the required "interactive process" and that Defendant never refused a requested accommodation prior to the termination decision.
To survive summary judgment, the plaintiff must show that the requested accommodation is reasonable on its face. Reyazuddin, 789 F.3d at 414 ("To overcome a motion for summary judgment, [the plaintiff] was required to 'present evidence from which a jury may infer that the [proposed] accommodation is "reasonable on its face, i.e., ordinarily or in the run of cases."'); see also Halpern, 669 F.3d at 464. As relevant here, a request for leave is reasonable on its face if it "(1) is for a limited, finite period of time; (2) consists of accrued paid leave or unpaid leave; and (3) is shown to be likely to achieve a level of success that will enable the individual to perform the essential functions of the job in question." Wilson v. Dollar General Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 n.7 (4th Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). An indefinite leave of absence is an unreasonable accommodation. Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir. 1995).
"The ADA imposes upon employers a good-faith duty 'to engage [with their employees] in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation." Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 581. "This duty is triggered [*25]  when an employee communicates her disability and desire for an accommodation—even if the employee fails to identify a specific, reasonable accommodation." Id. at 581; see also Wilson, 717 F.3d at 346-47. This "informal, interactive process . . . . should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). Neither party is allowed to "cause a breakdown in the process for the purpose of either avoiding or inflicting liability." Crabill v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 423 F. App'x 314, 323 (4th Cir. 2011). A party's failure to communicate can undermine the interactive process. Id. This court will "attempt to isolate the cause of [any] breakdown [in that process] and then assign responsibility." Id. "But the interactive process 'is not an end in itself; rather it is a means for determining what reasonable accommodations are available to allow a disabled individual to perform the essential job functions of the position sought.'" Wilson, 717 F.3d at 347. Therefore, "liability for failure to engage in an interactive process depends on a finding that, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation that would enable the disabled person to perform the job's essential functions." [*26]  Id.
2. Analysis
In this case, the undisputed facts show that Plaintiff requested accommodations for her disabilities of PTSD and a foot injury in February 2017,5 when she requested that she not work near the front door and have a chair to sit on when necessary. Nothing in the record demonstrates that Defendant did not comply with this request.
Plaintiff also provided a doctor's note in April 2017 with her emailed request for "a modified work schedule." However, the doctor mentioned no restrictions, limitations, or requested accommodations, so on April 24, 2017, HR prepared a memorandum for Kemp to give to Plaintiff regarding the process for requesting a reasonable accommodation and, on May 5, 2017, Kemp gave the letter to Plaintiff along with "paperwork" for her physician to complete. Although Plaintiff later advised Kemp that she anticipated the paperwork would be completed by two doctors and finished by June 30, 2017, the record reflects that Plaintiff provided no such paperwork or other information from her doctor(s) with respect to any requested accommodation in 2017.
Plaintiff also provided doctor's notes in late May and August 2017 requesting ninety-day leaves of absence, and [*27]  another note in November 2017 seeking a "minimum of 90 days' medical leave. Again, Defendant approved these requested accommodations.
In February 2018, Plaintiff submitted to Kemp a doctor's note stating that Plaintiff could return to work on March 5, 2018, and requesting that Plaintiff be placed on an "8-hours per day for three consecutive days" work schedule. Kemp sent the note to White and HR; on March 1, 2018, White responded to Plaintiff, saying she would be notified when HR gave her permission to return to work. Approximately two weeks later, Kemp sent to Plaintiff a memorandum prepared by HR notifying Plaintiff of her employment termination.
To the extent that Plaintiff argues Defendant failed or refused to accommodate her February 2018 request for a set work schedule, the court disagrees. "A reasonable accommodation is one that is feasible or plausible." Reyazuddin, 789 F.3d at 414. The record reflects that Kemp had initiated Plaintiff's termination of employment in December 2017, at which time there was no pending accommodation requests, and no one knew when or whether Plaintiff might return to work (see 24-4 at 25 ("The severity of her conditions necessitates an absence of a minimum of 90 days from her [*28]  civilian employment..."); see also Myers, 50 F.3d at 283 ("Nothing in the text of the reasonable accommodation provision requires an employer to wait an indefinite period for an accommodation to achieve its intended effect.") That Defendant's administrative process took a few months to complete does not persuade the court otherwise; Plaintiff's employment was scheduled to be terminated and, thus, any accommodation request at that point was not feasible.
The court finds Plaintiff has failed to establish material factual issues as to the third and fourth prongs of a prima facie case of failure to accommodate under the Rehab Act and, thus, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted as to this claim.
B. Hostile Work Environment
1. Legal Standards
As with her failure to accommodate claim, Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim under the Rehab Act is evaluated under the same standards as a hostile work environment claim under the ADA. See Reyazuddin, 789 F.3d at 413 ("Employment discrimination claims brought under Section 504 are evaluated using the same standards as those applied under [T]itle I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990."). Similarly, because "the ADA 's cause of action for hostile work environment is modeled after the Title VII cause of action," the court may rely on case [*29]  law interpreting ADA and Title VII cases in evaluating Plaintiff's case. Brady v. Bd. of Educ. of Prince George's Cnty., 222 F. Supp. 3d 459, 472 (D. Md. 2016), aff'd, 707 F. App'x 780 (4th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted).
To prevail on a hostile work environment claim under the Rehab Act, a plaintiff must prove that she: (1) is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) was subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her disability; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) some factual basis for imputing liability to the employer. Edmonson v. Potter, 118 F. App'x 726, 730 (4th Cir. 2004) (citing Fox v. GMC, 247 F.3d 169, 177 (4th Cir. 2001)). "[The fourth] element of a hostile work environment claim has both subjective and objective components. Therefore, the [Plaintiff] must show that [she] did perceive, and a reasonable person would perceive, the environment to be abusive or hostile." Brady, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 472 (citing Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21-23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). Factors to be considered in analyzing the objective component include, "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." Id.; see also Edmonson, 118 F. App'x at 730.
The Fourth Circuit has repeatedly noted that plaintiffs must "clear a high bar" to satisfy this test, [*30]  holding that complaints premised on "rude treatment" or "callous behavior" are not actionable. Brady, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 472 (citing E.E.O.C. v. Sunbelt Rentals. Inc., 521 F.3d 306, 316 (4th Cir. 2008)). In so noting, the Fourth Circuit observed that "[w]orkplaces are not always harmonious locales," concluding that "even incidents that would objectively give rise to bruised or wounded feelings will not on that account satisfy the severe or pervasive standard." Id.
2. Analysis
Assuming Plaintiff meets the first and fifth elements for purposes of analyzing this claim, the court proceeds to consider the second, third, and fourth elements. Plaintiff has described the following conduct as "hostile" or "harassment": (1) on April 14, 2017, a lead cashier followed her to the back of the commissary asking her questions and reminding her she was not on break when she needed to speak with someone about her timesheet; (2) on April 15, 2017, the same lead cashier followed her to the back of the commissary making the same statements after Plaintiff felt her blood sugar levels dropping and needed to drink something other than water; (3) on April 24, 2017, a different lead cashier instructed her to work her remaining two hours on a busy cash register that she had "manned" all day the previous day; [*31]  (4) on May 10, 2017, Kemp sent an employee to Plaintiff at her register to ask her to sign some "paperwork" in front of customers; (5) on May 16, 2017, Kemp called Plaintiff to her office to discuss Plaintiff's request for leave and asked an employee not in Plaintiff's supervision chain to be present; (6) on May 20, 2017, Kemp called Plaintiff to her office to discuss the warning letter from the May 9, 2017 incident involving non-privileged customers; Kemp also asked a different employee to be present, which made Plaintiff uncomfortable. Plaintiff told Kemp she felt harassed and asked for leave to see her doctor; Plaintiff was then out on medical leave until her termination.
Even assuming all of Defendant's alleged conduct was based on Plaintiff's disabilities, the court finds that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate her work environment was objectively hostile under the Rehab Act. The six incidents alleged do not constitute a work environment "pervaded with discriminatory conduct 'aimed to humiliate, ridicule, or intimidate' the Plaintiff. E.E.O.C. v. Cent. Wholesalers. Inc., 573 F.3d 167, 176 (4th Cir. 2009) (internal citation omitted). Moreover, while Plaintiff may have felt (reasonably) uncomfortable with a non-management employee present during her [*32]  meetings with Kemp, it is not uncommon for management to have "witnesses" present at disciplinary meetings with employees; in fact, on May 20, 2017, Plaintiff asked the store manager also to be present as a witness at her meeting with Kemp. See Brady, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 473 ("Disagreement with the decisions or management style of one's boss, while perhaps not uncommon, do not rise to the level of a hostile workplace claim.") (citing Thorn v. Sebelius, 766 F. Supp. 2d 585, 601 (D. Md. 2011), aff'd, 465 F. App'x 274 (4th Cir. 2012)). Further, any statements or actions aimed at Plaintiff in April and May 2017 appear to be closer to "merely offensive" rather than "physically threatening or humiliating" or "odious" as necessary to be unlawfully hostile. See id. at 473-74 (three specific comments questioning the plaintiff teacher's disability that led to students mocking the teacher were not sufficient to demonstrate a hostile work environment); see also Beshir v. Jewell, 961 F. Supp. 2d 114, 128 (D.D.C. 2013) (allegations of being yelled at on a daily to weekly basis, often in front of colleagues, and subjected to threats of thwarting plaintiff's career advancement were insufficient to constitute a hostile workplace claim).
The court concludes that Plaintiff fails to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendant created a hostile work environment in [*33]  violation of the Rehab Act. Therefore, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted as to this claim.
C. Discriminatory Discharge
1. Legal Standards
The ADA prohibits discriminatory discharge. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). As noted above, for a plaintiff to receive protection from the ADA, he or she must be a "qualified individual." Id. A "qualified individual" is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." Id. § 12111(8). The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating she is a qualified individual. Jessup, 23 F.4th at 365. If the plaintiff is a qualified individual, the plaintiff can survive summary judgment of a claim for discriminatory discharge by first establishing a prima facie case. A plaintiff establishes such prima facie case if she demonstrates "(i) she was disabled, (ii) she was discharged, (iii) she was fulfilling her employer's legitimate expectations when she was discharged, and (iv) the circumstances of her discharge raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination." Cowgill, 41 F.4th at 379; see also Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., 252 F.3d 696, 702 (4th Cir. 2001). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, then the burden of production shifts to the defendant to show a legitimate, [*34]  nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge. Heiko v. Colombo Say. Bank, F.S.B., 434 F.3d 249, 258 (4th Cir. 2006); see also Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 575. After this showing is made, the ultimate burden rests with the plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant's proffered reason is in fact a pretext and the discharge was caused by discrimination based on the plaintiffs disability. Cowgill, 41 F.4th at 379-80; see also E.E.O.C. v. Town & Country Toyota, Inc., 7 F. App'x 226, 232 (4th Cir. 2001) ("Once the defendant satisfies its burden of production, the presumption created by the prima facie case drops out and the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of proving that he has been the victim of intentional discrimination.").
2. Analysis
Plaintiff's wrongful discharge claim fails because the undisputed material facts show she was not fulfilling Defendant's legitimate expectations, and Defendant's decision to terminate her was not motivated by discriminatory animus. First, at the time of the termination decision in December 2017, Plaintiff, a probationary employee, had been out on medical leave for nearly seven months without an end in sight; her most recent doctor's note stated: "The severity of [Plaintiff's] conditions necessitates an absence of a minimum of 90 days from her civilian employment..." (see 24-4 at 25). Certainly, Plaintiffs job as a cashier required that she be physically [*35]  present to perform her duties. For medical reasons outside her control, she was continuously absent and not meeting the duties of her cashier position. See Lamb v. Qualex, Inc., 33 F. App'x 49, 56 (4th Cir. 2002) ("an employee 'who does not come to work cannot perform any of his job functions, essential or otherwise.") (quoting Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., Inc., 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994)).
Second, Defendant states that in December 2017, it was short-handed in the commissary and Plaintiff "was occupying a position that [Defendant] needed to fill with someone who was available to come to work." The court finds, under the circumstances, Defendant has shown a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment. The burden shifts to Plaintiff to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact that the reason is a pretext for actual bias based on her disability, but the record indicates no such demonstration. Prior to December 2017, Defendant approved Plaintiff's requests for leave and other accommodations. Although Plaintiff reported to a doctor in April 2017 that she was not able to make her scheduled mental health appointments due to her job, nothing in the record demonstrates that Plaintiff requested time off for these appointments and was denied. Further, Plaintiff identifies no [*36]  negative comments or conduct taken against Plaintiff by Defendant because she suffered from PTSD, diabetes, and a foot injury.
Plaintiff asserts that several other employees had taken leave for the same duration or longer than she had and were not terminated. DE 24-5 at 12; see also id. at 14 ("Other coworkers were gone days longer than I was and got to come back"). However, Kemp testified that four cashiers who were permitted extended leave "returned to work within 3 months. We knew they were coming back." DE 24-5 at 27. In addition, Kemp testified that two of the employees named by Plaintiff did not take extended leaves of absence, and one of the employees was out for a total of six months before she informed Defendant she was moving out of state. DE 24-5 at 34-36. White testified that another probationary employee of the commissary was terminated for "unavailability" when she was out on a leave of absence that had "no end date." DE 24-5 at 47. Plaintiff has presented no evidence rebutting this testimony.
Accordingly, the court finds Plaintiff fails establish material issues of fact as to whether she was unlawfully discharged based on her disabilities. Defendant's motion for summary [*37]  judgment is granted as to this claim.
D. Retaliatory Discharge
1. Legal Standards
Again, at summary judgment, the burden-shifting framework is applied where the plaintiff produces indirect evidence in support of her retaliation claim. See Laber v. Harvey, 438 F.3d 404, 432 (4th Cir. 2006). To establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) her employment was terminated; and (3) the protected activity was causally connected to the termination. See Coursey v. Univ. of Maryland E. Shore, 577 F. App'x 167, 175 (4th Cir. 2014) (citing Rhoads v. FDIC, 257 F.3d 373, 392 (4th Cir. 2001)). When those elements are satisfied, the burden shifts to the employer "to rebut the presumption of retaliation by articulating a legitimate nonretaliatory reason for its actions." Id. (quoting Rhoads, 257 F.3d at 392). If the employer satisfies that burden, "the plaintiff 'must demonstrate that the proffered reason is a pre-text for forbidden retaliation.'" Id. (quoting Haulbrook, 252 F.3d at 706).
The Fourth Circuit has ruled that establishing a "causal relationship" at the prima facie stage is not an onerous burden. Thomas, 851 F. App'x at 350 (citing Foster v. Univ. of Md.-E. Shore, 787 F.3d 243, 251 (4th Cir. 2015)). "An employee may satisfy his burden simply by showing that (1) the employer either understood or should have understood the employee to be engaged in protected activity and (2) the employer took adverse action against the employee [*38]  soon after becoming aware of such activity." Id. (quoting Strothers v. City of Laurel, 895 F.3d 317, 335-36 (4th Cir. 2018)). The Fourth Circuit has previously held that four months between the protected activity and adverse employment action is sufficient to establish a causal connection at the prima facie stage. Id. (citing Carter v. Ball, 33 F.3d 450, 460 (4th Cir. 1994)).
Here, Plaintiff alleges that she suffered retaliation for filing a "congressional" — a letter to Senator Bill Nelson seeking "assistance with duties in a hostile work environment" — on May 22, 2017, when she was on medical leave. Plaintiff testified that she was harmed because of her inquiry when she was terminated. DE 24-5 at 13. She also expressed her belief that the inquiry motivated her termination because Kemp "[was] mad because I took it higher, over her head. I believe she was suspended or punished from the congressional complaint, and because she was punished, she [ ] punished me by terminating me." Id. Plaintiff did not provide any evidential support for this belief.
Apparently, Plaintiff's "congressional" prompted an internal investigation in July 2017 by senior DeCA Zone Manager, Michael Pulley, who determined that no hostile work environment existed. See DE 6-8 at 2. Pulley testified that he spoke only with Kemp [*39]  because Plaintiff was out on medical leave. See DE 24-5 at 65-66. Kemp testified that she learned about the "congressional" in July 2017 and, following her meeting with Pulley, she never heard "anything more about it" and was "not aware what happened after Mr. Pulley left or what the outcome of the congressional was." DE 24-5 at 18.
Five months passed between Kemp's notice of the "congressional" and her initiation of Plaintiffs termination. Plaintiff provides no information from which this court may infer that any conduct or other circumstance during this period demonstrates a causal connection. Moreover, as set forth above, Plaintiff has not come forward with evidence establishing material factual issues rebutting Defendant's non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination. See Laber, 438 F.3d at 432 ("Even assuming that Laber demonstrated a prima facie case of retaliation, the Army satisfied its burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his non-selection"); see also Haulbrook, 252 F.3d at 706 ("even if there is a question of fact as to causation, the question is not material because the proffered legitimate reason for Haulbrook's termination ... was not rebutted effectively"). The court concludes that [*40]  Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Plaintiff suffered unlawful retaliation when she was terminated from employment with Defendant. Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted as to this claim.
E. State Law Claims
Defendant did not raise any arguments concerning Plaintiff's alleged state law claims; however, a court may sua sponte determine whether it retains jurisdiction over a matter. A district court may elect whether to retain or to decline to exercise jurisdiction over state law claims pursued by a plaintiff. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). Section 1367(c) provides that "district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if— ... (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction." Here, the court has dismissed Plaintiff's Rehab Act claims; however, even if the court were to elect to retain pendent jurisdiction, Plaintiff's state law claims must be dismissed.
First, Plaintiff alleges that she has suffered "discrimination in employment pursuant to ... Chapter 168A, Persons with Disabilities Protection Act," which is a North Carolina statute prohibiting disability discrimination in employment and other circumstances. The Act prohibits discriminatory [*41]  practices based on "disabling conditions"; relevant here, the statute finds it "discriminatory" for "[a]n employer to fail to hire or consider for employment or promotion, to discharge, or otherwise to discriminate against a qualified person with a disability on the basis of a disabling condition with respect to compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." N.C.G.S. § 168A-5(a)(1). The statute defines "employer" as "[a]ny person employing 15 or more full-time employees within the State," and a "person" as "[a]ny individual, partnership, association, corporation, labor organization, legal representative, trustee, receiver, and the State and its departments, agencies, and political subdivisions." The federal government is not listed as a person prohibited from engaging in discriminatory practices under N.C.G.S. § 168A. Moreover, as set forth above, the Rehabilitation Act provides the exclusive remedy for claims based on a federal employee's disability. Brown, 6 F. App'x at 156; Spence, 54 F.3d at 197.
Moreover, Plaintiff asserts a claim for "wrongful termination in violation of public policy," which is a tort claim under North Carolina law. "Absent a statutory waiver, sovereign immunity shields the United States from a civil tort suit." Colburn v. United States, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2022 WL 2955280, at *2 (E.D. Va. July 26, 2022) (quoting Kerns v. United States, 585 F.3d 187, 19394 (4th Cir. 2009)). The Federal [*42]  Tort Claim Act ("FTCA") serves as a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, permitting suit against the United States for "certain torts committed by federal employees." Id. (citing FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S. Ct. 996, 127 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1994)). The FTCA grants jurisdiction to district courts under specifically prescribed circumstances, and "the circumstances of [the United States'] waiver must be scrupulously observed and not expanded by the court." Id. (quoting Kokotis v. United States Postal Serv., 223 F.3d 275, 278 (4th Cir. 2000)). Any "ambiguities are resolved in favor of the sovereign." Id. (quoting Robb v. United States, 80 F.3d 884, 887 (4th Cir. 1996)).
The FTCA prohibits the filing of a civil action against the government unless the underlying claim is "first presented" to an appropriate federal agency and subsequently denied. 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a). Where such a claim is not first presented to the appropriate agency, a district court must dismiss the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S. Ct. 1980, 124 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1993) (district court properly dismissed FTCA suit where plaintiff had not exhausted available administrative remedies); see also Henderson v. United States, 785 F.2d 121, 123 (4th Cir. 1986) ("well-settled" that exhaustion requirement is "jurisdictional").
Thus, Defendant is shielded from suit for employment claims under North Carolina law and, otherwise, there is no indication in the record that Plaintiff has exhausted administrative remedies for [*43]  any FTCA claim. Accordingly, Plaintiff's state law statutory and common law claims are dismissed without prejudice for the court's lack of jurisdiction.

IV. Conclusion
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact as to her claims under the Rehabilitation Act, as required by Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and, thus, Defendant's motion for summary judgment [DE 36] is GRANTED. In addition, this court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff's purported state law claims and they are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Therefore, the Clerk of the Court is DIRECTED to close this case.6
