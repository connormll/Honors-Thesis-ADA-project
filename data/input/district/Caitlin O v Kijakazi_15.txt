Opinion



MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Caitlin O. brought this action seeking to reverse the final decision of the Acting Commissioner of Social Security, Kilolo Kijakazi ("Defendant" or "the Commissioner"), denying her application for Disability Insurance Benefits ("DIB") and Supplemental Security Income ("SSI") under Titles II and [*2]  XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 401-434, 1381-1383f. She contends that the decision of the Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") is marred by numerous errors that require either reversal and remand for a calculation of benefits or, at least, remand for a new hearing before an ALJ. An overarching theme of Plaintiff's arguments is that the ALJ failed to consider evidence in the record that contradicted his conclusions and cherry-picked evidence that supported it, but Plaintiff also targets more specific alleged errors, including the ALJ's analysis of the Listings and his treatment of the opinions of two of her treating physicians. The Commissioner contends that the ALJ's decision is free from legal error and supported by substantial evidence. This case was referred to the undersigned to prepare a report and recommendation in May 2022.3 For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion should be denied and Defendant's motion should be granted.4

I. BACKGROUND

A. Statutory and Regulatory Framework
To be eligible for SSI or DIB benefits under the Social Security Act, the Social Security Administration ("SSA") must find a claimant to be "disabled," meaning that the individual is "[unable] [*3]  to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months." 42 U.S.C. §§ 423(d)(1)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(A). To make that determination, an ALJ gathers evidence, holds a hearing, takes testimony, and performs the following five-step, sequential inquiry of the disability claim:
Step one: whether the claimant is engaging in "substantial gainful activity";5
Step two: whether the claimant has a "severe" medically-determinable physical or mental impairment or combination of impairments;6
Step three: whether the claimant's impairment or combination of impairments is equivalent to one of the disabling impairments listed in the appendix of the relevant regulation, 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 (the "Listings");
Step four: whether, in light of the claimant's RFC, the impairment prevents the claimant from performing his or her past relevant work;7 and
Step five: whether the claimant, in light of his or her age, education, work experience, and RFC—i.e., the most he or she is able to do notwithstanding his or her physical and mental limitations—is unable to perform another job [*4]  available in the national economy.8
See 20 C.F.R. § 416.920; see also 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520 (outlining the five-step sequential inquiry for the purposes of DIB claims); Butler v. Barnhart, 353 F.3d 992, 997, 359 U.S. App. D.C. 267 (D.C. Cir. 2004). "An affirmative answer to question 1 or negative answers to questions 2 or 4 result in a determination of no disability. Affirmative answers to questions 3 or 5 establish disability." Hines v. Bowen, 872 F.2d 56, 58 (4th Cir. 1989).
The claimant bears the burden of proof at the first four steps of the evaluation. Callahan v. Astrue, 786 F. Supp. 2d 87, 89 (D.D.C. 2011). At step five, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to identify specific jobs available in the national economy that the claimant can perform. Id. In making this determination, an ALJ may call a vocational expert to testify at the hearing as to whether, based on the claimant's RFC, he or she can perform other work that exists in the national economy. Id. at 90.

B. Plaintiff's Disability Claims and Procedural History
Plaintiff was born on March 27, 1985. ECF No. 17-5 at 2, 4. She has a bachelor's degree. ECF No. 17-2 at 53. She has past relevant work as a sales associate. Id. at 39, 54; ECF No. 17-6 at 6. At the time of the hearing before the ALJ, she was 31 years old. See ECF No. 17-2 at 51. Plaintiff filed applications for disability insurance benefits and [*5]  for supplemental security income in October of 2013. ECF No. 17-5 at 2, 4. She claimed a disability onset date of December 9, 2012, due to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ("POTS"),9 migraine headaches, dyslexia, and panic attacks. ECF Nos. 17-5 at 2, 4 & 17-6 at 5.
Plaintiff's applications were each initially denied on February 4, 2014, and upon reconsideration on April 4, 2014. ECF No. 17-3 at 2-25, 29-56. She then requested a hearing before an ALJ, ECF No. 17-4 at 15-16, which was held on June 17, 2016, ECF No. 17-2 at 47-84. Both Plaintiff and a vocational expert testified at the hearing. See ECF No. 17-2 at 48. Plaintiff testified that she had last worked as a salesclerk at a boutique inside Bloomingdale's at the Tysons Corner mall in March 2013. Id. at 53. She reportedly left the job—she testified that she thought she resigned but "at some point" her employer said she abandoned the job—because she had migraines and "wasn't getting any better to be able to work." Id.; see also id. at 61.
Addressing her impairments, Plaintiff testified that she was being treated with medications, physical therapy, and acupuncture. Id. at 58. She was [*6]  diagnosed with latent tuberculosis, for which she completed the nine-month course of antibiotics, but doctors warned that if her immune system is suppressed through medication, for example, it could return. Id. at 58-59. She has experienced symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome since she was in high school and her flare-ups had increased since she stopped working, requiring her to "stay close to a bathroom on those days" or take prophylactic medication. Id. at 60. Because of low blood volume, she had to keep her sodium and fluid intake up, which caused her to urinate "around every hour." Id. at 72, 74. According to Plaintiff, her blood pressure could fluctuate wildly in a day, from 110 over 75 to 140 over 100, and such fluctuations caused headaches, diarrhea, and nausea. Id. at 73. Plaintiff testified that her cardiologist had recently adjusted the medication prescribed to treat her POTS because the antidepressant she was on "raises your blood pressure also." Id. at 60. The antidepressant—which she had been taking for one week at the time of the hearing—also provided pain relief from her connective tissue disorder, but she suspected it was increasing her migraines, which [*7]  she said occurred twice per week and could last from two hours to two days with residual effects of up to two days. Id. at 62, 72. Prior to the new antidepressant, her migraines were less frequent and of shorter duration, occurring once per week and lasting for approximately one day, although she could sometimes medicate with Tylenol and aspirin to prevent a headache from blossoming into a "full blown migraine." Id. at 63. When she last worked (in 2012 and 2013), the migraines were even less frequent, occurring about once per month. Id. She testified that, over the long term, she has had migraines as frequently as three times per week and as rarely as once every three months. Id. at 64.
As to activities of daily living, Plaintiff stated at the hearing that she lived in a house with her sister. Id. at 52. She testified that she drove approximately one day per week and only drove when she felt "completely comfortable to." Id. She could walk for ten minutes, stand for five minutes before "the blood pool[ed] in [her] feet," sit for twenty minutes without her legs elevated, and lift five to ten pounds. Id. at 64-65. She could bathe alone using a shower chair as long as someone was at home [*8]  with her. Id. at 66-67. Both she and her sister cooked—eating "a lot of microwave meals"—and their groceries were delivered. Id. at 67. Plaintiff could do laundry with the help of her sister but did not do any other housework or take care of the yard. Id. She considered sewing her "career," as her bachelor's degree was in fashion design; she had recently made a dress but stopped before it was completed because she did not feel comfortable using the sewing machine or overlock machine. Id. at 68-69. She stopped drinking alcohol in 2012 because she "didn't want to add to whatever was going on." Id. at 66. Accompanied by her sister, she was able to fly to California to see her parents in 2013 or 2014, but the itinerary had to include a layover because of a concern about blood clots. Id. at 70, 74. Plaintiff testified that she rarely left the house except for medical appointments and an occasional lunch with her cousin; rather, she spent most of the time when she was home alone checking Facebook, looking at fashion websites and blogs, watching television with her legs elevated, or lying down. Id. at 69-71. She estimated that up to five days a week she had to elevate her legs "throughout [*9]  the whole day, kind of constantly" and she also wore compression tights to "keep[ ] the blood flow and the fluid retention closer to [her] heart." Id. at 74-75. On her worst days, which occurred approximately twice per week, she testified that she had trouble getting out of bed, would go downstairs to eat a meal, and fall asleep. Id. at 75.
At the close of Plaintiff's testimony, the vocational expert provided his evidence in response to a series of hypotheticals posed by the ALJ. As relevant here, the ALJ proposed an individual of Plaintiff's age, education, and work experience who could perform the full range of light work, except could only occasionally climb ramps and stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; could never climb ropes, ladders, or scaffolds; and must avoid concentrated exposure to extreme cold and heat and hazards such as dangerous machinery and unprotected heights.10 Id. at 78-79. The vocational expert testified that such an individual could perform Plaintiff's past work as a sales associate. Id. at 79. If that individual were additionally limited to "simple, routine, repetitive tasks with no production rate or pace of work," she could not perform Plaintiff's [*10]  past work, but could perform the jobs of table worker, machine tender, general office helper, quality control worker, grading and sorting worker, and finish machine operator. Id. at 78-79. Those six identified jobs would remain if the individual had to alternate between sitting and standing every 30 minutes.11 Id. at 79-80. If limited to sedentary work,12 the vocational expert said the same individual could perform the jobs of quality control worker, grading and sorting worker, and finish machine operator. Id. at 78-79. Plaintiff's representative then posed a hypothetical individual of Plaintiff's age, education, and work experience who had the limitations outlined in the ALJ's first, and least restrictive, hypothetical—that is, someone who could perform the full range of light work, except could only frequently climb ramps and stairs and balance; could only occasionally stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; could never climb ropes, ladders, or scaffolds; must avoid concentrated exposure to extreme cold and heat and hazards such as dangerous machinery and unprotected heights; and could perform only "simple, routine, repetitive tasks with no production rate or pace of work—but would also need [*11]  to "elevate their legs to at least heart level" for a minimum of two hours per day. Id. at 81. The vocational expert testified that such an individual would not be able to maintain employment. Id. Nor would such an individual who did not need to elevate her legs but who would be absent from work at least two days per month "due to preoccupation with medical symptomology." Id. at 82.

C. The ALJ's Decision
The ALJ issued his decision denying benefits on August 10, 2016. ECF No. 17-2 at 27-41. That decision became the final decision of the Commissioner when the Appeals Council denied review on August 16, 2017. Id. at 2-5.
1. Substantial Gainful Employment, Severe Impairments, and the Listings At step one, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date, December 9, 2012.13 ECF No. 17-2 at 29. At step two, he found that Plaintiff had seven impairments that should be classified as "severe" under the regulations: POTS, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,14 migraines, chronic fatigue syndrome, gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and obesity. Id. The ALJ found Plaintiff's affective mood disorder, anxiety-related disorder, and sleep-related disorder [*12]  were non-severe because they "have no more than a minimal limitation on [Plaintiff's] ability to perform basic work activities." Id. at 29-30.
More specifically, he noted that Plaintiff's sleep apnea was well-controlled by continuous positive airway pressure—CPAP—therapy. Id. at 30. He further found that none of Plaintiff's medically-determinable mental impairments caused any more than mild limitation in the four broad areas of mental functioning—known as the "paragraph B" criteria—then identified in the Listings.15 Id. The ALJ found that Plaintiff had no limitation in activities of daily living or social functioning, noting that her affective mood disorder and anxiety-related disorder were effectively controlled by medication; that although she described limited activities of daily living in a 2013 function report and at the hearing, those limitations were attributed primarily to her physical impairments, and she also testified that she could drive once per week, look at fashion websites and blogs, use Facebook, make garments, and she was able to travel to California with her sister in 2013 to visit her parents. Id. (citing ECF No. 17-6 at 73-80 [*13]  (2013 function report) and hearing testimony). Although that 2013 function report also reported "anger, frustration, and few social interactions" and examinations "reveal[ed] anxiety at times," she was cooperative at the consultative psychological examination in January 2014. Id. (citing, among other medical records, ECF No. 17-10 at 17-23 (consultative psychological and intelligence examination)). More, she was able to spend time with her family and had not been fired from a job due to problems getting along with others. Id. The ALJ found mild limitations in concentration, persistence or pace, stating that Plaintiff "allege[d] that her impairments affect her memory, concentration, attention, and understanding," but pointing out that the consultative examiner "observed coherent and goal directed thought process, clear sensorium, average cognitive functioning, and good attention and concentration." Id. As to the fourth and final area of mental functioning—episodes of decompensation—the ALJ noted that Plaintiff "ha[d] not been hospitalized due to a mental impairment or experienced a temporary increase in signs or symptoms accompanied by a loss of adaptive functioning." Id. Because the [*14]  degree of limitation traceable to Plaintiff's mental impairments was rated no higher than "mild," the ALJ found those impairments not severe pursuant to the regulations. Id. (citing 22 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(d)(1), 416.920a(d)(1) ("If we rate the degree of your limitation as 'none' or 'mild,' we will generally conclude that your impairment(s) is not severe . . . .").
At step three, the ALJ considered whether Plaintiff's impairments met or medically equaled in severity an impairment in the Listings.16 Id. at 31. He considered Listing 4.05, for recurrent arrhythmia, and Listing 14.06, for undifferentiated and mixed connective tissue disease, as well as the Listings for digestive systems and neurological disorders. As to Listing 4.05, the ALJ found it was not met or medically equaled because "the medical record does not document uncontrolled, recurrent episodes of cardiac syncope or near syncope despite prescribed treatment."17 Id. He noted that medical records showed Plaintiff's POTS "dramatically improved" with the medications midodrine and Florinef. Id. (citing, generally, medical records from September 2012 to May 2016). Listing 14.06 was not met, the ALJ found, because "the medical record does not document at least two of the constitutional symptoms or signs" [*15]  of fatigue, fever, malaise, and involuntary weight loss.18 Id. The ALJ noted Plaintiff's diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome but found no evidence in the medical record of "fever, malaise, or involuntary weight loss." Id.
The Listings for digestive system disorders—the 5.00 series of Listings—were not met because "the medical record does not document gastrointestinal hemorrhaging, inflammatory bowel disease, or weight loss." Id. Rather, Plaintiff's gastritis and irritable bowel syndrome improved with medication. Id. The Listings for neurological disorders—the 11.00 series of Listings—were not met because "the medical record does not document headaches occurring more frequently than once weekly." Id. The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's obesity "considered singly or in combination with her other impairments" did not meet or equal any Listing.19 Id. The ALJ therefore proceeded to determine Plaintiff's RFC.
2. Plaintiff's RFC
Prior to determining whether Plaintiff could engage in past relevant work at step four, the ALJ determined that the claimant had the RFC to perform light work—which, as noted above, see supra note 10, requires lifting up to 20 pounds [*16]  at a time and lifting or carrying objects weighing up to 10 pounds off and on for up to six hours of a regular workday, and may require up to six hours of standing or walking, see 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1567(b), 416.967(b); Social Security Ruling ("SSR") 83-10, 1983 SSR LEXIS 30, 1983 WL 31251, at *5-6—with several additional limitations: Plaintiff could never climb ladders, ropes or scaffolds; could occasionally (from one-third to two-thirds of a workday) climb ramps and stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; must avoid concentrated exposure to extreme heat and cold and exposure to hazards such as moving machinery; and could "tolerate no production rate for pace of work." ECF No. 17-2 at 31.
In determining the RFC, the ALJ began by explaining that he considered the entire record, including Plaintiff's symptoms and their consistency with the medical and other evidence in the record. Id. The ALJ also explained that he engaged in the required "two-step process" when considering Plaintiff's symptoms, first considering whether her medically determinable impairments could be expected to produce her symptoms, and then evaluating the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of her symptoms to determine the extent to which they limited her work-related activities. Id. at 31-32. Ultimately, the [*17]  ALJ found that although Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of POTS, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, migraine, gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, depression, panic attacks, anxiety, affective mood disorder, anxiety-related disorder, dyslexia, and obstructive sleep apnea could reasonably be expected to cause her alleged symptoms, her statements concerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of her symptoms were not entirely consistent with the medical and other evidence in the record. Id. at 33, 35, 36. In so finding, the ALJ first recounted Plaintiff's hearing testimony in detail. Id. at 32-33. He then addressed Plaintiff's treatment and examination records for each of the identified impairments before turning to the opinion evidence. Id. at 33-39.

a. Records Relating to Physical Impairments
Plaintiff claimed blood pressure fluctuations from POTS caused her headaches, nausea, frequent urination, diarrhea, and required her to elevate her legs throughout the day. Id. at 33. The ALJ noted that Plaintiff visited the emergency room on December 9, 2012 (the alleged onset date) complaining of dizziness (among other things). Id. at 33; see also ECF No. 17-8 at 17. [*18]  She followed up in the ensuing days with her primary care physician, Katherine David, D.O., who noted normal audiology testing, but observed an "unsteady wide stance gait" and slow movement. ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-8 at 36. An MRI performed on December 18, 2012, was normal, as was an electrocochleography (ECOG) study and videonystagmography (VNG) performed on December 28, 2012.20 ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-8 at 39; ECF No. 17-10 at 88. On March 25, 2013, neurologist Elham Bayat examined her and found signs "suggestive of POTS." ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 60-61. She saw a cardiologist in April 2013—Marco A. Mercador, M.D.—who, upon examination, found that she had a "marked increase in [her] sinus rate from supine to standing, meeting criteria for POTS." ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 58-59. He prescribed midodrine, compression stockings, aerobic exercise, and an increase in fluid and salt intake.21 ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-6 at 70; ECF No. 17-9 at 59. In a November 2013 examination, cardiologist Allen Solomon, M.D., prescribed midodrine and Florinef.22 ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 47. The combination [*19]  of drugs caused her symptoms to "improve[ ] dramatically," and, although she was "not back to baseline," she was no longer fainting. ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 34. Plaintiff's rheumatologist, Mandana Hashefi, M.D., noted improved symptoms of POTS in November 2014 and February 2015, and thereafter, reported that Plaintiff's POTS remained "stable" through November 2015. ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 94, 97, 103, 110. In that same period, Plaintiff's primary care physician reported that she was "doing great on her current regimen." ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 9. Although Plaintiff reported low blood pressure in October 2015, an increase in her midodrine dosage improved her symptoms. ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 87. In November 2015, Plaintiff's cardiologist Dr. Solomon reported that an increase in her Florinef dosage had "dramatic[ally] improve[d]" her POTS symptoms and that she was "doing very well from a cardiac standpoint." ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 66-67. In January 2016, her primary care physician reported that Cymbalta had improved her blood pressure readings. ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF [*20]  No. 17-12 at 53, 55.
From those records, the ALJ found that Plaintiff's POTS was controlled with medication and that, although she sometimes reported increased symptoms, adjustments in her medication dosages resulted in improvements. ECF No. 17-2 at 33. Addressing Plaintiff's asserted need to elevate her legs, the ALJ found that treatment records show neither that she reported such a need nor that her doctors instructed her to do so. Id. The ALJ noted a report from Dr. David in September 2013 of non-pitting edema but noted that Plaintiff wore compression stockings and there was no evidence that treatment was ineffective. Id. at 33-34; see also ECF No. 17-8 at 81. The ALJ further found no evidence in the medical records to corroborate Plaintiff's report of hourly urination. ECF No. 17-2 at 34.
The ALJ further found that the treatment record did not support Plaintiff's claims as to the frequency, duration, and symptoms accompanying her migraine headaches. ECF No. 17-2 at 34. The ALJ noted that Plaintiff complained of migraines when she presented at the emergency [*21]  room on the alleged onset date in December 2012. Id.; see also ECF No. 17-8 at 13. In March 2013, she complained of migraines at a visit to neurologist Dr. Bayat, who prescribed propranolol. ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 61. At a January 2014 visit, Dr. Bayat diagnosed that Plaintiff's headaches were "under control," but reduced her propranolol dosage frequency "to see if it helped with her complaints of brain fog." ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 33. In August 2015 Plaintiff reported that she had no recent episodes of migraine and in October 2015, she reported that her migraine was well-controlled with only one episode since August. ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 87, 102. The ALJ recognized that Plaintiff testified that the frequency of her migraines "varied from three times a week to once every three months" but found that since starting propranolol, "the medical evidence documents infrequent migraines and does not support" her claims that she had headaches twice per week lasting two hours to two days and requiring a day or two to recover. ECF No. 17-2 at 34.
Regarding Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the ALJ noted that Plaintiff had complained of [*22]  weakness "on several occasions in 2013 and examinations by a neurologist revealed weakness." ECF No. 17-2 at 34. She began seeing rheumatologist Dr. Hashefi in February 2014, complaining of "generalized pain, morning pain and stiffness, and [parasthesia]." Id.; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 139, 141. At that visit, Dr. Hashefi found that Plaintiff had full strength with the exception of her shoulder (which was at 4 out of 5) and full range of motion. ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 140-41. Dr. Hashefi proscribed Plaquenil23 and, later, gabapentin. ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 110, 131. Plaintiff noted improvement in her symptoms throughout 2014 and early 2015; indeed, in February 2015, "her weakness had almost resolved." ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 105, 110, 114, 120, 125, 129. However, throughout 2015, Plaintiff met five out of nine Beighton criteria.24 ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 96, 99, 105. Nevertheless, the ALJ found that Plaintiff's Ehlers-Danlos syndrome improved significantly with medication and that, other than her scores on the Beighton scale, her physical examinations were "largely unremarkable for findings related [*23]  to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome." ECF No. 17-2 at 34.
As for Plaintiff's allegation of "diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome," Plaintiff began seeing gastroenterologist Antionette Saddler, M.D., in December 2013. ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 44. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy performed in March 2014 were unremarkable. ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 142-44. Dr. Saddler diagnosed gastritis and noted multiple times in 2015 that it was well-controlled, although there was some mild epigastric sensitivity. ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 60, 94, 101. In August 2015, Dr. Saddler diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome. ECF No. 17-2 at 35; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 101. Plaintiff's diarrhea and other irritable bowel syndrome symptoms improved when she began to take Cymbalta for anxiety. ECF No. 17-2 at 35; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 60. In May 2016, however, Plaintiff reported that Cymbalta was no longer helping her depressive symptoms and asked to be prescribed a different medication. ECF No. 17-2 at 35; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 22. The ALJ found that, although Plaintiff complained of residual gastrointestinal [*24]  symptoms, they appeared to be improved with medication; further, the record did not "support the frequent irritable bowel syndrome flares that [she] allege[d]." ECF No. 17-2 at 35.
Moving on to Plaintiff's obesity, the ALJ found that it was "severe but not disabling," noting that although medical records documented slow movement and an unsteady gait in the months after the alleged onset date, since she began receiving treatment, "physical examinations have been quite unremarkable . . . and have not generally revealed significant difficulty moving about." Id. He then explained that he had limited her to light work with additional postural limitations based on her "symptoms of POTS, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, migraine, gastritis, . . . irritable bowel syndrome," and "chronic fatigue syndrome," finding a more restrictive RFC inappropriate in light of the medical record, which showed that "medication ha[d] been effective in reducing and ultimately controlling most symptoms and physical examinations he[d] generally not revealed significant abnormalities." Id. The ALJ noted Plaintiff's diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome and he found that her complaints of "brain fog" appeared to be side effects [*25]  of medication. Id. He asserted that changes in medication improved those symptoms, but nevertheless accounted for them (and for her chronic fatigue syndrome) by limiting her "to no production rate for pace of work." Id.; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 97, 110. As he did at step two of the sequential analysis, the ALJ found Plaintiff's claims at the hearing and in her function report of "significantly limited activities of daily living" not fully supported in light of her testimony that she could drive once per week, look at fashion websites and blogs, lunch with her cousin, use Facebook, make garments, and do some traveling while accompanied by her sister. ECF No. 17-2 at 35-36.

b. Records Relating to Mental Impairments
The ALJ then turned to Plaintiff's alleged mental impairments. Again, he found that her affective mood disorder and anxiety-related disorder could reasonably be expected to cause her symptoms of depression, panic attacks, and anxiety, but that the medical evidence did not support her allegations as to the severity of those symptoms. Id. at 36. The ALJ first evaluated the report of the consultative psychological examiner, Elizabeth Wangard, Psy.D., dated January 2014. Dr. Wangard [*26]  reported that Plaintiff was cooperative with appropriate dress, fair grooming, "somewhat lethargic" motor behavior, clear and fluent speech, coherent and goal-directed thought process, euthymic mood, appropriate affect, clear sensorium, average cognitive functioning, fair insight, good judgment, and good attention and concentration. Id.; see also ECF No. 17-10 at 19-20. Although initially tense and cautious, Plaintiff relaxed after a short time. ECF No. 17-2 at 36; see also ECF No. 17-10 at 20. Dr. Mohamad Houry, Plaintiff's primary care physician, reported that medication—citalopram—seemed to be helping Plaintiff's anxiety in early 2014 and reported that she was "doing great" in March 2015. ECF No. 17-2 at 36; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 9; ECF No. 17-11 at 9. Citalopram continued to control her symptoms through December 2015, but Plaintiff asked to be prescribed Cymbalta, instead. ECF No. 17-2 at 36; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 62. However, by May 2016, Plaintiff presented with intermittent tearfulness and slightly anxious affect, so she was transitioned off Cymbalta and onto Savella. ECF No. 17-2 at 36; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 24. The ALJ found that the treatment records showed Plaintiff's [*27]  affective mood disorder and anxiety-related disorder were controlled with medication. ECF No. 17-2 at 36. She had no history of treatment from a mental health specialist notwithstanding that neurologist Dr. Bayat recommended she seek psychiatric treatment in January 2014. Id.; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 33. Finally, the ALJ noted that Plaintiff reportedly drank five to ten alcoholic beverages per week in January 2013 and testified that she should not have been using alcohol in light of her psychiatric medication. ECF No. 17-2 at 36, 66. The ALJ recognized Plaintiff's "history of learning disability" but noted that no treating or examining source had "diagnosed a learning disability or dyslexia" since the alleged onset date. Id. at 36. Finally, he found that her treatment for obstructive sleep apnea was effective. Id. at 37.

c. Opinion Evidence
The ALJ next evaluated opinion evidence, specifically the decisions at the initial and reconsideration level from State agency consultants from February and April 2014, Dr. Wangard's January 2014 consultative psychological examination report, a March 2013 questionnaire from Dr. David, a May 2014 note from Dr. Houry, an April 2016 medical source statement [*28]  from Dr. Solomon, and a June 2016 medical source statement from Dr. Hashefi. He also considered a third-party function report from Plaintiff's sister dated November 5, 2013.
The ALJ gave the opinions of the State agency consultants partial weight as "only partially consistent with the medical evidence." Id. at 37. The ALJ found unconvincing the conclusion of the consultant at the initial level that Plaintiff was limited to standing or walking four hours out of an eight-hour day (which would limit her to sedentary work), agreeing with the consultant on reconsideration that her exertional limitations were consistent with light work. Id.; see also ECF No. 17-3 at 9, 21, 36, 50. He cited evidence that her physical impairments improved and are largely controlled with medication and that physical examinations were generally unremarkable. ECF No. 17-2 at 37. Ultimately, the ALJ agreed with most of the postural and environmental limitations recommended by the State agency consultants (never climbing ladders, ropes, or scaffolds); occasionally stooping kneeling, crouching, crawling; avoiding hazards), but imposed some more restrictive limitations, finding that Plaintiff could only occasionally [*29]  (rather than frequently) climb ramps and stairs and balance and that she should avoid concentrated exposure not only to hazards, but also to extreme heat and cold. Id. at 31, 37; see also ECF No. 17-3 at 9-10, 21-22, 36-37, 50-51. The ALJ agreed with the consultants' conclusions at both the initial level and on reconsideration that Plaintiff did not have a severe mental impairment, pointing out that the conclusion was consistent with treatment records evidencing "medication effectiveness and . . . generally unremarkable examinations except for some lethargy, anxiety, and tearfulness at times." ECF No. 17-2 at 31, 37; see also ECF No. 17-3 at 7, 19, 34, 48. However, Plaintiff's chronic fatigue syndrome and reports of medication side effects supported a "limitation to no production rate for pace of work." ECF No. 17-2 at 37.
Consistent with the above interpretation of the medical evidence—that is, medication effectiveness, generally unremarkable examinations, chronic fatigue syndrome, and complaints of brain fog—the ALJ also found partially consistent with the medical evidence Dr. Wangard's opinion that Plaintiff had a mild limitation in her ability to maintain a regular schedule and [*30]  appropriately deal with stress but had no limitation in her ability to perform simple and complex tasks, maintain attention and concentration, learn new tasks, make appropriate decisions, or relate adequately with others. Id.; see also ECF No. 17-10 at 22-23. Rather, he found that Plaintiff's only limitation due to mental impairments was that she should have "no production rate for pace of work." ECF No. 17-2 at 37.
The ALJ partially discounted Dr. David's March 2013 note stating that Plaintiff could not make decisions and was a fall risk, pointing out that, while Plaintiff was observed to have an unsteady gait and slow movement in January 2013, she began taking midodrine in April 2013 and then Florinef in November 2013, resulting in improvement in her symptoms. Id. at 37-38; see also ECF No. 17-6 at 58. He also noted that Dr. Wangard had observed that Plaintiff had good judgment and that Plaintiff testified that she could drive. ECF No. 17-2 at 38; see also ECF No. 17-10 at 19. The ALJ gave little weight to Dr. Houry's May 2014 note that Plaintiff was a candidate for a disability plan, finding it inconsistent with Dr. Houry's notes from an examination that same month that, although [*31]  revealing flexible joints and five of nine Breighton criteria, found normal range of motion, no synovitis, and no neurological abnormalities other than slightly decreased strength in her shoulder girdle.25
Dr. Solomon's medical source statement of April 2016 noted that he had seen her four times between November 2013 and November 2105 (her then most recent visit) and enumerated Plaintiff's symptoms as "progressive fatigue + lightheadedness + dizziness," occasional insomnia, and a propensity for labile blood pressure. ECF No. 17-11 at 89. He further reported that a tilt table test of December 2013 noted tachycardia during the procedure although Plaintiff was on medication at the time.26 Id. Relying on Plaintiff's self-report, Dr. Solomon opined that she could sit and stand/walk for fewer than two hours of an eight-hour workday, could sit upright for six hours if she elevated her legs after twenty minutes, would have to lie down during the workday if she "develop[ed] symptoms," and experienced intermittent headaches, insomnia, and elevated blood pressure as side effects from medication. Id. at 89-91. Dr. Solomon further asserted that Plaintiff would not need rest periods [*32]  in addition to the standard number and duration (two fifteen-minute and one thirty-minute breaks) that he could not predict how often her impairments would cause her to be absent from work, and that her "disability/diagnosis" was unlikely to change over time. Id. at 92. The ALJ gave this opinion little weight, noting that (1) Dr. Solomon had seen the claimant only four times since November, (2) he based his opinion on Plaintiff's self-report rather than objective medical findings, and (3) the statement was inconsistent with the treatment note from Plaintiff's most recent visit (in November 2015), which found that her symptoms had "dramatically improved" with an increase in her Florinef dosage, she had systolic blood pressure in the normal range, had no edema, and was "doing very well from a cardiac standpoint," although she complained of intermittent headaches and insomnia. ECF No. 17-2 at 38; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 66-67.
The ALJ also gave little weight to Dr. Hashefi's June 2016 medical source statement, which opined that Plaintiff's diagnosed impairments—listed as Ehlers Danlos syndrome, POTS, undifferentiated connective tissue disease with features [*33]  of mixed connective tissue disease, and fibromyalgia—imposed significant limitations in sitting (fewer than two hours per eight-hour workday and only fifteen minutes per hour) and standing and walking (fewer than two hours in an eight-hour workday); required her to lie down with her legs elevated when her blood pressure dropped; and prevented her from traveling alone in case of cognitive impairment and nausea/vomiting/dizziness. ECF No. 17-13 at 2-3. Dr. Hashefi also stated that Plaintiff was incapable of even a low-stress job; could not use her feet for pushing and pulling of leg controls; could occasionally handle, finger, and push/pull hand controls; could less than occasionally reach; was capable of only occasionally lifting and carrying less than five pounds in weight; could occasionally turn her head from side to side and up and down; would be absent form work more than three times per month, and required multiple workday rest periods of 30 to 45 minutes each. Id. at 3-5. The ALJ found those limitations "not consistent with the bulk of the medical record," which showed "unremarkable" neurological and musculoskeletal examinations "except for 5/9 Beighton criteria" and such improvement [*34]  with medication that Dr. Hashefi noted in February 2015 that Plaintiff's weakness was "almost resolved." ECF No. 17-2 at 38; see also, e.g., ECF No. 17-11 at 105. Likewise, her POTS, migraine, gastritis, and irritable bowel syndrome symptoms had improved with medication as reflected in Plaintiff's reports to her treating sources and those sources' treatment notes. ECF No. 17-2 at 38. The ALJ recognized that Plaintiff's chronic fatigue syndrome and medication side effects "limit her ability to produce production rate work," but found that the record "[did] not support any mental limitations," noting that, "with treatment, [Plaintiff's] cognition has been intact on examination." Id.
Finally, the ALJ considered Plaintiff's sister's third-party function report of November 2013, giving it little weight.27 Id. at 37. He reasoned that the report, which claimed, among other things, that Plaintiff's impairments "affect[ed] her ability to talk, use her hands, and get along with others" was inconsistent with the medical records, which do not reflect such difficulties. Id.; see generally ECF No. 20-2. Nor was the report consistent with Plaintiff's own reports of her activities, he said, "such as [*35]  sewing and using a computer, which require use of the hands, as well as socializing with family." ECF No. 17-2 at 37.
Wrapping up, the ALJ recapitulated that, having considered all of Plaintiff's complaints—"including blood pressure fluctuations, dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, pain, weakness, fatigue, and medication side effects"—the record evidence supported a conclusion that Plaintiff had the RFC to perform light work with occasional postural maneuvers; no climbing of ropes, ladders, or scaffolds; no concentrated exposure to extreme heat, extreme cold, or hazards such as moving machinery and unprotected heights; and no production rate requirements. Id. at 39. He further found that the record failed to support any additional limitations, including leg elevation, excessive time off task, or excessive absences. Id.
3. Conclusion of the Five-Step Sequential Inquiry
The ALJ found that Plaintiff had past relevant work as a retail sales associate. ECF No. 17-2 at 39. Relying on the testimony of the vocational expert, he further found that Plaintiff had the residual functional capacity to perform that past work. Id.
The ALJ continued to make "alternative findings" that there were [*36]  also other jobs in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform. Id. Noting that Plaintiff could not perform the entire range of light work and additionally had non-exertional limitations, he did not rely on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines of Social Security regulations. Id. at 39-40. Rather, he again relied on the testimony of the vocational expert to find that Plaintiff could also perform the jobs of table worker, machine tender, and general office helper, and that these jobs would still be available if, in addition to the RFC found, Plaintiff had to alternate between sitting and standing every 30 minutes. Id. at 40. He therefore found that Plaintiff had not been under a disability from December 9, 2012 (the date of onset) through August 10, 2016 (the date of the ALJ's decision).28 Id. at 41.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
A federal district court has jurisdiction over a civil case challenging a final decision of the Commissioner. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). A reviewing court must affirm the Commissioner's decision if it is based on substantial evidence in the record and the correct application of the relevant legal standards. Id.; Butler, 353 F.3d at 999.
"[T]he plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the Commissioner's decision [*37]  is not based on substantial evidence or that incorrect legal standards were applied." Lane-Rauth v. Barnhart, 437 F. Supp. 2d 63, 64 (D.D.C. 2006). Substantial evidence is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S. Ct. 1420, 28 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1971) (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S. Ct. 206, 83 L. Ed. 126 (1938)). It requires "more than a scintilla [of evidence], but can be satisfied by something less than a preponderance of the evidence." Fla. Mun. Power Agency v. FERC, 315 F.3d 362, 365-66, 354 U.S. App. D.C. 281 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting FPL Energy Me. Hydro LLC v. FERC, 287 F.3d 1151, 1160, 351 U.S. App. D.C. 148 (D.C. Cir. 2002)). Ultimately, the substantial evidence standard is a "low bar," La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FERC, 20 F.4th 1, 7, 455 U.S. App. D.C. 40 (D.C. Cir. 2021), and "requires considerable deference to the decision rendered by the ALJ," Crosson v. Shalala, 907 F. Supp. 1, 3 (D.D.C. 1995); see also Biestek v. Berryhill,     U.S.    ,    , 139 S. Ct. 1148, 1154, 203 L. Ed. 2d 504 (2019) ("[W]hatever the meaning of 'substantial' in other contexts, the threshold for such evidentiary sufficiency [under the substantial evidence standard] is not high."). The reviewing court may neither reweigh the evidence presented to it nor replace the Commissioner's judgment "concerning the credibility of the evidence with its own." Crosson, 907 F. Supp. at 3; see also Butler, 353 F.3d at 999 (finding that the district court's role is not to reweigh the evidence but only to determine whether the ALJ's findings are "based on substantial evidence and a correct application of the law"). However, "this standard of review requires the Court to carefully scrutinize the entire record to ensure that the Commissioner, through the ALJ, has [*38]  both analyzed all of the evidence available and has sufficiently explained his/her reasoning and the weights given to the facts." Pinkney v. Astrue, 675 F. Supp. 2d 9, 14 (D.D.C. 2009); see also Lane-Rauth, 437 F. Supp. 2d at 65 ("[T]his standard of review 'calls for careful scrutiny of the entire record,' to determine whether the Commissioner, acting through the ALJ, 'has analyzed all evidence and has sufficiently explained the weight he has given to obviously probative exhibits[.]'" (second alteration in original) (quoting Butler, 353 F.3d at 999)). In applying this standard, courts "must also be mindful of the harmless-error rule. Consequently, even if [the court] perceive[s] error," it must "affirm the Commissioner's decision unless the error is prejudicial." Saunders v. Kijakazi, 6 F.4th 1, 4, 453 U.S. App. D.C. 360 (D.C. Cir. 2021).
Finally, the Court's job is to "consider the grounds actually proffered by the ALJ" rather than to make those determinations for itself, Ward v. Berryhill, 246 F. Supp. 3d 202, 210 (D.D.C. 2017), or credit "post-hoc rationalization[s]" advanced by the parties, Cooper v. Berryhill, No. 16-cv-1671, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159807, 2017 WL 4326388, at *5 (D.D.C. Sept. 28, 2017); see also SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S. Ct. 1575, 91 L. Ed. 1995 (1947) (holding that a reviewing court "must judge the propriety of [an agency's judgment] solely by the grounds invoked by the agency"); Jones v. Astrue, 647 F.3d 350, 356, 396 U.S. App. D.C. 235 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing Chenery, 332 U.S. at 196).

III. DISCUSSION
According to Plaintiff's opening brief, the ALJ erred in the following nine ways:
(1) He omitted evidence inconsistent with his conclusions, including evidence of [*39]  several additional impairments;
(2) He erroneously found that Plaintiff did not meet the requirements of Listings 4.05 and 14.06;
(3) He ignored favorable portions of the State agency consultants' opinions suggesting specific accommodations;
(4) He rejected uncontroverted proof that Plaintiff was disabled from December 9, 2012, through the end of 2013;
(5) He improperly extrapolated isolated medical evidence of normal exams and improvement to the entire period at issue;
(6) He improperly required objective medical evidence to corroborate Plaintiff's symptoms;
(7) He failed to give controlling weight to the opinions of treating physicians Dr. David, Dr. Solomon, and Dr. Hashefi;
(8) He failed to build a logical bridge between the evidence and his assessment of Plaintiff's RFC, including by failing to assess the impact of her impairments in combination;
(9) He provided the vocational expert with hypotheticals that improperly relied on unsupported portions of the State agency consultants' reports.
ECF No 20-1 at 2-3. Although there is significant overlap among these categories, in the service of thoroughness and transparency the undersigned addresses each in turn.
The discussion below is guided by two overarching [*40]  principles related to the standard discussed above in Section II. First, the Commissioner's findings must be upheld if they are "'supported by substantial evidence' and 'not tainted by an error of law.'" Ali v. Colvin, 236 F. Supp. 3d 86, 90 (D.D.C. 2017) (quoting Porter v. Colvin, 951 F. Supp. 2d 125, 129 (D.D.C. 2013)). That is, "[i]f supported by substantial evidence, the Commissioner's finding[s] must be sustained 'even where substantial evidence may support the plaintiff's position and despite that the court's independent analysis of the evidence may differ from the [Commissioner's].'" Id. (final alteration in original) (quoting Rosado v. Sullivan, 805 F. Supp. 147, 153 (S.D.N.Y. 1992)); see also Morales v. Berryhill, 484 F. Supp. 3d 130, 140 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) ("Even where the administrative record may also adequately support contrary findings on particular issues, the ALJ's factual findings must be given conclusive effect so long as they are supported by substantial evidence." (quoting Genier v. Astrue, 606 F.3d 46, 49 (2d Cir. 2010))); Kober v. Apfel, 133 F. Supp. 2d 868, 873 (W.D. Va. 2001) ("The Commissioner's decision, 'if supported by substantial evidence, must be affirmed even though the reviewing court believes that substantial evidence also supports a contrary result.'" (quoting Estep v. Richardson, 459 F.2d 1015, 1017 (4th Cir. 1972))). Second, the plaintiff in an appeal of a decision denying benefits has the burden to "clearly identify the error[s] and explain how the error[s] actually 'affect[ed] [her] "substantial rights."'" Holloman v. Comm'r Soc. Sec., 639 F. App'x 810, 814 n.3 (3d Cir. 2016) (third alteration [*41]  in original) (quoting Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 407, 129 S. Ct. 1696, 173 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2009)); Ludwig v. Astrue, 681 F.3d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir. 2012) ("The burden is on the party claiming error to demonstrate not only the error, but also that it affected his 'substantial rights,' which is to say, not merely his procedural rights."). Thus, it is not enough to merely identify an error in the ALJ's opinion; the plaintiff must also demonstrate how that error "could have made any difference" to the decision denying benefits. Holloman, 639 F. App'x at 814 (quoting Shinseki, 556 U.S. at 413); see also, e.g., Bales v. Colvin, 576 F. App'x 792, 797 (10th Cir. 2014) (holding that, where the plaintiff failed to explain how evidence allegedly ignored by the ALJ "ha[d] any bearing on her functional limitations," she "ha[d] not established error in the ALJ's failure to discuss" those findings); Owings v. Colvin, 133 F. Supp. 3d 985, 998 (M.D. Tenn. 2015) (requiring the plaintiff to show that, had the ALJ not erred, the case "would have resulted in a different outcome"). With those precepts in mind, the undersigned turns to Plaintiff's arguments.

A. Failure to Discuss Evidence
At the outset, the undersigned must correct a misstatement of the law that underlies Plaintiff's arguments in this section of her brief. She contends that the ALJ "did not satisfy his affirmative duty to develop the case on both sides, setting forth all relevant evidence that supported her." ECF No. 20-1 at 27 (emphasis [*42]  added). There is no such requirement. To be sure, "because of 'the nature of Social Security disability proceedings which are inquisitorial rather than adversarial and in which [i]t is the ALJ's duty to investigate the facts and develop the arguments both for and against granting benefits.'" Holloman, 639 F. App'x at 814 n.3 (alteration in original) (quoting Burnett v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 220 F.3d 112, 120 n. 2 (3d Cir.2000)); see also Krishnan v. Barnhart, 328 F.3d 685, 695, 356 U.S. App. D.C. 147 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (similar). But the ALJ need not "set[ ] forth all relevant evidence support[ing]" a claim of disability. Rather, it is well-established that "there is 'no rigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision.'" Goodman v. Colvin, 233 F. Supp. 3d 88, 109 (D.D.C. 2017) (quoting Reid v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 769 F.3d 861, 865 (4th Cir. 2014)). Instead, the ALJ must only "minimally discuss a claimant's evidence that contradicts the Commissioner's position." Lane-Rauth, 437 F. Supp. 2d at 67 (quoting Godbey v. Apfel, 238 F.3d 803, 808 (7th Cir. 2000)). That is, an ALJ "is only prohibited 'from ignoring an entire line of evidence that supports a disability finding.'" Goodman, 233 F. Supp. 3d at 109 (quoting Jones v. Astrue, 623 F.3d 1155, 1162 (7th Cir. 2013)). Remand will be warranted where an ALJ's discussion of contrary evidence is so sparse as to frustrate review. See, e.g., Fay v. Massanari, No. 00 C 7399, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9198, 2001 WL 755135, at *7 (N.D. Ill. July 2, 2001) ("It is worth repeating that 'an ALJ may not ignore an entire line of evidence that is contrary to her findings,' rather she must 'articulate at some minimum level [her] analysis of the evidence' to permit an informed [*43]  review." (alteration in original) (internal citations omitted) (first quoting Henderson v. Apfel, 179 F.3d 507, 514 (7th Cir. 1999), then quoting Clifford v. Apfel, 227 F.3d 863, 872 (7th Cir. 2000))); see also Cobb v. Astrue, 770 F. Supp. 2d 165, 173 (D.D.C. 2011) ("The ALJ's reasoning is not simply 'spare' . . . it is missing. . . . The judiciary can scarcely perform its assigned review function, limited though it is, without some indication not only of what evidence was credited, but also whether other evidence was rejected rather than simply ignored." (alterations in original) (quoting Butler, 353 F.3d at 1002)). Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff seeks reversal or remand because the ALJ did not set forth "all evidence" that might support a finding of disability, the argument is rejected out of hand.
More specifically, Plaintiff charges the ALJ with "omit[ing] a number of [Plaintiff's] medically determinable impairments, including connective tissue disease with muscle pain (myositis), Raynaud's syndrome, inflammatory arthropathy, and thyroid disease," and with "improperly reject[ing] her medically documented, complex learning disorders." ECF No. 20-1 at 28. According to Plaintiff, those impairments "significantly affected [her] functioning, and had to be considered." Id. There are a number of problems with this argument. First, the ALJ explicitly considered [*44]  Plaintiff's learning disorder—dyslexia—but found that "since the alleged onset date no treating or examining source ha[d] diagnosed a learning disability or dyslexia." ECF No. 17-2 at 36. The fairest reading of that statement in context is that there was no medical evidence in the record before the ALJ that Plaintiff had sought or received treatment or therapy for a learning disability since December 9, 2012—and Plaintiff points to no such evidence. Instead, she argues that learning disabilities cannot be cured. ECF No. 20-1 at 28 n.14. But that does not change the fact that, notwithstanding Plaintiff's bare assertion that dyslexia "significantly affected [her] functioning," she offers no support from the record that it caused functional limitations during the period at issue. See, e.g., Bales, 576 F. App'x at 797 ("[A] medical condition need not be considered where the claimant has failed to identify resulting functional limitations that would affect the ALJ's analysis." (citing Burch v. Barnhart, 400 F.3d 676, 683 (9th Cir. 2005)).
As to connective tissue disease with muscle pain, Raynaud's syndrome,29 and inflammatory arthropathy, the ALJ also considered those impairments and/or symptoms. As noted above, see supra note 14, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is itself a [*45]  connective tissue disease, which the ALJ clearly recognized, as he evaluated it under the rubric of Listing 14.06 for "[u]ndifferentiated and mixed connective tissue disease." 20 C.F.R. Part 404, subpart P, app. 1, Listing 14.06 (2016); see generally Simpson v. Saul, No. 18-cv-747, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148881, 2019 WL 4141057 (M.D.N.C. Aug. 30, 2019) (remanding for the ALJ to consider the plaintiff's Ehlers-Danlos syndrome under Listing 14.06). The specific treatment record to which Plaintiff points for the diagnoses of Raynaud's syndrome and inflammatory arthropathy notes that those ailments are related to Plaintiff's connective tissue disease. See ECF No. 17-11 at 135 (assessing undifferentiated connective tissue disease "with features of . . . Raynaud's and inflammatory arthropathy"); ECF No. 20-1 at 20. Indeed, Plaintiff herself asserts that Raynaud's phenomenon is a symptom of mixed connective tissue disorder. ECF No. 20-1 at 13 n.5. Thus, the ALJ's consideration of Plaintiff's Ehlers-Danlos syndrome sufficiently accounted for those other conditions, even if they were not explicitly mentioned. See Owings, 133 F. Supp. 3d at 999 (noting that where alleged symptoms or limitations are "related to" an impairment that has been addressed by the ALJ, "further analysis is not required"). More, Plaintiff again fails to "identify . . . functional limitations [resulting from those symptoms [*46]  or conditions] that would affect the ALJ's analysis."30 Bales, 576 F. App'x at 797. The same is true of Plaintiff's alleged thyroid disease. Plaintiff points to a single treatment record from February 2014 that reflects thyroid problems (a notation that Plaintiff's active problems included "[g]oiter diffuse"). ECF No. 17-11 at 135; see also ECF No. 20-1 at 20. She offers nothing to connect thyroid issues with any functional limitations. Nor does the report cited above indicate that Plaintiff had such limitations or even sought treatment for thyroid disease.31 ECF No. 17-11 at 134-138 (seeking treatment for connective tissue disease, generalized pain, and tingling sensations). Plaintiff has therefore "not established error in the ALJ's [alleged] failure to discuss" these impairments. Bales, 576 F. App'x at 797.
Next, Plaintiff offers a litany of evidence that the ALJ allegedly ignored:
(1) Tilt table testing and "72-hour EEG monitoring,"32 which Plaintiff asserts established that she met Listing 4.05 for recurrent arrhythmias;
(2) Repeated complaints of "not feeling well" that allegedly established that she met Listing 14.06 for connective tissue disease;
(3) Evidence from December 9, 2012, through December 2013, including Plaintiff's [*47]  function report in November 2013 and Plaintiff's sister's third-party function report that same month, which assertedly established her disability for that period of time;
(4) Accommodations listed in the State agency consultants' reports that would preclude work in the national economy;
(5) The opinions of treating physicians Dr. Solomon and Dr. Hashefi that established disability;
(6) Evidence showing that the State agency consultants did not take Plaintiff's subjective complaints into account;
(7) Treatment notes showing that Plaintiff needed to lie down frequently and that her migraine frequency would preclude full-time employment;
(8) Evidence of Plaintiff's connective tissue disorder with joint and muscle pain;
(9) Evidence of a fifteen point drop in her IQ between 1997 and 2014;
(10) Evidence that Plaintiff's "medical improvement did not render her capable of sustaining full time employment and was not sustained"; and
(11) Evidence that Plaintiff required a home health aide in June 2016.
ECF No. 20-1 at 29. Most of these complaints mirror the alleged errors to which Plaintiff devotes a subsection of her brief (listed above in the first paragraph of this "Discussion" section. For example, [*48]  Plaintiff argues later in her opening submission that tilt-table testing and extended EEG monitoring (or perhaps ECG monitoring, see supra note 32) established that she met Listing 4.05, see ECF No. 20-1 at 30-31; that her complaints of "ongoing malaise," or "not feeling well," established that she met Listing 14.06, see id.; that she had established disability for the period from December 2012 to December 2013, see id. at 33-35; that the accommodations listed in the State agency consultants' reports established disability, see id. at 31-33; that the ALJ erroneously failed to give the opinions of Drs. Solomon and Hashefi controlling weight, see id. at 43-48; that the ALJ was precluded from relying on portions of the State agency consultants' reports because they failed to take into account her subjective complaints, see id. at 34 n.17; and that the ALJ improperly characterized Plaintiff's improvement as sustained, see id. at 37-38. Those issues will be addressed in greater detail later.
To the extent that Plaintiff contends that the ALJ's alleged failure to note such evidence in [*49]  his opinion alone merits remand, the argument fails. Recall that an ALJ need only "minimally discuss" evidence contradicting his findings. Lane-Rauth, 437 F. Supp. 2d at 67. Remand will be warranted where an ALJ disregards an entire line of evidence supporting a disability finding such that the court cannot perform its limited review function. See, e.g., Cobb, 770 F. Supp. 2d at 173. Such "minimal[]" discussion is not an onerous standard and here it is met.
Take, for example, Plaintiff's complaint that the ALJ did not mention the results from extended ECG monitoring in November 2013,33 "in which one can see her tachycardia on the monitor strips, especially when she stood up," ECF No. 20-1 at 17 (citation to the record omitted); and from her tilt table test, which Dr. Solomon's medical source statement reported showed an increased heart rate after eleven minutes, id. at 21; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 89. But the ALJ did not ignore evidence of Plaintiff's tachycardia. To the contrary, he noted in his opinion that at an examination by a cardiologist in April 2013, "revealed marked increase in [heart] rate from supine to standing, meeting criteria for POTS." ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 59. He further noted Plaintiff's continued complaints [*50]  of dizziness later that year to Dr. Solomon. See ECF No. 17-2 at 33. More, Dr. Solomon's medical source statement reported some tachycardia during the tilt table test. ECF No. 17-11 at 89. The ALJ addressed and rejected Dr. Solomon's opinion as not consistent with the medical evidence. ECF No. 17-2 at 38. Additionally, it would have been error for the ALJ to himself interpret the raw medical data—what Plaintiff calls the "monitor strips"—from the November 2013 ECG monitoring, as "ALJs are not qualified to interpret raw medical data[.]" Dillman v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 990 F. Supp. 2d 787, 795 (S.D. Ohio 2013); see also Manso-Pizarro v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 76 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1996) ("With a few exceptions (not relevant here), an ALJ, as a lay person, is not qualified to interpret raw data in a medical record."); Burke v. Berryhill, No. 16-cv-485, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27849, 2018 WL 1000006, at *6 (S.D. Ohio Feb. 21, 2018) ("The ALJ is not a pulmonologist and is not qualified to interpret spirometry results."). Thus, the ALJ sufficiently discussed evidence of Plaintiff's tachycardia. Similarly, Plaintiff lists dozens of documents that purportedly evidence her repeated complaints of "not feeling well," apparently faulting the ALJ for not citing all of them. ECF No. 20-1 at 29; see also id. at 30-31. Far from disregarding these subjective reports, the ALJ's opinion noted Plaintiff's numerous complaints to her treating health professionals, [*51]  such as dizziness, fainting, migraines, generalized pain, stiffness, tingling, diarrhea, and nausea. See generally ECF No. 17-2 at 33-35.
Furthermore, the ALJ specifically cited many of the documents Plaintiff asserts he ignored. For example, contrary to Plaintiff's assertion that he disregarded the November 2013 function reports of Plaintiff and her sister, the ALJ specifically noted that Plaintiff's function report reflected "significantly limited activities of daily living," as well as "anger, frustration, . . . few social interactions," and memory, concentration, and attention problems. ECF No. 17-2 at 30; see also ECF No. 17-6 at 73-90. Likewise, he addressed Plaintiff's sister's third-party function report, just as he did Dr. Solomon's medical source statement, and Dr. Hashefi's medical source statement—two other records Plaintiff asserts were ignored. ECF No. 17-2 at 38; see also ECF No. 20-1 at 29. Indeed, rather than making a cogent argument that the ALJ ignored or missed "entire line[s] of evidence," Goodman, 233 F. Supp. 3d at 109, thus frustrating district court review, Plaintiff appears to take issue primarily with the ALJ's weighing of such evidence (an issue that will be discussed below).
 [*52] Other evidence she asserts was ignored does not seem to exist—or, at least, it is not identified in Plaintiff's briefs. For example, she appears to state that the ALJ disregarded "medical treatment notes . . . consistent with [her] testimony and her specialists' opinions regarding her need to lie down and elevate her feet frequently." ECF No. 20-1 at 29. But she points to no such treatment notes. Instead, she offers Plaintiff's own testimony, the opinions of Drs. Solomon and Hashefi (which, as noted above, the ALJ considered), and an internet source. See id. at 21 (citing Dr. Solomon's medical source statement), 22 (citing Plaintiff's testimony and Dr. Solomon's medical source statement), 36 (citing Plaintiff's testimony), 41 (citing a page from the POTS UK website), 45 (citing the medical source statements of Dr. Solomon and Dr. Hashefi). Ultimately, she hypothesizes that it is "entirely credible that both of [Plaintiff's] treating specialists would tell her to lie down and elevate her legs for blood pooling" id. at 41, and pleads for "a dose of commonsense," id. at 45 n.29. None of that comprises disregarded "treatment notes" recommending that Plaintiff lie down and elevate her legs frequently, and the undersigned will not scour the record to find evidence Plaintiff has failed to identify. See, e.g., Velasquez v. Astrue, 301 F. App'x 778, 780 (10th Cir. 2008) ("[T]he court cannot take on the responsibility of serving as the litigant's attorney in constructing arguments and searching the record." (quoting Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux & Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005))); D.J. v. Kijakazi, No. 21-cv-2864, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94065, 2022 WL 1663120, at *3 n.3 (D. Colo. May 25, 2022) ("[A] party's failure to point the court to evidence in the record which supports its motion creates no duty in the court to make that party's case for it." (alteration in original) (quoting Corral v. Colvin, No. 14-cv-3028, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39389, 2016 WL 1170216, at *2 (D. Colo. Mar. 25, 2016))); Charles A. v. Saul, No. 20-cv-412, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126235, 2021 WL 2820534, at *2 (S.D. Ind. July 7, 2021) ("It is not for this Court to develop the [p]laintiff's arguments or comb through the record to find support." (quoting Collins v.

LEXIS 200640, 2020 WL 6305549, at *11 (D.N.J. Oct. 28, 2020) ("Lacking any direction from [Plaintiff] as to the specific [evidence] at issue, we will not scour the record to attempt to discern [her] position.") (second alteration in original) (quoting Atkins v. Comm'r Soc. Sec., 810 Fed. App'x. 122, 129 (3d Cir. 2020))).
Last, it bears noting that for much of the evidence Plaintiff asserts was ignored, she fails to explain how considering it would have affected the five-step sequential inquiry. For example, she makes much of I.Q. testing that showed a "15+ point drop" between 1997 and 2014, compare ECF No. 17-10 at 73 with id. at 20, even citing the organic brain disorders Listing for which one of the markers can be "[l]oss of measured intellectual ability of at least 15 I.Q. points from premorbid levels." ECF No. 20-1 at 19; see also 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, Listing 12.02. But she makes no argument that she would otherwise meet that Listing by showing that she has [*53]  two of the four "Paragraph B" criteria—marked restriction in activities of daily living; marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning; marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace; or repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration. See, e.g., Holloman, 639 F. App'x at 814 (finding "no basis" to remand the case where the plaintiff failed to explain "how [he] might have prevailed at step three if the ALJ's analysis had been more thorough"); Koon-Branch, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 200640, 2020 WL 6305549, at *9 ("Plaintiff has not explained . . . how crediting this [I.Q.] score establishes that she meets the B or C criteria of Listing 12.02 or would otherwise lead to a different result."). Nor does Plaintiff specify how the fact that she was prescribed a home health aide in June 2016—apparently because of side effects due to changes to her anti-depressant medication, see ECF No. 17-12 at 134—would lead to a different result.
In short, Plaintiff has not shown that remand is required because the ALJ ignored favorable evidence.

B. The Listings
As noted, Plaintiff asserts that the ALJ erroneously found that she failed to meet Listing 4.05 for recurrent arrhythmias and Listing 14.06 for mixed connective tissue disorders. Neither argument succeeds.
1. Listing 4.05
A plaintiff meets Listing 4.05 where recurrent [*54]  arrhythmias not related to reversible causes result in (and in the following quotation, italicized words are further defined in the regulations) "uncontrolled, recurrent episodes of cardiac syncope or near syncope, despite prescribed treatment, and documented by resting or ambulatory (Holter) electrocardiography, or by other appropriate medically acceptable testing, coincident with the occurrence of syncope or near syncope." 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, Listing 4.05 (2016) (internal citations omitted).34 "Uncontrolled means the impairment does not adequately respond to standard prescribed medical treatment, id., Listing 4.00A3f; "[r]ecurrent means that the longitudinal clinical record shows that, within a consecutive 12-month period, the finding(s) occurs at least three times, with intervening periods of improvement of sufficient duration that it is clear that separate events are involved," id., Listing 4.00A3c; "syncope is a loss of consciousness or a faint," id., Listing 4.00F3b; "near syncope" is "not merely a feeling of light-headedness, momentary weakness, or dizziness," but rather a "period of altered consciousness," id.; and to be "coincident," there must be an "association between the syncope or near syncope and the recurrent arrhythmia" documented by diagnostic [*55]  methods such as ambulatory electrocardiography or "tilt-table testing with a concurrent ECG," id., Listing 4.00F3c. Thus, a more condensed (but complete) restatement of the requirements of Listing 4.05 is as follows: arrhythmias not related to reversible causes that accepted diagnostic methods establish are associated with at least three separate episodes of fainting or an altered state of consciousness occurring within a year in spite of adherence to standard prescribed medical treatment.35
Plaintiff asserts that her tilt-table testing and extended EEG monitoring establish that she met Listing 4.05, but her explanation is both scant and confused. She states that she "met Listing 4.05 with recurrent tachycardia documented by syncope or near syncope on EEG monitoring" but then cites a monitor strip from ECG monitoring. ECF No. 20-1 at 30 (citing ECF No. 17-10 at 5). She then states that "[t]he ALJ failed to set forth probative evidence that disproved . . . his conclusions: her tilt table testing [and] 72-hour EEG monitoring." Id. That is the extent of the argument in her opening brief. Even when coupled with references to tilt-table testing and EEG (or ECG) monitoring scattered throughout that brief, there is no discernable coherent argument [*56]  that any testing showed that Plaintiff met the requirements of Listing 4.05. See id. at 14 ("In April 2013, hours of ambulatory EEG monitoring documented objective muscle artifact accompanying reported feelings of shakiness, inability to focus or concentrate, confusion, word finding difficulties, lethargy, nausea, and visual disturbances."), 17 ("She also had a 72-hour ambulatory EEG on November 28, 2013, in which one can see her tachycardia on the monitor strips, especially when she stood up." (internal citations to the record omitted)), 18 ("[T]ilt table testing and 72-hours EEG monitoring . . . provided clinical evidence of [Plaintiff's] low blood pressure, inability to stand for 11 minutes, and tachycardia with while standing and at rest."), 18-19 ("At her tilt table testing, her dizziness and nausea[] had been brought under control by midodrine."), 21 ("[Dr. Solomon] stated that she demonstrated tachycardia after 11 minutes of tilt table testing."), 29 ("[T]he tilt table testing and her 72-hour EEG monitoring . . . established [Plaintiff's] tachycardia standing and at rest, near syncope with movement, and dizziness[.]"). Her reply brief is no more helpful, finding episodes of near syncope [*57]  even where the medical records specifically state that near syncope did not occur, compare ECF No. 27 at 27 (stating that Plaintiff experienced near syncope at the tilt-table test) with ECF No. 17-9 at 35 (stating in a medical record that there was neither syncope nor near-syncope during the tilt-table test), and, even so, identifying only two rather than three such episodes.
Plaintiff's failure is unsurprising. Recall that the ALJ found that the medical record did not reflect "recurrent episodes of cardiac syncope or near syncope despite prescribed treatment, as required by the Listing. ECF No. 17-2 at 31. Assuming that Plaintiff means to argue that April 2013 EEG testing, November 2013 ECG testing, and December 2013 tilt-table testing establish those requirements, she fails. Plaintiff's April 2013 EEG testing was "within normal limits" and "remarkable" only for the many times Plaintiff informed the monitor of "variable psychosensory events" when there were "no significant changes in the EEG." ECF No. 17-10 at 12-13 (emphasis added). That is, there was no clinical evidence of syncope or near syncope. ECF No. 17-9 at 152. Dr. Solomon characterized the November 2013 ECG as "demonstrat[ing] [*58]  one short burst of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (seven beats) but . . . [being] otherwise unremarkable."36 ECF No. 17-9 at 35. The December 2013 tilt-table testing showed that Plaintiff "did not experience . . . syncope or near syncope" during the test. Id.; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 17. Thus, the ALJ's conclusion is correct and supported by the record: these studies do not establish that she meets Listing 4.05 because there is no clinical evidence of arrhythmias that caused at least three separate episodes of fainting or an altered state of consciousness occurring within a year. Thus, Plaintiff has not demonstrated error, let alone error that affected her substantial rights, because the evidence she points to does not establish that she met the requirements of Listing 4.05. See, e.g., Smith-Johnson v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 579 F. App'x 426, 432-33 (6th Cir. 2014) (noting that to show error at step three, a plaintiff "must point to specific evidence that demonstrates [she] reasonably could meet or equal every requirement of the listing"); Josiah T. v. Comm'r, Soc. Sec. Admin., No. 20-cv-3572, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40666, 2022 WL 684944, at *2 (D. Md. Mar. 8, 2022) (stating that "[t]he plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that his impairment meets or medically equals a listed impairment" and finding no reversible error where the plaintiff pointed to evidence that could indicate he met one of the [*59]  requirements of a particular Listing but "fail[ed] to assert evidence that he [met] the other requirements"); Henson v. Kijakazi, No. 20-cv-204, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 239525, 2021 WL 5830595, at *3 (N.D. Miss. Dec. 8, 2021) (finding harmless error at step three where the plaintiff failed to show that he met all of the required elements of a Listing); Courtney v. Berryhill, 385 F. Supp. 3d 761, 766-67 (W.D. Wis. 2018) (similar); Doddy v. Comm'r, Soc. Sec. Admin., No. 2:12CV384, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40713, 2014 WL 1268567, at *5 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 27, 2014) (similar).
2. Listing 14.06
Under the regulations applicable on August 5, 2016, a person with a diagnosis of undifferentiated or mixed connective tissue disease could meet Listing 14.06 in two ways. She could show "[i]nvolvement of two or more body systems/organs," one of which was "involved to at least a moderate degree of severity," plus "[a]t least two of the constitutional symptoms or signs (severe fatigue, fever, malaise, or involuntary weight loss)." 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, Listing 14.06A. Alternatively, she could show "[r]epeated manifestations" of the disease with at least two of the aforementioned constitutional symptoms or signs, in addition to a marked limitation in activities of daily living, social functioning, or concentration, persistence or pace. Id., Listing 14.06B. Both parties appear to agree that Listing 14.06B is the one at issue here.  [*60] See ECF No. 25 at 18 (stating that the Listing at issue "requires that Plaintiff demonstrate a marked limitation in her activities of daily living, social functioning, or concentration, persistence or pace" and citing Listing 14.06B); ECF No. 27 at 16-17 (failing to counter the Commissioner's assertion that Plaintiff was required to show a marked limitation in one of those areas and arguing that she had a marked limitation in activities of daily functioning). The ALJ found that Plaintiff did not meet Listing 14.06 because, of the four constitutional symptoms or signs, the medical records documented only fatigue. ECF No. 17-2 at 31.
Plaintiff argues that she also established malaise, which is defined in the regulations as "frequent feelings of illness, bodily discomfort, or lack of well-being that result in significantly reduced physical activity or mental function." 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, Listing 14.00C2 (2016). In support, she cites numerous documents in the record that reflect her subjective complaints of pain, diarrhea, nausea, night sweats, weakness, dizziness, and the like. ECF No. 20-1 at 30-31. However, courts have affirmed an ALJ's determination that a claimant has not established conditions like malaise where there is of a lack of supporting [*61]  medical evidence in the record. See, e.g., Hands v. Colvin, No. 13-cv-363, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131092, 2015 WL 5730338, at *10-11 (N.D. Fla. Jan. 6, 2015) (finding no reversible error in the ALJ's determination that the claimant did not meet the requirements of Listings 14.03 and 14.06 where, although there were references to the plaintiff's "complaints of feeling tired or weak" in the record, the medical evidence did not reflect the requisite level of fatigue, fever, malaise, or involuntary weight loss), report and recommendation adopted, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131086, 2015 WL 5725805 (N.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 2015); see also Burch v. Saul, No. 20-cv-73, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112296, 2021 WL 2458772, at *5-6 (W.D. Ky. June 16, 2021) (finding that substantial evidence supported the ALJ's determination that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements of Listing 14.03 where medical records did not connect the claimant's malaise to her immune system disorder); Goodwin v. Astrue, No. 10-cv-1506, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97258, 2011 WL 3844156, at *14 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 30, 2011) (affirming the ALJ's decision that the claimant did not meet the requirements of Listing 14.09 where there was "no medical evidence indicating that [the plaintiff] experienced severe fatigue, fever, malaise, or involuntary weight loss"); cf. Dell v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., No. 16-cv-11308, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127091, 2017 WL 4925667, at *6 (E.D. Mich. June 12, 2017) (finding no error in the ALJ's rejection of a treating source's opinion that the plaintiff with an immune deficiency disorder suffered from, among other things, malaise, where there was no medical evidence to support it), report and recommendation adopted, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126600, 2017 WL 3431793 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 10, 2017).
Additionally, to show that an ALJ's decision that a plaintiff failed [*62]  to meet the requirements of a Listing is not harmless error, the plaintiff "must point to specific evidence that demonstrates [she] reasonably could meet or equal every requirement of the listing." Smith-Johnson, 579 F. App'x at 432-33; see also, e.g., Josiah T., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40666, 2022 WL 684944, at *2 (stating that "[t]he plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that his impairment meets or medically equals a listed impairment" and finding no reversible error where the plaintiff pointed to evidence that could indicate he met one of the requirements of a particular Listing but "fail[ed] to assert evidence that he [met] the other requirements"); Henson, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 239525, 2021 WL 5830595, at *3 (finding harmless error at step three where the plaintiff failed to show that he met all of the required elements of a Listing); Courtney, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 766-67 (similar); Doddy, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40713, 2014 WL 1268567, at *5 (similar). As the Commissioner points out, even if Plaintiff had shown error in the ALJ's finding regarding malaise, to meet Listing 14.06B, she would still have to point to evidence "demonstrat[ing] a marked limitation in her activities of daily living, social functioning, or concentration, persistence or pace." See ECF No. 25 at 18. In her opening brief, Plaintiff makes no attempt to do so. In her reply brief, she asserts that Plaintiff had marked limitations in activities of daily living.37 ECF No. [*63]  27 at 16. Again, an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief may be deemed forfeited. See, e.g., Am. Wildlands, 530 F.3d at 1001. Additionally, the ALJ explicitly found that Plaintiff did not have a marked limitation in activities of daily living. ECF No. 17-2 at 30. In doing so, the ALJ noted that Plaintiff described "significantly limited activities of daily living due primarily to her physical impairments." Id. He discounted those reports based on Plaintiff's own reports of her activities—driving, using the computer to peruse Facebook and looking at fashion websites and blogs, occasionally going out to lunch and traveling, and sewing38 —which suggested that her activities of daily living were not as circumscribed as she represented. Id. He later bolstered that finding when he addressed her complaints related to POTS, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, migraine, and digestive impairments—which included headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, and weakness (the very ailments she asserts are evidence of malaise)—and found that they were improved by medication as confirmed by her own reports to her treating doctors. Id. at 33-35. The ALJ's decision on this issue was supported by substantial evidence. See, e.g., Davis v. Saul, No. 18-cv-204, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114761, 2020 WL 3542232, at *4 (D.D.C. June 30, 2020) (noting [*64]  that the assessment of a claimant's subjective reports of her symptoms "'is solely within the realm of the ALJ' and is only to be disrupted when 'an ALJ fails to articulate a rational explanation for his or her finding'" (quoting Grant v. Astrue, 857 F. Supp. 2d 146, 156 (D.D.C. 2012))).
In these circumstances, the Court should find that the ALJ's determination that Plaintiff did not meet the requirements of Listing 14.06 was not erroneous.

C. Accommodations Listed in the State Agency Consultants' Opinions
Plaintiff contends that the ALJ erred by ignoring a list of "[e]xamples of reasonable accommodations for people with dysauton[o]mia" that was included in the State agency consultants' determinations at the initial level and on reconsideration.39 ECF No. 17-3 at 23, 38, 52; see also ECF No. 20-1 at 31. The argument should be rejected.
In the RFC sections of each of the State agency consultants' determinations, after the assessment of Plaintiff's exertional limitations (lifting/carrying, standing/walking, sitting, pushing/pulling), postural limitations (climbing ropes/stairs, climbing ladders/ropes/scaffolds, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, crawling), and environmental limitations (hazards), there is a section for "Additional Explanations." [*65]  ECF No. 17-3 at 21-23, 36-38, 50-52. That section includes a narrative of Plaintiff's medical history, documenting her diagnosis and treatment for Lyme disease and POTS; unremarkable findings on a neurological examination; allegations of fatigue, brain fog, and dizziness; diagnoses without supporting evidence of myalgia, myositis, and ulcerative colitis; and mildly restricted activities of daily living. See, e.g., id. at 22-23. Thereafter, the list of "[e]xamples of reasonable accommodations for people with dysauton[o]mia" appears:
-being allowed time off if you need medical treatment for dysautonomia;
-a greater amount of breaks;
-an ergonomic chair and desk that enable those with dysautonomia to be able to sit more comfortably;
-lighting adjustments;
-a temperature-controlled workspace;
-access to foods, medicines and liquids;
-extra time to complete assignments so long as there is no set deadline;
-being able to telecommute on symptomatic days; and
-being able to stray from the dress code if you need to wear compression stockings.
Id. at 23. The section concludes with the statement, "These findings complete the medical portion of the disability determination." Id. Plaintiff seems to maintain [*66]  that not only was the ALJ required to consider these accommodations, but that he was also required to adopt them. See ECF No. 20-1 at 31-32; ECF No. 27 at 8 (stating that "[t]he omissions [of the listed accommodations] are reversible error").
To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the ALJ was compelled to incorporate those accommodations into the Plaintiff's RFC, she is mistaken. Whereas, at the State agency level, the RFC assessment is made by the disability examiner and/or medical or psychological consultant, when a claim proceeds to a hearing before an ALJ, "[r]esponsibility for assessing residual functional capacity" lies with the ALJ. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1546(a), (c), 416.946(a), (c) (2016); cf. Boyd v. Colvin, 831 F.3d 1015, 1020 (8th Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is the responsibility of the ALJ, not a physician, to determine a claimant's RFC."). In doing so, ALJs "are not bound by any findings made by State agency medical or psychological consultants, or other program physicians or psychologists." 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(e)(2)(i) (2016).
However, an ALJ is required to "consider findings and other opinions of State agency medical and psychological consultants . . . as opinion evidence, except for the ultimate determination about whether [the claimant is] disabled." Id. Nevertheless, Plaintiff has not established [*67]  that the "[e]xamples of reasonable accommodation" constitute a finding or opinion about her RFC. Residual Functional Capacity is "the most [an individual] can still do despite [her] limitations." 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545(a)(1), 416.945(a)(1). Nothing in that list of "examples" of accommodations purports to be a limitation keyed to Plaintiff, specifically.40 It is merely a general list of potential "reasonable accommodations" that might be appropriate for some individuals with dysautonomia in some workplaces.
Moreover, "reasonable accommodations" have nothing to do with Social Security disability determinations. Social Security disability determinations focus on whether an individual has the RFC—defined, as noted, as "the most [an individual] can still do despite [her] limitations," 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545(a)(1), 416.945(a)(1)—to perform any job that exists in significant numbers in the national economy. See id. §§ 404.1520, 404.1560(c), 416.920, 416.960(c). To make that determination, the SSA employs the five-step sequential inquiry "that embodies a set of presumptions about disabilities, job availability, and their interrelation." Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 804, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999). The term "reasonable accommodation," on the other hand, comes from the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9) (providing examples of "reasonable accommodation[s]."). "[T]he matter of [*68]  'reasonable accommodation,'" unlike the question of whether an individual's RFC precludes work under the Social Security disability regime, is "workplace-specific." Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 803. Critically, a reasonable accommodation is adopted so that the employee can continue to work. See, e.g., Johnson v. District of Columbia, 207 F. Supp. 3d 3, 14 (D.D.C. 2016) ("The ADA contemplates a 'flexible give-and-take between employer and employee so that together they can determine what accommodation would enable the employee to continue working.'" (quoting Ward v. McDonald, 762 F.3d 24, 32, 412 U.S. App. D.C. 24 (D.C. Cir. 2014))). That is, the rational interpretation of those "reasonable accommodations" is that they were offered not as examples of limitations applicable to Plaintiff herself, but as modifications that, if found to be tenable in a particular work setting, might allow a person suffering from dysautonomia to continue working. Thus, if the ALJ were to consider the "reasonable accommodations" listed in the State agency consultants' reports, that would, in theory, cut against a finding of disability. However, as the Supreme Court has recognized, the SSA omits consideration of reasonable accommodations from its disability determinations. See Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 803 ("The omission reflects the fact that the SSA receives more than 2.5 million claims for disability [*69]  benefits each year; its administrative resources are limited; the matter of 'reasonable accommodation' may turn on highly disputed workplace-specific matters; and an SSA misjudgment about that detailed, and often fact-specific matter would deprive a seriously disabled person of the critical financial support the state seeks to provide."). Had the ALJ considered them as Plaintiff urges, that might well have been error. See Singleton v. Berryhill, 17-cv-576, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164521, 2018 WL 4579711, at *3-4 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 25, 2018) ("[T]he ALJ . . . erred by injecting [a] reasonable accommodation analysis into his disability determination."). But his failure to adopt them was not.
For these reasons, the Court should find that the ALJ did not err by failing to incorporate the "[e]xamples of reasonable accommodations" into Plaintiff's RFC.

D. Evidence from December 9, 2012, through December 2013
Plaintiff asserts that her "evidence of disability for the first 13 months [after the alleged onset date] was uncontradicted, except by unsupported . . . opinions" of the State agency consultants, which were issued in early 2014. ECF No. 20-1 at 33-34; see also ECF No. 17-3 at 2-25, 29-56. She contends that the State agency consultants' opinions were hopelessly flawed, making any reliance on them improper [*70]  and argues that, without those opinions, uncontroverted medical and other evidence relevant to the period from December 9, 2012, through the end of 2013 established that Plaintiff was disabled during that time. Id. at 33-35 & n.17. This argument also fails.
Plaintiff asserts that the State agency consultants' opinions were faulty because they "were based on an impermissible standard." Id. at 34 n.17. Specifically, she contends that the State agency consultants "rejected [her] complaints solely on the ground that they were 'disproportionate to the severity in the MER [medical evidence of record.]'" Id. (second alteration in original); see also ECF No. 17-3 at 49. That, she maintains, contravened SSR 16-3, which states, "[W]e will not disregard an individual's statements about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of symptoms solely because the objective medical evidence does not substantiate the degree of impairment-related symptoms alleged by the individual." 2016 SSR LEXIS 4, 2016 WL 1119029, at *5 (S.S.A. Mar. 26, 2016) (emphasis added).
Plaintiff appears to think that all medical evidence of record constitutes "objective medical evidence." She is mistaken. At the time of the ALJ's opinion, "objective medical evidence" was defined as "medical [*71]  signs and laboratory findings," as distinguished from "[o]ther evidence from medical sources, such as medical history, opinions, and statements about treatment you have received."41 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512(b)(1)(ii), (iii), 416.912(b)(1)(ii), (iii); see also SSR 16-3, 2016 SSR LEXIS 4, 2016 WL 1119029, at *6 (contrasting objective medical evidence to other evidence from medical sources, such as "diagnoses, prognoses, and opinions as well as statements and medical reports about an individual's history, treatment, responses to treatment, prior work record, efforts to work, daily activities, and other information concerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of an individual's symptoms"). Reliance on the "medical evidence of record" to undermine a claimant's reports of her symptoms is not, then, violative of SSR 16-3 because "medical evidence" encompasses more than "objective medical evidence." Moreover, here, the State agency consultants' reports indicate that in making their findings they considered all the evidence in the record, including not only objective medical evidence, but also medical history, treatment notes, and opinion evidence. See, e.g., ECF No. 17-3 at 3-5 (listing the evidence of record), 6 (analyzing the evidence of record), 8 (noting that activities of daily living, medication [*72]  treatment, and treatment other than mediation were considered), 10-11 (providing additional explanation). That is what SSR 16-3 requires. See 2016 SSR LEXIS 4, 2016 WL 1119029, at *5 ("[W]e will not disregard an individual's statements about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of symptoms solely because the objective medical evidence does not substantiate the degree of impairment-related symptoms alleged by the individual." (emphasis added)).
Plaintiff also faults the State agency consultants for allegedly relying on only "a single set of findings of normal gait and neurological exam in 2012, and another set of normal strength and neurological findings in 2013," pointing to other evidence in the record that might support a finding of disability. ECF No. 20-1 at 34 n.17. But, as just noted, the consultants examined all the evidence of record and made their determination. Plaintiff asserts that there is evidence in the record that could support a determination of disability during this period. Maybe so. But substantial evidence is a "low bar," La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 20 F.4th at 7, that is not overcome merely by showing that "substantial evidence may support the plaintiff's position." Ali, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 90.
More fundamentally, Plaintiff's argument ignores the fact that it is [*73]  the ALJ's duty to consider the State agency consultants' opinions, see 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(e)(2)(i) (2016), and his prerogative to weigh those opinions, see, e.g., Fontenot v. Colvin, 661 F. App'x 274, 277 (5th Cir. 2016) ("[T]he ALJ is entitled to determine the credibility of medical experts as well as lay witnesses and to weigh their opinions and testimony accordingly." (quoting Moore v. Sullivan, 919 F.2d 901, 905 (5th Cir. 1990)). The ALJ here did so, explaining that those opinions deserved partial weight because they were "partially consistent with the medical evidence," which showed, for example, largely normal findings on examination and impairments that were well-controlled by medication. ECF No. 17-2 at 37. Those opinions, in turn, provided substantial evidence supporting a finding of non-disability for the period between the alleged onset date and early 2014. See, e.g., Fontenot, 661 F. App'x at 277 (finding that reliance on "two consultative examiners and the review physician" provides "more than a mere scintilla [of evidence]"); Bechdel v. Saul, No. 19-cv-00584, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132001, 2020 WL 4284063, at *7 (M.D. Pa. July 27, 2020) (stating that "[a]n ALJ may rely on a state agency medical consultation" and citing Jones v. Sullivan, 954 F.2d 125, 129 (3d Cir. 1991), for the proposition that an ALJ "relie[s] on substantial evidence when he relie[s] on a state agency medical consultation"); Allen v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 351 F. Supp. 3d 327, 335 (W.D.N.Y. 2018) ("[A]n ALJ is entitled to rely on the opinions of . . . non-examining State agency medical consultants, [*74]  because those consultants are deemed to be qualified experts in the field of social security disability." (emphasis omitted) (quoting Bump v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., No 15-cv-1077, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149419, 2016 WL 6311872, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 28, 2016))). Additionally, the fact that evidence showed that Plaintiff's impairments were controlled when she later began treatment (an issue discussed in more detail below in Section III.E) establishes that they were not disabling.42 See Lopez v. Colvin, 194 F. Supp. 3d 903, 910 (D. Ariz. 2016) ("'Impairments that can be controlled effectively with medication are not disabling for the purpose of determining eligibility for SSI benefits.' Thus, the ALJ is entitled to discount a claimant's symptom testimony if the testimony relates to a period when the claimant was not using medication or other treatment, and there is evidence that the symptoms in question could have been effectively controlled with treatment." (internal citation omitted) (quoting Warre v. Comm'r, 439 F.3d 1001, 1006 (9th Cir. 2006))); see also, e.g. Elder v. Berryhill, 774 F. App'x 980, 984-85 (7th Cir. 2019) (holding that a condition that the ALJ concluded was "controllable with medication" was not disabling as a matter of law); Roth v. Shalala, 45 F.3d 279, 282 (8th Cir. 1995) ("If an impairment can be controlled by treatment or medication, it cannot be considered disabling." (quoting Stout v. Shalala, 988 F.2d 853, 855 (8th Cir.1993))); Gross v. Heckler, 785 F.2d 1163, 1166 (4th Cir. 1986) ("If a symptom can be reasonably controlled by medication or treatment, it is not disabling."); Sanchez v. Berryhill, No. 18-cv-00238, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44299, 2019 WL 1254997, at *5 (D. Colo. Mar. 18, 2019) (similar).
In sum, Plaintiff [*75]  has not demonstrated reversible error on this issue.

E. Extrapolation of Medical Evidence
In this section of her brief, Plaintiff makes two arguments. First, she complains that the ALJ "improperly and consistently tried to apply examinations and statements given at one point in time to cover the entire period before him." ECF No. 20-1 at 36. Second, she asserts that the ALJ erroneously found that her conditions had improved. Id. at 37. Neither argument succeeds.
As to the ALJ's alleged application of medical findings "to cover the entire period" at issue, Plaintiff's position seems to be that medical evidence such as treatment notes or reports by consultative examiners are "single, one-time event[s], which ha[ve] no bearing on any other time period." Id. at 36. She cites nothing to support this principle except a Second Circuit case in which the court found that an ALJ misunderstood a claimant's hearing testimony about his increased activities of daily living to apply to a time period two years prior to the hearing—before the claimant had undergone bariatric surgery that significantly improved his conditions—rather than to the period post-operation. See Genier v. Astrue, 606 F.3d 46, 47-48 (2d Cir. 2010). The Second Circuit found that [*76]  this misunderstanding in tandem with others was "so serious" that the ALJ could not be deemed to have complied with the requirement that the claimant's reports of his symptoms and activities be taken into account. Id. at 50. That case hardly stands for the more general proposition that Plaintiff posits that all medical evidence should be considered by an ALJ as "single, one-time event[s]" reflecting only the moment it is collected and should "ha[ve] no bearing on any other time period." See ECF No. 20-1 at 36.
Plaintiff has a more focused argument, as well. She asserts that the ALJ wrongly
discounted all of [her] complaints, 2013 and 2014 function reports43 and 2016 testimony, the opinions of her treating physicians, and her sister's confirmation of brain fog, slowed thinking, very slowed decision-making, 15+ point drop in I.Q., lifelong and well-documented learning disorders, inability to make change, difficulty sustaining a conversation, et cetera, on the grounds that a January, 2014, examination by an agency psychiatrist [characterized her] as "normal."
Id. That is, she contends that the ALJ ignored such evidence in favor of Dr. Wangard's opinion after her consultative psychological examination. [*77]  The undersigned is not persuaded. First, "[i]t is well settled that an ALJ is entitled to rely upon the opinions of consultative examiners, and such written reports can constitute substantial evidence." Susan B. v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 551 F. Supp. 3d 107, 120 (W.D.N.Y. 2021) (quoting Bona v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., No. 15-cv-658, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96566, 2016 WL 4017336, at *11 (W.D.N.Y. July 22, 2016)). Second, Plaintiff's characterization of the ALJ's opinion is simply inaccurate. For example, the ALJ noted that Plaintiff had "complained of brain fog" on multiple occasions, which appeared to be a medication side effect (as examinations generally revealed normal cognition). ECF No. 17-2 at 35. He further observed that Plaintiff reported improved cognitive ability in 2014 and 2015 after her propranolol dose was reduced. Id. He further found that the symptoms from her psychological impairments were controlled by medication as evidenced by treatment notes in 2014 and 2015 and that when she reported increased symptoms due to a medication change, she was taken off the offending medication and prescribed something new. Id. at 36. He also noted that Plaintiff had not received treatment from a mental health specialist or required emergency room treatment or hospitalization due to a mental impairment. Id. A brain MRI was normal and she reported to her neurologist that her weakness [*78]  had improved. Id. at 33-34. Addressing Dr. Wangard's opinion, the ALJ gave it partial weight, explaining that her affective mood disorder and anxiety-related disorder had responded well to medication, as evidenced by her reports and by examinations that were unremarkable "except for some lethargy, anxiety, and tearfulness at times." Id. at 37. He additionally found that Plaintiff's reports of the severity of her symptoms was undercut by her own activities. Id. at 35-36. That is to say, the ALJ's determination was based on an array of evidence, not merely Dr. Wangard's psychological evaluation.
Plaintiff next contends that the ALJ improperly found that treatment improved her symptoms of POTS, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, digestive issues, diminished cognitive abilities, and migraine. ECF No. 20-1 at 37-38 & nn.20, 22. Plaintiff is incorrect. The ALJ's findings were supported by substantial evidence, which, again, is a "low bar." La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 20 F.4th at 7.
Regarding POTS, the ALJ noted a tentative diagnosis in March 2013 that was later confirmed. ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 59, 60-61. With medication prescribed in 2013, Plaintiff's symptoms improved. ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-9 at [*79]  34, 47, 59. Her treating physicians noted improved symptoms from November 2014 through January 2016. ECF No. 17-2 at 33; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 9 (March 2015), 94 (November 2015), 97 (August 2015), 103 (February 2015), 110 (November 2014); ECF No. 17-12 at 55 (January 2016), 66-67 (November 2015), 87 (October 2015). Plaintiff does not point to medical records that cloud the picture of improving POTS symptoms with treatment. She does note that, in February and March 2016, Plaintiff complained of blood pressure issues. ECF No. 20-1 at 22; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 136, 140. However, her treating sources responded by altering her medication dosages, ECF No. 17-12 at 137, 140, 141, which improved her blood pressure symptoms, see ECF No. 17-12 at 138. The ALJ's opinion on this issue easily clears the low bar of substantial evidence.
As to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the ALJ noted that examinations in 2013 revealed weakness. ECF No. 17-2 at 34. When she presented for the first time to a rheumatology clinic in February 2014, she had full strength with the exception of her shoulder (which was at 4 out of 5 on the strength scale) and full range of motion. Id.; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 139-41. [*80]  As the ALJ noted, Plaintiff reported improvement in her symptoms with medication throughout 2014 and early 2015, such that her weakness had largely resolved by February 2015. ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 105 (February 2015), 110 (November 2014), 116 (September 2014), 122 (August 2014), 129 (April 2014). Plaintiff points to no medical evidence that undermines the ALJ's assessment that Plaintiff's symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome improved with treatment.
As the ALJ observed, Plaintiff's digestive issues were well-controlled with medication through 2015. ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 60 (December 2015), 87 (October 2015), 94 (October 2015), 101 (August 2015). Again, Plaintiff points to no medical evidence that undermines the ALJ's assessment that her digestive issues were responsive to medication, except to remark that she continued to have flare-ups (which the ALJ noted) and asked to change her antidepressant medication (which also helped her digestive complaints) in 2016. ECF No. 20-1 at 37 n.20. Similarly, the ALJ found that after medication adjustment, Plaintiff reported that her cognitive abilities improved with medication adjustment, ECF No. 17-2 [*81]  at 35; see also ECF No. 17-11 at 97 (August 2015), 110 (November 2014), and Plaintiff does not cite medical evidence to the contrary.
Finally, the ALJ found that propranolol, which was prescribed in March 2013, improved Plaintiff's migraine headaches (prior to that, she was on no preventative medication for migraine). ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 61. He highlighted that by January 2014, treatment notes reflect that her migraines were "under control," ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-9 at 33, and that Plaintiff reported in August and October 2015 that her migraines remained well-controlled, ECF No. 17-2 at 34; see also ECF No. 17-12 at 87, 102. Nevertheless, Plaintiff here asserts that "her migraines were not controlled, except for brief periods." ECF No. 27 at 9 n.5. As support, she cites an array of treatment notes and other medical records she asserts shows that her migraines continued. Id. However, a closer look reveals that the vast majority of those records that post-date the beginning of her treatment (in March 2013) do not reflect visits during which Plaintiff sought treatment for headaches. Rather, migraines are merely noted as part of the patient's medical [*82]  history. See, e.g., ECF No. 17-9 at 47 (letter from cardiologist dated November 2013), 49 (letter from cardiologist dated July 2013); ECF No. 17-11 at 50 (treatment note from rheumatologist dated February 2014), 110 (treatment note from rheumatologist dated November 2014), 125 (treatment note from rheumatologist dated May 2014), 129 (treatment note from rheumatologist dated April 2014); ECF No. 17-12 at 62 (treatment note regarding switching antidepressant dated December 2015), 66-67 (letter from cardiologist dated November 2015). One record that does, from April 2013 (the month after she first began propranolol) reflects that she was having less frequent headaches.44 ECF No. 17-9 at 56. Another record form two-and-ahalf years later notes that she only "occasionally has headaches." ECF No. 17-12 at 66-67. None of that vitiates the substantial evidence on which the ALJ based his assessment that Plaintiff's migraines improved with treatment.
The Court should find that Plaintiff's argument on this issue fails.

F. Requirement of Objective Medical Evidence Regarding Symptoms
Returning to SSR 16-3, Plaintiff asserts that the ALJ violated the ruling by requiring objective medical evidence [*83]  to corroborate the frequency, duration, and severity of her symptoms. ECF No. 20-1 at 39-41. The ALJ did no such thing. Rather, in evaluating Plaintiff's symptoms, the ALJ considered objective medical evidence in combination with Plaintiff's reports to her treating sources and her doctors' reports of improvement with medication. For example, as discussed in more detail above, the ALJ found that symptoms related to Plaintiff's POTS, migraines, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome improved with medication, as she reported to her physicians. ECF No. 17-2 at 33-35. He further found that Plaintiff's own reports of her daily living activities were not entirely consistent with her alleged symptoms. Id. at 35-36. That is, the ALJ did not "disregard [Plaintiff's] statements about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effect of [her] symptoms solely because the objective medical evidence [did] not substantiate [them]." SSR 16-3, 2016 SSR LEXIS 4, 2016 WL 1119029, at *5. Instead, as contemplated by SSR 16-3, the ALJ considered the objective medical evidence along with other evidence from medical sources, such as Plaintiff's reports to her doctors and her responses to treatment, to find that her statements about her symptoms were "not [*84]  entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in the record." ECF 17-2 at 33; see also SSR 16-3, 2016 SSR LEXIS 4, 2016 WL 1119029, at *6 ("We will consider an individual's statements about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of symptoms, and we will evaluate whether the statements are consistent with objective medical evidence and the other evidence," such as "statements and medical reports about an individual's history, treatment, responses to treatment, prior work record, efforts to work, daily activities, and other information concerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of an individual's symptoms.").
The Court should find that Plaintiff's argument on this issue fails.

G. Treating Physicians' Opinions
Plaintiff argues that the Commissioner's decision must be reversed because the ALJ failed to give controlling weight to opinions of her treating physicians, i.e., the March 2013 questionnaire completed by Dr. David, ECF No. 17-6 at 56-58; the April 2016 medical source statement from Dr. Solomon, ECF No. 17-11 at 89-92; and the June 2016 medical source statement from Dr. Hashefi, ECF No. 17-13 at 2-5.
Under the regulations in force at the time Plaintiff filed her claims, medical opinions [*85]  by an individual's treating physicians are "entitled to 'controlling weight' if they are not inconsistent with other substantial record evidence and are well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques." Butler, 353 F.3d at 1003 (citing 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2)).45 In addition, this Circuit "ha[s] a 'treating physician rule' of [its] own." Id. In the D.C. Circuit, "where 'a claimant's treating physicians have a great familiarity with [his or her] condition, their reports must be accorded substantial weight.'" Kenner v. Berryhill, 316 F. Supp. 3d 530, 536 (D.D.C. 2018) (quoting Holland v. Berryhill, 273 F. Supp. 3d 55, 63 (D.D.C. 2017)). Thus, "[a] treating physician's report is 'binding on the fact-finder unless contradicted by substantial evidence.'" Butler, 353 F.3d at 1003 (quoting Williams v. Shalala, 997 F.2d 1494, 1498, 302 U.S. App. D.C. 292 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). If an ALJ fails to give a treating physician's opinion controlling or substantial weight, he must explain "why he has rejected the treating physician's opinion and how the doctor's assessment is contradicted by substantial evidence." Kenner, 316 F. Supp. 3d at 537 (quoting Jacob v. Berryhill, No. 15-cv-600, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47594, 2017 WL 1194165, at *6 (D.D.C. Mar. 30, 2017)); see also Butler, 353 F.3d at 1003 ("As the regulations assure claimants, '[w]e will always give good reasons in our notice of . . . decision for the weight we give your treating source's opinion.'" (alterations in original) (quoting 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2))). A "bare statement" rejecting the opinion, without an explanation of the reason for doing so, [*86]  is insufficient. Jones v. Astrue, 647 F.3d 350, 355, 396 U.S. App. D.C. 235 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Here, the ALJ provided good reasons for his failure to give controlling weight to each of the opinions at issue.
First, in weighing each of the pieces of opinion evidence, the ALJ engaged in the proper analysis, considering "the length, nature, and extent of the treating relationship, the frequency of examinations, the supportability by other evidence given by the medical source, the extent of the explanation, and the consistency with the record as a whole." ECF No. 17-2 at 38 (citing 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(d), 416.927(d), SSR 96-2p, and SSR 96-5p). Plaintiff—in her reply brief—faults the ALJ for not "articulat[ing] his application" of these factors, ECF No. 27 at 20-21, but that argument fails. As noted repeatedly in this Report and Recommendation, arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief may be deemed forfeited. See, e.g., Am. Wildlands, 530 F.3d at 1001. But even if it were not forfeited, it would not succeed. It is well established that an ALJ "has no obligation . . . to expressly discuss each of the factors in according weight to a physician's opinion." Gordon v. Colvin, No. 15-cv-1028, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144149, 2016 WL 6088263, at *17 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2016), report and recommendation adopted, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143603, 2016 WL 6088266 (D.D.C. Oct. 18, 2016); see also Turner, 857 F. Supp. 2d at 154-55 (similar). Rather, "[w]here the ALJ's 'reasoning and adherence to the regulation[s] are clear,' a 'slavish recitation of each and every' [*87]  factor to be considered in assigning weight to a treating source's opinion is not required." Patricia T. v. Kijakazi, No. 21-cv-1028, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150324, 2022 WL 3583634, at *14 n.12 (D.D.C. Aug. 22, 2022) (internal citation omitted) (second alteration in original) (quoting Morales v. Berryhill, 484 F. Supp. 3d 130, 143 (S.D.N.Y. 2020)). That is the case here.
Assessing Dr. David's opinion that Plaintiff could not make decisions and presented a risk of falling, ECF No. 17-6 at 56, 58, the ALJ gave it diminished weight because it was "only partially consistent with the medical evidence." ECF No. 17-2 at 37. Specifically, he noted that although Dr. David described an unsteady gait and slow movement in the aftermath of Plaintiff's emergency room visit in December 2012, after Plaintiff was prescribed midodrine and Florinef she reported improvement in her symptoms corroborated by an absence of abnormal gait on examination. Id. at 38; see also, e.g., ECF No. 17-9 at 49 (reporting improvement in Plaintiff's symptoms in July 2013), 51 (same, in May 2013). The ALJ further cited Dr. Wangard's consultative psychological examination report, which related that Plaintiff had good judgment, and Plaintiff's testimony that she was able to drive once per week. Id. That explanation is sufficient. See, e.g., Grant v. Astrue, 857 F. Supp. 2d 146, 155 (D.D.C. 2012) (finding no error in the ALJ's assessment that a treating physician's [*88]  opinion was not entitled to controlling weight where the opinion was "contradicted by other evidence in the record" and clinical findings did not support it); Turner v. Astrue, 710 F. Supp. 2d 95, 106 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding no error in the ALJ's assessment that a treating physician's opinion was not entitled to controlling weight where the ALJ stated that he considered the opinion evidence in accordance with the regulations and explained why he believed that the opinion was not supported by the medical evidence); see also McGraw v. Berryhill, No. 17-cv-1011, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151173, 2019 WL 4222703, at *4 (D.D.C. Sept. 5, 2019) ("An ALJ is generally not expected to provide more detail than citing . . . the contradictory evidence in his report.").
Similarly, the ALJ sufficiently explained why he did not give Dr. Solomon's April 2016 medical source statement controlling weight. ECF No. 17-2 at 38. There, Dr. Solomon assessed significant limitations, stating, for example, that Plaintiff could sit and stand/walk for less than two hours of an eight-hour workday and was required to elevate her legs after sitting for twenty minutes. ECF No. 17-11 at 89-93. The ALJ provided multiple reasons for discounting that opinion. First, he noted that Dr. Solomon had seen Plaintiff only rarely—four times in two-and-a-half years. ECF No. 17-2 at 38; see, e.g., [*89]  Mason v. Berryhill, No. 16-cv-1501, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 231357, 2017 WL 10350566, at *3, 10 (D.D.C. Dec. 19, 2017) (relying in part on the fact that the treating physician had seen the plaintiff only three times in six months to uphold the ALJ's decision not to give that physician's opinion controlling weight), report and recommendation adopted, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 238884, 2018 WL 4759839 (D.D.C. Jan. 16, 2018). Second, he discounted the opinion because it was not based on objective medical findings, but rather, explicitly asserted that it was based on Plaintiff's "subjective self-report." ECF No. 17-2 at 38; see Vanhoose v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., No. 14-cv-708, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67112, 2015 WL 2453102, at *9 (N.D. Ohio May 22, 2015) (upholding the ALJ's decision to give a treating physician's opinion less-than-controlling weight where it "indicated that [the] restrictions were based on [the] [p]laintiff's self-reports and not on any objective findings" and stating that "[a] treating physician's opinion is not entitled to controlling weight when it lacks an objective basis"). More, Dr. Solomon's opinion was contradicted by his own treatment note from Plaintiff's thenmost recent examination, which stated that Plaintiff's symptoms had improved with medication and that she was doing "very well from a cardiac point of view." ECF No. 17-2 at 38; see Turner, 710 F. Supp. 2d at 106 ("[T]he ALJ satisfied his burden to produce substantial evidence contradicting [a treating physician's] opinions by drawing on the physician's [*90]  own treatment notes and the opinions of other doctors."); see also, e.g., Moore v. Astrue, No. 09-cv-825, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40192, 2011 WL 1398480, at *4 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 13, 2011) ("The ALJ had a substantial basis for rejecting [the treating physician's] opinion. As the ALJ correctly found, [the physician's] determination of [the] [p]laintiff's residual functional capacity was contradicted by other substantial evidence in the report, including his own treatment notes.").
The ALJ also rejected Dr. Hashefi's medical source statement assessing even more drastic limitations than Dr. Solomon, including a restriction to sitting for a maximum of fifteen minutes per hour and lifting/carrying less than five pounds; a near-complete ban on reaching, stooping, bending, squatting, and kneeling; and a finding that Plaintiff was "[i]ncapable of even low-stress jobs." See generally ECF No. 17-13 at 2-5. Again, the ALJ found the opinion inconsistent with the generally unremarkable examination findings by Dr. Hashefi and other physicians, as well as those physicians' assessments that Plaintiff's symptoms improved with medication. ECF No. 17-2 at 38. As above, the ALJ fulfilled his duty to provide good reasons for his decision to give Dr. Hashefi's opinion less-than-controlling weight. See Grant, 857 F. Supp. 2d at 155 (D.D.C. 2012) (finding no error [*91]  in the ALJ's assessment that a treating physician's opinion was not entitled to controlling weight where the opinion was "contradicted by other evidence in the record" and clinical findings did not support it); Turner, 710 F. Supp. 2d at 106 ("[T]he ALJ satisfied his burden to produce substantial evidence contradicting [a treating physician's] opinions by drawing on the physician's own treatment notes and the opinions of other doctors.").
In sum, the ALJ did not merely provide a "bare statement" rejecting these opinions or fail to "acknowledge the contradictory evidence in the record [that] 'supplie[d] the reason' for rejecting the treating physician's opinion." Jones, 647 F.3d at 355, 357 (alterations in original) (quoting Butler, 353 F.3d at 1002). Rather, "the ALJ acknowledged all of the medical opinions in the record, explained why he viewed certain evidence as more credible than other evidence, and adequately explained why he did not give 'controlling weight' to the [treating physician's] assessments[.]" Hartline v. Astrue, 605 F. Supp. 2d 194, 209 (D.D.C. 2009). That is all that is required.

H. Logical Bridge
Recall that the ALJ found that Plaintiff had the RFC to perform "light work with occasional performance of most postural maneuvers, no climbing of ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, and avoiding concentrated exposure [*92]  to extreme cold, extreme heat, and hazards." ECF No. 17-2 at 35. As noted, the regulations define "light work" as involving "lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds." 20 C.F.R. § 416.967(b). The full range of light work requires "sitting most of the time," id., and "standing or walking, off and on, for . . . approximately 6 hours of an 8-hour workday," SSR 83-10, 1983 SSR LEXIS 30, 1983 WL 31251, at *5-6 (S.S.A. Jan. 1, 1983).
Plaintiff asserts that, in determining that RFC, the ALJ failed to "build a 'logical bridge' between the evidence and [the RFC's] . . . conclusions." ECF No. 20-1 at 49 (quoting Pittman v. Berryhill, No. 15-cv-1543, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51081, 2017 WL 1292980, at *5 (D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2017), report and recommendation adopted, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51405, 2017 WL 1185209 (D.D.C. Mar. 29, 2017)). More specifically, she contends that the ALJ did not "evaluate each of [Plaintiff's] relevant functional deficits . . . on a function-by-function basis" and did not "assess[] the functional impact of [Plaintiff's] deficits in combination." ECF No. 20-1 at 50-51 (footnotes omitted). Again, these arguments fail.
The "function-by-function" terminology comes from SSA 96-8p, which states that an ALJ must "identify the individual's functional limitations or restrictions and assess his or her work-related abilities on a function-by-function basis," including the following functions: [*93]  sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling. 1996 SSR LEXIS 5, 1996 WL 374184, at *3, 5 (S.S.A. July 2, 1996). However, cases have rejected the argument that "the ALJ's opinion must include an analysis that addresses in writing each and every work-related function listed in SSR 96-8p." Kim M. v. Kijakazi, No. 20-cv-2072, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167402, 2021 WL 4033060, at *7 (D.D.C. Sept. 3, 2021). Rather, an ALJ is merely required to "provide[] a thorough narrative discussion of [a plaintiff's] limitations'" and "buil[d] a 'logical bridge' from the evidence to his conclusion." Contreras v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 239 F. Supp. 3d 203, 207 (D.D.C. 2017) (quoting Banks v. Astrue, 537 F. Supp. 2d 75, 85 (D.D.C. 2008)); see also Nsiah v. Saul, No. 19-cv-42, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20280, 2021 WL 372784, at *14 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2021) ("[A] narrative discussion 'is sufficient for the ALJ to fulfill [his] obligation to complete a function-by-function analysis that allows the [court] to conduct meaningful review.'" (quoting Davis v. Berryhill, 272 F. Supp. 3d 154, 172 (D.D.C. 2017))).
Here, the ALJ sufficiently expressed the reasoning underlying his assessment of Plaintiff's RFC through his discussion of the medical and other evidence. For example, he pointed out that the State agency consultants on reconsideration found that Plaintiff could perform light work—specifically, she could stand and/or walk for six hours in an eight-hour workday, sit for six hours in an eight-hour workday, frequently lift ten pounds, and occasionally lift twenty pounds—with some postural and hazard limitations. ECF No. 17-2 at 37; see also ECF No. 17-3 at 36. [*94]  That opinion was bolstered with evidence post-dating the State agency consultants' reconsideration opinion, discussed in depth by the ALJ, that Plaintiff's impairments improved with treatment, also undermining Plaintiff's gravest descriptions of her symptoms. See ECF No. 17-2 at 32-37; see, e.g., Chandler v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d 356, 361-62 (3d Cir. 2011) ("The ALJ was entitled to rely on [the State agency consultant's] opinion [in assessing the plaintiff's RFC."); Skeens v. Astrue, 903 F. Supp. 2d 1200, 1208 (W.D. Wash. 2012) (similar); see also Hardin v. Berryhill, No. 16-cv-45, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28509, 2017 WL 814722, at *5 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 1, 2017) (noting that an ALJ "may rely on a consultative opinion even where the consultative examiner did not have access to the entire case record" as long as there is "'some indication that the ALJ at least considered' the medical evidence which was unavailable to the consultative examiner" (quoting Blakley v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 581 F.3d 399, 409 (6th Cir. 2009))). As for postural limitations, the ALJ prescribed more restrictive limitations than did the State agency consultants, based on his review of the medical and other evidence. Compare ECF No. 17-2 at 31 (restricting Plaintiff to occasionally climbing ramps and stairs, balancing, stopping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling; never climbing ladders ropes, or scaffolds; and avoiding concentrated exposure to extreme heat and cold and hazards) with ECF No. 17-3 at 36-37 (limiting [*95]  Plaintiff to frequently climbing ramps and stairs and balancing; occasionally stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling; never climbing ladders, ramps, or scaffolds; and avoiding concentrated exposure only to hazards). That was also permissible. See, e.g., Chandler, 667 F.3d at 361-62 (finding no error where the ALJ adopted many of the State agency consultant's limitations and also "added restrictions [the consultant] did not deem necessary").
Plaintiff next asserts that the ALJ failed to consider her impairments in combination. She is again incorrect. "The ALJ is required to assess the combined effect of a claimant's impairments throughout the five-step analytical process." Fleming v. Barnhart, 284 F. Supp. 2d 256, 270 (D. Md. 2003); see also 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(2)(B) ("If the Commissioner of Social Security does find a medically severe combination of impairments, the combined impact of the impairments shall be considered throughout the disability determination process."). Here, the ALJ clearly considered the combined effect of Plaintiff's impairments, including her obesity, POTS, connective tissue disease, headaches, and digestive impairments. First, with respect to Plaintiff's obesity, the ALJ specifically considered this condition "singly and in combination with her other impairments" but [*96]  concluded that it did not require additional limitations in light of the fact that since receiving treatment for "POTS, Ehlers-Danlos, and her other impairments, physical examinations [had] been quite unremarkable . . . and [had] not generally revealed significant difficulty moving about." ECF No. 17-2 at 35. He then explained that he had limited her to light work with additional postural limitations based on her "symptoms of POTS, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, migraine, gastritis, . . . irritable bowel syndrome," and "chronic fatigue syndrome," finding a more restrictive RFC inappropriate in light of the medical record, which showed that "medication ha[d] been effective in reducing and ultimately controlling most symptoms and physical examinations ha[d] generally not revealed significant abnormalities." Id. However, in light of her complaints of brain fog and chronic fatigue syndrome, he "limited her to no production rate for pace of work."46 Id. No further non-exertional limitations were necessary because her affective mood disorder and anxiety-related disorder were also effectively controlled with medication. Id. at 36. In concluding this assessment based on "all of [Plaintiff's] complaints, [*97]  including blood pressure fluctuations, dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, pain, weakness, fatigue, and medication side effects," the ALJ found that the medical evidence "fail[ed] to support a conclusion that [Plaintiff] ha[d] any additional functional limitations" other than the ones assessed. Id. at 39. Thus, the ALJ did consider Plaintiff's impairments both singly and in combination and "sufficiently articulate[d] his assessment of the evidence to assure [the undersigned] that [he] considered the important evidence . . . and to enable [the undersigned] to trace the path of the ALJ's reasoning." David W. v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., No. 17-cv-4336, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40584, 2019 WL 1197691, at *8 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 3, 2019) (ellipses in original) (quoting Carlson v. Shalala, 999 F.2d 180, 181 (7th Cir. 1993) (per curiam)), report and recommendation adopted sub nom. David W. v. Berryhill, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40201, 2019 WL 1173335 (C.D. Ill. Mar. 13, 2019).
The Court should reject Plaintiff's argument on this issue.

I. Vocational Expert Hypotheticals
Last, Plaintiff attacks the ALJ's reliance on the State agency consultants' opinions to formulate his hypothetical questions to the VE. "Testimony of a VE constitutes substantial evidence for purposes of judicial review where his opinion is based on consideration of all the evidence in the record and is in response to a proper hypothetical which fairly sets [*98]  out all of [the] claimant's impairments." Turner, 710 F. Supp. 2d at 109 (quoting Prunty v. Barnhart, No. 04-cv-38, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16594, 2005 WL 1926611, at *3 (W.D. Va. Aug. 9, 2005)). Plaintiff charges that the only evidence in the record to show that she could "stand, walk, and sit, lift and carry, push and pull, for six hours a day, and climb stairs balance, stoop, and crouch, for three" were the State agency consultants' opinions, which could not be relied on. ECF No. 20-1 at 52. There are at least two problems with Plaintiff's argument.
First, as demonstrated above, the ALJ's RFC was supported by substantial evidence that included but was not limited to the State agency consultants' opinions, on which he was entitled to rely. That RFC was accurately reflected in the ALJ's question to the VE posing a hypothetical individual of Plaintiff's age, education, and work experience who could perform light work but only occasionally climb ramps and stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; could never climb ropes, ladders, or scaffolds; must avoid concentrated exposure to extreme heat, extreme cold, and hazards such as machinery; and was limited to simple, routine, repetitive tasks with no required production rate. ECF No. 17-2 at 77-79. Such an individual, the VE testified, could perform a number of jobs in [*99]  the national economy. Id. at 78-79. As such, the ALJ's finding that Plaintiff was not disabled was supported by substantial evidence. See id. at 40-41.
But even if that RFC were, indeed, unsupported as Plaintiff argues, she would still not have demonstrated that remand is necessary because she has once again failed to show that any error was prejudicial. Here, it is worthwhile to repeat Plaintiff's own description of her argument on this issue:
The ALJ asked the vocational expert if there were jobs for a hypothetical individual who could, inter alia, stand, walk, and sit, lift and carry, push and pull, for six hours a day, and climb stairs, balance, stoop, and crouch, for three[.] There was no evidence that she could do those things, beyond the unsupported [State agency consultants'] checklist opinions. The hypothetical to the vocational expert was not supported by substantial evidence, as the statute requires.
ECF No. 20-1 at 52 (internal citation omitted). In her focus on the requirements of light work ("stand, walk, and sit, lift and carry, push and pull, for six hours a day"), she ignores the ALJ's alternative finding, also based on the VE's testimony, that even if Plaintiff were [*100]  limited to sedentary work and had to alternate between sitting and standing every 30 minutes, there would still be jobs in the national economy she could perform. ECF No. 17-2 at 40; see also id. at 78-80. Plaintiff makes no argument that she was incapable of sedentary work, either with or without the postural limitations assessed.47 Therefore, she has not shown that any error affected her substantial rights. Cf. Buckins v. Berryhill, 706 F. App'x 380, 381 (9th Cir. 2017) (finding harmless an ALJ's error in determining that the plaintiff could perform certain jobs in the category of "light work" where the ALJ made an alternative finding, based on VE testimony, that there were sedentary occupations the plaintiff could perform); McPhee v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., No. 12-cv-13931, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88776, 2013 WL 3224420, at *4, 10 (E.D. Mich. June 25, 2013) (finding no reversible error where the ALJ noted, based on the VE's testimony, that even if he had imposed greater limitations in the plaintiff's RFC, the plaintiff could still perform the jobs identified by the VE).

IV. CONCLUSION
A court's review of a decision denying Social Security disability benefits is "statutorily limited to whether the Commissioner, acting through the ALJ, correctly applied the relevant law, and whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner's final decision[.]" Turner v. Astrue, 964 F. Supp. 2d 21, 28 (D.D.C. 2013). As [*101]  such, review is "extremely limited" and "very deferential." Elder v. Astrue, 529 F.3d 408, 413 (7th Cir. 2008). More, a plaintiff must shoulder the burden to show that she is entitled to relief under that circumscribed standard of review, including by showing that any error she identifies was not harmless. See, e.g., Melanie A.S. v. Kijakazi, No. 21-cv-185, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95214, 2022 WL 1721196, at *9 (D.D.C. May 12, 2022), report and recommendation adopted, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95144, 2022 WL 1718987 (D.D.C. May 27, 2022). Here, Plaintiff's submissions, although both expansive and fervent, fail to meet that standard. Therefore, for the reasons stated above, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's motion for judgment of reversal (ECF No. 20) be DENIED and that Defendant's motion for judgment of affirmance (ECF No. 25) be GRANTED. The undersigned further RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's motion for judgment of default (ECF No. 31) and motion to expedite (ECF No. 46) be DENIED.
