CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: (IN CHAMBERS) Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (DE 45)

I. INTRODUCTION
On July 25, 2018, Ramon Olvera ("Plaintiff') filed a Complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court against Quest Diagnostics ("Quest" or "Defendant"), Pablo Bertinelli ("Bertinelli"), and Nicole Simmet ("Simmet"). On May 24, 2019, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint ("FAC"). Following the dismissal of the individual defendants, as well as Plaintiff's defamation and harassment claims, the following claims against Quest remain: (1) age discrimination (Cal. Gov. Code § 12941); (2) disability discrimination (Cal. Gov. Code § 12940 (a) and (m)); (3) failure to provide reasonable accommodation (Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m)); (4) failure to engage in the interactive process to accommodate disability (Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n)); (5) failure to prevent/remedy discrimination and retaliation (Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(k)); (6) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (7) breach of implied-in-fact contract not to terminate without good cause; and (8) wrongful termination in violation of public policy. On July 17, 2019, Defendant removed this action [*2]  from state court, based on diversity jurisdiction.
On June 30, 2020, Defendant filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise indicated.

A. Plaintiff's Employment
Plaintiff began his employment with Defendant in 2001 and was a Route Service Representative in 2017. He was responsible for transporting biological specimens from medical facilities to labs for testing. Part of these duties required him to catalogue and segregate these specimens into appropriate sort bins and bags before delivering them to the labs. Some of these specimens were considered irreplaceable specimens, which were obtained through invasive procedures or otherwise could not be re-collected.
On numerous occasions, Plaintiff and other employees were told by their supervisors that they could be terminated only for cause, which required three write-ups in six months. (Olvera Decl. ¶ 15, ECF No. 50-3; Reed Decl. ¶ 11, ECF No. 49-13; Sosa Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, ECF No. 49-14; Spejo Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 49-15; Robles Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 49-16.) Write-ups would be purged after six months and could not [*3]  be used for future disciplinary actions. (Olvera Decl. ¶ 14; Olvera Decl., Ex. 6, ECF No. 50-9; Sosa Decl. ¶ 6-7; Robles Decl. ¶ 5.)
However, according to Defendant's employment policies, simply failing to abide by Defendant's professional standards could result in corrective action, "up to and including termination of employment." (Simmet Decl., Ex. I at 375, ECF No. 45-18.) Additionally, the policies state, "A violation of any critical standard is considered serious and depending on the severity, nature and circumstances of the error a single incident may result in termination of employment." (Simmet Decl., Ex. I at 380, ECF No. 45-18.) Further, "A violation of a Critical Standard includes but is not limited to the following: . . . the loss of a single (or more) irreplaceable specimen." (id.)
1. Supervisors' Age Comments
Throughout the course of his employment, Plaintiff received several write-ups for various performance issues, ranging from mishandling of specimens to car accidents. (Simmet Decl. ¶¶ 8-13, ECF No. 45-9.) Nonetheless, Plaintiff received several pay raises and satisfactory performance reviews until 2017. (Olvera Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, 6-7, 9; ECF No. 50-3; Olvera Decl., Ex. 6 [*4]  at 407, ECF No. 50-9.)
Around late 2015 or early 2016, before Plaintiffs first negative performance evaluation, Plaintiff overheard one of his supervisors, Bertinelli, state that he planned to "clean up the place," after which Plaintiff began to notice that older employees were singled out or terminated. (Olvera Decl. ¶¶ 52-53.) According to another former employee, Defendant actively sought to get rid of older employees in an effort to save money, going as far as instructing supervisors to scrutinize older employees more heavily to find reasons to terminate them. (Reed Decl. ¶¶ 39-42.)
2. The July 17, 2017 Incident
On July 17, 2017, Plaintiff purportedly placed an irreplaceable specimen in the wrong sort bin. Following an internal investigation, on July 28, 2017, one of Plaintiffs supervisors, Simmet, decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment. After receiving approval from the HR Service Center and Employee Relations, Defendant approved Plaintiffs termination, which was scheduled for August 22, 2017.
3. The August 18, 2017 Injury
On Friday, August 18, 2017, a few days before Plaintiffs termination, Plaintiff was injured in an auto accident. Plaintiff immediately saw a physician, who [*5]  diagnosed Plaintiff with various back injuries. Plaintiff returned to work that same afternoon and provided one of his supervisors, Joseph Banzon ("Banzon"), with a report from his physician before leaving for the weekend. (Olvera Decl. ¶¶ 45-46.) The physician's report indicated that Plaintiff's stooping, bending, lifting, pulling, and pushing capacities were severely limited and recommended that he be given modified work or, if no modified work was that he be off work. Ex. ECF No.
Upon his return on Monday, August 21, 2017, Plaintiff told Banzon that he was in a lot of pain. (Olvera Decl. ¶ 47.) Without any further discussion, Plaintiff was assigned to light duty and given paperwork until he was terminated the next day on August 22, 2017. Plaintiff was 48 years old when he was terminated.

III. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
In moving for, or opposing, a summary judgment motion, "[a] party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Both parties have filed objections to the other party's evidence, primarily based on hearsay, lack of foundation, relevance, and improper speculation. While these objections [*6]  may be cognizable at trial, on a motion for summary judgment, the Court is concerned only with the admissibility of the relevant facts at trial, and not the form of these facts as presented in the Motions. See O'Banion v. Select Portfolio Servs., Inc., No. CV 1:09-00249-EJL-CWD, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135813, 2012 WL 4793442, at *5 (D. Idaho Aug. 22, 2012) ("If the contents of the evidence could be presented in an admissible form at trial, those contents may be considered on summary judgment even if the evidence itself is hearsay."); Burch v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1119-20 (E.D. Cal. 2006) (making the distinction between facts and evidence, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e), and overruling objections that evidence was irrelevant, speculative and/or argumentative).
To the extent the Court has relied on any other evidence to which the parties have objected, the objections are OVERRULED. To the extent the Court does not, the objections are DENIED as moot.

IV. JUDICIAL STANDARD
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), a court may grant summary judgment only where "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Facts are "material" only if dispute about them may affect the outcome of the case under applicable substantive law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return [*7]  a verdict for the nonmovant. Id.
To prevail on a summary judgment motion, the movant must show that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to matters on which it has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Such a showing "must establish beyond controversy every essential element" of the movant's claim or affirmative defense. S. Cal. Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). On issues where the moving party does not have the burden of proof at trial, the moving party is required only to show that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325.
To defeat a summary judgment motion, the non-moving party may not merely rely on its pleadings or on conclusory statements. See id. at 324. Nor may the non-moving party merely attack or discredit the moving party's evidence. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., 701 F.2d 95, 97 (9th Cir. 1983). Rather, the non-moving party must affirmatively present specific evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324.

V. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against him due to his age and disability, and that Defendant breached its implied obligation not to terminate him without cause. Defendant moves for summary judgment on each of Plaintiff's claims. The Court discusses [*8]  each claim in turn.

A. Discrimination Claims
In bringing a claim for employment discrimination under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), "the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of employment discrimination." Earl v. Nielsen Media Res., Inc., 658 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Cruz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354 (2000)). If the plaintiff successfully establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show that there was a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355-56. If the defendant can show such a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant's proffered reasons are merely pretextual, and that the true motive behind the adverse employment action was discrimination. See id.
1. Claim 1: Age Discrimination
a. Plaintiff's Prima Fade Case
To state a prima facie case of age discrimination, "the plaintiff must present evidence that [he] (1) is over the age of 40; (2) suffered an adverse employment action; (3) was performing satisfactorily at the time of the adverse action; and (4) suffered the adverse action under circumstances that give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination." Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 321, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (2010).
It is undisputed that Plaintiff was over 40 [*9]  years old when he received his first negative job evaluation and write-up that resulted in his termination. The parties dispute, however, whether Plaintiff was performing competently in his position and whether he has adequately shown circumstances suggesting a discriminatory motive. Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact as to these disputed elements. First, Plaintiff received satisfactory performance evaluations until 2016, when he received his first allegedly unwarranted negative job evaluation that resulted in his termination. (Olvera Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, 6-7, 9; Olvera Decl., Ex. 6 at 407.) Second, Plaintiff has produced various comments from his supervisors suggesting that older employees were treated less favorably than their younger counterparts. (Olvera Decl. IN 52-53; Reed Decl. ¶¶ 39-42.)
Plaintiff thereby meets his burden of presenting a prima facie case, thus the burden shifts to Defendant to present a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions.

b. Defendant's Legitimate, Non-discriminatory Reason
After the plaintiff presents a prima facie case, the defendant has the burden to rebut the presumption of discrimination by articulating [*10]  a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355-56.
Defendant has provided sufficient evidence that each of its actions—giving Plaintiff a negative evaluation, write-up, and finally terminating him—were for legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. First, Plaintiff received two write-ups for mishandling a specimen and damaging his vehicle, justifying his negative evaluation. (Simmet Decl. ¶¶ 12, 14; Olvera Decl., Ex. 6 at 407.) And second, Defendant performed a full investigation and determined that Plaintiff had violated a Critical Standard on July 17, 2017, warranting his final write-up and termination. (Simmet Decl. ¶¶ 16-17; Simmet Decl., Ex. I at 380.)
Defendant thereby meets its burden of presenting legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions, thus the burden returns to Plaintiff to show that Defendant's reasons were a pretext for discrimination.

c. Pretext
After the defendant provides a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions, to overcome summary judgment, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's reason is merely pretextual, and that the true motive was discriminatory. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355-56.
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's proffered reasons are pretextual [*11]  based on three comments made by his supervisors:
(1) In late 2015 or early 2016, Plaintiff heard his supervisor, Bertinelli, state that he was going to "clean up the place," after which Plaintiff noticed that older employees were singled out or terminated. (Olvera Decl. ¶¶ 52-53.)
(2) On an unspecified date, another supervisor, Hector Almanza, told Karland Reed ("Reed"), another former Route Service Representative, that Defendant wanted to get rid of older employees because they were paid more and accrued paid time off faster. (Reed Decl. ¶ 39.)
(3) In late 2018, Reed spoke with an unnamed supervisor who stated that Defendant wanted to get rid of older employees because they were "eating up most of the money." The supervisors were thereby instructed to scrutinize older employees more heavily to find reasons to terminate them. (Id. ¶¶ 40-42.)
These comments are insufficient as a matter of law to show discriminatory motive necessary to survive summary judgment, however, as age-biased comments must be specific and sufficiently tied to the plaintiff's adverse action. Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 113 F.3d 912, 918-19 (9th Cir. 1996); see also Trop v. Sony Pictures Entm't, Inc., 129 Cal. App. 4th 1133, 1148, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 144 (2005) ("isolated comments must be contemporaneous with the discharge or causally related to the discharge decision making [*12]  process.") (quoting Kennedy v. Schoenberg, Fisher & Newman, Ltd., 140 F.3d 716, 723-25 (7th Cir. 1998)). In Nidds, the plaintiff employee relied on a supervisor's statement that "he intended to get rid of all the 'old timers' because they would not 'kiss my ass."' Id. at 915. Even though the statement showed clear animus toward older employees, the court found that the comment was not directly tied to the plaintiff's layoff, and was therefore "weak evidence and not enough to create an inference of age discrimination." id. at 918-19 (citing Nesbit v. Pepsico, Inc., 994 F.2d 703, 705 (9th Cir. 1993) (affirming summary judgment for an employer on an age discrimination claim because the statements that "[w]e don't necessarily like grey hair" and "[w]e don't want unpromotable fifty-year olds around" were not tied directly to termination)); cf Schnidrig v. Columbia Mach., Inc., 80 F.3d 1406, 1411 (9th Cir. 1996) (reversing summary judgment because statements that "the Board wanted somebody younger for the job" were directly tied to the employer's decision to reject plaintiff's job application). Just as in Nidds, the comments Plaintiff relies on here were not connected to his negative performance evaluation, final write-up, or termination. Plaintiff has offered no evidence of comments made contemporaneously to his discharge. Nor has he offered evidence creating a causal link between the comments and the discharge. Thus, [*13]  Plaintiff fails to create an inference of discrimination and thereby fails to rebut Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment for Defendant on Plaintiff's first claim for age discrimination.
2. Claim 2: Disability Discrimination
To state a prima facie case of disability discrimination, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is a qualified individual; (3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 354-355.
Plaintiff was disabled as a result of the August 18, 2017 car accident and was officially terminated just four days later, on August 22, 2017. While the parties dispute whether he qualified as disabled, Plaintiff does not provide any evidence of discriminatory motive, and thereby fails to state his prima facie case.
Even if Plaintiff could satisfy his initial burden of stating a prima facie case, however, he fails to rebut Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination. Again, Defendant has provided sufficient evidence to show that it terminated Plaintiff because of his Critical Standard violation on July 17, 2017. [*14]  Plaintiff does not dispute that his termination was decided on this date. Thus, Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant's reason is pretextual, as Defendant decided to terminate Plaintiff before he was ever disabled.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment for Defendant on Plaintiff's second claim for disability discrimination.
3. Claim 5: Failure to Prevent Discrimination
To prevail on a claim for failure to prevent discrimination, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he was subjected to discrimination; (2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination; and (3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm. Leiland v. City & Cty. of S.F., 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1103 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (citing California Civil Jury Instructions (BAJI) 12.11).
As discussed above, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on each of Plaintiff's discrimination claims. Thus, Plaintiff fails to show the first element: that he was subjected to discrimination.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment for Defendant on Plaintiff's fifth claim for failure to prevent discrimination.

B. Claims 3 and 4: Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process and Failure to Accommodate
In his Complaint, Plaintiff alleges a claim for Failure to Engage in [*15]  the Interactive Process, as well as a claim for Failure to Accommodate.
To prevail on a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process, the plaintiff must: (1) show that he initiated the interactive process or "the disability and resulting limitations [were] obvious"; (2) and "identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 1018, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009).
To prevail on a claim for failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must show that: "(1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by the FEMA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual (i.e., he or she can perform the essential functions of the position); and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Cuiellete v. City of L.A., 194 Cal. App. 4th 757, 766, 123 Cal. Rptr. 3d 562 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails on both claims. Specifically, Defendant argues that Plaintiff gave Defendant notice of his disability only by providing a doctor's note, which Defendant promptly complied with by placing him on light duty, thereby meeting both its obligations to engage in the interactive process and provide a reasonable accommodation. Indeed, the undisputed facts show that after being treated [*16]  for his injury, Plaintiff provided his supervisor, Banzon, a doctor's note advising that Plaintiff's bending, stooping, lifting, pushing, and pulling capacities were restricted and that he must be given modified work or placed off work if modified work was unavailable. (Olvera Decl. ¶¶ 43, 45; Olvera Decl. Ex. 9.) Adhering to the doctor's recommendations, Defendant placed Plaintiff on light duty and assigned him paperwork instead of his normal delivery route. (Olvera Dep. 136:11-137:13, ECF No. 45-8; Simmet Decl. ¶ 25.)
Plaintiff argues, however, that even though the light duty adhered to his doctor's recommendations, Defendant should not have relied solely on the recommendations and instead should have engaged with him further and ultimately decided that time off was necessary, as light duty was still too intensive. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim is unfounded, as Plaintiff never specifically requested a different accommodation or otherwise informed Defendant that he had additional restrictions not identified in the doctor's note. The Court agrees.
An employer's obligations under FEHA require that the employer have knowledge of the employee's disability and limitations. See [*17]  King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 443, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007) ("An employee cannot demand clairvoyance of his employer."). Thus, unless an employee's disability and limitations are obvious, an employee must ordinarily inform the employer of their limitations to begin the interactive process and seek a reasonable accommodation. See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013. While "no magic words are required" to begin this process, King, 152 Cal. App. 4th at '1/1/1, "[v]ague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations under the FEHA." Featherstone v. S. Cal. Permanente Med. Grp., 10 Cal. App. 5th 1150, 1167, 217 Cal. Rptr. 3d 258 (2017); see also Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 236-37, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997) (citing to various ADA cases, applying the same notice requirement to FEHA claims).
Plaintiff discussed his injuries with his supervisor, Banzon, only once, when he returned to work the following Monday. Plaintiff complained to Banzon that he was "in a lot of pain." (Olvera Decl. ¶¶ 47-48.) Without any further discussion, Plaintiff was assigned to light duty or modified work, as specified in the doctor's note. Plaintiff performed these duties without raising any further complaints. (See id.) Plaintiff's complaint upon his arrival at work, that he was "in a lot of pain," failed to provide Defendant with adequate notice of its obligations under FEHA to do more [*18]  than comply with the doctor's note. Plaintiff did not specify what, if any limitations he suffered that required new or different accommodations. Thus, his complaint was no more than a vague statement revealing an unspecified incapacity, which is insufficient as a matter of law to show the notice that is necessary to overcome summary judgment. See Featherstone, 10 Cal. App. 5th at 1168 (affirming summary judgment on FEHA claims for an employer, noting that a communication that the employee was hospitalized, without specifics, was insufficient to put the employer on notice) (citing Miller v. Nat'l Cas. Co., 61 F.3d 627, 629-30 (8th Cir. 1995) (affirming summary judgment on ADA claims for an employer, holding that claims of stress and a generalized statement that the plaintiff was "mentally falling apart" likewise provided insufficient notice).
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment for Defendant on Plaintiff's third and fourth claims for failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to accommodate.

C. Claims 6 and 7: Breach of Implied Contract and Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
California Labor Code § 2922 establishes a presumption of at-will employment, which may be terminated by either party at any time without cause. Id. at 335. The presumption of at-will employment may, however, [*19]  be overcome by evidence of an implied contract between the employer and employee limiting the employer's right to terminate only for good cause. See Camp v. Jeffer, Mangels, Butler & Mannaro, 35 Cal. App. 4th 620, 629, 41 Cal. Rptr. 2d 329 (1995); Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal. 3d 654, 677-80, 254 Cal. Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373 (1988). The California Supreme Court has identified four factors for determining whether such an implied contract existed: (1) the personnel policies or practices of the employer; (2) the longevity of the employee's service; (3) actions or communications by the employer reflecting assurances of continued employment; and (4) the practices of the industry in which the employee is engaged. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 337 (quoting Foley, 47 Cal. 3d at 680).
"There is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement." Foley, 47 Cal. 3d at 684 (quoting Comunale v. Traders & Gen. Ins. Co., 50 Cal. 2d 654, 658, 328 P.2d 198 (1958)). However, continued employment is not a "benefit of the agreement" where the employment is at-will. Hejmadi v. AMFAC, Inc., 202 Cal. App. 3d 525, 547, 249 Cal. Rptr. 5 (1988). Thus, in an "at-will employment relationship, breach of the implied covenant cannot logically be based on a claim that a discharge was made without good cause." Foley, 47 Cal. 3d at 698 n. 39. Precisely because such a relationship allows an employer to terminate at-will, an employee's assertion that he was terminated in "bad faith" will not establish breach of the implied [*20]  covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 351.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not have an express employment contract with Defendant. Accordingly, both of Plaintiff's claims for breach of implied contract and breach of the covenant require that an implied contract existed. See id. Thus, the Court must first determine whether Plaintiff has created a triable issue as to the existence of such a contract.
1. Whether an Implied Contract Existed
Plaintiff argues that his employment was subject to an implied contract through which Defendant could terminate Plaintiff only for good cause, as determined by its own employment policies. The parties argue whether such a contract existed as well what Defendant's policies entailed.
The evidence shows that Plaintiff signed an official policy statement. (Simmet Decl., Ex. I at 375, 380.) Notably, this written policy statement provides that an employee may be terminated for failing to adhere to professional standards, including a single violation of a Critical Standard. (Id.) Because "the trier of fact can infer an agreement to limit the grounds for termination based on the employee's reasonable reliance on the company's personnel manual or policies," [*21]  this written policy creates a triable issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff reasonably relied upon the policy so as to create an implied contract through which he could be terminated only for failing to adhere to the standards as described in the written policy. See Gil:, 24 Cal. 4th at 344 (quoting Foley, 47 Cal. 3d at 681-82).
Plaintiff contends that Defendant also had a policy of purging write-ups after six months such that they could not be used in future disciplinary actions. (Olvera Decl. ¶ 14; Olvera Decl., Ex. 6; Sosa Decl. ¶ 6-7; Robles Decl. ¶ 5.) Defendant disputes having such a policy. Indeed, this "purge policy" does not appear in the written policy described above. However, there is written evidence showing that such acts were performed in adherence to a company policy or practice. Specifically, Plaintiff's official employment history lists purge dates next to each of his disciplinary actions and includes administrative comments noting that certain actions were deleted because they were over 180 days old. (Olvera Decl., Ex. 6.) Thus, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the purge policy was an official policy or practice, thereby creating a triable issue of fact as to whether Defendant was contractually obligated [*22]  to adhere to it in addition to the written policy above. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 344.
Plaintiff also contends that Defendant had a policy of terminating employees only if they received three write-ups in six months. (Olvera Decl. ¶ 15; Reed Decl. ¶ 11; Sosa Decl. ¶¶ 5-7; Spejo Decl. ¶ 5; Robles Decl. ¶ 5.) Defendant disputes having this policy as well. Plaintiff provides no written evidence of this policy, however, instead relying only on comments made by his supervisors. "The understandings and pronouncements of employees regarding an unwritten company policy or practice . . . generally are not sufficient" to establish those policies as terms of an implied contract. Yen v. Yang Ming (Am.) Corp., No. CV 04-10371 FMC (P.TWx), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46439, 2005 WL 6133905, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 8, 2005) (citing Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 345). In Guz, the court found that a company president's statement that employees could be terminated only for "good reason" was "insufficient as a matter of law" to find that the defendant had thereby contracted away its tight to terminate employees at will. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 345. Likewise, in Davis v. Consolidated Freightways, the court rejected a plaintiffs argument that an informal "progressive discipline" system used by his superiors could impliedly become a pre-requisite to termination. 29 Cal. App. 4th 354, 367, 34 Cal. Rptr. 2d 438 (1994). The court further stated [*23]  that "[o]therwise, an employer would be forced purposely to terminate employees for any and every infraction—or none at all—in order to maintain the presumption of at-will employment. The law does not require such caprice to avoid creating an implied in fact contract." Id. Thus, because Plaintiff provides no written evidence of the "three write-ups policy," he fails to create a triable issue of fact as to whether Defendant was contractually obligated to follow the policy.
Accordingly, although Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to establish a triable issue of fact as to the existence of an implied contract, only the terms of the written policies may apply to such a contract. In other words, while Defendant may have been obligated to terminate employees pursuant to its written policy, including the purge policy, it was not obligated to follow the unwritten three write-ups policy.
2. Whether Defendant Breached the Implied Contract
Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to follow its own policies and thereby breached its implied contract in two ways. First, Defendant terminated Plaintiff even though he had not received three write-ups in one six-month period. Second, Defendant improperly [*24]  used purged write-ups when it decided to terminate him.1
Plaintiff's first argument fails because, as stated above, even if Plaintiff could prove at trial that there was an implied contract, as a matter of law, the unwritten three write-ups policy could not have been a term of the contract. Thus, Defendant could not have breached in this manner because it was never obligated to follow the three write-ups policy.
Plaintiff's second argument fails because Plaintiff has not produced any evidence to show that Defendant considered any of his purged write-ups when it decided to terminate his employment. Instead, the evidence shows that Defendant terminated Plaintiff for violating a Critical Standard on July 17, 2017, which, according to its written policies, provided an independent reason for termination. (Simmet Decl., Ex. I at 380.) Thus, both of Plaintiffs theories for breach of implied contract fail.
3. Whether Defendant Breached the Covenant
Plaintiff restates both of his arguments for breach of implied contract, arguing that Defendant's failure to follow its policies likewise constituted a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As discussed above, both arguments fail. Further, [*25]  even if Plaintiff could prevail on those arguments, "a claim that merely realleges [breach of an implied-in-fact contract term] as a violation of the covenant is superfluous," and should therefore be dismissed. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 352.
Plaintiff additionally argues that Defendant acted in bad faith because Defendant falsely concluded that he violated a Critical Standard on July 17, 2017. Plaintiff does not provide any evidence in support of this claim, however. Instead, Plaintiff simply denies committing the violation and demands that Defendant provide "sufficient undisputed evidence" of the violation. (Opp'n 12, ECF No. 49.) Plaintiff's argument misses the mark. Plaintiff, not Defendant, has the burden of producing material facts to show that Defendant acted in bad faith. See Jensen v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 14 Cal. App. 4th 958, 972, 18 Cal. Rptr. 2d 83 (1993). Simply denying the basis for his termination is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact. Id. at 974. Indeed, "[i]f the employee were entitled to jury trial for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing merely by asserting that the charged misconduct was not true, the decision to terminate would be at the discretion of a jury, not the employer. The law of employment contracts would be turned on its head." Id. (quoting [*26]  Burton v. Sec. Pac. Nat'l Bank, 197 Cal. App. 3d 972, 979, 243 Cal. Rptr. 277 (1988) abrogated on other grounds by Guz, 24 Cal. 4th 317, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089). Thus, Plaintiff's theory for breach of the covenant fails.
Although Plaintiff has demonstrated a triable issue of fact as to whether an implied contract exists, he cannot prevail on either of his claims for breach of the contract or breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment for Defendant on Plaintiff's sixth and seventh claims.

D. Claim 8: Wrongful Termination
To prevail on a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, a plaintiff must establish "that his dismissal violated a public policy that is (1) fundamental, (2) beneficial for the public, and (3) embodied in a statute or constitutional provision." Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994).
Plaintiff does not identify a violation of a policy or statute separate from his age and disability discrimination claims under FEHA. As discussed above, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on both of Plaintiff's discrimination claims. Thus, Plaintiff fails to provide any basis for his wrongful termination claim.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment for Defendant on Plaintiff's eighth claim for wrongful termination.

VI. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the [*27]  Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. Judgment will be entered dismissing this action with prejudice.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
