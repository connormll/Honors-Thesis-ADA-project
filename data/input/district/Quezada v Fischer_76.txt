ORDER AND REPORT-RECOMMENDATION

I. INTRODUCTION
Pro se Plaintiff Jose Quezada commenced this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131, et seq. ("ADA"), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §794(a) ("RA") on May 7, 2013, in the Southern District of New York. Following transfer of the case to the Northern District of New York, the Hon. Mae A. D'Agostino issued a Decision and Order severing and transferring the claims against twenty Defendants and claims relating to Green Haven Correctional Facility ("Green Haven") back to the Southern District of New York, and retaining the remaining seventeen Defendants and the claims asserted against them in the Northern District of New York. (Dkt. No. 38.)
Subsequent to the transfer, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint against the Northern District Defendants (Dkt. No. 111), who thereafter filed a motion to dismiss in [*2]  part for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. No. 116.) On March 22, 2016, Judge D'Agostino filed an Order (Dkt. No. 143) adopting this Court's Report-Recommendation on the partial motion to dismiss. (Dkt. No. 140.)
The Defendants remaining in the case after Judge D'Agostino's Order are Eric Gutwein, Donnie C. Riley, Daniel King, S. Brown, John Cross, J. Monacelli, Rosanna Lordi, William Chase, Ronald Laroque, Andrew Bouchey, Andrew Streeter, T. Brousseau, R. Lee, and S. Beaudette. (Dkt. No. 143 at 2.1) The remaining claims are Plaintiff's: (1) Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claim against Gutwein; (2) Eighth Amendment excessive force claims against Monacelli, Laroque, Chase, King, Bouchey, and Streeter, and failure to intervene claim against Riley; (3) First Amendment retaliation claims against Defendants Brousseau, Brown, Cross, Lee, and Beaudette; (4) Eighth Amendment medical indifference claims against Lordi and Cross; (5) Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim against Beaudette; (6) ADA and RA claims against Cross in his official capacity; and (7) an Eighth Amendment sexual assault claim against Lee. (See generally Dkt. Nos. 140 and 143.)
Now before the Court for review and recommendation is the remaining Defendants' motion for summary judgment pursuant [*3]  to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. No. 157.) Plaintiff has responded in opposition to the motion. (Dkt. Nos. 178, 179, and 188.) For reasons explained below, the Court recommends that Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 157) be granted in part and denied in part.
Because Plaintiff's second amended complaint (Dkt. No. 111) includes numerous, disparate claims against a number of Defendants, the facts relevant to each claim on which Defendants seek judgment will be set forth with the Court's analysis of that claim.

II. APPLICABLE SUMMARY JUDGMENT LEGAL STANDARDS
Summary judgment may be granted only if the submissions of the parties taken together "show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202, (1986). The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of showing, through the production of admissible evidence, that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 272-73 (2d Cir. 2006). A dispute of fact is "genuine" if "the [record] evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
Only after the moving party has met this burden is the nonmoving party required to produce evidence demonstrating [*4]  that genuine issues of material fact exist. Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 273. The nonmoving party must do more than "rest upon the mere allegations . . . of the [plaintiff's] pleading" or "simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-86, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). "Conclusory allegations, conjecture and speculation . . . are insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact." Kerzer v. Kingly Mfg., 156 F.3d 396, 400 (2d Cir. 1998).
A party opposing summary judgment is required to submit admissible evidence. See Spiegel v. Schulmann, 604 F.3d 72, 81 (2d Cir. 2010) ("It is well established that in determining the appropriateness of a grant of summary judgment, [the court] . . . may rely only on admissible evidence.") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A plaintiff's verified complaint is to be treated as an affidavit.2 Colon v. Coughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 872 (2d Cir. 1995) ("A verified complaint is to be treated as an affidavit . . . and therefore will be considered in determining whether material issues of fact exist . . . .") (citations omitted).
In Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 554 (2d Cir. 2005), the Second Circuit reminded that on summary judgment motions "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff." "To defeat summary judgment, . . . nonmoving parties may not rely [*5]  on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation." Jeffreys, 426 F.3d at 554 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "At the summary judgment stage, a nonmoving party must offer some hard evidence showing that its version of the events is not wholly fanciful." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "[T]o satisfy Rule 56(e), affidavits must be based upon 'concrete particulars,' not conclusory allegations. "Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118 F.3d 106, 111 (2d Cir. 1997) (citation omitted). "Statements that are devoid of any specifics, but replete with conclusions, are insufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment." Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 452 (2d Cir. 1999).
In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party. Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 309 (2d Cir. 2008). Where a party is proceeding pro se, the court is obliged to "read [the pro se party's] supporting papers liberally, and . . . interpret them to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest." Burgos v. Hopkins, 14 F.3d 787, 790 (2d Cir. 1994). However, "a pro se party's 'bald assertion,' unsupported by evidence, is not sufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment." Cole v. Artuz, No. 93 Civ. 5981 (WHP) (JCF), 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16832, 1999 WL 983876 at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 28, 1999)3 (citing Carey v. Crescenzi, 923 F.2d 18, 21 (2d Cir. 1991)).
In applying the summary judgment standard, the district court should not weigh evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses. [*6]  Hayes v. New York City Dep't of Corr., 84 F.3d 614, 619 (2d Cir. 1996); Rule v. Brine, Inc., 85 F.3d 1002, 1011 (2d Cir. 1996) (credibility issues which are questions of fact for resolution by a jury, are inappropriately decided by a court on a motion for summary judgment).

III. PLAINTIFF'S FAILURE TO COMPLY FULLY WITH N.D.N.Y. L.R. 7.1(a)(3)
While courts are required to give due deference to a plaintiff's pro se status, that status "does not relieve [a pro se] plaintiff of his duty to meet the requirements necessary to defeat a motion for summary judgment." Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony Records, 351 F.3d 46, 50 (2d Cir. 2003). In opposing Defendants' summary judgment motion, Plaintiff failed to respond to the Statement of Material Facts filed by Defendants in the manner required under N.D.N.Y. L.R. 7.1(a)(3) by neglecting to set forth a specific citation to the record in numerous instances where he "disagreed" with Defendants' individually numbered statements of undisputed facts.4 (See Dkt. Nos. 157-1 and 178.)
Where, as in this case, a party has failed to respond to the movant's statement of material facts in the manner required under N.D.N.Y. L.R. 7.1(a)(3), the facts in the movant's statement to which Plaintiff has not properly responded will be accepted as true (1) to the extent they are supported by evidence in the record,5 and (2) the nonmovant, if proceeding pro se, has been specifically advised of the possible [*7]  consequences of failing to respond to the motion.6 See Champion, v. Artuz, 76 F.3d 483, 486 (2d Cir. 1996). However, the Second Circuit, acknowledging a court's broad discretion to determine whether to overlook a failure to comply with local rules, has held that "while a court is not required to consider what the parties fail to point out in their [local rule statements of material facts], it may in its discretion opt to conduct an assiduous review of the entire record even where one of the parties has failed to file such a statement." Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., Inc., 258 F.3d 62, 73 (2d Cir. 2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In deference to Plaintiff's pro se status and the degree of effort he clearly put into his response to Defendants' statement of material facts, the Court has opted to review the entire record in determining if there are material facts in dispute.

IV. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS CLAIM AGAINST GUTWEIN

A. May 17, 2011, Inmate Misbehavior Report and Tier III Disciplinary Hearing
Defendant Eric Gutwein is a Commissioner's Hearing Officer ("CHO") with the New York State [*8]  Department of Corrections and Community Supervision ("DOCCS") (Dkt. Nos. 157-7 at 101.) Gutwein was the CHO at the Tier III disciplinary hearing on a May 17, 2011, Inmate Misbehavior Report ("IMR") issued to Plaintiff by Green Haven Correctional Officer ("C.O.") MacIsaac.7 Id. at 19, 101. According to the IMR, on May 16, 2011, when MacIsaac went to Plaintiff's cell to pack his things for transfer, Plaintiff began violently attacking him with a razor blade and failed to comply with several direct orders to drop the weapon. Id. at 19. MacIsaac sustained two lacerations on his arm, requiring twenty stitches, and smaller lacerations on his face. Id. at 135.
Plaintiff was charged with violation of 100.11 assault on staff, 113.10 weapon, 106.10 direct order, 107.10 interference, and 104.11 violent conduct. Id. Plaintiff has denied attacking MacIsaac, claiming that MacIsaac, against whom Plaintiff had filed grievances and complaints, cut himself so he could blame Plaintiff, and it was Plaintiff who was assaulted on May 16, 2011.8 (Dkt. Nos. 157-2 at 304; 157-7 at 138, 141, 162-63, 187.) Plaintiff's disciplinary hearing, which began on May 26, 2011, was held at Shawangunk Correctional Facility ("Shawangunk"), and Plaintiff was provided [*9]  with a Spanish translator, Correctional Counselor, Mary Robles. Id. Plaintiff plead not guilty to all of the charges. Id. at 103-04.
The hearing ended on June 17, 2011, following the testimony of numerous witnesses and submission of documentary evidence. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at 101-94.) Gutwein found Plaintiff guilty on all of the charges and imposed a penalty of sixty months in the Special Housing Unit ("SHU"); sixty months recommended loss of good time; and sixty months loss of packages, commissary, and phone. Id. at 75, 192-93. A copy of the disposition was given to Plaintiff in both English and Spanish. Id. at 75-88. Plaintiff appealed from the disposition on July 16, 2011. (Dkt. [*10]  No. 179-6 at 10.) The disposition was affirmed by the DOCCS Commissioner on August 4, 2011. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at 28.)

B. Article 78
After the disposition was affirmed, Plaintiff brought a proceeding under N.Y. CPLR Article 78 in New York State Supreme Court for review of the Commissioner's determination. The proceeding was transferred to the Appellate Division, Third Department by the Albany County Supreme Court. See Quezada v. Fischer, 113 A.D.3d 1004, 979 N.Y.S.2d 426, 427 (N.Y. App. Div. 2014). In his brief submitted in the Article 78 proceeding, Plaintiff specifically challenged: (1) Gutwein's denial of thirty-four witnesses requested by Plaintiff with no reason and failure to determine why requested witnesses had refused to testify (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 306-09); (2) violation of Plaintiff's right to assistance in preparation of his defense where his assigned assistant failed to seek out and interview witnesses and assist Plaintiff in marshaling the documentary evidence necessary to his defense, id. at 325-27; (3) bias on the part of Gutwein as CHO, id. at 328-30; (4) insufficient notice in the IMR of the facts upon which the charges were based, id. at 331-32; and (5) imposition of a sentence that was unduly harsh and grossly disproportionate to the charges against him. Id. at 336-37; Dkt. No. 179-1 at P 59.
The Appellate Division, [*11]  Third Department, finding that "the misbehavior report and related documentation, together with the testimony adduced at the hearing, provided substantial evidence supporting the determination of guilt," confirmed the Commissioner's determination and dismissed Plaintiff's petition. Quezada, 979 N.Y.S.2d at 427-28. In its Opinion, the Third Department found that Plaintiff's claims that the IMR was prepared in retaliation for grievance and complaints filed by him, MacIsaac's injuries were self-inflicted, and it was Plaintiff who was assaulted by the officers, all presented credibility issues for resolution by the Hearing Officer. Id. at 427. The Court concluded that the IMR was sufficiently detailed to provide Plaintiff with adequate notice of the charges to enable him to prepare a defense. Id. In addition, the Court, finding that there was no evidence that Gutwein was biased or that the determination flowed from any alleged bias, also rejected Plaintiff's claim that he was denied a fair hearing. Id. at 427-28. The Third Department found Plaintiff's other contentions properly before the Court, including his challenge to the penalty imposed by Gutwein, to be unpersuasive.9 Id. at 428.

C. Facts Relevant to Plaintiff's Section 1983 Procedural Due Process [*12]  Claim
In this lawsuit, Plaintiff claims Gutwein violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process in connection with the June 17, 2011, disciplinary hearing by: (1) providing insufficient of the notice of the charges; (2) failing to provide Plaintiff with his hearing aids for the hearing; (3) denying witnesses and documentary evidence requested by Plaintiff; (4) denying Plaintiff the right to adequate assistance in the preparation of his defense; and (5) acting in a biased manner. (Dkt. No. 111 at 48-54; 179 at 43-45.)
1. Notice of the Charges
The IMR included the date, location, and time of the incident, along with a description of the incident and the charges against Plaintiff. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at 19.) Plaintiff acknowledged the IMR was provided to him in English on May 18, 2011, and in Spanish on May 20, 2011. (Dkt. No. 111 at PP 132, 134.)
2. Plaintiff's Hearing Aids
Plaintiff is hearing impaired. (Dkt. No. 111 at P 138.) Plaintiff has alleged in his second amended complaint that he objected to not being provided with his hearing aids for the disciplinary hearing. Id. According to Gutwein, Plaintiff spoke and responded to questions from him throughout the proceeding with no apparent difficulty. (Dkt. [*13]  No. 157-7 at 15.) Gutwein did not notice any instance where Plaintiff was unable to hear or be heard during the testimony, and Plaintiff responded to his questions, listened to the testimony of witnesses, and asked questions of witnesses without any apparent difficulty. Id. Plaintiff has disagreed with Gutwein's assessment, claiming that because he did not have his hearing aids he had no choice but to try to read Gutwein's lips and listen to the "couple questions he asked Plaintiff." (Dkt. No. 178 at P 163.)
3. Plaintiff's Witness Requests
Plaintiff requested the testimony of approximately thirty-four witnesses at the hearing, the majority of whom he wanted to testify regarding his troubled history with MacIsaac and others prior to the May 16, 2011, incident, complaints he had made to requested witnesses about MacIsaac, and his fear that MacIsaac and others at Green Haven were going to kill him. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at PP 139-141; 157-7 at 111-117; 179-1 at P 5.) Gutwein questioned Plaintiff at length at the beginning of the hearing regarding why he wanted the various witnesses on his list, including those whom Plaintiff wanted to testify with regard to his history with MacIsaac, and Plaintiff's [*14]  expressions of fear and concern regarding his safety. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at 34-47; 111-119.)
The witnesses Plaintiff requested before and during the hearing ranged from DOCCS officers to whom Plaintiff had complained or asked for assistance; Plaintiff's lawyer and doctors, including his psychiatrist and the Office of Mental Health Unit Chief; inmates who had helped him with legal work; inmates who had seen him being harassed; the Muslim, Protestant, and Catholic Chaplains at Green Haven; correctional counselors; the Dutchess County Clerk and District Attorney; State Police and FBI employees; and inmates who were housed or present near his cell at the time of the May 16, 2011, incident. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at P 34 and pp. 7-9, 34, 47, 111-119, 167-68.) Plaintiff informed Gutwein that many of the requested witnesses would be able to testify Plaintiff had complained of and expressed fear regarding MacIsaac and others, and had sought protection from them over a period of years. Id. at 111-119. Some could testify Plaintiff had told them if anything happened to him MacIsaac would be one of those responsible. Id.
A number of inmate witnesses requested by Plaintiff refused to testify. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at 62-73.) [*15]  On the Requested Inmate Witness Refusal to Testify form, some inmates provided reasons why they would not testify and signed the form. Id. at 62-64. Others provided no information and refused to sign the form. Id. at 65-66, 72.
According to Gutwein, he diligently considered each of the witnesses requested by Plaintiff and rejected most of them on relevance grounds.10 Id. at P 35. Gutwein found that the requests had no relevance because the testimony sought concerned alleged prior complaints or conversations that were unrelated to the incident on May 16, 2011. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at P 35.) Inmate Paul Bridgefourth was allowed to testify regarding hearing Sgt. Surber call Plaintiff a bitch and tell him he should have come to her before writing something up, and Plaintiff telling Bridgefourth that he felt that his life was being threatened and he was afraid something was going to happen to him. Id. at 150-52. In addition, C.O. Bielefieldt, C.O. MacIsaac, and C.O. Filliponi testified at Plaintiff's request either via speaker phone or in person at the hearing. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at P 35.) C.O. McDonough, Sgt. Alexander, Inmate Pena, and an Office of Mental Health staff member testified at the hearing at Gutwein's request. (Dkt. No. 157-1 at P 154.) [*16] 
4. Documents and Other Evidence Requested By Plaintiff During the Hearing
During the course of the hearing, Plaintiff requested the MacIsaac medical report on his lacerations, fingerprints from the razor blade weapon, photographs of his cell, a log book entry, and a videotape of his cell. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at P 36.) Gutwein denied the medical records request based upon policy precluding inmates from possessing staff medical records on privacy and security considerations. Id. at P 37. He denied the fingerprint request because DOCCS does not have the capability to perform fingerprinting. Id. Plaintiff's request for photographs of his cell was denied because there were no pictures relating to the May 16, 2011, incident other than those shown Plaintiff during the course of the hearing. Id. The log book entry was denied due to lack of relevance and the video tape of Plaintiff's cell was denied because it was determined that no such video existed. Id. at 14.
Plaintiff was, however, allowed to introduce documents such as correspondence with the New York State Police, Dutchess County District Attorney, the FBI, Department of Justice, and letters/complaints he had sent to DOCCS officials, counselors and chaplains, [*17]  some dating back as far as 2006, concerning problems with MacIsaac, fear for his safety, and requests for protection. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at 165-67.)
5. Assistance in the Preparation of his Defense
On May 20, 2011, Plaintiff chose Robles as his assistant for the June 17, 2011, hearing. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at 97.) The Assistant Form from the Disciplinary Office advising Robles she had been selected to assist Plaintiff was completed and signed by her on May 25, 2011. (Dkt. No. 11-2 at 108.) Plaintiff refused to sign the form. Id. The completed form indicated that Plaintiff had requested Robles interview inmates Rawling and Rodriguez and both had refused to testify at his hearing. Id. According to the form, Plaintiff had also asked Robles to find out whether anyone else signed the IMR (answered no), to obtain a videotape of Plaintiff being escorted from his cell to SHU (indicated it would be at the hearing), a photograph of Plaintiff (would ask at the hearing), to speak to Plaintiff's attorney (no time), to obtain a recording of the 911 call (does not exist), and to obtain a copy of a videotape of the State Police (illegible). Id. The form indicates that Plaintiff had requested and Robles had obtained [*18]  copies of the Unusual Incident Report, Use of Force Report, and the To-Froms. Id.
Plaintiff claims that his right to assistance was violated because Robles failed to provide and produce documents related to his retaliation defense, failed to interview the witnesses on his list, and failed to inform him of the results of her investigation. (Dkt. No. 111 at P 156.) At his deposition, Plaintiff testified that he had given Robles a list of more than thirty witnesses he wanted her to interview, including from the Inspector General's Office, a New York State Police Captain who had been asked to interview MacIsaac, the Dutchess County DA, and someone from the State Police Office, who had been at Green Haven on the day of the incident. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 140-148.) According to Plaintiff, Robles never talked to his proposed witnesses and never came back to him to report whether she had found the proposed witnesses and whether they had refused to testify, thereby keeping him in limbo. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 151.)
Plaintiff also testified that he had asked Robles to obtain documents including MacIsaac's medical records, injury reports, and photographs of MacIsaac and Plaintiff's injuries, and contrary [*19]  to the Assistant Form, she had given him nothing. Id. at 160-61.
6. Claimed Bias on the Part of Gutwein
In his second amended complaint, Plaintiff has alleged that Gutwein was biased and refused to consider the merits of Plaintiff' evidence and defense. (Dkt. No. 111 at P 156.) In addition, Plaintiff complains that Gutwein disallowed Plaintiff's witnesses and never informed him as to why he was not going to allow the witnesses he had requested until the end of the hearing. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 151.) Plaintiff has also claimed that the penalty imposed by Gutwein was unduly harsh. Id.

D. Due Process Rights in a Prison Disciplinary Hearing
A prison inmate may not properly be deprived of a cognizable liberty interest without due process of law. See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555-56, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1974). A prison disciplinary hearing implicates a protected liberty interest if it imposes an "atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life."11 Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S. Ct. 2293, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1995); see also Palmer v. Richards, 364 F.3d 60, 64 (2d Cir. 2004).
It is well-established that "[t]he due process protections afforded a prison inmate do not equate to 'the full panoply of rights' due to a defendant in a criminal prosecution." Sira v. Morton, 380 F.3d 57, 69 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Wolff, 418 U.S. at 556). The Supreme Court explained in Wolff that
[p]rison disciplinary proceedings [*20]  . . . take place in a closed, tightly controlled environment peopled by those who have chosen to violate the criminal law and who have been lawfully incarcerated for doing so. Some . . . have repeatedly employed illegal and often very violent means to attain their ends . . . [and] may have little regard for the safety of others or their property or for the rules designed to provide an orderly and reasonably safe prison life. . . . Guards and inmates co-exist in direct and intimate contact. Tension between them is unremitting. Frustration, resentment, and despair are commonplace. Relationships among the inmates are varied and complex and perhaps subject to the unwritten code that exhorts inmates not to inform on a fellow prisoner.
It is against [that] background that disciplinary proceedings must be structured by prison authorities; and it is against [that] background that we must make our constitutional judgments. . . .
418 U.S. at 561-62. To comply with procedural due process, prison authorities must provide an inmate charged with a violation in a disciplinary hearing with: (1) written notice of the charges; (2) the opportunity to appear and be heard at a disciplinary hearing and to present witnesses [*21]  and evidence subject to legitimate safety and penological concerns; (3) a limited right to assistance in preparing a defense; and (4) a written statement from the hearing officer explaining his or her decision, and the reasons for the actions taken. Id. at 564-71.
A prison inmate is also entitled to a fair and impartial hearing officer, Sira, 380 F.3d at 69, and to a determination that is supported by "some evidence" in the record. Superintendent v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 455, 105 S. Ct. 2768, 86 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1985) (ascertaining whether the "some evidence" standard is satisfied, "does not require examination of the entire record, independent assessment of witness' credibility, or weighing of the evidence. . . . Instead, the relevant question is whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by the disciplinary board."). The Second Circuit has held that "only reliable evidence can constitute 'some evidence.'" Sira, 380 F.3d at 76 (quoting Luna v. Pico, 356 F.3d 481, 488 (2d Cir. 2004)).
In his second amended complaint, Plaintiff claims he was denied the following Wolff due process protections in the disciplinary hearing before Gutwein: (1) use of his hearing aids; (2) sufficient notice regarding the charges against him in the IMR; (3) the opportunity to present relevant witnesses; and (4) his right to adequate assistance by his [*22]  assistant in interviewing witnesses and collecting and presenting evidence. (See generally Dkt. Nos. 111 at PP 139-42; pp. 148.12) Plaintiff also claims that Gutwein was unfair and biased against Plaintiff in the handling of the disciplinary hearing. Id.

E. Grounds for Summary Judgment Asserted by Gutwein
1. Peralta Bar
Gutwein contends that under Peralta v. Vasquez, 467 F.3d 98 (2d Cir. 2006), Plaintiff is prohibited from pursuing his § 1983 due process claim because Plaintiff's disciplinary hearing on the May 17, 2011, IMR resulted in "mixed sanctions" affecting both the duration and conditions of his confinement. (Dkt. No. 157-14 at 28-30.) Under the Second Circuit's holding in Peralta, where a prisoner is subject to mixed sanctions he can proceed separately under § 1983 with conditions of confinement claims without satisfying the favorable termination rule under Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1994), which was made applicable to § 1983 claims involving disciplinary proceedings in Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 117 S. Ct. 1584, 137 L. Ed. 2d 906 (1997). Peralta, 467 F.3d at 103. However, he can only do so "if he is willing to forgo once and for all any challenge to any sanctions that affect the duration of his confinement. In other words the prisoner must abandon, not just now, but also in any future proceeding, any claims he may have with respect to the duration of his confinement [*23]  that arise out of the proceeding he is attacking in his current § 1983 suit." Id. at 104. (emphasis in original).
In his declaration in opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff has included the following written waiver: "Plaintiff waive and forever abandon any legal claims he has or may have with respect to the loss of good time stemming from the June 17, 2011, disciplinary hearing." (Dkt. No. 179-1 at P 61.) Based upon Plaintiff's written waiver, the Court recommends that Gutwein be denied summary judgment under Peralta.
2. Collateral Estoppel
"Under the Full Faith and Credit Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, federal courts must give a prior state court judgment the same preclusive effect that such a judgment would be given in the courts of the state from which the judgment emerged." Giakoumelos v. Coughlin, 88 F.3d 56, 59 (2d Cir. 1996) (citing Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 466, 102 S. Ct. 1883, 72 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1982)). The rule applies fully to civil rights actions brought pursuant to § 1983. Id. Inasmuch as the state court judgment in Plaintiff's Article 78 proceeding was rendered in New York State, the Court must look to New York law to determine any preclusive effect the prior judgment in the Article 78 proceeding has in this case. Id.
"New York courts apply collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, 'if the issue in the second action is identical [*24]  to an issue which was raised, necessarily decided and material in the first action, and the plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the earlier action." LaFleur v. Whitman, 300 F.3d 256, 271 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Parker v. Blauvelt Volunteer Fire Co., 93 N.Y.2d 343, 712 N.E.2d 647, 690 N.Y.S. 2d 478, 483 (1999)). The burden of proving the issues raised and necessarily decided in the previous proceeding are the same "rests squarely on the party moving for preclusion." La Fleur, 300 F.3d at 272. The burden of proving the absence of a full and fair opportunity to litigate the claims rests with the party opposing the application of collateral estoppel. See Giakoumelos, 88 F.3d at 59 (citing Schwartz v. Public Adm'r of County of Bronx, 24 N.Y.2d 65, 246 N.E.2d 725, 298 N.Y.S.2d 955, 960 (1969)).
The Court finds Defendants have established the claims Plaintiff has asserted in this action with regard to: (1) sufficiency of notice of the charges against him in the IMR (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 19); (2) Gutwein's denial of thirty-four witnesses requested by Plaintiff with no reason and failure to determine why requested witnesses had refused to testify (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 306-09); (3) violation of Plaintiff's right to assistance in the preparation of his defense where his assigned assistant failed to seek out and interview witnesses and assist Plaintiff in marshaling the documentary evidence necessary to his defense, id. at 325-27; and (4) bias on the part of Gutwein as CHO, id. at 328-30, are the [*25]  same issues raised and necessarily decided, and material in Plaintiff's Article 78 proceeding. See LaFleur, 300 F.3d at 271.
The failure of the Third Department to directly address the claims made by Plaintiff regarding denial of witnesses and the lack assistance in his defense in its Opinion in no way renders collateral estoppel inapplicable. As noted above, in its Opinion, the Court made clear it had "considered petitioner's many other contentions . . . and [found] them unpersuasive." See Quezada v. Fischer, 113 A.D.3d 1004, 979 N.Y.S.2d 426. The Second Circuit, in determining the applicability of collateral estoppel in Winters v. Lavine, 574 F.2d 46 (2d Cir. 1978), reasoned that:
It is not significant, moreover, that the Appellate Division's opinion does not allude to the constitutional issue which [petitioner] had clearly submitted to the court for resolution, for, as appellant concedes, it is entirely possible for a court to consider and reject a particular claim presented to it without any express discussion or allusion to that claim. Indeed, on two recent occasions we have emphasized this very point. "The silence of the (court's) opinion on the constitutional issue is of course immaterial." Tang v. Appellate Division, [First Dept.], 487 F.2d [138], 141 n.2 [2d Cir. 1973]; accord, Lecci v. Cahn F.2d 826, 830 (2d Cir. 1974) ("The fact that the affirmances of the state [*26]  courts were without opinion or without specific reference to the constitutional question is of course immaterial.")
Id. at 60-61. The unaddressed issues must, however, have been necessary to the determination of the action. Id. at 60. The Court finds that they were necessary to the state court determination.
Plaintiff contends he was denied a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues he raised in the Article 78 proceeding because: (1) he had attempted unsuccessfully to withdraw his Article 78 petition because medical problems were making it difficult for him to proceed in a timely manner; and (2) he did not learn that the Third Department had returned his reply brief with instructions to reduce the number of pages to comply with court rules and refile until it was too late to refile in a timely manner. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at PP 318-330; 179-1 at PP 58-61.)
Plaintiff wrote a series of letters to the Clerk of the Third Department in September 2012 requesting permission to withdraw his petition without prejudice due to health problems. (Dkt. No. 111-7 at 142-44.) Rather than allow Plaintiff to withdraw his petition without prejudice, the Third Department granted Plaintiff the alternative relief of an extension [*27]  of time to perfect the proceeding. Id. at 146. The Clerk's Office sent Plaintiff motion forms in case he needed to request a further extension on March 5, 2013. Id. at 145. Plaintiff's brief was sent for filing on March 25, 2013. Id. at 150.
Plaintiff has the burden of proving the absence of a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claims in the Article 78 proceeding. See Giakoumelos, 88 F.3d at 59. The Court finds that inasmuch as Plaintiff was given extra time to perfect the proceeding after informing the Third Department of his health problems, and he was able to file a substantial Petitioner's brief (Dkt. No. 157-2), albeit one including some claims not properly before the Court for review on an Article 78, the Court's denial of his request to withdraw his petition without prejudice did not deprive him of a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues he had raised. Moreover, the reply brief that was not filed in time for consideration by the Court addressed the same issues as those addressed in Plaintiff's initial brief.13 (Dkt. No. 157-2.) Finally, Plaintiff has failed to show the alleged deficiencies in his disciplinary proceeding "produced some significant effect on their review by the Appellate Division in the Article 78 Proceeding," particularly inasmuch [*28]  as the record from the disciplinary hearing provided the Appellate Division with notice of Plaintiff's defense even though most of his witnesses were denied on relevance grounds. See Giakoumelos, 88 F.3d at 60.
Based upon the foregoing, the Court recommends Plaintiff be collaterally estopped from relitigating the following claims against Gutwein in this § 1983 action: (1) sufficiency of notice of the charges against him; (2) denial of requested witnesses at his disciplinary hearing; (3) violation of his right to assistance in the preparation of his defense; and (4) bias on the part of Gutwein. Because it is not clear to the Court from the summary judgment record that Plaintiff's claims that Gutwein deprived him of use of his hearing aids at the hearing, and denied Plaintiff documentary evidence he requested at the hearing were raised and necessarily decided in the Article 78, the Court recommends that Plaintiff not be collaterally estopped from litigating his procedural due process claim as to those issues.
3. Plaintiff's Hearing Aids and Documentary Evidence Claims
Having recommended that Plaintiff not be collaterally estopped from litigating his hearing aids and documentary evidence claims, the Court is left to consider [*29]  whether Gutwein is entitled to summary judgment on those claims on the merits.
Under Wolff, 418 U.S. at 564-71, Gutwein was required to provide Plaintiff with the opportunity to appear and be heard at his disciplinary hearing. Plaintiff has alleged in conclusory fashion that he objected he was not provided with his hearing aids for the disciplinary hearing. (Dkt. No. 111 at P 138.) Plaintiff has provided no factual detail regarding his hearing aid claim, other than writing in his reply brief submitted and rejected in the Article 78, that on May 25, 2011, after telling Gutwein for the second time he did not understand what Gutwein was saying, Plaintiff told the interpreter he was hearing impaired and used hearing aids in both ears. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 425.) There is nothing in the transcript and no other non-conclusory evidence in the record indicating that the lack of hearings aids was an issue throughout the hearing or that it affected the outcome of the hearing. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at 101-194.) Plaintiff engaged in back and forth with Gutwein and asked questions of witnesses throughout the hearing without any problem in hearing and understanding that would suggest he was prevented from fully participating in the [*30]  hearing apparent from the transcript. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at 101-194.)
The evidence in the summary judgment record also fails to support Plaintiff's claim that Gutwein denied his right to procedural due process by failing to provide him with documents and things relevant to his defense. As noted above, certain evidence requested by Plaintiff did not exist, i.e., fingerprints, videos, and photographs. (Dkt. No. 157-7 at ¶ 37.) Evidence denied by Gutwein was found to be subject to privacy rules or not relevant, i.e., MacIsaac's medical records and a log book. Id. Moreover, Plaintiff's assistant obtained copies of the Unusual Incident Report, Use of Force Report, and the To-From. (Dkt. No. 111-2 at 108.)
In order to establish a procedural due process claim in connection with a prison disciplinary hearing, an inmate must show he was prejudiced by the alleged procedural errors, in the sense that the errors affected the outcome of the hearing. See Powell v. Coughlin, 953 F.2d 744, 750 (2d Cir. 1991) ("[I]t is entirely inappropriate to overturn the outcome of a prison disciplinary proceeding because of a procedural error without making the normal appellate assessment as to whether the error was harmless or prejudicial."); Clark v. Danheim, 590 F.Supp. 2d 426, 429-31 (W.D.N.Y. 2008) ("[t]o establish a procedural [*31]  due process claim in connection with a prison disciplinary hearing, an inmate must show that he was prejudiced by the alleged procedural errors, in the sense that the errors affected the outcome of the hearing").
The Court finds Plaintiff has failed to show he was prejudiced by not having his hearing aids at the disciplinary hearing, and to the extent, if at all, Plaintiff was deprived of relevant documents and things at the hearing, Plaintiff has failed to show prejudice as a result of the deprivation. Inasmuch as the hearing aid and documentary evidence claims are the only procedural due process claims raised by Plaintiff that are not barred by collateral estoppel, the Court recommends Gutwein be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment due process claim against him.

V. EXHAUSTION OF PLAINTIFF'S EIGHTH AMENDMENT EXCESSIVE FORCE, ENCOURAGING THE USE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE, FAILURE TO PROTECT, AND MEDICAL INDIFFERENCE CLAIMS
Defendants Upstate Correctional Facility ("Upstate") Sergeants Chase, Riley, Monacelli, and King, Correctional Officers Laroque, Bouchey, and Streeter, and Registered Nurse ("RN") Lordi, seek summary judgment for failure to exhaust with respect to Plaintiff's § 1983 claims for use of excessive [*32]  force, encouragement of the use of excessive force, failure to protect, and medical indifference in violation of Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment which allegedly occurred on July 21 and 22, 2011. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 1-37, 157-176; 157-14 at 4-11.) For reasons described below, the Court recommends that the Defendants' motion be denied.

A. Legal Standard for Exhaustion Under the PLRA
Under the PLRA, "[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 . . . by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted." 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); see Ross v. Blake,     U.S.    , 136 S.Ct. 1850, 1856, 195 L. Ed. 2d 117 (2016). "[T]he PLRA's exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong." Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532, 122 S. Ct. 983, 152 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2002).
The PLRA requires "proper exhaustion," which means using all steps required by the administrative review process applicable to the institution in which an inmate is confined and doing so properly. Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007) (citing Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 88, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 165 L. Ed. 2d 368 (2006)). See also Amador v. Andrews, 655 F.3d 89, 96 (2d Cir. 2011) (exhaustion necessitates "using all steps that the [government] agency holds out, and doing so properly").
In New York [*33]  state prisons, DOCCS has a well-established three-step Inmate Grievance Program ("IGP"). N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. ("NYCRR") tit. 7, § 701.5 (2013). Generally, the DOCCS IGP involves the following procedure for the filing of grievances. First, an inmate must file a complaint with the facility's IGP clerk within twenty-one calendar days of the alleged occurrence. Id. at § 701.5(a) (2010). A representative of the facility's Inmate Grievance Resolution Committee ("IGRC") has sixteen calendar days from receipt of the grievance to informally resolve the issue. Id. at § 701.5(b)(1). If there is no such informal resolution, the full IGRC conducts a hearing within sixteen calendar days of receipt of the grievance (id. at § 701.5(b)(2)), and issues a written decision within two working days of the conclusion of the hearing. Id. at § 701.5(c)(3)(1).
Second, a grievant may appeal the IGRC decision to the facility's superintendent within seven calendar days of receipt of the IGRC's written decision. Id. at § 701.5(c)(1). If the grievance involves an institutional issue (as opposed to a DOCCS-wide policy issue), the superintendent must issue a written decision within twenty calendar days of receipt of the grievant's appeal. Id. at § 701.5(c)(3)(ii). Grievances regarding DOCCS-wide [*34]  policy issues are forwarded directly to the Central Office Review Committee ("CORC") for a decision under the process applicable to the third step. Id. at § 701.5(c)(3)(i). Third, a grievant may appeal to CORC within seven working days of receipt of the superintendent's written decision. Id. at § 701.5(d)(1)(i). CORC is to render a written decision within thirty calendar days of receipt of the appeal. Id. at § 701.5(d)(3)(ii). If the IGRC or superintendent fail to timely respond to a grievance or first-level appeal, the grievant can and must appeal to the next level, including to CORC to complete the grievance process. Id., at § 701.6(g); see also Murray v. Palmer, No. 9:03-CV-1010 (GTS/GHL), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32014, 2010 WL 1235591, at * 2 & n.4 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2010) (collecting cases).
Grievances claiming employee harassment "are of particular concern to the administrators of [DOCCS] facilities," and are subject to an expedited procedure whereby the grievance goes directly to the facility superintendent.14 Id. at § 701.8. The grievant still must follow the procedures in § 701.5(a) by filing the grievance with the clerk of the IGRC. Id. at § 701.8(a). The grievance is to be given a grievance calendar number and recorded in sequence with all other grievances and must be forwarded to the superintendent by the close of the business day. [*35]  Id. at § 701.8(b). The superintendent is required to initiate an in-house investigation by higher ranking supervisory personnel; request an investigation by the inspector general's office; or request an investigation by the New York State Police Bureau of Investigation if he determines that criminal activity may be involved. Id. at 701.8(d). A grievance referred to the superintendent and determined to be an allegation of harassment, may not be withdrawn and must be addressed by the superintendent. Id. at 701.8(e). The superintendent is required to render a decision on the grievance within twenty-five calendar days, and extensions may be granted only with the consent of the grievant. Id. at § 701.8(f). If the superintendent fails to respond within the required twenty-five days, the grievant may appeal the grievance to CORC by "filing a notice of decision to appeal (form #2133) with the inmate grievance clerk." Id. at § 701.8(g).
If a prisoner has failed to properly follow each of the applicable steps, including receipt of a decision from CORC, prior to commencing litigation, he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and is barred from commencing a federal lawsuit. Woodford, 548 U.S. at 93; Neal v. Goord, 267 F.3d 116, 122-23 (2d Cir. 2001) (inmate commencing litigation [*36]  before receiving a decision from CORC does not satisfy PLRA's requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted before filing suit), overruled on the other grounds, Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 122 S. Ct. 983, 152 L. Ed. 2d 12; Martin, II v. Niagara County Jail, No. 05-CV-868 (JTC), 2012 WL 3230435, at * 6 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 6, 2012) (inmate who fails to exhaust his administrative remedies is barred from commencing a federal lawsuit).
Because failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense, defendants bear the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a plaintiff has failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies.15 See Murray, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32014, 2010 WL 1235591, at *4; Bailey v. Fortier, No. 09-CV-0742 (GLS/DEP), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190646, 2012 WL 6935254, at *6 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2012) (party asserting failure to exhaust bears the burden of proving its elements by a preponderance of the evidence).

B. July 21 and 22, 2011
Plaintiff was transferred to Upstate Correctional Facility ("Upstate") on July 21, 2011, to serve the sixty months SHU time imposed by Gutwein. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 157.) According to Plaintiff, when he arrived, Defendant Chase confronted him with the assault on MacIssac and threatened him with physical harm. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 157.) Chase screamed out to other officers in the area that Plaintiff had assaulted MacIsaac and encouraged them to physically assault Plaintiff and cause him serious injury. Id. After the other inmates were processed, Chase called Plaintiff out into [*37]  the middle of the floor and told ten officers in the area about the assault of MacIsaac and informed them that they had to do something about it. Id. at ¶ 159.
Plaintiff was taken to the facility clinic by Defendants Chase, Monacelli, Laroque, and Riley, where Monacelli directed the camera officer not to record Plaintiff entering the room. Id. at ¶ 163. According to Plaintiff, he was taken into a room by Monacelli and told to remove all of his clothes and was then maliciously beaten by Monacelli, Laroque, and non-defendant officers. Id. at ¶ 163. Plaintiff was punched, elbowed, and kicked all over his body, including his head and face, and his head was shoved into the wall. Id. Monacelli and Laroque punched Plaintiff in the back and ribs, kicked and punched Plaintiff from behind, and kicked Plaintiff in the testicles. Id. Plaintiff called out for help from Riley several times during the beating, but Riley just watched.
Plaintiff claims to have suffered serious bodily injury to his face, shoulder, back, ribs, including a large bump on his forehead, and he was left dizzy and in excruciating pain. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 169.) Plaintiff requested and was denied medical care. Id. According to [*38]  Plaintiff, Laroque and Riley falsified the log book to say that Plaintiff had banged his head against the wall to cover up the beating. Id. at ¶ 169. Plaintiff claims to have been in excruciating pain over night, with his head feeling like it was going to explode, and when he could sleep, he had nightmares. Id. at ¶ 165.
Plaintiff claims that Defendant Lordi came into the clinic the morning of July 22, 2011, and rejected Plaintiff's requests for medical attention. Id. at ¶¶ 166-168. In her declaration in support of her motion for summary judgment, Lordi has stated that she did not work in the Upstate Infirmary where Plaintiff was located on July 22, 2011, and her name did not appear in the Infirmary log.16 (Dkt. No. 157-7 at 2.) Lordi confirmed in her declaration that the infirmary log indicated that Plaintiff was sent to the infirmary because he was banging his head and threatening self harm. Id. at 2, 12-13.
According to Plaintiff, after Lordi had allegedly failed to provide medical care to Plaintiff, a psychiatrist came to see him, and Plaintiff told him about the beating, showed him his injuries, and indicated he was afraid for his life. Id. at ¶ 169. The psychiatrist told Plaintiff [*39]  he would recommend Plaintiff be transferred to Clinton Correctional Facility. Id. Later in the day on July 22, 2011, Defendants Streeter, Bouchey, and King transported Plaintiff to Clinton. Id. at ¶¶ 170-75. While in transport, either Streeter and Bouchey punched Plaintiff's face and the back of his head several times, as if he were trying to decapitate Plaintiff or cause internal bleeding in his brain. Id. at ¶ 171. Streeter or Bouchey continuously struck Plaintiff's head, back, face and all over his body like a machine. (Dkt. N. 111 at ¶ 172.) Plaintiff became dizzy and experienced more pain in his head, back, and face. One of the officers attempted to pop Plaintiff's ear drums. Id. at ¶ 173. Plaintiff claims King was aware of the beating the whole time and did nothing to stop it.17 Id. at ¶ 176.

C. Plaintiff's Attempt to Grieve the Actions of Chase, Riley, Monacelli, Laroque, Lordi, Streeter, Bouchey, and King
Plaintiff claims that on August 8, 2011, while he was in SHU at Clinton, he gave a grievance against the Upstate staff members involved in his assault and refusal of medical care to an officer to forward to the grievance office.18 (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 21; 179-1 at ¶ 21.) At his deposition, [*40]  Plaintiff explained that there are no mail boxes available to inmates in SHU, so the grievance, after being placed in an envelope and addressed to the grievance supervisor, has to be given to an officer to mail. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 105-06.) The fourteen page grievance described in substantial detail the incidents of July 21 and 22, 2011, as described above. (Dkt. No. 26-13 at 2-15.) The last page of the grievance indicated that copies were being sent to Inspector General Richard Roy, Karen Bellamy, the Department of Justice, the Hon. Denise Cote, U.S. District Judge, New York State Police Officer David McNulty, the Dutchess County District Attorney, and the Dutchess County Court. (Dkt. No. 26-13 at 15); see also Dkt. No. 157-2 at 106. In her declaration submitted in support of Defendants' motion, Defendant Clinton IGP Supervisor Tara Brousseau stated she does not recall she or her office receiving or filing the grievance with the IGP, and that a review of her office records did not reflect receipt of the grievance. (Dkt. No. 157-3 at ¶¶ 1, 8-9.)
On August 30, 2011, Plaintiff wrote to Tara Brousseau filing an August 24, 2011, grievance and reminding her that he had written to her about [*41]  the grievance he had filed more than two weeks before against Upstate and had received no response. (Dkt. No. 179-5 at 7.) Plaintiff wrote:
I still waiting for the copy of the grievance and number that my grievance was processed. I would like to know about this grievance if I can get any response from you I will notify everybody and take another steps to the court if necessary. The I.G. also had a copy of the grievance and Captain Lacy, so it is not that my grievance was loss.
Id. Brousseau does not recall receiving the August 30, 2011, letter, and a review of her office's records did not reflect receipt of the letter. (Dkt. No. 157-3 at ¶ 11.)
On August 31, 2011, Plaintiff wrote a letter to Superintendent LaValley which reported that Plaintiff had filed a grievance on August 8, 2011, regarding the assault at the Upstate facility and that he had not yet received a copy of the grievance with the code and title, and had received no acknowledgment of receipt of the grievance by the grievance office. (Dkt. No. 157-3 at 7.) According to Brousseau, Superintendent LaValley referred Plaintiff's August 31, 2011, letter to her for a response on September 6, 2011. (Dkt. No. 157-3 at ¶ 12 and p. [*42]  9.)
After receiving a September 15, 2011, follow-up letter requesting the status of the August 8, 2011, grievance from Plaintiff (Dkt. No. 157-3 at at 11), Brousseau responded to Plaintiff's letter to LaValley on October 20, 2011, a month and a half after LaValley's September 6, 2011, letter directing her to respond. Id. at 13. Brousseau informed Plaintiff that her office had no record of Plaintiff having filed a grievance. Id. at 13. Plaintiff wrote to Brousseau on September 29, 2011, prior to her October 20, 2011, response, informing her that due to a lack of response from the IGRC, he wanted to appeal his August 8, 2011, grievance to the next stage, which Plaintiff believed at that time to be the superintendent. (Dkt. No. 26-13 at 20.) In the letter, Plaintiff reiterated that he had filed his grievance on August 8, 2011, and had not received any response from the IGRC or seen an extension and informed Brousseau that he was "exercising [his] right under Directive 4040 to appeal to the next stage," and "want[ed] his appeal sent to the next stage (superintendent)." Id. According to Brousseau, she does not recall ever having received Plaintiff's September 29, 2010, letter and a review of her office's records [*43]  did not reflect that the letter was received. (Dkt. No. 157-3 at ¶ 11.)
According to Plaintiff, on October 23, 2011, after receiving Brousseau's October 20, 2011, response, Plaintiff attempted to refile the August 8, 2011, grievance by giving a copy to Grievance Sgt. Ludwig, who said he would re-file it because Brousseau refused to file it. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 193; 157-2 at 108-09.) Plaintiff never received notice that the grievance was filed and did not receive a grievance number. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 108.) Brousseau stated in her declaration that she does not recall receiving a complaint from Plaintiff or it being filed as a grievance, and her office's records indicate that no such complaint was received on or about October 23, 2011. (Dkt. No. 157-3 at ¶ 23.) According to Brousseau, if the grievance had been submitted, it would have been rejected as untimely. Id.
Plaintiff never received any confirmation that his August 8, 2011, had been received in the grievance office and did not receive responses to his letters to Brousseau. (Dkt. 157-2 at 108-09.) By letter of October 23, 2011, to Inspector General Roy, Plaintiff requested that an investigation be done regarding his August 8, 2011, [*44]  grievance, and what he believed to be "a clear cover-up." (Dkt. No. 3-17 at 3.) On November 21, 2011, Plaintiff wrote to Karen Bellamy, DOCCS Inmate Grievance Director, requesting that an investigation be conducted regarding his August 8, 2011, grievance which was never filed and he believed had been destroyed. (Dkt. No. 3-17 at 9-10.) Brousseau has stated with certainty in her declaration that she has never failed to process an inmate's grievance sent to the IGP as a grievance and has never destroyed a grievance rather than file it, including those filed by Plaintiff. (Dkt. No. 157-3 at ¶ 17.)

D. DOCCS Grievance Records
Christine Gregory, Inmate Grievance Program Supervisor in the Main Building at Clinton since 2012, is responsible for maintaining grievance records filed by Clinton inmates housed in the Main Building. (Dkt. No. 157-11 at ¶ 5.) According to Gregory, Clinton had a fully functional grievance program available to inmates in 2011. Id. at ¶ 6. Gregory has reviewed her office's record of grievances filed by Plaintiff, which show that Plaintiff filed five grievances in 2011, twenty-three grievances in 2012, and thirty-five grievances in 2013, none of which contain allegations [*45]  that Plaintiff was assaulted by staff at Upstate on July 21 and 22, 2011, or denied medical care on July 22, 2011. Id. at ¶¶ 8-10 and pp. 5-8.
Jeffrey Hale, Assistant Director of the DOCCS IGP is the custodian of records maintained by CORC. (Dkt. No. 157-10 at ¶¶ 1 and 2.) CORC maintains records on grievance appeals for the current year and the previous four calendar years in accordance with DOCCS policy. Id. at ¶ 7. The CORC computer database contains records of all appeals of grievances heard and decided by CORC dating back to 1990. Id. Hale has conducted a diligent search for appeals by Plaintiff based on grievances denied at the facilities level and found that Plaintiff appealed to CORC four grievances originally filed at Clinton in 2011, twenty-one grievances filed at Clinton in 2012, and thirty grievances filed at Clinton in 2013. Id. at ¶ 11. None of the grievances appealed to CORC by Plaintiff pertain to allegations that Plaintiff was assaulted by Upstate staff on July 21 and 22, 2011, or denied medical care on July 22, 2011. Id. at ¶¶ 13 and 14.

E. Analysis of Defendants' Exhaustion Defense
Plaintiff does not dispute that his August 8, 2011, grievance (Dkt. No. 26-13 at 2-15), [*46]  which was never filed in the Clinton grievance office, was not appealed to CORC. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the DOCCS IGP. See Woodford, 548 U.S. at 93 (prisoner who has failed to properly follow each of the applicable steps, including receipt of a decision from CORC, prior to commencing litigation, has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and is barred from commencing a federal lawsuit).
However, as recognized by the Supreme Court in Ross, a finding of failure to exhaust does not end a court's exhaustion review because "the PLRA contains its own, textual exception to mandatory exhaustion." Ross, 136 S.Ct. at 1858. Under the PLRA, "the exhaustion requirement hinges on the 'availab[ility]' of administrative remedies: An inmate, that is, must exhaust available remedies, but need not exhaust unavailable ones." Id. Thus, courts are tasked with determining whether or not a prisoner's administrative remedies are, in fact, "available."
The Supreme Court found the ordinary meaning of the word "available" to be "'capable of use for the accomplishment of a purpose,' and that which 'is accessible or may be obtained.'" Id. (quoting Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 737-38, 121 S. Ct. 1819, 149 L. Ed. 2d 958 (2001)). "Accordingly, an inmate is required to exhaust [*47]  those, but only those, grievance procedures that are 'capable of use' to obtain 'some relief for the action complained of.'" Id. at 1859 (citation omitted).
To guide courts in the "availability" analysis, the Supreme Court in Ross identified "three kinds of circumstances" in which an administrative remedy, "although officially on the books," is not "available."19 Id. at 1853. First, "an administrative procedure is unavailable when (despite what regulations or guidance materials may promise) it operates as a simple dead end with officers unable or consistently unwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmates." Id. "Next, an administrative scheme might be so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use." Id. at 1853-54. Finally, an administrative remedy is not "available" when "prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation." Id. at 1854. When one of the three circumstances is found, "an inmate's duty to exhaust 'available' remedies does not come into play. Id. at 1859.
There is conflicting evidence in the record concerning whether Plaintiff filed a grievance regarding the alleged July 21 and 22, 2011, assaults by Upstate [*48]  staff, and the July 22, 2011, medical indifference. The summary judgment record includes the August 8, 2011, grievance Plaintiff claims to have given to an officer to mail to the grievance office while he was in SHU at Clinton. (Dkt. No. 26-13 at 2-15.) The record also contains a series of follow-up letters from Plaintiff to Brousseau regarding the status of the grievance, including a letter of intent to appeal to the next step, and a number of letters to DOCCS personnel, including Superintendent LaValley, Bellamy, and former Commissioner Fischer referencing the grievance, seeking assistance in finding out the status of the grievance, and complaining that Brousseau had violated Directive 4040 and had destroyed his grievances and refused to file an appeal with CORC for the sole purpose of covering up official misconduct. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶¶ 194-201.)
Brousseau has stated in her declaration that she has no recollection of Plaintiff filing the August 8, 2011, grievance regarding the assault by Upstate personnel or, with the exception of Plaintiff's September 15, 2011, letter, receiving any of his follow up correspondence. (Dkt. No. 157-3 at ¶ 23.) Brousseau has also stated that searches [*49]  have revealed no records in the grievance office regarding the August 8, 2011, grievance. Id. Gregory and Hale, in their declarations, have stated that there is no record of Plaintiff having filed a grievance regarding the July 21 and 22, 2011, assaults and July 22, 2011, medical indifference, or of an appeal to CORC. (Dkt Nos. 157-10 at ¶¶ 13-14; 157-11 at ¶¶ 8-10.)
When questions of fact and issues of credibility exist regarding the failure to exhaust remedies under the DOCCS IGP, a court should neither engage is fact finding nor make determinations as to credibility in addressing a defendants' motion for summary for failure to exhaust. See, e.g., White v. Clark, No. 9:12-CV-986 (NAM/DJS), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17689, at * 16-18 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 11, 2016)20 (finding that assessments of credibility are not proper on summary judgment and disputed issues of material fact had to await an exhaustion hearing); Nelson v. Plumley, No. 9:12-CV-422 (TJM/DEP), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129973, 2014 WL 4659327, at * 13 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2014) (denial of summary judgment and referral for an exhaustion hearing where issues of fact were found in the question of exhaustion); Bailey, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190646, 2010 WL 4005258, at *7 and n.7 (summary judgment not appropriate where genuine issues of fact exist as to whether plaintiff was precluded from exhausting administrative remedies by the actions of prison officials); [*50]  Collins v. Goord, 438 F. Supp. 2d 399, 414 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (summary judgment denied where plaintiff's submissions found sufficient to raise an issue of fact on whether the IGP process was, in fact, "available" to him). The Court finds that the squarely conflicting accounts of the parties regarding the exhaustion issue give rise to a material dispute of fact regarding whether Plaintiff was thwarted from taking advantage of the grievance process through "machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation," thereby precluding summary judgment. Ross, 136 S.Ct. at 1853-55.
In addition, Plaintiff, who sent a letter attempting to appeal his August 8, 2011, grievance to the next level after he had heard nothing, argues in his declaration in response to Defendants' motion that the DOCCS appeals process, particularly when an inmate has no knowledge whether his grievance "was filed, destroyed, or assigned a different code or title," is "so opaque and so confusing that no reasonable person can use it." (Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 27.) In Williams, 829 F.3d at 126, the Second Circuit concluded that exhaustion is unavailable where "the regulations plainly do not describe a mechanism for appealing a grievance that was never filed," and the "process to appeal an unfiled and unanswered grievance is prohibitively opaque, [*51]  such that no inmate could actually make use of it."
Based upon the foregoing, the Court recommends that Defendants' motion for summary judgment, insofar as it raises the affirmative defense of failure to exhaust with respect to the Eighth Amendment claims against Chase, Riley, Monacelli, Laroque, Lordi, Streeter, Bouchey, and King, be denied.

VI. FIRST AMENDMENT RETALIATION CLAIMS
Defendants seek summary judgment on Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claims against Brousseau, Brown, Cross, Lee, and Beaudette. (Dkt. No. 157-14 at 11-21.) To prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, an inmate must establish "(1) that the speech or conduct at issue was protected, (2) that the defendant took adverse action against the plaintiff, and (3) that there was a causal connection between the protected [conduct] and the adverse action." Holland v. Goord, 758 F.3d 215, 225 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Espinal v. Goord, 558 F.3d 119, 128 (2d Cir. 2009); see also Gill v. Pidlypchak, 389 F.3d 379, 380 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Dawes v. Walker, 239 F.3d 489, 492 (2d Cir. 2001), overruled on other grounds, Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, 534 U.S. 506, 508, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002)). "Adverse action" for purposes of a retaliation claim has been defined objectively as "retaliatory conduct that would deter a similarly situated individual of ordinary firmness from exercising . . . constitutional rights." Pidlypchak, 389 F.3d at 381. Otherwise, the retaliatory act is simply de minimis and outside the scope of constitutional protection. See Roseboro v. Gillespie, 791 F. Supp. 2d 353, 366 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (citing Dawes, 239 F.3d at 492-93).
An inmate bears [*52]  the burden of showing that "the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor" in the defendants' decision to take action against the plaintiff. Graham v. Henderson, 89 F.3d 75, 79 (2d Cir. 1996). In evaluating whether a causal connection exists between the plaintiff's protected activity and a prison official's actions, "a number of factors may be considered, including: (I) the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the alleged retaliatory act; (ii) the inmate's prior good disciplinary record; (iii) vindication at a hearing on the matter; and (iv) statements by the defendant concerning his motivation. Baskerville v. Blot, 224 F. Supp. 2d 723, 732 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (citing Colon, 58 F.3d at 873). "The causal connection must be sufficient to support an inference that the protected conduct played a substantial part in the adverse action." Id. A showing of temporal proximity, without more, has generally been found insufficient to survive summary judgment. See Roseboro,791 F. Supp. 2d at 370 (citations omitted). There are, however, decisions by the Second Circuit in which courts have concluded that temporal proximity between protected activity and allegedly false disciplinary charges may be enough to withstand summary judgment where combined with evidence that the author of the charges knew of the protected conduct, as well [*53]  as evidence of a prior record of good behavior, or that the charges were dismissed or successfully appealed. See Washington v. Donahue, 146 F. Supp. 3d 503, 506-07 (W.D.N.Y. 2015) (collecting Second Circuit cases).
Because of the relative ease with which claims of retaliation can be incanted, courts have scrutinized retaliation claims with particular care. See Flaherty v. Coughlin, 713 F.2d 10, 13 (2d Cir. 1983), overruled on other grounds, Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 506. As the Second Circuit has noted,
[t]his is true for several reasons. First, claims of retaliation are difficult to dispose of on the pleadings because they involve questions of intent and are therefore easily fabricated. Second, prisoners' claims of retaliation pose a substantial risk of unwarranted judicial intrusion into matters of general prison administration. This is so because virtually any adverse action taken against a prisoner by a prison official--even those otherwise not rising to the level of a constitutional violation--can be characterized as a constitutionally proscribed retaliatory act.
Dawes, 239 F.3d at 491. Accordingly, claims of retaliation must be supported by specific facts; conclusory statements are not sufficient. Flaherty, 713 F.2d at 13; see also Houston v. Goord, No. 9:03-CV-1412 (GTS/DEP), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27481, 2009 WL 890658, at * 11 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2009) ("Analysis of retaliation claims . . . requires thoughtful consideration of the evidence presented concerning the protected [*54]  activity in which the inmate Plaintiff has engaged and the adverse action taken against him or her, as well as the evidence tending to link the two. When such claims, which ordinarily are exceedingly case specific, are alleged in only conclusory fashion, and are not supported by evidence establishing the requisite nexus between any protected activity and the adverse action complained of, the entry of summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's retaliation claims is warranted.").
Even if a plaintiff makes the appropriate showing of retaliation, a defendant may avoid liability if he demonstrates that he would have taken the adverse action even in the absence of the protected conduct. See Scott v. Coughlin, 344 F.3d 282, 287-88 (2d Cir. 2003) ("Regardless of the presence of retaliatory motive, . . . a defendant may be entitled to summary judgment if he can show . . . that even without the improper motivation the alleged retaliatory action would have occurred.") (citation omitted); Roseboro, 791 F. Supp. 2d at 371.

A. Brousseau
1. Retaliation Claim
Plaintiff claims that Brousseau retaliated against him by failing to file or by destroying grievances he submitted to the grievance office. The first grievance Plaintiff claims Brousseau refused to file was the August 8, 2011, assault [*55]  grievance against the Upstate staff members. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 121.)
In his second amended complaint, Plaintiff has alleged that on November 21, 2011, he complained to Bellamy that Brousseau had "violat[ed] Directive 4040 and destroy[ed] the Plaintiff's Grievances and refus[ed] to file an appeal with CORC for the sole purpose of covering up Official's misconduct." (Dkt. Nos. 3-17 at 9-10; 111 at ¶ 201.) In his declaration in response to Defendants' motion, Plaintiff has repeated that he had sent the November 21, 2011, complaint to Bellamy regarding the destruction of his grievances, including the August 8, 2011, assault grievance against the Upstate staff "for the sole purpose of covering up official misconduct." (Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 29.) Plaintiff also stated in the declaration that on December 22, 2011, he filed a complaint against Brousseau with the Superintendent "for the ongoing and repeatedly refusing to file his grievances, harassment, and retaliation while acting in concert with others to cover up misconduct by destroying Plaintiff's grievances." Id. at ¶ 31.
Plaintiff testified at his deposition that Brousseau had retaliated against him by failing to file his grievances because Plaintiff had filed complaints [*56]  against Brousseau with DOCCS administrators. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 118, 120-22.) Plaintiff's retaliation claim against Brousseau appears to be based in significant part on an incident he contends occurred outside of his SHU cell in January of 2012. According to Plaintiff, a male whom Plaintiff believed at the time to be grievance supervisor Tara Brousseau (who is a female), stopped outside his cell and told Plaintiff he wanted to speak with him about all of the letters and complaints he had sent to the Superintendent and Albany about his job as grievance supervisor.21 (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 212.) When Plaintiff explained he only wanted to know what had happened to the grievances he had filed, the man Plaintiff believed to be Brousseau screamed at Plaintiff that he had filed every grievance received by his office. Id. at ¶ 213. According to Plaintiff, the man then screamed:
Mr. Quezada, I don't fucking care what happened to you at Upstate Correctional Facility. You're in SHU for assaulting an officer at Green Haven C.F. and on top of that, you cut the officer with a razor blade. So Mr. Quezada, "what's go around come around." You don't told me how to do my job, you're an inmate in SHU, I answer [*57]  the grievances when I wanted, so if you don't like it, stopped filing grievances and the complaint to the Superintendent about my job because you just made everything worse for you and I don't like heard from Superintendent about you every day.
Id. at ¶ 214. Plaintiff described the encounter again at his deposition and claimed that Brousseau had retaliated against him by telling him to stop filing grievances. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 119.) Plaintiff also testified that he believed Brousseau had sent an officer to search his cell and destroy another copy of the grievance. Id. at 120-21.
Defendant Brousseau denies ever having approached Plaintiff at his cell and verbally harassing him or having failed to process or having destroyed Plaintiff's grievances "neither in order to retaliate against plaintiff for filing letters of complaint about me with DOCCS administrators or otherwise." (Dkt. No. 157-3 at ¶ 21.) Brousseau further denies ever having sent a corrections officer to Plaintiff's cell to destroy his grievance or property and denies having the authority to have done so. Id. at ¶ 22. According to Brousseau, she has "never taken any action of any kind against plaintiff in order to retaliate against him [*58]  because he filed grievances or sent letters of complaint to DOCCS administrators alleging misconduct on [her] part." Id. at ¶ 24.
2. Analysis
As noted above, Plaintiff has, on occasion, attributed Brousseau's alleged failure to file, or her destruction of, his August 8, 2011, grievance as an act of retaliation against him for filing grievances and complaints. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 118, 120-22). The filing of prisoner grievances and complaints has been found to constitute protected conduct under the First Amendment for purposes of a retaliation claim. See Davis v. Goord, 320 F.3d 346, 352 (2d Cir. 2003) (prisoner grievances); Moore v. Philips, No. 04 Civ. 8908 (DLC), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20769, 2006 WL 1006538, at * 3 (S.D.N.Y. April 18, 2006) (complaint letters to DOCCS officials). However, even assuming for purposes of this motion that the refusal to file and/or the destruction of two of Plaintiff's grievances is sufficient to constitute adverse action, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to raise an issue of fact precluding summary judgment on the issue of causation whether the causal connection between Plaintiff's complaints against Brousseau and her alleged refusal to file, or her destruction of, Plaintiff's grievances is sufficient to support an inference that the protected conduct played a substantial part in the adverse action. See Baskerville, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 732.
Plaintiff's alleges [*59]  in his second amended complaint and states in his declaration in response to Defendant's motion that Brousseau's "sole purpose" in refusing to file his grievances regarding the assault by Upstate officers was to cover up "official misconduct," not to retaliate against Plaintiff. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 201; 179-1 at ¶ 29.) While at his deposition, Plaintiff testified that Brousseau retaliated against him because he had filed a grievance against staff (presumably the Upstate staff), as a general matter, it is difficult to establish that a defendant had cause to retaliate against a plaintiff for filing a grievance against another party. See Wright v. Goord, 554 F.3d 255, 274 (2d Cir. 2009) (dismissing retaliation claim against a corrections officer when the only alleged basis for retaliation was a complaint about an incident involving another corrections officer); Guillory v. Ellis, No. 9:11-CV-600 (MAD/ATB), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120709, 2014 WL 4365274, at 18 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 18, 2014) ("it is difficult to establish one defendant's retaliation for complaints against another defendant"); Roseboro, 791 F. Supp. 2d at 369 (failure by plaintiff to provide any basis to believe corrections counselor would retaliate for a grievance in which she was not personally named); Ciaprazi v. Goord, No. 9:02-CV-915 (GLS/DEP), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38238, 2005 WL 3531464, at * 8-9 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2005) (granting summary judgment and dismissing retaliation [*60]  claim based only on plaintiff's conclusory allegations that the manifest falsity of the misbehavior report and testimony during the disciplinary hearing indicate the disciplinary matters were motivated by retaliatory animus due to grievances plaintiff filed against individuals other than the defendants involved in the disciplinary hearing). Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff may intend to claim that Brousseau retaliated against him for filing a grievance against Upstate staff members, the claim is wholly conclusory and thus inadequate to raise an issue as to causation. See Dorsey v. Fisher, 468 F. App'x 25, 27 (2d Cir. 2012) ("[W]here . . . the plaintiff alleges the ultimate fact of retaliation in a conclusory and speculative manner, he fails to state a claim for retaliation.") (citing Flaherty v. Coughlin, 713 F.2d 10, 13 (2d Cir. 1983)).
As to Plaintiff's claim that Brousseau refused to file or destroyed the August 8, 2011, grievance in retaliation for Plaintiff's complaints about her to DOCCS administrators, the Court notes that Plaintiff's complaints were not made until after Plaintiff had been unsuccessful in getting his grievance filed. See Seale v. Madison, No. 5:11-CV-0278 (GTS/ATB), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24519, 2015 WL 667531, at * 22 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 2015) ("[I]t is obvious that protected activity must precede any purported retaliation to [establish] a First Amendment retaliation claim.") [*61]  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff also claims that Brousseau failed to file or destroyed his October 23, 2011, resubmission of his August 8, 2011, grievance in retaliation for his having filed complaints against her with DOCCS administrators. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 118, 120-22.) However, in both his second amended complaint and declaration, Plaintiff has claimed that when he attempted to re-file the grievance, he placed Brousseau on notice that if the IGP did not file the grievance, she would be added to Plaintiff's lawsuit for "denying Plaintiff his right to complain to the Government and denying access to the Court, with the only sole purpose of covering up official's misconduct." (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 193; see also 179-1 at ¶ 28.)
Brousseau has denied failing to file or destroying any of Plaintiff's grievances and has stated that if Plaintiff had submitted the October 23, 2011, grievance for filing it would have been rejected as untimely under the DOCCS IGP in any event. Id. at § 701.5(a). (Dkt. No. 157-3 at ¶ 21, 23.) Plaintiff has submitted no non-conclusory evidence to the contrary. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 193.) Furthermore, Plaintiff's complaints to DOCCS administrators against [*62]  Brousseau generally post-dated the re-filing of his August 8, 2011, grievance on October 23, 2011. (See Dkt. No. 111 at ¶¶ 192, 196, 199-201.) Even if that were not the case, a showing of temporal proximity, which is all Plaintiff has shown in support of his retaliation claim, has generally been found insufficient to survive summary judgment. See Roseboro,791 F. Supp. 2d at 370 (citations omitted).
The only other grievance Plaintiff has identified as having not been filed or having been destroyed by Brousseau is a grievance allegedly written on November 26, 2011, and re-filed on December 12, 2011, requesting transfer to a federal prison. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 203, 206; 157-14 at 15.) In her declaration, Brousseau denies having refused the grievance and states that her records indicate that the IGRC filed a grievance by Plaintiff on February 7, 2012, pertaining to the request for a transfer to federal prison. (Dkt. No. 157-3 at ¶ 19. The grievance was denied by the IGRC and on appeals to both the Superintendent and CORC. Id. at ¶ 19 and pp. 16, 18-35. The Court finds no evidence in the record to the contrary.
Brousseau has also denied ever approaching Plaintiff's cell, and in response to Plaintiff's "belief" that she [*63]  sent officers to search his cell to destroy his grievances and property (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 120-21), has denied doing so. Id. at ¶ 22. Plaintiff has submitted no evidence other than his "belief" to the contrary, and the person Plaintiff identified as Brousseau, who allegedly came to Plaintiff's cell, was described by Plaintiff as a man in his second amended complaint and deposition testimony. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 212; 157-2 at 119.) It was only after Plaintiff learned at his deposition that Defendant Brousseau is a woman that he identified her as a woman in his description of the incident in his declaration. (Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 32.) In short, there is no evidentiary support for a retaliation claim against Brousseau by Plaintiff based on the claim that she visited his cell or that she directed officers to search his cell and destroy grievances and property.
Based upon the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to submit evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that there was a causal connection between his filing of grievances or his complaints to DOCCS administrators regarding Brousseau and the non-filing or destruction of his grievances. That is especially so given [*64]  Plaintiff's oft repeated conflicting claim that Brousseau's motivation in refusing to file or destroying his grievances was to cover up the misconduct of the Upstate staff members. See Jeffreys, 426 F.3d at 554 (finding it is only "in the rare circumstances where the plaintiff relies almost exclusively on his own testimony, much of which is contradictory and incomplete," that the district court may conclude that no reasonable jury would credit the plaintiff's testimony.) The Court therefore recommends that Brousseau be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

B. Brown
1. Retaliation Claim
Plaintiff claims that Defendant Brown, Deputy Superintendent of Security at Clinton, retaliated against him for filing grievances against a Clinton corrections officer. According to Plaintiff, on January 17 and 20, 2012, he filed grievances against Clinton Sgt. Delutis for refusing to provide him with reasonable accommodations by moving him to 4 Company, a special unit that could accommodate his physical disabilities. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶¶ 221-22.) Plaintiff has alleged that Delutis had ignored his requests and "retaliated because they wanted to read Plaintiff's legal documents and refused to let him seal his [*65]  legal mail in a box" for two months. Id. at ¶ 222. Plaintiff notified his attorney who in turn called Brown, which according to Plaintiff, resulted in his being allowed to send his legal mail out in the manner allowed by law. Id. Plaintiff may also be claiming that Brown was upset because Plaintiff had complained about Brown attempting to cover up problems at Clinton to an investigator from the Inspector General's Office who had come to interview Plaintiff about the July 21, 2011, assault at Upstate, and the investigator told Plaintiff he would discuss it with Brown. Id. at ¶ 225.
Plaintiff contends that on January 20, 2012, Brown came to his cell and began screaming at him about the grievance he had filed against Delutis and the phone call he had received from Plaintiff's attorney. Id. at ¶ 223. According to Plaintiff, Brown told him that because Plaintiff had filed a grievance against Delutis after Brown had taken care of the problem with Plaintiff's lawyer, Plaintiff was going to have to stay where he was for six months, and if he did not cause any more problems during that time he might be moved to 4 Company, the unit he had requested to accommodate his physical disabilities. Id. [*66]  Plaintiff claims that Brown told him to stop writing grievances for "petty shit" or he would never go to the special unit. Id. Plaintiff contends he became fearful and did not write other grievances because he was afraid it would impact upon his request to move.22 Id. at ¶ 224.
However, on January 24, 2012, Plaintiff did write a grievance against Brown claiming that Brown had retaliated against him for filing grievances against Sgt. Delutis by denying him a transfer to 4 Company.23 (Dkt. No. 157-4 at 11-15.) Plaintiff requested transfer to a federal prison or transfer to 4 Company at Clinton to accommodate his disabilities. (Dkt. No. 157-4 at 15.) The grievance was treated as a Code 49 and passed through to the Superintendent. Id. at 10.
In a February 3, 2012, memorandum in response to Plaintiff's grievance, Brown stated that while he was making rounds in SHU on January 20, 2012, Plaintiff asked him about a move, and Brown told him that his present placement was appropriate and he would not be moved.24 Id. at 22. Plaintiff stated that denying him the move was retaliatory for a grievance he had filed, and he was going to contact his lawyer. Id. Brown then questioned Plaintiff as to why he felt the need to grieve [*67]  things, i.e., his legal mail complaint, that had already been taken care of, and Plaintiff explained that he filed the grievance before his legal mail was sent. Id. According to Brown, Plaintiff was "told in no uncertain terms that whether a grievance was filed or he notified his lawyer, if he was due something he would receive it . . . and he should talk to staff or himself and the end results will be the same." Id. Brown also noted that Plaintiff had made it known he would do anything he could to be transferred to a federal prison, and he would try any means possible, including making medical claims, to move to 4 Company. Id.
The Superintendent, who denied the grievance, found that "[a]n investigation was conducted and it was determined that the grievant was given sound advice regarding facility procedures by the DDS. It is noted the grievant did not accept the constructive criticism well and subsequently filed the grievance against Brown." (Dkt. No. 157-4 at 16.) Plaintiff appealed to CORC, and CORC, concluding it had not been provided with sufficient evidence to substantiate retaliation by Brown, upheld the Superintendent's determination. Id. at 7. According to CORC, Plaintiff was "not entitled [*68]  to be housed on the company of his choice, and that he is appropriately housed in SHU due to his own misbehavior." Id.
The record reveals that Plaintiff requested reasonable accommodations to move to 4 Company on February 1, 2012. (Dkt. No. 157-6 at 16.) His request was granted by the doctor and Deputy of Programs on February 22, 2012, a month after his discussion with Brown, and he was moved to 4 Company. Id.; see also Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 236; 179-1 at ¶ 49. However,
Plaintiff's stay in 4 Company was short lived as he was moved back to 3 Company on June 27, 2012. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 244; 157-6 at 16.) According to Defendant Lee, Plaintiff's move back to 3 Company was made for security reasons. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at ¶ 18.) Plaintiff thereafter, on or about July 9, 2012, filed a grievance against Defendant Cross for denying reasonable accommodations for his physical disabilities by moving him back to 3 Company. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 14-20.) The grievance was denied by CORC which found that the reasonable accommodations deemed medically necessary for Plaintiff were being provided where he was being housed. Id. at 9.
2. Analysis
As noted above, the filing of prisoner grievances is protected conduct for purposes [*69]  of a retaliation claim. See Davis, 320 F.3d at 352. Therefore, Plaintiff has shown that he engaged in protected conduct in filing the grievances against Delutis and possibly in complaining to his attorney about Brown.
In addition, the Court cannot rule out Brown's alleged threat regarding a move to 4 Company could be found to constitute adverse action, especially since shortly thereafter Plaintiff's physical limitations were found to be serious enough to warrant the move. See Pidlypchak, 389 F.3d at 381 (adverse action defined as conduct that would deter a similarly situated individual of ordinary firmness from exercising constitutional rights). Plaintiff claims Brown's actions made him so fearful that he did not write other grievances because he was afraid it would negatively impact his chances to move. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 224.)
Until Ford v. Palmer, 539 F. App'x 5, 5 (2d Cir. 2013), verbal threats alone were generally not considered as adverse action for purposes of a First Amendment retaliation claim unless they were sufficiently direct and specific. See Mateo v. Fischer, 682 F.Supp. 2d 423, 434 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (collecting cases). In Ford, the Second Circuit indicated that certain less direct and specific verbal threats could also constitute adverse action for purposes of retaliation. Ford, 539 F. App'x at 7. In Ford, a correctional officer had threatened to poison plaintiff [*70]  by putting "some kind of substance in [his] hot water" in retaliation for filing a grievance against him. The Second Circuit concluded the district court had "erred in reasoning, as a matter of law, that verbal threats must be more definite and specific than the [defendant's] alleged threat in order to constitute 'adverse action.'" Id. The Court noted the vague nature of the threat not telling plaintiff how or when he planned to poison him "could have enhanced the effectiveness as a threat and increased the likelihood that a person of ordinary firmness would be deterred from filing additional grievances." Id.
In this case, Brown's alleged threat was specific in the sense that Plaintiff was threatened with being unable to move to 4 Company unless his conduct met certain standards for six months. However, it was vague in the sense that Plaintiff was allegedly told generally that he would be required not to cause any more problems or file grievances for "petty shit" for six months, without being given any specific guidance as to what would be considered a problem or a grievance for "petty shit." (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 224.) The Court finds the uncertainty created by the absence of any such [*71]  guidelines might reasonably be found to deter a "similarly situated individual of ordinary firmness from exercising . . . constitutional rights." Pidlypchak, 389 F.3d at 381.
Whether Plaintiff was actually deterred from filing grievances as a result of Brown's threat, as he claims, is called into serious doubt by his January 24, 2012, grievance against Brown for his allegedly retaliatory actions in refusing to allow Plaintiff to move because of grievances he had filed. (Dkt. No. 157-4 at 11-15.) However, the test for adverse action is an objective one, and the fact that Plaintiff may have responded with greater than ordinary firmness in filing the January 24, 2012, grievance against Brown does not deprive him of his claim. See Ford, 539 F. App'x at 6 ("As we have stated, the 'objective test' [for First Amendment retaliation] applies even where a particular plaintiff was not himself subjectively deterred; that is, where he continued to file grievances and lawsuits.") (quoting Pidlypchak, 389 F.3d at 381)).
The Court also concludes that there are issues of material fact with regard to causation that preclude summary judgment in Brown's favor. Although it is difficult to establish retaliation for complaints against a third party, Wright, 554 F.3d at 274, in this action Brown, by speaking with Plaintiff's [*72]  attorney, became personally involved in the subject matter of the grievances and was angry at Plaintiff for filing a grievance after Brown had fixed the problem. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 222.) Brown has conceded that during the encounter he asked Plaintiff why he had filed a grievance regarding something that had already been resolved. (Dkt. No. 157-4 at 22.) However, Brown has denied that telling Plaintiff he would not be moved was retaliatory, claiming that he told Plaintiff it was because his present placement was appropriate. (Dkt. No. 157-4 at 22.)
Brown has argued that he is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's retaliation claim because Plaintiff would not have been transferred to 4 Company even absent a retaliatory motive. (Dkt. No. 154-14 at 18-19.) See Scott, 344 F.3d at 287-88. The Court finds that Brown's reliance on Plaintiff having been moved from a cell with an adjacent shower some months later on December 24, 2012, due to misbehavior fails to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Plaintiff would not have been transferred to 4 Company in January 2012 absent a retaliatory motive by Brown. See Graham v. Henderson, 89 F.3d 75, 79 (2d Cir. 1996). In fact, as noted above, Plaintiff was moved to 4 Company to accommodate his physical impairments [*73]  a month after his encounter with Brown in July 2012. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 236; 157-6 at 16; 179-1 at ¶ 49.)
The Court finds that there are credibility issues with regard to Plaintiff's and Brown's differing descriptions of the July 2012 encounter out of which the retaliation claim arises. These issues, which are material to the determination of Plaintiff's claim, are for determination by the factfinder, not the Court. See Rule, 85 F.3d at 1011. Accordingly, the Court recommends that Brown's motion for summary judgment be denied.

C. Cross
1. Retaliation Claim
As aptly described by Defendants, Plaintiff "[i]n entirely conclusory and formulaic fashion . . . merely labels certain events in the complaint as 'retaliation' by defendant Cross." (Dkt. No. 157-14 at 19.) Plaintiff claims that Cross retaliated against him for filing unidentified grievances by denying him headphones, moving him out of 4 Company into an unsanitary unit for disruptive inmates, denying him a shower chair, and forcing him to sit on the floor instead of sitting on his bed to put on his knee brace, thereby depriving Plaintiff of the opportunity to move around during his recreation time. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 267-69, 272, 277-81, 293-94, 304-05; 179 [*74]  at 27-28; 179-1 at ¶¶ 55-56.)
2. Analysis
Filing grievances is protected conduct for purposes of a retaliation claim. See Davis, 320 F.3d at 352. However, Plaintiff has not identified any particular grievances that preceded the alleged retaliation or alleged any facts that support the requisite causal connection. He has merely claimed retaliation in conclusory fashion.
Plaintiff has alleged he filed grievances against Cross. However, with the exception of a grievance filed seeking reasonable accommodations under the ADA and RA in the form of a move to 4 Company (Dkt. No. 157-6 at 14), the grievances identified in the record as having been filed by Plaintiff complaining of retaliation by Cross appear to have been filed after, not before, the alleged retaliatory acts. For example, in his December 26, 2012, grievance against Cross, Plaintiff complained, inter alia, that Cross had retaliated against him for filing too many grievances and asking for too many videos of incidents by moving him back to 2 Company, requiring him to use an unsanitary shower, and forcing him to bend his back to remove his knee brace. The allegedly retaliatory acts took place before the filing of the grievance, and Plaintiff did not specifically [*75]  identify grievances filed before as the protected conduct necessary for a First Amendment retaliation claim. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 266, 269; 157-6 at 46.)
On February 16, 2013, Plaintiff submitted a grievance against Cross for retaliating against him by not allowing him to sit on the bed to put on his knee brace. (Dkt. Nos. 157-6 at 74.) Plaintiff did not identify the protected grievance or grievances that had led to the retaliation. Id. On April 29, 2013, Plaintiff submitted a grievance against Cross for retaliation arising out of his March 2013 memorandum to staff prohibiting Plaintiff from using his knee brace in his cell or sitting on his bed to put on the knee brace for security reasons, again without identifying a specific grievance as protected conduct. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 282; Dkt. No. 157-6 at 111.)
Claims of retaliation must be supported by specific evidence. Flaherty, 713 F.2d at 13. Conclusory assertions of retaliation are not sufficient. Id. Furthermore, protected activity, such as the filing of grievances, must precede any purported retaliation, and Plaintiff has failed to show that to be the case. See Seale, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24519, 2015 WL 667531, at * 22. Therefore, Plaintiff's grievances that grieve the retaliatory conduct of which he now complains cannot satisfy [*76]  the causation element of a grievance claim, and the Court recommends that Cross be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim.

D. Lee
1. Retaliation Claim
C.O. Lee was assigned to the SHU (or "Unit 14") at Clinton and was the 3 Company officer on Unit 14 on June 26, 2012, when following an order from Captain Lucia, he unsealed Plaintiff's draft bags to allow him to retrieve legal material he needed for a September 19, 2012, court deadline. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 242, 179-1 at ¶ 28, 157-8 at ¶ 8.) Lee has stated in his declaration that he allowed Plaintiff to retrieve materials that looked like they might have been related to his legal papers and denied those that did not. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at ¶ 11.)
According to Plaintiff, Lee placed documents he needed for the court deadline back in the draft bag, and when Plaintiff complained Lee told him to file a grievance. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 242; 179-1 at ¶ 28.) When Plaintiff was returned to his cell, he asked Lee to correct paperwork to indicate there were three, not two, draft bags. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 244.) Plaintiff claims that Lee became upset and told Plaintiff he could start packing his things because he was going to be moved from [*77]  4 Company and would not be coming back. (Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 28.) Plaintiff contends that Lee was upset about the grievances Plaintiff had filed against Delutis and other officers and because Captain Lucia had ordered him to retrieve Plaintiff's documents. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 244, 246; 179-1 at ¶ 28.)
Plaintiff was moved to 3 Company June 27, 2012. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at ¶ 18.) Plaintiff claims that Lee moved him without regard to his medical disabilities and his reasonable accommodation approval from medical and administration, in retaliation for grievances Plaintiff had filed against Delutis and Brown and for asking for permission to retrieve his legal papers. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 244, 246; 179-1 at ¶ 39.) According to Lee, as a corrections officer, he had no authority to move Plaintiff's cell location and had no involvement in Plaintiff's June 27, 2012, cell move. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at ¶¶ 17-18.)
The day he was moved to his new cell, Plaintiff found a weapon he believed to have been planted by Lee so that he could falsely accuse Plaintiff. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 247.) When Captain Lucia stopped at Plaintiff's cell, Plaintiff told him that he had discovered the weapon, and that Lee had planted [*78]  it in retaliation for being asked to provide Plaintiff with his legal documents and the filing of grievances by Plaintiff. Id. at ¶ 248. Lee has denied planting a weapon in Plaintiff's cell and retaliating against Plaintiff because he reported finding a weapon in his cell. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at ¶¶ 17-18.)
According to Plaintiff, when Lee learned that he had told Lucia about the planted weapon, Lee put a second plan in effect and denied Plaintiff legal supplies he needed for his legal work. (Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 39.) Lee denies that he denied Plaintiff legal supplies, stating in his declaration that he always provided Plaintiff with any and all legal supplies Plaintiff needed. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at ¶¶ 14-15.)
Lee allegedly fabricated an IMR against Plaintiff on June 27, 2012 charging him with threats 102.10 and harassment 107.11 in retaliation for Plaintiff returning the planted weapon to Lucia. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 249.) Lee contends that he issued the IMR because as he was handing out legal supplies on June 27, 2012, Plaintiff threatened him stating "You gonna get hurt by me soon Lee." (Dkt. No. 157-8 at ¶ 24.) According to Lee, he took the threat seriously in light of Plaintiff's violent disciplinary [*79]  history, and because threats to correctional staff are a violation of disciplinary rules, he felt that the threatening comment warranted an IMR. Id.
Plaintiff was found guilty and commenced an Article 78 proceeding which was dismissed after the state court was advised that the guilty finding had been reversed. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 250.) Plaintiff filed a grievance against Lee on July 11, 2012, claiming that Lee had verbally threatened and harassed him and issued a false IMR in retaliation for Plaintiff filing the June 27, 2012, grievance. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at 14-21, 48-51.) The grievance was denied through CORC. Id. at 56.
2. Analysis
Plaintiff claims that Lee retaliated against him by moving him from 4 Company, planting a weapon in his cell, and denying him legal supplies, all because Plaintiff asked for permission to retrieve legal documents and filed grievances against Delutis and Brown. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 244, 246-47; 179-1 at ¶ 39.) As noted above, it is difficult to establish that a defendant had cause to retaliate against a plaintiff for filing a grievance against a third party. Wright, 554 F.3d at 274. Plaintiff has offered no evidence as to why Lee would retaliate for grievances against Delutis and Brown.
Furthermore, [*80]  assuming for purposes of this motion that the reach of the First Amendment right to access to court extends to Plaintiff's request to retrieve legal papers that were in storage for a pending court action and his request for legal supplies, for purposes of finding protected conduct, Lee has denied having any authority to, or involvement in, moving Plaintiff out of 4 Company, has denied planting a weapon in Plaintiff's cell, and has stated that he never denied Plaintiff legal supplies. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at ¶¶ 14, 17-18.) Plaintiff has submitted nothing more than his conclusory accusations, which are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. See Flaherty, 713 F.2d at 13 (claims of retaliation must be supported by specific facts; conclusory statements are not sufficient). Moreover, temporal proximity alone is insufficient to avoid summary judgment. See Roseboro, 791 F.Supp. 2d at 370.
In his July 11, 2012, grievance Plaintiff claims that Lee verbally harassed and threatened him. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 254; 157-8 at 48-51.) Verbal harassment is generally held not to rise to the level of adverse action for purposes of a retaliation claim. Roseboro, 791 F.Supp. 2d at 375. Plaintiff claims that Lee threatened him by telling Plaintiff that "I'm going to make sure you never get out of SHU. If you [*81]  make it to population, I going to make sure to take care of you." (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 254.) As discussed above with regard to the retaliation claim against Brown, verbal threats alone are generally not considered as adverse action for purposes of a retaliation claim unless they were specific and direct, Mateo, 682 F.Supp. 2d at 434, or as in Ford, 539 F. App'x at 5, where a vague threat enhances its effectiveness and increase the likelihood that a person of ordinary firmness would be deterred from filing other grievances. Unlike with Brown, who is the Deputy Superintendent of Security, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could not find that the very general threats allegedly made by Lee in the yard constitute adverse action for purposes of a retaliation claim.
In his second amended complaint, Plaintiff has claimed in conclusory fashion that Lee filed the June 27, 2012, IMR against him in retaliation for returning the allegedly planted weapon to Lucia. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 215.) In his July 11, 2012, grievance against Lee, Plaintiff has claimed, also in conclusory fashion, that Lee filed the false IMR in retaliation for Plaintiff filing the June 27, 2012, grievance. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at 14-21, 48-51.) However, Plaintiff's grievance was [*82]  not received by the grievance office until July 2, 2012, several days after Lee allegedly filed the IMR in retaliation for Plaintiff's June 27, 2012, grievance. Unless Lee knew about the grievance prior to the time he wrote the IMR, the IMR cannot be found to have been filed in retaliation for the grievance. See Seale, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24519, 2015 WL 667531, at 22.
Plaintiff claimed in his July 11, 2012, grievance that Lee saw him writing the grievance on June 27, 2012. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at 48.) The Court finds that Plaintiff's conclusory assertion that Lee saw him writing the grievance, without supporting evidence or at least more detailed factual support, fails to establish a nexus between Plaintiff's return of the weapon to Lucia and the June 27, 2016, grievance, on the one hand, and Lee's IMR, on the other. See Jeffreys, 426 F.3d at 554 ("To defeat summary judgment . . . nonmoving parties may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation."). Based upon the foregoing, the Court recommends that Lee be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim.

E. Beaudette
Plaintiff has alleged that Beaudette retaliated against him for filing grievances by making his shower too hot and too short, denying him soap and a razor or electric clippers, [*83]  and by moving him from 4 Company to 2 Company in December 2012. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶¶ 263, 265, 299-302.) Plaintiff filed grievances against Beaudette complaining of the allegedly retaliatory hot and too short shower (Dkt. No. 157-9 at 12-13); retaliatory denial of showers, soap, razor, and clippers, id. at 34-35, 45, 53-54; retaliatory search of Plaintiff's cell, id. at 84; and an unjustified retaliatory move from 4 Company to 2 Company. Id. at 72-82.
The Court finds that denial of the limited number of showers claimed by Plaintiff as well as soap, razor, and clippers, does not constitute adverse action for purposes of a retaliation claim. See Pidlypchak, 389 F.3d at 381 (adverse action for purposes of retaliation is retaliatory conduct "that would deter a similarly situated individual of ordinary firmness from exercising . . . constitutional rights"). Furthermore, Plaintiff's claim that Beaudette was responsible for moving him from 4 Company to 2 Company has no evidentiary support in the record beyond Plaintiff's conclusory assertion. See Flaherty, 713 F.2d at 13. The undisputed evidence in the record includes Beaudette's statement that as a correction officer he has no authority to transfer an inmate to another cell (Dkt. No 157-9 at ¶ 29), and a memorandum from R. Farrell that cell moves [*84]  in SHU must be approved by the security supervisor. Id. at 83. A February 9, 2013, memorandum from Beaudette to Farrell states that the cell search which Plaintiff claims was retaliatory was a daily random cell search ordered by the Deputy Superintendent of Security. Id. at 84. Plaintiff has submitted no evidence refuting the nature of the search.
In short, Defendants have established as a matter of law that there was is no adverse action supporting Plaintiff's retaliation claims against Beaudette regarding the shower, soap, razor, and clippers; that Beaudette had no authority to move Plaintiff from 4 Company; and that the search of Plaintiff's cell was a daily random search. Because Plaintiff has raised no material issues of fact in dispute, the Court recommends Beaudette be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

VII. EIGHTH AMENDMENT MEDICAL INDIFFERENCE CLAIM AGAINST LORDI AND CROSS

A. Legal Standard for a Medical Indifference Claim
Defendants have moved for summary judgment on the Eighth Amendment medical indifference claims Plaintiff has asserted against Defendants Lordi and Cross.25 (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 13-15; 157-14 at 22-24.)
Claims that prison officials have intentionally disregarded an inmate's serious medical [*85]  needs fall under the Eighth Amendment umbrella of protection from the imposition of cruel and unusual punishments. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994). Prison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate medical care. Id. (citing Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526-27, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 82 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1984)). A claim that a prison official has intentionally disregarded an inmate's serious medical needs has both objective and subjective elements. See Hathaway v. Coughlin, 99 F.3d 550, 553 (2d Cir. 1996). The plaintiff must show that he had a serious medical condition and that it was met with deliberate indifference. Chance v. Armstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 701 (2d Cir. 1998). "The objective 'medical need' element measures the severity of the alleged deprivation, while the subjective 'deliberate indifference' element ensures that the defendant prison official acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind." Smith v. Carpenter, 316 F.3d 178, 183-84 (2d Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). "[N]ot every lapse in medical care is a constitutional wrong. Rather, a prison official violates the Eighth Amendment only when the two requirements are met." Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 279 (2d Cir. 2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
A "serious medical condition" is "a condition of urgency, one that may produce death, degeneration, or extreme pain." Nance v. Kelly, 912 F.2d 605, 607 (2d Cir. 1990) (Pratt, J. dissenting) (citations omitted); accord Hathaway v. Coughlin, 37 F.3d 63, 66 (2d Cir. 1994); Chance v. Armstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 702 (2d Cir. 1998). Factors informing the inquiry into whether an alleged medical condition is sufficiently serious include, but are not limited to: (1) [*86]  the existence of an injury that a reasonable doctor or patient would find important and worthy of comment or treatment; (2) the presence of a medical condition that significantly affects an individual's daily activities; and (3) the existence of chronic and substantial pain. Chance,143 F.3d at 702-03.
To satisfy the subjective element of deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must establish the equivalent of criminal recklessness, i.e., "that the charged official act[ed] or fail[ed] to act while actually aware of a substantial risk that serious inmate harm will result." Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 280; see also Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837 ("[T]he official must be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.").

B. Lordi
Plaintiff spent the night in the infirmary at Upstate on July 21, 2011. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 163-64; 157-2 at 69-70.) According to Plaintiff, he was in the infirmary because he had been badly beaten by Monacelli and Laroque and sustained serious bodily injury to his face, shoulders, back, and ribs, including a large bump on his forehead, and was extremely dizzy. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶¶ 163-65.) The Infirmary Log for July 22, 2011, however, indicates that Plaintiff had been sent to the [*87]  infirmary the night before because he was banging his head against the wall and making threats of self-harm. (Dkt. No. 157-5 at 12.) Plaintiff claims the log entry was a cover-up of the assault. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 169.)
Plaintiff claims that RN Lordi rejected his requests for medical help while she was present in the clinic speaking with a correctional officer outside Plaintiff's room the morning of July 22, 2011. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 166-168; 157-2 at 70-71.) According to Plaintiff, he told Lordi that he had severe injuries from being hit in the head and needed a doctor. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 71.) Plaintiff contends that Lordi, who did not come into his room, told him from the hall that she did not see any injury and began screaming at him about attacking an officer at Green Haven. Id.
According to Lordi, on July 22, 2011, the nurses assigned to the infirmary were responsible for inmates housed in the infirmary. (Dkt. No. 157-5 at ¶ 12.) According to the Infirmary Log for July 22, 2011, the nursing staff assigned to the infirmary were Amy Cushman and Martha Sturgeon. Id. at ¶ 11. Lordi's name does not appear in the Infirmary Log for July 22, 2011, and she was assigned to provide nursing [*88]  care to inmates in 8 Building. Id. at ¶ 10. Although Lordi would have been in the infirmary at various times throughout the day on July 22, 2011, to retrieve medications, at no time did her job responsibilities entail providing medical care to inmates housed in the infirmary, and she spent the majority of the day in 8 Building. Id. at ¶ 13. According to Lordi, had she been in the infirmary on July 22, 2011, and felt that Plaintiff needed emergency medical care, she would have provided the care or taken steps to ensure the care was provided. Id. at ¶ 14.
The record evidence reveals that Plaintiff was on special watch during the night he spent in the infirmary, requiring the correctional officer assigned to him to enter his observations on a Special Watch Log every fifteen minutes. (Dkt. 157-13 at ¶¶ 7 and 8 and pp. 5-7.) Furthermore, records reveal that Plaintiff was offered a sick call by RN Surgeon at 6:15am on July 22, 2011, and was seen by a mental health specialist approximately three hours later. Id. at ¶ 10.
Whether or not Plaintiff sustained injuries as severe as he claims as a result of the alleged assault by Monacelli and Laroque remains open to question. The investigation report [*89]  on Plaintiff's assault which was prepared by Investigator Weishaupt disputed Plaintiff's claim of serious injury, concluding that his medical records and photographs did not show the substantial injuries Plaintiff should have had if the assaults he described were as brutal and lengthy as he claimed. (Dkt. No. 157-12 at ¶ 7 and p. 17.)
However, even assuming for purposes of this motion that Plaintiff did have a serious medical condition on July 22, 2011, the evidence reveals that Lordi was not a "charged" official who failed to provide Plaintiff medical care, since her work assignment was in 8 Building, and medical care was available and offered to Plaintiff by RN Surgeon, one of the nurses who was assigned to the infirmary. See Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 280 (plaintiff must establish that the charged official acted or failed to act while actually aware of a substantial risk of serious harm).
Based upon the record evidence, the Court finds that a jury could not reasonably conclude that Lordi acted with deliberate indifference, and therefore recommends Lordi be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment medical indifference claim.

C. Cross
1. Medical Indifference Claim
According to Plaintiff's medical records, he had surgery [*90]  for "anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with Achilles allograft and with medial and lateral meniscectomies" on December 20, 2006. (Dkt. No. 111-6 at 11-13.) The operative report indicates the surgery was the second attempt at reconstructing Plaintiff's ACL. Id. at 11. He complained of pain, his knee giving way, swelling, limping, and frequent falls after the first surgery. Id. at 2. Plaintiff had a third knee surgery on June 1, 2007, to remove a screw. Id. at 27-29. He was provided with a knee brace after the surgery. Id. at 3. Plaintiff saw Orthopedic Surgeon Harrison in or about March of 2008. Id. at 2-8. He complained of pain, swelling, unsteadiness of his knee which still gave way, and stiffness and limitation of motion. Id. at 3. With his knee giving way and buckling, Plaintiff had a tendency to fall. (Dkt. No. 111-6 at 8.) Dr. Harrison indicated that Plaintiff had never fully recovered from his knee injury and had to be allowed to wear a knee brace. Id. He recommended that further stabilization surgery be attempted, with the likelihood that Plaintiff would ultimately require a total knee replacement. Id.
Plaintiff had also complained to Dr. Harrison about pain in his lower back which Plaintiff attributed to his limping. [*91]  Id. at 3. An MRI of Plaintiff's lumbar spine done on September 19, 2005, showed mild to moderate disc degeneration at L4-L5 and a diffusely bulging disc at L4-L5. Id. at 5.
Plaintiff claims that from early February 2013 to early May 2013, Cross refused to allow him to sit on the bed to put on his knee brace, instead requiring him to sit on the floor to put on the brace, which caused Plaintiff considerable back pain. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 272-83; 179-1 at ¶ 50.) Cross continued to refuse even after Plaintiff told him sitting on the floor to put the brace on caused him excruciating pain. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 272.) At his deposition, when asked if he could put his knee brace on while sitting on the floor, Plaintiff testified "[n]o, I never try. I tried one time and I almost fall. So I never try again because I can't. By medical order I can't do that. It's difficult. The knee brace, the day I tried, the knee brace went all the way down to my ankle and I almost fall." (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 197.)
According to Plaintiff, because he needed to sit on a chair to put on his brace properly, most of the time he had to go to recreation without his brace, or with it on improperly, and simply stand in the corner of the recreation [*92]  cage even in cold weather. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 273; 157-2 at 197-98; 179-1 at ¶¶ 50-51.) Plaintiff testified at his deposition that Cross made him sit on the dirty floor in the back of his cell to put his knee brace on because Plaintiff filed too many complaints and requested the video every time a violation was committed against him. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 195.)
Cross explained in his declaration that Plaintiff's knee brace was frisked and searched for contraband and placed in the back of Plaintiff's cell when it was removed by Plaintiff. (Dkt. No. 157-6 at ¶ 26.) Allowing Plaintiff to sit on his bed to put the brace on would cause a security breach because Plaintiff would be out of sight while putting it on, thereby nullifying the frisk search on the brace. Id. at ¶ 27. Moreover, according to Cross, because of his history of violent and assaultive behavior, Plaintiff was not allowed to keep the brace in his cell and was required to put it on under the observation of an officer. Id. at ¶ 25; Dkt. No. 157-2 at 191. Plaintiff claims that he could be observed sitting on his bed from the front of his cell. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 272.)
Cross asserted in his declaration that medical staff had not [*93]  placed any restrictions on how Plaintiff's knee brace was to be applied, and it was Cross's understanding that Plaintiff could stand or sit on the floor in the back of his cell. (Dkt. 157-6 at ¶ 24.) According to Cross, on a daily basis, Plaintiff was able to walk to the recreation area without his knee brace and walk around inside the recreation pen for an hour without his brace or cane. Id. at ¶ 32.
On March 11, 2013, Cross issued a memorandum to staff advising them that Plaintiff had a permit for a knee brace for out of cell use, the brace was to be secured in the back of his cell, and it was to be put on by Plaintiff in the back of his cell. Id. at 139. In the memorandum, Cross informed staff that "Medical staff stated Inmate Quezada does not have any restrictions on how he puts the knee brace on; he can stand up or sit on the floor, in the back of his cell. He does not need to sit on his bed or have a chair or stool in the back of his cell." Id. (emphasis in original). In a May 14, 2013, memorandum to the grievance supervisor, Cross indicated that he contacted medical staff and was informed Plaintiff did not have to sit down to put on his knee brace. Id. at 138. Plaintiff, however, testified at his [*94]  deposition that the doctor ordered him to sit down when he put his knee brace on, but Cross refused to allow him to do so. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 194.)
On May 6, 2013, when he did not have his knee brace on, Plaintiff slipped and fell on a wet spot in front of the shower when his knee gave out. (Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 53.) The same day Deputy Superintendent of Security Brown directed that a plastic bucket be placed in the back of Plaintiff's cell for him to sit on while he put on his knee brace. Id. at ¶ 33; Dkt. No. 111 at 98.
2. Analysis
Based upon Plaintiff's medical records regarding his surgeries, the lack of stability of his knee, and the order by Dr. Harrison that Plaintiff wear the brace, the Court finds there is a question of fact as to whether Plaintiff had a serious medical need that required him to wear a knee brace when he walked around outside his cell. (Dkt. No. 111-6 at 8.) The Court also finds there is a material factual dispute as to whether Plaintiff was able to put the knee brace on while sitting on the floor, with Plaintiff claiming that he could not because of the pain to his back and because he could not put it on properly and it would slip down. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 272; [*95]  157-2 at 197.)
Moreover, the Court finds that there are issues of material fact as to whether Cross was deliberately indifferent to whether Plaintiff was able to properly put on the knee brace sitting on the floor, whether doing so would cause Plaintiff excruciating pain, and the risk to Plaintiff's safety of walking around without his knee brace. Cross has indicated that there was a security reason behind not allowing Plaintiff to sit on his bed when he put on the knee brace. (Dkt. No. 157-6 at ¶ 32.) However, he has identified no security issue involved in refusing to allow Plaintiff to sit on something in the back of his cell so that he could wear the brace to protect himself from falls like the one he took on May 6, 2013, caused in part by the instability of his knee described by Dr. Harrison. (Dkt. No. 111-6 at 8.) Cross appears to have gone out of his way to prevent anyone from giving Plaintiff something to sit on in the back of his cell, even though he was aware that Plaintiff was going out on a daily basis, to walk to the recreation area without his knee brace and to walk around inside the recreation pen for an hour without his brace or cane. (Dkt. 157-6 at ¶ 32 and p. 139.) [*96]  In contrast, Brown ordered that a bucket be placed in the back of Plaintiff's cell for him to sit on when he put on his knee brace immediately after Plaintiff fell because he was not wearing the brace and his knee gave out when he slipped on some water. (Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 33.)
Because the Court finds that there are material issues of fact in dispute as to both the objective and subjective elements of Plaintiff' Eighth Amendment medical indifference claim against Cross, it recommends that Cross be denied summary judgment on the claim.

VIII. EIGHTH AMENDMENT CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT CLAIM AGAINST BEAUDETTE

A. Legal Standard
"While the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment 'does not mandate comfortable prisons,' the conditions must at least be humane." Gaston v. Coughlin, 249 F.3d 156, 164 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 349, 101 S. Ct. 2392, 69 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1981). "Prisoners live every aspect of their lives completely under the State's control, and the State must exercise that control in accordance with society's standards of decency. Those standards dictate that the conditions of confinement in American prisons "must not involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain." Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 347.
To establish a claim under the Eighth Amendment based upon conditions of confinement, an inmate must allege that: "(1) objectively, the deprivation [*97]  the inmate suffered was sufficiently serious that he was denied the minimal civilized measures of life's necessities, and (2) subjectively, the defendant official acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind . . ., such as deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety." Walker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119, 125 (2d Cir. 2013) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) As to the objective element, an inmate must show "that the conditions, either alone or in combination, pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his health." Id. Prison officials violate the Eighth Amendment when they "deprive an inmate of his 'basic human needs' such as food, clothing, medical care, and safe and sanitary living conditions." Id. (quoting Phelps v. Kapnolas, 308 F.3d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 2002) (per curiam)). There is no "static test" for determining whether a deprivation is serious enough to violate an inmate's Eighth Amendment rights. Id. (citing Jabbar v. Fischer, 683 F.3d 54, 57 (2d Cir. 2012)). "The conditions themselves must be evaluated in light of contemporary standards of decency." Jabbar, 683 F.3d at 57 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
To constitute deliberate indifference under the subjective element, "[t]he prison official must know of, and disregard, an excessive risk to inmate health or safety. Jabbar, 683 F.3d at 57; see also Trammell v. Keane, 338 F.3d 155, 162-63 (2d Cir. 2003) (the state of mind for the subjective element in cases involving [*98]  prison conditions is "deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety."). Mere negligence is not enough. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835.

B. Analysis of Claim
Plaintiff claims that on July 3, 2012, when Defendant Beaudette took him to the shower, Plaintiff complained to him that the shower was too hot and he could suffer burns if he got in. (Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 42.) Rather than adjust the temperature, Beaudette told Plaintiff his shower was over. Id. On August 14, 2012, Beaudette took Plaintiff to the shower, and the water was again too hot. Id. at ¶ 43. Beaudette checked the water with his hand and told him Plaintiff it was good. Id. He then told Plaintiff he was crying too much so the shower was over. Id.
According to Beaudette, Plaintiff was allowed ten minutes to shower in compliance with DOCCS Directive 4933. (Dkt. No. 157-9 at ¶ 9.) In his declaration, Beaudette references an August 20, 2012, grievance filed by Plaintiff complaining that he was denied a full shower and that the water was too hot on August 19, 2012.26 Id. at ¶ 7 and pp. 12-13. The Superintendent denied the grievance noting that staff present for the showers had gone on record and denied the allegations by Plaintiff, and that staff members had [*99]  stated that shower temperatures are adjusted to inmate request. Id. at 10. CORC upheld the Superintendent's determination. Id. at 7.
The Court finds that even if, contrary to Beaudette's assertion, the water was too hot for Plaintiff to comfortably shower on two occasions, and Plaintiff's shower time on those days was shorter than required under the DOCCS Directive, no reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff has satisfied the objective requirement for an Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim. See, e.g., Barnes v. County of Monroe, 85 F.Supp. 3d 696, 738 (W.D.N.Y. 2015) (holding four-day suspension of showers does not state Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim); McCoy v. Goord, 255 F.Supp. 2d 233, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (dismissal of conditions of confinement claim because a two-week suspension of shower privileges did not suffice as a denial of a "basic hygienic need"). Therefore, the Court recommends that Beaudette be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim

IX. ADA AND RA CLAIMS

A. Legal Standards for Claims Under Title II of the ADA and the RA
Title II of the ADA provides in relevant part that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be [*100]  subjected to discrimination by any such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. "The purpose of [Title II of the ADA] is to 'eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability and to ensure evenhanded treatment between the disabled and able-bodied.'" Maccharulo v. New York State Dept. of Corr. Servs., No. 08 Civ 301 (LTS), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73312, 2010 WL 2899751, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 21, 2010) (quoting Doe v. Pfrommer, 148 F.3d 73, 82 (2d Cir. 1998)). Under Title II of the ADA, a defendant discriminates when it fails to make a reasonable accommodation that would permit a qualified disabled individual "to have access to and take a meaningful part in public services." Powell v. Nat'l Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 364 F.3d 79, 85 (2d Cir 2004), corrected at 511 F.3d 238 (2d Cir. 2004); Disabled In Action v. Board of Elections of New York, 752 F.3d 189, 197 (2d Cir. 2014) ("A public entity discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when it fails to provide 'meaningful access' to its benefits, programs, or services.")
The RA prohibits disability discrimination using language similar to Title II of the ADA. Section 794(a) provides "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, or be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Like Title II of the ADA, "the Rehabilitation Act requires specified 'otherwise qualified' disabled individuals receive reasonable accommodations from programs receiving [*101]  federal financial assistance." Harris v. Mills, 572 F. 3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301, 105 S. Ct. 712, 83 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1985)). Because the elements of Plaintiff's ADA and RA claims for disability discrimination are the same, the Court considers these claims together and applies a single analysis to both. See Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F.3d 611, 618 (2d Cir. 1999) ("Because Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA impose identical requirements, we consider these claims in tandem.").
In order to establish a claim under Title II of the ADA and the RA, Plaintiff must show "1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; 2) DOCCS is an entity subject to the acts; and 3) he was denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from DOCCS services, programs, or activities, or DOCCS otherwise discriminated against him by reason of his disability." Wright v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr., 831 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003)). Both Title II of the ADA and the RA apply to state prisons and their prisoners. Id. (citing Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 210, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1998)).
In examining an ADA claim, the court must ask whether a plaintiff with disabilities "as a practical matter" was denied "meaningful access" to services, programs, or activities to which he was "legally entitled." Henrietta D., 331 F.3d at 273. "Reasonable accommodations" must be made to "assure meaningful access." Choate, 469 U.S. at 301. "The hallmark of a reasonable accommodation is effectiveness." Wright, 831 F.3d at 72 (quoting Dean v. Univ. Sch. of Med. & Biomedical Scis, 804 F.3d 178, 189 (2d Cir. 2015)) (internal quotations omitted). "Specifically, [*102]  a reasonable accommodation need not be perfect or the most strongly preferred by the plaintiff, but it still must be effective. Determining the reasonableness of an accommodation is a fact-specific question that often must be resolved by a factfinder." Id. (internal citations, quotation marks and punctuation omitted).
A defendant is "entitled to summary judgment [on a Title II ADA claim] only if the undisputed record reveals that the plaintiff was accorded a 'plainly reasonable accommodation." Dean, 804 F.3d at 189 (quoting Noll v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 787 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir. 2015)).

B. Eleventh Amendment
State officials, like Cross, may not be sued in their individual capacities under either Title II of the ADA or the RA. See Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Sciences Center of Brooklyn, 280 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir. 2001). Furthermore, the Eleventh Amendment bars actions for money damages in federal court against a state or its officials when acting in their official capacity unless the state has waived its sovereign immunity or Congress has abrogated it.27 Dean, 804 F.3d at 193. Claims against state officials in their official capacities are treated as claims against the State. Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25, 112 S. Ct. 358, 116 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1991). Therefore, Plaintiff's ADA and RA claims against Cross are treated herein as claims against DOCCS.28
In Garcia, the Second Circuit recognized that Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress some authority to abrogate a state's sovereign immunity. Garcia, 280 F.3d at 111-12. The Court, in [*103]  determining how money claims under the ADA could be limited so as to comport with Congress's Section 5 authority, held "a private suit for money damages may only be maintained against the state [and its officials in their official capacities] if the plaintiff can establish that the Title II violation was motivated either by discriminatory animus or ill will due to disability." Id.
Subsequently, in United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 159, 126 S. Ct. 877, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2009), the Supreme Court held the enforcement power granted Congress under Section 5 "include[d] the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity by authorizing private suits for damages against the States" for conduct actually violating the Fourteenth Amendment. See also Bolmer v. Oliveira, 594 F.3d 134, 147 (2d Cir. 2010). In Georgia, the Court "explicitly left open the question of whether Congress may validly abrogate sovereign immunity with respect to a particular class of misconduct which violates Title II but does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment." Dean, 804 F.3d at 194-95.
The Second Circuit noted in Dean there was a "growing fracture among the district courts in this Circuit in their approach to determining whether Congress validly abrogated state sovereign immunity under Title II of the ADA," with some courts following the discriminatory animus standard set forth in Garcia and others the Fourteenth Amendment test in Georgia. 804 F.3d at 159. In analyzing Plaintiff's ADA [*104]  and RA claims for summary judgment purposes, the Court considers both.

C. Analysis of Plaintiff's ADA and RA Claims
1. Hearing Impairment
Plaintiff describes himself as a disabled inmate who has suffered from a hearing loss since childhood and wears hearings aids in both ears. (Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 48.) According to Plaintiff, after thirty days, inmates in SHU are issued earbuds to listen to radio and television. Plaintiff could not use the ear buds issued to him because he has hearing aids in both ears, so he requested headphones. Id. at ¶ at 49. Plaintiff also requested a shake alarm and visual smoke detector. (Dkt. No. 157-6 at 150.)
On November 1, 2012, Plaintiff filed a grievance against Clinton Superintendent LaValley complaining that he had been denied reasonable accommodations for his hearing impairment including headphones, a shake alarm, and a visual smoke detector. Id. at 149-51. The IGRC found Plaintiff had not submitted a reasonable accommodation form with regard to the headphones. Id. at 155. The Superintendent responded that Plaintiff had been provided with reasonable accommodation forms and Plaintiff's form was received by the Deputy Superintendent of Programs on December 6, 2012. (Dkt. No. 157-6 [*105]  at 156.)
According to CORC's April 24, 2013, decision on appeal, Plaintiff's reasonable request form had been denied by the Superintendent because the headphones and shake alarm clock were not medically indicated. Id. at 146. CORC noted Plaintiff had been seen by audiologist on January 18, 2013, and his hearing aids were found to be functioning properly. Id. Moreover, Plaintiff was designated with a non-significant hearing loss and was entitled only to hearing aids and preferred seating. Id.
The determination Plaintiff did not need headphones, even though he could not use the standard ear buds because his hearing aids were in his ears, seems questionable. (see Dkt. No. 179-7 at 70.) Nonetheless, the Court finds only conclusory evidence in the summary judgment record that DOCCS denied Plaintiff's request out of discriminatory animus or ill will due to his disabilities. Rather, the Court finds that the denial was based on the audiologist's findings regarding the degree of Plaintiff's hearing impairment and his needs. (Dkt. No. 157-6 at 146.) See Garcia, 280 F.3d at 111-12. The same is true with regard to the shake alarm and visual smoke detector. Given the audiologist's determination that Plaintiff's hearing loss was non-significant, [*106]  and Plaintiff was only entitled to hearing aids and preferred seating, and DOCCS's reliance on the audiologist in denying Plaintiff's request for the headphones, shake alarm, and a visual smoke alarm, the evidence does not support a finding of deliberate indifference on the part of DOCCS and its officials sufficient to support an Eighth Amendment medical indifference or conditions of confinement claim. See Nance, 912 F.2d at 607 (medical indifference); Walker, 717 F.3d at 125 (conditions of confinement). Therefore, the Court concludes no reasonable jury would find Plaintiff's substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were violated under Georgia, 546 U.S. at 159, by denial of the headphones (Dkt. No. 157-6 at 146), and recommends Plaintiff's hearing impairment claim under the ADA and RA be found barred under the Eleventh Amendment.
2. Plaintiff's Remaining ADA and RA claims
Plaintiff claims DOCCS violated the ADA and RA by denying him housing in 4 Company where he would have a shower in the back of his cell instead of having to walk to the shower; forcing Plaintiff to sit on the floor in the back of his cell to put on his knee brace, resulting in his knee brace being unavailable for recreation; and denying Plaintiff a shower chair to accommodate his physical impairments. (Dkt. [*107]  Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 266-83; 179-1 at ¶¶ 49-52, 55, 57.)
The evidence is clear that Plaintiff's knee has a significant physical impairment as the result of an ACL tear which multiple surgeries were unable to repair, and Plaintiff is therefore a qualified individual with a disability. (Dkt. No. 111-6 at 2-8, 11-13, 27-29.) According to Dr. Harrison, Plaintiff's knee was unstable and required further stabilization surgery. Id. at 8. Dr. Harrison indicated that Plaintiff had to be allowed to use a knee brace. Id. It is also clear that both the ADA and RA apply to state prisons and their prisoners. Yeskey, 524 U.S. at 210. Therefore, the only issue before the Court for consideration is whether Plaintiff was denied the opportunity to participate in and benefit from DOCCS's services, programs, or activities, or discriminated against by DOCCS by reason of his disability. Wright, 831 F.3d at 72.
a. 4 Company Reasonable Accommodation
In January of 2012, Plaintiff was housed in a company in Unit 14 which did not have showers in the cells, requiring him to walk down the hall to take a shower. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶¶ 221-223.) Plaintiff filed a grievance seeking reasonable accommodations in the form of a move to 4 Company, in which the cells had showers in the [*108]  back, to accommodate his physical disabilities. Id. Plaintiff filed a reasonable accommodations form requesting the move to 4 Company so he could take showers in his cell in early February 2012, and his request was granted on February 22, 2012, resulting in Plaintiff's move to 4 Company. (Dkt. Nos. 157-6 at 16; 157-8 at 35.)
By the end of 2012, Plaintiff had been moved in and out of 4 Company on two occasions. Plaintiff was first moved out of 4 Company in June 2012, allegedly for consistently poor attitude and behavior towards other inmates, and subsequently moved back in and moved out again in December 2012, allegedly because excess state property was found in his cell on two occasions. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶¶ 244-246; 157-6 at ¶ 17; 157-9 at 86.) There is no indication in the record that Plaintiff returned to 4 Company during his remaining time in Clinton.
Plaintiff's grievance complaining of being moved from 4 Company in June 2012 was denied by Superintendent LaValley who found that "[a]ll needs for grievant are being addressed and accommodated." (Dkt. No. 157-6 at 14-16, 22.) CORC affirmed, finding that Plaintiff "received reasonable accommodations allowing him to shower on the block." Id. at 9 [*109] . Plaintiff also filed a grievance complaining, inter alia, of the December 2012, removal from 4 Company for the alleged possession of contraband. (Dkt. No. 157-9 at 72-82.) In its decision denying Plaintiff's grievance, CORC advised Plaintiff that "no inmate has the right to a specific housing location and that internal moves are conducted for security reasons." Id. at 68.
The Court has found no evidence in the record suggesting the reasonable accommodation approval for 4 Company had been rescinded, and no mention of the reasonable accommodation by either the Superintendent or CORC in the decisions on the grievances. Id. at 9, 22, 68, 71. Nonetheless, the Court finds no clear evidence in the summary judgment record before it establishing that DOCCS was motivated by either "discriminatory animus or ill will due to disability" in removing Plaintiff from 4 Company in June or December of 2012, although Plaintiff has made that claim in many of his grievances involving reasonable accommodations. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 111-5 at 29-30; 157-6 at 14-15; 157-8 at 48; 157-9 at 72.) See Garcia, 280 F.3d at 111-12. However, given the documented issues with Plaintiff's knee and the February 22, 2012, reasonable accommodation finding, both of which were known to DOCCS, the Court does find an issue for the factfinder as to whether Plaintiff has an Eighth Amendment medical indifference or conditions of confinement claim with regard to denial of 4 Company housing for purposes of finding abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity as a result of a deprivation of substantive due process under the [*110]  Fourteenth Amendment,. See Georgia, 546 U.S. at 159.
Cross, in his official capacity, is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA and RA claims regarding housing only if "the undisputed record reveals that plaintiff was accorded a 'plainly reasonable accommodation'" in 3 Company and 2 Company where he was housed before and after being removed from 4 Company. Dean, 804 F.3d at 189. The Court finds issues of fact regarding whether the housing areas other than 4 Company provided Plaintiff meaningful access to the shower, particularly in light of the February 22, 2012, finding that 4 Company, where Plaintiff had a shower in the back of his cell, provided a reasonable accommodation for his well-documented knee problem.
The Court further finds there is a factual issue regarding whether moving Plaintiff out of 4 Company was warranted for security reasons. See Wright, 831 F.3d at 75 ("While we are sensitive to the fact that prisons are unique environments with heightened security and safety concerns (citation omitted), because the ADA and RA 'unmistakably' apply to State prisons and prisoners (citation omitted), DOCCS is statutorily required to ensure that all of their inmates . . . have the opportunity effectively to access the services and programs DOCCS provides.")
Therefore, the [*111]  Court recommends that Cross, in his official capacity, be denied summary judgement on Plaintiff's ADA and RA claims regarding housing in 4 Company.
b. Putting on the Knee Brace
Plaintiff's claim regarding Cross not allowing him to sit on his bed while putting his knee brace on or providing something on which Plaintiff could sit in the back of his cell has been covered in detail in connection with the analysis of Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment medical indifference claim against Cross. The Court found an issue of material fact with regard to the medical indifference claim and recommended denial of summary judgment. The same issue of fact is present in determining whether Plaintiff's ADA and RA claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. See Georgia, 546 U.S. at 159.
The Court finds that Defendants have failed to establish entitlement to summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA and RA claims regarding his knee brace. Under the ADA and RA, inmates are entitled to meaningful access to recreational activities. See Wright, 831 F.3d at 72. Plaintiff claims he was unable to put the brace on sitting on the floor, forcing him to spend his limited recreation time standing in the corner of the recreation area rather than being able to walk around. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 273; 157-2 at [*112]  197-98; 179-1 at ¶¶ 50-51.) The Court finds material issues of fact in dispute regarding whether denying Plaintiff the reasonable accommodation of something on which to sit in the back of his cell while he put on his knee brace for a three month period denied him meaningful access to DOCCS provided recreation in violation of the ADA and RA and recommends denial of summary judgment on that part of Plaintiff's ADA and RA claim.
c. Shower Chair
Plaintiff complains that his request for a shower chair as a reasonable accommodation for his knee was denied by DOCCS in violation of the ADA and RA. (Dkt. No. 111 at 156.) When Brown ordered that a bucket be placed in the back of Plaintiff's cell to sit on while putting on his knee brace following Plaintiff's May 6, 2013, fall, Sgt. Farrell wrote on the staff memorandum "Do not remove for showers," depriving Plaintiff of use of the bucket to sit on in the shower. (Dkt. No. 111-6 at 98.) On November 21, 2013, a request to transfer Plaintiff to a facility that could accommodate a recommendation that he be provided with access to a shower with handrails was approved, and Plaintiff was transferred to Five Points Correctional Facility ("Five Points"). [*113]  (Dkt. No. 111-7 at 32.) Plaintiff's grievance requesting that relief was granted by CORC. Id. at 23. The record reveals that in or about May 2015, Plaintiff was given a shower chair as a reasonable accommodation at Five Points. (Dkt. Nos. 179-5 at 21, 24.) At his deposition, Plaintiff testified he had a shower chair in his shower at the back of his cell at Five Points as a reasonable accommodation for his knee problems. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 184.)
As with Plaintiff's housing accommodation claim the Court finds no clear evidence in the summary judgment record establishing that DOCCS was motivated by either "discriminatory animus or ill will due to disability" in refusing to provide Plaintiff with a shower chair, although Plaintiff claims it to be so. (Dkt. No. 157-6 at 14-20.) See Garcia, 280 F.3d at 111-12. However, as with Plaintiff's housing accommodation claim, the Court does find an issue for the factfinder as to whether Plaintiff has an Eighth Amendment medical indifference or conditions of confinement claim with regard to denial of the shower chair for purposes of finding abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment, given the documented issues with regard to Plaintiff's knee, and his need for a knee brace, back brace, and cane. (Dkt. No. 11-6 at 2-8, 11-13, [*114]  27-29.) See Georgia, 546 U.S. at 159.
Plaintiff, like all other inmates was entitled to meaningful access to the showers at DOCCS. See, e.g., Alster v. Goord, 745 F.Supp. 2d 317, 339 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (involving an inmate's wheel-chair access to the shower). Plaintiff claims that because of his knee, he could not stand in the shower and was required to sit on the dirty floor because he was denied a shower chair at Clinton. (Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 55.) The Court finds this is not a case where an "undisputed record reveals [P]laintiff was accorded a 'plainly reasonable accommodation'" for showering with his physically impaired knee, Wright, 831 F.3d at 73, and recommends that Cross, in his official capacity, be denied summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA and RA claims, with the exception of his hearing impairment claim wherein the Court has recommended summary judgment be granted.

X. PLAINTIFF'S SEXUAL ASSAULT CLAIM AGAINST LEE
Plaintiff has alleged that on August 7, 2012, Defendant Lee ordered him to assume the pat frisk position against the wall. (Dkt. Nos. 111 at ¶ 257; 179-1 at ¶ 40.) Plaintiff is disabled and walks with a cane, wears a knee brace, back brace, and medical boots. Id. His mobility is seriously limited, and when Lee told him to take additional steps away from the wall and spread his legs [*115]  more, Plaintiff told Lee he could not spread his legs more due to his disabilities. Id. Lee grabbed Plaintiff's left leg and deliberately pushed it to the left side to force Plaintiff to spread his legs beyond his capability. Id. Lee began the frisk search and maliciously grabbed Plaintiff's genitals. Id. At is deposition, Plaintiff testified that Lee sexually abused him by grabbing his testicle, but did not penetrate him. (Dkt. No. 157-2 at 208.) Plaintiff claims he did not go into the yard because he was in excruciating pain in his legs and testicles and ultimately required pain medication. (Dkt. No. 1 79-1 at ¶ 40.)
According to Plaintiff that was not the first time Lee had conducted a sexually abusive pat frisk. Another time during a pat frisk, Lee grabbed Plaintiff's testicles and squeezed, causing Plaintiff a lot of pain. (Dkt. No. 111 at ¶ 259.) Plaintiff also claims that on an unspecified occasion, Lee told him that if Plaintiff would show Lee his genitals, Lee would stop fucking with him. Id.; see also Dkt. No. 179-1 at ¶ 41.
Lee stated in his declaration that Plaintiff's claim that he sexually assaulted Plaintiff during a pat frisk is completely false. (Dkt. No. 157-8 at ¶ [*116]  4.) According to Lee, on August 7, 2012, Lee pat frisked Plaintiff before he went out for recreation as required by Directives 4910 and 4933. Id. at ¶¶ 27 and 28. Lee claims to have pat frisked Plaintiff as he did all pat frisks, in full compliance with the directives, and he never forced Plaintiff's legs apart or grabbed his leg during the frisk. Id. at ¶ 29. Lee denies intentionally touching or squeezing Plaintiff's genitals during the August 7, 2012, pat frisk or any other pat frisks, and Lee denied telling Plaintiff that if Plaintiff showed him his genitals, Lee would stop bothering him. Id. at ¶ 30.
"Because sexual abuse of a prisoner by a corrections officer may constitute serious harm inflicted by an officer with a sufficiently culpable state of mind, allegations of such abuse are cognizable as Eighth Amendment claims." Boddie v. Schnieder, 105 F.3d 857, 861 (2d Cir. 1997). In Crawford v. Cuomo, 796 F.3d 252, 257-58 (2d Cir. 2015), the Second Circuit wrote that "[i]n determining whether an Eighth Amendment violation has occurred, the principal inquiry is whether the contact is incidental to legitimate official duties, such as a justifiable pat frisk or strip search, or by contrast whether it is undertaken to arouse or gratify the officer or humiliate the inmate." The Court explained that:
To be sure, prison officials [*117]  looking for contraband may subject inmates to reasonable strip searches and cavity searches. (citation omitted). Indeed prison security and safety may require frequent searches of an intensely personal nature and not every search is properly the subject of a lawsuit. Searches that do not uncover contraband may be no less penologically justified than those that do. And even an officer who is meticulous in conducting a search does not violate an inmate's constitutional right as long as the officer had no intention of humiliating the inmate or deriving sexual arousal or gratification from the contact. But a search may not be undertaken maliciously or for the purposes of sexually abusing an inmate.
Id. at 258.
The evidence shows that Lee was performing a legitimate official duty in conducting a required pat frisk on Plaintiff on August 7, 2012, and there is no evidence in the record that supports a finding that Lee was deriving sexual arousal or intended to humiliate Plaintiff allegedly grabbing Plaintiff's testicles. Moreover, the Court finds that Plaintiff's vague claim that Lee had also grabbed Plaintiff's testicles on a pat frisk on an earlier occasion, without more, is inadequate to show a pattern [*118]  of sexual abuse by Lee.
The Court construes Plaintiff's claim that Lee told him he would stop bothering Plaintiff if Plaintiff showed Lee his genitals as one for verbal sexual harassment. The Court notes that Plaintiff has offered no evidence placing the comment allegedly made by Lee in any particular context or time frame that would tend to show a connection to the pat frisks alleged by him. District courts in the Second Circuit have held that isolated instances of improper verbal sexual harassment, with no allegation of contact or physical harm, "while clearly distasteful is not severe enough to be objectively, sufficiently serious." Phelan v. Durniak, No. 9:10-CV-666 (FJS/RFT), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133968, 2014 WL 4759937, at * 6 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2014) (quoting Boddie, 105 F.3d at 861); see also Brown v. Annucci, No. 9:16-CV-0808 (TJM/ATB), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37444, 2017 WL 1040416, at * 2 (N.D.N.Y. March 16, 2017) (dismissing plaintiff's verbal sexual harassment claim where he did not claim he was touched or physically harmed in any manner from the verbal sexual harassment).
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to raise an issue of material fact as to his Eighth Amendment sexual abuse claim against Lee and recommends that Lee be granted summary judgment on the claim.
ACCORDINGLY, it is hereby
RECOMMENDED that Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 157) [*119]  be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part; and it is further
