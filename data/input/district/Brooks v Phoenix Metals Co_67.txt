Opinion



ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is presently before the Court on Plaintiff Stanley Brooks's motion for sanctions [Doc. 55] and Defendant Phoenix Metals Company's ("Phoenix Metals")1 motion for summary judgment [Doc. 60]. For the following reasons, the Court DENIES the motion for sanctions and RECOMMENDS that the motion for summary judgment be GRANTED.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
In this employment action, Brooks brings claims for interference and retaliation, arising under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), and discrimination and retaliation, under [*2]  the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). [Docs. 1, 40.] The following summary of facts is presented in the light most favorable to Brooks. See Lofton v. Sec'y of Dep't of Children & Family Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 809 (11th Cir. 2004). Where there is a conflict in the evidence, the Court accepts Brooks's evidence as true because he is the non-moving party. See Ruiz de Molina v. Merritt & Furman Ins. Agency, Inc., 207 F.3d 1351, 1356 (11th Cir. 2000) ("If there is a conflict between the plaintiff's and the defendant's allegations or in the evidence, the plaintiff's evidence is to be believed and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in his favor.").2

A. Background on Phoenix Metals
Phoenix Metals is a metals processor and distributor headquartered in Norcross, Georgia. (DSUMF ¶ 1.) It employs truck drivers to pick up and deliver metals from its vendors and customers. (DSUMF ¶ 3.) Its drivers are compensated by the number of stops they make, the miles they drive, and the pounds and skids they carry on their trucks. (DSUMF ¶ 4.) If a driver is delayed at a stop, he or she is also paid for the time spent waiting. (See Dep. of Stanley Brooks at 60-61.)
At the time relevant to this case, Phoenix Metals' dispatchers assigned drivers their routes and the specific stops along their routes. (Dep. of William Hellstein 17-18.) Phoenix Metals used "kind of a flexible [*3]  system," so drivers could ask for certain routes. (Id. at 17.) Some routes paid better than others. To reduce pay disparities among drivers of different routes, the routes were "shuffled around," so that drivers were required "to run bad routes from time to time" but also had "good routes." (Id.) Phoenix Metals also maintained a "forced dispatch" policy, which provided that a driver can be automatically fired for refusing to accept a dispatch to deliver or pick up a load. (DSUMF ¶¶ 64-65.) A driver did not have to accept a dispatch if he or she was sick or had reached the regulatory limit set forth in U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT"). (Decl. of Randall Gibson ¶ 15.)
About once a month, drivers asked Phoenix Metals' transportation manager, Bill Dyon, whether he could have another driver cover a stop. (Dep. of William Dyon at 65-66.) At least on some occasions, Dyon was able to accommodate such a request. (Id. at 66.)
Phoenix Metals' top supplier of specialty metals was Ta Chen, a facility located about five or six miles from the Phoenix Metals terminal in Norcross. (DSUMF ¶¶ 47-48; PSMF ¶ 42.) Dispatchers assigned two trips each day to Ta Chen, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. (Decl. [*4]  of Ronnie Murphy, Jr. ¶¶ 5-6.) The afternoon Ta Chen pickup should have taken a driver an hour roundtrip, but drivers could expect the trip to take additional time because Ta Chen employees did not always have the pickup ready when the driver arrived. (S. Brooks Dep. at 70-71.) The average afternoon Ta Chen trip took about 90 minutes roundtrip, although it could take longer. (Decl. of William Dyon ¶ 6; S. Brooks Dep. at 168-70.) When possible, dispatch tried to rotate the Ta Chen pickups among the drivers. (Murphy Decl. ¶ 6.)
DOT regulations allow a driver to work for 14 on-duty hours, with a 30 minute break. 49 C.F.R. § 395.3(a); (PSMF ¶ 10). A driver may spend 11 of those on-duty hours actually driving. 49 C.F.R. § 395.3(a); (PSMF ¶ 11). As relevant here, Phoenix Metals used a system called PeopleNet to track driver hours for purposes of those DOT regulations.3 (Hellstein Dep. at 51; Dyon Dep. at 12-14; Murphy Decl. ¶ 7.) Phoenix Metals also used PeopleNet to send text messages to drivers. (Murphy Decl. ¶ 7.) Supervisors and dispatchers accessed PeopleNet records through a web or phone application to track employees' locations and DOT hours. (Dyon Dep. at 13-14, 37; Murphy Decl. ¶ 7.)

B. Brooks's employment with Phoenix [*5]  Metals
For about ten years, Brooks worked as a truck driver at Phoenix Metals. (Pl. Resp. to DSUMF ¶ 16.) He worked directly for Phoenix Metals for about two years and, before that, for the companies that distributed Phoenix Metals' products before it brought its truck driving operation in-house. (DSUMF ¶ 16; Pl. Resp. to DSUMF ¶ 16; S. Brooks Dep. at 36-37.) During his first eight years, he drove night shifts, including the route from Norcross to Charlotte. (DSUMF ¶ 19; Pl. Resp. to DSUMF ¶ 19.) To spend more time with his family, he requested that Phoenix Metals allow him to drive a local day shift, and he was assigned the Northeast City Route. (DSUMF ¶¶ 20, 22.) The Northeast City Route also gave Brooks more opportunities to stretch his legs. (DSUMF ¶ 22.)
Brooks and other day shift drivers began and ended their work day at the Phoenix Metals warehouse in Norcross. (DSUMF ¶ 21.) As a day shift driver, Brooks was not expected to load his truck before departing for the day, because third shift employees preloaded his truck the night before. (DSUMF ¶ 24.) Brooks usually had to depart the Norcross facility at 5:30 am, although drivers were often delayed and departed after the 5:30 start [*6]  time. (DSUMF ¶ 23; Pl. Resp. to DSUMF ¶ 23.) Before leaving the Phoenix Metals terminal to begin work for the day, Brooks was expected to attach the trailer to his tractor unit, perform a pre-trip inspection, which could take about 15 to 20 minutes, and secure the loaded trailer, which could take between 35 minutes and about an hour, depending on the weather. (S. Brooks Dep. at 157-60.) Ostensibly, Brooks was supposed to log in to the PeopleNet system before beginning those tasks to report that he was on duty. (Dyon Dep. at 40.) He and other drivers were instructed, however, not to log in to PeopleNet until closer to their time of departure from the terminal so that they could "save" hours. (S. Brooks Dep. at 158; Dep. of Todd Brooks 94-95, 103-04, 120-22.) Thus, Brooks often delayed recording his time on duty for about thirty minutes or an hour. (See S. Brooks Dep. at 157-59.)
Brooks knew about and understood Phoenix Metals' forced dispatch policy. (DSUMF ¶ 65; S. Brooks Dep. at 69-70.) He also knew that, if he was "close on hours," he was supposed to notify his supervisors and return to the terminal. (S. Brooks Dep. at 183.)
Brooks experienced knee pain toward the end of his employment [*7]  with Phoenix Metals. (S. Brooks Dep. at 70, 79.) On one occasion, in May 2015, Brooks arrived at work in the morning, prepared his truck, and went into the terminal warehouse to retrieve his paperwork. (Id. at 92, 367-68.) He suddenly experienced shooting pain in his leg, causing his leg to give out. (Id. at 92.) He lay on a forklift while people gathered around him, and he told a driver supervisor, Randall Gibson, that he could not take the load. (Id. at 92-93.) Gibson allowed him to go home. (Id. at 93, 367.)
Brooks also left work early one day because of knee pain. He recalled, "[I] [c]ame back off of a route, and they wanted me to go somewhere and I told them I couldn't because I was hurting. And I went home." (S. Brooks Dep. at 120.) He could not recall the exact date on which this event happened but knew that it occurred before he applied for FMLA leave. (Id. at 368.) Ronnie Murphy, Jr., a dispatcher, also recalled this incident. (Murphy Decl. ¶ 21.) Brooks "told [Murphy] that his knee was hurting and that he wanted to go home. [Murphy] said OK and [Brooks] left." (Id.)
On several occasions during his employment with Phoenix Metals, Brooks was disciplined. [Doc. 60-18.] He received written warnings for failure to watch training videos, not [*8]  logging out of PeopleNet, departing late for his scheduled route, improperly loading his trailer, and delivering incorrect materials to customers. [Id.]

C. Brooks's FMLA request
On April 19, 2015, Brooks requested to take FMLA leave for knee surgery scheduled for June 1, 2015. [Doc. 60-19.] On May 7, 2015, the Phoenix Metals human resources department approved his FMLA request and authorized him to take leave from June 1, 2015, to August 24, 2015. [Id.] Phoenix Metals management knew about Brooks's FMLA leave because they approved his FMLA leave, and Brooks had discussed his upcoming leave with Murphy. (PSMF ¶¶ 1, 3a.) Brooks also discussed his knee pain with his supervisors and dispatchers. (PSMF ¶¶ 7-8.)

D. Brooks's termination
Brooks's last day driving for Phoenix Metals was May 21, 2015. [Doc. 60-9.] He arrived at work and began preparing his truck at 4:15 a.m., but, consistent with Phoenix Metals' instructions to delay logging into PeopleNet, Brooks did not sign in and begin logging "on duty" hours until 5:15 a.m. (S. Brooks Dep. at 157-59, 165.) Brooks was assigned 24 stops that day, while the previous two days he had been assigned only 12 to 13 stops. (PSMF ¶¶ 34-35; S. Brooks Dep. [*9]  at 61-62.)
That day, Phoenix Metals' dispatchers were Murphy and Jeff Franklin. (Murphy Decl. ¶ 2.) Dispatch assigned the afternoon Ta Chen pickup to Brooks. (Id. ¶¶ 13-14; Decl. of Jeffrey Franklin ¶ 10; see S. Brooks Dep. at 179.) Brooks did not want to go to Ta Chen. (S. Brooks Dep. at 72-73.) It is undisputed that Brooks refused to go to Ta Chen, but the parties disagree on the circumstances of that refusal. Because both of the parties' versions of events are relevant to their arguments, the Court presents Phoenix Metals' version of events in addition to Brooks's.
According to dispatcher Murphy, between 4:00 and 4:30 pm, dispatch sent Brooks a message through PeopleNet instructing him to make the Ta Chen pickup. (Murphy Decl. ¶ 13.) Later that afternoon, Phoenix Metals' transportation administrator Trevor Peterson saw Brooks at the terminal and asked him, in person, to make the Ta Chen run. (Id. ¶ 14.) Brooks stated that he wanted to go to the store to buy a cell phone and "complained that other drivers had gotten back before him and that one of them could have gone to make the stop." (Id.) A few minutes later, Brooks went into the dispatch office, and Murphy asked him to go to Ta [*10]  Chen. (Id. ¶¶ 15-16.) Brooks refused, explained that he wanted a new cell phone for work, and "complained that other drivers had gotten back before him and could have gone to make the stop." (Id. ¶ 16.) Brooks asked whether he was going to be fired or suspended from work because of his refusal to do the Ta Chen pickup, and when Murphy said that he did not know, Brooks left the terminal. (Id. ¶ 17.)
According to Brooks, he was assigned the Ta Chen pickup earlier. At about 3:20 pm, when he was back at the Phoenix Metals terminal in between stops, he told Murphy, "I can't go to Ta Chen. I'm hurting." (S. Brooks Dep. at 70, 176; see also id. at 344-45 (told Murphy he was hurting); 365 (same); 372-76 (same).) He also recalled that he told Murphy, "I'm not going to be able to go to Ta Chen. I'm going to be out of hours." (S. Brooks Dep. at 179; see also 176-77 (told Murphy he was out of hours); 362 (same); 365 (same); 372-75 (same). At the time, he did not mention that he wanted to buy a new phone, but he did eventually buy a phone after he left work that day. (Id. at 70, 94.) After his conversation with Murphy, Brooks made his next two stops and another pickup, completing all of his assignments except for the Ta [*11]  Chen pickup, and returned to the terminal at around 4:45 or 5:00 p.m. (Id. at 179-80.) Brooks logged out of PeopleNet and went "off duty" at 5:19 p.m. [Doc. 60-17.] He did not speak to anyone, took his personal belongings, and left work. (S. Brooks Dep. at 180.)4
After Brooks refused the Ta Chen pickup, dispatch had another driver, Gary Stephens, make the pickup after he returned from Chattanooga. (Murphy Decl. ¶ 19.) Stephens made the trip in one hour, although it appears that he did not have to make the first leg of the trip from Norcross to Ta Chen. [Doc. 60-25.] Stephens went on duty at 5:19 am on May 21 and went off duty at 7:18 pm, nearly 14 hours later. [Id.] Other Phoenix Metals drivers were available and could have made the Ta Chen pickup as well.5
That evening, Murphy called driver supervisor Gibson, who called Dyon, to report Brooks's refusal to go to Ta Chen. (Murphy Decl. ¶ 18; Gibson Decl. ¶¶ 11-12.) Murphy also called Dyon. (Gibson Decl. ¶ 12; Dyon Decl. ¶ 14.) Dyon asked Gibson to keep Brooks at the terminal in the morning so that he could discuss the issue with Brooks. (Dyon Decl. ¶ 14.)
The next day, May 22, Brooks reported to work at about 4:15 am and prepared his truck, but Gibson [*12]  asked him not to leave the terminal so that he could talk to transportation manager Dyon. (S. Brooks Dep. at 181.) Brooks waited for Dyon until about 6:00 or 7:00 am. (Id.) Brooks testified that, when Dyon arrived, he said "it look[s] like we're going to have to part ways." (Id. at 181.) Brooks asked why, and Dyon replied, "You refused a load." (Id.) Brooks explained that he was "out of hours" and had completed more than 22 stops, and Dyon responded, "That doesn't matter." (Id. at 181-82.) Dyon "threw up his hand." (Id. at 257.) Brooks did not mention that he had refused the Ta Chen pickup because his knee was hurting. (Id. at 346.)
After that, Brooks asked to speak to a higher-level supervisor but was told that it was no use and that the supervisor would not arrive at work until 8:00 am, so Brooks left. (S. Brooks Dep. at 257, 346-47.) In Brooks's personnel file, the reason for his termination was "refusal of dispatch." [Doc. 60-9.] The explanation was:
Driver was notified that he needed to do a pickup at Ta Chen and driver refused saying he did not want to go and left. [D]river had hours to do job [and] it is on his normal route. Driver stated he did not care if he was fired or suspended because he wasn't going.
[Id.]
Brooks [*13]  denied that he said those things. (S. Brooks Dep. at 258-59.) Before Brooks was fired, Phoenix Metals had not terminated an employee for violating the forced dispatch policy. (Dyon Dep. at 52.)

E. Todd Brooks's employment with Phoenix Metals
Brooks's son, Todd Brooks, also was an employee driver for Phoenix Metals until December 2014, although he was fired and rehired several times while employed there, and he later worked as a contractor for Phoenix Metals. (T. Brooks Dep. at 10-11, 81-82, 108-11, 113-14.) When Phoenix Metals had drivers log their hours manually, Todd Brooks usually began logging his hours between 4:00 am and 5:00 am to avoid the 14-hour requirement, and when drivers began using PeopleNet, he was instructed not to log in until he was ready to leave for the day. (Id. at 94-97, 100-02.) Todd Brooks usually logged into PeopletNet about 45 to 90 minutes after starting work. (Id. at 105.)
On one occasion, Todd Brooks reported to work at 3:30 or 3:45 am. (T. Brooks Dep. at 49.) At 6:30 pm, after making more than 20 stops, he returned to the Phoenix Metals facility in Norcross. (Id. at 49-50.) Dispatch told him to go to Ta Chen, and he refused. (Id. at 49-52.) Todd Brooks testified that transportation manager Dyon was "mad" and [*14]  gave him a different route for a few weeks but did not fire him. (Id. at 52.)

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On October 12, 2015, Brooks filed a complaint alleging that Phoenix Metals and its parent company, Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. ("Reliance Steel"), interfered with his rights under the FMLA and retaliated against him for taking leave under the FMLA. [Doc. 1.] On November 6, 2015, Defendants answered the complaint, and on March 16, 2016, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of Reliance Steel as a defendant in this action. [Docs. 5, 19.]
On May 18, 2016, Brooks filed another complaint, docketed as civil action number 1:16-cv-1602-ODE, alleging that Phoenix Metals discriminated and retaliated against him in violation of the ADA. [ECF No. 1:16-cv-1602-ODE, Doc. 1.] After Phoenix Metals answered the complaint, the Court consolidated the FMLA and ADA cases. [ECF No. 1:16-cv-1602-ODE, Docs. 5, 7.] The ADA complaint and answer were docketed in the instant action. [Docs. 40, 41.]
On September 12, 2016, Brooks filed moved for sanctions and attorney's fees in connection with the alleged spoliation of evidence in this case. [Doc. 55.] Phoenix Metals has responded to the motion [Doc. 56], and Brooks has [*15]  filed a reply [Doc. 62].
On October 3, 2016, Phoenix Metals filed its motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 60.] Brooks has responded to the motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 67], and Phoenix Metals filed a reply [Doc. 69].
On May 11, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on the pending motions.

III. DISCUSSION

A. Motion for sanctions
In his motion for sanctions, Brooks argues that Phoenix Metals spoliated evidence when it failed to preserve PeopleNet records for its truck drivers on May 21, 2015. Brooks chiefly argues that he has been prejudiced by the loss of those records because he cannot show that other drivers were available to make the Ta Chen pickup, and, thus, dispatch assigned the Ta Chen pickup to him as part of a "setup" to drive him to violate the forced dispatch policy. For the following reasons, the Court concludes that Brooks is not entitled to spoliation sanctions.

1. Background
On August 27, 2015, through counsel, Brooks sent a document retention letter to Reliance Steel's counsel at its headquarters in California. [Doc. 55-2.] Brooks requested that Reliance Steel and Phoenix Metals retain all documents and electronically stored information relevant to his FMLA and ADA claims. [*16]  [Id. at 1-2.] In the letter, he explained that he believed other drivers were available to make the Ta Chen pickup on May 21. [Id. at 3.] Moreover, at the time, Brooks's position was that he told the dispatcher that "another driver would have to be found" to make the Ta Chen pickup. [Id. at 3.] Brooks also specifically requested PeopleNet "information for Mr. Brooks . . . for the three months preceding his termination." [Id. at 5 n.1]
It appears that, on the date of Brooks's termination, Phoenix Metals immediately preserved Brooks's May 21 PeopleNet records by printing them. [Doc. 60-17.] In September 2015, Phoenix Metals retrieved the PeopleNet records from May 21 for Stephens, who completed the afternoon Ta Chen run on May 21 after Brooks refused. [Doc. 55 at 12-13; Doc. 55-5.]
PeopleNet records were maintained by PeopleNet in its network operating center in Minnesota [Doc. 54-4], but Phoenix Metals' dispatchers and supervisors had access to those records on-site through a web or phone application, (Dyon Dep. at 13-14, 37; Murphy Decl. ¶ 7). PeopleNet retained Phoenix Metals' driver records for the current month and the preceding six-months. (Dyon Dep. at 37-38.) After six months, the records were deleted as a matter of [*17]  routine data maintenance. [See Doc. 54-4; Doc. 56 at 3.] The PeopleNet records for May 21, 2015, were deleted on or soon after November 30, 2015. [Doc. 62 at 5; see Doc. 61-3 at 37-38.]
Discovery in this case began on December 7, 2015, 30 days after the answer [Doc. 5] was filed on November 6, 2015. See L.R. 26.2(A), NDGa. On December 8, 2015, Brooks began propounding discovery requests, in which he sought documents related to scheduling truck drivers, assignments made to truck drivers, and "all documentation regarding Defendant's hours of driving, work and off time during May 2015." [Doc. 56-1.] In a second request for production, served on April 14, 2016, Brooks specifically requested PeopleNet records for Phoenix Metals' drivers on May 21 and several other days. [Doc. 56-2.]

2. The parties' arguments
In his motion for sanctions, Brooks argues that he is entitled to sanctions, under either general spoliation standards or the recently amended Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(e), because Phoenix Metals failed to preserve the PeopleNet records for all drivers on May 21, 2015. [Doc. 55 at 1-2.] He argues that Phoenix Metals was on notice to preserve those documents because he sent a pre-litigation letter to Phoenix Metals' parent company [*18]  and asked for PeopleNet records and driving records to be preserved, Phoenix Metals knew that litigation was forthcoming by at least August 2015 and that Brooks believed the availability of other drivers to take the Ta Chen assignment on May 21 was relevant, and, in September 2015, Phoenix Metals took some steps to preserve some, but not all, PeopleNet records for May 21.6 [Id. at 8-16, 20-21.] He argues that he has been prejudiced by the loss of the PeopleNet records because they would have corroborated his argument that Phoenix Metals engaged in a "set up" to make him do more stops than other drivers, even though other drivers could have taken the Ta Chen assignment. [Id. at 2-8, 16-18.] Brooks also argues that Phoenix Metals' conduct constitutes an "intent to deprive" because it knew that it should have preserved the PeopleNet records but failed to do so. [Id. at 21-23.]
As a sanction, Brooks requests a presumption that the records of driver work hours for May 21, 2015, would have been favorable to Brooks, in that they would have shown that other drivers were available to make the Ta Chen pickup. [Doc. 55 at 2, 18-19.] He further requests that Phoenix Metals be prohibited, at trial, from introducing testimony that would contradict [*19]  the presumed content of the PeopleNet documents and that the jury be instructed as to the presumption of the contents of those documents. [Id.] He also requests attorney fees, pursuant to Rule 37(a)(5)(A) and the Court's inherent power to sanction a party based on inappropriate conduct. [Id. at 23.]
In response, Phoenix Metals chiefly argues that Brooks's motion for sanctions should be denied because Brooks cannot show that it failed to preserve the relevant PeopleNet documents, or that he was prejudiced by not having the PeopleNet records for other drivers, because the availability of other drivers to take the Ta Chen assignment is ultimately immaterial to the issue of whether he was fired for insubordination. [Doc. 56 at 4-5, 13-17.] Phoenix Metals suggests that Brooks could have taken the drivers' depositions, rather than demanding sanctions for the loss of the PeopleNet records. [Id. at 13.] It further argues that Brooks has pointed to no evidence that it acted in bad faith, particularly where the PeopleNet records were maintained by a third-party vendor and automatically deleted after six months. [Id. at 18-19.] As to the question of whether it had a duty to preserve PeopleNet records, Phoenix Metals points out that Brooks [*20]  sent his pre-litigation letter to Reliance Steel, not Phoenix Metals, and he did not specifically request the retention of PeopleNet records for all drivers on May 21 in his letter. [Id. at 5-7.] Brooks did not request the PeopleNet records for the other drivers until April 2016, when he sent his second request for production. [Id. at 2-3.] Phoenix Metals requests attorney fees incurred in opposing the motion for sanctions, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(B). [Id. at 20.]
In his reply, Brooks argues that Reliance Steel and Phoenix Metals employed the same corporate counsel at the early stages of this litigation, and, thus, Phoenix Metals' argument that it did not receive the pre-litigation letter is "nothing but a shell game." [Doc. 62 at 1-5.] He reiterates his arguments that Phoenix Metals had notice to preserve the PeopleNet documents and failed to do so, and the loss of the PeopleNet documents prejudiced his case. [Id. at 5-14.]

3. Legal standards
"Spoliation is the destruction or significant alteration of evidence, or the failure to preserve property for another's use as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation." In re Delta/AirTran Baggage Fee Antitrust Litigation, 770 F. Supp. 2d 1299, 1305 (N.D. Ga. 2011) (quotation omitted). Spoliation sanctions are available to a plaintiff where (1) the missing evidence existed at [*21]  one time, (2) the defendant had a duty to preserve the evidence, and (3) the evidence was crucial to the plaintiff's case. Id. In addition, in deciding whether to award spoliation sanctions, courts should look to factors including (1) prejudice to the non-spoiling party as a result of the destruction of evidence, (2) whether the prejudice can be cured, (3) the practical importance of the evidence, (4) whether the spoiling party acted in good or bad faith, and (5) the potential abuse of expert testimony about evidence not excluded. Connor v. Sun Trust Bank, 546 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1375-76 (N.D. Ga. 2008) (citing Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp., 427 F.3d 939, 945 (11th Cir. 2005)).
Effective December 1, 2015, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(e) was amended to provide specific measures for courts to apply when remedying the spoliation of electronically stored information. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e); see also id. advisory committee note to 2015 amendment. Rule 37(e) provides:
If electronically stored information that should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court:
(1) upon finding prejudice to another party from loss of the information, may order measures no greater than necessary to cure the prejudice; or
(2) only upon finding [*22]  that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information's use in litigation may:
(A) presume that the lost information was unfavorable to the party;
(B) instruct the jury that it may or must presume the information was unfavorable to the party; or
(C) dismiss the action or enter a default judgment.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e).
The amended Rule 37(e) applies to civil cases commenced after December 1, 2015, and "insofar as just and practicable, all proceedings then pending." Marshall v. Dentfirst, P.C., 313 F.R.D. 691, 695 (N.D. Ga. 2016) (quoting U.S. Supreme Court Order, dated Apr. 29, 2015, amending Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 2015 U.S. Order 0017). Under the amended Rule, a party seeking sanctions under Rule 37(e)(2) need not show prejudice resulting from the loss of electronically stored information as long as he can show "intent to deprive" or bad faith on the part of the other party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) advisory committee note to 2015 amendment; Virtual Studios, Inc. v. Stanton Carpet Corp., 4:15-cv-70-HLM, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195196, 2016 WL 5339601, at *10-11 (N.D. Ga. June 23, 2016).

4. Brooks has not been prejudiced by the loss of PeopleNet records.
Here, the Court concludes that Brooks is not entitled to spoliation sanctions, either under the broad spoliation standard in Delta/Airtran and Connor or the standard for electronically stored information in Rule 37(e)(1), because he cannot show that he was prejudiced [*23]  by the loss of the PeopleNet documents. As explained below regarding the motion for summary judgment, the availability of other drivers to make the Ta Chen pickup is immaterial to Brooks's claims of interference, discrimination, and retaliation, because he never asked Phoenix Metals to assign the Ta Chen pickup to another driver. Furthermore, Phoenix Metals has now conceded that other drivers were available and could have made the Ta Chen trip on May 21, 2015. The record also clearly shows that Stephens was able to make the Ta Chen pickup, even though his PeopleNet records show that he was close to exceeding his DOT-allowed hours when he finished. Thus, Brooks cannot show any prejudice, and he is not entitled to spoliation sanctions. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(1); Connor, 546 F. Supp. 2d at 1375-76.

5. Brooks has not shown that Phoenix Metals acted with "intent to deprive" or bad faith.
As noted above, the amended Rule 37(e) took effect on December 1, 2015, one day after the PeopleNet documents from May 21, 2015 were scheduled to be deleted. Under the circumstances, the Court does not find that it is appropriate to apply the measures in Rule 37(e)(2)—which allow courts to impose spoliation sanctions where the party who failed to preserve or deleted evidence acted [*24]  in bad faith, even without a separate showing of prejudice—where the Rule was not in effect at the time the records were deleted.
Even if Rule 37(e)(2) applies here, Brooks has not shown that Phoenix Metals acted with intent to deprive or bad faith when it failed to preserve the PeopleNet documents. The PeopleNet documents were deleted by a third-party vendor as a matter of routine maintenance. See Bashir v. Amtrak, 119 F.3d 929, 931 (11th Cir. 1997) (mere negligence in failing to preserve evidence does not show bad faith). Phoenix Metals took no affirmative act to cause the PeopleNet records to be lost. See Managed Care Sols. Inc. v. Essent Healthcare, Inc., 736 F. Supp. 2d 1317, 1323 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (a showing of bad faith based on circumstantial evidence requires that party who lost evidence engaged in an affirmative act causing evidence to be lost). Further, in view of the fact that those documents are immaterial to Brooks's FMLA and ADA claims, as explained below regarding the motion for summary judgment, the Court is reluctant to infer that Phoenix Metals failed to preserve the documents to keep them from being used as evidence in this action.
In sum, because there was no prejudice to Brooks, and the Court does not find that Phoenix Metals acted with intent to deprive Brooks of the documents or otherwise acted in bad faith, the motion [*25]  for sanctions and attorney fees is DENIED. Phoenix Metals' request for attorney fees is also DENIED because the Court does not condone its failure to use best practices regarding the preservation of electronically stored information, and it would be unjust to reward such conduct with a grant of attorney fees.

B. Motion for summary judgment
In its motion for summary judgment, Phoenix Metals chiefly argues that it terminated Brooks's employment because he violated the forced dispatch rule, and the record evidence does not show that that reason is untrue, or that it was related to Brooks's upcoming FMLA leave or was pretext for unlawful discrimination under the FMLA or the ADA. [Doc. 60-1 at 10-24.] In his response, Brooks argues that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment because he can show that there was a causal relationship between his scheduled FMLA leave and termination, and that Phoenix Metals' invocation of the forced dispatch policy was mere pretext for discrimination and retaliation under the ADA and the FMLA. [Doc. 67 at 6-25.] Phoenix Metals has filed a reply. [Doc. 69.]

1. The summary judgment standard
A court should grant summary judgment when there are no [*26]  genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears the initial burden of showing that it is entitled to summary judgment. Id. ("The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) ("Of course, a party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact."); Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991) (holding that Celotex did not change the rule that the movant bore the initial burden, and stating, "Even after Celotex it is never enough simply to state that the non-moving party cannot meet its burden at trial"). The movant may carry its burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325.
"Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark, 929 F.2d at 608. The nonmovant is then required [*27]  "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, answers to interrogatories, depositions, admissions and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (quotation omitted); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "[M]ere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion." Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005). Resolving all doubts in favor of the nonmoving party, the court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). In evaluating a summary judgment motion, "[t]he evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [the non-movant's] favor. Id. at 255.

2. FMLA Interference
Brooks's first claim is that he was entitled to take FMLA leave for his knee surgery, but Phoenix Metals interfered with his FMLA leave by terminating him. [Doc. 67 at 6-7.]
Under the FMLA, an eligible employee is entitled to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period because of, inter alia, a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his position. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). A person who takes leave under the FMLA is entitled [*28]  to restoration his position of employment after taking FMLA leave or restoration to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. Id. § 2614(a)(1). Moreover, an employee has the right to commence FMLA leave. Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir. 2010). A claim of FMLA interference does not require a showing that the employer had any motive or discriminatory intent in interfering with its employee's FMLA rights. Id. at 1235; see also Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1208 (11th Cir. 2001).
To prevail on a claim of FMLA interference, an employee must show, by preponderance of the evidence, that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled under the FMLA. Martin v. Brevard Cty. Pub. Schs., 543 F.3d 1261, 1266-67 (11th Cir. 2008). The employer is not liable for interference with the right to commence FMLA leave, however, if it shows that the employee dismissed before taking leave would have been dismissed regardless of any request for leave, meaning that the dismissal was "wholly unrelated" to the FMLA leave. Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1236; Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208. A court must determine whether the FMLA leave (or upcoming FMLA leave) was the proximate cause of the employee's discharge. Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236, 1242 (11th Cir. 2010).
Here, Brooks can make out a prima facie case of FMLA interference because he was prevented from exercising his right to commence his FMLA leave.7 Although Phoenix Metals approved [*29]  his FMLA leave, he was discharged before he could begin his scheduled leave. As explained below, however, the undisputed evidence also shows that Brooks would have been fired even if he had not made a request for FMLA leave. Thus, the evidence establishes as a matter of law that Brooks's termination was for reasons wholly unrelated to his requested leave, and Phoenix Metals cannot be held liable for FMLA interference.
Phoenix Metals has offered evidence that it fired Brooks because he violated the forced dispatch policy when he refused the Ta Chen pickup at the end of the day on May 21, 2015. It is undisputed that this is the reason that Phoenix Metals gave Brooks when he was fired, and it is the reason that Phoenix Metals recorded in Brooks's personnel file.
Brooks offers several arguments as to why that reason is untrue or why his termination was nevertheless related to his upcoming FMLA leave, but those arguments are either without merit or are not supported by the evidence taken in the light most favorite to him.

a. "Setup" theory
First, Brooks argues that his supervisors were "less than pleased" that he would be taking FMLA leave for his knee pain and that they engaged in a [*30]  "setup" to assign him more work and less desirable work than other drivers. [Doc. 67 at 8, 11-13.] There is no objective evidence in the record, however, that suggests that Brooks's supervisors were "less than pleased" about his FMLA leave. Brooks was an in-town, day shift driver and his route had more frequent deliveries with less time between stops. (See S. Brooks Dep. at 64-65; Dyon Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.) Even though he had more stops to make on May 21 than usual, he was able to make those stops between about 5:15 am and 5:15 pm. [Doc. 60-17]; (S. Brooks Dep. at 63). Further, Phoenix Metals' dispatchers rotated the assignment of the Ta Chen afternoon pickup among the drivers "to promote fairness." (Dyon Decl. ¶ 11.) Brooks also went to Ta Chen only 7 out of 42 total possible trips in May 2015, after he was approved for FMLA leave, and therefore he had to do the Ta Chen afternoon pickup less than half the time. [Doc. 67-7.] Other drivers had similar Ta Chen assignments in May 2015 before Brooks was fired. A driver named Billy, a driver named Leonard, and a driver named Patrick each took the Ta Chen afternoon pickup at least twice, and a driver named Garith took the afternoon pickup at [*31]  least three times. [Id.] Thus, the record evidence does not support Brooks's speculative assertion that there was a "setup" to give him less favorable assignments to drive him to violate the forced dispatch policy.

b. Cat's paw theory
Brooks also argues that this is a "cat's paw" case because one of the dispatchers, Murphy, knew about his knee pain and upcoming FMLA leave, and lied to Dyon about Brooks's reason for refusing the Ta Chen run when he stated that Brooks refused the pickup because he wanted to go buy a cell phone. [Doc. 67 at 9-10.] He argues that Murphy knew about Brooks's upcoming FMLA leave and knee pain and had reason to harbor animus toward Brooks. [Id. at 10.] He contends that Murphy lied to Dyon about why Brooks did not want to make the Ta Chen pickup so that Dyon would fire Brooks. [Id.]
The cat's paw theory is unavailing here because there is no record evidence indicating that Murphy was biased against Brooks based on his planned FMLA leave or knee pain. At oral argument, Brooks suggested that Murphy's animus was evident by the way that he minimized his knowledge of Brooks's knee condition, but Murphy's declaration did not downplay Brooks's condition. Murphy recalled that [*32]  Brooks complained about his knee, and both Murphy and Brooks recalled an incident in which Murphy allowed Brooks to go home early because his knee hurt. (S. Brooks Dep. at 120; Murphy Decl. ¶¶ 21.)
Further, Dyon personally investigated the forced dispatch incident and made an independent decision to fire Brooks. See Pennington v. City of Huntsville, 261 F.3d 1262, 1270 (11th Cir. 2001) ("Where a decisionmaker conducts his own evaluation and makes an independent decision, his decision is free of the taint of a biased subordinate employee."). Dyon and Gibson spoke with Brooks on May 22 to discuss his violation of the forced dispatch policy and to learn Brooks's "side of the story." (DSUMF ¶ 89; Dyon Decl. ¶ 15; Gibson Decl. ¶ 13.) Brooks told Dyon that he ran out of DOT-allowed hours, but Dyon rejected that excuse. (S. Brooks Dep. at 181-82.) Dyon's rejection of that excuse was consistent with the fact that Brooks had enough DOT hours, according to Phoenix Metals' policy on how drivers counted their DOT hours. Moreover, Brooks did not tell Dyon that he did not make the Ta Chen pickup because he was in pain. (Id. at 346.)
Because there is no objective evidence of animus, and Dyon spoke with Brooks and conducted his own investigation, even if Brooks disputes the outcome [*33]  of that investigation, there is no indication that Murphy used Dyon as a "cat's paw" to have Brooks fired to interfere with his FMLA leave or otherwise discriminate against him.

c. Close proximity between approval of FMLA request and termination
Brooks argues that the close proximity between the approval of his FMLA request and his termination suggests that the two are causally connected. [Doc. 67 at 11.] While close temporal proximity can establish an issue of fact as to causation, Brooks's insubordination in violating the forced dispatch policy severed any causal connection between Brooks's FMLA request and the approval of his request and his termination. See O'Connor v. PCA Family Health Plan, Inc., 200 F.3d 1349, 1354 (11th Cir. 2000) (employer's selection of employee for layoffs while she was on FMLA leave was not interference).

d. The availability of other drivers
Brooks also argues that other drivers were available to take the Ta Chen delivery on May 21, when he refused the Ta Chen pickup. [Doc. 67 at 14-16.] But the relevant question is whether Brooks was insubordinate in refusing the Ta Chen pickup, not whether other employees might have been selected for the pickup. Brooks also never asked to have another driver assigned to the stop, even though Dyon had [*34]  accommodated such requests, at least on some occasions, in the past. (Dyon Dep. at 65-66.)

e. Knee pain
He further notes that he was suffering from knee-related pain when he refused the Ta Chen pickup. [Doc. 67 at 10.] Regarding his knee pain, Brooks only told his supervisors, "I'm hurting." (S. Brooks Dep. at 70, 176.) He did not request to have the pickup assigned to another driver or ask for sick leave because he was in pain.
Brooks also argues that he behaved insubordinately by refusing an assignment from dispatch in the past, but he was not punished for doing so until he scheduled his FMLA leave. [Doc. 67 at 19.] Assuming those instances both happened after he requested FMLA leave, on both of those occasions, he was told that he could go home because he was in pain. (S. Brooks Dep. at 92-93, 120, 367-68; Murphy Decl. ¶ 21.) On May 21, however, he did not receive, wait for, or even ask for permission to leave work early without completing his assigned stops. Instead, he refused to make the Ta Chen pickup and left work without speaking to anyone.

f. DOT-allowed hours
Throughout this case, Brooks's position has been that he had nearly exhausted his DOT-allowed hours before the Ta Chen [*35]  delivery, or would have been close to exhausting his hours if he had completed the Ta Chen delivery. [See Doc. 67 at 10, 14, 17.] According to Brooks's PeopleNet records for May 21, he logged in at 5:15 am and had been on duty for twelve hours and four minutes when he stopped working for the day. [Doc. 60-17.] He had nearly two hours of remaining on-duty time in which he could have completed the Ta Chen pickup. Brooks could have expected the Ta Chen run to take about ninety minutes or more roundtrip, although Stephens actually performed the pickup that day did so in an hour. [Doc. 60-25]; (Dyon Decl. ¶ 6; S. Brooks Dep. at 168-70). Thus, Brooks had enough on-duty hours remaining that he would not have run afoul of DOT regulations by completing the Ta Chen pickup. When he complained that he had driven too many hours that day, from his supervisors' perspective, he had sufficient time to complete the Ta Chen run.
Brooks asserts that Phoenix Metals had its drivers under-report their on-duty hours when they begin using the PeopleNet system. [Doc. 67 at 13-14.] Supervisors told the drivers not to log in to PeopleNet until they were ready to drive, for the purpose of evading the DOT regulations [*36]  on hours.8 [Id.] On May 21, he asserts, he actually had been on duty for an hour longer than his log-in time indicated, and he could not have legally completed the Ta Chen pickup. [See id. at 16.]
But whether Phoenix Metals had its drivers manipulate their on-duty hours in this manner, or whether Brooks was opposing an unlawful transportation practice in refusing to make the Ta Chen pickup, is immaterial. The undisputed evidence shows that, when PeopleNet was installed in one of its trucks, Phoenix Metals counted the driver's hours based on his or her PeopleNet records. (Dyon Dep. at 12-13; S. Brooks Dep. at 161-63.) Moreover, the dispatch operators used the PeopleNet records to determine whether drivers had enough hours remaining to complete trips toward the end of the work day. (Hellstein Dep. at 51; Dyon Dep. at 12-14; Murphy Decl. ¶ 7.) Nothing in the record suggests that Phoenix Metals used any other method for determining whether a driver had enough hours to accept a dispatch assignment.9 For purposes of determining whether Phoenix Metals interfered with Brooks's FMLA leave, it does not matter whether Phoenix Metals was engaged in an unlawful practice with respect to recording its drivers' [*37]  hours. See Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1266 (11th Cir. 2010) (stating, in the employment discrimination context, "We do not sit as a 'super-personnel department,' and it is not our role to second-guess the wisdom of an employer's business decisions—indeed the wisdom of them is irrelevant—as long as those decisions are not made with a discriminatory motive."); id. at 1266-67 (citing with approval Wallace v. SMC Pneumatics, Inc., 103 F.3d 1394, 1399 (7th Cir. 1997), in which the court listed non-actionable reasons that a plaintiff might be fired, such as his status as a whistleblower or based on an invidious factor, but not the factor outlawed by the statute under which the plaintiff is suing)).
Brooks also briefly argues that forced dispatch is an illegal practice but provides no legal citation for that argument. (PSMF ¶ 13.) In a final rule issued in November 2015, after Brooks was fired, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration clarified that a motor carrier cannot coerce its drivers to operate in violation of the hours-of-service rules. Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers, 80 Fed. Reg. 74965 (Nov. 30, 2015) (codified in relevant part at 49 C.F.R. §§ 390.5 to .6). That does not mean, however, that a forced dispatch policy with an exception for drivers who are close to their hours-of-service limit is illegal or was facially illegal in this case.

g. Todd Brooks's previous insubordination
Brooks asserts [*38]  that his son, Todd Brooks, had violated the forced dispatch policy but was not fired. [Doc. 67 at 18-19.] Furthermore, no one had been fired for violating the forced dispatch policy until Brooks, and in the past, Dyon had accommodated drivers' requests to have their routes changed or to have another driver cover a delivery or pickup. [Id. at 18.]
First, the fact that Dyon had accommodated drivers' requests to change their schedules is immaterial because Brooks did not make such a request here. Brooks simply refused the Ta Chen pickup and walked off the job site.
The fact that Phoenix Metals had not previously fired anyone pursuant to the forced dispatch policy is also immaterial unless other drivers actually violated the forced dispatch policy. Brooks has not shown, however, that any other driver, including Todd Brooks, violated the forced dispatch policy.10 Todd Brooks claimed that he refused a dispatch after a long day when he reported to work, at the latest, at 3:45 am. (T. Brooks Dep. at 49.) His practice, so that he did not run out of hours, was to begin recording his hours after 45 to 90 minutes, when he was close to taking his first trip of the day. (Id. at 105.) Assuming that Todd Brooks did not [*39]  begin recording his hours until 5:15 am, he had been on duty for 13 hours and 15 minutes when, at 6:15 pm, he was told to go to Ta Chen. (Id. at 49-52.) Because the Ta Chen run took between an hour and 90 minutes, he could not have completed the trip with his remaining 45 minutes of on-duty time, even based on his under-reported hours. Thus, Todd Brooks would have been within the exception to the forced dispatch policy for drivers who would exceed their DOT-allowed hours when he refused the Ta Chen assignment. (See Gibson Decl. ¶ 15.)

h. Discrepancies in the testimony
Brooks also argues that he can show pretext based on discrepancies between his own evidence and the testimony presented by Phoenix Metals' supervisors and dispatch employees, which, he argues, create a material issue of fact. [Doc. 67 at 16-17.] He identifies discrepancies in the testimony about the timing and circumstances of the Ta Chen dispatch assignment, because Phoenix Metals' dispatchers testified that they told Brooks to take the Ta Chen pickup at about 4:00 pm, but Brooks testified that he received the Ta Chen assignment at about 3:20 pm. [Id. at 17.] Brooks and Phoenix Metals' witnesses also provided different testimony about [*40]  the reason that Brooks gave for refusing the Ta Chen pickup. [Id.]
The parties' disagreement over the exact timing and circumstances of the dispatch assignment and whether Brooks spoke to anyone afterward is immaterial, however. There is no dispute that Brooks refused the Ta Chen pickup and his purported violation of the forced dispatch policy was Phoenix Metals' stated reason for discharging him. These discrepancies do not bear on the question of whether Brooks violated Phoenix Metals' forced dispatch policy and had enough hours to make the Ta Chen pickup based on his PeopleNet log. In confronting such immaterial discrepancies in the facts at summary judgment, the Court takes the plaintiff's evidence as true and disregards the defendant's contrary evidence, but the Court does not infer that the defendant's witnesses are not credible so as to create an issue of fact.
In sum, Phoenix Metals has shown that Brooks's firing was "wholly unrelated" to his FMLA leave. See Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1236; Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208. Brooks's arguments that Phoenix Metals' reason for firing him was untrue are not supported by the record and otherwise without merit. Accordingly, Phoenix Metals is entitled to summary judgment on his FMLA interference [*41]  claim.

3. FMLA Retaliation
Brooks's next claim is that Phoenix Metals retaliated against him for requesting leave under the FMLA for his knee surgery. [Doc. 67 at 20-22.]
The FMLA provides that it is "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter of the FMLA." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). It further provides, that it is "unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter." Id. § 2615(a)(2). The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that, even though the FMLA does not explicitly prohibit retaliation, "the substance of the FMLA provisions . . . is that an employer may not do bad things to an employee who has exercised or attempted to exercise any rights under the statute," including termination for asking for medical leave. Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 n.5 (11th Cir. 2000).
In evaluating an FMLA retaliation claim, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, courts use the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Smith v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 273 F.3d 1303, 1314 (11th Cir. 2001); Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798. A prima facie case of retaliation requires a showing that the employee engaged in statutorily protected conduct, the employee suffered an adverse employment [*42]  action, and there is a causal connection between the two. Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1234. A plaintiff can show a causal connection by showing that the decision maker was aware of the protected conduct and that the protected activity and adverse employment action were close in time. Id. at 1235; Brungart, 231 F.3d at 799.
If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Smith, 273 F.3d at 1314. If the defendant does so, the plaintiff must show that the proffered reason is pretextual. Id. A plaintiff shows pretext by showing "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in [defendant's] proffered legitimate reasons for its actions that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp., Inc., 509 F.3d 1344, 1348 (11th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted); King v. Ferguson Enters., Inc., 971 F. Supp. 2d 1200, 1218 (N.D. Ga. 2013), aff'd 568 F. App'x 686 (11th Cir. 2014).
Brooks has shown that he engaged in statutorily protected conduct by requesting FMLA leave for his knee surgery and that he suffered an adverse employment action when he was fired. See Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798 n.5. For purposes of establishing a prima facie case at summary judgment, the approximately one-month gap between Brooks's request for FMLA leave and his firing is sufficient to establish a causal [*43]  connection. See Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding, for purposes of an ADA retaliation claim, that a seven-week gap between a plaintiff's protected expression and his termination was sufficient to show causation). Thus, the Court concludes that Brooks has established a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation.
The burden therefore shifts to Phoenix Metals to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Brooks's termination, and it has done so here. Namely, Phoenix Metals asserts that it fired Brooks for violating the forced dispatch policy. Under the McDonnell-Douglas framework, the burden shifts back to Brooks to show that the proffered reason was mere pretext for discrimination. To that end, Brooks points to nothing in the record, other than his own speculation that his employers were "less than pleased" that he was taking FMLA leave, suggesting that Phoenix Metals' decisionmakers and other key employees had any discriminatory intent. The fact that Phoenix Metals approved his FMLA leave also strongly suggests that Phoenix Metals had no discriminatory intent with respect to Brooks's request for FMLA leave.
Furthermore, as discussed above with respect to his FMLA interference claim, Brooks points to nothing [*44]  in the record evidence that casts doubt on Phoenix Metals' proffered reason for firing him. Thus, he has not shown that there are "weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions" in Phoenix Metals' assertion that it fired Brooks for violating the forced dispatch policy, and Brooks has not met his burden to show pretext. See Springer, 509 F.3d at 1348. Accordingly, Phoenix Metals is entitled to summary judgment on his FMLA retaliation claim.

4. ADA Discrimination and Retaliation
Brooks's ADA complaint alleges that he suffered discriminatory and retaliatory conduct under the ADA by terminating him. [Doc. 40.] In his response to the motion for summary judgment, Brooks argues that he was denied a reasonable accommodation for his knee pain because, after he told the dispatcher that he was "hurting," the dispatcher did not assign another driver to go to Ta Chen, relieve him of other stops that same day so that he could go to Ta Chen earlier, or relieve him of the rest of his route. [Doc. 67 at 22-25.] At oral argument, he argued that he was also asserting a claim of discriminatory discharge or retaliation for engaging in protected activity under the ADA, although those claims do not [*45]  appear in his response to the motion for summary judgment.

a. Discriminatory discharge and retaliation
For starters, it appears that Brooks abandoned his claims of discriminatory discharge and ADA retaliation by not addressing them until oral argument. But even assuming, arguendo, that Brooks could establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA based on a theory of discriminatory discharge, or discharge in retaliation for requesting an accommodation, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, the Court evaluates such claims under the burden shifting McDonnell-Douglas framework. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004) (discriminatory discharge); Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998) (retaliation). Brooks's ADA claims related to his discharge fail for the same reason that his FMLA retaliatory discharge claims fail: he cannot rebut Phoenix Metals' legitimate reason for terminating him or otherwise show that that reason was pretext for discrimination. Accordingly, to the extent that they are not abandoned, Phoenix Metals is entitled to summary judgment on those claims.

b. Failure to accommodate
The ADA prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). To prevail on a disability discrimination claim, [*46]  the plaintiff must show that he is disabled, he was a "qualified individual" at the time he was discharged, and that he was discriminated against on the basis of his disability. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir.), cert. denied 137 S. Ct. 592, 196 L. Ed. 2d 474 (2016).
An employer must make "reasonable accommodations" to an otherwise qualified employee with a disability "unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the employer." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). The ADA regulations contemplate that an employer and employee may need to engage in an "interactive process" to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3).
An employee has a responsibility to inform his employer that he needs an accommodation for his disability. Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 1999). An employer's duty to provide an accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation is made. Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1255-56. Moreover, courts have held that an employer's duty to participate in the interactive process is not triggered unless the employee has made an adequate request for an accommodation, putting the employer on notice of the need for an accommodation. See E.E.O.C. v. C.R. England, Inc., 644 F.3d 1028, 1049 (10th Cir. 2011); Williams v. Clarke Cty. Dep't of Human Res., 834 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1320 (S.D. Ala. 2011).
Here, the Court cannot conclude that Brooks made an adequate request for an accommodation when he told the dispatch "I'm hurting" before he refused the Ta Chen assignment. Brooks's statement [*47]  that he was hurting was not accompanied by any request for a change in his route or a request for dispatch to assign the Ta Chen stop to another driver. Brooks also cites no authority suggesting that this was an adequate request. When dispatch or a supervisor did not tell Brooks that he could go home after he said, "I'm hurting," it was incumbent upon him to make a request for an accommodation for his knee pain rather than simply walking off the job site. See Gaston, 167 F.3d at 1364 (employee could not prevail on ADA claim where she commented that she could not perform job requirements and resigned without explanation).
In sum, Brooks has not demonstrated that he requested an accommodation for his knee pain, and Phoenix Metals is entitled to summary judgment on his ADA claim.11

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Brooks's motion for spoliation sanctions is DENIED and the parties' requests for attorneys fees are DENIED. [Doc. 55.] It is further RECOMMENDED that the motion for summary judgment be GRANTED. [Doc. 60.]
IT IS SO ORDERED AND RECOMMENDED this 22nd day of May, 2017.
