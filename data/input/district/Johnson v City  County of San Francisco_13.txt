ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Re: Dkt. No. 66
On June 29, 2015, Plaintiff Dolores Johnson filed this employment discrimination action against Defendant City and County of San Francisco. Before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
On December 15, 2016, the Court held a hearing, and, after careful consideration of the parties' arguments and moving papers, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.

I. BACKGROUND
Dolores Johnson began work at the Waste Water Enterprises ("WWE") Division of the City's Public Utilities Commission ("PUC") in September 2003. (Dep. of Delores Johnson, "Def.'s Johnson Dep.," Decl. of Kenneth M. Walczak, "Walczak Decl.," Dkt. No. 66-3, Ex. C at 26:1-8.) Johnson is 54 years old, and identifies as African-American, though her mother is of Japanese descent, and she identified her [*2]  race as both "Black (not of Hispanic origin)" and "Asian or Pacific Islander" when she applied for City employment in 1999. (Walczak Decl., Ex. F; Def.'s Johnson Dep., Ex. 37.)
For the majority of her employment with the PUC, Johnson has been a full-time, permanent 7372 Stationary Engineer, Sewage Plant. (Def.'s Johnson Dep. at 28:1-23; Decl. of Silvia Castellanos, "Castellanos Decl.," Dkt. No. 66-2 ¶ 4.) According to the City, a 7372 Stationary Engineer must be able to perform many physical tasks, including but not limited to these:
• Inspect and manually test heavy sewage plant machinery and equipment;
• Access difficult-to-reach gauges and meters;
• Perform manual tasks requiring the handling of equipment exposed to raw sewage;
• Collect and perform simple assessments of raw sewage and chemical samples on prescribed schedule at specific locations;
• Operate, inspect, maintain, overhaul and make major and minor repairs to wide variety of pumping, heating, ventilating, process machinery and equipment;
• Lubricate and grease machinery and equipment;
• Clean and maintain machinery, equipment and facilities;
• Inspect sewage pipe lines, tanks and gates to check for the condition of equipment, [*3]  for infiltration and blockage of debris and build-up of mineral deposits, etc., by draining tanks, by monitoring pressure and flow indicators and by visual inspection;
• Operate, inspect, and maintain solids treatment and flocculating chemical systems;
• Operate, inspect, and maintain disinfection and dechlorination systems by performing tests and analyzing samples; and
• Assist in training and in supervising work of apprentices by oral instruction and hands-on demonstration in the operation and maintenance of sewage treatment processes.
(Def.'s Johnson Dep., Ex. 34; Decl. of Michael C. Ho, "Ho Decl.," Dkt. No. 66-1, Exs. 1-G, 1-J, 1-S, 1-T, 1-U; Def.'s Dep. of Bernadette Larkin-Oliveira, "Def.'s Larkin-Oliveira Dep.," Walczak Decl., Ex. E. at 40:18-42:18.) Manual repairs are approximately 40% of the job. (See Ho Decl., Exs. 1-G, 1-J, 1-S, 1-T, 1-U.)
On August 5, 2008, Johnson became disabled when the weight of a heavy motor shifted on to her when another team member stumbled. (Def.'s Johnson Dep. at 52:22-55:3.) Plaintiff suffered "damaged disks" in her neck and back and injuries to her knee, shoulder, arms, and hands, which still cause her pain. Id. Since 2008, and especially after a [*4]  May 2012 transportation incident which allegedly caused new neck and back injuries, Plaintiff's medical providers have generally certified that she has work restrictions for which she cannot: lift weights greater than 25 pounds; repetitively bend; stoop or crawl; or lift weights greater than 15 pounds over her head. (Ho Decl. ¶ 23, Exs. 1-G, 1-J, 1-S, 1-T, 1-U, 1-V, 1-X; Castellanos Decl. ¶ 23; Def.'s Johnson Dep. at 54:1-55:3.) Plaintiff also alleges that she suffers from stress, anxiety, and depression, which "affect [her] ability to work, period." (Def.'s Johnson Dep. at 124:14-125:8.)
Johnson took workers' compensation leave related to her injuries at various times in 2008, 2009, and 2010. (Ho Decl. ¶ 23, Ex. 1 at 2.) On November 3, 2009, her workers' compensation doctor declared her injuries to be "permanent and stationary". (Ho Decl. ¶ 23.) On April 10, 2010, Johnson submitted a request for reasonable accommodation, in which she asked to return to work from leave but stated that she "would need reassignment without reclassification." (Ho Decl. ¶ 26, Ex. 1-B; Castellanos Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.)
After submitting that request, Johnson occupied various modified/alternative light-duty assignments [*5]  for limited periods of time. (See Ho Decl. Ex. 1 at 2-4, Exs. 1-D, 1-E, 1-F.) These interim assignments were made available both in an effort to return Plaintiff to work under the City's Workers' Compensation policies, and in response to her request for reasonable accommodation. (Ho Decl. ¶¶ 29-42.) During these interim assignments, Plaintiff's 7372 Stationary Engineer position at the PUC remained unfilled and available for her to reoccupy in the event a medical professional certified that she could perform the position's essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation. (Ho Decl. ¶ 14; Castellanos Decl. ¶ 6.)
From May 2010 through August 4, 2011, Johnson worked as a dispatcher for the PUC's Sewer Operations division. (Ho Decl. ¶¶ 29-31, Ex. 1-D.) From August 5, 2011 to September 13, 2013, she assisted the Reliability Centered Maintenance ("RCM") Team at the PUC's Southeast plant, performing field inspections, assessing equipment, and doing data entry. (Ho Decl. ¶¶ 32-33, Exs. 1-E, 1-F.) During a funding diversion for the RCM program, Johnson was temporarily reassigned to the Biofuel team, where she assisted with tasks pertaining to safety programs until March 19, 2014. [*6]  (Ho Decl. ¶ 37, Ex. 1 at 4, Ex. 1-H; Dep. of Mark Harris, "Def.'s Harris Dep.," Walczak Decl., Ex. D at 41:14-42:15.) She was then reassigned to the RCM team from March through September 2014, when the PUC disbanded the RCM program entirely. (Ho Decl. ¶¶ 39-40, Exh. 1-H.)
During her six months on the Biofuel team, Johnson feuded with team members Jodi Cravens and Lalonnie Palega. (Dep. of Jodi Cravens, "Def.'s Cravens Dep.," Walczak Decl., Ex. A at 38:8-9; Def.'s Johnson Dep. at 110:2-113:23, Ex. 45; Ho Decl. ¶ 38, Ex. 10.) She complained that some of her duties were transferred to Ms. Palega to perform. (Third Am. Compl., "TAC," Dkt. No. 46, Ex. 3 at 3.) Plaintiff also sought permission to attend computer training in Atlanta, Georgia. That request was denied by PUC Assistant General Manager Tommy Moala. (Dep. of Tommy Moala, "Def.'s Moala Dep.," Walczak Decl., Ex. B at 29:5-7, Ex. 27.)
On September 29, 2014, Johnson sought and received permission from the PUC to take a leave of absence from her Stationary Engineer position to temporarily fill a 7262 Maintenance Planner position at the Department of Public Works ("DPW"). (Ho Decl. ¶ 41, Ex. 1 at 4.) Moala approved one year of leave for [*7]  this purpose, which was renewable for additional time thereafter. (Def.'s Moala Dep. at 30:7-13, Ex. 28.)
Also in 2014, Plaintiff applied for a promotion to a permanent 7262 Maintenance Planner position. (Ho Decl. Exs. 2-5.) Plaintiff did not receive the promotion. Id. The City contends that she was not given the position, because numerous other applicants outscored her on the written examination and the in-person interview. Id. Christina Ting, an Asian-American woman a year older than Plaintiff, was selected for the position. Id. Ms. Ting received the highest score of all of the applicants interviewed. Id.
Plaintiff's assignment with DPW ended in March 2015. (Ho Decl. ¶ 42, Ex. 1-J.) Since that time, the City has conducted searches for an alternative position whose essential functions Plaintiff can perform, with or without reasonable accommodation. (Ho Decl. ¶¶ 42-48, 50-67; Ho Decl., Ex. 1 at 4-9, Exs. 1-J through 1-BB, Ex. 11; Castellanos Decl. ¶¶ 21-25, Exs. B, C, D.)
Plaintiff has declined opportunities throughout the PUC and Citywide. In 2015, Johnson refused to consider working as a Principal Water Services Clerk (1480), or a Unit Clerk (14268), both of which are clerical or administrative [*8]  positions requiring less strenuous physical activity. (Castellanos Decl. ¶ 27; Ho Decl. Ex. 1-L.) Plaintiff cited differences in salary, the lack of free parking, and commuting issues as justifications for her refusal. (Castellanos Decl. ¶ 27.) In 2016, Johnson refused to consider similar positions or to consider working as a Sr. Water Services Clerk (1478), citing her refusal to work in the same building as Moala. (Castellanos Decl. ¶ 28; Ho Decl. ¶¶ 45-46, Ex. 1-K; Johnson Decl. ¶ 124.) But the position would not have involved any direct contact between Johnson and Moala, as the building in question has 13 floors and houses over 900 employees. (Ho Decl. ¶ 46.)
Today, Plaintiff's Stationary Engineer position remains unfilled. According to the City, she could reclaim it if cleared to return to work by her doctor. (Ho Decl. ¶ 17.) Plaintiff has not been cleared, and she now questions whether she can do any work at all. (Johnson Dep. at 124:14-125:16.) Plaintiff concedes that she cannot perform all of the essential functions in the general position description. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 1.)
On April 18, 2016, Plaintiff filed her third amended complaint. The operative complaint contains thirteen [*9]  causes of action, including claims for race, sex, and age discrimination under state and federal law, disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act and state law, failure to provide reasonable accommodation, failure to engage in the interactive process, failure to prevent discrimination, and retaliation under federal and state law. Id.
On October 13, 2016, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. (Def.'s Mot., Dkt. No. 66.) On October 27, 2016, Plaintiff filed an opposition, in which she concedes that she is not pursuing the age and gender discrimination claims. (Pl.'s Opp'n, Dkt. No. 70 at 1.) On November 3, 2016, Defendant filed a reply. (Def.'s Reply, Dkt. No. 74.)

II. LEGAL STANDARD
A party may move for summary judgment on a "claim or defense" or "part of... a claim or defense." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is appropriate when, after adequate discovery, there is no genuine issue as to material facts and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.; see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Material facts are those that might affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute as to a material fact is "genuine" if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for [*10]  the nonmoving party. Id.
A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion, and of identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. Where the moving party will have the burden of proof at trial, it must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party. Southern Calif. Gas. Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir. 2003).
On an issue where the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial, it may discharge its burden of production by either (1) by "produc[ing] evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's case" or (2) after suitable discovery "show[ing] that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element of its claim or defense to discharge its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd., v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Celotex, 477 U.S. 324-25.
Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the opposing party must then set forth specific facts showing that there is some genuine issue for trial in order to defeat the motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250. "A party opposing summary judgment may not simply question the credibility of the movant to foreclose summary judgment. [*11]  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 254. "Instead, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and by its own evidence set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Far Out Prods., Inc. v. Oskar, 247 F.3d 986, 997 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations and quotations omitted). The non-moving party must produce "specific evidence, through affidavits or admissible discovery material, to show that the dispute exists." Bhan v. NMS Hosps., Inc., 929 F.2d 1404, 1409 (9th Cir. 1991). Conclusory or speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact to defeat summary judgment. Thornhill Publ'g Co., Inc. v. Gen. Tel. & Electronics Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).
In deciding a motion for summary judgment, a court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all justifiable inferences in its favor. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255; Hunt v. City of Los Angeles, 638 F.3d 703, 709 (9th Cir. 2011).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Motion for Summary Judgment
Plaintiff is only pursuing her discrimination claims based on race discrimination and disability discrimination. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 1.) She is no longer pursuing her claims based on age or gender discrimination. Id.1

i. Race Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff's first and second causes of action are for race discrimination under Title VII and California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA.") (TAC ¶¶ 18-24.) A disparate treatment claim must be supported by direct evidence of discrimination, [*12]  or may instead be evaluated under the burden-of-proof-and production analysis set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Because state and federal laws are similar, California courts look to federal precedent when interpreting FEHA. Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). In particular, courts use the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework and other federal employment law principles when analyzing disparate treatment claims under FEHA. See Schechner v. KPIX-TV, 686 F.3d 1018, 1023 (9th Cir. 2012); Earl v. Nielsen Media Res., Inc., 658 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 2011).
Plaintiff claims that Mark Harris's deposition testimony that PUC manager John Powell stated to Mr. Harris that he would "close RCM" constitutes direct evidence of race discrimination. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 14.) In reply, the City argues that the alleged statement is hearsay, because Mr. Powell has not testified in this case, and the statement is, therefore, inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(c) to prove any racial animus on the part of Mr. Powell himself. (Def.'s Reply at 9.) Even if it were admissible, a statement only constitutes direct evidence of discrimination when it is "made by individuals who had decision-making authority with regard to the plaintiff['s] employment." Strohn v. Assocs. Fin. Servs. Co., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14706, 2001 WL 1112112, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 18, 2001)(no foundation for opinion that manager had discriminatory intent). Indeed, Plaintiff does not provide any evidence to support that the statement Mr. Powell [*13]  allegedly made to Mr. Harris regarding "clos[ing] RCM" was based on racial animus. (See Def.'s Reply at 10.) Indeed, Mr. Harris testified only that Mr. Powell did not want Plaintiff to return to work at RCM." (Pl.'s Harris Dep. at 64:20-65:18.) Furthermore, Mr. Harris testified that Mr. Powell's allegedly racist conduct was directed at him and not Plaintiff, and that Mr. Powell actually thought highly of Plaintiff's work. (Dep. of Mark Harris, "Def.'s Harris Dep.," Reply Decl. of Kenneth M. Walczak, "Walczak Reply Decl.," Dkt. No. 74-2, Ex. 1 at 74:16-76:8.) General testimony characterized as "institutional racism" is not direct evidence of same. (See Pl.'s Opp'n at 3.) Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has presented no direct evidence of race discrimination.
Thus, Plaintiff can survive summary judgment on her discrimination claims only if she first provides sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. If she succeeds, the burden shifts to Defendant to produce evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. If Defendant successfully carries that burden, the ultimate burden shifts to Plaintiff to raise a triable issue of material [*14]  fact as to whether the proffered reasons for the adverse action are a mere pretext for unlawful discrimination. See Shelley v. Geren, 666 F.3d 599, 607-08 (9th Cir. 2012). Notwithstanding the burden-shifting, the ultimate burden of proof remains with Plaintiff to show that Defendant intentionally discriminated against her based on her race. Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271, 1281 (9th Cir. 2000).
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination through circumstantial evidence, Plaintiff must show that (1) she was a member of the protected class; (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) that at the time of the adverse action she was satisfactorily performing her job; and (4) that she was replaced in that position by a person outside the protected class who had equal or inferior qualifications, or was discharged under circumstances otherwise giving rise to an inference of discrimination. See Diaz v. Eagle Produce, Ltd. Partnership, 521 F.3d 1201, 1207 (9th Cir. 2008); see also Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); Pottenger v. Potlach Corp., 329 F.3d 740, 745-46 (9th Cir. 2003); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 354-55.
The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly noted that "[t]he burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous." See, e.g., Lyons v. England, 307 F.3d 1092, 1112 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). On summary judgment, the degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case "is minimal and does not even rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence." Schechner v. KPIX-TV, 686 F.3d 1018, 1025 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994)).
Here, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot [*15]  show that she suffered an adverse employment action. (Def.'s Mot. at 6-7.)
a. Whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action.
"Not every employment decision amounts to an adverse employment action." Strother v. S. California Permanente Med. Grp., 79 F.3d 859, 869 (9th Cir. 1996), as amended on denial of reh'g (Apr. 22, 1996), as amended on denial of reh'g (June 3, 1996).
Among those employment decisions that can constitute an adverse employment action are termination, dissemination of a negative employment reference, issuance of an undeserved negative performance review and refusal to consider for promotion. By contrast, we have held that declining to hold a job open for an employee and badmouthing an employee outside the job reference context do not constitute adverse employment actions.
Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 928-29 (9th Cir. 2000). The operative complaint specifies three alleged adverse employment actions: a "course of action includ[ing] removal of Plaintiff's duties, ostracism, violation of her privacy rights, refusal to accommodate her disabilities, and public humiliation," a denial of promotion based on race and/or disabilities, and an inability to return to Wastewater Division after completing a temporary assignment in DPW. (See TAC ¶¶ 7, 10-12). Defendant argues that none of these allegations [*16]  are negative employment actions. (Def.'s Mot. at 7.)
1. Adverse "Course of Action"
Plaintiff alleges that, starting in March 2012, Defendant engaged "in a course of action designed to force Plaintiff out of the Wastewater Division, . . . which 'included removal of Plaintiff's duties, ostracism, violation of her privacy rights, refusal to accommodate her disabilities, and public humiliation.'" (TAC ¶¶ 6-7.)
As an initial matter, the Ninth Circuit has held that "ostracism suffered at the hands of coworkers cannot constitute an adverse employment action." Brooks, 229 F.3d at 929 (citing Strother, 79 F.3d at 869 ("[M]ere ostracism in the workplace is not enough to show an adverse employment decision.")) (other citations omitted).
Defendant argues that the alteration of job responsibilities is not an adverse course of action. (Def.'s Mot. at 8.) An adverse employment action must "be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities." Thomas v. Dept. of Corrections, 77 Cal. App. 4th 507, 511, 91 Cal. Rptr. 2d 770 (2000). "A change that is merely contrary to the employee's interests or not to the employee's liking is insufficient[.]" Akers v. County of San Diego, 95 Cal. App. 4th 1441, 1455, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 602 (2002). Plaintiff fails to address this argument in her opposition, and, instead, claims, without identifying any legal authority, and without elaboration, that a loss [*17]  of earnings is an adverse employment action. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 14.) Rather, as alleged in the operative complaint, the loss of earnings are damages. (TAC ¶ 16.) There is no allegation that any loss of earnings was an adverse employment action. Thus, Plaintiff has waived any argument that the allegations in Paragraph 7 constitute an adverse employment action to establish a prima facie claim of race discrimination.
2. Failure to Promote
Plaintiff alleges that she was denied a promotion in March 2014 because of her race. (TAC ¶ 10.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff was not promoted because three other candidates were better suited, and three Public Utilities Commission ("PUC") managers, including Mark Harris, scored Plaintiff lower than the other three applicants on both the written test and interview. (Def.'s Mot. at 9; Ho Decl., Exs. 2-5.) There is no dispute that Christina Ting, who was the highest scoring applicant, was hired for the position. (Def.'s Mot. at 9; Ho Decl., Ex. 4; Pl.'s Opp'n at 14.)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the reason she was not promoted is because Ms. Ting was permitted attend the training in Georgia, which was denied to Plaintiff. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 14; Johnson [*18]  Decl. ¶ 40.) The City, however, contends that Ms. Ting's prior position had different responsibilities and a different assignment, which more urgently required the computer training. (Def.'s Mot. at 11.) Furthermore, Plaintiff's request for training was not a blanket denial, but was only denied because it was in Georgia, and not in California. (Def.'s Harris Dep. at 30:7-13.)
Regardless, Ms. Ting scored substantially higher than Plaintiff during the interview process. (Ho Decl., Ex. 4.) Plaintiff received the fourth highest overall score out of seven applicants. Id. An employer's articulation of a facially nondiscriminatory reason shifts the burden back to the plaintiff to show that the employer's reason was a pretext for discrimination. See St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993). "The ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff." Id. Since the City offered a legitimate business reason for not promoting Plaintiff, she must then provide evidence of pretext. Plaintiff provides no such evidence, and, therefore, fails to carry her burden to show that being denied the promotion was an adverse employment action.
To [*19]  the extent that Plaintiff argues that Arkadiy Yashprakh's alleged promotion to Maintenance Planner was an adverse employment action, she never raised that in the EEOC or DFEH charges or in the third amended complaint. (See Pl.'s Opp'n at 2; Def.'s Reply at 12.) Thus, she is barred from making any claim based on Mr. Yashprakh's status for failure to exhaust her administrative remedies. See Rodriguez v. Airborne Express, 265 F.3d 890, 897 (9th Cir. 2001)(Even allegations in the civil complaint that are outside of the scope of the administrative charge are barred for failure to exhaust.) Nevertheless, Mr. Yashprakh was not promoted to a permanent position as Plaintiff alleges. (Def.'s Reply at 13.) Instead, he was given a Maintenance Planner assignment on a temporary basis in 2014, in the same way Plaintiff was able to serve as an acting Maintenance Planner with DPW a year later. (Def.'s Reply at 13; Ho Reply Decl. ¶ 4.) The position Mr. Yashprakh temporarily filled has since been deleted from the budget. (Ho Reply Decl. ¶ 4.) Therefore, there was no available promotion and no adverse employment action.
3. Attempt to return to work at Public Utilities Commission
Plaintiff alleges that she attempted to return to Wastewater Division from a temporary assignment [*20]  in March 2015, but Defendant falsely claimed that there were no vacant Stationary Engineer positions in the Wastewater Division that Plaintiff could perform with or without reasonable accommodations. (TAC ¶¶ 11-12.)
Defendant argues that "the record shows that the City thoroughly searched for suitable positions within Wastewater, across the PUC, and Citywide." (Def.'s Mot. at 9; Castellanos Decl. ¶¶ 21-25, Exs. B-D; Ho Decl. Exs. 1-L, 1-Y.) Defendant claims that Johnson refused to consider any position for which she was both qualified and cleared to perform by her doctor. (Def.'s Mot. at 9.) Plaintiff admits that she declined to consider positions at 525 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco and in Millbrae, because she did not want to work there. (Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 78, 119.) Voluntary actions in an employee's self-interest are not adverse employment actions. See Knappenberger v. City of Phoenix, 566 F.3d 936, 941-942 (9th Cir. 2009). In fact, Defendant claims that "there is no evidence that Johnson's Stationary Engineer position, and its attendant compensation and privileges, have changed during 13 years of employment with the City," and that Plaintiff still retains her right to the position. (Def.'s Mot. at 9; Ho Decl. ¶ 17; Castellanos Decl. ¶ 6.)
As discussed [*21]  in detail below, the evidence supports the City's position that they searched for suitable positions within Wastewater, PUC, and Citywide. See discussion infra Part III.A.ii.c. Plaintiff does not provide any admissible evidence from which inferences can be made to create a genuine dispute that Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action.
b. Plaintiff was not replaced
The Court notes that, even if Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, her position remains vacant, so she was not replaced. In fact, Plaintiff still retains her right to return to that position. (Castellanos Decl. ¶ 6.) Thus, Plaintiff cannot satisfy this element of the prima facie case.
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case for race discrimination, and, therefore, summary judgment must be granted for counts one and two of the third amended complaint.

ii. Disability Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff alleges disability discrimination claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and FEHA, as well as failure to provide reasonable accommodation, and engage in an interactive process. (TAC ¶¶ 31-37, 50-54.)
Under the ADA and FEHA, Plaintiff must establish that (1) she is a disabled [*22]  person within the meaning of either statute; (2) that she is a qualified individual with a disability, which means that she can perform the essential functions of the position, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) she suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Sanders v. Arneson Prod., Inc., 91 F.3d 1351, 1354 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S.Ct. 1247 (1997); Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 254, 254 n. 3, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000); Deschene v. Pinole Point Steel Co., 76 Cal.App.4th 33, 34, 90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 15 (1999).2 In analyzing both federal and state discrimination claims, courts use the same burden-shifting test used in Title VII cases. See McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 792.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims fail because there is no evidence she suffered any adverse employment action because of her disability. (Def.'s Mot. at 16.) The City also claims that it made every effort to accommodate Plaintiff, and engaged in an interactive process over the course of several years to find work that she could perform, with or without accommodation. Id. Additionally, the City contends that Johnson concurs with her medical providers that she cannot perform the essential functions of her Stationary Engineer position, with or without reasonable accommodation. (Def.'s Mot. at 16.) In the opposition, as well as at the hearing, Plaintiff conceded that she could not perform the Stationary Engineer [*23]  position, with or without reasonable accommodation. (See Pl.'s Opp'n at 1.) Lastly, the City argues that Plaintiff not only refused every other position the City has located for her, but has also ceased participating in the interactive process, which is fatal to her claim. (Def.'s Mot. at 16, 21.)
a. Adverse Employment Action
For the same reasons discuss above in connection with the race discrimination claim, Plaintiff has not suffered an adverse employment action. See discussion supra Part III.A.i.a. Thus, her disability discrimination claims fail, because she cannot establish a prima facie case.
b. Whether Plaintiff can perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation.
Even if Plaintiff could show that she suffered an adverse employment action, she concedes that she cannot perform all of the essential functions of the 7372 Stationary Engineer position. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 1.) As an initial matter, Plaintiff contends that the inability to perform the essential functions is an affirmative defense that must be asserted by Defendant. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 10-11.) This is incorrect, as the ability to perform the essential functions of the position is an element [*24]  of the prima facie case. See discussion supra Part III.A.ii. Therefore, if Plaintiff cannot perform the essential functions of the Stationary Engineer position, her disability discrimination claims cannot survive summary judgment for failure to place her in that position.
Notwithstanding, Plaintiff argues that Defendant's contention that she must be able to perform all of the essential functions in the "general position description" is incorrect. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 6.) Plaintiff cites Dark v. Curry County in support of this proposition, but the case supports the opposite conclusion. Indeed, "[t]he term 'essential functions' refers to the 'fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires.'" Dark v. Curry Cty., 451 F.3d 1078, 1087 (9th Cir. 2006). "It does not 'include the marginal functions of the position.'" Id. (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1)). The statute provides that "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of the job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3); Dark, 451 F.3d at 1087. Plaintiff does not cite to any [*25]  evidence that she can either perform all of the essential functions-she actually concedes that she cannot-nor does she argue that the "essential functions" are really marginal functions of the position.
Thus, Plaintiff's failure to produce any evidence to show that the functions Defendant identifies as "essential" are actually marginal, means that no genuine dispute exists. See Bhan, 929 F.2d at 1409. That Plaintiff is admittedly unable to perform the essential functions of the 7372 Stationary Engineer position, with or without accommodation, precludes a disability discrimination claim based on the failure to reinstate her to this position.
c. Availability of other positions for which Plaintiff was qualified
Since Plaintiff is admittedly unable to perform the essential functions of the 7372 Stationary Engineer position, she may, as a reasonable accommodation, be "reassign[ed] to a vacant position." Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 225, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). Where an employee's preferred accommodation "in essence requires not an accommodation but a redefinition of his job . . . '[the] employer is not required by the ADA to create a new job for an employee.'" Mulloy v. Acushnet Co., 460 F.3d 141, 153 (1st Cir. 2006)(citing Phelps v. Optima Health, Inc., 251 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2001)); see also Watkins v. Ameripride Servs., 375 F.3d 821, 828 (9th Cir. 2004). Nor is an employer required "to re-establish a position that no longer exists." Phelps v. Optima Health, Inc., 251 F.3d at 27.
Defendant [*26]  acknowledges that it was under an obligation to engage in an interactive process with Plaintiff to determine whether there were alternative positions available that she could perform. (Def.'s Mot. at 18.) Defendant attempted to place Plaintiff in the following positions: 1704 Communications Dispatcher, 1705 Sr. Communications Dispatcher, 7334 Stationary Engineer, 1478 Senior Water Services Clerk (twice), 1480 Principal Water Services Clerk (twice), 2481 Water Quality Technician (twice), 1428 Unit Clerk, 1408 Principal Clerk (twice), and 8238 Police Communication Dispatcher. (Def.'s Reply at 5-6; Castellanos Decl. ¶¶ 27-28; Ho Decl. Ex. 1-Y; cf. Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 116-124.) Plaintiff admits that she was not interested in the Dispatcher, Unit Clerk, Principal Water Services Clerk, and Senior Water Services Clerk positions. (Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 82-83, 116, 119.)
In order to survive summary judgment, Plaintiff "must identify a reasonable accommodation that was available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 995, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). Thus, Plaintiff must identify an available, vacant, funded position that existed during the interactive process, which began in March 2015, upon the conclusion of her [*27]  assignment with DPW. (Ho Decl. ¶ 42.) The Court notes that Plaintiff's opposition cites to only one of the 88 exhibits attached to her supporting declaration. (See Pl.'s Opp'n at 1 (citing Johnson Decl., Ex. 88).)3
Without citing to other evidence, Plaintiff argues that she could perform the following positions with or without accommodation: Waste Quality Technician, Principal Water Services Clerk, Public Safety Communications Dispatcher, Coveralls Coordinator, Waste Water Control Inspector, and Quality and Reliability Efficiency Program ("QREP") positions. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 5-6 (citing Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 70-82, 84-88, 97-108, 110-115, 117, 120, 123, 125).) As an initial matter, Defendant objects to this list of positions contained in Plaintiff's declaration, because it is significantly enlarged from the list contained in the August 31, 2015 email to Michael Ho. (Def.'s Reply at 7.) In the August 31, 2015 email, Plaintiff identified the following Stationary Engineer positions as positions that she was qualified to perform: SF Grease Cycle-Biofuel, WWE Saftey/Emergency Preparedness Department, QREP, Asset Management, and Sewer Operations. (8/31/15 Email, Ho Decl., Ex. 1-O.) Plaintiff also [*28]  stated that she was qualified to perform the Maintenance Planner-Planning Department position. Id. At her deposition, Plaintiff confirmed that those were the positions that she was qualified to perform, and that the list may be shorter due to stress, anxiety, and depression. (Def.'s Johnson Dep. at 124:11-125:16.) Plaintiff cannot now add new positions to contradict her earlier testimony in a self-serving declaration.
More importantly, Plaintiff fails to identify any specific vacant, funded, and available positions in her opposition. Plaintiff has the burden of showing the existence of a vacant, available position for which she is qualified. Watkins v. Ameripride Servs., 375 F.3d 821, 828 (9th Cir. 2004). Instead, her voluminous declaration describes numerous positions that appear to be unavailable, unfunded, or filled, and the available positions she was not interested in pursuing because of the job or the location. For example, Plaintiff claims to have been qualified for the 2481 Water Quality Technician position, but the position was located in Millbrae, California, and Plaintiff decided that she was not interested, because it was "too far to drive." (Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 77-78.) That Plaintiff could perform all of the essential functions of this [*29]  position, except for lifting the large sewer covers, is, therefore, immaterial if there were no available positions that she was interested in pursuing. (See Johnson Decl. ¶ 79.)
Another position Plaintiff claims she was qualified for is the 1478 Sr. Water Services Clerk vacancy, but she admits that she did not have a college degree, which was a minimum qualification. (Johnson Decl. ¶ 84.) In fact, Plaintiff was informed that a college degree was required for any classification that earned the same or comparable salary as a 7372 Stationary Engineer. Id. Plaintiff further claims that there was a vacancy for the 1480 Principal Water Services Clerk by SFPUC HR, but that she was informed that she "had not established that [she] met the minimum qualifications . . . despite all of [her] administrative work experience, duties, and assignments at SFPUC and DPW. (Johnson Decl. ¶ 102, Ex. 79.) The 1480 Principal Water Service Clerk position, however, was either not available or was located at 525 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, a building in which Plaintiff was unwilling to work. (Johnson Decl., Ex. 79 at 1.)
To the extent that other positions may have been truly available, Plaintiff fails [*30]  to cite to any evidence in her opposition to suggest that the unfilled positions were funded, but to the extent that such a position is described in her declaration, the Court is not required to scour the hundreds of pages in her declaration and attached exhibits to determine the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.4 In fact, Plaintiff's statement that possible positions were "open" due to retirement or death does not mean that they were funded and unfilled. (Cf. Johnson Decl. ¶ 125.) The declaration of Michael C. Ho, filed in support of Defendant's reply brief, addresses each of those "available" positions in Paragraph 125 of Plaintiff's declaration and confirms that none of them were available during the 19 month period. (Decl. of Michael C. Ho in support of Def.'s Reply, "Ho Reply Decl.," Dkt. No. 74-1 ¶ 6.) Thus, Plaintiff has failed to provide any admissible evidence that the positions she was purportedly qualified for were available, funded, and unfilled.
Moreover, Plaintiff applied for Social Security Disability Benefits in 2015, in which she stated that, as of March 30, 2015, she is "unable to work because of [her] disabling condition. (Appl. Summary for Disability [*31]  Insurance Benefits, Walczak Decl., Ex. F.) To defeat summary judgment, the plaintiff must explain the inconsistency with applying for benefits and pursuing a disability discrimination claim, and "that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff's good-faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless 'perform the essential functions' of her job, with or without 'reasonable accommodation.'" Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 807, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999). Here, Plaintiff does not attempt to provide any explanation or reconcile her disability insurance application, and, instead, states only that she "can return to work with reasonable accommodation." (Pl.'s Opp'n at 8.) At the hearing, Plaintiff explained that her benefits application should not preclude the instant lawsuit, because there were no positions available with the City and County of San Francisco that Plaintiff could perform because she required reasonable accommodations. Not only does this argument disregard the standard for the award of benefits, which requires that the claimant be unable to perform any positions that exists in significant numbers in the national economy, but it in fails [*32]  to reconcile her application with her claim that she can perform the essential functions of her prior position or any vacant, funded position with accommodations.
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff has failed to establish that there were available, vacant, funded positions that she was qualified to perform.
d. Whether Plaintiff Engaged in the Interactive Process in Good Faith
Plaintiff argues that the City refused to engage in the interactive process in good faith, and instead "insist[ed] that it ha[d] a right to rely on a personnel file and generalized job descriptions rather than consult with the disabled individual and analyze the particular job." (Pl.'s Opp'n at 7.) Plaintiff's own declaration and exhibits, however, show that the City engaged in the interactive process via letter and email over several years, including after this lawsuit was filed. (See, e.g., Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 75-99.) Silvia Castellanos and Michael Ho met and corresponded with Plaintiff and analyzed the particular jobs in light of her abilities, qualifications, and preferences. (Def.'s Reply at 6 (citing Castellanos Decl. ¶¶ 21-28; Ho Decl. ¶¶ 20-66, Exs. 1-11).) Plaintiff does not dispute that any of the meetings, [*33]  calls, e-mails, or analyses took place. (Def.'s Reply at 6.) Plaintiff has not, therefore, provided any admissible evidence from which the Court can infer that the interactive process was not conducted in good faith. To the contrary, the evidence she provides suggests that it was.
Defendant contends that Plaintiff stopped returning Ms. Castellano's phone calls and emails in April 2016. (Def.'s Reply at 6; Castellanos Decl. ¶¶ 31-35, Exs. B-D.) Plaintiff does not dispute this fact. Since the City has established that it participated in the interactive process, and worked with Plaintiff to find a suitable alternative position for her, the burden shifts to Plaintiff to establish that she rejected the available positions the City located for valid reasons, because an employer's reasonable accommodation obligation is satisfied when it offers a position that the employee could perform despite her disability, which the employee declines. See Watkins v. Ameripride Servs., 375 F.3d 821, 828-29 (9th Cir. 2004). Moreover, an employer is entitled to summary judgment if it "did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith." Smith v. Grumman, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168426, 2015 WL 8770718, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2015) (quoting [*34]  Dep't of Fair Emp't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d 728, 743-44 (9th Cir. 2011)).
As discussed above, Plaintiff rejected or failed to consider positions because she did not wish to work at certain locations or due to lack of parking and other reasons. See discussion supra Part III.A.ii.c. She is further unable to identify any available, vacant, funded position for which she was qualified during the interactive process. See id. As she does not dispute the fact that she ceased engaging in the interactive process, summary judgment must be granted as to Plaintiff's twelfth cause of action for failure to engage in the interactive process.
e. Failure to accommodate
Plaintiff's eleventh cause of action is for failure to accommodate. (TAC ¶¶ 50-51.) An employer can prevail on a reasonable accommodation claim by showing: "(1) [a] reasonable accommodation was offered and refused; [or] (2) there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation[.]" Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). Since Plaintiff cannot establish that she was a qualified individual capable of performing the essential functions of the position, she cannot establish a prima facie case for failure [*35]  to accommodate. Romero v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 666 Fed. Appx. 609, 2016 WL 6648700, at *1 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1237 (9th Cir. 2012).
Thus, summary judgment must be granted as to the cause of action for failure to accommodate.

iii. Retaliation claims
The ninth and tenth causes of action allege retaliation under federal and state law. (TAC ¶¶ 45-49.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie retaliation claim, which requires her to demonstrate that (1) she engaged in a protected activity, (2) she was subjected to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action. McAlindin v. Cty. of San Diego, 192 F.3d 1226, 1238 (9th Cir. 1999), opinion amended on denial of reh'g, 201 F.3d 1211 (9th Cir. 2000).
As discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to produce any admissible evidence of an adverse employment action. Therefore, her prima facie case for retaliation fails, and the Court need not address whether she engaged in protected activity. See discussion supra Part III.A.i.a. Additionally, even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case, as with her discrimination claims, where Defendant offers a legitimate business reason for the PUC's actions, Plaintiff must then provide evidence of pretext. McAlindin, 192 F.3d at 1238. Again, Plaintiff cannot meet her burden.
Accordingly, summary judgment is granted as to the retaliation claims.

iv. Failure [*36]  to Prevent Discrimination
Plaintiff's thirteenth cause of action is for failure to prevent discrimination in violation of California Government Code § 12940(k). (TAC ¶¶ 55-56.) As summary judgment is granted as to all of Plaintiff's discrimination claims, see supra, summary judgment must also be granted as to Plaintiff's claim for failure to prevent discrimination.

B. Plaintiff's Objections to Defendant's Exhibits
Plaintiff objects to the declarations of Michael C. Ho and Silvia Castellanos on the grounds that the correspondence is offered "as proof of the unsupported conclusions" contained in the respective declarations. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 16.)
Instead of addressing the exhibits and the applicable paragraphs of the declarations individually, however, Plaintiff merely cites the exhibit and paragraph numbers and states that they are untrustworthy. Credibility is not a proper basis for objection. Defendant, however, has established that the relevant correspondences are business records, so Plaintiff's hearsay objections are overruled. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(6).
Plaintiff further argues that Mr. Ho's declaration does not explain what the essential functions of the Maintenance Planner, Water Quality Technician, or other positions specified by Plaintiff. [*37]  (Pl.'s Opp'n at 16.) By way of example, Plaintiff objects to Exhibit 1-Z of Mr. Ho's declaration, because the Court is asked to assume the accuracy of the medical form. Id. That exhibit, however, is a business record, so Plaintiff's claim that the form does not accurately represent the essential functions of the Water Quality Technician position requires her to produce admissible evidence to show what the essential functions are, and some evidence that Plaintiff can perform those essential functions. This information, however, should be provided in relation to the disability discrimination claims not as a basis of objection.
Similarly, Plaintiff objects to Ms. Castellanos's declaration on the grounds that it is untrustworthy. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 16-17.) Again, credibility is not a proper ground for objection.
Accordingly, all of Plaintiff's objections are overruled.

C. Plaintiff's request to take additional depositions is denied.
While not contained in the opposition itself, Plaintiff's counsel's accompanying declaration and proposed order request permission to take the depositions of Mr. Powell and Ms. Flores, and to reopen the deposition of Mr. Harris so that he may testify on new matter, [*38]  prior to trial. (See Decl. of Richard M. Rogers, Dkt. No. 72 ¶ 6.) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) gives the court the discretion to allow the taking of discovery prior to deciding a motion for summary judgment "[i]f a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition. . . ." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d)(2). Here, Plaintiff merely seeks to take the depositions prior to trial, rather than requesting an opportunity to obtain additional discovery to oppose the motion for summary judgment, so Rule 56(d) does not apply. Since the Court is granting the motion for summary judgment in full, Plaintiff's request to take additional depositions is denied as moot.

IV. CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, Defendant City and County of San Francisco's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, as she has failed to set forth sufficient facts through admissible evidence showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. Plaintiff's request to take additional depositions prior to trial is DENIED as moot.
