Opinion



ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
Re: Dkt. Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22
On March 17, 2021, Defendant RSTP Investments LLC ("Defendant") filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff Rafael Arroyo's ("Plaintiff") Complaint (Dkt. 1). Dkt. 13. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint ("FAC") on March 31, 2021. Dkt. 14. The Court denied as moot Defendant's motion to dismiss (Dkt. 13). Dkt. 15. Defendant now moves to dismiss Plaintiff's FAC pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Dkt. 19. The Parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge. Dkts. 7, 13-4.
Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), the Court deems the motion to dismiss suitable for determination without oral argument. Accordingly, the motion hearing set for June 22, 2021 is taken off calendar. Having carefully [*2]  considered the Parties' submissions, the case file, and the relevant law, and for the reasons discussed below, Defendant's motion to dismiss is DENIED.

I. BACKGROUND
This discussion of the background facts is based on the allegations in Plaintiff's FAC. Plaintiff is a paraplegic and uses a wheelchair for mobility. Dkt. 14 ¶ 1. Defendant owns and operates the Hotel Clariana located at 100 E. Santa Clara St., San Jose, California 95113. Id. ¶ 2. Plaintiff planned on making a trip to the San Jose, California area in April 2021 and chose Hotel Clariana because this hotel potentially worked for him. Id. ¶ 12-13. On December 19, 2020, Plaintiff went to the Hotel Clariana reservation website to book an accessible room. Id. ¶ 16. Plaintiff alleges that the website provides insufficient information about the accessible features in the accessible rooms. Id. ¶ 18. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that the website says nothing regarding the hotel outside of the actual guestrooms themselves. Id. ¶ 20. Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that the website provides insufficient information for the ADA accessible rooms. Id. ¶¶ 21-27. Plaintiff alleges that this lack of information caused difficulty and discomfort, [*3]  deterring him from booking a room at the Hotel Clariana. Id. ¶ 30. Plaintiff brings causes of actions for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. section 12101, et seq. ("ADA"), and the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code sections 51-53 ("Unruh Act"). Id. ¶¶ 34-41. Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, damages, and attorney's fees and costs.

II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE

A. Legal Standard
"Judicial notice under Rule 201 permits a court to notice an adjudicative fact if it is 'not subject to reasonable dispute.'" Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., 899 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. 2018), cert. denied sub nom. Hagan v. Khoja,     U.S.    , 139 S.Ct. 2615, 204 L.Ed.2d 264 (2019) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)). A fact is "not subject to reasonable dispute" if it "is generally known" or "can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned." Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(1)-(2). "A court may take judicial notice of 'matters of public record' without converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment." Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing MGIC Indem. Corp. v. Weisman, 803 F.2d 500, 504 (9th Cir. 1986)). However, "[j]ust because the document itself is susceptible to judicial notice does not mean that every assertion of fact within that document is judicially noticeable for its truth." Khoja, 899 F.3d at 999.

B. Analysis
Defendant asks the Court to take judicial notice of the following:
(1) Department of Justice ("DOJ") entitled "Americans with Disabilities Act Title III Regulations: Nondiscrimination on the Basis of [*4]  Disability by Public Accommodation and in Commercial Facilities." 28 C.F.R. Part 36, App. A;

(11) Love [*5]  v. Cow Hollow Motor Inn Associates, L.P., 20-CV-07525-SK (N.D. Feb. 17, 2021), Cow Hollow's Notice of Motion and Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 22 Ex. I);

(13) Love v. Cow Hollow Motor Inn Associates, L.P., 20-CV-07525-SK (N.D. Feb. 17, 2021), Cow Hollow's Decision (Dkt. 22 Ex. K).The Court "may take judicial notice of court filings and other matters of public record." Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, Inc., 442 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 (9th Cir. 2006). Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's request for judicial notice of Department of Justice's "Americans with Disabilities Act Title III Regulations: Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability by Public Accommodation and in Commercial Facilities," Plaintiff's Complaint and FAC,1 and Exhibits F-K. 28 C.F.R. Part 36, App. A; see Fed. R. Evid. 201. Websites and their contents may be proper subjects for judicial notice. Threshold Enter. Ltd. Pressed Juicery, Inc., 445 F. Supp. 3d 139, 146 (N.D. Cal. 2020). Plaintiff does not object to Defendant's request for judicial notice of Hotel Clariana's website pages and references them in his Complaint and opposition. Dkt. 14 ¶¶ 16-22; Dkt. 20 at 12. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's request for judicial notice of Exhibits A-D. See Barnes v. Marriott Hotel Services, Inc., No.15-cv-01409-HRL, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22588, 2017 WL 635474, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2017) (taking judicial notice of several pages of the hotel website describing the accessibility features of the hotel and of specific accessible room types). The Court does not rely on the [*6]  documents submitted as Exhibit E to Defendant's request for judicial notice. Accordingly, the Court DENIES AS MOOT Defendant's request for judicial notice as to Exhibit E.

III. MOTION TO DISMISS

A. Legal Standard
Under Rule 12(b)(6), a district court must dismiss a complaint if it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the court may consider only "the complaint, materials incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which the court may take judicial notice." Metzler Inv. GMBH v. Corinthian Colls., Inc., 540 F.3d 1049, 1061 (9th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). In deciding whether the plaintiff has stated a claim, the court must assume the plaintiff's allegations are true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. Usher v. City of L.A., 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987). However, the court is not required to accept as true "allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences." In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig., 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).
To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the plaintiff must allege "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). This "facial plausibility" standard requires the plaintiff to allege facts that add up to "more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).
Courts should [*7]  freely give leave to amend unless the district court determines that it is clear that the complaint's deficiencies cannot be cured by amendment. Lucas v. Dep't of Corr., 66 F.3d 245, 248 (9th Cir. 1995). When amendment would be futile, the court may dismiss without leave to amend. Dumas v. Kipp, 90 F.3d 386, 393 (9th Cir. 1996).

B. Analysis

1. Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA")
Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against disabled individuals in public accommodations. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). The Ninth Circuit has determined that a plaintiff can pursue injunctive relief even if he or she did not actually visit the hotel. See Civil Rights Educ. & Enf't Ctr. v. Hosp. Props. Tr., 867 F.3d 1093, 1099 (9th Cir. 2017). To succeed on a discrimination claim under Title III, a plaintiff must prove that "(1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) the plaintiff was denied public accommodations by the defendant because of his disability." Arizona ex rel. Goddard v. Harkins Amusement Enters., Inc., 603 F.3d 666, 670 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 730 (9th Cir.2007)).
28 C.F.R. § 36.302(e) ("Reservations Rule") requires a public accommodation's reservation system to "(ii) [i]dentify and describe accessible features in the hotels and guest rooms offered through its reservation service in enough detail to reasonably permit individuals with disabilities to assess independently whether a given hotel or guest room meets his [*8]  or her accessibility needs." Further, the Department of Justice ("DOJ") has issued commentary to the Reservations Rule, indicating that "a reservations system is not intended to be an accessibility survey." See 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App. A, "Title III Regulations 2010 Guidance and Section-by-Section Analysis" (the "2010 Guidance"). The 2010 Guidance further explains that "[f]or hotels that were built in compliance with the 1991 Standards, it may be sufficient to specify that the hotel is accessible and, for each accessible room, to describe the general type of room (e.g., deluxe executive suite), the size and number of beds (e.g., two queen beds), the type of accessible bathing facility (e.g., roll-in shower), and communications features available in the room (e.g., alarms and visual notification devices). Based on that information, many individuals with disabilities will be comfortable making reservations." Id. Additionally, the 2010 Guidance notes that "individuals with disabilities may wish to contact the hotel or reservations service for more detailed information" after making a reservation at which point hotel staff "should be available to provide additional information such as the specific layout of the [*9]  room and bathroom, shower design, grab-bar locations and other amenities available . . ." Id. While Plaintiff describes the 2010 Guidance as "musing commentary," the DOJ 2010 Guidance is "entitled to substantial deference." Kohler v. Presidio Int'l, Inc., 782 F.3d 1064, 1069 (9th Cir. 2015).
Numerous courts have concluded that the Reservations Rule is not intended to be an accessibility survey and that it does not require a hotel to include all potentially relevant accessibility information on its website. See Love v. KSSF Enters. Ltd., No. 20-cv-08535-LB, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51788, 2021 WL 1056604, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2021) (granting the motion to dismiss after finding that the hotel's website exceeds the requirements of the DOJ guidance and "has detailed descriptions of the guest rooms' accessibility features"); Love v. Marriott Hotel Servs., Inc., No. 20-cv-07137-TSH, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41081, 2021 WL 810252, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 3, 2021)2 (granting the motion to dismiss after determining that "the information provided under the website's accessibility tab goes beyond the 2010 Guidance"); Barnes, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22588, 2017 WL 635474, at *10 (finding website with similar descriptions and detail appropriate and acceptable under the DOJ's guidance); Strojnik v. Orangewood LLC, No. 19-00946 DSF (JCx), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11743, at *21 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 22, 2020), aff'd 829 F. App'x 783 (9th Cir. 2020) ("[W]ebsites need not include all potentially relevant accessibility information; if a website was required to have all relevant information, individuals would not need to call the hotel to get further information."); Strojnik v. 1315 Orange LLC, No. 19-cv-1991-LAB (JLB), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185481, 2019 WL 5535766, at *2 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 25, 2019) (granting motion to dismiss and finding that plaintiff failed to cite [*10]  any authority "suggesting a hotel has an obligation to describe to the public the physical layout of its rooms in exhaustive detail without being asked"); Rutherford v. Evans Hotels, LLC, No. 18-CV-435 JLS (MSB), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161565, 2020 WL 5257868, at *17 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2020) ("[J]ust because [plaintiff] would like additional detail does not mean that he is entitled to it under Section 36.302(e)(1)(ii).").
Defendant contends that Hotel Clariana's website provides adequate descriptions of its ADA accessible rooms. Dkt. 19 at 12-13. Defendant argues that Hotel Clariana "went beyond the guidelines by providing photographs of the accessible room and features in its website." Id. at 13 (citing Dkt. 19-2 Ex. C). Specifically, Defendant asserts that "[f]rom the photographs, Plaintiff can easily see the grab bars at the shower stall, grab bars at the toilet, the height of the bathroom mirror and whether or not the plumbing under the sink is wrapped." Id. Defendant argues that "[i]t is self-explanatory" and "self-evident" that there are sufficient paths to access the ADA accessible rooms. Id. at 8, 13. Additionally, Defendant contends that Hotel Clariana's "accessibility" webpage states that the hotel has ADA Accessible rooms available that are "in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act" and provides a phone number [*11]  to contact the hotel for assistance. Id. at 8, 13.
Based on the DOJ's 2010 Guidance and cases discussed above, the Court finds that the accessibility descriptions of Hotel Clariana's guest rooms in Exhibits B and C of Defendant's request for judicial notice are sufficient and comply with the regulations. As reflected in Exhibits B and C, Hotel Clariana's website provides information for the ADA accessible king room, which includes extra space and a roll in shower. Dkt. 19-2 Ex. B-C; see also Dkt. 14 ¶ 22; compare Whitaker v. Casa Madrona Hotel and Spa, LLC, 21-cv-00629-EMC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79687, 2021 WL 1615372, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 26, 2021) (finding that the accessibility information on the website was not always easily locatable and "some information is not provided until after a user takes steps to book a room and even then the link to the information is not conspicuous"). The photographs of the ADA accessible king room on the website depict the grab bar and seat in the shower stall as well as the grab bar at the toilet. Additionally, as stated above, the 2010 Guidance states that "[f]or hotels that were built in compliance with the 1991 Standards, it may be sufficient to specify that the hotel is accessible." Hotel Clariana's website explicitly states that it "ha[s] ADA Accessible rooms that are available [*12]  to our guests" and it is "in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act." Dkt. 19-2 Ex. D; see Love v. Wildcats Owner LLC, 532 F. Supp. 3d 872, 2021 WL 1253739, at *6 (N.D. Cal. 2021) ("It makes less sense to require fully compliant hotels to specifically identify their already compliant features when such features are the only way to satisfy the ADA's requirements."). Additionally, Hotel Clariana's website conspicuously states that guests can call the hotel for assistance and provides the telephone number. Dkt. 19-2 Ex. D. "[T]he 2010 Guidance cited above makes clear that details about a hotel's accessible features - 'such as the specific layout of the room and bathroom, shower design, grab-bar locations, and other amenities available (e.g., bathtub bench)' can be provided 'once reservations are made' and do not have to be provided on the reservations website." Marriott Hotel Servs., Inc., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41081, 2021 WL 810252, at *7 (citing 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App. A, "Title III Regulations 2010 Guidance and Section-by-Section Analysis"). "This is important because the 2010 Guidance acknowledges that 'individuals with disabilities may wish to contact the hotel or reservations services for more detailed information,' 2010 Guidance, which further supports a finding that the Hotel's website does not violate the Reservations Rule." Love v. Ashford San Francisco II LP, No. 20-cv-08458-EMC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73148, 2021 WL 1428372, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 15, 2021); see also Orangewood LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11743, at *21 ("This provides [*13]  further support that websites need not include all potentially relevant accessibility information; if a website was required to have all relevant information, individuals would not need to call the hotel to get further information.").
However, Plaintiff's FAC added an allegation stating that "[w]ith respect to the entire hotel outside of the actual guestrooms themselves, [Hotel Clariana's] website says absolutely nothing . . . There is not a single accessible feature identified for the entirety of the hotel, outside of the guest rooms themselves." Dkt. 14 ¶ 20; Dkt. 19 at 5, 8; Dkt. 20 at 12. The Court agrees that there is no information provided regarding the hotel common areas outside of the actual guest rooms. "This is not to say that the Court is finding, as a matter of law, that the Hotel has violated the ADA regulation above. Indeed, the Hotel has a fair argument that, based on the undisputed evidence about the website, a reasonable jury could well find in its favor . . . ." Casa Madrona Hotel and Spa, LLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79687, 2021 WL 1615372, at *1. Nonetheless, at the 12(b)(6) stage in the litigation, drawing all inferences in Plaintiff's favor, it is plausible that a reasonable jury could find that Defendant's disclosures on its website regarding [*14]  the hotel common areas outside of the guest rooms are not sufficient. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's FAC is DENIED.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Defendant's answer to the FAC is due within 14 days of the date of this order.
SO ORDERED.
