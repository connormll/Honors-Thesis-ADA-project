Opinion



MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is currently before the Court on Defendant DeKalb County, Georgia's ("Defendant") Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 57). For the reasons explained below, this Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. (Doc. 57).

DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Daisy Abdur-Rahman ("Plaintiff") brings claims against Defendant under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (collectively, the "ADA"). (Compl., Doc. 1, ¶ 2). Plaintiff alleges Defendant discriminated against her by requiring that she be 100% before returning to work, denying her reasonable accommodations, retaliating against her for engaging in protected activity, and terminating her employment because of her disabilities. (See generally Compl., Doc. 1). Defendant has moved for summary judgment, arguing Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because Plaintiff could not perform an essential function of her job as a Compliance [*2]  Inspector, namely inspect interior grease traps, and Plaintiff did not identify an accommodation that would allow her to do so. (Def.'s Br., Doc. 57-5, at 7-21). Defendant contends that Plaintiff also fails to identify a vacant position for which she was qualified. (Id. at 21-23). Defendant asserts that summary judgment should be granted as to Plaintiff's retaliation because Plaintiff's request for accommodation is not protected expression, and there is no evidence her letter threatening to file an ADA complaint was viewed by the individuals who made the decision to terminate her employment. (Id. at 23-25). In addition, Defendant argues Plaintiff has not shown any casual connection between the alleged protected expression and her termination. (Id. at 25-26). Finally, even if Plaintiff had established a prima facie case of retaliation, Defendant takes the position that it provided a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment, which Plaintiff has not countered with any evidence that it was pretextual. (Id. at 26-27).

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND1

A. Plaintiff's Job as a Compliance Inspector
Plaintiff worked for DeKalb County as one [*3]  of eight Compliance Inspectors in the Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) Program. (DSMF ¶ 1). Plaintiff's duties included inspecting interior grease traps and exterior grease interceptors for commercial kitchens. (DSMF ¶ 2). Plaintiff was required to inspect between four and seven restaurant grease traps each day. (DSMF ¶ 4). Exterior grease traps may be located in parking lots, landscaped areas, or other areas close to a restaurant. (DSMF ¶ 6). A Compliance Inspector must remove the cover of a grease trap to measure the amount of grease inside. (Deposition of Plaintiff ("Pl.'s Dep."), Doc. 56-1, at 49:22-50:18, 58:5-23). Exterior grease traps have manhole covers that weigh at least forty pounds. (DSMF ¶ 6). In DeKalb County, most of the grease traps are located inside restaurants. (DSMF ¶ 5). Interior grease traps are often under the floor and may be in areas with limited access, such as under sinks and tables. (DSMF ¶ 7). Interior grease traps are usually covered by a steel plate strong enough for a person to walk on. (DSMF ¶ 8).
Accessing interior grease traps is an essential function of the job, and Plaintiff makes no argument to the contrary. (See Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 1 (marking inspecting [*4]  grease traps as an essential function of the job)). Compliance inspectors open interior grease traps by loosening the lid, prying the metal plate loose with a screwdriver, and sliding the metal plate to one side. (Declaration of Plaintiff ("Pl.'s Decl."), Doc. 66-5, ¶ 5; Declaration of Ryan Petty ("Petty Decl.") ¶ 6; Pl.'s Dep. at 170:22-171:1, 215:23-24). An extra-long screwdriver is then inserted to measure the amounts of water and grease. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 5). Compliance Inspectors do not lift the lids of interior grease traps because they are slippery and unsafe. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 5, Petty Decl. ¶ 6). Lifting an interior grease trap lid can cause the grease to expand and cover the kitchen floor, which disrupts the kitchen. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 5).
Each Compliance Inspector was assigned to one of eight geographic zones in DeKalb County, each of which contained roughly the same number of restaurants. (DSMF ¶ 3). There were approximately 2,500 grease traps in DeKalb County, so each zone consisted of around 300 grease traps. (Deposition of Dora DeTaboada ("DeTaboada Dep.") at 73:1). In late 2014, Plaintiff was assigned to the zone that included South DeKalb Mall. (DSMF ¶ 4). In 2014 and 2015, Plaintiff [*5]  reported to Manager Dora DeTaboada. (DSMF ¶ 1). DeTaboada rotated the Compliance Inspectors to a new zone every three months. (DeTaboada Dep. at 79:22-23).

B. Plaintiff's Injury and Medical Leave
Plaintiff was in a car accident in November of 2014, which caused her to be out of work for over a year. (Pl.'s Dep. at 18:21-19:1, 20:8-16, 22:8-10). Plaintiff exhausted her leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, and Defendant gave her an additional seven months of medical leave. (Pl.'s Dep. at 74:20-24, 80:5-6, Exs. 3, 6, 8). Plaintiff attempted to return to work in September 2015 after being released by her physician, Dr. Remond Weinberg, to work with specific accommodations. (PSMF ¶ 18).
Between November 2014 and September 2015, Dr. Weinberg completed a series of disability certificates for Plaintiff. (Deposition of Dr. Remond Weinberg ("Weinberg Dep.") Exs. 13-24, 60-62; Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 25). The first thirteen disability certificates reveal that Plaintiff was unable to do her job as a Compliance Inspector, as Dr. Weinberg either advised that Plaintiff not work at all or provided specific restrictions on Plaintiff's ability to lift, sit, stand, run, twist, and bend that precluded her from working. (Weinberg Dep., [*6]  Exs. 13-23, 60-62).
On September 16, 2015, Dr. Weinberg wrote on a disability certificate that Plaintiff's tentative release date was September 28, 2015. (Weinberg Dep., Ex. 24). According to Dr. Weinberg, Plaintiff was still disabled, unable to lift more than twenty pounds from any position, and she required a "reasonable accommodation — e.g. truck mounted jib crane, entry step for truck to facilitate and ease that burden, and functional equipment to assist e.g. — magnetic manhole lifter." (Weinberg Dep. at 61:13-62:12, Ex. 24). This was the first time Dr. Weinberg mentioned possible accommodations in Plaintiff's disability certificates. (Weinberg Dep., Exs. 14-24, 60-62). Although Dr. Weinberg's September 16, 2015 disability certificate only limited Plaintiff's ability to lift, in his deposition, Dr. Weinberg stated that he generally would not have recommended that Plaintiff stoop, kneel, bend, push or pull more than twenty pounds, although it would depend on how far Plaintiff had to bend, how far she had to push the object, and how easy it was to push. (Weinberg Dep. at 66:1-67:12). On September 28, 2015, Dr. Weinberg filled out another disability certificate, releasing Plaintiff [*7]  to return to work inclusive of all work duties with the accommodations of the truck-mounted jib crane, entry step to truck, and magnetic manhole lifter. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 25). Dr. Weinberg also stated that if accommodations were not possible, Plaintiff would require additional medical leave. (Id.). Plaintiff still could not lift more than twenty pounds as of November 2015, the month she was terminated. (DSMF ¶ 25).
In his deposition, Dr. Weinberg admitted that he has no knowledge about how a jib crane or magnetic manhole lifter could accommodate Plaintiff's disabilities and had never used either device. (Weinberg Dep. at 63:20-25). According to Weinberg, Plaintiff told him she would need a jib crane, step for her truck, and magnetic manhole lifter to alleviate the burden of heavy lifting at her job. (Weinberg Dep. at 62:8-63:19). Plaintiff learned about the jib crane from a representative at the Job Accommodation Network, an organization she found through the FMLA website, and Plaintiff already knew about magnetic manhole lifters from trade magazines. (Pl.'s Dep. at 114:13-23, 118:5-8, 119:4-7). Dr. Weinberg had a basic understanding of Plaintiff's job duties based at least in part on [*8]  the physical requirements included as part of Plaintiff's job description. (Weinberg Dep. at 22:3-25:7). Dr. Weinberg recalled that Plaintiff's job required a certain amount of heavy lifting, bending, and twisting. (Weinberg Dep. at 20:12-16). Plaintiff states that she explained to Dr. Weinberg that she had to open interior grease traps with a wrench, slide the lid over, and insert a screwdriver. (Pl. Dep. at 170:18-171:6). Plaintiff says she also told Dr. Weinberg that she sometimes had to access grease traps located underneath tables. (Pl. Dep. at 171:2-6).

C. Reasonable Accommodations

1. Compliance Inspector Job
Plaintiff alleges her manager, DeTaboada, stated on numerous occasions that Plaintiff needed to be "perfect" or "100 percent" before returning to work. (Pl.'s Dep. at 37:10-11, 38:10-13, 123:20-22, 147:12-25). Plaintiff cites this statement as direct evidence of discrimination on the basis of disability. (Pl.'s Resp. Br., Doc. 66, at 14-16). Plaintiff did not ask DeTaboada what she meant by 100 percent. (Pl.'s Dep. at 81:19-25). DeTaboada denies making such a statement. (DeTaboada Dep. at 35:19-36:6). DeTaboada maintains that she told Plaintiff she could not come back until [*9]  she was ready to perform her job inspector duties. (DeTaboada Dep. at 45:16-46:17).
On August 15, 2015, Plaintiff wrote a letter to Zachary Williams, the Chief Operating Officer of DeKalb County, seeking an extension of unpaid medical leave. (Pl.'s Dep. at 110:17-112:22, Ex. 7). Plaintiff stated that she has been released to work with accommodation/restriction on several occasions, but she had been unable to return because she was told she must be 100 percent. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 7). Plaintiff sought an extension of her medical leave or temporary duty she was physically capable of doing. (Id.). Plaintiff received a letter from Charles Lambert, Interim Director of the Department of Watershed Management, dated August 20, 2015. (Pl.'s Dep. at 113-114, Ex. 8). The letter informed Plaintiff that she had to return to work on September 21, 2015, with appropriate medical documentation and that she must be able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation. (Id.).
As discussed above, on September 16, 2015, Dr. Weinberg advised that Plaintiff could not lift more than twenty pounds and recommended for the first time that Plaintiff be accommodated with a jib [*10]  crane, early step for her truck, and a magnetic manhole lifter. (Weinstein Dep., Ex. 24). Plaintiff provided Dr. Weinberg's disability certificates to several people at DeKalb County, including usually DeTaboada, her supervisor; Angela Wester2, the Assistant Director of Administration in the Watershed Department; and sometimes additional people. (Pl.'s Dep. at 83:21-84:23, DeTaboada Dep. at 51:4-53:5; (Declaration of Angela P. Wester ("Wester Decl."), Doc. 57-1, Decl. ¶ 1). Plaintiff brought one of her September disability certificates to DeTaboada in person in an effort to return to work. (Pl.'s Dep. at 115:24-116:6). DeTaboada said she needed to talk to someone else, and upon returning, told Plaintiff that she had to leave the office. (Pl.'s Dep. at 116:4-9). Plaintiff recalled DeTaboada saying at some point prior to November 5, 2015, that the County could not afford her requested accommodations, but DeTaboada denied ever making that statement. (Pl.'s Dep. at 96:3-9; DeTaboada Dep. at 100:20-101:2, 102:9-16).
Wester was responsible for reviewing Plaintiff's requests for reasonable accommodations. (Wester Decl. ¶ 6). Wester relied on DeTaboada's opinion about whether the proposed accommodations [*11]  would have allowed Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her job. (PSMF ¶ 16; Wester Dep. at 121:18-23, 122:10-13). The disability certificates dated September 16 and September 28, 2015, in which Dr. Weinberg recommended specific accommodations, did not specify that the magnetic manhole lifter would be mounted on a truck. (DeTaboada Dep., Exs. 13, 14; Plaintiff Dep., Exs. 24, 25). DeTaboada, however, believed that Dr. Weinberg's recommended accommodation of a magnetic manhole lifter referred to a truck-mounted magnetic manhole lifter. (DeTaboada Dep. at 85:14-20, 86:10-15).3 DeTaboada admits that she did not investigate any specific models of magnetic manhole lifters, whether mounted on a truck or not. (DeTaboada Dep. at 69:1-11, 91:7-92:13). Nor did DeTaboada ever speak with Dr. Weinberg. (DeTaboada Dep. at 101:25-102:4). DeTaboada believed that Plaintiff's limitations would interfere with transporting a magnetic manhole lifter inside and the device would still not allow Plaintiff to access some of the traps located under tables or in corners. (DeTaboada Dep. at 72:7-12, 90:23-91:3).
During her deposition, DeTaboada was presented with examples of magnetic manhole lifters, [*12]  including one that weighed twelve pounds and could lift over 500 pounds. (De Taboada Dep. at 126:3-22, Ex. 23). DeTaboada agreed that a magnetic manhole lifter could probably be used to access interior grease traps, although she questioned Plaintiff's ability to move it and whether Plaintiff would still have to twist and push. (DeTaboada Dep. at 126:3-129:25, Exs. 23-25). DeTaboada admitted she did not consider such a device as a possible accommodation for Plaintiff. (DeTaboada Dep. at 126:22-127:6, 129:17-130:2). DeTaboada was not aware of such a device when she met with Plaintiff in 2015, and Plaintiff did not describe such a device. (DeTaboada Dep. at 131:20-132:1). Plaintiff testified that her research found there were magnetic lifters that weighed between six and twenty-two pounds, but she never provided that information to the County. (Pl.'s Dep. at 127:14-16). Plaintiff claims to have located hand-held magnetic lifters that weighed seventeen and thirteen pounds in 2015. (Pl.'s Dep. at 239:24-240:1, 241:17-25). During his deposition, Dr. Weinberg testified that if the reasonable accommodations permitted Plaintiff to remove the grease trap covers, Plaintiff would have been able [*13]  to do the remainder of the job, which involved stooping, bending, looking inside the trap, and sticking a tool inside to measure the grease, five to eight times a day. (Weinberg Dep. at 74:10-75:15). Although Compliance Inspectors sometimes move objects other than the cover to access an interior grease trap, moving other objects is not an essential function of a Compliance Inspector's job. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 6; DeTaboada Dep. at 94:11-14, Errata Sheet).4
a. Moving Interior Grease Traps
The parties disagree about the weight of interior grease trap covers. Plaintiff estimated that the metal covers weigh between four and fifteen pounds and states that she had never encountered a cover that weighed twenty or more pounds. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 3; Pl.'s Dep. at 49:13-17, 144:9-11). Similarly, Ryan Petty, another Compliance Inspector, opined that interior grease trap covers weigh between four and eight pounds, adding that they are not lifted but slid to the right or left to gain access. (Petty Decl. ¶ 6). Petty also states that all Compliance Inspectors were given a magnetic manhole lifter around 2017 that weighed less than twenty pounds, but that they do not use them to lift the covers on interior grease [*14]  traps, as doing so is not necessary or recommended. (Petty Decl. ¶ 7). Petty opines, however, that the magnetic manhole lifters could be used to lift interior grease traps. (Petty Decl. ¶ 7).
On the other hand, DeTaboada testified that very few interior grease traps weigh less than 100 pounds, and a 100-pound grease trap has to have a cover that weighs fifty pounds according to manufacturers' specifications and industrial standards. (DeTaboada Dep. at 105:10-106:9). DeTaboada, however, had not weighed any of the interior grease trap covers. (DeTaboada Dep. at 103:7-12). Bernard Bethea, a Pretreatment Coordinator who supervised the FOG program, stated that the smallest grease traps allowed by ordinance have covers that weigh more than twenty pounds and the covers can weigh as much as seventy pounds. (Declaration of Bernard Bethea ("Bethea Decl."), Doc. 57-2, ¶¶ 1, 7). Bethea provided a document purporting to illustrate a "typical grease trap with specifications" as Exhibit 1, which is a list of grease trap interceptor parts, including thirteen different interceptor lids ranging from twenty pounds to one hundred fifty pounds. (Bethea Decl., Ex. 1). Bethea stated that in connection with [*15]  this case, he and two Compliance Inspectors gathered data about the interior grease traps in five restaurants in the South DeKalb mall using a scale and a Chatillon Force Gauge that measures the force needed to lift or pull an object. (Id. ¶ 8). Bethea did not say when he gathered the data, but Ryan Petty averred that Bethea took the photographs and measurements in December 2018. (Petty Decl. ¶ 4).
At the first location, the Mandarin Express, Bethea and his crew moved two fifty-pound bags of rice and two tables to access the grease trap. (Bethea Decl. ¶¶ 10-12). The space was limited, so according to Bethea, there was no room for any type of lifting device. (Bethea Decl. ¶ 12). Because there was no room to slide the grease trap cover, it had to be slid partway off the trap and then lifted away. (Id.). The cover weighed twenty-four pounds, and sliding it required fifteen pounds of pressure. (Id.). At the second location, a Dairy Queen, the grease trap cover weighed twenty pounds and had to be slid back and forth to free it from underneath a table leg. (Bethea Decl. ¶ 13). Removing the cover required holding the sides and sliding it back and forth with twenty-six pounds of force. (Id. [*16] ). Bethea states that a lifting device would not have been helpful because the cover had to be slid back and forth. (Id.). The third location, an American Deli, had two grease traps that required a large screwdriver to pry them up. (Bethea Decl. ¶ 14). Each cover weighed twenty-six pounds and required thirty-eight pounds of force to move. (Id.). The fourth location, a Cinnabon,5 the inspectors had to move boxes and tables and remove two large bolts with a wrench to access the grease trap cover. (Bethea Decl. ¶ 15). A non-removable table leg supporting a sink was on top of the grease trap, so the cover had to be pried up and slid back and forth before it could be lifted away. (Id.). The cover weighed sixty-four pounds and required twenty-two pounds of force to slide. (Id.). At the fifth location, Auntie Annie's, the grease trap was also under a non-removable sink leg and the cover had to be lifted at an angle and slid back and forth. (Bethea Decl. ¶ 16). The force required to move the cover was forty-three pounds, and the trap cover weighed seventy pounds. (Id.).

2. Changing Jobs as an Accommodation
Plaintiff asked DeTaboada "early on" if there was any other work she could do in the department. [*17]  (Pl.'s Dep. at 67:8-12). Although Plaintiff thought she could do other work in the department, she did not know of a vacant position she could have filled. (Pl.'s Dep. at 67:15-16, 68:7-9). Later, Plaintiff identified approximately twelve job postings on the DeKalb County Jobs website that she believed she was qualified to do. (Pl.'s Dep. at 128:24-129:1). Plaintiff's list included: GIS Specialist 3, Engineering Review Officer 3, Field Service Manager, Cross Control Specialist Assistant, Road And Drainage Operations Manager, Utility Billing Analyst, Waste Water Laboratory Technician, Utility Collection Specialist, Utility Collection Analyst, Storm Engineering Supervisor, and System Analyst. (Pl.'s Dep. at 129:3, 131:22-24, 134:5-135:2). Plaintiff admitted she did not speak to any of the hiring managers, know who decided to fill the positions, or speak to anyone at DeKalb County about the positions other than during the November 5, 2015 meeting. (Pl.'s Dep. at 132:5-13, 133:24-134:4). No one ever told Plaintiff she was qualified for any of the positions, and Plaintiff does not know why she did not receive any of the jobs. (Pl.'s Dep. at 133:19-134:4). At the time of her deposition, [*18]  Plaintiff could not remember the requirements for each of the positions. (Pl.'s Dep. at 132:5-9, 133:24-134:4).
In October/November 2015, the Human Resources Department conducted a search to determine if there was an available position for which Plaintiff qualified. (Declaration of Margaret Richwagen, Doc. 57-3, ("Richwagen Decl.") ¶ 4). The search took into consideration Plaintiff's current position, education qualifications, work experience, and medical limitations, but failed to identify an available position for which Plaintiff was qualified and could perform based on her medical restrictions. (Richwagen Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7). Plaintiff has a B.S. in Industrial Engineering and an M.S. in Public Policy from Georgia Tech. (Pl.'s Dep. at 65:3-12). Margaret Richwagen, the Deputy Director of Human Resources in DeKalb County, averred that the jobs identified by Plaintiff were among those reviewed by Human Resources, but Plaintiff did not receive any of them for reasons including requirements for educational degrees, experience, and physical effort, as well as the availability of the positions. (Richwagen Decl. ¶ 8). Specifically, the position as a Cross Connect Control Specialist had not been [*19]  available since 2011 and required lifting 51 pounds or more. (Richwagen Decl. ¶¶ 9-10). The position as a Utility Billing Analyst was filled in September 2015, prior to Plaintiff seeking alternative positions within DeKalb County. (Richwagen Decl. ¶ 11). The Utility Collections Analysis position was only available because of a department reorganization and was filled by a candidate with twenty-one years of experience in that department, including three years as a Revenue Collection Supervisor. (Richwagen Decl. ¶ 12).

3. November 5, 2015 Meeting
Angela Wester, the Assistant Director of Administration in the Department of Watershed Management, sent Plaintiff a letter and email in late October, informing Plaintiff that Wester had scheduled a meeting on November 5, 2015, to discuss Plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodations. (Deposition of Angela Wester ("Wester Dep.), Doc. 51-1, Exs. 18, 19). Present at the meeting were Plaintiff, Angela Wester, Dora DeTaboada, and Victoria Lowery, Plaintiff's sister-in-law. (Wester Dep. at 96:15-22, Pl's Dep. at 35:20-36:4; DeTaboada Dep. at 109:2-4). The accommodations that Plaintiff identified prior to the meeting were those listed in Dr. Weinberg's [*20]  disability certificate: a jib crane, a step for a truck, and a magnetic manhole lifter. (Weinberg Dep., Ex. 24; Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 25). At the meeting, DeTaboada stated that the requested accommodations would not allow Plaintiff to inspect the interior grease traps. (DeTaboada Dep. at 109:21-110:3; Pl.'s Dep. at 123:23-124:124). Wester recalled Plaintiff stating that the magnetic manhole lifter had to be mounted on the truck. (Wester Dep. at 102:1-8, 109:13-20). Similarly, Plaintiff's testified during her deposition that a magnetic manhole lifter would not be useful for interior grease traps because they do not have manhole covers. (Pl.'s Dep. at 61:4-6). In her Declaration, Plaintiff clarified that although a magnetic manhole lifter could be used to lift metal lids of interior grease traps, Compliance Inspectors do not lift the lids. (Pl. Decl. ¶ 8). The parties, however, agree that Plaintiff did not present any pictures or specifications for magnetic manhole lifters or any other devices to anyone at DeKalb County. (DSMF ¶ 37).
Prior to the meeting, Plaintiff did not realize there were concerns about her ability to open interior grease traps. (Pl.'s Dep. at 78:11-14). The November 5, [*21]  2015 meeting was the first time DeTaboada raised concerns about the weight of the interior grease trap covers as well as the weight of Plaintiff's equipment. (PSMF ¶ 25). Plaintiff did not think the interior grease trap covers weighed enough to require an accommodation. (Pl. Dep. at 144:9-11). Plaintiff states that she suggested during the meeting that she could get a cart and a contact lifting device.6 (Pl.'s Dep. at 75:21-76:17, 124:3-8). After making that suggestion, Plaintiff recalls Angela Wester stating that they could discuss that later. (Pl. Dep. at 76:3-5). On the contrary, DeTaboada and Wester testified that Plaintiff did not describe any devices that would assist her with interior grease traps. (DeTaboada Dep. at 130:16-131:8, 135:11-17; Wester Dep. at 107:16-109:6).
The parties agree that Plaintiff asked to go back to her doctor to discuss what type of accommodations would work with the interior grease traps. (Wester Dep. at 89:11-14, 109:1-6; Pl.'s Dep. at 75:21-76:2; DeTaboada Dep. at 110:7-12). Plaintiff suggested that if DeTaboada had concerns about the interior grease traps, they could discuss those concerns with her doctor or the Job Accommodation Network. (Pl.'s Dep. [*22]  at 124:14-16). According to Plaintiff, Wester said they could do that later. (Pl.'s Dep. at 124:17-18). Lowery recalls that Plaintiff's requests to speak with her doctor and the Job Accommodation Network were denied, and one of the two people from DeKalb County said they could talk about things later and would get back to Plaintiff. (Lowery Decl. ¶¶ 2-3). Wester testified that Plaintiff intended to speak with her doctor about the interior grease traps and get back to them. (Wester Dep. at 108:9-109:6). Likewise, DeTaboada testified that after the meeting, she expected to hear back from Plaintiff about accommodations for the interior grease traps but never did. (DeTaboada Dep. at 120:16-21). Plaintiff and Lowery disagree, stating that no one at the meeting asked Plaintiff to provide additional information from her doctor. (Pl.'s Dep. at 125:15-17; Lowery Decl. ¶ 4). Plaintiff alleges she left the meeting with the impression that there would be another meeting where they would call the Job Accommodation Network or get feedback from her doctor. (Pl.'s Dep. at 124:22-125:14).
During the November 5, 2015 meeting, Plaintiff asked about other available jobs within DeKalb County and identified [*23]  the jobs posted on DeKalb County's website for which Plaintiff believed she was qualified. (DSMF ¶ 37; Pl.'s Dep. at 125:18-126:15). Wester called Ed Elder, the Employee Relations Manager in Human Resources, who stated that there were no other jobs available in DeKalb County that Plaintiff was qualified to do as an accommodation. (Wester Dep. at 97:3-13, Pl.'s Dep. at 124:7-11).

D. Termination
Plaintiff wrote a letter to Zachary Williams, the Chief Operating Officer, dated October 19, 2015, stating that she was desperate to return to work and had been released to work with the assistance of lifting devices. (Pl.'s Dep. at 119:19-120:5, Ex. 9). Plaintiff stated that her next step was to file a formal ADA complaint with the Department of Justice. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 9). The decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment was made by Scott Towler, the Director of the Department of Watershed Management, at the recommendation of Angela Wester, the Assistant Director of Administration. (Deposition of Scott Towler ("Towler Dep."), Doc. 53-1, at 22:10-13; Wester Decl. ¶ 7). Williams was not involved in the decision. (Wester Decl. ¶ 7). Prior to Plaintiff's termination, Wester had never seen the letter [*24]  Plaintiff wrote to Williams. (Wester Decl. ¶ 7). Towler did not recall seeing Plaintiff's letter to Williams prior to his deposition. (Towler Dep. at 17:11-19).
In a letter dated November 6, 2015,7 one day after the November 5, 2015 meeting, Towler notified Plaintiff of DeKalb County's intent to terminate her employment, effective November 17, 2015. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 10). The reason given for the termination was Plaintiff's "inability to perform the essential functions of your job even with reasonable accommodation." (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 10). The letter also informs Plaintiff that there were no vacant positions for which she was qualified subject to her physical limitations, states that Plaintiff did not offer any suggestions or reasonable accommodations to assist her with her job's essential duties during the November 5, 2015 meeting, and informs Plaintiff that she has a right to file a response to the proposed action within three business days of receiving the letter. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 10).
Plaintiff responded not to the Angela Lindsey, as directed by the letter, but directly to Towler. (Pl.'s Dep., Exs. 10-11). Plaintiff wrote that she requested a list of the essential job tasks and the [*25]  opportunity to review them with her doctor, but Wester told her to "wait until she discussed this meeting with her superiors and that I would receive a letter from the department and that I should proceed from there." (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 11). Plaintiff stated that she did not believe she was given the benefit of an interactive process. (Id.). Plaintiff then requested to be considered for eleven jobs posted on DeKalb County's website and asked for a formal extension of her medical leave to continue the interactive process, specifically requesting a list of essential job functions not covered by her initial accommodation request and a conference call with Human Resources and the Federal Job Accommodation Network. (Id.). Plaintiff did not describe how she could perform the essential functions of her job with any type of accommodation or specifically suggest any accommodation addressing the concerns about interior grease traps raised by DeTaboada in the November 5, 2015 meeting. (DSMF ¶¶ 44, 45). Plaintiff says she attempted to call Wester to see if they were going to schedule a follow-up meeting but did not get a call back. (Pl.'s Dep. at 128:4-10). DeKalb County fired Plaintiff on November [*26]  17, 2015. (PSMF ¶ 40).

LEGAL ANALYSIS

I. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears the initial responsibility of asserting the basis for its motion. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Apcoa, Inc. v. Fid. Nat'l Bank, 906 F.2d 610, 611 (11th Cir. 1990). The movant is not required, however, to negate its opponent's claim; the movant may discharge its burden by merely "'showing' — that is, pointing out to the district court — that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. After the movant has carried its burden, the non-moving party is then required to "go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence designating specific facts showing that there is a genuine disputed issue for trial; the non-moving party may meet its burden through affidavit and deposition testimony, answers to interrogatories, and the like. Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).
While the court is to view all evidence and factual inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n v. Norton, 324 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir. 2003), "the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; [*27]  the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact," Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (emphasis in original). A fact is material when it is identified as such by the controlling substantive law. Id. at 248. Moreover, the non-movant "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts . . . [w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citations omitted). An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50. Thus, the Federal Rules mandate the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of every element essential to that party's case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.

II. Discrimination

A. Prima Facie Case
The ADA bars employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability" regarding job application procedures; the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees; employee compensation; job training; and other terms, conditions, and privileges of [*28]  employment. Batson v. Salvation Army, 897 F.3d 1320, 1326 (11th Cir. 2018) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112). To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff must show that at the time of the adverse employment action, she (1) had a disability, (2) was a qualified individual, and (3) was subject to unlawful discrimination because of her disability. Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007). For purposes of summary judgment, Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff is disabled. (See Doc. 57-5, at 5) ("For the purposes of summary judgment, the County assumes [Plaintiff] was disabled.").

1. Qualified Individual
A qualified individual is "an individual who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Essential functions are "the fundamental job duties of the employment position," and not "the marginal functions." Samson v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 746 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1)). In this case, it is clear from the record, and the parties do not dispute, that being able to access interior grease traps was an essential function of Plaintiff's job as a Compliance Inspector for DeKalb County's Department of Watershed Management.8 (See Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 1). The dispute on summary judgment is twofold: whether Plaintiff's lifting restrictions [*29]  precluded her from accessing interior grease traps and, if so, whether Plaintiff's limitations could have been reasonably accommodated.9
On September 28, 2015, Dr. Weinberg released Plaintiff to return to work inclusive of all work duties with the accommodations of the truck-mounted jib crane, entry step to truck, and a magnetic manhole lifter. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 25). Dr. Weinberg's previous disability certification on September 16, 2015 suggested the same accommodations and included the related physical restriction that Plaintiff could not lift more than twenty pounds. (Weinberg Dep., Ex. 24; Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 24).10 Plaintiff admitted she could not lift more than twenty pounds when she was terminated in November 2015. (DSMF ¶ 25). Plaintiff relies upon her own testimony and a statement from another Compliance Inspector, Ryan Petty, as evidence that interior grease trap lids do not weigh more than twenty pounds and are not lifted but slid to the side to gain access. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 3; Pl.'s Dep. at 49:13-17, 144:9-11; Petty Decl ¶ 6).
Defendant objects to the portions of Plaintiff and Petty's declarations about the weight of the interior grease trap lids, arguing they are based on speculation [*30]  and not personal knowledge. (Doc. 72, at 11-13; Doc. 74). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(4) provides that "[a]n affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Lay witness testimony may be based on personal knowledge. Fed. R. Civ. P. 602. Further, a lay witness may only offer opinion testimony if it is: "(a) rationally based on the witness's perception; (b) helpful to clearly understanding the witness's testimony or to determining a fact in issue; and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702." Fed. R. Evid. 701. Although neither Plaintiff nor Petty purported to have weighed the interior grease trap covers, as Compliance Inspectors they had to move interior grease trap covers. The Court finds that Plaintiff and Petty's personal experience moving grease trap covers permits them to testify about the weight of interior grease trap covers. See United States v. Gold, 743 F.2d 800, 817 (11th Cir. 1984) (admitting lay witness's testimony about the percentage of sales being between twenty-five and forty percent because the testimony was based on first-hand knowledge and was "helpful [*31]  in resolving issues" critical to the case); Collar v. Austin, No. CV 14-0349-WS-B, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122609, 2015 WL 5444347, at *4 (S.D. Ala. Sept. 15, 2015), aff'd, 659 F. App'x 557 (11th Cir. 2016) ("It's commonly understood that lay witnesses may estimate size, weight, distance, speed and time even when those quantities could be measured precisely." (quoting Strong v. Valdez Fine Foods, 724 F.3d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir. 2013)).
On the other hand, DeTaboada and Bethea both contend that interior grease trap lids exceeded twenty pounds. (DeTaboada Dep. at 105:10-106:9; Bethea Decl. ¶ 7). DeTaboada, however, had not weighed any of the interior grease trap covers and based her opinion that very few grease trap covers weigh less than fifty pounds on manufacturers' specifications and industrial standards. (DeTaboada Dep. at 103:7-12, 105:10-106:9). Bethea, who supervised the FOG program, stated that he became a FOG Compliance Inspector in 2004 and is familiar about the procedures required for interior grease trap inspections. (Bethea Decl. ¶ 2). Bethea attached a document purporting to illustrate a "typical grease trap with specifications" as Exhibit 1, which is a list of grease trap interceptor parts, including thirteen different interceptor lids ranging from twenty pounds to one hundred fifty pounds. (Bethea Decl., Ex. 1). Bethea also purported to have gathered [*32]  data about interior grease traps "typical to those found throughout the county" from five restaurants in the South DeKalb mall. (Bethea Decl. ¶ 8). The grease trap covers in Bethea's sampling weighed between twenty and seventy pounds and required between fifteen and forty-three pounds of force to move. (Id. ¶¶ 9-16). Bethea also opined that two of the five restaurants had grease traps that, due to their location, would not permit the use of a lifting device. (Bethea Decl. ¶¶ 12, 13). Bethea did not state when he gathered the data, but Ryan Petty alleges Bethea took the photographs and measurements in December 2018. (Petty Decl. ¶ 4). Bethea's measurements undermine DeTaboada's statement that there are very few interior grease traps with covers that weigh less than fifty pounds, although none of the five covers Bethea measured weighed less than twenty pounds, as alleged by Plaintiff and Petty.
While the weight of the covers is a useful starting point, Plaintiff and Petty explained that Compliance Inspectors do not lift the covers up but slide them to the side. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 5, Petty Decl. ¶ 6; Pl.'s Dep. at 170:22-171:1, 215:23-24). Bethea only measured the force necessary to slide [*33]  three of the five covers, which required fifteen, twenty-two, and twenty-six pounds of force to slide. (Bethea Decl. ¶¶ 12, 13, 15). Plaintiff contends that all of Bethea's measurements are irrelevant because they were taken more than three years after Defendant decided to terminate Plaintiff. (Doc. 66 at 17). The Court finds Bethea's measurements fail to eliminate the factual dispute over the weight of the interior grease trap covers, as it is not clear that Bethea measured grease trap covers that were used in 2015. (Petty Decl. ¶ 4; Bethea Decl.). See Feldman v. Cutting, No. 09-14133-CIV, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108382, 2009 WL 4021364, at *5-6 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 19, 2009) (finding evidence that may have been outside the relevant fact period cannot be used to establish a genuine issue of material fact); Pacella v. Wachovia Corp., No. 1:08-CV-2717-ODE, 2009 WL 10664414, at *11 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 13, 2009) (holding that evidence outside the relevant time does not establish whether plaintiff met the definition of "disability" when her benefits were terminated). In addition, the Court notes that Bethea measured only five out of the approximately 300 grease traps that DeTaboada testified were in each Compliance Inspector's zone. (DeTaboada Dep. at 73:1).
The Court finds it to be a question of material fact as to whether Plaintiff could have tested the interior grease traps without an accommodation in November [*34]  2015. Both parties have presented their own evidence and provided a reason to discount the other party's evidence. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, reasonable jurors could find that Plaintiff was capable of inspecting interior grease traps without an accommodation in November 2015.
In the alternative, Plaintiff has presented evidence that she could have accessed interior grease traps with a magnetic manhole lifter or other lifting device. A doctor's opinion that an employee can return to work with accommodations is generally sufficient to create a dispute of material fact about an employee's ability to do her essential functions with reasonable accommodations. See Hill v. Clayton Cty. School Dist., 619 F. App'x 916, 920 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that the doctor's opinion that Plaintiff could perform her job with reasonable accommodation created a factual dispute sufficient to survive summary judgment). Here, however, Dr. Weinberg admitted that he has no knowledge about how a jib crane or magnetic manhole lifter could accommodate Plaintiff's disabilities. (Weinberg Dep. at 63:20-25). Thus, the Court finds it appropriate to discount Dr. Weinberg's opinion about the sufficiency of the proposed accommodations. See Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007) (holding [*35]  that a court does not have to accept as true evidence that is blatantly contradicted by the record on summary judgment); United States v. Davis, 809 F.2d 1509, 1513 (11th Cir. 1987) (holding that testimony can be so internally inconsistent and speculative as to have no probative value).
Nevertheless, the combined evidence in the record would permit a reasonable jury to find that Plaintiff could access interior grease traps with a reasonable accommodation in November of 2015. Plaintiff avers that a magnetic manhole lifter could be used to lift the covers of interior grease traps, although Plaintiff reiterates that Compliance Inspectors do not "lift" the interior covers. (Pl.'s Dec. ¶ 8). While Plaintiff and Petty claimed that Compliance Inspectors slide an interior grease trap cover rather than lift it, it can be easily inferred that a magnetic manhole lifter could be used to the same effect, namely to slightly lift and reposition the cover so that Plaintiff could insert the screwdriver and take measurements. Petty claims that the magnetic manhole lifters issued to Compliance Inspectors around 2017 could be used on interior grease traps. (Petty Decl. ¶ 7). While it is unknown whether the same magnetic manhole lifters were available to Plaintiff [*36]  in 2015, Petty's Declaration supports Plaintiff's general assertion that magnetic manhole lifters do not only open exterior grease interceptors but can be used on interior grease traps. DeTaboada, Plaintiff's supervisor, admitted that a magnetic manhole lifter could probably be used to gain access into interior grease traps, although she did not know whether Plaintiff would be able to transport it and whether it might require twisting and pushing. (DeTaboada Dep. at 126:3-129:25, Exs. 23-25). Plaintiff testified that her research found that there were magnetic lifters that weighed between six and twenty-two pounds, and that she identified hand-held magnetic lifters that weighed seventeen and thirteen pounds in 2015. (Pl.'s Dep. at 127:14-16, 239:24-240:1, 241:17-25).
Defendant points out that Plaintiff testified in her deposition that magnetic manhole lifters would not help on interior grease traps and would not be needed for interior traps because they do not have manhole covers. (Pl. Dep. at 61:4-10). While Defendant construes this as an admission that the proposed accommodation would not permit Plaintiff to access interior grease traps, on summary judgment, the Court must construe [*37]  the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiff and interpret Plaintiff's statement to mean that such a device was not needed to lift the cover of an interior grease trap. (See Doc. 72, at 5 n.3). Plaintiff also alleges she raised the possibility of using a contact lifting device during the November 5, 2015 meeting, although the record does not make it clear how this device functionally differs from a hand-held magnetic manhole lifter. (Pl. Dep. at 78:1-10 (describing a contact lifting device as "something that attaches to [sic] that if you can't pull, it can pull for you")). The Court finds that Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to create a question of fact whether she could have accessed interior grease traps with the assistance of a magnetic manhole lifter or other lifting device in November 2015.

2. Failure to Make Reasonable Accommodation
The ADA requires an employer to accommodate an employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would cause an undue hardship. Batson, 897 F.3d at 1326. A reasonable accommodation must enable to employee to perform the essential functions of the job. Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). Examples of reasonable accommodations include "acquisition or modification of equipment or devices" [*38]  and "reassignment to a vacant position." 42 U.S.C.A. § 12111(9)(B). The employee bears the burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of the job. Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255. The employee must make a specific demand in order to trigger the employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation. Hudson v. Tyson Farms, Inc., 769 F. App'x 911, 918 (11th Cir. 2019); Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999) (per curiam). An employer may need to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual to identify the person's limitations and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations. Spears v. Creel, 607 F. App'x 943, 948 (11th Cir. 2015). Plaintiff argues Defendant failed to make reasonable accommodations that would permit her to continue working as a Compliance Inspector and failed to transfer her to a vacant position for which she was qualified as a reasonable accommodation.

a. Compliance Inspector
Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to identify a reasonable accommodation that would permit her to access interior grease traps.11 (Doc. 57-5, at 14-19). Defendant points out that after almost ten months of disability certificates stating that Plaintiff was unable to work, Dr. Weinberg identified three accommodating devices in September 2015: the jib crane, truck entry step, and magnetic manhole lifter. (Id. at [*39]  14-15). During the November 5, 2015 meeting to explore possible accommodations, Plaintiff could not explain how any of the devices would allow her to access interior grease traps but only offered to discuss the issue with Dr. Weinberg or the Job Accommodation Network. (Id. at 16-17). According to Defendant, Plaintiff did not provide any details about the proposed accommodation of the magnetic manhole lifter, including its specifications, weight, pictures of the device, or explain how it could be used to remove interior grease traps. (Id. at 17). Nor did Plaintiff provide any new information in response to the termination letter about how the proposed accommodations would allow her to access interior grease traps. (Id. at 18). Defendant argues that it engaged in an "interactive process" by communicating with Plaintiff throughout the year, but Plaintiff only came forward to propose accommodations once her leave was about to expire. (Id. at 19-20). Defendant also argues that it participated in the interactive process by scheduling the November 5, 2015 meeting. (Id. at 20).
Plaintiff responds by contending that the Court must accept Dr. Weinberg's opinion that Plaintiff was cleared for [*40]  all work duties with the accommodations, including a magnetic manhole lifter, as true on summary judgment. (Id. at 20). Plaintiff points out that DeTaboada admitted in her deposition that a hand-held magnetic manhole lifter would "probably" allow Plaintiff to access interior grease traps. (Doc. 66, at 21). Plaintiff contends that DeTaboada's failure to investigate the requested accommodation does not give rise to an obligation on the part of Plaintiff to identify additional accommodations. (Id. at 22-23). Further, Plaintiff argues that the parties' differing versions of the November 5, 2015 meeting creates a dispute of material fact. (Id. at 23-24). Plaintiff claims she was unaware that DeTaboada was concerned about her ability to access interior grease traps prior to the meeting, but when she requested to consult with Dr. Weinberg or the Job Accommodation Network, Wester shut down the meeting and said she would get back to Plaintiff, which never happened. (Id. at 23-24). According to Plaintiff, Defendant then sent her a notice of intent to terminate, effectively shutting down the interactive process. (Id. at 24).
Defendant replies that Dr. Weinberg found Plaintiff totally disabled [*41]  for ten months leading up to September 16, 2015, including stating that Plaintiff was unable to work on September 15, 2015. (Def.'s Reply Br., Doc. 72, at 4-5). In support, Defendant points to Dr. Weinberg's lack of knowledge about the recommended accommodations. (Id. at 8-9). Neither Wester nor DeTaboada understood how devices for exterior manholes would allow Plaintiff to perform inspections on interior grease traps. (Id. at 5). At the meeting on November 5, 2105, Defendant sought clarification from Plaintiff, but Plaintiff provided no explanation. (Id. at 6-7). Defendant argues the picture of a magnetic lifter, shown to DeTaboada during her deposition, is irrelevant because Plaintiff never presented or described it to Defendant in 2015, and it was Plaintiff's burden to describe how the accommodations would allow her to perform essential job functions. (Id. at 7-8, 14). Defendant reiterates its argument that it was engaged in the interactive process with Plaintiff when it approved additional leave beyond FMLA, informed her she needed to be released by her physician to work, searched for other jobs, and met with her on November 5, 2015. (Id. at 10-11).
An employer's duty to provide [*42]  a reasonable accommodation is triggered by the employee making a specific demand for an accommodation. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016), cert denied, 137 S. Ct. 592 (2016). The Eleventh Circuit has not "determined precisely what form a request for accommodation must take." Adigun v. Express Scripts, Inc., 742 F. App'x 474, 476 (11th Cir. 2018) (quoting Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1261 n. 14 (11th Cir. 2007)). Following the Tenth and Third Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit in Adigun recently held that an FMLA form referring the plaintiff for cardiac rehabilitation did not provide "enough information about her . . . limitations and desires" to trigger the employer's duty to accommodate her. Id. a 477. Here, in contrast, Plaintiff's September 16, 2018 disability form indicated a limitation on lifting no more than twenty pounds and suggested three specific accommodations. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 24). The September 28, 2015 disability form also released Plaintiff to work with those three accommodations. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 25). Plaintiff tried to come back to work in September, delivering at least one disability certificate to DeTaboada in person. (Pl.'s Dep. at 115:24-117:2). Plaintiff, by providing Defendant with Dr. Weinberg's September 16 and September 28, 2015 disability certificates, identified three specific accommodations: a jib crane, a step for her truck, and a magnetic manhole [*43]  lifter. See E.E.O.C. v. Eckerd Corp., No. 1:10-cv-2816-JEC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91370, 2012 WL 2726766, at *3, 6 (N.D. Ga. July 9, 2012) (holding that a plaintiff can identify an accommodation by presenting a physician's note).
As discussed above, there is a material factual dispute about whether a magnetic manhole lifter would have permitted Plaintiff to access interior grease traps. DeTaboada, who Wester relied on to advise whether the proposed accommodations were adequate, believed the proposed magnetic manhole lifter was attached to a truck, although that was not stated in Dr. Weinberg's disability certificate. (DeTaboada Dep. at 85:14-25, Ex. 13). DeTaboada did not research hand-held magnetic manhole lifters but assumed one could not fit into limited spaces. (DeTaboada Dep. at 91:7-14, 95:3-8). Thus, DeTaboada sought information during the November 5, 2015 meeting about accommodations for accessing interior grease traps.
Plaintiff did not anticipate discussing accommodations for interior grease traps on November 5, 2015, as she was not aware Defendant perceived them to be an issue. (Pl.'s Dep. at 78:11-14; PSMF ¶ 25). Plaintiff claims to have suggested a contact lifting device during the meeting, although DeTaboada and Wester disagree and state that Plaintiff [*44]  never suggested any accommodation for interior grease traps. (Pl.'s Dep. at 75:21-76:17, 124:3-8; DeTaboada Dep. at 130:16-131:8, 135:11-17; Wester Dep. at 107:16-109:6). Plaintiff asked to discuss DeTaboada's concerns about interior grease traps with Dr. Weinberg and the Job Accommodation Network. (Pl.'s Dep. at 124:12-16). The parties disagree whether Wester said they would do that later or whether Plaintiff was going to consult with Dr. Weinberg and the Job Accommodation Network and report back to Defendant. (Pl.'s Dep. at 124:17-18, 125:15-17; Lowery Decl. ¶¶ 2-4; Wester Dep. at 108:9-109:6; DeTaboada Dep. at 120:16-21). Plaintiff claims to have left the meeting with the impression that there would be another meeting where Defendant would call the Job Accommodation Network and Dr. Weinberg. (Pl.'s Dep. at 124:22-125:14). Regardless, Defendant sent Plaintiff a notice of proposed termination the very next day, precluding the opportunity to gather additional information about interior grease trap accommodations.
Viewed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, the evidence appears to suggest that Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process in good faith.12 Once Plaintiff requested [*45]  a reasonable accommodation, Defendant had "an obligation to engage in an interactive process with Plaintiff to determine whether and which reasonable accommodations are feasible . . ." Robinson v. RockTenn, CP, LLC, 986 F. Supp.2d 1287, 1309 n.22 (N.D. Ala. 2013); see also Taylor v. Principal Fin. Grp., Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996) ("In other words, once an accommodation is properly requested, the responsibility for fashioning a reasonable accommodation is shared between the employee and employer."); Crutcher v. Mobile Hous. Bd., No. CIV.A. 04-0499-WS-M, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35402, 2005 WL 2675207, at *12 (S.D. Ala. Oct. 20, 2005) ("The appropriate accommodation is best determined through a flexible, interactive process that involves both the employer and the [employee] with a disability."). "The interactive process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3).
Defendant's conduct could be viewed as a lack of seriousness about determining whether Plaintiff's lifting limitations could be reasonably accommodated. After Plaintiff proposed a magnetic manhole lifter as a reasonable accommodation, DeTaboada assumed it had to be mounted on a truck and did not research whether a magnetic manhole lifter would make it possible for Plaintiff to access all or most of the interior grease traps. (DeTaboada Dep. [*46]  at 69:1-11, 85:14-20, 86:10-15, 91:7-92:13). Plaintiff claims she asked during the November 5, 2015 meeting to obtain additional information from Dr. Weinberg and the Job Accommodation Network and identified a contact lifting device as another possible accommodation. (Pl.'s Dep. at 75:21-76:17, 124:3-8, 14-16). After meeting with Plaintiff on November 5, 2015, and for the first time explaining DeTaboada's concern about interior grease traps, Defendant sent the pre-termination letter to Plaintiff the very next day. (Wester Dep., Ex. 16). On receipt of the pre-termination letter and being given three days to respond, Plaintiff asked for a formal extension of her medical leave to continue the interactive process, specifically requesting a list of essential job functions not covered by her initial accommodation request and a conference call with Human Resources and the Federal Job Accommodation Network. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 10, 11). The guidance accompanying the ADA regulations state that the employer "may find that technical assistance is helpful" and could seek such assistance from the Commission, State or local rehabilitation agencies, or disability constituent organizations. 29 C.F.R. 1630.9 App'x. Plaintiff [*47]  also testified that she attempted to call Wester to see if they were going to schedule a follow-up meeting but did not receive a return call. (Pl.'s Dep. at 128:4-10).
While Defendant graciously provided Plaintiff with extended medical leave, a jury could reasonably find that Defendant caused the interactive process to break down at the point Plaintiff requested reasonable accommodations. See Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996) (explaining that "courts should look for signs of failure to participate in good faith or failure by one of the parties to make reasonable efforts to help the other party determine what specific accommodations are necessary"); cf. E.E.O.C. v. Eckerd Corp., No. 1:10-cv-2816-JEC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91370, 2012 WL 2726766, at *3, 8 (N.D. Ga. July 9, 2010) (finding that the employer met its burden by gathering information from various sources about how the employee's physical limitations affected her work, including seeking information from the employee's doctor about reasonable accommodations, and meeting with the employee several times); Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997) (finding that employer engaged in the interactive process by offering accommodations that the employee failed to show were unreasonable).

b. Other Positions
The ADA requires employers to provide disabled employees with alternative employment [*48]  opportunities reasonably available under existing policies. Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 627 (11th Cir. 1998). Reassignment is only required if there is a vacant position available for which Plaintiff is otherwise qualified. Willis v. Conopco, 108 F.3d 282, 284 (11th Cir. 1997). A plaintiff must show that she requested assignment to a specific position. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2016). In this case, Plaintiff identified approximately eleven or twelve other positions advertised on DeKalb County's website that she believed she could do as a reasonable accommodation. (Pl.'s Dep. at 128:24-129:1, 129:3, 131:22-24, 134:5-135:2). Plaintiff presented these alternative positions at the November 5, 2018 meeting and again in her written response to Towler's pre-termination letter. (Pl.'s Dep. at 125:18-25, Exs. 11, 32).
Plaintiff testified that she read the job descriptions and believed herself to be qualified for the positions. (Pl.'s Dep. at 129:18-20; 132:7). Attached as Exhibit 53 to Plaintiff's deposition are job descriptions that Plaintiff testified she printed at an unknown time, probably a few years prior to her 2018 deposition.13 (Pl.'s Dep. at 246:21-247:12, Ex. 53). Exhibit 53 contains job descriptions for ten of the eleven positions that Plaintiff requested as an accommodation, and the documents state that the positions [*49]  were available in late 2015. (Pl.'s Dep., Exs. 11, 32, 53). Defendant does not contest the authenticity of the job descriptions and, although they were not properly authenticated during her deposition, it appears that they could be properly authenticated by Plaintiff at trial. See U.S. for Use & Ben. of WFI Georgia, Inc., v. Gray Ins. Co., 701 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1332 (N.D. Ga. 2010), aff'd sub nom. U.S. ex rel. Capital Computer Grp., LLC v. Gray Ins. Co., 453 F. App'x 905 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that a court may consider unauthenticated evidence could likely be authenticated at trial).
Richwagen, the Deputy Director of Human Resources, averred that DeKalb County has a process by which it can place employees with limitations in available jobs. (Richwagen Decl. ¶ 3). Human Resources considered the positions identified by Plaintiff in November, but Plaintiff was not hired for those positions for various reasons, including: Plaintiff did not have the required educational degree or experience, the job's physical requirements exceeded those described by her physician, and/or the jobs were already filled or withdrawn. (Richwagen Decl. ¶ 8). Specifically, Richwagen states that the Cross Connect Control Specialist position had not been available since 2011 and required lifting up to 51 pounds or more. (Richwagen Decl. ¶¶ 9, 10). The Utility Billing Analyst position was filled prior [*50]  to Plaintiff seeking reassignment. (Richwagen Decl. ¶ 11). The Utility Collections Analyst position was filled by someone with twenty-one years of experience in the department. (Richwagen Decl. ¶ 1). The ADA does not require noncompetitive reassignment, or preferential treatment, of disabled employees. U.S. Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n v. St. Joseph's Hospital, Inc., 842 F.3d 1333, 1345 (11th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff does not contradict Richwagen's testimony about those three positions.
Even eliminating the three positions specifically addressed by Richwagen, there are still eight positions advertised on DeKalb County's website that Plaintiff claims she was qualified to do: GIS Specialist III, Engineering Review Officer III, Field Service Manager, Road and Drainage Operations Manager, Utility Collection Specialist, Wastewater Laboratory Technician, Stormwater Engineering Supervisor, and System Analyst. (Pl.'s Dep. at 129:18-20; 132:7, Ex. 53). Plaintiff, however, testified that she did not have the required experience in mapping or geographic information systems for the GIS Specialist III position and could not identify any related field in which she had experience. (Pl.'s Dep. at 250:16-252:7). Plaintiff also admitted that the Field Service Manager, Engineer Review Officer, and Road and [*51]  Drainage Operations Manager positions would promote her to a management position, and the ADA does not require an employer to promote an employee to accommodate him or her. (Pl.'s Dep. at 252:20-22, 254:7-9, 255:7-10). Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir. 2001). Although Exhibit 53 does not contain the qualifications for the Stormwater Engineering Supervisor position, the description makes it clear that it is also a management position. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 53). Plaintiff argues she met the eligibility requirements for the available positions as a Wastewater Laboratory Technician, although she did not have experience doing that job. (Pl.'s Dep. at 257:6-7). Plaintiff also contends that she was qualified to work as a Utility Collections Specialist but did not approach anyone about getting the job. (Pl.'s Dep. at 258:15-19). Plaintiff also alleges she met the qualifications for the Systems Analyst position. (Pl.'s Dep. at 262:5-16).
This Court finds Plaintiff has met her prima facie burden of showing that she is a qualified individual capable of performing the essential functions of a Wastewater Laboratory Technician, Utility Collections Specialist, and Systems Analyst by providing the job descriptions and alleging that she at least [*52]  met the minimum qualifications. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) ("[I]f an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job."). Defendant only provided a general list of reasons why Plaintiff did not receive any of the jobs she requested but failed to provide any specific rationale for any of these three positions. (Richwagen Decl. ¶ 8). See Duckett, 120 F.3d 1222, 1222 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that the determination of whether an employee is qualified individual must be determined by reference to a specific position) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m))); Pearson v. Augusta, Ga., 243 F. Supp. 3d 1344, 1362 (S.D. Ga. 2017) (finding that a conclusory statement unsupported by evidence to be insufficient to show whether a plaintiff met job qualifications). Thus, the Court finds there to be a question of material fact whether Plaintiff could have been reasonably accommodated by a transfer to one of the following positions: Wastewater Laboratory Technician, Utility Collections Specialist, and the Systems Analyst position. Accordingly, this Court RECOMENDS that Defendant's for Summary Judgment be DENIED as to Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim.

3. Direct Evidence of Discrimination
Plaintiff contends that DeTaboada's [*53]  comment that Plaintiff could not return to work until she was 100% healed constitutes direct evidence of discrimination. (Doc. 66, at 14-16). Defendant responds that Plaintiff never accused DeTaboada of saying Plaintiff had to be "100% healed," only "100%." (Doc. 72, at 2). Defendant contends that even if the "100%" comment was made, it is not indicative of a policy that precludes reasonable accommodations, as "100%" could mean that Plaintiff could not return until she was able to perform 100% of the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 72, at 2). Further, Defendant argues DeTaboada was not the decisionmaker with respect to placing Plaintiff on leave, allowing her to return to work, or providing accommodations. (Doc. 72, at 2).
Plaintiff alleges DeTaboada told her she had to be "a hundred percent" in December and January. (Pl.'s Dep. at 68:22-24, 147:18-25). When asked during her deposition to confirm that allegation, Plaintiff explained that DeTaboada asked her "what percent are you" from the first time she talked to her. (Pl.'s Dep. at 147:18-25). Plaintiff never asked DeTaboada what she meant by a hundred percent. (Pl.'s Dep. at 81:19-20). [*54]  Plaintiff alleges DeTaboada told her that she needed to be "perfect" in the November 5, 2015 meeting. (Pl.'s Dep. at 81:23-24). Plaintiff interpreted that to mean "in complete good health," but did not know if she asked DeTaboada what "perfect" meant. (Pl.'s Dep. at 82:9-10). Plaintiff claims to have undergone treatment she would not have but for trying to be a hundred percent. (Pl.'s Dep. at 155:22-156:2). Plaintiff admits she was aware by April or May that she could get her job back if she could do it with reasonable accommodations. (Pl.'s Dep. at 83:16-20). Plaintiff wrote in her August 15, 2015 letter to Williams, the Chief Operating Officer, that she was "told I must be a hundred percent in order to return to work." (Pl.'s Dep. at 110:20-111:2, Ex. 7).
The Court agrees that a policy requiring employees to be "100% healed" before returning to work would constitute direct evidence of discrimination. Such a policy would discriminate against disabled individuals and substitute a "100% healed" standard for the ADA's standard of a qualified individual able to perform the essential functions with or without accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b); McGregor v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 187 F.3d 1113, 1116 (9th Cir. 1999). Here, however, Plaintiff has not presented evidence that [*55]  Defendant had such a policy. In employment discrimination cases, courts have found direct evidence of discrimination to be "only the most blatant remarks, whose intent could be nothing other than to discriminate . . ." Rojas v. Florida, 285 F.3d 1339, 1342 n.2 (11th Cir. 2002). Direct evidence must establish the existence of discriminatory intent without any inference or presumption. Kirkpatrick v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 268 F. App'x 860, 861-62 (11th Cir. 2008); Standard v. A.B.E.L. Services, Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir. 2001).
Under the facts of this case, the Court is asked to make an inferential leap from DeTaboada, Plaintiff's supervisor, asking Plaintiff what percentage recovered she was and whether she was perfect to Defendant not permitting Plaintiff to return to work unless she was "100% healed." While DeTaboada denies ever making such a statement, Defendant argues DeTaboada could have been asking whether Plaintiff was 100% capable of performing her essential duties, which would reflect the requirements of the ADA. (Doc. 72, at 2). It is readily apparent to this Court that DeTaboada's alleged statement is subject to different meanings. Evidence subject to more than one interpretation is not direct evidence. See Roberts v. Design & Mfg. Servs., Inc., 167 F. App'x 82, 84-85 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding that the company president's statements that an employee "was getting too old for this stuff" after suffering a concussion, "needed to spend more time with [*56]  his family," and frequent inquiries about his plans for retirement did not constitute direct evidence of age discrimination); Moore v. Jackson Cty. Bd. of Educ., 979 F. Supp.2d 1251, 1266 (N.D. Ala. 2013) (holding that a policy requiring the employee to be able to perform all her job duties is permissible under the Rehabilitation Act).
Further, statements cited as direct evidence of discrimination must be made by a person involved in the challenged decision. Bass v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1105 (11th Cir. 2001). Wester averred that she evaluated Plaintiff's requests to return to work and requests for accommodations and made recommendations to the Director of Watershed Management. (Wester Decl. ¶ 6). DeTaboada's only role was consulting with Wester about whether the proposed accommodations would have allowed Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of a Compliance Inspector. (PSMF ¶ 16; Wester Dep. at 121:18-23, 122:10-13). DeTaboada's role contradicts the existence of a "100% healed" policy. Accordingly, the Court finds that DeTaboada's alleged statements are more appropriately considered as circumstantial evidence instead of direct evidence of intent to discriminate.

4. Termination
An employer who fires a qualified employee with a disability violates the ADA if the employer would not have fired the employee [*57]  "but for" her disability. Jones v. Aaron's, Inc., 748 F. App'x 907, 914 (11th Cir. 2018). In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, a claim for discriminatory termination under the ADA follows the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Jones, F. App'x 907, 914 (11th Cir. 2018). Once Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, Defendant must assert a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff. Id. at 14-15. If Defendant does so, Plaintiff must then show that Defendant's reason was pretext and the real reason was her disability. Id. at 15.
Defendant seeks summary judgment on Plaintiff's discrimination claim based on her termination, only asserting that Plaintiff failed to show that she was a qualified individual with a disability. (Doc. 57-5, at 23). Because the Court has already determined that whether Plaintiff was a qualified individual is a material fact in dispute, the case is not due to be dismissed on that basis. Accordingly, the Court RECOMENDS that Defendant's for Summary Judgment be DENIED as to Plaintiff's discriminatory termination claim.

III. Retaliation
The ADA prohibits retaliation against an individual for opposing an unlawful practice or making a charge under the ADA. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff alleges she was fired because she requested [*58]  a reasonable accommodation and sent a letter to Williams, the Chief Operating Officer, dated October 20, 2015, informing him of her intent to file an ADA complaint. (Compl. ¶ 105).
Defendant contends that Plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodation should not be considered a protected expression because Defendant was already aware of Plaintiff's disability. (Doc. 57-5, at 24-25). As to Plaintiff's October 20, 2015 letter to Williams, Defendant argues Plaintiff failed to show that a decisionmaker was aware of it. (Doc. 57-5, at 25). Finally, Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to show a causal relationship between protected expression and her termination. (Doc. 57-5, at 25). Defendant notes that Plaintiff requested additional leave without any consequence, but it was only after Plaintiff's leave expired and she was subject to termination that she requested reasonable accommodations. (Doc. 57-5, at 25-26). Citing Frazier-White, Defendant asserts that the timing of the request negates causation. (Doc. 57-5, at 25). Defendant argues Plaintiff has not demonstrated that its non-discriminatory reason for terminating her — because she could not perform her essential duties with or [*59]  without accommodation — is pretextual. (Doc. 57-5, at 26-28).
Plaintiff responds that Defendant cites no authority for its argument that her request for reasonable accommodation was not protected expression because it was a continuation of previous requests. (Doc. 66, at 29). Plaintiff argues Frazier-White is distinguishable because the plaintiff in that case failed to identify any reasonable accommodations. (Doc. 66, at 29). Further, Plaintiff contends that she sent a letter alleging ADA violations to Towler, a decisionmaker, on November 12, 2015, five days before being fired. (Doc. 66, at 30). Defendant argues in response that Plaintiff has not shown that she would not have been terminated "but for" her protected expression. (Doc. 72, at 16-17). In support, Defendant notes that it had already informed Plaintiff that she had to return to work with appropriate medical documentation by September 21, 2015; thus, it had already decided to initiate termination proceedings if Plaintiff did not meet that condition. (Id.).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she engaged in statutorily protected expression by opposing an unlawful practice, (2) she suffered [*60]  an adverse employment action when she was terminated, and (3) there is a causal link between the expression and the termination. Jones v. Aaron's Inc., 748 F. App'x 907, 916 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258). The third element requires a showing of "but-for" causation. Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258. Here, Plaintiff's retaliation claim falls short on the third element of the prima facie case. At the time Plaintiff says she engaged in protected activity — identifying reasonable accommodations on September 16, 2015, and sending a letter to Towler dated November 12, 201514 — Defendant had already given Plaintiff a deadline to return to work. Defendant's letter dated August 20, 2015 required Plaintiff to return to work on September 21, 2015, with appropriate medical documentation showing that she could do her job with or without a reasonable accommodation. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 8). A reasonable jury could not find that Plaintiff would not have been terminated "but for" her alleged protected expression solicited in Defendant's letter. Indeed, it is almost certain that Plaintiff would have been terminated, likely earlier, if she had not informed Defendant that she could return to work with accommodations before the September 21, 2015 deadline to return to work. Also, by the time Plaintiff complained [*61]  to Towler about not being accommodated, she had already been given notice of her November 17, 2015 termination. (Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 10). See Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016) (holding that a plaintiff failed to show but-for causation where she requested an accommodation after being advised that a hearing panel recommended her dismissal).
The root of the parties' disagreement is that Plaintiff believes she met Defendant's deadline by demonstrating an ability to do the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation, and Defendant does not. In this way, Plaintiff's retaliation claim is duplicative of her reasonable accommodation claim. Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1261 (11th Cir. 2001) (holding that an employee's claim that his employer took adverse action against her by failing to reasonably accommodate him merely reclothes his discrimination claim); Jernigan v. Bellsouth Telecomms., LLC, 17 F. Supp. 3d 1317, 1326 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (dismissing an employee's retaliation claim as a reclothed version of his discrimination claim where there was no evidence suggesting that the employee was fired for any reason than the employer's belief that the employee could not do the essential functions of the job). Therefore, this Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

CONCLUSION
For [*62]  the reasons discussed above, this Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART (Doc. 57). As this is a final Report and Recommendation and there are no other matters pending before this Court, the Clerk is directed to terminate the reference to the undersigned.
SO REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED, this 17 day of July, 2019.
