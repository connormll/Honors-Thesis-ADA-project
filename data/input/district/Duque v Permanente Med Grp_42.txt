ORDER RE MOTION TO DISMISS
Re: Dkt. No. 13
Pro se plaintiff Martha Duque has sued her former employer, The Permanente Medical Group, Inc. ("TPMG"), for discrimination on the basis of disability, and retaliatory termination. Dkt. No. 7 ("SAC"). In a second amended complaint, Duque alleges that she became disabled through workplace injuries, and that her termination violated the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12113, and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12940. Id. TPMG moves to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Dkt. No. 13.
In light of the liberal construction of pleadings afforded to pro se litigants, the SAC provides enough facts to plausibly allege the ADA and FEHA claims and for the case to go forward. There is no doubt that the parties disagree about the facts and whether Duque was terminated and retaliated against for her disability issues. The role of the third-party claims administrator is [*2]  also a major point of disagreement. But these fact issues will need to be resolved at the proper procedural stage, namely summary judgment or trial. The only issue here is the adequacy of the allegations in the SAC.
In this order on a pleadings motion, the Court has provided more than the typical guidance on the case and the factual disputes. The Court's hope is that this guidance will help the parties focus their disagreements with an eye toward mediation or settlement.

BACKGROUND
As alleged in the SAC, Duque was hired by TPMG in August 2007 as a lab assistant. Dkt. No. 7 ¶ 11. In May 2014, she began to experience pain and numbness in her left shoulder and arm from repetitive stress injuries. Id. ¶ 12. She went on medical leave for approximately three months and returned to work in August 2014. Id. ¶ 14. Duque sought worker's compensation for these injuries but Athens Administrators ("Athens"), TPMG's insurer and claims administrator, denied her claim. Based on evaluations and recommendations from TPMG occupational health physicians, Duque sought orthopedic treatment, but this request was denied as well. See id. ¶¶ 13-19.
On June 29, 2015, Duque had a slip-and-fall accident at work, sustaining [*3]  multiple injuries. Id. ¶ 20. She went on medical leave again until September 2015 and sought approval for treatment, including MRIs and medication, but her requests were again denied. Headaches, dizziness and pain in her back, neck, shoulder, chest, and left arm and hand led her to take intermittent sick days. Id. ¶ 21. On December 14, 2015, Duque became "very sick and couldn't work," and a month later a doctor placed her on medical leave because she could not perform her job functions. Id. ¶¶ 22-23.
From late 2016 through early 2017, Duque updated TPMG with near-monthly "work excuse" notes from her doctor. Id. ¶¶ 39-47. In late March or early April 2017, Duque received an MRI of her neck and shoulder. Id. ¶¶ 49-50. On April 10, 2017, Duque's doctor issued a worker's compensation "progress report" with the MRI results and requested orthopedic consultations. Id.
The SAC mentions court proceedings, which appear to have been part of Duque's efforts to receive worker's compensation for injuries stemming from the June 2015 fall. Id. ¶¶ 27-37. She was at least partially successful -- Athens finally accepted "liability" in a September 2016 letter, id. ¶ 38 -- but disputes continued through [*4]  2017. Id. ¶¶ 41, 44, 52.
In July 2017, Duque requested extensions of her medical leave from TPMG to get the orthopedic evaluation recommended by her physician. Id. ¶¶ 52-54. Duque said that she "couldn't return to work at the moment with or without restrictions" while she was waiting to be evaluated. Id. ¶ 54. On August 25, a TPMG human resources representative responded that Duque's request for a medical leave extension was "unreasonable," and that she would be "separate[ed] from employment" effective August 30, 2017. Id. ¶ 59. Duque was subsequently terminated. Id. ¶ 60. Duque alleges that her allotted two-year leave of absence did not expire until December 14, 2017. Id. ¶¶ 8, 10.

LEGAL STANDARDS
To satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) and Rule 12(b)(6), a claim must provide "a short and plain statement . . . showing that the pleader is entitled to relief," Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), including "enough facts to state a claim . . . that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). A claim is plausible on its face if, accepting all factual allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court can reasonably infer that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). The Court will not treat as [*5]  fact or accept as true allegations that are bare legal conclusions, recitations of elements or unwarranted deductions. Id. The plausibility analysis is "context-specific" and not only invites but "requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Id. at 679. Review is limited to the contents of the complaint. Clegg v. Cult Awareness Network, 18 F.3d 752, 754 (9th Cir. 1994).
In addition to these well-established standards, the Court liberally construes Duque's pleadings as a pro se plaintiff. Hebbe v. Pliler, 627 F.3d 338, 342 (9th Cir. 2010).

DISCUSSION

I. THE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS
Duque's first and third claims are for discrimination under the ADA and FEHA. Dkt. No. 7. The ADA prohibits an employer from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Discrimination includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of [the employer]." Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To state a prima facie discrimination claim under the ADA, Duque must plausibly allege: "(1) that she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) that she is a qualified individual [*6]  with a disability; and (3) that she was discriminated against because of her disability." Smith v. Clark Cty. Sch. Dist., 727 F.3d 950, 955 (9th Cir. 2013).
The FEHA likewise prohibits employers from discriminating against employees because of a physical disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). The FEHA, like the ADA, requires that "(1) plaintiff suffers from a disability; (2) plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 254, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (Ct. App. 2000). "Because the FEHA provisions relating to disability discrimination are based on the ADA, decisions interpreting federal anti-discrimination laws are relevant in interpreting the FEHA's similar provisions." Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1133 n.6 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (Ct. App. 1997).
The SAC adequately alleges that Duque was physically disabled within the meaning of the ADA and that she suffered an adverse employment action. TPMG's main argument for dismissal is that Duque did not plausibly allege that she was a "qualified individual with a disability" who could perform the essential functions of her job. Dkt. No. 13 at 3, 7-8.
The point is not well taken. A qualified individual with a disability is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual [*7]  holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 999 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (applying "qualified individual" analysis under ADA to FEHA) (citing Green v. California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 262, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007)). The SAC alleges facts indicating that, except for her ailments at the time of her termination, Duque was qualified for the position of lab assistant. Among other facts, Duque says that she began working as a lab assistant in 2007, was promoted in that position, and could have kept that job if she had been afforded the time to recover from her injuries. See Dkt. No. 7 ¶¶ 7, 11. That is enough as a pleading matter to plausibly state she was a qualified individual. Hason v. Med. Bd. of Cal., 279 F.3d 1167, 1173 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 1999) (unpaid medical leave may be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA).
TPMG's heavy emphasis on statements by Duque expressing worry about her ability to handle the job at the time of termination, Dkt. No. 13 at 8, are misplaced. These statements were made in the context of Duque's request for additional medical leave, and do not render her unqualified as a matter of law. See, e.g., Nunes, 164 F.3d at 1247. The fact that Duque could not commit to an exact date by which she could return in good health is also not a basis to dismiss at the pleading stage. Duque alleges that she was entitled to four more months of medical leave [*8]  under an "industrial leave practice and union bargaining agreement," and could have given TPMG a more precise estimate of her return date following an orthopedic evaluation. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 7 ¶¶ 7, 10, 55; Dkt. No. 16 at 2.
Duque also plausibly alleges discrimination "because of" her disability. She says that TPMG denied her accommodation request as "unreasonable" and terminated her employment in the same letter. TPMG's main attack on this point is that it had no obligation to extend Duque's medical leave any further. Dkt. No. 13 at 8. But whether an extension was properly denied because it would have imposed an undue hardship on TPMG is a question best evaluated at the summary judgment stage or at trial. See U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-02 (2002) (laying out multi-step burden shifting analysis to determine what potential accommodations are reasonable and which rise to the level of an undue hardship at the summary judgment stage); Nunes, 164 F.3d at 1247 ("Determining whether a proposed accommodation (medical leave in this case) is reasonable, including whether it imposes an undue hardship on the employer, requires a fact-specific, individualized inquiry.").

II. THE RETALIATION CLAIMS
Duque's second and fourth claims under the ADA and FEHA [*9]  are for retaliation. Dkt. No. 7. "No person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge" under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). To state a retaliation claim under the ADA, Duque must plausibly allege: "(1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link between the two." Alvarado v. Cajun Operating Co., 588 F.3d 1261, 1269 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Coons v. Sec'y of U.S. Dept. of Treasury, 383 F.3d 879, 887 (9th Cir. 2004)). A failure to accommodate claim and an unlawful discharge claim are often "from a practical standpoint, the same," because "the consequence of the failure to accommodate is . . . frequently an unlawful termination." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139.
The FEHA similarly makes it unlawful for an employer "to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has . . . filed a complaint" under the act. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). Like the ADA, a prima facie retaliation claim under the FEHA requires a plaintiff to plead: "(1) he or she engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005).
TPMG's effort to say that Duque was not engaged in a protected [*10]  activity at the time she was fired is unpersuasive. Duque alleges that her termination was in response to an accommodation request (additional medical leave) and to a contentious injury compensation claim process. This is enough. See Coons, 383 F.3d at 887. Duque also sufficiently alleges a causal link between her termination and these two acts: both her denial of additional leave as "unreasonable" and termination were announced in the same letter. TPMG's factual disputes and challenges as to the legitimate, nonretaliatory reasons for termination may be appropriately raised on a motion for summary judgment or at trial. Consequently, Duque's retaliation claims will go forward as well.

CONCLUSION
The motion is denied. The Court will issue a scheduling order.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
