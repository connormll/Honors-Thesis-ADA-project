Opinion



ORDER
Before the Court is Defendants', Management & Training Corporation and East Mississippi Correctional Facility, Motion for Summary Judgment, Docket No. 31. The Defendants support the motion with exhibits, Docket Nos. 32-1 to 32-23; memorandum of law, Docket No. 32; and rebuttal, Docket No. 39. Plaintiff Audrey Helen Hart opposes the motion with her response, Docket No. 36; and memorandum of law, Docket No. 37. After careful consideration of the parties' submissions and the applicable law, the Court finds that Defendants' summary judgment motion is granted in part and denied in part.

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff, Audrey Helen Hart, is a former correctional officer for East Mississippi Correction Facility ("EMCF"), which is operated by Management & Training Corporation ("MTC"). After transferring to EMCF in 2011, Hart began [*2]  working as a Facility Day Shift Lieutenant on July 19, 2012. Docket No. 36-1, at 1. She interviewed for a vacant Captain position on September 6, 2012. Docket No. 1, at 2. Fredwrick Young, who was also a Lieutenant, interviewed for the position as well. Docket No. 32-1, at 2. Young had previously served as Chief of Security (a position ranked higher than Captain) for the company responsible for operating EMCF prior to MTC assuming that role. See id. Deputy Warden Federico Ovalle and Chief of Security, Major Derrick Smith, conducted the interviews. Id. In their post interview evaluations, the interviewers indicated that Young was a "strong candidate," while marking Hart as a "possible candidate." See Docket Nos. 32-15, at 1; 32-16, at 1; 32-17, at 1; and 32-18, at 1. On September 7, 2012, Hart learned that Young had been chosen for the position. Docket No. 32-1, at 2. EMCF officials contend that their decision was primarily based on the fact that Young had more experience in management, staffing and security. Id.
Shift rotations at EMCF for all Captains and Lieutenants were instituted on September 10, 2012. (Email Correspondence) Docket No. 32, at 19. As a result, Hart was removed from [*3]  the day shift and placed on nights. Id. She also was required to work longer hours. Id. Because of her Crohn's disease, Hart requested to be placed back on the day schedule. Id. On October 12, 2012, MTC accommodated her request, placing her on the 7am to 7pm shift. See (ADA Accommodation Approval Letter) Docket No. 32-21 (ensuring Plaintiff that the facility was in the process of transitioning to eight hour shifts and that she would be placed on either the 1st [7am to 3pm] or 2nd [3pm to 11pm] shift). Still, Hart viewed the new work schedule as retaliation for her previous grievance over the shift change. She wrote to the administration complaining of a hostile work environment and explaining that being placed on any shift other than the day shift was "payback." Docket No. 32-22. This complaint prompted an investigation by MTC, wherein it concluded that there was no retaliation since a reasonable accommodation based on Hart's condition had already been made when her request not to work over night was granted. Docket No. 32-23 (letter from MTC stating that "[t]he overall shift schedule was based on metrics of managerial skill, years of experience, and overall need of the Facility").
October [*4]  26, 2012 was Hart's last day reporting to work at MTC. See (Plaintiff's Depo.) Docket No. 32-2, at 13-14. The human resource department ordered a medical update on her Crohn's diagnosis on October 2, 2012, and, according to Plaintiff, October 26 was the earliest date she could travel to see her physician in Michigan. Id. at 13. Before leaving, Hart turned in her uniform and gear to Officer Jonathan Hampton. Id. The delivery of her uniform, combined with a report of Hart announcing her intent to resign [Docket No. 32-11], caused MTC to investigate the circumstances surrounding her resignation. Docket No. 32-14. It concluded that she had in fact resigned. (Investigation Memo) Docket No. 32-14 (stating that an interview was conducted with Janie Birdtail [Grievance Counselor at EMCF] wherein she conveyed that Hart told her she was resigning). Hart maintains that she never resigned but was instead unlawfully terminated.
Hart initiated a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claiming discrimination on the bases of sex, retaliation, age and disability. Docket No. 1-1. The EEOC issued its Notice of Right to Sue upon her request. Docket No. 1-2. Hart filed suit on [*5]  March 3, 2014, alleging that Defendants violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ("ADEA"), as amended; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"). She maintains that she never resigned but was instead unlawfully terminated due to her age, gender, and disability. She also argues that MTC's employment decision concerning the Captain position was based on discriminatory reasons and that MTC retaliated against her. Defendants seek summary judgment on all claims.

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is only appropriate when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute is genuine "if the evidence supporting its resolution in favor of the party opposing summary judgment, together with any inferences in such party's favor that the evidence allows, would be sufficient to support a verdict in favor of that party." St. Amant v. Benoit, 806 F.2d 1294, 1297 (5th Cir. 1987) (citation omitted). A fact is material if it is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
A party seeking to avoid summary judgment must identify admissible evidence [*6]  in the record showing a fact dispute. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). That evidence may include "depositions, . . . affidavits or declarations, . . . or other materials." Id. When evaluating a motion for summary judgment, a court refrains from making credibility determinations and does not weigh evidence or draw from the facts legitimate inferences for the movant. Strong v. Dep't of Army, 414 F. Supp. 2d 625, 628 (S.D. Miss. 2005).

III. DISCUSSION
Hart asserts the following claims against MTC, premised on her contention that she was unlawfully terminated and that Defendant made a discriminatory employment decision: (1) age discrimination under the ADEA, (2) gender discrimination under Title VII, (3) disability discrimination under the ADA, and (4) retaliation under the ADA. (Complaint) Docket No. 1, at 4-6.1 MTC contends that summary judgment is warranted because Hart cannot establish her prima facie case for these claims. Specifically, MTC contends that Hart lacks proof of any adverse employment actions. It contends that she was never terminated, but instead resigned when she turned in her uniforms and went to her home state of Michigan, never reporting for work again. Defendant also argues that its challenged hiring decision for the subject Captain position2 was grounded in legitimate, [*7]  nondiscriminatory reasons.
The familiar framework established in the Supreme Court's McDonnell Douglas, instructs that Plaintiff carries the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination on all of her claims. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Once she establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action. Id. After the employer meets its burden of production, Plaintiff's burden of persuasion arises and she must prove that the proffered reasons are pretexts for the claimed discrimination. See, e.g., St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 536, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993).
In advancing her claims of discrimination based on age, disability and gender, Hart contends that she was terminated. Loss of employment is an adverse action. That fact is generally understood. See Valderaz v. Lubbock County Hosp. Dist., 611 Fed. Appx. 816, 2015 WL 387788 (5th Cir. 2015). She, therefore, claims she has met her initial burden under McDonnell Douglas. See Martin v. Lennox Int'l Inc., 342 F. App'x 15, 18 (5th Cir. 2009) (stating that a plaintiff must establish that he suffered an adverse employment action to establish a prima facie [*9]  case of discrimination under either the ADA or the ADEA); Urbano v. Continental Airlines Inc., 138 F.3d 204, 206 (5th Cir. 1998) (explaining that proof of an adverse employment action is required to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination). The majority of Hart's claims are grounded on the adverse employment action of unlawful termination. The evidence, however, fails to demonstrate that Hart was terminated. The absence of such proof is fatal to most of Hart's claims.

A. Age Discrimination
Hart points to various age-related comments that her superiors made about her, and she contends that she was discharged because of her age.3 Without delving into the comments, the problem with this contention is that Hart was not discharged. In order for Hart to establish her prima facie case of age discrimination, she must prove: that she is (1) within the protected class; (2) qualified for the position; (3) has suffered an adverse employment decision; and (4) was replaced by someone younger or treated less favorably than similarly situated younger employees. Smith v. City of Jackson Miss., 351 F.3d 183, 196 (5th Cir. 2003) (citations and quotation marks omitted). The fact that she has not suffered an adverse employment action is dispositive of this claim.
There is no evidence which demonstrates that Hart was terminated. What the pleadings do establish, however, is grounds for her employer to reasonably conclude that Hart resigned. Hart's actions on this occasion were no different from what she had done previously, and she understood that her actions could be interpreted as an indicator that she was resigning. See (Employee Acknowledgement) Docket No. 32-7 (stating that she knew that "uniforms, keys, manuals or any other items issued . . . are either government or Company property and must be returned to the Company prior to the end of [ ] employment"). Hart had turned in her uniform and announced her resignation before. She understood the implications of her actions.4 There are also sworn statements from Officer Hampton, as well as Janie Birdtail, claiming that Hart represented to them [*11]  that she was quitting her job. See (Officer Hampton Statement) Docket No. 32-11 (proclaiming that Hart told him she was "quitting because she [was] tired of get[ting] promises and get[ting] lied to); (Janie Birdtail Statement) Docket No.32-13 (proclaiming that Hart informed her that she "decided to quit").5 After receiving her uniform, MTC conducted an investigation to determine Hart's employment status, and it concluded that she had indeed resigned. (Investigation Memo) Docket No. 32-14. In its Internal Termination Form, MTC classified the departure as "voluntary" and the reason as "dissatisfied." Docket No. 32-5. Hart never reported back to work and MTC did not receive any communications stating her reason for leaving or expressing an intention to still work at the facility. Hart quit her job.
Hart has failed to demonstrate that she was terminated. Therefore, summary judgment is appropriate as [*13]  she cannot establish her prima facie case for age discrimination.

B. Disability Discrimination
Hart's disability discrimination claim is premised on the contention that MTC's decision to place her on the night shift was disability related discrimination. The claim is governed by the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). See 42 U.S.C. § 12112. To state a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, Hart must show: "(1) that [s]he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) [s]he is qualified and able to perform the essential functions of [her] job, and (3) her employer discriminated against [her] because of [her] disability." Kemp v. Holder, 610 F.3d 231, 235 (5th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). The third prong is dispositive of Plaintiff's claim. Hart has not provided the Court with evidence showing that the shift change was made for a discriminatory reason.
The record shows that MTC temporarily changed shifts of all Captains and Lieutenants to twelve hour rotations. See (Email Correspondence) Docket No. 32-19 (email correspondence from Major Derrick Smith explaining that shift changes were made to facilitate personnel decisions and that Hart was moved from days to nights "due to Lieutenant Jordan still need[ing] training"). Displeased with the schedule change, [*14]  Hart requested that she not be required to work the night shift due to her Crohn's disease and her inability to "get steady uninterrupted rest while the sun is shining." (Request for Accommodation) Docket No. 32-20, at 1. MTC granted Hart's accommodation request by placing her on the 7:00 am. to 7:00 p.m. shift, and ensuring that she would be placed on either the first shift rotation (7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.) or the second shift rotation (3:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m.) once the facility completed its process of transitioning back to eight hour shifts. (MTC Response Letter) Docket No. 32-23. It is unrefuted that MTC made reasonable accommodations to address Hart's disability. See Seaman v. CSPH, Inc., 179 F.3d 297, 300 (5th Cir. 1999) ("The ADA requires the employer to make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability ...") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, summary judgment is appropriate on this issue.
Hart also alleges a disability retaliation claim based on her belief that the accommodation provided by MTC was retaliatory. To establish a prima facie case for retaliation, Hart must show that: "(1) she engaged in an activity protected by the [*15]  ADA; (2) she was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Id. at 300 (citation omitted).
Plaintiff's disability retaliation claim lacks merit. There is no evidence that MTC subjected her to an adverse employment action in retaliation for her making disability related complaints. As discussed above, after receiving Hart's complaint, MTC made accommodations to address her limitations by placing her on a different shift and informing her that "[o]nce the Lieutenant's eight hour shift [was] determined," she would be assigned to "1st shift, 2nd shift, or [a] rotation from both 1st and 2nd." A reasonable accommodation made to address Hart's request should not be construed as an adverse employment action. See West v. N.M. Taxation and Revenue Dept., 757 F. Supp.2d 1065, 1121 (D.N.M. 2010) (Granting a reasonable accommodation cannot be a materially adverse employment action."); St. Cyr v. Napolitano, NO. EP-10-CV-208-KC, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121159, 2011 WL 4964101, *19 (W.D. Tex. 2011) ("Although there may be unusual cases, an employer does not typically retaliate against an employee with a reasonable accommodation."). Apparently, Hart preferred a guarantee that she would not be required to work past 7 p.m., but the employee's right is to "a reasonable [*16]  accommodation, not to the employee's preferred accommodation." EEOC v. Agro Distrib. LLC, 555 F.3d 462, 471 (5th Cir.2009) (citation omitted).
Hart cannot establish her prima facie case because she has not presented an adverse employment action stemming from her disability. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate on this issue as well.

C. Gender Discrimination
Hart's gender discrimination claim rests on two arguments. First, she claims that she was terminated due to her gender. Her second claim is that she did not receive the Captain position because of her gender. Gender discrimination claims are governed by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. To establish her prima facie case of gender discrimination, Hart must prove that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she sought and was qualified for a position; (3) she suffered some adverse employment action; and (4) that a person outside her protected class replaced her or was treated more favorably. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.
As previously discussed, Hart's contention that she was unlawfully terminated lacks merit. See supra pp. 7-8. The record simply does not support the conclusion that this adverse employment action occurred.
Regarding her complaint that she was discriminated against when a male colleague [*17]  received the Captain position instead of her, MTC has presented a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for this employment action. In his affidavit, Warden Frank Shaw explains that, while he believed Hart was a "good candidate," he concluded that Young's previous experience as a former Chief of Security made him a "better candidate" for the positon. See (Frank Shaw Affidavit) Docket No. 32-1, at 2. Id. Hart has offered statements, however, which challenge the veracity of this proffered reason.
Upon learning that Young received the captain position instead of her, Hart confronted Warden Shaw. She alleges that her challenges regarding the decision lead to an argument wherein the warden exclaimed that "he made the [hiring] decision," and that he "believe[d] a male can do it better." (Plaintiff's Deposition) Docket No 36-2, at 118-19. In his affidavit, Warden Shaw provides the Court with an explanation for his hiring decision and denies making these statements. (Frank Shaw Affidavit) Docket No. 32-1, at 2.
Plaintiff's declaration is emphatic: Shaw did not offer the position to Hart because he believed a man could do the job better. Though MTC argues that this is merely a self-serving statement, it [*18]  nonetheless creates a jury issue as to the truthfulness of the purported nondiscriminatory reason it provided in response to her charge of gender discrimination. Simply put, it creates a genuine issue for trial. See Johnson v. Turner, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43997, 2012 WL 1067674, at *3 (S.D. Miss. March 29, 2012) ("Johnson has her version of the story, and Turner has hers; this is a classic dispute of fact, and such questions must be left to a jury."). It creates a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the person responsible for making the hiring decision, based it on his belief that a male employee was better suited for the position. See, e.g., Coleman, Sr. v. CMH Homes, Inc., No. 4:09cv168-CWR-KFB, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5503, 2011 WL 198130 (S.D. Miss. Jan. 20, 2011) ("[S]ummary judgment is an inappropriate tool for resolving claims of employment discrimination which involve nebulous questions of motivation and intent ... and motivation and intent depend on complicated inferences from the evidence and are therefore peculiarly within the province of the factfinder.").
Resolution of this case will largely turn on the credibility of Hart and Shaw. Those credibility assessments are properly made by a jury at trial and not the court on a motion for summary judgment. See Fitzpatrick v. Pontotoc County, Mississippi, 612 Fed. Appx. 770, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 13333, *7 (5th Cir. 2015); Man Roland, Inc. v. Kreitz Motor Express, Inc., 438 F.3d 476, 478 (5th Cir. 2006) (explaining that a court [*19]  cannot weigh the evidence or evaluate the credibility of witnesses when considering a motion for summary judgment). Based on the proffered evidence, a jury must determine whether Hart was not selected for the Captain's position because of her gender. Accordingly, summary judgment is denied on this claim.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant's motion for summary judgment should be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.
