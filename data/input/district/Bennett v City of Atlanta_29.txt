Opinion



NON-FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is before the Court on Defendant City of Atlanta's Motion For Summary Judgment (Doc. 57). For the reasons discussed below, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.

Procedural Background
Alvin J. Bennett ("Plaintiff") was employed by Computer Mainstream Corporation ("CMC") as a Computer Operator I (information technology specialist) and assigned to work for the City of Atlanta ("Defendant" or "the City") pursuant to its contract to provide technology services to the City. (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 8, 10). On May 10, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against CMC and the City in which he asserted claims for disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended ("ADA") (Count One) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehabilitation Act") (Count Four); failure to accommodate pursuant to the ADA (Count Two) and the Rehabilitation Act (Count Five); [*2]  retaliation under the ADA (Count Three) and the Rehabilitation Act (Count Six); interference with his rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") (Count Seven); and retaliation under the FMLA (Count Eight). (Doc. 1). Plaintiff later filed an Amended Complaint in which he continues to assert ADA discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation claims against both CMC and the City (Counts One, Two, Three); Rehabilitation Act discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation claims against the City (Counts Four, Five, Six); and FMLA interference and retaliation claims against CMC and the City (Counts Seven and Eight). Plaintiff and CMC settled his claims against CMC and the Court has dismissed those claims. (See Docs. 69, 70, 72).
The City has now filed a motion for summary judgment and supporting brief (Doc. 57), statement of undisputed material facts and exhibits (Doc. 57-1). Plaintiff responded to that motion with supporting brief (Doc. 60), response to Defendant's statement of facts (Doc. 61), and statement of disputed material facts (Doc. 62). The City replied to Plaintiff's response (Doc. 67) and responded to Plaintiff's statement of facts (Doc. 68). With briefing complete, the undersigned now turns to [*3]  the merits of Defendant's motion.

Facts1
The facts, for summary judgment purposes only, are derived from Defendant's statement of undisputed material facts (Doc. 57-1 ("Def. SMF")); Plaintiff's response to Defendant's statement (Doc. 61); Plaintiff's statement of disputed material facts (Doc. 62 ("Pl. SMF")); Defendant's response to Plaintiff's statement (Doc. 68); and uncontroverted record evidence. Many of these facts are taken from the depositions of Plaintiff (Doc. 58 ("Bennett Dep.")); Kathy Bullard (Doc. 63 ("Bullard Dep.")); Gilliani Rivera (Doc. 64 ("Rivera Dep.")); and Sandra Adams (Docs. 65 and 66 ("Adams Dep.")). The undersigned has reviewed the record, including the parties' filings, to determine whether genuine issues of material fact exist to be tried. Yet the court need not "scour the record" to make that determination. Tomasini v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. Of Fla., 315 F. Supp. 2d. 1252, 1260 n.11 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (internal quotation omitted). In ruling on the parties' respective summary judgment motions, the facts are construed in the light most favorable to the non-movant. See Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 26 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2001).
CMC is a temporary staffing agency. (Def. SMF ¶ 2). Sandra Adams is the CEO of CMC. (Pl. SMF ¶ 2). Since 2005 CMC had a contract to provide technology service employees to the City for the [*4]  City's Data Center. (Pl. SMF ¶ 1). The Data Center, which operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week, provides computer and Information Technology ("IT") related support to City departments. (Def. SMF ¶ 15). The Data Center does not close on holidays or on weekends. (Def. SMF ¶ 16). The Data Center is responsible for, among other things, providing technical support to the Atlanta Police Department and its officers who rely on computers while in the field to communicate and to transmit information on a 24/7 basis. (Def. SMF ¶ 17). Kathy Bullard is the current IT Manager of the Data Center, and she held that position at all times relevant to the above-captioned action. (Def. SMF ¶ 19).
In March 2015 Plaintiff interviewed with Gilliani Rivera, Chief Recruiter for CMC. (Def. SMF ¶ 3; Pl. SMF ¶ 4). During his interview, Plaintiff learned that Rivera was recruiting for a temporary position with the City. (Def. SMF ¶ 4). Rivera submitted Plaintiff's resume to the City, and Bullard agreed to interview him at the City's offices. (Pl. SMF ¶ 5). After his interview with Bullard, Plaintiff learned that the City wanted to place him in a Computer Operator I assignment. (Def. SMF ¶ 7). Plaintiff [*5]  accepted the assignment and began working on April 8, 2015 as a Computer Operator I in the City's Data Center. (Def. SMF ¶ 8). In general, Plaintiff's duties included monitoring the computer system and network as well as troubleshooting computer system issues for callers. (Def. SMF ¶ 9). Plaintiff was regularly scheduled to work 40 hours Friday through Monday from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m., including holidays, with the ability to work other shifts with notice. (Pl. SMF ¶ 11). Plaintiff and other CMC contract employees performed their assignments at City Hall working under City supervisors and on the shifts the City assigned them. (Pl. SMF ¶ 20). In 2016, Bullard managed nine people, four contractors from CMC and five permanent City employees. (Pl. SMF ¶ 23). Terry Bryson was the supervisor on the shift Plaintiff worked. (Bennett Dep. 24, 32). Rivera remained Plaintiff's point of contact at CMC. (Pl. SMF ¶ 28).
On July 16, 2015, Plaintiff injured his right knee while cutting the grass at his home, and he was treated at an emergency room. (Def. SMF ¶ 22; Pl. SMF ¶ 57). Plaintiff's injuries affected the major life activities of walking and standing because Plaintiff could not sit for a long period [*6]  of time, could not walk without pain, could barely run and walk, and he would lose his balance. (Def. SMF ¶ 23; Pl. SMF ¶ 68). Plaintiff believes that his knee injuries constitute a disability under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. (Def. SMF ¶ 24). Plaintiff also believes that the injuries constitute a serious health condition under the FMLA. (Def. SMF ¶ 25). On the same day Plaintiff sustained his injuries, Plaintiff called Bullard and Rivera to notify them and to inform them that he was unable to work. (Def. SMF ¶ 26; Pl. SMF ¶¶ 58-59).
Plaintiff sent Rivera a doctor's note providing a return date of July 27, 2015, and CMC contacted Bullard to let her know. (Pl. SMF ¶¶ 60-61). Plaintiff returned to work on July 27, 2015. (Def. SMF ¶ 29; Pl. SMF ¶ 64). When Plaintiff returned to work, he told Rivera he would have a follow-up appointment with his doctor regarding his knee injury. (Pl. SMF ¶ 65). In 2015, Plaintiff told Bullard and Rivera that he needed surgery and would have it as soon as the Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital had space to schedule him. (Def. SMF ¶ 30; Pl. SMF ¶¶ 67, 69). Plaintiff also told Bullard in March 2016 that he was going to have surgery on his knee, but he [*7]  did not know when or how long he was going to be out. (Bullard Dep. 37-39; Bennett Dep. 121).
In June 2016 Plaintiff learned that the VA had availability to perform his surgery on June 22, 2016, with a pre-op appointment scheduled for June 21st. (Def. SMF ¶ 31; Pl. SMF ¶ 78). Plaintiff told Bullard that he was having surgery on June 22nd, but he did not know how long he would be out. (Bullard Dep. 48-49). Bullard reminded Plaintiff to discuss his need for leave with CMC. (Pl. SMF ¶ 81). Plaintiff also informed Rivera that he was going to have surgery. (Bennett Dep. 61-62). Because Plaintiff was taking leave in June, Bullard needed a contractor to fill in for his shift. (Pl. SMF ¶ 77). On June 7, 2016, Bullard sent an email to Rivera, copied to Adams, in which she wrote, "Sandra per our telephone conversation about Alvin Bennett proposed operation on 06/22/2016, we need to look at using another contractor to fill position because of the uncertainty of his return. Please get back with me on this after you talk with him." (Doc. 63-2 at 3). Adams sent Bullard and Rivera an email on June 7, 2016: "We have a call out to Mr. Bennett now. We also need to let the person replacing him know that [*8]  this may be short-term pending his return." (Id.). Adams asked Bullard to "[p]lease specify whom you wish to take Alvin's position whether it be temporary or long-term," and wrote, "It appears that Kenneth Dunbar would be his 3rd shift replacement. Is my understanding correct?" (Id.).
Rivera contacted Plaintiff to get a few more details, such as an estimate of when he might be returning to work. (Pl. SMF ¶ 93; Rivera Dep. 21-22). She believes that he told her "August, but there wasn't a clear date." (Rivera Dep. 22). Rivera believed that when Plaintiff returned, "he would be returning to the third-shift position at that time[.]" (Rivera Dep. 30). Plaintiff asked Rivera if he needed to fill out any forms for his medical leave, and she responded, "no, we'll take care of it," and she told him he "would have [his] job when [he] came back." (Bennett Dep. 113). Rivera did not provide any FMLA notice or forms to Plaintiff. (Pl. SMF ¶ 102). Plaintiff told Adams he was having surgery but he did not know when he would be back; Adams did not ask Plaintiff if he could obtain the information on when he might return to work before or after his surgery. (Pl. SMF ¶ 103; Adams Dep. 38-40). CMC approved [*9]  Plaintiff's leave request.2 (Pl. SMF ¶ 104; Rivera Dep. 26; Adams Dep. 40-41, 128; Bennett Dep. 116). CMC told Plaintiff to let it know when he might be coming back and to keep it posted on his recovery. (Pl. SMF ¶ 105; Adams Dep. 47). Adams considered Plaintiff still employed when he took the leave. (Pl. SMF ¶ 107).
Plaintiff's last day of work with the City was June 20, 2016. (Def. SMF ¶ 36; Pl. SMF ¶¶ 106, 130). In an email to Bullard dated June 21, 2016, Plaintiff wrote: "Reminder to let you know that I will be having surgery on June 22, 2016. I will keep you informed of the outcome." (Def. SMF ¶ 32; Pl. SMF ¶ 124). Plaintiff did not provide Bullard with an expected date for his return to work. (Bennett Dep. 66). Bullard did not respond to that email. (Bennett Dep. 66-67). Bullard testified that she "[p]ossibly" told Plaintiff "when he talked to [her] about leave, that his job would be waiting on him when he returned[.]" (Bullard Dep. 118-19).
On June 20, 2016, Bullard sent an email to Rivera in which she wrote, "In reviewing Alvin Bennett proposed operation on 06/22/2016, we will need to move quickly on filling the shift preventing disruption." (63-2 at 9). Plaintiff had a pre-op [*10]  appointment on June 21, 2016 and underwent surgery on June 22, 2016. (Def. SMF ¶ 37; Pl. SMF ¶¶ 131-132). Adams sent Bullard an email on June 30, 2016 in which she wrote in relevant part:
Per our discussion, we'll reach out to Kenneth Dunbar to ask if he would be available to work the schedule below on a temporary basis while Alvin Bennett is on leave. Since we do not know when Alvin will return, we will make it clear that we do not have an end date.
(Def. SMF ¶ 50; Doc. 57-1 at 270). CMC needed to check with Dunbar to see if he was willing to work a short-term assignment on the third shift since he had interviewed for a full-time position, but someone else got that position. (Rivera Dep. 70). Rivera told Dunbar that he was being hired for a "short-term position filling - backfilling a medical leave" and that the employee may return to the position, and Dunbar "was okay with that[.]" (Rivera Dep. 29-30). Bullard testified that CMC told Dunbar that he was replacing Plaintiff "and that he was out temporarily and that the position might not continue when he returned." (Bullard Dep. 52-53). Dunbar took over Plaintiff's third-shift duties. (Rivera Dep. 29; Adams Dep. 50-51; Bullard Dep. 46). [*11]  Invoices for CMC's contractors who worked for the City show that Dunbar's pay first appears on the August 4, 2016 invoice indicating his hours for the week ending July 24, 2016. (Compare Doc. 66-2 at 62 (7/27/2016 invoice) with Doc. 66-2 at 64 (8/4/2016 invoice)).
On July 7, 2016, Plaintiff sent an email to Bullard with a doctor's note dated July 6, 2016 attached.3 (Pl. SMF ¶ 133; Doc. 63-2 at 21, 30). The doctor wrote that Plaintiff had right knee surgery on June 22, 2016 "that requires at least 6 [weeks to] 12 [weeks] for healing" and asked to "kindly excuse him in the interim." (Doc. 63-2 at 21). Plaintiff wrote in his email to Bullard, "Hi Kathy, I am sending information in reference to my return to work. I have an appointment with my Doctor on August 11, 2016, I should be ready to return by Monday August 15, to work." (Doc. 63-2 at 30). Plaintiff also sent the doctor's note to Rivera, who forwarded it to Adams, and he sent Rivera an email on July 7, 2016 in which he told her that he had an appointment on August 11th and "should be returning to work on Monday August 15." (Pl. SMF ¶ 137; Def. resp. to Pl. SMF ¶ 137; Doc. 64-2 at 11). Bullard admits that while Plaintiff was out on [*12]  leave, CMC sent her updates on his leave. (Pl. SMF ¶ 139; Bullard Dep. 50). Bullard does not recall if Plaintiff sent her emails or left her any voice messages while he was on leave but concedes he "could have." (Pl. SMF ¶ 140; Bullard Dep. 51-52).4
On August 1, 2016, Plaintiff emailed Bullard and informed her that his next doctor's appointment was on August 11, 2016, and he "will be available for work after that date," but he "need[ed] to know what shift that I'll be on, per our previous conversation about 3rd shift 10:30-07:00 a.m." (Doc. 63-2 at 23). Bullard did not reply to the email. (Pl. SMF ¶ 144). On August 11, 2016, Plaintiff received a letter from Dr. Andrew M. Doll at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. (Def. SMF ¶ 41; Pl. SMF ¶ 145). Dr. Doll wrote that Plaintiff may return to work without any restrictions as of August 16, 2016. (Def. SMF ¶ 42; Pl. SMF ¶¶ 145-146). Plaintiff hand-delivered a copy of Dr. Doll's letter to Bullard on August 11, 2016, and he emailed a copy of the letter to Rivera on the same day. (Def. SMF ¶¶ 43-44; Pl. SMF ¶¶ 145, 147, 149). When Plaintiff gave Bullard the doctor's letter, she told him she had to "get with Terry Bryson, the supervisor, on the hours." [*13]  (Bennett Dep. 75). Bullard testified that she "could have" told Bennett that either CMC or Bryson would be contacting him "to let him know when he could be coming back to work[.]" (Bullard Dep. 54, 120). When Plaintiff got home, he called Bullard and "asked her did I still have my job, would I be coming back, and she told me yes." (Bennett Dep. 76-77; see also id. 119). Bullard conceded that Plaintiff "could have" called her after he gave her the doctor's note. (Bullard Dep. 54). No one from the City or CMC contacted him to schedule him for a shift, so Plaintiff called Bullard and Rivera seeking information on which he should report to work, but they did not respond by calling him back. (Bennett Dep. 120; Rivera Dep. 64; Bullard Dep. 120).
On August 15, 2016, Plaintiff sent an email to Bullard in which he wrote, "As you know I was released from the Doctor on Thursday. I called the Temp Agency to contact you because I hadn't heard back from you yet. Sorry to keep bothering you but I need my job and am enthusiastic about coming back." (Pl. SMF ¶ 160; Doc. 64-2 at 21). Bullard never responded to Plaintiff's emails or voice messages after he was cleared by his doctor to return to work. [*14]  (Pl. SMF ¶ 219; Bullard Dep. 119-20). Rivera also sent Bullard an email on August 15, 2017: "Alvin [Bennett] has been cleared and ready to come back to work. Please advise as to what you would like to do." (Def. ¶ 53; Doc. 57-1 at 272). On August 17, 2016, Rivera emailed Bullard again: "Just checking in from the email I sent you on Monday. Alvin has been cleared and read to come back to work. Please advise as to what you would like to do." (Doc. 64-2 at 16). Plaintiff emailed Rivera on August 18th: "I tried to connect with you today to find out if you reached Kathy. I am still trying to see if I will be called back to work." (Doc. 64-2 at 14). Rivera responded the next day, "I've tried calling AND emailing Kathy every day the last few days. I still have not heard back from her. I will contact her again." (Id.).
Plaintiff filed for unemployment benefits the week of August 18, 2016 because he had not been scheduled to return to work and was without income. (Bennett Dep. 78-79).
On August 22, 2016, Adams sent an email to Bullard in which she wrote, "Alvin Bennett has been cleared to work following his medical leave. Please provide us with instructions as to how you would like to reinstate [*15]  him to his position. If there are other options available, please let us know." (Pl. SMF ¶ 165; Doc. 64-2 at 16). Bullard admits that the CMC let the City know that Plaintiff was medically ready to return to work. (Pl. SMF ¶ 168). Adams testified that she also had a conversation with Bullard and "did suggest" putting Plaintiff back in his shift, but "we have to keep in mind that [Bullard] makes the decisions on who she puts where in her department; I don't." (Adams Dep. 85). On August 22nd, Plaintiff again asked Rivera whether she had "heard from Kathy," and Rivera responded the next day, "Not as of yet. I've escalated it to Sandra [Adams], who called & emailed Kathy yesterday. We'll keep you updated." (Doc. 64-2 at 17).
On August 24, 2016, Bullard wrote an email to Rivera, copied to Adams:
After discussions with staff that have worked with both Alvin and Ken and observation, it was determined that Ken will remain and Alvin will be used at this time as the backup support for contractor vacation, holidays, et cetera, if he accept [sic].
(Doc. 64-2 at 19). Bullard testified that in reaching that decision, she only obtained input from Terry Bryson, the supervisor of that shift.5 (Bullard [*16]  Dep. 64-65, 103, 121). Adams responded to Bullard, "We'll speak to Alvin and Ken to discuss your decision. Thank you for letting us know." (Def. SMF ¶ 56; Doc. 64-2 at 19). Rivera called Bennett, told him that Bullard "had decided to stay with the guy who had replaced [him]," "apologized and explained to him it was not our decision" but the City's, and she offered him a backup contractor assignment with the City in which he would work holidays, vacations, and on an as-needed basis. (Bennett Dep. 80; Rivera Dep. 36, 62-64; Doc. 64-2 at 25). Plaintiff "wasn't happy about" the situation and told Rivera he would think about it; on August 29, 2016, Plaintiff told Rivera he would accept the backup contractor position. (Pl. SMF ¶ 189; Rivera Dep. 61; Doc. 64-2 at 20, 25).
Rivera went out on leave around August 31, 2016, and Anita Sain took over her duties. (Rivera Dep. 38). Sain called Plaintiff to ask if he accepted the position, and he told her he had through Rivera. (Bennett Dep. 82-83). Sain told Plaintiff that she would get back with him after checking with Rivera, but Plaintiff never spoke with Sain, Rivera, or Bullard again. (Bennett Dep. 83, 105-06; Rivera Dep. 40). No one from the [*17]  City or CMC ever communicated to him that his assignment had been terminated or that his employment had been terminated (Bennett Dep. 83-84), but it is undisputed that neither CMC or the City called him back to work.
On September 13, 2016, Bullard sent an email to Adams asking what the results of her discussions with Dunbar and Bennett were. (Pl. SMF ¶ 192; Doc. 64-2 at 22). Adams responded:
We did speak to Ken first and then Alvin last week. Ken, as we understand it, is working another position. However, he is pleased to continue working at the City. Alvin was understandably disappointed but has agreed to work as a backup. I would recommend having an additional backup with the expectation that he may find a full-time position. Please let us know if you have any further questions.
(Pl. SMF ¶ 193; Doc. 64-2 at 22).
On September 22, 2016, Adams received a letter via email sent to CMC by Plaintiff's previous attorney in which the attorney asserted that the City's conduct "is in direct violation" of the ADA and FMLA because it "has yet to place [Plaintiff] back in to his former position. As such, it appears Atlanta is attempting to terminate [Plaintiff] based on animus towards his disability [*18]  and his use of FMLA to receive treatment for his injury." (Pl. SMF ¶ 209; Doc. 66-2 at 4-7). On September 28, 2016, Adams forwarded the letter to Bullard and wrote that Plaintiff was "filing suit against CMC, his employer, and the City of Atlanta," and that the attorney wrote that Plaintiff "has legal claims including but not limited to those arising under FMLA as well as ADA Laws." (Pl. SMF ¶ 211; Def. SMF ¶ 66; Doc. 66-2 at 7). Upon receiving notice of Plaintiff's allegations, Bullard promptly notified the City's HR Department. (Def. SMF ¶ 67; Pl. SMF ¶ 215).
When Rivera returned from leave around September 21 or 25, she asked Adams what happened with Plaintiff, and Adams replied that the City never called him back to work. (Pl. SMF 202; River Dep. 38, 40-41). Bullard never communicated with CMC that she needed Plaintiff to work any days in the new position. (Pl. SMF ¶¶ 200, 221; Bullard Dep. 67). During her deposition, Bullard was asked when she called Plaintiff for a shift, and she replied, "I did not call him at that particular time. The schedule was already made. He was scheduled to come on right after that, but then I received the complaint from - I received an e-mail from CMC [*19]  saying he had rendered a complaint against the City. So . . . ." (Pl SMF ¶ 213; Bullard Dep. 57). Bullard was then asked whether Plaintiff was ever called in to work a holiday or vacation for the backup position, and she replied, "Received the complaint. CMC sent the e-mail saying they received a [discrimination] complaint. So, therefore . . . ." (Pl. SMF ¶ 214; Bullard Dep. 58). When asked what she meant by "therefore," Bullard testified that she "went to HR for instructions at that point" and HR "turned it over to the lawyers at that point." (Bullard Dep. 59-60). Bullard testified that she "was waiting on instructions from the lawyer at that point," but no one from HR or the City told her to bring Plaintiff. (Bullard Dep. 59-60, 67).
The City never used the backup contractor position until it used a CMC contractor for a 30-day project in 2018. (Pl. SMF ¶ 206; Bullard Dep. 96-97). Bullard testified that otherwise she never had a need to assign anyone to that position.6 (Pl. SMF ¶ 207; Bullard Dep. 31). Instead, she just used contractors or employees to cover the different shifts when there was a need due to an employee or contractor taking a vacation or a holiday. (Pl. SMF ¶ 208; Bullard [*20]  Dep. 31-32). Toward the end of 2016, Bullard told Adams that the City was never going to call Plaintiff back for a shift. (Pl. SMF ¶ 226; Adams Dep. 67-68). Plaintiff did not return to work with the City after the surgery. (Def. SMF ¶ 47; Pl resp. to Def. SMF ¶ 47).
Plaintiff filed his Charge of Discrimination against the City with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") on November 16, 2016. (Def. SMF ¶ 70; Pl. SMF ¶ 218). On May 18, 2017, Adams removed Plaintiff from CMC's payroll and "closed his file" with CMC because Plaintiff was not going to be called back to work. (Adams Dep. 70, 97, 107; Doc. 64-2 at 26). Counsel asked Adams if she called Bullard before taking Plaintiff off the payroll and asked, "are you not ever going to use him again so we can take him off of our system?" and Adams responded, "I did speak to her. And . . . I can't tell you what the City was thinking. By that time, we had the EEOC complaint. By that time, the lawsuit had been filed." (Adams Dep. 107). Bullard testified that she did not terminate Plaintiff, even though he was given "an alternate shift" for which he was never called to work. (Bullard Dep. 65-66, 119). According to Adams, Plaintiff [*21]  was never terminated, he was just never assigned any hours after his leave. (Pl. SMF ¶ 235; Adams Dep. 70, 110).

Discussion

I. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is proper "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support that assertion by[] . . . citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). The moving party has an initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986); see also Arnold v. Litton Loan Servicing, LP, No. 1:08-cv-2623-WSD, 2009 WL 5200292, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 23, 2009) ("The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact.") (citing Herzog v. Castle Rock Entm't, 193 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir. 1999)). If the non-moving party will bear the burden of proving the material issue at trial, then in order to defeat summary judgment, that party must respond by going beyond the pleadings, and by the party's [*22]  own affidavits, or by the discovery on file, identify facts sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue for trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 324. "No genuine issue of material fact exists if a party has failed to 'make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element . . . on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.'" AFL-CIO v. City of Miami, 637 F.3d 1178, 1186-87 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322).
Furthermore, "[a] nonmoving party, opposing a motion for summary judgment supported by affidavits[,] cannot meet the burden of coming forth with relevant competent evidence by simply relying on legal conclusions or evidence which would be inadmissible at trial." Avirgan v. Hull, 932 F.2d 1572, 1577 (11th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 952 (1992); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B), (c)(4). The evidence "cannot consist of conclusory allegations or legal conclusions." Avirgan, 932 F.2d at 1577. Unsupported self-serving statements by the party opposing summary judgment are insufficient to avoid summary judgment. See Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705, 714 (11th Cir. 1984).
For a dispute about a material fact to be "genuine," the evidence must be such that "a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). "If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted." Id. at 249-50 (internal citations omitted). It is not the court's function at the summary judgment stage [*23]  to determine credibility or decide the truth of the matter. Id. at 249, 255. Rather, "[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [the nonmovant's] favor." Id. at 255.

II. Abandoned Claims
In response to Defendant's motion, Plaintiff states that he voluntarily abandons his ADA discrimination claim (Count One) but he "will challenge the adverse action of never assigning him any hours in the backup position through his ADA and FMLA retaliation claims." (Doc. 60 at 1 n.1). In his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant retaliated against him under the ADA by not promoting him to a position that had been held by an employee who died (Doc. 40 ¶¶ 21-30, 70), but he did not address that claim in his response brief and thus appears to have abandoned it as well. (See Doc. 60 at 1 n.1). He also asserts that he voluntarily abandons his claims under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Counts Four, Five, and Six"). (Id.). It is therefore RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED on Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim (Count One), his ADA retaliatory failure to promote claim (part of Count Three) and his Rehabilitation Act claims (Counts Four, Five, and Six). The undersigned [*24]  now considers the merits of Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's remaining ADA claims (Counts Two and Three), and his FMLA claims (Counts Seven and Eight).

III. Plaintiff's ADA Claims (Counts Two and Three)
In Count Two, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant "violated the ADA by failing to grant Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation to take eight weeks to take care of his disability," and "[r]ather than accommodate Plaintiff by allowing this leave, Defendant[] terminated Plaintiff." (Doc. 40 ¶¶ 64, 65). In Count Three, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff for engaging in protected activity under the ADA. (Id. ¶¶ 69-70).

A. Failure To Accommodate Claim

1. Relevant ADA Standards
"The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating against a 'qualified individual on the basis of disability.'" McCarroll v. Somerby of Mobile, LLC, 595 Fed. Appx. 897, 899 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). "In the context of a failure-to-accommodate claim, an employer discriminates by 'not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical . . . limitations of an otherwise qualified individual . . . unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business.' " Hill v. Clayton Cty. Sch. Dist., 619 Fed. Appx. 916, 920 (11th Cir. 2015) (unpublished decision) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). "To establish [*25]  a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on a failure-to-accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) []he is disabled; (2)[]he was a 'qualified individual' when []he suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) that []he was discriminated against because of h[is] disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow h[im] to keep working." Cappetta v. North Fulton Eye Ctr., No. 1:15-CV-3412-LMM-JSA, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214906, at *69 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 1, 2017), adopted by 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214787 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 7, 2017).
Defendant does not dispute for purposes of summary judgment that Plaintiff was disabled or that he was a qualified individual under the ADA. Rather, it contends that Plaintiff "cannot establish that the City denied him a reasonable accommodation." (Doc. 57 at 7). Defendant argues that "Plaintiff's claim fails for two reasons: (1) Even if the City jointly employed Plaintiff, as she alleges,7 Plaintiff never made a timely, specific request for an accommodation sufficient to trigger the City's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation; and (2) [e]ven if Plaintiff made a specific request for an accommodation, his request was for an indefinite leave of absence, which is not a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." (Id. at 7-8). Defendant also argues that Plaintiff "has not shown that he was denied leave [*26]  or that he should have been reinstated to his former position or a similar position by the City." (Id. at 11).

a. Did Plaintiff Make A "Specific, Timely Request" For A Reasonable Accommodation?
"An accommodation is reasonable and necessary under the ADA 'only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job.'" Medearis v. CVS Pharm., Inc., 646 Fed. Appx. 891, 895 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007)). "The ADA does not require an employer to eliminate essential functions of the job, however; if an individual is unable to perform them, even with the accommodation, []he cannot meet the definition of qualified." Id. (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256-57). "The burden is on the plaintiff to identify a reasonable accommodation the employer should have made." Id. (citing Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998)). Moreover, "the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made[.]" Gaston v. Bellingrath, 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999). "In order to determine an appropriate reasonable accommodation, an informal, interactive process with the disabled individual may be necessary." Webb v. Donley, 347 Fed. Appx. 443, 446 (11th Cir. 2009) (unpublished decision) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)) (emphasis in original); accord Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Harris v. Mills, 572 F.3d 66, 75 (2d Cir. 2009) (explaining that the ADA "envisions an interactive process by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee's disability [*27]  can be reasonably accommodated") (internal quotation omitted).
Defendant argues that "Plaintiff never triggered the City's duty to engage in the interactive process—let alone any duty to provide a reasonable accommodation—because he never made a sufficiently specific demand. He simply notified the City that he would be undergoing surgery with no indication when he would return to work." (Doc. 57 at 8-9). Thus, Defendant contends, "[b]ecause Plaintiff never made a specific request for an accommodation from the City, the City had no duty to engage in the interactive process or to provide any accommodation to Plaintiff." (Id. at 9). Defendant also asserts that "Plaintiff's request for an accommodation was untimely" because "Plaintiff did not request leave while he was still working his assignment in the Data Center. Indeed, he did not notify the City of his return to work date until six weeks after his surgery." (Id.). Finally, Defendant contends that Plaintiff did not request a reasonable accommodation because "his request was for an indefinite leave of absence." (Id. at 10). The undersigned finds genuine issues of material fact to be tried on each of Defendant's contentions.
The record [*28]  contains evidence that following his knee injury in July 2015, Plaintiff informed both the City and CMC that he would need knee surgery but could not say when the surgery would be scheduled because it was contingent on the VA scheduling the surgery. (Def. SMF ¶ 30; Pl. SMF ¶ 67, 69; Bullard Dep. 37-39; Bennett Dep. 121). In early June 2016, Plaintiff informed Rivera and Bullard that he would be having his surgery on June 22, 2016. (Bullard Dep. 48-49; Bennett Dep. 61-62). When Rivera asked him how long he would be out, Plaintiff told her "August, but there wasn't a clear date." (Rivera Dep. 22). On June 21, 2016, Plaintiff emailed Bullard to remind her of his surgery the next day and told her, "I will keep you informed of the outcome." (Def. SMF ¶ 32; Pl. SMF ¶ 124). He then emailed Bullard on July 7, 2016 after he had had the surgery and told her that he had an appointment with his doctor on August 11, 2016, and he "should be ready to return by Monday August 15, to work." (Doc. 63-2 at 30). He also provided her with a doctor's note indicating that Plaintiff had right knee surgery on June 22, 2016, which "requires at least 6 [weeks to] 12 [weeks] for healing." (Doc. 63-2 at 21). He [*29]  emailed Bullard again on August 1, 2016 and told her that after his August 11th doctor's appointment, he "will be available for work after that date." (Doc. 63-2 at 23). After his August 11th doctor's appointment, Plaintiff provided Bullard and CMC with a doctor's note showing that he was cleared to return to work on August 16, 2016 with no restrictions (Def. SMF ¶¶ 41-44; Pl. SMF ¶ 145-147, 149), consistent with his original report to Rivera that he anticipated being out until August (Rivera Dep. 22), with his doctor's July 6, 2016 note indicating that Plaintiff's surgical recovery would take 6 to 12 weeks (Doc. 63-2 at 21), and with his July 7, 2016 and August 1, 2016 emails to Bullard informing her that he anticipated being ready to work after his August 11, 2016 doctor's appointment (Doc. 63-2 at 23, 30).
Focusing entirely on Plaintiff's pre-surgery communications and ignoring all of his subsequent communications, Defendant asserts that "[t]he request that Plaintiff did make before his surgery was for indefinite leave," which is "per se unreasonable." (Doc. 67 at 4). The Eleventh Circuit has explained that "[w]hile a leave of absence might be a reasonable accommodation in some cases," [*30]  a request for an indefinite leave of absence is not a request for a reasonable accommodation. Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003); see also Spears v. Creel, 607 Fed. Appx. 943, 950 (11th Cir. 2015) (unpublished decision) ("[A]n extended leave of absence of a definite duration, as opposed to an indefinite duration, may be a reasonable accommodation in certain circumstances." (citing Wood, 323 F.3d at 1312-13)). In Wood, the court rejected the plaintiff's contention that his requested indefinite leave of absence was a reasonable accommodation for his cluster headaches. Id. at 1314. The court acknowledged that the plaintiff "might return to work within a month or two, or he could be stricken with another cluster headache soon after his return and require another indefinite leave of absence." Id. Citing Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222 (11th Cir. 1997), the court found that the plaintiff was not a qualified individual under the ADA because he "was not requesting an accommodation that allowed him to continue work in the present, but rather, in the future - at some indefinite time." Wood, 323 at 1314. In Duckett, the court found that the plaintiff had not requested a reasonable accommodation because his requested leave "would have been for an indefinite period—not just a month or two. Put differently, Plaintiff could not represent that he likely would have been able to work within a month [*31]  or two." 120 F.3d at 1226. The court noted that the plaintiff "had already been on medical leave for ten months, had only two months of eligibility for the Salary Continuation Plan remaining, and had no way of knowing when his doctor would allow him to return to work in any capacity." Id. Similarly, the court in Wood also noted that the plaintiff "had been granted years of discretionary leave and had been on a discretionary leave for over one month at the time of his termination." 323 F.3d at 1314.
In contrast to the facts in Wood and Duckett, the evidence cited above creates an issue of fact on whether Plaintiff requested a definite period of leave, i.e., one that would allow him to return to work "within a month or two" of his June 22, 2016 surgery, Duckett, 120 F.3d at 1226. In fact, he was able to return to work without any restrictions within two months of his surgery. It is true that prior to Plaintiff's surgery he was unable to provide a definitive date of return, but he did inform CMC and the City when his surgery was scheduled, and he told Rivera that he anticipated returning in August, thus indicating that he would be able to return in "just a month or two." Duckett, 120 F.3d at 1226. Moreover, Plaintiff continued to update CMC and the City as to his doctors' visits and [*32]  his expected return in August, and his doctor released him to work as of August 16, 2016. Thus, the evidence concerning Plaintiff's requested leave for knee surgery and recovery is distinguishable from that in Duckett and Wood and creates an issue of fact on whether Plaintiff requested a reasonable accommodation under the ADA when he requested leave for his knee surgery and recovery, thus triggering the City's obligation to engage in the interactive process and to provide a reasonable accommodation.8 See, e.g., Nix v. McMaster Carr Supply Co., No. 1:17-CV-02785-SCJ-JFK, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 222827, at *75-77 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 27, 2018) (finding issues of fact on whether defendant could have reasonably accommodated plaintiff's disability by granting leave: "Plaintiff's identification of a specific time in the immediate future when she was scheduled to meet with a physiatrist reveals that this was not a situation where she was 'requesting a leave of absence that would allow [her] to work "at some indefinite point" in the future'" (quoting Billups v. Emerald Coast Utils. Auth., 714 Fed. Appx. 929, 935 (11th Cir. 2017) (quoting Wood, 323 F.3d at 1314))), adopted by 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43705 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 11, 2019); Sharbaugh v. West Haven Manor, LP, No. 14-1723, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161264, at *40-43 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2016) (rejecting the defendant's contention that plaintiff's request for leave to have knee surgeries was unreasonable where he and his doctor estimated a window in which he might be able to return but could not guarantee the exact day he would return: "No medical [*33]  professional can foresee the exact day on which a patient will be recovered. No medical professional can know whether there will be complications or delays with a patient's recovery, especially before surgery is even performed. That, however, does not render Sharbaugh's leave request indefinite and open-ended, as a matter of law."); Dunn v. Chattanooga Publ. Co., 993 F. Supp. 2d 830, 844-45 (E.D. Tenn. 2014) (rejecting defendant's argument that the requested accommodation was unreasonable because the plaintiff "did not provide a specific start or end date for her requested leave" because the plaintiff informed her supervisor when her surgery was scheduled and that she would need between four and eight weeks for recovery, which was a reasonable amount of time to request for leave).
The facts in this case are also distinguishable from those in which the plaintiff requested indefinite leave or failed to show that he would have been able to return to work with additional leave. See, e.g., Billups, 714 Fed. Appx. at 936 (finding that the plaintiff's "request for additional leave was essentially an open-ended request for 'sufficient time to ameliorate his conditions' following the surgery," noting that the plaintiff had received over six months of leave to allow recovery, and there was "uncertainty [*34]  about when Billups could perform the essential functions of his position in the future"); Santandreau v. Miami Dade Cnty., 513 Fed. Appx. 902, 906 (11th Cir. 2013) (unpublished decision) (finding that the plaintiff was not a qualified individual under the ADA because he "never demonstrated that he would be able to return to work within a reasonable time," he "had already taken several leaves of absence, received a total of fifteen months of leave, and still had no way of knowing when his doctor would allow him to resume full-time work," and at the time of trial, he "still had not received medical clearance showing that he was able to work"); West v. Tampa Hous. Auth. Dev. Corp., No. 8:18-cv-44-T-33AEP, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186052, at *4-5, 15-17 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 31, 2018) (finding that plaintiff did not request a reasonable accommodation where he requested additional leave after expiration of 12 weeks of FMLA leave but did not indicate when additional leave would end and "there is evidence that West would not have been able to perform the essential functions of his job for months after his termination in June 2016"); Dee v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., No. CV 114-176, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42262, at *18-19 (S.D. Ga. Mar. 30, 2016) (acknowledging that "extended leave - as opposed to indefinite leave - may be a reasonable accommodation," but noting that the plaintiff had not pointed to evidence that establishes such a leave would have allowed him to perform the essential functions of the job where [*35]  "Dr. Lynn testified that, although he did not officially evaluate Plaintiff for return to his position, Plaintiff would not have been able to return to anesthesiology at the end of his treatment."); Turner v. UPS, No. 2:13-CV-823-WMA, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126590, at *18-19 n.6 (N.D. Ala. Sept. 10, 2014) (explaining that the "court could not find leave to be a reasonable accommodation in this case" because "no evidence has been presented that leave would have enabled Turner to perform her job's essential functions, especially in light of the undisputed evidence that the conditions were permanent").
The undersigned finds that genuine issues of material fact exist on whether Plaintiff made a timely, specific request for a reasonable accommodation for his disability.

b. Did Defendant Deny Requested Accommodation?
Defendant argues that "Plaintiff has not shown that he was denied leave or that he should have been reassigned or reinstated to his former position or a similar position by the City." (Doc. 57 at 11). The undersigned finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists on whether the Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's disability when the City: did not reinstate him to the full-time shift position he held when he went out on medical leave related to his disability; [*36]  replaced him with Kenneth Dunbar, the person who had been assigned to fill that position on a "temporary" and "short-term" basis while Plaintiff was on "medical leave" (see Doc. 57-1 at 270; Rivera Dep. 29-30; Bullard Dep. 52-53); and gave Plaintiff a backup contractor assignment but assigned him no hours, thus resulting in no pay for Plaintiff and effectively terminating his assignment with the City.
The City asserts that "Plaintiff has not identified any vacant positions for which he was qualified and to which he could have been reassigned," and therefore "his request is unreasonable and is not required by the ADA." (Doc. 57 at 11). Defendant contends that "[t]o accommodate Plaintiff, the City would either have to: (1) displace another CMC employee who was assigned to the City because no one knew whether or when Plaintiff would return to his assignment; or (2) create another full-time assignment specifically for Plaintiff." (Doc. 67 at 5). The undersigned finds no merit to those assertions for several reasons.
In the first place, Plaintiff has identified a position the City could have put him in when he returned from leave—his own. There is evidence in the record that indicates: the [*37]  person who replaced Plaintiff was hired as a temporary replacement while Plaintiff was on medical leave (Doc. 57-1 at 270; Rivera Dep. 29-30; Bullard Dep. 52-53); on August 11, 2016 when Plaintiff told Bullard he was cleared to return to work she told him that he still had his job but she needed to discuss his hours with Bryson, the supervisor (Bennett Dep. 75-77, 119; Bullard Dep. 54, 120); and that Dunbar only decided after Plaintiff and CMC informed her that Plaintiff was cleared to return to work on August 16, 2016 that the City wanted to keep Dunbar in the third-shift position that Plaintiff had before going on leave (Doc. 64-2 at 19).
Moreover, contrary to Defendant's assertion that "Plaintiff has not identified any vacant positions . . . to which he could have been reassigned" (Doc. 57 at 11), the record shows that Bullard wrote that "Alvin will be used at this time as the backup support for contractor vacation, holidays, et cetera, if he accept[s]." (Doc. 64-2 at 19). Bullard even indicated during her deposition that she could not say that that position would not have involved 40 hours a week given the "constant need in IT." (Bullard Dep. 61). That evidence thus shows that theoretically, [*38]  there was a position to which Plaintiff could have been reassigned. In practice the City's offer of the backup contractor position ultimately fell through as the City never called Plaintiff in to work.
The evidence in this case is thus distinguishable from that in Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249 (11th Cir. 2001), a case Defendant cites for the proposition that Plaintiff was not entitled to reassignment or reinstatement. (Doc. 57 at 11). In Lucas, the plaintiff requested "an accommodation in the form of a permanent job that entailed 'desk work'" to accommodate his back impairment, but he alleged that the defendant failed to reasonably accommodate his disability because it did not reassign him to a Customer Service Representative or Distribution Representative position, did not give him one of three positions for which he interviewed, and did not restructure a Bins Sorter position and offer him that position. 257 F.3d at 1253-54, 1256. The court rejected those contentions because: the plaintiff did not show that the CSR position was available; the ADA did not require the defendant to promote plaintiff into the positions for which he interviewed; plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of the Distribution Representative position; and plaintiff [*39]  was not able to perform the essential functions of the Bins Sorter position. Id. at 1257-60. In this case, Plaintiff requested leave and then sought to return to the position he held when he went out on leave; he did not request that the City reassign him, create a new position for him, promote him, or "bump another employee," Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1256, to accommodate his disability.
As discussed above, the undersigned finds genuine issues of material fact to be tried on whether Plaintiff requested a reasonable accommodation for his disability by requesting leave for his knee surgery and resulting recovery. If the jury finds Plaintiff's request for leave was a request for a reasonable accommodation, a reasonable jury could also find that the City failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's disability when it replaced Plaintiff and put him in a position for which it gave him no hours and no pay. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate claim (Count Two) be DENIED.

B. Retaliation Claim
The ADA provides, "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). In order [*40]  to prevail on her retaliation claim, "Plaintiff must show that: (1) []he engaged in a statutorily protected expression, (2) []he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between the two." Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016). "The first element may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation." Id. "The third element requires a showing of but-for causation." Id. (citing Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338 (2013)). If Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to Defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment decision, after which the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the articulated reason is pretext for retaliation. Wilf v. Bd of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., Civil Action File No. 1:09-cv-01877-RLV-GGB, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193700, at *74 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 15, 2012) (citing Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., 513 F.3d 1261, 1277 (11th Cir. 2008)).

1. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case
Defendant contends that Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim fails because he did not engage in statutorily protected activity, i.e., he "never made a specific, timely request for a reasonable accommodation," and he "cannot show that he suffered an adverse employment action." (Doc. 57 at 19).

a. Statutorily Protected Activity
For the reasons discussed above, the undersigned finds that there are triable issues of fact on whether Plaintiff requested a reasonable accommodation when he requested leave [*41]  for his surgery and recovery. Thus, there is a genuine issue of material fact on whether Plaintiff engaged in statutorily protected activity under the ADA when he requested that leave. In addition, Plaintiff has shown that his attorney wrote a letter accusing the City of violating the ADA by failing to put him "back into his former position" and thereby "attempting to terminate [Plaintiff] based on animus towards his disability" (Doc. 66-2 at 4), and that letter was emailed to Bullard on September 28, 2016 (id. at 7).

b. Adverse Employment Action
The Supreme Court has explained that an action is materially adverse in the context of a Title VII retaliation claim if "it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006). Courts in this circuit have applied that same standard to ADA retaliation claims. See Garrison v. City of Tallahassee, 664 Fed. Appx. 823, 827-28 (11th Cir. 2016) (considering whether challenged actions were materially adverse under Burlington standard in evaluating ADA retaliation claim); Holmes v. Fulton Cnty. Sch. Dist., No. 1:06-CV-2556-CC-AJB, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104867, at *111 n.53 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 24, 2007) ("The Court finds that although Burlington dealt with Title VII retaliation cases, the Burlington 'materially adverse' standard also applies to ADA retaliation cases because the text of Title VII's retaliation provision is nearly identical [*42]  to the ADA's retaliation provision." (collecting cases)). The undersigned finds that genuine issues of material fact exist on whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action when the City did not place him back into the full-time shift position that he held before he went on leave, and then placed him in a backup contractor position but never called him into work. A reasonable employee could well be dissuaded from engaging in statutorily protected activity if faced with those consequences.
Defendant contends, however, that Plaintiff cannot show that he suffered and adverse employment action because "Plaintiff cannot point to any evidence whatsoever that the City ended his assignment or that his employment was terminated." (Doc. 57 at 12-13, 19). In spite of the fact that the City did not tell Plaintiff his employment was terminated, a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff's employment with the City was effectively terminated and he therefore suffered an adverse employment action when he went from holding a position with full-time pay to a position where he was never called to work and received no pay.

c. Causal Connection
Defendant did not argue that there was no causal connection [*43]  between Plaintiff's alleged statutorily protected activity and the adverse employment action, but the undersigned notes that Bullard notified CMC of her decision not to place Plaintiff back into his previous full-time position on August 24, 2016 (Doc. 64-2 at 19), only 13 days after Plaintiff notified Bullard and CMC that he had been released back to work effective August 16, 2016 and indicated that he wanted to come back to work following his leave (Def. SMF ¶¶ 43-44; Pl. SMF ¶¶ 145, 147, 149). Moreover, Bullard testified at her deposition about the reasons she did not call Plaintiff in to work as a backup contractor: "I did not call him at that particular time. The schedule was already made. He was scheduled to come on right after that, but then I received the complaint from - I received an e-mail from CMC saying he had rendered a complaint against the City. So . . . ." (Pl SMF ¶ 213; Bullard Dep. 57). Bullard was then asked whether Plaintiff was ever called in to work a holiday or vacation for the backup position, and she replied, "Received the complaint. CMC sent the e-mail saying they received a [discrimination] complaint. So, therefore . . . ." (Pl. SMF ¶ 214; Bullard Dep. 58). [*44]  When asked what she meant by "therefore," Bullard testified that she "went to HR for instructions at that point" and HR "turned it over to the lawyers at that point." (Bullard Dep. 59-60). Bullard testified that she "was waiting on instructions from the lawyer at that point," but no one told her not to schedule Plaintiff for holidays or vacations. (Bullard Dep. 59-60). The undersigned finds that evidence creates an issue of fact on whether the City's decision not to offer Plaintiff any hours in the backup contractor position was causally connected to Plaintiff's statutorily protected activity.
Thus, the undersigned finds that there are issues of fact on each element of Plaintiff's prima facie case of retaliation for purposes of summary judgment.

2. The City's Articulated Reasons For Its Decisions
The employer's burden to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its employment decisions is one of production, not persuasion. Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., 161 F.3d 1318, 1331 (11th Cir. 1998). This burden is "exceedingly light." Turnes v. Amsouth Bank, N.A., 36 F.3d 1057, 1060-61 (11th Cir. 1994) (internal quotation omitted). In this case, there are two employment decisions at issue: (1) Bullard's decision to not put Plaintiff back into his previously held full-time shift position when he returned from leave, [*45]  and (2) her decision not to call him back to work as a backup contractor. Relying on Bullard's Declaration testimony, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was not placed in the full-time shift position he held prior to going out on leave because: Bullard "understood" that CMC had granted Plaintiff "an indefinite leave of absence," but the City "needed an additional CMC employee to begin working immediately and could not hold Plaintiff's assignment open indefinitely," so when Plaintiff was ready to return in August 2016, "the City did not have a full-time, vacant assignment into which Plaintiff could have been placed," and therefore "he was offered the 'back up support contractor' position because the Data Center was fully staffed and had no need to fill a full-time assignment." (Doc. 57 at 13-14; see also Bullard Decl., Doc. 57-1 at 259-264, ¶¶ 14-15, 23-24). As to why Bullard never called Plaintiff back to work as the backup contractor, Defendant asserts that Bullard did not learn until September 13, 2016 that Plaintiff had accepted the contractor position, "[t]he City did not observe another holiday until Veterans Day on Friday, November 11, 2016, and had no need for Plaintiff to work [*46]  in the 'backup support contractor' assignment prior to that time." (Doc. 57 at 14; see also Bullard Decl., ¶¶ 19, 25).
The undersigned will assume for the sake of discussion that Defendant has articulated a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for not placing Plaintiff back in his previously held position and that it has articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for not calling Plaintiff back to work as a backup contractor, at least until November 11, 2016.9 For the reasons discussed below, however, genuine issues of material fact exist to be tried on whether Defendant's reasons are pretextual.

3. Pretext
Because Defendant has (arguably) articulated legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for its employment decisions, to survive summary judgment, Plaintiff must "come forward with evidence, including the previously produced evidence establishing the prima facie case, sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision." Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, Meadowcraft, Inc., 106 F.3d 1519, 1528 (11th Cir. 1997)). The court's role at this juncture is to "evaluate whether the plaintiff has demonstrated such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, [*47]  incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Combs, 106 F.3d at 1538 (internal quotation omitted). In making the required pretext showing, "[a] plaintiff is not allowed to recast an employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons or substitute his business judgment for that of the employer." Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1030. Rather, "[p]rovided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason." Id.

a. The City's Decision Not To Restore Plaintiff To Position
As set forth above, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was not placed in the fulltime shift position he held prior to going out on leave because: Bullard "understood" that CMC had granted Plaintiff "an indefinite leave of absence," but the City "needed an additional CMC employee to begin working immediately and could not hold Plaintiff's assignment open indefinitely," so when Plaintiff was ready to return in August 2016, "the City did not have a full-time, vacant assignment into which Plaintiff could have been [*48]  placed," and therefore "he was offered the 'back up support contractor' position because the Data Center was fully staffed and had no need to fill a full-time assignment." (Doc. 57 at 13-14; see also Bullard Decl., ¶¶ 14-15, 23-24). There are unresolved issues of material fact surrounding each of these assertions.
In the first place, the record contains evidence that Bullard understood that Kenneth Dunbar was assigned to fill-in for Plaintiff while he was on "medical leave" on a "temporary," "short-term" basis. (Doc. 57-1 at 270; Rivera Dep. 29-30; Bullard Dep. 52-53). There is also evidence that although Plaintiff went out on leave on June 20, 2016, Dunbar did not begin working at the Data Center until the week of July 18, 2016. (Doc. 66-2 at 64). Moreover, Plaintiff has shown that he informed Bullard on July 7, 2016 that he anticipated returning to work after his August 11th doctor's visit (Doc. 63-2 at 30), and he made the same report to her on August 1, 2016 (Doc. 63-2 at 23). Thus, Defendant's rationale that it "could not hold Plaintiff's assignment open indefinitely" is in dispute as there is evidence that—viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff—creates an issue of fact [*49]  on whether Bullard actually believed that Plaintiff's leave was indefinite. The above-cited evidence also calls into question the City's assertion that when Plaintiff returned in August 2016 "the City did not have a full-time, vacant assignment into which Plaintiff could have been placed." (Doc. 57 at 13). Plaintiff has produced evidence that it was contemplated that he would return to work at the City when he returned from leave and that Dunbar was only there as a temporary contractor while he was on leave. Thus, there is an issue of fact whether Plaintiff's previously held position was a position "into which Plaintiff could have been placed" or whether, as Defendant asserts, "the Data Center was fully staffed and had no need to fill a full-time assignment" (Doc. 57 at 14).

b. The City's Decision Not To Call Plaintiff Into Work
Defendant contends that the City did not call Plaintiff into work after he accepted the backup contractor position because Bullard did not learn that he accepted the position until September 13, 2016, and the City "had no need for Plaintiff to work in the 'backup support contractor' assignment" prior to the City's next observed holiday on Veterans Day, November [*50]  11, 2016 (Bullard Decl., ¶¶ 25, 26). (Doc. 57 at 14). While Bullard's rationale for not calling Plaintiff into work prior to September 13th appears uncontroverted as she was informed on that date that he had accepted the backup contractor position (Doc. 64-2 at 22), it is undisputed that Bullard never called Plaintiff into work as a backup contractor after September 13, 2016. Genuine issues of material fact exist as to why she never called him back to work and whether she did not call him back to work in retaliation for engaging in statutorily protected activity.
In the first place, even if the City had no need for a backup contractor prior to Veterans Day, that reason does not explain why Plaintiff was not called in that day or any day thereafter, whether to fill in on holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, etc.), vacations, or on an as-needed basis as it was contemplated he would work as a backup contractor. (See Bennett Dep. 80; Rivera Dep. 36, 62-64; Doc. 64-2 at 25). To the extent that Defendant asserts that there was never a need to call Plaintiff in as a backup contractor because the City used other contract employees to cover shifts (see Bullard Dep. 31-32), Bullard's [*51]  deposition testimony creates an issue of fact on that point. Counsel asked Bullard whether as the backup contractor, "it would be less than 40 hours a week that he's scheduled to come in; isn't that correct? Most times?" and Bullard responded, "I couldn't say that . . . [b]ecause the constant need in IT" (Bullard Dep. 61), thus at least implying that Plaintiff could have received 40 hours a week due to the "constant need in IT" and also indicating a need for a backup contractor.
Moreover, Bullard's testimony as to why she never called Plaintiff into work as a backup contractor, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, would provide support for a conclusion that the City's articulated reasons for its actions are pretext for retaliation. It is undisputed that on September 28, 2016, Bullard received via email a copy of Plaintiff's attorney's letter accusing the City of violating the ADA by not reinstating him to his former position. (Pl. SMF ¶ 211; Def. SMF ¶ 66; Doc. 66-2 at 4-7). As discussed above, Bullard's deposition testimony indicates that she did not call Plaintiff in to work because she received that letter and she was "waiting on instructions from the lawyer at that point," [*52]  but no instructions were apparently forthcoming, i.e., no one from HR or the City advised Bullard to bring Plaintiff back. (Bullard Dep. 57-60, 67). Thus, Bullard's testimony both calls into question whether the City's failure to call Plaintiff in to work was due to a lack of need for his services and also whether the City did not call him back to work because he had complained about violations of his rights under the ADA.
Because genuine issues of material fact exist to be tried on whether Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff for engaging in statutorily protected activity by not returning him to work after his medical leave, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be DENIED on Plaintiff's ADA retaliatory "termination" claim (part of Count Three).

IV. Plaintiff's FMLA Claims (Counts Seven and Eight)

A. FMLA Interference
In Count Seven, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant interfered with his rights under the FMLA by failing to inform Plaintiff of his FLMA rights once he requested leave for a serious medical condition, by failing to designate any of Plaintiff's leave as FMLA leave, and by replacing "Plaintiff while he was undergoing treatment for a serious medical condition [*53]  of which it was aware," and then terminating him rather than reinstating him to his position. (Doc. 40 ¶¶ 89-92). In response to Defendant's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff only argues that "the City interfered with [his] FMLA rights by not restoring him to the same or an equivalent position." (Doc. 60 at 10). Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff alleged in his Amended Complaint that Defendant interfered with his FMLA rights by failing to inform Plaintiff of his FLMA rights once he requested leave for a serious medical condition and by failing to designate any of Plaintiff's leave as FMLA leave (see Doc. 40 ¶¶ 91-92), he has apparently abandoned those claims.
The FMLA ensures that eligible employees may take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave, during which their employment status is protected, because of, inter alia, "a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D).10 "An employee has the right following FMLA leave 'to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced' or to an equivalent position.'" Martin v. Brevard Cnty. Pub. Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(1)(A)). "The FMLA recognizes two types of claims for [*54]  alleged violations of [29 U.S.C. §§ 2611, et seq.]: interference claims, in which employers burden or outright deny substantive statutory rights to which their employees are entitled, see 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1) (1999), and retaliation claims, in which employers discharge employees for exercising their FMLA right to leave, see id. § 2615(a)(2)." O'Connor v. PCA Family Health Plan, Inc., 200 F.3d 1349, 1352 (11th Cir. 2000) (footnotes omitted). "To establish an interference claim, an employee need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the benefit denied." Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Defendant does not contend that Plaintiff did not have a serious health condition or that Plaintiff was not entitled to leave under the FMLA, and it acknowledges that an eligible employee who takes FMLA leave has the right to be restored to his position or equivalent position. (Doc. 57 at 15). But Defendant argues that "Plaintiff cannot show that the City interfered with his rights under the statute" because as Plaintiff's "secondary employer," it was not required to restore Plaintiff under the facts of this case.11 (Id. at 15-17). FMLA's applicable regulation concerning joint employer coverage under the FMLA explains that "[i]n joint employment relationships, only the primary employer is responsible for [*55]  giving required notices to its employees, providing FMLA leave, and maintenance of health benefits," and "[f]or employees of temporary placement agencies, . . . the placement agency most commonly would be the primary employer." 29 C.F.R. § 825.106(b). That regulation also provides in relevant part:
Job restoration is the primary responsibility of the primary employer. The secondary employer is responsible for accepting the employee returning from FMLA leave in place of the replacement employee if the secondary employer continues to utilize an employee from the temporary placement agency, and the agency chooses to place the employee with the secondary employer.
29 C.F.R. § 825.106(e).
Assuming for the sake of discussion that CMC was Plaintiff's primary employer and Defendant was Plaintiff's secondary employer, it is undisputed that Defendant continued to utilize contractors from CMC, including Dunbar who replaced Plaintiff, thus the first element for requiring Defendant to have accepted Plaintiff after leave is met. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.106(e). Defendant argues, however, that CMC "never requested that Plaintiff return to his previous assignment as a Computer Operator I or that Plaintiff be placed in another assignment with the City working a full-time [*56]  schedule of 40 hours per week." (Doc. 57 at 18). The undersigned finds that genuine issues of material fact exist on whether CMC "cho[se] to place the employee [Plaintiff] with the secondary employer [the City]" when he returned from leave, the second element for imposing the obligation of job restoration on a secondary employer. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.106(e).
In particular, on August 22, 2016, CMC's CEO Sandra Adams sent an email to Bullard in which she wrote, "Alvin Bennett has been cleared to work following his medical leave. Please provide us with instructions as to how you would like to reinstate him to his position. If there are other options available, please let us know." (Pl. SMF ¶ 165; Doc. 64-2 at 16). Adams also testified that she had a conversation with Bullard and "did suggest" putting Plaintiff back in his shift, but "we have to keep in mind that [Bullard] makes the decisions on who she puts where in her department; I don't." (Adams Dep. 85). Moreover, there is evidence that CMC chose to place Plaintiff back with the City because it placed him with the City as a backup Computer Operator I contractor. (See Adams Dep. 53 (asserting that the backup contractor position was "the same position" as [*57]  the position held before Plaintiff's leave because it "was still a [Computer [O]perator [I]"); Bullard Dep. 61 (implying that the backup contractor could have received 40 hours a week due to "constant need in IT")). Thus, there is at least an issue of fact on the second element for imposing an obligation on the secondary employer to accept the employee returning from FMLA, i.e., "the agency chooses to place the employee with the secondary employer."
The facts in this case, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, are therefore distinguishable from those in the Fifth Circuit case relied on by Defendant, Cuellar v. Keppel Amfels, LLC, 731 F.3d 342, 346 (5th Cir. 2013). (Doc. 57 at 16-18). In Cuellar, it was undisputed that "Perma-Temp did not refer Cuellar back to Keppel Amfels or ask Keppel Amfels to reinstate her to the Material Information Clerk position." Id. at 344. The court found that the Keppel Amfels, the secondary employer, "acted within its rights to replace Cuellar temporarily, and had no obligation to reinstate her absent a request from Perma-Temp." 731 F.3d at 347-48 (emphasis added). By contrast in this case, there is evidence in the record that creates and issue of fact on whether CMC chose to place Plaintiff with the City after his leave by referring him back [*58]  to the City, by requesting his reinstatement, and/or by placing him with the City in a backup Computer Operator I contractor position.
Because genuine issues of material fact exist to be tried on whether Defendant interfered with Plaintiff's FMLA rights by not restoring him to his previous position or equivalent position, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be DENIED as to Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim (Count Seven).

B. FMLA Retaliation
In Count Eight, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant terminated him by failing to return him to his position or another similar position in retaliation for engaging in protected activity under the FMLA, i.e., seeking and taking leave for his medical condition. (Doc. 40 ¶¶ 95-98).
The FMLA provides that "[i]t shall be unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this title . . . ." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2). "To establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, an employee must show that (1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity, (2) he suffered an adverse employment decision, and (3) the decision was causally connected to the protected activity." Lee v. United States Steel Corp., 450 Fed. Appx. 834, 838 (11th Cir. 2012) [*59]  (unpublished decision). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its action, at which point plaintiff must present sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact on whether the articulated reason is a pretext for retaliation. See Langford v. MARTA, No. 1:07-CV-2871-TCB-GGB, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135817, at *23-24 (N.D. Ga. July 27, 2009), adopted by 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135808 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 24, 2009).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim fails because Plaintiff never requested leave; "[h]e simply notified the City that he would be undergoing surgery with no indication when he would return to work." (Doc. 57 at 20). Defendant also argues that this claim "likewise fails because Plaintiff cannot show that he suffered an adverse employment action or that the City's legitimate, nonretaliatory reasons for its employment decisions are pretextual," for the same reasons Defendant advanced in seeking summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim discussed above. (Id.). For the reasons set forth above, the undersigned finds that there are genuine issues of material fact concerning Plaintiff's request for leave; on whether he suffered an adverse employment action when he was not restored to his full-time shift position but instead placed in a backup position and never called in to work; and on whether Defendant's articulated reasons for those actions are pretext for retaliation. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be DENIED on Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation [*60]  claim (Count Eight).

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. Specifically, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion be GRANTED on Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim (Count One), his ADA retaliatory failure to promote claim (part of Count Three), and his Rehabilitation Act claims (Counts Four, Five, and Six) because Plaintiff abandoned those claims. It is further RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion be DENIED on Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate and retaliatory "termination" claims (Count Two and part of Count Three) and his FMLA interference and retaliation claims (Counts Seven and Eight).
It is SO REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED this 21st day of January, 2020.
