MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
ALISON J. NATHAN, United States District Judge:
Plaintiff Hyacinth Seivright has filed this action asserting that Defendant Montefiore Medical Center ("Montefiore") unlawfully failed to accommodate her disability and terminated her employment in violation of state and federal law. Specifically, she asserts claims for discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), and New York State and New York City Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL" and "NYCHRL," respectively), and retaliation under the ADA and ADEA. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 45-67). Montefiore moves for summary judgment on all claims.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. Summary Judgment Standard and Acceptable Evidence
Summary judgment is proper only if there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Ramos v. Baldor Specialty Foods, Inc., 687 F.3d 554, 558 (2d Cir. 2012).  [*2] In reviewing the evidence on a motion for summary judgment, courts are to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. Id. A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law and an issue is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Id.
Before discussing the factual record, the parties' submissions prompt the Court to review the appropriate procedure for submitting evidence or attempting to dispute facts in a summary judgment motion. First and foremost, a dispute of fact cannot be manufactured by a conclusory denial that does not point to evidence in the record. See, e.g., Local R. 56.1(d); Lorterdan Props. at Ramapo I, LLC v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc'y of N.Y., Inc., No. 11-cv-3656, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95693, at *2-4 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. July 9, 2012); BOUSA, Inc. v. United States (In re Bulk Oil (USA) Inc.), No. 93-cv-4492, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27346, at *48-50 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 11, 2007). Thus, to the extent that a party has simply baldly asserted that the evidence submitted by the opposing party is "disputed"  [*3] or that they are "unaware" of the facts, this does not create a dispute of fact. (See, e.g., Pls. RSMF ¶¶ 29-31, 40, 48, 50, 53-56); see also Monahan v. New York City Dep't of Corrections, 214 F.3d 275, 291-92 (2d Cir. 2000); 24/7 Records, Inc. v. Sony Music Entm't, Inc., 429 F.3d 39, 46 (2d Cir. 2005) (noting that courts are not required to consider what the parties fail to point out in their 56.1 statements, although they may exercise their discretion to do so); Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co. v. Tri-County Fire & Safety Equip. Co., 636 F. Supp. 2d 193, 197 (E.D.N.Y. 2009).
In a similar vein, the Court's rules provide that parties "should submit only those exhibits necessary to decide the motion and should not submit, for example, entire deposition transcripts" and that "[t]he Court may strike documents that do not comply with these rules." (Individual Rules and Practices in Civil Cases § 3.G). Plaintiff's submission of the Burns deposition in its entirety—in support of an unsupported assertion that Burns was "vague" and "evasive" at her deposition—is in contravention of these rules and is stricken except as to those pages and lines that are specifically cited as evidence. See also Island Software & Computer Serv. v. Microsoft Corp., 413 F.3d 257, 261 (2d Cir. 2005)  [*4] ("Broad, conclusory attacks on the credibility of a witness will not, by themselves, present questions of material fact.").

B. Facts
The following facts are undisputed, except as otherwise noted.1 Montefiore is a nonprofit medical center that maintains a healthcare management company, CMO, as a wholly-owned subsidiary. (SMF ¶¶ 1, 3; RSMF ¶¶ 1, 3; Burns Decl. ¶¶ 2, 4). Starting in December 1967, Montefiore employed Seivright as a Registered Nurse ("RN"). (SMF ¶ 4; RSMF ¶ 4; Am. Compl. ¶ 17; Burns Decl. ¶ 5). In 2004, Sevright began working for CMO as a Medical Management Clinical Coordinator, until she experienced an injury and took medical leave from January 16, 2008, through June 22, 2009. (SMF ¶¶ 5-6; RSMF ¶¶ 5-6; Burns Decl. ¶¶ 6-7).
When Seivright returned from leave, she was assigned a position as a Care Management Coordinator, which required that she, among other things, review medical records and participate in performance improvement projects to improve documentation efforts. (SMF ¶ 7, 9; RSMF ¶¶ 7, 9; Burns Decl. ¶ 8; Seivright Dep. 34:9-12, 42:11-44:15 & Ex. 5). This job required such physical tasks as walking, standing, bending, lifting up charts, reaching for charts, pulling a computer bag, and walking while pulling a computer on a cart or bag at least twice a day for twenty minutes. (SMF ¶ 10; RSMF ¶ 10; Seivright Dep. 36:2-40:7, 45:10-46:2).
Throughout her employment at Montefiore, Seivright was a member of the New York State Nursing Association ("NYSNA") and her employment was governed by a collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") between the NYSNA and Montefiore. (SMF ¶¶ 11-12; RSMF ¶¶ 11-12; Seivright Dep. 33:10-33:13, 34:4-34:15 & Ex. 4). Although no contractual claim is asserted in this litigation, a review of the provisions of the CBA is important to understanding the actions taken by Seivright's superiors and some of Seivright's arguments that her termination  [*6] was unlawful. Specifically, the CBA allowed Seivright to take up to nine months of leave for personal illness and provided that employees (like Seivright) with ten or more years of service were entitled to take up to six months of leave for a job-related illness or injury while still being "entitled to return to the same position, unit, title and shift as he/she held prior to taking leave." (SMF ¶¶ 12-15; RSMF ¶¶ 12-15; Seivright Dep. Ex. 4 at 33-34). The CBA further provided that
[a]n employee requesting a leave of more than eight (8) weeks but not greater than six (6) months will be allowed to return to the same position, unit, title and shift without previously accrued seniority if at the time of the leave, or not later than eight (8) weeks from that date, the Director of Nursing is able to provide for temporary replacement. If no temporary replacement can be obtained, the employee retains the right at the end of the leave to return to the first (1st) available opening in the same job title and shift.
(SMF ¶¶ 12-15; RSMF ¶¶ 12-15; Seivright Dep. Ex. 4 at 33-34). On September 24, 2009, Plaintiff suffered injuries at work in which she fractured a metatarsal in her right foot and sustained  [*7] injuries to her neck, back, shoulder, and right hip, prompting her to take medical leave on that day. (SMF ¶¶ 16-17; RSMF ¶¶ 16-17; Seivright Dep. 55:10-56:2).
On December 1, 2009, Burns sent Seivright a letter citing to the CBA and stating that "[i]t has been more than eight weeks since the start of your leave and the Director of Nursing has not been able to provide for temporary replacement. Therefore, in accordance with Section 8.02, if you return to work on or before March 24, 2010, you will be entitled to the first (1st) available opening in your job title — Care Management Coordinator — and shift." (SMF ¶¶ 18-19; Burns Decl. ¶¶ 9-10, Ex. C). On March 11, 2009, Burns followed up on this letter, reminding her that her right to return to the first available opening in her job title ended on March 24, 2010 and that if she returned after this date but before June 24, 2010, when her nine months of permissible leave ran out, she would need to apply for open positions. (SMF ¶ 21-23; RSMF ¶ 21-23; Burns Decl. ¶ 11, Ex. D; Seivright Dep. 81:3-82:14 & Ex. 9).

1. Attempts to Determine Seivright's Medical Restrictions
Although Seivright visited her physician, Dr. Palmeri on at least March 10,  [*8] 2014, at which time she was assessed as "temporarily totally disabled" (SMF ¶ 20; RSMF ¶ 20; Seivright Dep. Ex. 7), neither Seivright nor her doctor communicated to Montefiore that she could return to work in any capacity until March 24, 2010. (SMF ¶¶ 20, 25; RSMF ¶¶ 20, 25; Burns Decl. ¶ 12; cf. Seivright Dep. 80:19-25). On this day, Seivright visited Dr. Palmeri and then provided Montefiore's Occupational and Health Services office a note from Dr. Palmeri stating that she could return to work with the following restrictions: "no excessive pushing, pulling, walking or standing" and that she should be "allowed time for positional changes and be provided with an ergonomically suitable chair and desk." (SMF ¶¶ 26-27; RSMF ¶¶ 26-27; Seivright Dep. Ex. 8).
On March 25, 2010, Burns sent a letter to Dr. Palmeri asking for further detail regarding Seivright's restrictions, including the percentage of time that would be excessive for pushing, pulling, walking, or standing; how much time would be needed for positional changes; and what would be "ergonomically suitable."2 (SMF ¶¶ 29-30; RSMF ¶¶ 29-30; Burns Decl. ¶ 14 & Ex. F). She further advised Dr. Palmeri that Seivright would be unable to  [*9] return to work until Montefiore received this information. (SMF ¶ 31; RSMF ¶ 31; Burns Decl. ¶ 15 & Ex. F). Kennedy also reported to Burns on March 25, 2010, that the position Seivright left for medical leave required her to stand roughly 90 minutes per day to speak to members of the health care team; walk at least 180 minutes per day; and pull a rolling bag with a computer and reference books roughly 60 minutes per day. (CSMF ¶ 4; RCSMF ¶ 4; Burns Aug. Decl. Ex. A).
No response to Burns's March 25, 2010 letter was forthcoming, so on April 19, 2010, Burns sent a letter to Dr. Palmeri requesting that he respond to her March 25, 2010 letter and further wrote to Seivright with a copy of the March 25, 2010 letter and asked her to reach out to Dr. Palmeri. (SMF ¶¶ 32-33; RSMF ¶¶ 32-33; Burns Decl. ¶¶ 16-17 & Ex. G & H; Seivright Dep. 90:11-91:11). This letter also noted that Burns had attempted  [*10] to speak with Seivright about this issue on March 25, 2010, but had been unable to reach her as Seivright's voicemail was full, and had therefore reached out to Seivright's union representative to attempt to contact her. (SMF ¶ 34; RSMF ¶ 34; Burns Decl. Ex. H).
On May 3, 2010, Dr. Palmeri submitted a note to Montefiore which stated "No work until formal dictation is ready on 5/10/10" but that did not address Burns's questions or further address Seivright's work restrictions. (SMF ¶¶ 36-37; RSMF ¶¶ 36-37; Seivright Dep. 92:9-93:16 & Ex, 13). Finally, on May 18, 2010, Palmeri responded to Burns's letter and specified that Seivright had the following restrictions:
Sedentary position where she is required to stand for no more than 5 minute intervals for less than 1 hour per 7 1/2 hour work day. The patient should also be allowed to change positions as she sees fit. She should avoid pulling or pulling [sic] of computers or charts. She can lift one chart on a regular basis and should be provided with a desk space with an ergonomically supported chair. She should avoid walking greater than five minute intervals for less than one hour daily.
(SMF ¶¶ 38; RSMF ¶ 38; Burns Decl. ¶ 19 & Ex. J).

2.  [*11] Seivright's Review of Job Postings
On or about May 18, 2010, Seivright was cleared to return to work but did not return to her previous position as Care Management Coordinator. (SMF ¶ 39; CSMF ¶ 19; RCSMF ¶ 19; Burns Decl. ¶ 20). Instead, she was instructed to meet with Janet Hunter at human resources on a weekly basis to search Montefiore job listings to identify positions she was interested in. (SMF ¶ 42; RSMF ¶ 42; CSMF ¶ 19; RCSMF ¶ 19; Seivright Dep. 108:21-109:25; Chin Dep. 56:9-59:18). The evidence reflects that Hunter's job responsibilities included assisting employees find alternate duties within the medical center, but the evidence suggests she did not typically work with RNs and that Seivright was the only RN she worked with in a displacement or alternate duty meeting. (CSMF ¶ 19; RCSMF ¶ 19; Chin Dep. 58:6-59:18; Seivright Dep. 109:6-13).
In addition to her medical restrictions, Seivright's search for a position was constrained by two further limitations. First, she was unwilling to accept any position other than an RN position that was covered by the NYSNA. (SMF ¶ 40; RSMF ¶ 40; Seivright Dep. 106:10-107:6). Second, she refused to take any job that would have entailed taking  [*12] a pay cut. (SMF ¶ 40; RSMF ¶ 40; Seivright Dep. 106:10-107:6).
At Seivright's first meeting with Hunter on May 25, 2010, the two of them reviewed the RN job postings but Seivright did not identify any jobs she wished to pursue. (SMF ¶ 43-44; RSMF ¶ 42-43; Seivright Dep. 112:9-114:4 & Ex. 16). The next week, on June 1, 2010, they again met—this time with Mike Hertz, Seivright's union representative in attendance—but Seivright again did not identify any NYSNA, RN jobs that met her medical restrictions. (SMF ¶¶ 45-47; RSMF ¶¶ 44-46; Seivright Dep. 114:11-115:11).3 These meetings continued on a weekly basis, with one or two exceptions, for five months until October 21, 2010, when Plaintiff was terminated through a letter noting that she had used three months more than the permissible nine months of medical leave and had not identified a position to which she would return. (SMF ¶¶ 72-74; RSMF ¶¶ 71-73; CSMF ¶ 21; RCSMF ¶ 21;Seivright Dep. 144:17-145:6 & Ex. 21).

3. Communications Regarding Seivright's Medical Leave and Job Search
Throughout Seivright's leave, discussions occurred as to how to address her absence and how long to hold her position. On October 28, 2009, in an e-mail chain discussing Seivright's failure to deliver a note she had been provided to report her status to Montefiore, Ann-Marie Carducci asked Burns whether there was "any recourse that she didn't provide her manager with the . . . note? Isn't there a policy that says the employee must notify their manager weekly re: a return to work date??? We're holding this position, which is clearly non-productive, and the department is at a deficit." (CSMF ¶ 10; RCSMF ¶ 10; Chin Dep. Ex. 29). Burns responded that Seivright should be in contact and was aware of the policy, and that Montefiore was "obligated to hold the position for a certain amount of time and she is within those limits." (Chin Dep. Ex. 20).
In a November 17, 2009, e-mail between Elizabeth Burns (CMO's Human Resources Business Partner), Elizabeth Kennedy, and Nerissa Chin (Director of Human Resources), Kennedy inquired as to how long they were required  [*14] to hold Seivright's position. (CSMF ¶ 9, 13; RCSMF ¶ 9, 13; Chin Dep. Ex. 28). Burns responded "I believe that current position needs to be held for 6 months due to her time of service 10+ years. With what's going on with her I hear it in my sleep." (CSMF ¶ 9; RCSMF ¶ 9; Chin Dep. Ex. 28). Burns has attested that this was a reference to Seivright's ongoing arbitration hearing concerning her previous leave of absence, which concerned, in part, the duration under the CBA that Seivright's position must be held open. (Burns Aug. Decl. ¶ 2; see also Schmidt Decl. Ex. D at 2-6). Similarly, on November 19, 2009, Chin sent an e-mail discussing how long Seivright was entitled to retain her position, suggesting that they were obligated to hold it for eight weeks, after which Seivright would be entitled to the first available opening in the same job title and shift. (CSMF ¶ 13; RCSMF ¶ 13; Chin Dep. Ex. 20).
On February 9, 2010, Burns and Carducci received an e-mail from Barbara Lowenthal to discuss issuing an "RFP" for Seivright to seek a temporary replacement to fill her position. In response, Burns noted that the CBA allowed them to fill the position on a permanent basis, to which Lowenthal  [*15] responded that "budget won't approve it as long as she is still in the staff roster for the department." Burns responded that this was an "extenuating circumstance" and that the budget department could contact her for details if necessary. (Chin Dep. Ex. 30).
On March 24, 2010, the day that Seivright first communicated her restrictions to Montefiore, Burns and Kennedy discussed Seivright's return via an e-mail in which Kennedy noted that they retained an open position for Seivright, to which Burns responded that they "will need to know the exact restrictions" Seivright faced. (CSMF ¶ 4; RCSMF ¶ 4; Chin Dep. Ex. 12). Burns also e-mailed Jackie Van Pelt, requesting that she "keep your eye open for sedentary positions [for Seivright] because I am not certain if we can accommodate her in her current position." (CSMF ¶ 3; RCSMF ¶ 3; Chin Dep. Ex. 13).
On March 26, 2010, in an e-mail discussion about the expiration of Seivright's RN license registration, Carducci noted that she was "not even clear if [Seivright] still works in my department because we would have replaced her already if we had a suitable candidate!!" (CSMF ¶ 11; RCSMF ¶ 11; Chin Dep. Ex. 16). On April 23, 2010, Carducci wrote  [*16] to Nerissa Chin noting that "since Beth [Kennedy] has filled her vacancies, IF Hyacinth is ever approve [sic] to return, Beth will have to refer her to HR. Agree?" (CSMF ¶ 8, RCSMF ¶ 8; Chin Dep. Ex. 24). Chin agreed with this assessment. (CSMF ¶ 8, RCSMF ¶ 8; Chin Dep. Ex. 24).

II. ANALYSIS

A. Disability Discrimination and Failure to Accommodate Under the ADA
Montefiore moves for summary judgment on Seivright's claims for disability discrimination and failure to accommodate under the ADA.4 Claims for disability discrimination under the ADA are evaluated under the three-step analysis set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). "A plaintiff must establish a prima facie case; the employer must offer through the introduction of admissible evidence a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the discharge; and the plaintiff must then produce evidence and carry the burden of persuasion that the proffered reason is a pretext." McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009) (quotation marks omitted).
To make out a prima facie case where a plaintiff's claim rests on an  [*17] alleged failure to reasonably accommodate a disability, the plaintiff must show the following:
(1) plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA;
(2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations.
Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006) (quotation marks omitted). Montefiore's motion for summary judgment focuses on the third and fourth elements of the prima facie case.

1. Initial Considerations
At the outset, the Court addresses two of Seivright's arguments that are easily disposed of. First, Seivright argues that Montefiore failed to engage in an interactive process with her in order to determine whether her disability could be reasonably accommodated. Specifically, she claims that Montefiore unilaterally determined her "functional limitations" and "removed . . . [her] job from consideration" requiring her to meet with Hunter to review job listings meeting her interests, qualifications, and limitations. (Opp. at 14). She argues that this, in and of itself, renders  [*18] Montefiore liable. (Opp. at 13).
The Second Circuit has expressly held that that "failure to engage in an interactive process does not form the basis of an ADA claim in the absence of evidence that accommodation was possible." McBride, 583 F.3d at 100; see also id. at 101 ("The employer's failure to engage in such an interactive process, however, does not relieve a plaintiff of her burden of demonstrating, following discovery, that some accommodation of her disability was possible."); Noll v. IBM, No. 12-cv-6239, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136519, at *12-13 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2013). Thus, even assuming that Montefiore did not engage in a sufficient interactive process with Seivright, Seivright must still show that Montefiore denied her a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job.
Second, Seivright makes two related arguments that boil down to a claim that Montefiore should have held her job at CMO as a Care Management Coordinator open until she was able to return to that position, and that the failure to do so was a denial of a reasonable accommodation. (Opp. at 14-16). Likewise, she asserts that "despite its obligation to do so under  [*19] the [CBA], [Montefiore] never attempted to engage a temporary replacement for [Seivright] during her absence from her CMO position" which "would have afforded the plaintiff the opportunity to benefit from the interactive process, and possibly retain her position, with appropriate reasonable accommodations."5 (Opp. at 17). The core assumption of both of these claims, however, is that Seivright was capable doing the job she that she held prior to her medical leave. Thus, for these arguments to have any traction there must be sufficient record evidence to make out a prima facie case that Seivright could have performed the essential functions of the Care Management Coordinator job with some reasonable accommodation.

2. There Is No Record Evidence of Any Accommodation that Would Have Allowed Seivright to Perform the Care Management Coordinator Job
Seivright argues that Montefiore should have provided her a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of the Care Management Coordinator position, but instead it "did not consider any accommodation to [that] position, and did not engage in any analysis of whether any such accommodation would impose an undue hardship." (Opp. at 16). In support, Seivright argues that the essential functions of the Care Management Coordinator position were to "work[ ] with providers to improve coding, review medical records and identify document improvement opportunities." (Opp. at 17). There does not appear to be any dispute that the essential function of this position included "reviewing medical records to identify documentation improvement opportunities and to ensure appropriate diagnosis codes were assigned; and participating in performance improvement (PI) projects designed to improve documentation efforts." (See, e.g., SMF ¶ 9; RSMF ¶¶ 9; see also Seivright  [*21] Dep. 34:9-12, 42:11-44:15 & Ex. 5). See McBride, 583 F.3d at 98 ("Although the term 'essential functions' is not defined by the ADA, regulations promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ('EEOC') indicate that it encompasses 'the fundamental job duties of the employment position.'" (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1))).
The unrebutted evidence establishes that, at least as the Care Management Coordinator position was structured at the time, Seivright would have been unable to perform those functions based on the amount of standing, walking, and pushing or pulling of heavy objects required. (SMF ¶¶ 10, 26-27, 38; RSMF ¶¶ 10, 26-27, 38; CSMF ¶ 4; RCSMF ¶ 4; Burns Decl. ¶ 19 & Ex. J; Burns Aug. Decl. Ex. A; Seivright Dep. 36:2-40:7, 45:10-46:2, 240:9-241:5 & Ex. 8 at 1, 8). Thus, the Court turns to whether there is any evidence in the record that suggests that Seivright could have performed the functions of this position with a reasonable accommodation.
"When a plaintiff brings an action alleging that a defendant violated the ADA by failing to offer a reasonable accommodation, the claim fails unless the plaintiff establishes that an effective accommodation existed that would  [*22] render her otherwise qualified." Jackan v. New York State DOL, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000) (quotation marks omitted); D'Amico v. City of New York, 132 F.3d 145, 151 (2d Cir. 1998) ("A plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that he can perform the essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation or no accommodation."). This burden is not a heavy one; it is enough for the plaintiff to suggest the existence of a plausible accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits. Kennedy v. Dresser Rand Co., 193 F.3d 120, 123 (2d Cir. 1999); Goonan v. FRB of N.Y., No. 12-cv-3859, 916 F. Supp. 2d 470, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3764, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). If the plaintiff carries this burden, the defendant bears the burden of establishing the proposed accommodation is unreasonable—i.e., that it would cause the defendant to suffer an undue hardship. Goonan, 916 F. Supp. 2d 470, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3764, at *18-19.
However, mere speculation does not suffice to show that an accommodation would allow an employee to perform the duties of her position. Jackan, 205 F.3d at 567 ("[A]n employee with a severe motor disorder could not successfully carry her burden of persuasion by asserting that  [*23] she would have been qualified to perform the duties of her position with the assistance of a mechanical device that compensates for her disorder. She would need to demonstrate that such a device existed and was available to her employer."). Rather, to survive summary judgment there must be evidence in the record that is at least sufficient to create a genuine dispute of fact that the claimed accommodation would have enabled the plaintiff to perform the position's essential functions. See, e.g., Wega v. Ctr. for Disability Rights, Inc., 395 Fed. Appx. 782, 784 (2d Cir. October 8, 2010) (unpublished) ("[E]ven on appeal, [Appellant] provides no evidence that any accommodation would have enabled him to perform his job adequately."); McBride, 583 F.3d at 102-03 (plaintiff did not make a sufficient showing that she could have performed the essential functions of either her pre-disability position or any other position to which she could have been reassigned); Jackan, 205 F.3d at 567 (explaining that the precedent stating that the plaintiff need only suggest a plausible accommodation was referring to the reasonableness of the accommodation, not whether such an accommodation exists); Mines v. City of New York/DHS, No. 11-cv-7886, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157782, at *33, *35 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 1, 2013) [*24]  ("The plaintiff must provide evidence that there was some form of accommodation that would have allowed her to continue working and that her employer refused to provide such an accommodation."); Cheshire v. Paulson, No. 04-cv-3884, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42633, at *18 (E.D.N.Y. June 12, 2007) (granting summary judgment because the record did not contain sufficient evidence that the requested accommodations would have permitted the plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her job).
Seivright's only effort to satisfy this burden to propose an accommodation is to argue in her brief, without citation to any evidence, that "the defendant could provide proper seating, and a motorized cart to transport her equipment, or otherwise accommodate plaintiff in her journey to the patient floor." (Opp. at 17). This statement, however, is mere attorney argument that holds no evidentiary value. See, e.g., Kulhawik v. Holder, 571 F.3d 296, 298 (2d Cir. 2009) ("An attorney's unsworn statements in a brief are not evidence."); Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 554 (2d Cir. 2005) (nonmoving  [*25] parties in summary judgment may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation and must offer some hard evidence); Hughes Contr. Indus., Inc. v. Reliance Constr. of Canada, No. 08-cv-10075, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90742, at *28-29 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2010) (attorney affidavit not based on personal knowledge or supported by admissible evidence is insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion).
The Court has thoroughly reviewed the record and finds an absence of any actual evidence that this accommodation would have allowed Seivright to perform the functions of Care Management Coordinator. For example, there is no testimony or declaration—whether from Seivright herself, a doctor, or any other source—that the accommodations proposed in Seivright's brief would have permitted her to perform her essential job functions. To the contrary, the record suggests that the amount of standing, walking, and moving of heavy objects required by this position greatly exceeds the amount that Seivright was physically capable of performing (see, e.g., CSMF ¶ 4; RCSMF ¶ 4; Burns Aug. Decl. Ex. A) and the record permits only speculation as to whether this activity was integral to the position.  [*26] In fact, the record establishes that this position required her to work on different floors and in different buildings on a day-to-day basis, to retrieve patient charts from various locations, and move other heavy objects such as a computer and reference books, such that a fixed seating location or motorized cart would not necessarily have eliminated the substantial physical effort that the position required. (See Seivright Dep. 36:2-37:18; 38:3-39:25 & Ex. 5 at 1, 8 (job description noting "[e]xtensive interaction with providers at all levels is a large part of this position" and that "[t]ravel between the department's offices [is] required"). Put differently, although Seivright has proposed a hypothetical accommodation, the record is devoid of proof that the Care Management Coordinator position could, in fact, have been performed without the standing, walking, or moving of charts or other heavy objects that is otherwise required.
Finally, the only evidence in the record reflects that Seivright herself did not believe she could have performed the Care Management Coordinator role. Despite her supervisor's requests for information about her medical restrictions, Seivright never suggested  [*27] that she believed that she would be able to perform Care Management Coordinator position with any accommodation. (Seivright Dep. 148:7-149:2). Although a request for a particular accommodation is not a prerequisite to the employer's obligation to provide reasonable accommodations where a disability is known, see McBride, 583 F.3d at 102, the failure to make such a request under the circumstances of this case corroborates the evidence of the unsuitability of the proposed accommodation. See, e.g., Graves, 457 F.3d at 184 ("Graves never requested such an unpaid leave of absence in January 2001. This request would matter because, generally, it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed."); Petrone v. Hampton Bays Union Free Sch. Dist., No. 03-cv-4359, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97292, at *83-84 (E.D.N.Y. July 10, 2013). Likewise, when such a position was open at Montefiore during Seivright's review of job postings, she did not select it as a position in which she was interested. (Burns Decl. Ex. K). Indeed, even at her deposition, she did not identify the Care Management Coordinator position as one that she believed she could  [*28] perform, given her restrictions. (SMF ¶¶ 50, 52, 60, 64; RSMF ¶¶ 49, 51, 59, 63; Seivright Dep. 98:8-102:21, 107:25-108:5, 116:10-117:14, 119:2-121:12, 143:9-144:7, 239:8-16, 240:9-241:5).

3. Seivright's Failure to Secure Another Position
Seivright's opposition to summary judgment fails to present any argument that she was denied a reasonable accommodation as to any other position at Montefiore (Opp. at 14, 16), and Seivright has therefore waived any such argument. See Becnel v. Deutsche Bank, AG, 507 Fed. Appx. 71, 72 (2d Cir. Jan 11, 2013) (unpublished); Globalnet Financial.com, Inc. v. Frank Crystal & Co., 449 F.3d 377, 385 (2d Cir. 2006). In the alternative, the record and the governing law show that Seivright could not sustain such a claim.
A plaintiff suggesting that reassignment would have been a reasonable accommodation "must demonstrate the existence, at or around the time when accommodation was sought, of an existing vacant position to which she could have been reassigned." McBride, 583 F.3d at 97-98. An employer is not under an obligation to reassign an employee if no position is vacant, nor is an employer obligated to create a new position to accommodate the employee or find  [*29] a position for that employee. See Thompson v. N.Y. City Dep't of Prob., 348 Fed. Appx. 643, 645 (2d Cir. Oct. 8, 2009); Norville v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 196 F.3d 89, 99 (2d Cir. 1999). The plaintiff must have been qualified for the position and the position cannot be one such that reassignment would have required a promotion. McBride, 583 F.3d at 98. The undisputed evidence establishes that all of the positions that Seivright reviewed were inappropriate for one reason or another: either they did not meet her requirement that they be NYSNA positions that did not entail a pay cut or they were management positions. (SMF ¶¶ 50-71; RSMF ¶¶ 49-70; Seivright Dep. 96:19-102:6, 107:17-108:5, 116:10-121:13, 141L4-144:11, 239:8-18). Seivright has not even argued, let alone presented evidence that creates a dispute of fact, that any of these positions could have been modified to meet her specifications by, for example, converting a nonunion position into a union position. See, e.g., Kennedy, 193 F.3d at 122-23.

B. Age Discrimination
Montefiore has also moved for summary judgment on Seivright's claims of age discrimination. (Am. Compl. at 9-11). Seivright has not responded to Montefiore's arguments  [*30] in her opposition to the summary judgment motion and has not argued that summary judgment should not be granted. The Court therefore finds this claim has been abandoned. See Zadrowski v. Town of Plainville, No. 09-cv-1367, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140396, at *25-26 (D. Conn. Sept. 30, 2013); Urquhart v. Metro. Transp. Auth., No. 07-cv-3561, 975 F. Supp. 2d 320, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142519, at *18 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2013); Kolenovic v. ABM Janitorial Northeast Inc., No. 08-cv-067, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7798, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2009).
In the alternative, even assessed on the merits, Seivright's age discrimination claims fails because she has not set forth a prima facie case of age discrimination. See Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 106 (2d Cir. 2010) (discussing three-step burden shifting analysis of such claims); see also Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., 557 U.S. 167, 177, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009) (requiring an ADEA plaintiff show that age was the "but for" cause of her termination); Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., 584 F.3d 487, 498 n.1 (2d Cir. 2009) (noting that age discrimination claims under NYSHRL are evaluated under the same three-step rubric as ADEA claims); Mounir Semaan Najjar v. Mirecki, No. 11-cv-5138, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94011, at *22-23 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2013) [*31]  (NYCHRL requires a mixed-motive analysis and claims must be evaluated independently of federal statutes). In this case, the only evidence even arguably suggestive of age-based animus are the statements of a few individuals—none of them decision-makers, none involved in Seivright's termination, and some of them not even identified—suggesting that Seivright consider retiring. (SMF ¶¶ 80-89; RSMF ¶ 79-88; Seivright Dep. 148:22-150:14, 163:5-165:7, 172:12-173:22, 247:25-251:9; 254:5-255:13; Burns Decl. ¶ 29). Such stray remarks are not sufficient to withstand summary judgment, whether under the ADEA, the NYSHRL, or the more liberal standards of the NYCHRL, which the Court considers separately. Danzer v. Norden, 151 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir. 1998) ("[S]tray remarks, even if made by a decisionmaker, . . . without more, cannot get a discrimination suit to a jury.") (citation omitted); Ugactz v. UPS, Inc., No. 10-cv-1247, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43481, at *61 n. 29 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2013); Payne v. N.Y. City Police Dep't, No. 08-cv-3993, 863 F. Supp. 2d 169, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43031, at *35 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2012) (stray remarks are insufficient to make  [*32] out a claim of discrimination absent other indicia of discrimination); Jowers v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., No. 09-cv-2620, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91581, at *9-10 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 16, 2010) (explaining that stray remarks cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination and that there must be a direct link between the plaintiff's membership in a protected class and an adverse employment action in order to infer discriminatory animus); cf. Tomassi v. Insignia Fin. Group, Inc., 478 F.3d 111, 115 (2d Cir. 2007).

C. Retaliation
As her third cause of action, Seivright asserts claims for retaliation under the ADA and ADEA. She claims that Montefiore's actions in refusing to accommodate her and terminating her employment were retaliation for one or more of the following actions: an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charge she filed in 2008; a 2010 settlement of a previously filed disability lawsuit in Bronx Supreme Court; and the arbitration proceedings between Seivright and Montefiore's regarding her return from her previous medical leave.6 (Opp. at 21; Am. Compl. ¶ 59; SMF ¶¶ 90-94; RSMF ¶¶ 89-93; Seivright Dep. 169:12-170:25
Retaliation claims under the ADA and ADEA are subject to the same burden-shifting framework under McDonnell Douglas as discussed above.7 See Kessler v. Westchester County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 461 F.3d 199, 205 (2d Cir. 2006); Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. 2002); see also Ben-Levy v. Bloomberg, 518 Fed. Appx. 17, 19 (2d Cir. May 1, 2013) (unpublished). To make out a prima facie case of retaliation under these statutes, a plaintiff must show (1) that she engaged in a protected activity under the ADA or ADEA; (2) the employer was aware of this activity; (3) the employer took adverse employment action against her; and (4) a causal connection exists between the alleged adverse action and the protected activity. Kessler, 461 F.3d at 205;  [*34] Treglia, 313 F.3d at 719.
The Court concludes that Seivright has not made out a prima facie case of retaliation. At the outset, the Court notes that as far as the arbitration proceeding is concerned, it does not appear to have been a protected activity under the ADA or ADEA. Although Plaintiff's counsel attempts to characterize it as grieving "discriminatory practices," based on the arbitrator's decision this proceeding related to an alleged violation of the collective bargaining agreement rather than a claim of disability or age discrimination. (Schmidt Decl. Ex. D); See 42 U.S.C. § 12203 (ADA anti-retaliation provision); 29 U.S.C. § 623(d) (ADEA anti-retaliation provision); Melie v. EVCI/TCI College Admin., No. 08-cv-5226, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42849, at *32-33 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2009)  [*35] (union grievance did not constitute a protected activity under Title VII); Lewis v. Conn. Dep't of Corr., 355 F. Supp. 2d 607, 617 (D. Conn. 2005); Vital v. Interfaith Med. Ctr., No. 96-cv-363, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11554, at *20-21 (E.D.N.Y. July 31, 2001); Gonzalez v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., No. 00-cv-4293, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5908, at *71-72 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2001).
Regardless, even assuming that the arbitration proceeding related to a discrimination claim, the Court finds that Seivright has failed to submit sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of fact as to whether there was a causal connection between her protected activities and any alleged retaliation. First, as to Seivright's 2008 EEOC complaint and 2010 settlement, there is no evidence that any of the individuals involved in her attempted return to Montefiore or termination knew that she had engaged in any of the listed protected activities. See, e.g., Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) ("First, there is no indication that Rice even knew about the right-to-sue letter when she proposed transferring respondent."); Davis v. Peake, No. 08-cv-3570, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107380, at *26 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2011)  [*36] (no causal connection where there was no evidence the decision-makers were aware of the protected activity). Although the Second Circuit has made clear that it is not necessary that particular individuals know of the protected activities at issue to satisfy the second element of the retaliation analysis, see Gordon v. New York City Bd. of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 116 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that general corporate knowledge may suffice); see also Kessler, 461 F.3d at 210 (applying Gordon to the fourth element of causal connection), it is equally clear that such lack of knowledge by decision-makers undercuts a claim of a causal connection. See Gordon, 232 F.3d at 117 ("The lack of knowledge on the part of particular individual agents is admissible as some evidence of a lack of a causal connection, countering plaintiff's circumstantial evidence of proximity or disparate treatment.").
Indeed, Second Circuit precedent suggests that where the individual decision-maker lacked knowledge of the protected activity, there must be evidence that the decision-maker was at least influenced or encouraged to take the adverse action by a superior with knowledge of the protected activity. See Henry v. Wyeth Pharms., Inc., 616 F.3d 134, 147-48 (2d Cir. 2010)  [*37] ("A causal connection is sufficiently demonstrated if the agent who decides to impose the adverse action but is ignorant of the plaintiff's protected activity acts pursuant to encouragement by a superior (who has knowledge) to disfavor the plaintiff."); Gordon, 232 F.3d at 117 ("A jury, however, can find retaliation even if the agent denies direct knowledge of a plaintiffs protected activities, for example, so long as the jury finds that the circumstances evidence knowledge of the protected activities or the jury concludes that an agent is acting explicitly or implicit upon the orders of a superior who has the requisite knowledge."). No such evidence of influence or encouragement has been presented to the Court.
Second, Seivright's 2008 EEOC charge is so far temporally removed from the alleged retaliation that a causal connection is implausible. The same can be said of the arbitration proceedings, which were the result of a grievance filed on August 25, 2008, over two years before Seivright's termination.8 With regard to her settlement of the discrimination lawsuit, although no date for this settlement appears in the parties' submissions, the records of the Bronx County Supreme Court  [*38] show that the case was resolved in February 2010, a full eight months before her termination. (See <https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/webcivil/FCASSearch>, Case No. 020840/2003). See Communs. Network Int'l, Ltd. v. MCI WorldCom Communs., Inc. (In re WorldCom, Inc.), 708 F.3d 327, 340 n.63 (2d Cir. 2013) (taking judicial notice of state court records). Courts have found that similar or shorter durations did not support finding a causal connection between a protected activity and alleged retaliation. Clark County Sch. Dist., 532 U.S. at 273-74 (citing with approval cases holding that three and four month temporal intervals were not sufficient to establish causation and holding that a twenty month interval "suggests, by itself, no causality at all"); Sanchez v. Conn. Natural Gas Co., 421 Fed. Appx. 33, 35 (2d Cir. Apr. 29, 2011) (unpublished) (two years); Perry v. NYSARC, Inc., 424 Fed. Appx. 23, 26 (2d Cir. May 27, 2011) (unpublished) (eleven months); Sareen v. Port Auth. of N. Y. & N.J., No. 12-cv-2823, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176093, at *44-46 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2013); Wojcik v. Brandiss, No. 10-cv-1579, 973 F. Supp. 2d 195, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137449, at *47 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2013) ("Claims of retaliation  [*39] are, however, routinely dismissed when as few as three months elapse between the protected activity and the alleged act of retaliation.").
Third, the record reflects significant efforts by Montefiore to allow Seivright to return to work that are inconsistent with a claim that her termination was retaliatory. It is undisputed that Seivright's job as Care Management Coordinator was unfilled for at least six months (CSMF ¶ 23; RSMF ¶ 23; Chin Dep. 105:1-17 & Ex. 27), and, therefore, the Seivright's suggestions that Montefiore retaliated because it somehow did not comply with the CBA are unavailing.9 In addition, not only was Seivright given the full nine months of medical leave provided by the CBA, she was also given an additional three months to find employment with Montefiore after her leave expired. Seivright met weekly with Hunter for a full five months to review job postings, and it is undisputed that the positions available either did not meet her medical restrictions or failed to comply with her requirement  [*40] that they be NYSNA positions that did not involve a pay cut. Likewise, although claiming that Montefiore denied her reasonable accommodations and that this demonstrates their hostility toward her, she has not presented any evidence of a reasonable accommodation that was requested and denied.
Finally, Seivright cites to the communications that occurred while she was on leave and during the months she was reviewing job postings and claims they demonstrate "bad faith and hostility." (Opp. at 21). However, these remarks simply discuss Seivright's leave, how long her position should be held, and where to place her in the event that she returned. At most, some of the remarks may evince some frustration with regard to the uncertainty surrounding her status or when she would return, but do not give rise to an inference that her termination was retaliation for her EEOC complaint, arbitration,  [*41] or settlement. Indeed, the only remark that even alludes to a protected activity that Seivright claims provoked retaliation is Burns's statement referring to the six month period Seivright's job was to be held and that "with what's been going on with her, I hear it in my sleep." Such stray remarks cannot form the basis for a retaliation claim, especially given that it appears that Nerissa Chin was the decision-maker as to Seivright's termination. (Burns Aug. Decl. ¶¶ 3-4). See, e.g., Gioia v. Forbes Media LLC, No. 11-cv-4406, 501 Fed. Appx. 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2012) ("These emails, however, took place months before Antonelli was terminated, and while disparaging of Antonelli, are not a sufficient basis on which to conclude that she was terminated because of her illness . . . ."); Wojcik v. Brandiss, No. 10-cv-1579, 973 F. Supp. 2d 195, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137449, at *46-48; Valtchev v. City of New York, No. 06-cv-7157, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79815, at *33-35 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2009); Young v. Pitney Bowes, Inc., No. 03-cv-1161, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20788, 59-63 (D. Conn. Mar. 21, 2006); Douglas v. Dist. Council 37 Mun. Emps. Educ. Fund Trust, 207 F. Supp. 2d 282, 291 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (ambiguous and abstract  [*42] comments do not give rise to inference of discrimination).

D. Supplemental Jurisdiction
The Court's final task is to determine whether to maintain supplemental jurisdiction over Seivright's disability discrimination claims under the NYSHRL and NYCHRL, which the Court has not yet discussed.10 Subject matter jurisdiction in this matter was premised on federal question jurisdiction over Ms. Seivright's ADA and ADEA claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, with supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. (Am. Compl. ¶ 5). Having granted summary judgment in favor of Montefiore on Ms. Seivright's federal claims, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims. A district court "may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim . . . if . . . the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction." 28 U.S.C. § 1367.
The decision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is within the sound discretion of the district court and involves an assessment, at each stage of the case, of the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity. See Lundy v. Catholic Health Sys. of Long Island, Inc., 711 F.3d 106, 117-18 (2d Cir. 2013). "Once all federal claims have been dismissed, the balance of factors will usually point toward a declination." Id. at 118 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see also Cromwell v. N. Y. City Health & Hosps. Corp., No. 12-cv-4251, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69414, at *11-13 (S.D.N.Y. May 15, 2013).
There are substantial comity reasons to relinquish jurisdiction over the NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims for in this matter. First, the substantive state and municipal law is broader than the corresponding federal law. See, e.g., Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 108-09 (2d Cir. 2013).  [*44] For instance, the state and municipal law claims allow recovery where an employer did not engage in a good-faith interactive process even where it did not lead to a denial of a reasonable accommodation. See Morse v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 941 F. Supp. 2d 274, 302 n.16 (E.D.N.Y. 2013); Martin v United Parcel Serv. of Am., Inc., 104 A.D.3d 1173, 1174, 961 N.Y.S.2d 663 (N.Y. App. Div. 4th Dep't 2013); Phillips v. City of New York, 66 A.D.3d 170, 176, 884 N.Y.S.2d 369 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dep't 2009). In addition, it appears that the NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims may entail different remedies depending on whether a reasonable accommodation was possible. See Phillips, 66 A.D.3d at 177-78 n.6. Declining jurisdiction would allow a New York court to address these claims under the applicable law. As to judicial economy, the Court has not considered whether Montefiore did, in fact, engage in an interactive process with Seivright or whether the evidence establishes a dispute of fact sufficient to proceed to a jury under state law. Nor does the Court perceive any inconvenience or unfairness with the remainder of this case proceeding in state court.

III. CONCLUSION
Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted as to Seivright's claims  [*45] for age discrimination under the ADEA, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL; her claims for disability discrimination under the ADA; and her claims for retaliation under the ADA and ADEA. The Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over her remaining state law claims and, therefore, does not address them. The Clerk of the Court is directed to terminate this action.
