ORDER RE PARTIES' CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [35] [37]
On July 6, 2018, the Court held a hearing on Plaintiff Tim Crowley and Defendants Gel-Mark Investments, LLC and Arman Corporation's ("Defendants" or "7-Eleven")1 cross-motions for summary judgment ("Defs.' MSJ") [Doc. # 35]; ("Pl.'s MSJ") [Doc. # 37]. Having duly considered the parties' written submissions, including post-hearing supplemental submissions, the Court DENIES IN PART AND GRANTS IN PART 7-Eleven's Motion and DENIES IN PART AND GRANTS IN PART Crowley's Motion.

I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND2
This case concerns the Calimesa, California [*2]  7-Eleven store's compliance with the American with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. Crowley is a paraplegic who cannot walk and who uses a wheelchair for mobility. Pl.'s Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("PUF") ¶ 1 [Doc. # 37-2]. On July 8, 2017, Crowley went to 7-Eleven, located in Calimesa, California, to shop. Id. ¶¶ 3, 6. 7-Eleven is a business establishment and a place of public accommodation. Id. ¶ 4. 7-Eleven's parking lot has parking spaces, including one reserved for disabled persons. Id. ¶ 7. This reserved parking space does not have a marked access aisle next to it. Id. ¶ 8.
Crowley needs a parking space with an appropriate marked aisle, an adequate access aisle, and adequate warning lettering to exit his car. Id. ¶ 10. Crowley also needs the parking stall to be level so that he can exit his vehicle safely. Id. ¶ 11. If Crowley tries to exit his car without adequate room, he runs the risk of getting struck by another driver. Id. ¶ 10. Crowley challenges the following characteristics in 7-Eleven's parking lot: (1) the reserved parking space does not have a marked and reserved aisle next to the stall and (2) the parking space has an inaccessible slope greater than 2.08%. Def.'s [*3]  Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("DUF") ¶ 1 [Doc. # 35-6]. 7-Eleven's lack of accessible parking caused Crowley difficulty, discomfort, and frustration. PUF ¶ 13. Crowley has returned to 7-Eleven several times since his July 8, 2017 visit, and he still found that the store lacked an adequate access aisle. Id. ¶¶ 14-15. Indeed, Crowley complained to 7-Eleven employees about the inadequate parking space on several occasions. Id. ¶ 16.
On February 22, 2018, Janis Kent, Crowley's expert, conducted a site inspection of the 7-Eleven. Id. ¶ 17. As of this date, 7-Eleven had not complied with the ADA's requirements. Id. ¶ 18. Kent discovered: (1) the access aisle did not have a complete blue border; (2) the access aisle had a slope exceeding 2.083%; (3) portions of the parking space were cracking, thus creating openings and height differentials; (4) the tow-away sign was not compliant; (5) the path of travel from the parking space was less than 48-inches in clear width for more than 24-inches in length; (6) the handrail extensions on the path of travel from the public right of way do not continue in the same direction; (7) the ramp did not have a smooth top landing; (8) the ramp's bottom [*4]  landing was not level for 72 inches; and (9) the path of travel from the pedestrian ramp to the store entrance was less than 48-inches in clear width for more than 24-inches in length. Id. ¶¶ 19-27. 7-Eleven did not present any evidence in conjunction with its motion for summary judgment showing that it fixed these problems. Instead, it disputes that these deficiencies prevented Crowley from accessing the store and that these barriers are unrelated to his disability. Defs.' Response to Pl.'s SUF [Doc. # 40-3] ¶¶18-27.
For its part, 7-Eleven hired Triamid Construction of Central CA ("Triamid") to make ADA upgrades to the store and make it ADA-compliant. DUF ¶ 4. Triamid then hired California Certified Access Specialist ("CAS") to inspect 7-Eleven's property and provide plans for remediating access barriers. Id. ¶ 5. CAS provided Triamid with plans to address 7-Eleven's access barriers. Id. ¶ 6. After acquiring the appropriate building permits, Triamid made CAS's recommended changes. Id. ¶¶ 6-7. Namely, Triamid corrected the lack of an access aisle and inaccessible slope. Id. ¶ 8.
After briefing was completed and a hearing was held on this matter, Defendants' rebuttal expert, Neal Casper, [*5]  inspected the Property. Declaration of Neal Casper ("Casper Decl.") ¶ 3 [Doc. 48-1]. Based on his observations, Casper found that the Property has become fully ADA compliant. See generally Casper Decl. Crowley concedes this point. Reply to Supp. Br. at 1 [Doc. # 51].

II.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On August 16, 2017, Crowley filed this action. Complaint ¶¶ 30-44 [Doc. # 1]. On April 9, 2018, Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint alleging that 7-Eleven violated the: (1) ADA and (2) Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51-53. First Amended Complaint ("FAC") [Doc. # 31]. On June 1, 2018, Crowley and 7-Eleven filed their cross-motions for summary judgment. The motions are fully briefed. [Doc. ## 40-43.] The Court held a hearing on this matter on July 6, 2018. Civil Minutes [Doc. # 46]. After that hearing, the Court invited counsel to file supplemental briefing explaining the scope of injunctive relief requested and the nexus between that relief and Plaintiff's disability. Id. The Court also asked the parties to address whether Defendants have authority to make or arrange the corrective action requested in the injunctive relief. Id. Both parties filed supplemental briefs. Pl.'s Supp. Br. [Doc. # 47]; Defs.' [*6]  Supp. Br. [Doc. # 48]. Thereafter, Defendants submitted updated evidence which shows that the ADA access barriers have been removed. [Doc. # 50]. Because of this belatedly submitted evidence, Crowley submitted a reply brief conceding that the corrective action had indeed been performed. [Doc. # 51.]

III.

LEGAL STANDARD
When faced with cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court considers each motion on its own merits to determine whether the Rule 56 summary judgment standard is satisfied. Fair Housing Council of Riverside Cty., Inc. v. Riverside Two, 249 F.3d 1132, 1136 (9th Cir. 2001). Summary judgment should be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); accord Wash. Mut. Inc. v. United States, 636 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Nat'l Ass'n of Optometrists & Opticians v. Harris, 682 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248.
The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its initial burden, Rule 56(c) requires the nonmoving party to "go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific [*7]  facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e)). "If a moving party fails to carry its initial burden of production, the nonmoving party has no obligation to produce anything, even if the nonmoving party would have the ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000). "In such a case, the nonmoving party may defeat the motion for summary judgment without producing anything." Id. at 1103. "In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). "Rather, it draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Id.

IV.

DISCUSSION
7-Eleven's MSJ is based entirely on its argument that Crowley's ADA claim is moot because it removed the barriers blocking access to the store. As such, 7-Eleven argues that Crowley does not have standing to seek an injunction against it under the ADA—the only remedy permitted by law. And if the Court cannot hear Crowley's ADA claim, 7-Eleven argues that the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Crowley's remaining Unruh Act claim. In his Reply to the Supplemental Briefing, Crowley concedes that his ADA claim is moot as Defendants removed [*8]  the access barriers. Nevertheless, Crowley asks the Court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his Unruh Act claim.

A. Crowley's ADA Claim is Moot
The party asserting federal jurisdiction bears the burden of pleading and establishing Article III standing. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 562, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). To have standing to bring a claim in federal court, a plaintiff must show: (1) an "injury in fact;" (2) "a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of"; and (3) that "the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision." Doran v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 524 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61). "The requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness)." United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 396, 100 S. Ct. 1202, 63 L. Ed. 2d 479 (1980) (internal quotation omitted). A case is moot and a plaintiff loses standing when (1) "the issues presented are no longer live" or (2) the parties lack a "legally cognizable interest in the outcome." Id. (internal quotations omitted).
To have standing to seek an injunction, there must be a chance that the plaintiff will face the complained-of conduct in the future. See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105-106, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983). In the context of the ADA, if the plaintiff has already received everything to which he would be entitled, then his claims are moot unless there is [*9]  evidence the plaintiff will be subjected to the same wrongful conduct by the same defendant. Parr v. L&L Drive-Inn Rest., 96 F. Supp. 2d 1065, 1087 (D. Hawaii 2000).
7-Eleven contends that Crowley's request for injunctive relief is moot because it has removed the access barriers. Def.'s MSJ at 5; DUF ¶¶ 6-8. Crowley now acknowledges as much. Reply to Supp. Br. at 1. Because no barriers are present, Crowley's ADA claim is moot and the claim is dismissed on that basis. Parr, 96 F. Supp. 2d at 1087.

B. The Court Will Exercise Supplemental Jurisdiction Over Crowley's Unruh Act Claim
Although the Court has dismissed Plaintiff's ADA claim, it may retain supplemental jurisdiction over his remaining Unruh Act claim. See Grove v. De La Cruz, 407 F. Supp. 2d 1126, 1131 (C.D. Cal. 2005). "[I]n any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy[.]" 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). Conversely, district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if: (1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law; (2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim over which the district court has original jurisdiction; (3) the district court has dismissed [*10]  all claims over which it has original jurisdiction; or (4) there are compelling reasons to decline jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). "The district court's decision whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is informed by whether exercising jurisdiction over the pendent state claims comports with the values of economy, convenience, fairness, and comity." Grove, 407 F. Supp. 2d at 1131.
The Court will exercise its discretion to retain jurisdiction over Plaintiff's Unruh Act claim—even though it has dismissed his ADA claim as moot. The Court is inclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction because this case did not become moot until after the MSJ briefing was completed and a hearing was held. Indeed, at the hearing, the parties had the benefit of the Court' tentative ruling wherein it had ruled on the merits of the Unruh Act claim. Given these circumstances, it would be unfair to now force Crowley to litigate his Unruh Act claim in state court because he has diligently prosecuted his case whereas Defendants have been dilatory in producing evidence showing compliance with the ADA nearly a year after the lawsuit began.3

C. Crowley is Entitled to Summary Judgment and Statutory Damages on His Unruh Act Claim
Crowley moves for summary [*11]  judgment motion on his Unruh Act claim on the same basis as his ADA claim. Def.'s MSJ at 12-13 (citing Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 731 (9th Cir. 2007)). A violation of the ADA is a per se violation of the Unruh Act. Cal. Civ. Code § 52(f); Cullen v. Netflix, Inc., 880 F. Supp. 2d 1017, 1023 (N.D. Cal. 2012). To prevail on an ADA discrimination claim, the plaintiff must show: (1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) the plaintiff was denied public accommodation by the defendant because of his disability. Molski, 481 F.3d at 730. A plaintiff can satisfy the third prong by showing discrimination based on an architectural barrier. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv); Parr, 96 F. Supp. 2d at 1085. "To succeed on [an] ADA claim of discrimination on account of one's disability due to an architectural barrier, the plaintiff must also prove that: (1) the existing facility at the defendant's place of business presents an architectural barrier prohibited under the ADA, and (2) the removal of the barrier is readily achievable." Parr, 96 F. Supp. 2d at 1085; see also Rush v. Denco Enters., Inc., 857 F. Supp. 2d 969, 973 (C.D. Cal. 2012), overruled on other grounds by 595 F. App'x 727 (9th Cir. 2015).
Here, there is no dispute that Crowley is disabled within the meaning of the ADA—he is a paraplegic who must use a wheelchair for mobility. PUF ¶ 1; see also Fortyune v. American Multi-Cinema, Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1084 (9th Cir. 2004) (acknowledging that a wheelchair-bound patron is disabled). There is also [*12]  no dispute that 7-Eleven is a place of public accommodation and that Gel-Mark Investments owns the property at which the store is located. PUF ¶¶ 4-5. Crowley's ADA claim thus turns on whether he was denied access.
Crowley has shown that 7-Eleven's property had an architectural barrier prohibited by the ADA. The ADAAG standards govern whether a facility is accessible. See Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 947 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc). Using these standards, Crowley alleges that 7-Eleven's property had numerous architectural barriers. Pl.'s MSJ at 7-12. First, Crowley introduces unrebutted evidence that the parking lot slope was non-compliant with the ADA because it was graded at more than 2.08% (1:48).4 36 C.F.R. Pt. 1191, App. D § 502.45; PUF ¶ 20. Second, Crowley alleges that there was no accessible path of travel from the parking space. Pl.'s Mot. at 10. Crowley introduces unrebutted evidence that the path of travel was less than 48 inches in clear width for more than 24 inches, thus violating the ADA. PUF ¶ 23; 36 C.F.R. Pt. 1191, App. D § 403.5.1. Third, Crowley introduces unrebutted evidence that the public right of way was defective, namely that there were issues with the ramp's handrails because they did not extend in the same direction as the ramp run. See Pl.'s Mot. at 10-11; PUF [*13]  ¶ 24.
Crowley has also shown that removing these architectural barriers was readily achievable and apparently has been achieved. See 28 C.F.R. § 36.304 (lists barrier removals that are readily achievable). One such readily achievable barrier removal is "[c]reating designated accessible parking spaces," which includes removing an excessive slope for a parking space. 28 C.F.R. § 36.304(b)(18); Gaylor v. Greenbriar of Dahlonega Shopping Ctr., Inc., 975 F. Supp. 2d 1374, 1391-92 (N.D. Ga. 2013). Moreover, creating an accessible path of travel is considered readily achievable. 28 C.F.R. § 36.304(c)(1). When it answered, 7-Eleven did not offer any evidence showing that redressing these defects was an undue burden or disproportionate. 28 C.F.R. 36.403(f); Answer [Doc. # 18] ¶ 10. Crowley has introduced sufficient evidence establishing that there is no genuine dispute of material fact that 7-Eleven violated the ADA. As such, he has also made out an Unruh Act violation. Cal. Civ. Code § 52(f).
Because 7-Eleven violated the Unruh Act, Crowley asks for statutory damages. Pl.'s Mot. at 13-14; Cal. Civ. Code § 52(a). Unruh Act violators are liable for "each and every offense for the actual damages" plus treble damages. Cal. Civ. Code § 52(a). The minimum damage for each Unruh Act violation is $4,000. Id. "The litigant need not prove she suffered actual damages to recover the independent statutory damages of $4,000." Molski, 481 F.3d at 731. Crowley has brought [*14]  forth undisputed evidence that he has faced illegal barriers. PUF ¶¶ 18-27. Thus, he is entitled to $4,000.
7-Eleven contends that Crowley has not shown there is no dispute of material fact on his Unruh Act claim as to justify awarding damages. Pl.'s Opp'n [Doc. # 40] at 10-15. The Court will address these arguments in turn. First, relying on the Unruh Act's legislative history, 7-Eleven argues that to be eligible for damages, Crowley must explain why he visited the store multiple times despite knowing the store was non-compliant. Id. at 11 (citing 2012 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 383 (S.B. 1186), § 25(a)); see also Antoninetti v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 643 F.3d 1165, 1177 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that a plaintiff could not recover damages under the California Disabled Persons Act for going to a place of public accommodation with no intention of being served). Crowley has explained his visits. He has introduced evidence showing that he continued to patronize 7-Eleven—despite the architectural barriers—because it has a selection of items he needs and it is close to his home. Pl.'s Reply [Doc. # 43] at 19; PUF ¶¶ 28-29. Indeed, Crowley repeatedly complained to 7-Eleven's employees about the architectural barriers. PUF ¶ 16. Crowley also introduced evidence that the lack of accessible [*15]  parking caused him "difficulty, discomfort, and frustration." Id. ¶ 13. 7-Eleven has not introduced any evidence contradicting these facts. Rather, Defendants speculate that Crowley may have visited the store to advance his position in litigation and that he did not suffer sufficient embarrassment. Defs.' Opp'n at 12-13. 7-Eleven's contentions, however, are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); see also Siegel v. Shell Oil Co., 612 F.3d 932, 937 (7th Cir. 2010) ("Summary judgment is the 'put up or shut up' moment in a lawsuit.").
Second, 7-Eleven contends that there is a dispute as to the exact date on which Crowley visited the store. Defs.' Opp'n at 14. But the exact date of Crowley's visit is not a material dispute that affects whether 7-Eleven had architectural barriers or whether Crowley visited the store. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Molski, 481 F.3d at 730 (standard to show an ADA and Unruh Act violation).
In sum, 7-Eleven has not introduced evidence to create a triable issue on whether Crowley is entitled to statutory damages on his Unruh Act claim. The Court therefore GRANTS Crowley's prayer for $4,000 under the Unruh Act.

V.

CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, the Court:
1. GRANTS 7-Eleven's motion for summary judgment challenging Crowley's standing to pursue injunctive relief, [*16]  and DENIES the request that the Court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his Unruh Act claim;
2. DENIES Crowley's motion for summary judgment on his First Claim under the ADA.
3. GRANTS Crowley's motion for summary judgment on Second Claim under the Unruh Act.
4. GRANTS Crowley's motion on the issue of statutory damages under the Unruh Act, and a judgment against both Defendants, jointly and severally, for $4,000.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
