Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is before the Court on Defendant Norfolk Southern Corporation's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and accompanying memorandum of law. ECF Nos. 37-38. Plaintiff Janet Ogden Price filed a memorandum in opposition. ECF No. 52. Norfolk Southern filed a reply. ECF No. 55. This matter was referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for a report and recommendation pursuant to a Referral Order from the United States District Judge. ECF No. 64; see also 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b); E.D. Va. Loc. Civ. R. 72. For the foregoing reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Norfolk Southern's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 38, be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

I. [*2]  OVERVIEW
Plaintiff filed her Complaint on April 22, 2021, alleging nine counts of discrimination. ECF No. 1. The Complaint alleges the following claims1: (1) Gender Discrimination and Retaliation in Violation of the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. (Count I); (2) Discrimination and Retaliation in Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA")2, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. (Count III); (3) Failure to Accommodate in Violation of the ADA (Count IV); (4) Gender Discrimination Based on Failure to Promote in Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (Count VI); (5) Retaliation in Violation of Title VII (Count VII); (6) Age Discrimination in Violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. (Count VIII); (7) Intersectional Discrimination in Violation of the ADEA, ADA, and/or Title VII (Count IX). See ECF No. 1; ECF No. 52 at 18. Norfolk Southern moved for summary judgment on each count in Plaintiff's Complaint. See ECF Nos. 37, 38.
On January 4, 2022, United States District Judge Smith moved the jury trial scheduled in this matter, and on January 18, 2022, referred the pending Amended Motion for Summary Judgment to the undersigned. ECF Nos. 61, 64. The Court held a hearing on April 7, 2022. ECF No. 73. Accordingly, the motion is ripe for disposition.3

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment [*3]  under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 is appropriate when the Court, viewing the record as a whole and in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, finds there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A court should grant summary judgment if the nonmoving party, after adequate time for discovery, has failed to establish the existence of an essential element of that party's case, on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must go beyond the facts alleged in the pleadings and instead rely upon affidavits, depositions, or other evidence to show a genuine issue for trial. See id. at 324. Conclusory statements, without specific evidentiary support, are insufficient. Causey v. Balog, 162 F.3d 795, 802 (4th Cir. 1998). Rather, "there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [party]." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. A party opposing summary judgment must present more than "a scintilla of evidence." Id. at 251.
Under Rule 56 the evidence proffered, either in support of or in opposition to, the summary judgment motion, must be admissible. Sakaria v. Trans World Airlines, 8 F.3d 164, 171 (4th Cir. 1993); see also, Mitchell v. Data Gen. Corp., 12 F.3d 1310, 1316 (4th Cir. 1993) holding modified by Stokes v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 206 F.3d 420 (4th Cir. 2000) (holding that, in opposing a defendant's motion for summary judgment, [*4]  "[t]he summary judgment inquiry thus scrutinizes the plaintiffs case to determine whether the plaintiff has proffered sufficient proof, in the form of admissible evidence, that could carry the burden of proof of his claim at trial."). A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by citing to specific materials in the record. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "In determining a motion for summary judgment, the Court may assume that facts identified by the moving party in its listing of material facts are admitted, unless such a fact is controverted in the statement of genuine issues filed in opposition to the motion." E.D. Va. Loc. Civ. R. 56(b).

III. STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS
The Court has fashioned its undisputed material facts from those facts put forth by the parties which were uncontested, consistent with Eastern District of Virginia Local Rule 56(b). There appear to be disputes regarding facts necessary and material to resolution of the instant case. As such, this Court resolves the motions for summary judgment pursuant to the following undisputed material facts:
Plaintiff is female and is currently 59 years of age. ECF No. 52 at 1, Price Statement of Facts ("Price SOF") ¶ 1. Plaintiff was an employee [*5]  of Norfolk Southern from 2011 until 2015 when she left the company to care for her ailing parent and was rehired by Norfolk Southern in August 2018. ECF No. 52 at 1, Price SOF ¶ 2. She was rehired into their sourcing department, ECF No. 38 at 10, Norfolk Southern Statement of Facts ("NS SOF") ¶ 1, to her former position of Sourcing Supervisor, ECF No. 52 at 1, Price SOF ¶ 2. Plaintiff's performance reviews in each year of her 2011-2015 employment with NS show her ratings as meeting or exceeding expectations in every category. ECF No. 52 at 2-3, Price SOF ¶ 4. In 2018, after Plaintiff was rehired by NS, she was rated in her performance review as a "Solid Performer" and her Manager noted that, "[i]n 2019, we will seek out opportunities to get [Price] additional exposure and become familiar with the standard purchasing processes used by other buyer. This exposure will make [Price] more versatile and prepare her to transition into a role of greater responsibility." Id.; see also ECF No. 52, attach. 16 at 3. When Plaintiff's Manager who wrote that review was leaving the role, he suggested that she apply for it. ECF No. 52 at 3, Price SOF ¶ 5. The job posting for the Manager role contained [*6]  a "Career Path" section which listed "Sourcing Supervisor" as a predecessor job, which was Plaintiff's position at the time. Id. at ¶ 6. Plaintiff holds a Bachelor of Science in Organizational Management. ECF No. 52 at 15, Price SOF ¶ 4.
Plaintiff applied for the role of Manager in the Sourcing Department in 2019 (the "Manager Purchasing position"). ECF No. 38 at 10, NS SOF ¶ 3; ECF No. 52 at 3, Price SOF ¶ 7. Plaintiff was not interviewed for the Manager Purchasing position. ECF No. 38 at 11, NS SOF ¶ 4; ECF No. 52 at 3, Price SOF ¶ 8. Fred Alley ("Alley"), a male, was ultimately selected for the role. ECF No. 38 at 11, NS SOF ¶ 6; ECF No. 52 at 3, Price SOF ¶ 9. Alley was the fifth consecutive male to hold this position. ECF No. 52 at 4, Price SOF ¶ 16. Alley had served in various manager positions with Norfolk Southern since 1998, including Logistics Manager, Account Manager, Manager Assets, and Manager Pricing. ECF No. 38 at 11, NS SOF ¶ 7. Alley and his predecessor in the Manager Purchasing position, Mark Strelow, both had a woman as their supervisor. ECF No. 38 at 12, NS SOF ¶ 9; ECF No. 52 at 16, Price SOF ¶ 8.
During the time Plaintiff worked with Alley, she said that Alley had [*7]  outbursts of anger, refused to listen when she tried to explain things, and would pick up things and throw or slam them down on his desk in frustration. ECF No. 38 at 12, NS SOF ¶ 11; ECF No. 52 at 5, Price SOF ¶ 23. Alley never made comments about Plaintiff's gender. ECF No. 38 at 13, NS SOF ¶ 14; see also ECF No. 52, attach. 1 at 107 (Price Dep. 107:3-5). Richard Scott ("Scott") was the Manager Fleet Management, and the Fleet Management Department where Scott worked was the customer of the Sourcing Department where Plaintiff worked. ECF No. 38 at 13, NS SOF ¶¶ 15, 17. Plaintiff felt harassed while working with Richard Scott. ECF No. 38 at 13, NS SOF ¶ 16; ECF No. 52 at 6, Price SOF ¶ 25. Melanie Green Peterson, a woman, worked in Plaintiff's role in 2017. ECF No. 52 at 7, Price SOF ¶ 30. That year, Peterson wrote in her Annual Review that she was "repeatedly subjected to dismissive, rude, disrespectful, condescending and not responsive behavior, on account of individuals that I worked with closely in Fleet Administration." Id. Peterson went on to say in this report that "[t]his deplorable treatment continued unabated for over a year, with very anemic and ineffectual intervention" [*8]  by her immediate supervisor or director, or the perpetrator's supervisors. Id. Plaintiff said she discussed Scott's behavior with a person in the Employment Assistance Program and a person in Legal Department. ECF No. 38 at 14, NS SOF ¶ 18; ECF No. 52 at 6, Price SOF ¶ 27. Plaintiff did not intend her discussions with those employees to be a formal complaint or expect them to take any action related to these conversations. ECF No. 38 at 14, NS SOF ¶ 19.
On November 11, 2019, Plaintiff informed her supervisors that she would need to take half days for medical reasons between November 12, 2019, and November 15, 2019, and November 18 and 19, 2019, "if needed." ECF No. 38 at 16, NS SOF ¶ 29; ECF No. 52 at 8, Price SOF ¶ 38. Norfolk Southern informed Plaintiff that working from home was not an option. ECF No. 52 at 8, Price SOF ¶ 32; see also ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 23. On November 14, 2019, Plaintiff's physician requested that Plaintiff be permitted to work half days from home for three weeks. ECF No. 52 at 9, Price SOF ¶ 40. Because Plaintiff could not work full-time, her supervisor referred her to Norfolk Southern Health Services ("NSHS") and the Chief Medical Officer to apply for leave [*9]  pursuant to the FMLA. ECF No. 38 at 16, NS SOF ¶ 31. On November 16, 2019, Plaintiff's medical provider submitted the FMLA certification requesting "continuous leave" but also handwrote that she requested "intermittent leave." Id. at ¶ 32. NSHS contacted Plaintiff throughout the process of getting FMLA approval regarding what documents were needed to evaluate her request. Id. On November 19, 2019, NSHS told Plaintiff that her FMLA application was not sufficient because it did not contain the necessary office notes. Id. at ¶ 33. On December 2, 2019, Plaintiff was approved for intermittent leave but was advised that she needed additional office visits notes to be approved for continuous leave. ECF No. 38 at 17, NS SOF ¶ 33. NSHS notified Plaintiff on December 13, 2019, and December 20, 2019, that she needed to resubmit her certification with the necessary office visit notes. Id. at ¶ 34. Plaintiff does not maintain that these notifications were discriminatory in nature. Id. Plaintiff submitted the required documents, and was approved for continuous leave on December 27, 2019. Id. at ¶ 35. Plaintiff did not report to work at the office after November 11, 2019, and did not lose any compensation [*10]  or other benefits while waiting for her FMLA approval. Id.
Well before Plaintiff went out on FMLA leave, Norfolk Southern contemplated eliminating Plaintiff's position. ECF No. 38 at 14, NS SOF ¶ 21. In December 2019, Plaintiff's duties as Sourcing Supervisor were absorbed by the Engineering Department. ECF No. 38 at 14-15, NS SOF ¶ 22; ECF No. 52 at 10, Price SOF ¶ 50. Plaintiff's FMLA leave ended on February 3, 2020. ECF No. 38 at 17, NS SOF ¶ 35. During that time, Plaintiff also received salary continuance, which is Norfolk Southern's short-term disability program. ECF No. 52 at 9, Price SOF ¶ 45. Plaintiff's salary continuance benefit was set to end on February 9, 2020. Id. ¶ 52. Norfolk Southern sent Plaintiff a letter on February 7, 2020, stating that she was released from her position due to a reduction in force. ECF No. 38 at 14, NS SOF ¶ 21; ECF No. 52 at 11, Price SOF ¶ 50.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. The McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting Framework
Each of Plaintiff's claims alleging discrimination under the FMLA, ADA, and Title VII may be proven through either (1) direct evidence of discrimination, or (2) indirect evidence of discrimination using the burden-shifting framework set forth [*11]  in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) (the "McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework"). Lyons v. City of Alexandria, 35 F.4th 285 (4th Cir. 2022) ("Without direct evidence of intentional discrimination, a plaintiff may use the burden-shifting framework."); see also See Gomez v. Haystax Tech., Inc., 292 F. Supp. 3d 676, 683 (E.D. Va. 2017) (McDonnell Douglas applies to claims under Title VII, the ADA, and the ADEA); Laing v. Fed Express Corp., 703 F.3d 713, 717 (4th Cir. 2013) (McDonnell Douglas applies to FMLA claims because they are analogous to discrimination claims brought under Title VII); but see Perdue v. Sanofi-Aventis U.S., LLC, 999 F.3d 954, 959 n.2 (4th Cir. 2021) (noting that the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting framework does not apply in a failure-to-accommodate claim because that claim requires no evidence of discriminatory intent).
As explained in detail here and applied to Plaintiff's claims as alleged below, that standard provides that in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, "a plaintiff asserting discriminatory treatment . . . may avoid summary judgment by proceeding under the burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas." Haynes v. Waste Connections, Inc., 922 F.3d 219, 223 (4th Cir. 2019). To establish a claim of discrimination, a plaintiff must first make a prima facie case. Id. If an employee meets his or her burden to establish a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. The employer's burden at the second step is "one of production, not persuasion." Ullrich v. CEXEC, Inc., 233 F. Supp. 3d 515, 527 (E.D. Va. 2017).
If the employer [*12]  meets this burden of production, the employee must then demonstrate that the defendant's proffered reason is pretextual. Id. Evidence that the defendant's explanation is "unworthy of credence" or "other circumstantial evidence" can be sufficiently probative of pretext. Id. at 528 (quoting Mereish v. Walker, 359 F.3d 330, 335 (4th Cir. 2004)). However, a plaintiff has the "ultimate burden of persuading the court" that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination or retaliation. Foster v. Univ. of Md.-Eastern Shore, 787 F.3d 243, 252 (4th Cir. 2015) (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., 354 F.3d 277, 285 (4th Cir. 2004)). Thus, at the pretext stage, "'a plaintiff must establish both that the employer's reason was false and that retaliation was the real reason for the challenged conduct,' which is effectively a 'but-for' standard" of causation. Wootten v. Virginia, 154 F. Supp. 3d 322, 336 (W.D. Va. 2016) (quoting Foster, 787 F.3d at 252).

B. Discrimination and Retaliation in Violation of the FMLA (Count I)
Count I of Plaintiff's Complaint alleges discrimination and retaliation in violation of the FMLA. Plaintiff contends that her FMLA discrimination and retaliation claim arises out of the transfer of Plaintiff's job duties and the elimination of her position, and her purported reassignment to work under Lisa Holloman. ECF No. 52 at 18. Norfolk Southern argues it should be granted summary judgment on [*13]  Count I because Plaintiff cannot establish a causal connection between Plaintiff taking FMLA leave and any adverse action by Norfolk Southern. ECF No. 38 at 38-39.
The FMLA provides eligible employees up to twelve-weeks of leave for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform her job during any twelve-month period. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). Under the FMLA, an employer is required to reinstate an employee to the position he or she held before taking FMLA leave, or to an equivalent position. 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a). Additionally, the FMLA makes it unlawful to discriminate or retaliate against any employee for asserting rights under the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2); see also Yashenko v. Harrah's NC Casino Co., LLC, 446 F.3d 541, 546 (4th Cir. 2006) (noting that 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2) contains proscriptive provisions that protect employees from discrimination or retaliation for exercising their substantive rights and permit claims for discrimination or retaliation under the FMLA)4; Fry v. Rand Constr. Corp., 964 F.3d 239, 244 (4th Cir. 2020) (noting that 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2) "prohibits retaliation or discrimination for opposing unlawful practices."). An employee can prove a retaliation claim with either direct and indirect evidence of retaliatory animus or demonstrate intent by producing circumstantial evidence for the court to evaluate under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Sharif v. United Airlines, Inc., 841 F.3d 199, 203 (4th Cir. 2016) (noting that a plaintiff need [*14]  only establish the elements of a prima facie case in the absence of direct evidence).
Direct evidence of retaliation "encompasses 'conduct or statements' that both (1) 'reflect directly the alleged discriminatory attitude,' and (2) 'bear directly on the contested employment decision.'" Laing, 703 F.3d at 717 (quoting Warch v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., 435 F.3d 510, 520 (4th Cir. 2006)). In a FMLA retaliation action, "direct evidence must demonstrate that an adverse employment action was actually 'due to . . . FMLA leave as opposed to some other lawful reason.'" Sharif, 841 F.3d at 205 (citing Laing, 703 F.3d at 718 n.1).
Here, Plaintiff argues that her FMLA retaliation claim is demonstrated through direct evidence. ECF No. 52 at 25-26. Plaintiff contends that her claim survives summary judgment because there is direct evidence that her position was eliminated earlier than planned because she was forced to take FMLA and short-term disability leave. Id. In support of her claim, Plaintiff points to an internal investigation report dated December 23, 2019, in which an internal Norfolk Southern investigator states that:
Plunkett stated that due to her extended absence, Price's job duties have been permanently moved to the Engineering department. That move was an option the Sourcing department was exploring [*15]  prior to Price's absence as part of the restructure, but they implemented the plan earlier than expected as her work was not getting done timely.
ECF No. 52, attach. 10 at 2. When asked about this in his deposition, Plunkett confirmed that the internal report was a true reflection of what he stated. ECF No. 38, attach. 6 at 13 (Plunkett Dep. 47:19-49:1).
To rebut Plaintiff's direct evidence, Norfolk Southern points to deposition testimony from Zillioux who stated that he did not agree that Plaintiff's position was eliminated because she was out on FMLA. Zillioux testified that:
I'm speculating why [Plunkett] or whoever said that, simply was because we were on a timeline exploring to outsource it. We were getting close, but we weren't there yet with this third-party. We had to enter into contract negotiations, and who knows how long that takes. When Engineering found out we were looking into that, they volunteered to take it and, boom, there it was. That's what made it earlier than expected; it had nothing to do with [Price] being there or not, because we were expecting [Price] to come back to work once FMLA ended.
ECF No. 38, attach. 3 at 13 (Zillioux Dep. 46:21-47:24).
Accordingly, Plaintiff [*16]  has presented direct evidence that Norfolk Southern transferred her job duties and eliminated her position in December 2019 because Plaintiff was out on FMLA leave. ECF No. 52, attach. 10 at 2. Although Norfolk Southern points to Zillioux's testimony that the transfer of Plaintiff's job duties and the elimination of Plaintiff's job had nothing to do with Plaintiff being out on FMLA leave, Plunkett's and Zillioux's inconsistent testimony creates a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Norfolk Southern transferred her job duties in December 2019 because she took FMLA leave.
Norfolk Southern contends it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim because "there is no evidence that the elimination of Plaintiff's position was causally (directly or indirectly) connected to her FMLA leave." ECF No. 38 at 38-39. However, for the reasons stated above, including Plunkett's statement that the elimination of Plaintiff's position was done "earlier than expected," is at least some evidence that Plaintiff's job duties were transferred in December 2019 because Plaintiff was out on FMLA leave. Additionally, Norfolk Southern argues that Plaintiff cannot establish causation [*17]  through temporal proximity. ECF No. 38 at 38-39. But Plaintiff need not establish causation through temporal proximity when she has presented direct evidence of retaliation. See Sharif, 841 F.3d at 203 (noting that only under the McDonnell Douglas framework must Plaintiff establish a prima facie case of retaliation).
Norfolk Southern also argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because it contemplated transferring Plaintiff's duties and eliminating her position before she took FMLA leave. ECF No. 55 at 22-23. Relying on the Fourth Circuit's decision in Fry v. Rand Construction Corporation, Norfolk Southern contends that "an employer 'proceeding along lines previously contemplated, though not yet definitively determined, is no evidence whatever of causality.'" Id. (citing Fry, 964 F.3d at 248). Norfolk Southern argues that the record demonstrates that it contemplated eliminating Plaintiff's position as early as May 2019. Id. (citing ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 85-86). However, Fry is distinguishable for several reasons. First, in Fry, the employer contemplated firing the employee due to performance issues before she took FMLA leave, and that decision was only "definitively determined" after she took FMLA leave. 964 F.3d at 248. The Fourth Circuit found that the [*18]  timing of the plaintiff's termination after she took FMLA leave was "no evidence whatever" that FMLA leave was the real reason for her termination. Id. Thus, in Fry, there was no evidence that the FMLA leave was connected to the retaliatory event. Id. Here, there is some evidence that the FMLA leave was connected to the transfer of Plaintiff's job duties—namely, Plunkett's statement that it was connected. Moreover, Norfolk Southern has not presented any evidence of when it would have transferred Plaintiff's job duties or eliminated her position as previously contemplated, had she not taken FMLA leave. Instead, Norfolk Southern only represents that it would have occurred at some unstated time in the future.
While Plaintiff's job was ultimately being "considered" for elimination as far back as May 2019, and likely would have been eliminated at some point in the future, at least one Norfolk Southern employee, Plunkett, stated at the time, and confirmed at his deposition, that it was done sooner than expected because Plaintiff was out on FMLA leave. Under these circumstances, the Court FINDS that Plaintiff has demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her position was eliminated [*19]  in retaliation for her taking FMLA leave. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Norfolk Southern's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to Count I be DENIED.

C. Discrimination and Retaliation in Violation of the ADA (Count III)
Count III of Plaintiff's Complaint raises claims for discrimination and retaliation in violation of the ADA. According to Plaintiff, Count III arises out of the transfer of her job duties and the elimination of her Sourcing Supervisor position in December 2019. ECF No. 52 at 25-26. With respect to Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim, Norfolk Southern argues that Plaintiff is not disabled, and she cannot demonstrate a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. ECF No. 38 at 35. As to her retaliation claim, Norfolk Southern argues that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that any retaliatory activity was connected to her protected activity. Id.
The ADA makes it unlawful to discriminate "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA Amendments [*20]  Act ("ADAAA"), which became effective January 1, 2009, amended the ADA with the purpose of expanding the definition of disability such that it "shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under this chapter, to the maximum extent permitted by [its] terms." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A). When Congress enacted the ADAAA, Pub.L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553, it indicated that one purpose of the ADAAA was "to convey that the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis" and to diminish "inappropriately high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under the ADA [before the amendments]." Pub. L. No. 110-325, § 2(b)(5); see also Summers v. Altarum Inst., Corp., 740 F.3d 325, 329 (4th Cir. 2014) (explaining the history and purpose of the ADAAA). Discrimination or retaliation based on disability may be establish through direct evidence or through the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 572, 577 (4th Cir. 2015). Here, Plaintiff appears to argue that her ADA discrimination and retaliation claims are established through direct evidence. See ECF No. 52 at 25-26.
1. Direct Evidence of Discrimination or Retaliation Based on Disability
"Direct evidence is evidence of conduct or statements that both reflect directly the alleged discriminatory attitude and that bear directly on the contested employment [*21]  decision." Cole v. Family Dollar Stores of Md., Inc., 811 F. App'x 168, 175 (4th Cir. 2020) (internal quotations omitted). With direct evidence, no inference is required. Ramseur v. Concentrix CVG Customer Mgmt. Grp. Inc., 467 F. Supp. 3d 316, 323 (W.D.N.C. 2020), aff'd, 837 F. App'x 204 (4th Cir. 2021).
Plaintiff contends that Plunkett's statement that Plaintiff's job duties were permanently moved "earlier than expected" because her work was not getting done timely is direct evidence of discrimination and retaliation in violation of the ADA. ECF No. 52 at 26; ECF No. 52, attach. 10 at 2. However, while Plunkett's statement at least creates a genuine issue of fact as to whether the statement constituted direct evidence of FMLA retaliation/discrimination, Plunkett's statement does not constitute direct evidence of discrimination based on disability under the ADA. Plunkett's statement referred to Plaintiff being out on leave as the reason for the elimination of her position and said nothing about Plaintiff's medical status, disabilities, or other impairments. See O'Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., 56 F.3d 542, 548 (4th Cir. 1995) (noting that "[d]irect evidence of discrimination is evidence which, if believed, would prove the existence of a fact . . . without any inference or presumptions") (citation and internal quotations omitted), rev'd on other grounds, 517 U.S. 308, 116 S. Ct. 1307, 134 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1996). Nor did Plunkett make any statement that the elimination of her position was because Plaintiff [*22]  took a salary continuance benefit. Thus, Plunkett's statement does not establish direct evidence of discrimination or retaliation based on disability.
Accordingly, the Court FINDS that Plaintiff has failed to establish discrimination or retaliation under the ADA through direct evidence, and proceeds to consider whether Count III can survive summary judgment using the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework.
2. Indirect Evidence of Discrimination or Retaliation in Violation of the ADA
As for establishing discrimination or retaliation through the McDonnell Douglas burdenshifting framework, Plaintiff offers little by way of argument as to what facts, if any, would create a genuine issue of material fact to support claims for discrimination or retaliation in violation of the ADA. See ECF No. 52 at 25. Notably, Plaintiff does not specifically argue that her ADA discrimination and retaliation claims can be established through the McDonnell Douglas framework. However, to the extent any argument can be made that Plaintiff establishes ADA discrimination and retaliation pursuant to the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework through other portions of her brief, the Court addresses it below.

a) Indirect Evidence of Discrimination in Violation of the ADA
To [*23]  establish a prima facie case for discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she "was a qualified individual with a disability," (2) she "suffered an adverse employment action," (3) she "was satisfying [her] employer's legitimate expectations at the time of the adverse action," and (4) "the circumstances surrounding the adverse action "raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination." Ullrich v. CEXEC, Inc., 233 F. Supp. 3d 515, 530 (E.D. Va. 2017) (citing Reynolds v. Am. Nat'l Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 150 (4th Cir. 2012)). Norfolk Southern disputes the first and fourth elements of Plaintiff's prima facie case. ECF No. 38 at 32-33, 35.

i. Whether Plaintiff is a Qualified Individual With a Disability under the ADA
Plaintiff has established a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether she is a "qualified individual" with a "disability." First, there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff was a "qualified individual" under the ADA. Under the ADA, a person is a "qualified individual" if, "with or without reasonable accommodation" the individual "can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. §12111(8). A job's essential functions are "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual [*24]  with a disability holds or desires." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1). As explained by the Fourth Circuit, "Not all job requirements or functions are essential." Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 579 (4th Cir. 2015). Job functions are "essential when 'the reason the position exists is to perform that function,' when there aren't enough employees available to perform the function, or when the function is so specialized that someone is hired specifically because of his or her expertise in performing that function." Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.0(n)(2)).
Norfolk Southern contends that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual because she took the benefit of salary continuance from Norfolk Southern which by definition demonstrates that she is not a qualified individual under the ADA. ECF No. 55 at 19. Norfolk Southern's salary continuance policy states "[i]t is the policy of Norfolk Southern . . . to continue payment of salary up to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks to . . . employees . . . who are unable to perform their assignment with or without accommodation, because of illness or injury." ECF No. 52, attach. 26 at 15 (emphasis added). Norfolk Southern contends that because Plaintiff received salary continuance, Norfolk Southern did not consider Plaintiff as a "qualified individual" with a disability [*25]  under the ADA. ECF No. 55 at 19-20.
Plaintiff has proffered evidence that she was always able to work, but instead Norfolk Southern "forced" her to take FMLA leave. ECF No. 52 at 26 n.5, 27. On November 11, 2019, Plaintiff emailed Plunkett and stated "I will be talking half days beginning today, for medical reasons. I have a follow up appointment on Wednesday the 13th ... if unable to work at all I will take full days. If I can perform my 1/2 day duties, without being in the office, I will let you know." ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 23-24. Plunkett responded stating that "working from home is not an option at this time." Id. Later that same day, Plaintiff informed Plunkett that she would need half days until November 15, 2019, and a half day November 18 and 19, 2019, "if needed." Id. at 20-21. Plunkett's responded and stated:
We have reached out to Dr. Francesa Litow (Norfolk Southern's Chief Medical Officer) this morning. It is important that you are taking care of your health before anything else. If you are not able to make it into the office full time, you should stop working and focus on your health. We cannot support you working from home while you are not well. If your doctor has [*26]  advised you to stop driving and to cut back on your work hours, you will need to provide documentation to our medical department for their review immediately.
Id. at 20. According to Plaintiff, she was able to perform the essential functions of her position with a temporary accommodation of working half days from home for three weeks. ECF No. 52 at 22-23.
Norfolk Southern appears to contend that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her job, and that working from home was not an option for her. Plaintiff contends that she would have been able to continue working had she been permitted to work half days from home. Neither party has proffered sufficient evidence to establish what the essential functions of Plaintiff's position were. Thus, there are questions of fact regarding what the essential functions of Plaintiff's job were, and whether she could have performed those essential functions while working half days from home. Accordingly, there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff is a "qualified individual" under the ADA.
Second, for the purposes of her prima facie case, Plaintiff has established that she has a "disability" within the meaning [*27]  of the ADA. Under the ADA a person is disabled if he or she meets one of the following three definitions of disability: (1) "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual"; (2) "a record of such an impairment"; or (3) "being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Under the first definition, "major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). Accordingly, "having a 'physical or mental impairment' is not sufficient on its own to establish an ADA-cognizable disability, nor is showing that the impairment affects 'one or more major life activities[]"'—rather, "[a]n individual must also show she is 'substantially limit[ed]' as a result of the impairment." Anderson v. Discovery Commc'ns., LLC, 517 F. App'x 190, 194 (4th Cir. 2013) (citing Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999) (last alteration in original)). Further, an impairment that is "episodic or in remission" constitutes a disability under the ADA so long as when it is active it would substantially limit a major life activity. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(D).
At her deposition, Plaintiff testified [*28]  that she is disabled due to anxiety, depression, and migraines. ECF No. 38, attach. 7 at 50 (Price Dep. 197:19-23). However, when asked if her anxiety and depression limit her in any way, Plaintiff responded "no." Id. at 51 (Price Dep. 198:4-6). As for her migraines, Plaintiff explained that her migraines "exasperated in November 2019," and that they "can" limit her because she is "very sensitive to light and sound" and she began "to lose vision in [her] right eye" when she got a migraine. Id. at 51 (Price Dep. 198:2-3, 7-12). In discussing her disabilities, Plaintiff also stated that her ENT issues are "severe," and she additionally was diagnosed with "Samter's Triad." ECF No. 38, attach. 7 at 58 (Price Dep: 227:9-22.
Here, Plaintiff conceded that her anxiety and depression do not substantially limit one or more of her major life activities, and therefore, those impairments do not render her disabled within the meaning of the ADA. However, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, and construing the definition of disability broadly as required by the ADA, Plaintiff has proffered sufficient evidence that her migraines, which cause sensitivity to light and sound, [*29]  and vision loss, as well as her ENT issues which cause significant pain, do substantially limit one or more major life activities. The Court FINDS that Plaintiff has established a genuine dispute of material fact whether she is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA.

ii. Whether the Circumstances of the Adverse Employment Action Raise a Reasonable Inference of Unlawful Discrimination.
As for the fourth element, whether the circumstances of her discharge raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination, Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case. As explained by the Fourth Circuit, "[t]o establish a discrimination claim pursuant to the ADA, a party must establish his disability was the 'but-for' cause of an adverse employment decision." Davis v. W. Carolina Univ., 695 F. App'x 686,688 (4th Cir. 2017) (citing Gentry v. E. W. Partners Club Mgmt. Co., 816 F.3d 228,235 (4th Cir. 2016)). A mixed motive, where the employer has both a discriminatory and nondiscriminatory reason, is not sufficient in a disability action. Id. Stated differently, "causation requires disability to be more than a motivating factor: it must be the only motivating factor." Id. (emphasis in original).
Thus, to defeat summary judgment, Plaintiff must establish that her disability was the "but-for" cause of Norfolk Southern's [*30]  decision to eliminate her Sourcing Supervisor position. Plaintiff has not established that her disability was the only motivating factor behind Norfolk Southern's decision to eliminate her position. See Blanch v. Hexagon U.S. Fed., Inc., No. 1:17-cv-613, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177281, 2018 WL 4997644, at *10 (E.D. Va. Oct. 15, 2018) (noting that an employee who meets her employer's legitimate expectations "may be terminated under a number of circumstances that utterly fail to raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination," including "because of corporate restructuring, budget cuts or outsourcing of [her] job."). Instead, Norfolk Southern has proffered evidence that demonstrates it was considering eliminating Plaintiff's position as far back as May 2019. While Plaintiff has proffered evidence that the decision to eliminate her position was done so because she took leave, she has not connected that decision to her alleged disabilities—migraines and ENT issues. Accordingly, the Court FINDS that Plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff's disabilities were the but-for cause Norfolk Southern's of decision to eliminate Plaintiff's position. Because Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination pursuant to the ADA, the Court RECOMMENDS that Norfolk Southern's [*31]  Amended Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the ADA discrimination claim in Count III be GRANTED.

b) Indirect Evidence of Retaliation in Violation of the ADA
Retaliation is unlawful under the ADA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a), which states "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). "To establish a prima facie retaliation claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove (1) [s]he engaged in protected conduct, (2) [s]he suffered an adverse action, and (3) a causal link exists between the protected conduct and the adverse action." Reynolds v. Am. Nat. Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 154 (4th Cir. 2012); Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 577 (4th Cir. 2015); see also Coursey v. Univ. of Maryland E. Shore, 577 F. App'x 167, 175 (4th Cir. 2014) (McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework applies to claims of retaliation under the ADA). Unlike claims for discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff need not show she is a qualified individual with a disability for a retaliation claim under the ADA. Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 577 (citing Rhoads v. FDIC., 257 F.3d 373, 391 (4th Cir. 2001)). Norfolk Southern disputes the first and third elements of Plaintiff's prima facie case. ECF No. 38 at 32-33, 35.

i. Whether Plaintiff Engaged in Protected Activity [*32]  Under the ADA
As for the first element of Plaintiff's prima facie case, despite the myriad of claims Plaintiff makes, she does not articulate what protected activity she engaged in specifically related to her disability. Plaintiff states that she engaged in "ample acts of alleged protected activity by reporting perceived discrimination to the terminating officials in management and HR." ECF No. 52 at 27. However, specifically related to her ADA claim, the only conceivable protected activity Plaintiff engaged in is requesting an accommodation under the ADA. Smith v. CSRA, 12 F.4th 396, 416 (4th Cir. 2021) (recognizing that a request for an accommodation is protected activity under the ADA). Assuming Plaintiff intended to identify her request for an accommodation as protected activity, she sufficiently engaged in protected activity under the ADA.

ii. Causal Link between Plaintiff's Request for an Accommodation and Adverse Employment Action
Regarding the third element of Plaintiff's prima facie case, Plaintiff has established a genuine issue of material fact regarding a causal link between her request for an accommodation and an adverse employment action.6 "[E]stablishing a causal relationship at the prima facie stage 'is not an onerous [*33]  burden.'" Strothers v. City of Laurel, Md., 895 F.3d 317, 335 (4th Cir. 2018) (citing Foster v. Univ. of Md.-Eastern Shore, 787 F.3d 243, 251 (4th Cir. 2015) and Burgess v. Bowen, 466 F. App'x 272, 282 (4th Cir. 2012) (noting that "very little evidence of causation is required to establish a prima facie case of retaliation")). "An employee may establish prima facie causation simply by showing that (1) the employer either understood or should have understood the employee to be engaged in protected activity and (2) the employer took adverse action against the employee soon after becoming aware of such activity." Id. at 335-36. However, when "mere temporal proximity" is used to establish causation for a prima facie case, "the temporal proximity must be very close." Wilcox v. Lyons, No. 7:17-CV-530, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177281, 2018 WL 1955826, at *2 (W.D. Va. Apr. 25, 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001), aff'd, 970 F.3d 452 (4th Cir. 2020); Hoyle v. Freightliner, LLC, 650 F.3d 321, 337 (4th Cir. 2011) (noting that closeness in time "far from conclusively establishes the requisite causal connection" but does satisfy "the less onerous burden of making a prima facie case of causality.") (citation and quotation omitted).
Here, Plaintiff first requested an accommodation at the latest7, on November 18, 2019, when her physician submitted a letter to Norfolk Southern stating that Plaintiff was undergoing ENT treatment, and that she "recommend[s] that [Plaintiff] work half days for the next 3 weeks, with the accommodation of being allowed to work from home. This will allow her [*34]  to remain productive while waiting for some diagnostic test results to come back in for some treatment decisions to be made." ECF No. 52, attach. 20 at 2. The adverse action—the transfer of Plaintiff's job duties to Atlanta—occurred as of December 5, 2019. ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 17. Accordingly, Plaintiff has established that less than three weeks after she requested an accommodation, her job duties were transferred to Atlanta. Three weeks is sufficient temporal proximity to create a genuine issue of material fact as the causation element of Plaintiff's prima facie case. See e.g., Foster, 787 F.3d at 247 (finding that complaints of discrimination made one month before an employee's termination was sufficient to raise a factual dispute at the prima facie stage). For these reasons, the Court FINDS that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Norfolk Southern knew Plaintiff requested an accommodation to work from home and retaliated against her for such activity. Accordingly, the Court additionally FINDS that Plaintiff has created a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether she establishes a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA.

iii. Norfolk Southern's Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory [*35]  Reason & Plaints Evidence of Pretext
Because Plaintiff has demonstrated a prima facie case, Norfolk Southern must have a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for taking adverse action—here, transferring Plaintiff's job duties to Atlanta. Norfolk Southern argues that its legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for transferring Plaintiff's job was because her position "was part of a 'clean sheeting' process and those duties [Plaintiff] performed that were not automated were absorbed by another department." ECF No. 38 at 36 (citing ECF No. 38, attach. 3 at 12 (Zillioux Dep. 44:12-24); ECF No. 38, attach. 6 at 13, 25 (Plunkett Dep. at 48:5-49:1, 97:7-15)). A reduction in force is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for taking an adverse employment action. Propst v. HWS Co., 148 F. Supp. 3d 506, 525-26 (W.D.N.C. 2015) (citing cases).
Because Norfolk Southern has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for transferring her job duties, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to demonstrate that Norfolk Southern transferred her job duties because she requested an accommodation. At the pretext stage, a plaintiff must prove that retaliation was a but-for cause of the adverse employment action. Foster, 787 F.3d at 252. To carry this burden, a plaintiff must "establish both that the [*36]  employer's reason was false and that [retaliation] was the real reason for the challenged conduct." Fry v. Rand Constr. Corp., 964 F.3d 239, 246 (4th Cir. 2020) (alteration in original and internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Foster, 787 F.3d at 252).
Plaintiff does not make any argument why, with respect to her ADA retaliation claim, Norfolk Southern's reason for transferring and eliminating her position was pretext for retaliating against her for requesting an accommodation.8 See ECF No. 52 at 25-26. Accordingly, the only evidence that Norfolk Southern retaliated against Plaintiff for requesting an accommodation is temporal proximity. In the absence of further evidence of retaliatory animus, at the pretext stage, temporal proximity is insufficient. Nathan v. Takeda Pharm. Am., Inc., 890 F. Supp. 2d 629, 648 (E.D. Va. 2012) (citing Williams v. Cerberonics, Inc., 871 F.2d 452, 457 (4th Cir. 1989)).
Accordingly, the Court FINDS that Plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine dispute of material fact that Norfolk Southern's reason for transferring and eliminating her position was a pretext for retaliation based on Plaintiff's request for an accommodation. The Court therefore RECOMMENDS that Norfolk Southern's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the ADA retaliation claim in Count III be GRANTED.

D. Failure to Accommodate in Violation of the ADA (Count IV)
Count IV of Plaintiff's [*37]  Complaint alleges failure to accommodate in violation of the ADA. Plaintiff contends this cause of action arises out of Norfolk Southern's denial of her request for part-time telework in November 2019, and Norfolk Southern "forcing [Plaintiff] to take medical leave," which resulted in the elimination of her position. ECF No. 52 at 17-18. Norfolk Southern argues that Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim fails because she is not disabled, but nonetheless, was provided an accommodation. ECF No. 38 at 32-33.
Under the ADA, employers must make reasonable accommodations to "the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified [employee] with a disability." Laird v. Fairfax Cnty., 978 F.3d 887, 892 (4th Cir. 2020) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). To establish a claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA, Plaintiff must show the following: "that [s]he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the employer had notice of [her] disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation [s]he could perform the essential functions of the position; and (4) that the employer refused to make such accommodation." Wirtes v. City of Newport News, 996 F.3d 234, 238-39 (4th Cir. 2021) (internal quotations omitted) (citing Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013)) (cleaned up) (quoting Rhoads v. FDIC, 257 F.3d 373, 387 n.11 (4th Cir. 2001)). Norfolk Southern argues that Plaintiff was not [*38]  a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA, that Norfolk Southern did not have notice of her disability, and that nonetheless, Plaintiff was provided an accommodation.9 ECF No. 55 at 17-23.
1. There are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff was a qualified individual with a disability.
The ADA defines "qualified individual" as one "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that [the] individual holds or desires. . . . [a]nd it defines a 'disability' to include 'a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities." Laird v. Fairfax Cty., 978 F.3d 887, 892 n.2 (4th Cir. 2020) (first alteration in original) (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(8) and 12102(1)(A), respectively). As explained above in Section C.2.a.i, Plaintiff has demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA.10
2. Norfolk Southern's Notice of Plaintiff's Disability.
An employee seeking an accommodation need not specifically mention the ADA or use the specific phrase "reasonable accommodation." EEOC v. Fed. Express Corp., 513 F.3d 360, 369 n.5 (4th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). "Adequate notice simply informs the employer of both the disability and the employee's need for [*39]  the accommodations for that disability." Id. Thus, the employee's burden to provide notice "is not a great one." Nonetheless, "[v]ague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations under the ADA.'" Rock v. McHugh, 819 F. Supp. 2d 456, 473 (D. Md. 2011) (quoting Huppenbauer v. May Dep't Stores Co., 99 F.3d 1130 (4th Cir. 1996) (unpublished table opinion) (alteration in original)). There are no "magic words" to satisfy the notice requirement. Sydnor v. Fairfax Cnty., Va., No. 1:10CV934, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22287, 2011 WL 836948, at *7 (E.D. Va. Mar. 3, 2011), rev'd on other grounds, 681 F.3d 591, 593 (4th Cir. 2012).
For example, courts have found the notice requirement satisfied even where the employee did not provide "crystal-clear information regarding [the p]laintiff's exact prognosis." Id. There, the employer "knew the [p]laintiff had foot surgery that resulted in limited functioning upon her return to work, such that some accommodation would be needed for her to continue working." Id. (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States EEOC v. CACI Secured Transformations, LLC, the court denied summary judgment on a failure to accommodate claim, in part because "a reasonable factfinder could conclude [the employee] cleared the low bar for communicating the need for an accommodation of her disability." No. CV JKB-19-2693, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87964, 2021 WL 1840807, at *10 (D. Md. May 7, 2021). There, the evidence included an email stating the employee was "experiencing [*40]  issues with significant increases in headaches and pain severity" and identified "some accommodations/restrictions recommended by her neurologist," and offered to provide such documentation. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87964, [WL] at *11 (internal quotations omitted). It also included another email that stated that the employee provided documentation from her doctor "summarizing accommodations/restrictions for her work environment, which is [sic] not available at the [] office." Id. (sic in original). The court held that those two emails "informed [d]efendants of both [the employee's] disability and [her] need for accommodation for that disability." Id. (last alteration in original) (citing Rock, 819 F. Supp. 2d at 473). On the other hand, the Fourth Circuit has held that an employer did not have sufficient notice where although the employer knew the employee was diabetic, the employer did not know that the employee was suffering from acute impairments caused by his diabetes, and the employee did not request an accommodation because of his diabetic condition and disability. Schneider v. Giant of Md., LLC, 389 F. App'x 263, 269 (4th Cir. 2010) (unpublished).
Plaintiff argues that her "medical documentation within the FMLA and ADA accommodation process" establishes notice. ECF No. 52 at 22. By way of background, Plaintiff initially [*41]  requested to work half-days from home on November 11, 2019, "for medical reasons." ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 23-24. That same day, Plunkett responded and told Plaintiff that "working from home is not an option at this time." Id. Later that day Plunkett told Plaintiff "if you are not able to make it into the office full time, you should stop working and focus on your health. We cannot support you working from home while you are not well" and advised her to provide documentation for the medical department to review "immediately." ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 20. Norfolk Southern Health Services sent Plaintiff an FMLA application that same day. ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 26.
On November 18, 2019, Plaintiff's physician submitted a letter to Norfolk Southern, dated November 14, 2019, stating that Plaintiff:
is presently undergoing evaluation and treatment for some ear nose and throat issues. I recommend that she work half days for the next 3 weeks, with the accommodation of being allowed to work from home. This will allow her to remain productive while waiting for some diagnostic test results to come back in for some treatment decisions to be made.
ECF No. 52, attach. 20 at 2. Norfolk Southern confirmed [*42]  receipt of the letter in her medical case file and made a notation directed at Adam Krasnoselski to "[p]lease review statement from provider requesting accommodation. EE is seeking accommodation." ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 40. On November 19, 2019, Adam Krasnoselski noted in Plaintiff's file: "EE informed by Mr. Corey Plunkett on November 14, 2019[,] via email that working from home currently is not an option when EE requested an accommodation." Id. at 38.
While Plaintiff's initial request to Plunkett asking to work from home half-days due to "medical issues" may not have been sufficient notice under the ADA, Plaintiff has established that as of November 19, 2019, when Norfolk Southern received the letter from Plaintiff's physician, it had sufficient notice under the ADA of Plaintiff's disability and request for an accommodation.11 Like in United States EEOC v. CACI Secured Transformations, "a reasonable factfinder could conclude" that Plaintiff "cleared the low bar for communicating the need for an accommodation of her disability," by providing a letter that she was experiencing ENT issues and needed to work from half-days for several weeks. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87964, 2021 WL 1840807, at *10-11. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable [*43]  to Plaintiff as the non-moving party, Plaintiff has demonstrated genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Norfolk Southern had notice of Plaintiff's disability.
3. Whether Plaintiff was Reasonably Accommodated
The fourth element in a failure to accommodate claim is the employer's refusal to make reasonable accommodations. Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 346 (4th Cir. 2013). Under the ADA, "'reasonable accommodations' may comprise 'job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules,' 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B), and 'permitting the use of accrued paid leave or providing additional unpaid leave for necessary treatment . . . .' 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o) (Appendix) (2011)." Id. at 344-45. The reasonable accommodation must "enable a disabled employee to perform essential job functions." Merrill v. McCarthy, 184 F. Supp. 3d 221, 238 (E.D.N.C. 2016) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii)). The ADA does not require an employer to "'provide a disabled employee with a perfect accommodation or an accommodation most preferable to the employee.'" Marsh v. Virginia Dep't of Transp., No. 6:14-CV-6, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167333, 2014 WL 6833927, at *6 (W.D. Va. Dec. 3, 2014) (emphasis in original) (quoting Fink v. Richmond, 405 F. App'x 719, 723 (4th Cir. 2010) (per curiam)); Smith v. CSRA, 12 F.4th 396, 414 (4th Cir. 2021) ("an employer is not required to provide 'the exact accommodation that the employee requested,' and in the alternative may provide 'an alternate reasonable accommodation' at its discretion.") (quoting Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cty., 789 F.3d 407, 415 (4th Cir. 2015)).
"The failure-to-accommodate inquiry generally proceeds in two steps: (1) was the specific accommodation [*44]  that the disabled employee requested reasonable? and (2) if the employer granted the reasonable accommodation, could the disabled employee perform the essential functions of the job?" Allen v. City of Raleigh, 140 F. Supp. 3d 470, 482-83 (E.D.N.C. 2015) (citing Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 580-81 (4th Cir. 2015)). Accordingly, "[i]mplicit in the fourth element is the ADA requirement that the employer and employee engage in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation." Haneke v. Mid-Atlantic Capital Mgmt., 131 F. App'x 399, 400 (4th Cir. 2005). Generally, an employee's communication to an employer that he or she has a disability and needs an accommodation triggers the duty of the employer to engage in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation. Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 346 (4th Cir. 2013). Such an interactive process "involves an informal dialogue between the employee and the employer in which the two parties discuss the issues affecting the employee and potential reasonable accommodations that might address those issues," as well as "bilateral cooperation, open communication, and good faith." Allen v. City of Raleigh, 140 F. Supp. 3d 470, 483 (E.D.N.C. 2015) (citation and internal quotation omitted); see also Wilson, 717 F.3d at 346 (noting that the interactive process "should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations."). Courts must carefully review the interactive process [*45]  in evaluating a claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA. Allen, 140 F. Supp. 3d at 483.
Some courts have held that "a request for FMLA leave may serve as a request for a reasonable accommodation" and recognized that temporary leave may constitute a reasonable accommodation. See Jackson v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., No. CV RDB-21-0426, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72414, 2022 WL 1172319, at *10-11 (D. Md. Apr. 20, 2022) (emphasis added); but see Burton v. Maximus Fed., No. 3:20CV955, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64637, 2021 WL 1234588, at *5 (E.D. Va. Apr. 1, 2021) ("FMLA leave is not a reasonable accommodation under the ADA; rather it is a right enforceable under a separate statutory provision.") (citing Acker v. GM, L.L.C., 853 F.3d 784, 791 (5th Cir. 2017)). However, "granting leave is not per se a reasonable accommodation." Chalmers v. Intel Corp., No. CV-12-20, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12995, 2014 WL 358989, at *5 (D. Ariz. Feb. 3, 2014) (citing Kranson v. Fed. Express Corp., 11-CV-05826, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154473, 2013 WL 5807795 *4 n. 5 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2013). For example, "granting leave may be a reasonable accommodation when the employee cannot otherwise perform the essential functions of her position" but may not be a reasonable accommodation when the employee can. Lee v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan of the Nw., No. 3:16-CV-01991, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108183, 2018 WL 4523142, at *11 (D. Or. Apr. 9, 2018), report and recommendation adopted in part, rejected in part, No. 3:16-CV-1991, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103197, 2018 WL 3090195 (D. Or. June 20, 2018).
In applying this principle, one court held that "unpaid leave may not be reasonable when an employee specifically requests another accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of the position without missing work." Mamola v. Grp. Mfg. Servs., No. CV-08-1687, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35433, 2010 WL 1433491, at *4 (D. Ariz. Apr. 9, 2010). In that case, the employee requested to work from home while recovering from eye surgery, but his employer refused that accommodation and required him to take a leave of absence. [*46]  Id.
Norfolk Southern argues that the Court should grant summary judgment because Norfolk Southern granted her "continuous FML leave and Salary Continuance" and thus Plaintiff was accommodated. ECF No. 38 at 33. However, the ultimate question is not as simple as determining whether Plaintiff was accommodated—that accommodation must also be reasonable, and material facts remain in dispute regarding whether Norfolk Southern's granting of continuous FMLA and salary continuance was a reasonable accommodation under these circumstances. First, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Norfolk Southern's outright denial of Plaintiff's requested accommodation (to work half-days from home) was not reasonable and constituted a failure to engage in the interactive process. Here, even if Norfolk Southern did not have notice of Plaintiffs disability until receiving the letter from her doctor on November 19, 2019, Adam Krasnoselski noted "EE informed by Mr. Corey Plunkett on November 14, 2019, via email that working from home currently is not an option when EE requested an accommodation" (see ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 38), there is no evidence to demonstrate that Norfolk Southern engaged in an interactive [*47]  process to determine whether Plaintiff's requested accommodation was possible and whether it would accommodate Plaintiff's disability related to her ENT issues. See Lanir v. Yorktown Sys. Grp., Inc., 527 F. Supp. 3d 817, 821-22 (E.D. Va. 2021) ("the ADA nonetheless requires, at a minimum, that an employer forward the employee's accommodation request to the party able to provide the requested accommodation"). Norfolk Southern maintained then, and now, that employees simply were not allowed to do so at that time—without any regard to whether they could have modified any procedures to accommodate Plaintiff, as specifically contemplated by the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9) (noting reasonable accommodations may include "appropriate adjustment or modifications of . . . policies"). Accordingly, there are issues of fact whether Norfolk Southern sufficiently engaged in the interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation.
In a similar vein, issues of fact remain regarding whether granting continuous FMLA leave and salary continuance was a reasonable accommodation in this case. Plaintiff argues that she was "forced" to take continuous medical leave only because Norfolk Southern would not reasonably accommodate her request to work half days from home for three weeks. See ECF No. [*48]  52 at 27, n.6. Through the letter from her doctor in November 2019, Plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence that her request was reasonable and would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her position. Norfolk Southern has not demonstrated or argued that Plaintiff would not have been able to perform the essential functions of her position with her requested accommodation, or why such requested accommodation was not reasonable. Like in Lee, a reasonable factfinder may conclude that granting leave was not a reasonable accommodation because Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her position with a different accommodation. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108183, 2018 WL 4523142, at *11.
Finally, issues of fact remain as to whether granting Plaintiff FMLA leave and salary continuance was a reasonable accommodation because Norfolk Southern did not grant Plaintiff salary continuance based on what she alleges was her disability. Rather, Norfolk Southern denied salary continuance for Plaintiff's ENT condition and recommended she take continuous FMLA and salary continuance based on her "secondary serious health condition"—her anxiety and depression, for which she did not request an accommodation. See ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at [*49]  81.
In sum, the Court FINDS material facts remain in dispute regarding whether Plaintiff received a reasonable accommodation sufficient to meet Norfolk Southern's obligations under the ADA. While Norfolk Southern did not have an obligation to accommodate Plaintiff exactly as she requested, it did have an obligation to engage in a dialogue with Plaintiff about whether that accommodation, or another accommodation, could adequately overcome the limitations resulting from her disability, and whether she received an accommodation at all. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Norfolk Southern's Motion for Summary Judgement be DENIED with respect to Count IV.

E. Gender Discrimination in Violation of Title VII, Failure to Promote (Count VI)
Count VI of Plaintiff's Complaint alleges gender discrimination in violation of Title VII. ECF No. 1 at 23-24; Plaintiff contends that her gender discrimination claim is based on Norfolk Southern's failure to promote Plaintiff to the Manager Purchasing position in August 2019. Id.; see also ECF No. 52 at 18. Norfolk Southern first argues the Court should grant summary judgment with respect to Count VI, as well as Count VII, because Plaintiff's claims based [*50]  on gender are untimely. ECF No. 38 at 18-20. Second, Norfolk Southern argues the Court should grant summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure to promote claim because Plaintiff was not qualified for the position, and she cannot establish that she was rejected for the position under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. ECF No. 38 at 21-22; ECF No. 55 at 13-17.
1. Plaintiff's Claim is Timely
Norfolk Southern first argues the Court should grant summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's failure to promote claim because she failed to timely file an administrative charge with respect to her gender-based claims.12 ECF No. 38 at 18-20. A plaintiff filing a complaint of discrimination in federal court must timely exhaust her administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). Dolgaleva v. Va. Beach City Pub. Sch., 364 F. App'x 820, 824 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 228 F.3d 503, 506 (4th Cir. 2000), rev'd on other grounds, 535 U.S. 106, 122 S. Ct. 1145, 152 L. Ed. 2d 188 (2002)). Generally, Title VII provides a 180-day time limit in which a plaintiff must file a charge of discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). However, in "deferral" states, including Virginia, a plaintiff has 300 days to file a charge of discrimination. Id.; Dolgaleva, 364 F. App'x at 824.
Here, Plaintiff filed her charge of discrimination with [*51]  the EEOC on March 20, 2020. ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 44-47. Thus, Plaintiff's allegations must allege discrimination that occurred on or before May 25, 2019-300 days before March 20, 2020. Plaintiff's allegations of gender discrimination all occur after May 25, 2019. See ECF No. 52 at 18-21. Accordingly, her gender-based claims, including Count VI and Count VII, are timely.
2. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case
Norfolk Southern argues second that Plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of discriminatory failure to promote. Plaintiff does not present any direct evidence of discriminatory failure to promote, and therefore must proceed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. To establish a prima facie case for failure to promote under Title VII, a plaintiff must first establish that she "(1) is a member of a protected class; (2) applied for the position in question; (3) was qualified for the position; and (4) was rejected for the position under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination." Honor v. Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Inc., 383 F.3d 180, 189 (4th Cir. 2004) (citing Amirmokri v. Baltimore Gas and Elec. Co., 60 F.3d 1126, 1129 (4th Cir. 1995)). "The burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment 'is not onerous.'" Baka v. City of Norfolk, No. 2:19cv458, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168394, 2021 WL 3928836, at *6 (E.D. Va. July 28, 2021) (citing Evans v. Techs. Applications & Serv. Co., 80 F.3d 954, 959 (4th Cir. 1996)). If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the employer may rebut [*52]  the prima facie case by "demonstrating that the person promoted was better-qualified for the position." Honor, 383 F.3d at 189. If the employer rebuts the prima facie case, the plaintiff must present evidence to prove the employer's articulated reasons were a pretext for unlawful discrimination. Id.
Norfolk Southern does not dispute that Plaintiff is a member of a protected class or that she applied for the position in question, but argues that Plaintiff was not qualified and that her application was not rejected under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.

a) Whether Plaint was qualified for the Manager Purchasing position
A plaintiff "cannot establish her own criteria for judging her qualifications for the promotion . . . [s]he must compete for the promotion based on the qualifications established by her employer." Rigsby v. Nat'l Sch. Boards Ass'n, No. 1:19cv168, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232531, 2020 WL 7224248, at *6 (E.D. Va. Nov. 6, 2020) (citing Anderson v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 406 F.3d 248, 269 (4th Cir. 2005)). When assessing qualifications, "[i]t is the perception of the decision maker which is relevant, not the self-assessment of the plaintiff." Evans, 80 F.3d at 960-61 (citation and quotation omitted).
There are a number of material facts in dispute regarding whether Plaintiff was qualified for the Manager Purchasing position. First, Norfolk Southern argues that Plunkett's testimony establishes [*53]  that Plaintiff did not have the requisite experience for a manager position. ECF No. 38 at 21. Plunkett testified that the "core of the job" was "knowing the markets, knowing how to negotiate, [and] doing the deals." ECF No. 38, attach. 6 at 23 (Plunkett Dep. 89:19-24). According to Plunkett, Alley had that experience, but Plaintiff did not.13 Id. at 24 (Plunkett Dep. 90:7-12). However, in response, Plaintiff points to the Manager Purchasing job posting, which listed Plaintiff's job—Sourcing Supervisor—as a predecessor job to the Manager Purchasing position. ECF No. 52 at 19 (citing ECF No. 52, attach. 17). Plaintiff also contends that Norfolk Southern admitted in their answer that Plaintiff was "responsible for assisting the Sourcing Fleet Manager in purchasing new vehicles"—demonstrating that she had purchasing experience. Id. (citing ECF No. 6, ¶ 15). Norfolk Southern argues that the job description notes that the preferred level of experience was 6-10 years, the preferred education levels and majors were Bachelor's Degree in Business including Finance and Accounting course work, Supply Chain Management, or Engineering. ECF No. 55 at 15-16. However, simply because Plaintiff allegedly [*54]  does not meet the preferred education and experience (which, whether she does or not is still unclear from the record) does not necessarily mean that she is entirely unqualified for the position, as Norfolk Southern argues. See ECF No. 38 at 21; ECF No. 55 at 16 (arguing that Norfolk Southern's witnesses explained that "under no circumstances would [Plaintiff] have been qualified for the position."). Accordingly, Plunkett's bare statement that Plaintiff was not qualified for the position is insufficient to establish that there are no genuine disputes of material fact regarding Plaintiff's qualifications.
Second, the parties dispute the nature of HR's assessment of Plaintiff's qualifications. According to Norfolk Southern, "HR screened all applicants before presenting the most qualified pool to the panel of decision-makers" and that Plaintiff did not make it past the initial screen because she was not qualified. ECF No. 38 at 21. On June 9, 2019, HR sent an email to Zillioux identifying "the pool [] for the B4 Manager Purchasing internal posting." ECF No. 38, attach. 1 at 5. Plaintiff was not included in the list of candidates, but Alley was in the pool. Id. According to Plunkett, [*55]  Plaintiff was not on the list because she lacked the requisite purchasing experience. ECF No. 38, attach. 6 at 11 (Plunkett Dep. 41:12-20). Thus, Norfolk Southern contends that HR did not include Plaintiff in the candidate pool because HR did not consider Plaintiff qualified for the Manager Purchasing position. In response, Plaintiff points to deposition testimony from Kendall Gayle, who was a HR Business Partner at Norfolk Southern during Plaintiffs tenure. ECF No. 52, attach. 6 at 5 (Gayle Dep. 5:20-6:10). Gayle suggested in her deposition that there were two routes in which a person could be considered for a position at Norfolk Southern. ECF No. 52, attach. 6 at 25 (Gayle Dep. 25:1-10). First, "[a]nyone that was in the department that they were applying to automatically got sent to the hiring manager for review" and that "if [Plaintiff] had applied, she would have been included." ECF No. 52, attach. 6 at 25-26 (Gayle Dep. 25:1-10, 26:1-8). Second, "if there were folks from other departments that [she] deemed to be competitive, those would get included in the candidate pool as well." Id. at 25-26 (Gayle Dep. 25:1-10). According to Plaintiff, Plunkett told her that her name had not [*56]  been included in the list of internal candidates, but Gayle told Plaintiff that her name was included in the list of candidates. ECF No. 38, attach. 7 at 53 (Price Dep. 208:16-22). However, Gayle testified that she could not recall speaking with Plaintiff about Plaintiff not receiving the Manager Purchasing position. ECF No. 38, attach. 4 at 25. Nonetheless, Norfolk Southern maintains that Plaintiff's application was not automatically in the candidate pool (as Gayle testified would likely happen) because she applied as an external candidate, and thus, HR would only have passed along her application if they deemed her qualified.14 ECF No. 55 at 15-16. Accordingly, there are disputes of fact whether Plaintiff's exclusion from the candidate pool sent to Zillioux meant that HR deemed Plaintiff unqualified for the Manager Purchasing position.
Contrary to Norfolk Southern's argument that Plaintiff has no qualifications for the Manager Purchasing position, Plaintiff has pointed to evidence that she has some of the qualifications necessary for the position to create a genuine dispute of material fact. Plaintiff's evidence satisfies the "relatively easy test" that she could establish a prima facie [*57]  case as to her qualifications. Evans, 80 F.3d at 960.

b) Whether Plaintiff was rejected for the Manager Purchasing position under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.
Norfolk Southern argues that Plaintiff cannot establish that she was rejected for the Manager Purchasing position under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. ECF No. 38 at 22; ECF No. 55 at 15-16. Specifically, Norfolk Southern contends that Plaintiff was not qualified, was not in the candidate pool sent to the decisionmakers, and because "she applied as an external candidate"—the same arguments it makes to oppose the third element of Plaintiff's prima facie case. ECF No. 38 at 22; ECF No. 55 at 13-16. To support her claim that she was rejected under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination based on sex, Plaintiff points to the fact that Norfolk Southern has changed its reasoning about its decision not to promote Plaintiff and because males in the department promote men but not women to high-ranking roles. ECF No. 52 at 20.
A plaintiff can demonstrate circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination by demonstrating that the promotion [*58]  went to a member outside the protected class instead of plaintiff. McCaskey v. Henry, 461 F. App'x 268, 270 (4th Cir. 2012). While some courts hold that a plaintiff must also show that the person who was ultimately selected outside the protected class must also have lesser qualifications, see Baka v. City of Norfolk, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168394, 2021 WL 3928836, at *6 ("Hiring a less qualified person outside of the protected class can establish an inference of discrimination"), the Court FINDS that Plaintiff has established an unlawful inference of discrimination for purposes of this motion and her prima facie case because establishing a prima facie case in a failure to promote context is a "relatively easy test."15 Evans, 80 F.3d at 960.
3. Norfolk Southern's Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reason & Plaintiff's Evidence of Pretext
Norfolk Southern states that its legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for selecting Alley is that he "previously served as a Manager of Pricing and had served in that management role longer than any of the other candidates in the Candidate Pool," and he was in the same pay band as the position at issue."16 ECF No. 55 at 16-17. "Job performance and relative employee qualifications are widely recognized as valid, non-discriminatory bases for any adverse employment decision." Evans, 80 F.3d at 960. Based on Norfolk Southern's explanation, [*59]  the Court FINDS that Norfolk Southern has met its burden under McDonnell Douglas from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for selecting Alley sufficient to rebut Plaintiff's prima facie case. See id. Accordingly, the Court will consider whether Plaintiff has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to demonstrate discrimination based on her gender. Merritt v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., 601 F.3d 289, 294 (4th Cir. 2010).
At the pretext stage, a plaintiff must demonstrate, "by a preponderance of the evidence that the neutral reasons offered by the employer 'were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.'" Id. (citing Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). The final inquiry 'merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that [the plaintiff] has been the victim of intentional discrimination,' which at all times remains with the plaintiff." Id. (alteration in original) (citing Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256). As explained by the Supreme Court, "[t]he ultimate question in every employment discrimination case involving a claim of disparate treatment is whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination." Id. at 294-95 (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 153, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); see also Proud v. Stone, 945 F.2d 796, 798 (4th Cir. 1991) ("Courts must, however, resist the temptation to become so entwined in the intricacies of the proof scheme that they forget [*60]  that the scheme exists solely to facilitate determination of 'the ultimate question of discrimination vel non.'") (citation omitted). Accordingly, a plaintiff must show that not only was the defendant's proffered reason false, but also that the "real reason" for the employment action was gender discrimination. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). A plaintiff may do so by demonstrating that the defendant's explanation is "unworthy of credence" and may "offer other forms of circumstantial evidence sufficiently probative of intentional discrimination." Dugan v. Albemarle Cty. Sch. Bd., 293 F.3d 716, 721 (4th Cir. 2002).
As evidence that Norfolk Southern's reasons for selecting Alley were a pretext for gender discrimination, Plaintiff points to (1) the fact that Norfolk Southern has changed its reasons for not promoting Plaintiff; (2) that Alley was the fifth consecutive male to be selected for the position, and was selected by males. ECF No. 52 at 20. An employer's inconsistent explanations for employment decisions can be probative of pretext. Dennis v. Columbia Colleton Medical Center, Inc., 290 F.3d 639, 647 (4th Cir. 2002). However, "minor discrepancies that do not cast doubt on the explanation's validity" are insufficient to establish pretext. Hux v. City of Newport News, 451 F.3d 311, 315 (4th Cir. 2006). Here, Norfolk Southern has explained that it did not consider Plaintiff for the Manager Purchasing position because she [*61]  was not qualified, and because she did not apply as an internal candidate. ECF No. 55 at 16. As proffered by Norfolk Southern, those explanations are not materially inconsistent, and in fact, both could be true—Plaintiff was not considered because she was not qualified, and because she did not apply internally. Thus, that explanation does little to establish that Norfolk Southern's reasons for failing to promote Plaintiff were inconsistent, but more importantly, does little to establish that Norfolk Southern's reasons for failing to promote Plaintiff were because of her gender.
Plaintiff's second ground for finding pretext—that Alley was the fifth consecutive male to be selected for the position, and was selected by males, is also insufficient to establish pretext. The Fourth Circuit has held that statistics are "unquestionably relevant" and they "can provide important proof of employment discrimination" in evaluating whether a plaintiff has a prima facie case or to determine pretext. Carter v. Ball, 33 F.3d 450, 456 (4th Cir. 1994). However, "[t]he usefulness of statistics depends on the surrounding facts and circumstances" and statistics "with little or no probative value" should not be considered. Id. "'[I]n a case of discrimination [*62]  in hiring or promoting, the relevant comparison is between the percentage of minority employees and the percentage of potential minority applicants in the qualified labor pool.'" Russell v. Sessions, No. 1:18-CV-163, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147802, 2018 WL 4137018, at *11 (E.D. Va. Aug. 29, 2018) (quoting Carter, 33 F.3d at 456), aff'd sub nom. Russell v. Harlow, 771 F. App'x 206 (4th Cir. 2019)). Thus, courts have held that a plaintiff relying on statistics to demonstrate discrimination in hiring or promoting must proffer evidence of the relevant labor pool to survive summary judgment. Id. (granting summary judgment because the plaintiff's evidence was insufficient to establish that "the number of female candidates selected was disproportionate compared to the number of qualified female candidates," and because plaintiff's sample size of three people was inadequate); Brown v. First Cmty. Bank, No. 7:18cv404, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183439, 2019 WL 5445300, at *7 (W.D. Va. Oct. 23, 2019) (granting summary judgment where expert provided only aggregate data on a state level was not relevant to decisionmakers' personal intentions and did not analyze the appropriate labor pool), aff'd, 814 F. App'x 788 (4th Cir. 2020); Roane v. United Airlines, Inc., No. 116cv1004, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 222003, 2017 WL 6667526, at *8 (E.D. Va. Oct. 12, 2017) (granting summary judgment where plaintiff argued that there were "no African Americans in 'upper management' of flight operations'" because plaintiff did not offer evidence of the relevant labor pool), aff'd, 738 F. App'x 806 (4th Cir. 2018); Jackson v. Richmond City Sch. Bd., No. 99-cv-642, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4474, 2000 WL 34292578, at *6 (E.D. Va. Mar. 15, 2000) (granting summary judgment where plaintiff argued that no [*63]  man ever held the position in question but did not offer evidence of the relevant labor pool—the number of qualified male applications for the position).
Here, Plaintiff simply offers the fact that Alley was the fifth consecutive male to hold the position, that he was selected by males, and that Plaintiff and another coworker found that combination made it easier for men to get promoted. ECF No. 52 at 20. Specifically, Plaintiff cites testimony from her coworker that "[i]t seemed as though the men in the organization had an easier time getting promoted . . . I definitely feel like the guys had it easier making it to high[-] ranking positions in the department." ECF No. 52, attach. 3 at 9 (Peterson Dep. 10:19-11:16"). Plaintiff's and her coworker's mere say-so that men had an easier time getting promoted is not the type of statistical evidence that can demonstrate pretext in promotion decisions. Plaintiff does not proffer any evidence of the relevant labor pool, or any expert testimony of the relevant labor pool that is sufficient to overcome summary judgment.
Ultimately, Plaintiff has not proffered sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact that Norfolk Southern's [*64]  proffered reasons for selecting Alley—that he was qualified and in the candidate pool—was false, and that the real reason for not selecting Plaintiff is because of her gender. While Plaintiff had a number of concerns regarding Alley and Scott treating her differently based on her gender, Alley did not do so until after he was promoted, and there is no allegation or evidence that Scott was involved in any decisions regarding who to select for the Manager Purchasing role. See Section F.1., infra. Norfolk Southern has proffered evidence that the decision-makers did not even consider Plaintiff for the position either because she was not qualified, and/or because she did not apply internally, and accordingly were not in a position to not select her because of her gender. The mere fact that the position has consistently been held by males does not meet Plaintiff's burden of demonstrating that Norfolk Southern did not promote her because of her gender. In sum, the Court FINDS that Plaintiff cannot establish that Norfolk Southern's reasons for promoting Alley were a pretext for gender discrimination. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Norfolk Southern's Motion for Summary Judgement be [*65]  GRANTED with respect to Count VI.

F. Count VII — Title VII Retaliation Based on Gender
Count VII of Plaintiff's Complaint arises out of her termination. Plaintiff contends that she was retaliated against "for reporting discrimination." ECF No. 52 at 18, 27-28. Norfolk Southern argues that it should be granted summary judgment on Count VII because Plaintiff did not report any discrimination and accordingly did not engage in any protected activity related to her gender, and because there is no causal link between Plaintiffs complaints which could at all be conceivably linked to gender discrimination, and any adverse employment action. ECF No. 38 at 30-31; ECF No. 55 at 25-26.
Because Plaintiff does not argue direct evidence of retaliation related to her gender, she must establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII by proving: "(1) that she engaged in a protected activity, which includes complaining to her superior about sex discrimination or harassment; (2) that her employer took an adverse action against her; and (3) that there was 'a causal link between the two events.'" Wilcox v. Lyons, 970 F.3d 452, 460 (4th Cir. 2020) (citing Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau Corp., 786 F.3d 264, 281 (4th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The plaintiff must establish causation between the employee's [*66]  complaint—not her gender—and the adverse action. Id. (citing Wetzel v. Glen St. Andrew Living Cmty., LLC, 901 F.3d 856, 868 (7th Cir. 2018)). Norfolk Southern disputes the first element—that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity regarding her gender, and the third element—that the protected activity and adverse action have a causal link.
1. Plaintiff's Protected Activity Under Title VII Related to Her Gender
To satisfy the first element of her prima facie case, Plaintiff must show that she engaged in protected activity, which "include[s] 'complaints to superiors about suspected violations of Title VII.'" Strothers v. City of Laurel, 895 F.3d 317, 328 (4th Cir. 2018). Protected activity does not need to fall within a formal proceeding, and may include "utilizing informal grievance procedures as well as staging informal protests and voicing one's opinions in order to bring attention to an employer's discriminatory activities." Laughlin v. Metro. Wash. Airports Auth., 149 F.3d 253, 259 (4th Cir. 1998). The employee cannot simply make general complaints about unfair treatment. Conyers v. Va. Hous. Dev. Auth., 927 F. Supp. 2d 285,295 (E.D. Va. 2013). Rather, the complaints must be about "activity that constitutes unlawful discrimination under Title VII." Id.
Plaintiff's claim arises out of allegations she made regarding Alley and Richard Scott. With respect to Alley, Plaintiff testified that when she would try to help Alley, he would curse at her, throw things in front [*67]  of her, and slam his keyboard down. ECF No. 38, attach. 7 at 26 (Price Dep. 98:24-99:4). She considered his behavior as harassment or bullying. Id. Plaintiff testified that her trouble with Alley "had nothing to do with the fact that she was a woman" but he did not demonstrate the same behavior towards men in the office. Id. at 28 (Price Dep. 106:12-18). Plaintiff could not recall whether Alley made any comments about the fact that Plaintiff is a woman. Id. at 28 (Price Dep. 107:3-5). As for Scott, who was the manager of fleet administration, Plaintiff testified that he "had similar if not worse behaviors" than Alley. Id. at 30 (Price Dep. 116:13-16; 31 (Price Dep. 119:9-13). Plaintiff stated that Scott would tell her that she worked for him, that he was the boss, and would get angry and talk down to her. Id. at 31 (Price Dep. 118:11-25). Plaintiff testified that her allegations about Scott included that he used language "that [she] worked for him, that [she] would do whatever the hell he said to do" and Plaintiff took issue with "[h]is lack of respect, the tone in his voice, the [] irateness" and that his behavior was "unprofessional and uncalled for." Id. at 31 (Price Dep. 119:18-120:2). [*68] 
During her deposition, Plaintiff testified that she made complaints about Alley and Scott to Plunkett and Zillioux, who were also in the Sourcing Department. For example, Plaintiff complained to Plunkett about Alley and Scott's "unwarranted outbursts of anger," and testified that Plunkett told her to "deal with it." ECF No. 38, attach. 7 at 30 (Price Dep. 115:22-116:7). Plaintiff told Zillioux about Alley and Scott's anger outbursts, and that she "did not witness that behavior when they were talking to male counterparts," and that "it was unfair to have to be subjected to that kind of behavior day in and day out." ECF No. 38, attach. 7 at 30 (Price Dep. 117:11-19). Zillioux told her she was going to have to deal with it and find a way to get along with everyone. ECF No. 38, attach. 7 at 30 (Price Dep. 116:13-20, 117:19-24). Plaintiff also spoke with Kisah Hutchinson, who was a group manager at Norfolk Southern, and told her that she "found [Alley] very difficult to work with" and that Alley got frustrated, and would throw things, and that his behavior made Plaintiff uncomfortable. ECF No. 38, attach. 7 at 18 (Price Dep. 67:11-69:14).
Plaintiff also stated that she spoke with two persons [*69]  outside her department about Alley and Scott. Plaintiff spoke with Joan Newcomb, who was the manager of the Employee Assistance Program, which primarily deals with substance abuse. Id. at 24 (Price Dep. 93:7-94:12). Plaintiff "talked to her on several occasions about Mr. Alley" because she "just needed somebody to listen and talk to." Id. at 24 (Price Dep. 94:2-95:9). Plaintiff also spoke to Caroline West, who worked as an attorney for Norfolk Southern. Id. at 34 (Price Dep. 132:9-133:20). Plaintiff testified that she pulled West aside to "talk to her about" the situation with Scott, and that she did not ask her to take any action, but spoke with her because she "needed somebody to talk to." Id. at 34 (Price Dep. 133:3-20).
Plaintiff testified that she made a formal, face-to-face complaint to Kendall Gayle in HR about Alley in late October or November 2019. Id. at 25 (Price Dep. 95:10-22). Plaintiff testified that she shared with Gayle the same information she shared with Hutchinson. Id. at 24 (Price Dep. 96:11-23). Plaintiff also testified that she made a complaint about Scott to Danielle Stephens who worked in Norfolk Southern's EEO office in late September. Id. at 35 (Price Dep. [*70]  135:6-25). Plaintiff did not make any complaints to Norfolk Southern's internal EEO office about Alley's treatment. Id. at 24 (Price Dep. 93:15-19).
Accordingly, Plaintiff has not established the first element of her prima facie case—that she engaged in protected activity under Title VII. Other than her allegation that she told Zillioux that she did not witness Alley and Scott's outbursts when they were talking to male counterparts, Plaintiff's complaints to Zillioux, Plunkett, Hutchinson, Newcomb, West, and Gayle do not establish that she raised complaints about unfair treatment because of her gender. While Plaintiff certainly complained about inappropriate workplace behavior, "[g]eneralized complaints about disputes or annoyances in the workplace are insufficient" and "Title VII does not cover . . . mistreatment in the workplace, regardless of how unfair the alleged conduct may be." Mixon v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., No. 3:11-CV-228, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124291, 2011 WL 5075808, at *4, *6 (W.D.N.C. Aug. 5, 2011), report and recommendation adopted, No. 3:11-CV-228, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124292, 2011 WL 5075622 (W.D.N.C. Oct. 26, 2011), aff'd, 473 F. App'x 271 (4th Cir. 2012). Plaintiff did not express her complaints about discrimination based on her gender to others at Norfolk Southern. Accordingly, the Court FINDS that she has failed to establish that she engaged in protected activity with respect to her gender under Title VII. [*71] 
2. Causal Link Between Plaintiff's Complaints and Her Termination.
Even if these complaints were considered protected activity under Title VII, Plaintiff could not make a prima facie case for Title VII retaliation because she cannot establish a causal link between those complaints and her termination. Temporal proximity can demonstrate a causal link when "an employer's knowledge of protected activity and the adverse employment action that follows are very closely related in time." Emami v. Bolden, 241 F. Supp. 3d 673, 681 (E.D. Va. 2017) (citing Pettis v. Nottoway Cty. Sch. Bd., 592 F. App'x 158, 161 (4th Cir. 2014)). Courts have held that a time period of three to four months is too great to establish a causal link through temporal proximity alone, but a ten-week period of time between the protected activity and the retaliation may be sufficient. Id. (citations omitted). "In cases where 'temporal proximity between protected activity and allegedly retaliatory conduct is missing, courts may look to the intervening period for other evidence of retaliatory animus.'" Lettieri v. Equant, Inc., 478 F.3d 640,650 (4th Cir. 2007) (citing Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d 271,281 (3d Cir. 2000)).
Ultimately, Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a causal link between her complaints to Norfolk Southern—the allegedly protected activity—and her ultimate termination. Plaintiff argues that she does not rest her [*72]  retaliation case on temporal proximity (ECF No. 52 at 27 n.6), but she offers no other argument why the Court should find a causal link between her complaints of gender discrimination between September and November 2019 (see, e.g., ECF No. 38, attach. 7 at 18-19 (Price Dep. 66:19-21, 69:24-70:1), 25 (Price Dep 95:17-18)), and her ultimate termination in February 2020, if not for temporal proximity. Plaintiff's allegedly protected activity occurred between September and November of 2019. ECF No. 52 at 27 n.6. According to Plaintiff, the adverse action she experienced was her termination. Id. at 26-27. Thus, Plaintiff must have some evidence to show retaliatory conduct between her protected activity and her ultimate termination. She alleges that Norfolk Southern "oversimpliff[ies] the timeline" and the Court must consider Norfolk Southern's actions between the protected activity and her ultimate termination, including her forced FMLA leave, the elimination of her Sourcing Supervisor position, and ultimately her termination. ECF No. 52 at 27 n.6. However, Plaintiff does not explain how those actions during the intervening period could or should be construed as retaliatory animus because [*73]  Plaintiff made complaints regarding gender discrimination.
Accordingly, the Court FINDS that Plaintiff has failed to establish a causal link between her allegedly protected activity and ultimate termination, and cannot establish a prima facie case of Title VII retaliation. Thus, the Court RECOMMENDS that Norfolk Southern's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED with respect to Count VII.

G. Age Discrimination in Violation of ADEA (Count VIII)
Count VIII of Plaintiff's Complaint alleges age discrimination in violation of the ADEA. Norfolk Southern first argued that Plaintiff was not actually replaced by a younger male because her job functions were absorbed by a different department. ECF No. 38 at 31-32. In response, Plaintiff argued that her ADEA claim survives summary judgment not because she was replaced by a younger male, but because the possible role she would have filled doing "special projects" was never filled after she was terminated. ECF No. 52 at 27. Norfolk Southern contends that Plaintiff improperly raised the claim that her position was left open for the first time on summary judgment, and in any event, she cannot establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. [*74]  ECF No. 55 at 11-12. Norfolk Southern disputes the fourth element of Plaintiff's prima facie case, and argues that Plaintiff was not replaced by a younger male, and argues that her "position" was not left open after her termination. ECF No. 38 at 31-32.
The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer to "discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a). Absent direct evidence, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of age discrimination by demonstrating "(1) she was older than 40; (2) she was discharged; (3) she was qualified for the job and met the defendant's legitimate expectations; and (4) her position remained open or was filled by a similarly qualified individual who was substantially younger." Kirkland v. Mabus, 206 F. Supp. 3d 1073, 1082 (E.D. Va. 2016) (citing Warch v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., 435 F.3d 510, 513 (4th Cir. 2006)). A plaintiff must also demonstrate that "but for" age discrimination, the adverse employment action would not have occurred. Id. (citing Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs. Ins., 557 U.S. 167,176, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009)). In establishing a prima facie case, "the task of the plaintiff is to prove a set of circumstantial facts which, in the absence of a legitimate non-discriminatory explanation, leads one to conclude with reasonable probability that the [*75]  adverse employment action was a product of age discrimination." Duke v. Uniroyal Inc., 928 F.2d 1413, 1418 (4th Cir. 1991).
Even assuming that Plaintiff's allegation that her position was left open after her termination were properly before the Court, Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of age discrimination based on those facts. In support of summary judgment, Norfolk Southern proffers evidence that Plaintiff's Sourcing Supervisor position was eliminated in December 2019 when it was absorbed by the Engineering Department. Specifically, Zillioux testified that Plaintiff's position as Sourcing Supervisor was "being looked at" during a department reorganization as far back as 2018. ECF No. 38, attach. 3 at 12 (Zillioux Dep. 44:7-45:24). Norfolk Southern looked to outsource her duties to a third-party, but "when Engineering found out we were looking into that, they volunteered to take it." Id. at 13 (Zillioux Dep. 47:7-24). When asked who in the engineering department took over Plaintiff's job, Zillioux testified that it he didn't know, but that he believed they worked in Richard Scott's group. Id. (Zillioux Dep. 49:12-19). Plunkett testified that "Fleet Administration was able to take over the duties [of Price's Sourcing Supervisor [*76]  position] without adding any headcount by improving the processes and system changes." ECF No. 38, attach. 6 at 25 (Plunkett Dep. 97:7-15). Plunkett further testified that when he told the engineering fleet department that they were looking to outsource Plaintiff's position to a third-party vendor, they said "with our process improvements that we've made, I think we can just absorb that without having to pay the vendor . . . [t]hey took on those duties without adding any headcount in addition to what they were already doing and with process improvements and system enhancements they were able to absorb those duties in the engineering department." ECF No. 38, attach. 6 at 13 (Plunkett Dep. 47:24-49:1). Plunkett also testified that he did not know who in the engineering department took on those duties, but that Richard Scott would know. Id. (Plunkett Dep. 49:2-6). Neither Plaintiff nor Norfolk Southern has proffered testimony from Richard Scott regarding who "absorbed" Plaintiff's duties, but Norfolk Southern has suggested her role was absorbed and automated.
Plaintiff did not argue in her opposition to summary judgment that she was replaced by a younger individual.17 ECF No. 52 at 27-28. [*77]  Instead, Plaintiff argued, for the first time, that she can establish the fourth element of her claim by demonstrating that the "special projects position was left open." Id. (citing Varma v. Dudas, No. 1:06cv421, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5028, 2007 WL 201082, at *4 (E.D. Va. Jan. 24, 2007)).
Nonetheless, Plaintiff still fails to establish that her position remained open to make a prima facie case that establishes the fourth element of her claim. In support of her contention that the "special projects" position remained open, Plaintiff cites testimony from Zillioux, wherein he was asked "With respect to the organization of the Sourcing Department after Ms. Price's employment was terminated, did anyone fill this role to help Lisa Holloman?" and he responded "No." ECF No. 52, attach. 9 at 70 (Zillioux Dep. 70:8-12). However, Plaintiff has not offered sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether this position even existed aside from finding duties for Plaintiff to perform after she returned from leave. For example, Zillioux testified that when Plaintiff's job moved to Atlanta, they "ha[d] to find something for her to do in the department" and a plan was formed to have Price work under Lisa Holloman, because they "were trying to find something . . . [*78]  for [Plaintiff] to come back to." ECF No. 38, attach. 3 at 14 (Zillioux Dep. 51:5-53:18). Zillioux explained that Plaintiffs role "would have been drawn out of . . . [the] various pockets of what Lisa Holloman worked on" but "it wasn't clear what that was going to be" and the position "would have taken shape over some time once [Plaintiff] returned." Id. (Zillioux Dep. 52:17-53:9). Plunkett testified that because Plaintiff's Sourcing Supervisor responsibilities were transferred to a different department, they "wanted to have something for her to do when she came in." ECF No. 38, attach. 6 at 15 (Plunkett Dep. 56:16-22). Accordingly, both Zillioux and Plunkett testified that there was no specific "special projects" position as Plaintiff contends. Rather, once Plaintiff's position as Sourcing Supervisor was eliminated, they planned for Plaintiff to work under the direction of Lisa Holloman when she returned from leave. Under these circumstances, Plaintiff cannot create a genuine issue of fact that what she calls the "special projects" position "remained open" to establish that she was subjected to unlawful age discrimination.
Moreover, even if she could demonstrate a prima facie case, [*79]  Norfolk Southern has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for leaving the "position" open—namely, that it simply did not exist aside from finding something for Plaintiff to do once she returned from leave. Plaintiff has not adduced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that reason is mere pretext for age discrimination. Plaintiff has offered deposition testimony from other employees at Norfolk Southern that women over the age of fifty were pushed out from the Sourcing Department. See ECF No. 52, attach. 2 at 11 (Sadler Dep. 11:19-13:30) ("after you got to your 60th birthday, they were kind of waiting for you to drop your retirement letter into the system"); ECF No. 52, attach. 4 at 14 (Brooks Dep. 14:15-23) ("I think there probably had become a pattern of age discrimination at Norfolk Southern . . . that's my opinion."); ECF No. 52, attach. 5 at 13 (Mahek Dep. 13:8-18) ("[t]here was definitely a preference for the younger generation, meaning pretty much anyone under 45"). Conclusory opinions of this sort do not reflect actual facts supporting the proposition that age was a factor in Norfolk Southern's decision to leave Plaintiff's "special projects" position open. Accordingly, that [*80]  deposition testimony is not sufficient to demonstrate pretext upon the facts that Plaintiff alleges form the basis of her claim—that the "special projects" position (which, as explained above, was not a true position at Norfolk Southern)—was left open because of her age. See Wootten v. Virginia, 154 F. Supp. 3d 322, 336 (W.D. Va. 2016) (noting that at the pretext stage, the plaintiff "must establish both that the employer's reason was false and that retaliation was the real reason for the challenged conduct,' which is effectively a 'but-for' standard" of causation).
For these reasons, the Court FINDS that Plaintiff has failed to establish the fourth element of her claim because the "special projects" position did not remain open after her termination, and therefore RECOMMENDS that Norfolk Southern's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to Count VIII be GRANTED.

H. Intersectional Discrimination Based Upon Age, Disability, and Gender, in Violation of the ADEA, ADAAA, and/or Title VII (Count IX)
Plaintiff's final claim is "intersectional discrimination" based upon "[s]ex, [disability, and [a]ge" and Title VII Retaliation. ECF No. 55 at 26. Plaintiff contends that she was unlawfully terminated and retaliated against because of the combination [*81]  of these protected characteristics. Id. at 26-30. There is no statutory authority or case authority from the Fourth Circuit regarding an "intersectional discrimination" theory. Only one district court within the Fourth Circuit has explicitly recognized and substantively analyzed such a theory. In recognizing an intersectional discrimination theory, the District of Maryland explained that:
'Intersectionality theory posits that individuals have multiple identities that are not addressed by legal doctrines based solely on a single identity or status.' Dianne Avery et al., Employment Discrimination Law 47 (8th ed. 2010). That is, 'some cases present evidence that points to discrimination occurring not only because of the plaintiffs sex, but because of both sex and some other characteristic.'[....] Although the Fourth Circuit has yet to answer this question, Mosby-Grant v. City of Hagerstown, 630 F.3d 326, 337 n.4 (2010), '[s]everal courts have been willing to embrace intersectionality theory in Title VII cases.' Avery et al., supra, at 47. The leading case for this proposition is Jefferies v. Harris Cnty. Cmty. Action Ass'n, 615 F.2d 1025, 1032 (5th Cir. 1980). The majority of federal courts have followed the Jefferies approach, including at least two circuits. See, e.g., Lam v. Univ. of Hawai 7, 40 F.3d 1551, 1561-62 (9th Cir. 1994); Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., 833 F.2d 1406, 1416 (10th Cir. 1987); Jeffers v. Thompson, 264 F. Supp. 2d 314, 327 (D. Md. 2003). Indeed, albeit in dicta, the Supreme Court has favorably cited [*82]  Jefferies for the proposition that African-American females may assert intersectional claims under Title VII. See Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 598 n.10, 119 S. Ct. 2176, 144 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1999). The Court joins this evolving body of authority and concludes that intersectional claims based on sex and race are generally cognizable under Title VII.
Westmoreland v. Prince George's Cnty., 876 F. Supp. 2d 594, 604 (D. Md. 2012). In another case arising out of the Western District of Virginia, that court held that an employer was entitled to summary judgment on an intersectional theory of discrimination because the employee failed to independently prove either a discrimination based on sex or based on religion claims. Trigiani v. New Peoples Bank, Inc., No. 1:21CV00001, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72445, 2022 WL 1174114, at *9 (W.D. Va. Apr. 20, 2022); Without any analysis of an intersectional discrimination claim, the District of South Carolina recognized that protections under Title VII may also overlap with other statutes protecting against discrimination, such as the ADA. Brown v. OMO Grp., Inc., No. 9:14-cv-02841, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45048, 2017 WL 1148743, at *5 (D.S.C. Mar. 28, 2017) ("The law also prohibits individuals from being subjected to discrimination because of the intersection of their race and a trait covered by another EEO statute—e.g., race and disability, or race and age.").
The Court is hesitant to recognize such a claim, and specifically to recognize such a claim under these circumstances. In Westmoreland, the single case in the Fourth Circuit to [*83]  recognize and analyze an intersectional discrimination claim, the District of Maryland as a preliminary matter explained that the plaintiff-employee's sex discrimination and racial discrimination theories must be taken "in tandem" because the plaintiff "consistently contend[ed]" that her employer discriminated against her as an African-American female." 876 F. Supp. 2d at 603-04. The court went on to review the plaintiff's claims under Title VII, recognizing the plaintiff's protected class as an African American female for each of her claims of sex and racial discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment. Id. at 604-16.
To the extent a claim for intersectional discrimination exists, Plaintiff's evidence does not establish it here. While the Court has recommended that summary judgment should be denied with respect to Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation and ADA failure to accommodate claims, there is not sufficient evidence that Norfolk Southern discriminated against Plaintiff due to her a combination of her age, gender, and disabilities.18 Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Norfolk Southern's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED with respect to Count IX.

V. RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons stated [*84]  above, the Court RECOMMENDS that Norfolk Southern's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment be DENIED with respect to Count I and Count IV and GRANTED with respect to Counts III, VI, VII, VIII, and IX. The Court further RECOMMENDS that Counts II and V be DISMISSED pursuant to Plaintiff's voluntarily withdrawal of those counts.
