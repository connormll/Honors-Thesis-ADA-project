Opinion


ORDER
This matter is before the court on Defendant United Methodist Retirement Homes' ("UMRH") motion for summary judgment. DE 40. UMRH argues for judgment in its favor on all claims because the Plaintiff is not a "qualified individual" under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"); she never provided a return-to-work date or medical release to return to work, and therefore any accommodation request was unreasonable; and she was fired for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons and cannot show those reasons were pretextual. Plaintiff Sheila Andrews ("Andrews") argues that summary judgment should be denied because UMRH never attempted to work with her on a reasonable accommodation, and instead, UMRH terminated her because of her disability and in retaliation for requesting a leave of absence due to her disability.
UMRH is [*2]  correct. The undisputed material facts show Andrews never provided a date when she could return to work and any requested accommodation was unreasonable because the leave sought was indefinite. Moreover, any breakdown in the ADA's interactive process was Andrews's fault because UMRH requested that she update UMRH on her disability every week and she failed to do so. Andrews does not raise any genuine issue of material fact to dispute these findings and, therefore, UMRH's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.

I. Background

a. Findings of Fact
UMRH is a nonprofit, faith-based organization, whose operations include the Cypress Glen Retirement Community. Cypress Glen is a skilled nursing and assisted living facility located at 100 Hickory Street in Greenville, North Carolina. UMRH's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Supp. of UMRH's Mot. for Summ. J. ("UMRH Statement") [DE 42] ¶ 1. Under its "Disability Policy," UMRH provides reasonable accommodations to disabled employees and forbids disability discrimination. Id. ¶ 3. UMRH provides leave to its employees as requested and appropriate under the Federal Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). Id. ¶ 4. UMRH's Attendance Policy stipulates that [*3]  employees' attendance on their scheduled shifts is crucial to UMRH's operations. Id. ¶ 5. All of these policies are set forth in UMRH's Employee Handbook, which is distributed to all UMRH employees. Id. ¶ 6.
On or about September 22, 2017, Andrews began employment with UMRH as a Licensed Practical Nurse ("LPN") Charge Nurse at Cypress Glen. Id. ¶ 7; Aff. of Sheila Andrews ("Andrews Aff.") [DE 45] ¶ 3. She acknowledged her receipt of UMRH's Employee Handbook, including UMRH's Attendance Policy. UMRH Statement ¶ 8; Andrews Aff. ¶ 5. During her employment, Andrews was generally assigned to the third shift at Cypress Glen, which began at 11:00 p.m. and ended at 7:00 a.m. UMRH Statement ¶ 9. Her responsibilities included (1) administering medication, (2) supervising Certified Nursing Assistants, and (3) overseeing the health of the residents on the second floor at Cypress Glen. Id. ¶ 11. Her direct supervisor was Sarah Everette, UMRH's Director of Health Services. Id. ¶ 10. Andrews described the work environment as "an atmosphere of teamwork" and "a beautiful atmosphere." Id. ¶ 12.
On June 22, 2020, Andrews started her shift at 11:17 a.m. and she ended her shift at 7:40 a.m. on June 23, 2020. [*4]  Id. ¶ 13. Later that day, Andrews informed Everette that she had blurry vision, was seeking medical treatment, and could not report to work for her shift later that day. Id. ¶ 14. Everette responded with concern for Andrews's well-being, excused her absence, and provided her with paid time off ("PTO"). Id. ¶ 15. The next day, Andrews informed Everette she could "tentatively" return to work on July 6, 2020. Id. ¶ 16. Everette then granted Andrews PTO on June 26, 27, and 28, as well as July 1. Id. ¶ 17. On July 1, 2020, Everett contacted Andrews to determine whether she could return to work on July 6. Id. ¶ 18. Andrews responded with a doctor's note dated July 1, 2020, which stated that Andrews was suffering from an "eye condition." Id. ¶ 19. She was scheduled for a doctor's appointment on July 6, 2020 and could "not return to work at this time." Id. The July 1, 2020 doctor's note did not include a specific date when Andrews could return to work. Id. Everette continued to inquire when Andrews could return to work. She informed Andrews that Cypress Glen had "three nurses that have requested time off next week" and asked Andrews when, specifically, she could return to work. Id. ¶ 20. Andrews [*5]  responded, "I don't know right now." Id. ¶ 21.
As of July 5, 2020, Andrews had exhausted her available PTO. Id. ¶ 22. However, UMRH continued to provide Andrews a leave of absence from work under the FMLA. Id. Andrews's leave of absence continued for another 85 days, from July 5 through September 28. Id. ¶ 23.
On July 8, 2020, Lucy Bryan, UMRH's Health Services Coordinator/Scheduler, informed Andrews she would be provided FMLA paperwork. Id. ¶ 24. Six days later, on July 14, Everette asked Andrews whether she had received the paperwork. Id. ¶ 25. Two days later, Everette sent Andrews a message stating "[w]ill you please call and give me an update on what's going on and when we can expect you to return [to work?]." Id. ¶ 26. Later that day, Bryan spoke with Andrews and confirmed that she had received the FMLA paperwork. Id. ¶ 28. Thereafter, on July 21, 2020, Everette contacted Andrews and asked her when she could return to work. Id ¶ 29. Andrews responded, "I don't have a return date right now[.]" Id. Later that day, UMRH received Andrews's FMLA paperwork, which did not state when she could return to work. Id. ¶ 30. Instead, it stated the "[p]robable duration" of Andrews's eye condition [*6]  was "[u]nclear at this time[.]" Id. ¶ 31. Her FMLA paperwork also indicated that her period of incapacity would continue into "August 2020 (maybe longer)[.]" Id. Thus, as of July 21, Andrews's medical provider did not know how long her condition would last and could not provide a return-to-work date. Id. ¶ 32.
UMRH granted Andrews's request for FMLA leave. On August 6, 2020, Teresa Lilley, UMRH's Director of Human Resources, confirmed that Andrews's request for FMLA leave had been granted. Id. ¶ 34. Lilley called Andrews because she was confused about some of the FMLA paperwork Andrews's doctor provided to UMRH. Andrews Aff. ¶ 9; Deposition of Sheila Andrews ("Andrews Dep.") [DE 43-1] at 36-37. The paperwork estimated that the beginning and end dates for Andrews's period of incapacity were "July 1st 2020—August 2020 (may be longer)" but the doctor also recommended an accommodated work schedule. DE 45-1 at 1. Lilley was confused as to whether the doctor was. saying Andrews could return to work at that time. Andrews Dep. at 37. Andrews explained that her doctor "discussed prescription glasses [with her] and he made [her] an appointment with Vision Rehab." She stated that she would "just [*7]  need a little extra time to get used to [her glasses] and then [she could] get back to work." Andrews Aff. ¶ 9; Andrews Dep. at 36. Lilley responded "yeah—that is good news. So we will talk soon, and I'm glad you're feeling better." Andrews Aff. ¶ 9. As of August 2020, Andrews was aware that she was on "family and medical leave[.]" UMRH Statement ¶ 35.
On August 10, Andrews had an appointment with Dr. Gospe at Duke Eye Care. Andrews Aff. ¶ 10. Dr. Gospe faxed an update to Everette at Cypress Glen. Id. It stated "Impression: Ms. Andrews' papilledema is substantially improved from prior and getting very close to complete resolution." Id.
On August 19, Everette sent Andrews a message, "Hi Sheila — I left you a voicemail yesterday — will you please call me with an update on how you are doing I need at least for you to call every week and let me know how you are doing[.]" UMRH Statement ¶ 36. Andrews did not respond to Everette's message. Id. ¶ 37. Throughout the remainder of Andrews's employment, she failed to provide Everette with weekly updates as to her medical condition and when she could return to work at Cypress Glen. Id. ¶ 38.
On the same day, UMRH received Andrews's doctor note dated [*8]  August 10, 2020. Id. ¶ 39. It stated that Andrews could not return to work at that time and she would be re-assessed "in 4-6 weeks[.]" Id. In response to whether her medical provider indicated that she could return to work as of August 10, Andrews testified "No[.]" Id.; Andrews Dep. at 49. Thus, as of August 19, 2020, Andrews had not reported to work in 57 days and her potential return-to-work date was still unknown. UMRH Statement ¶ 40. From August 19, through her termination on September 28, the August 10, 2020 doctor's note was the only documentation Andrews provided to UMRH regarding her potential release to return to work. Id. ¶ 41. Andrews had at least one phone call with Everette in late August or early September. Andrews Dep. at 52. During that call, Andrews informed Everett that she had an appointment scheduled on September 30, after which she would go to Vision Rehabilitation for her prescription eyeglasses, and then she could return to work. Id. Everette confirmed Andrews would not return before September 30 and ended the phone call. Id.
On September 28, 2020, Andrews's FMLA leave expired. UMRH Statement ¶ 45. At that time, her leave of absence totaled 97 days. Id. ¶ 43. [*9]  Andrews had still not provided a date when she could return to work. Id. Therefore, UMRH terminated Andrews's employment. Id. ¶ 46. UMRH asserts that it terminated her because (1) she was unable to meet her job's attendance requirement and unable to perform her job duties, (2) she had exhausted her PTO, (3) she had exhausted her FMLA leave, (4) she had not and could not provide a specific return-to-work date, and (5) she had not and could not provide a release to return to work from a medical provider. Id.
After Andrews's employment was terminated, she still did not know when she would be released to return to work. Id. ¶ 47. On October 2, UMRH received a doctor's note dated September 30, 2020, which confirmed that Andrews's medical provider was still unable to provide a date when she could return to work. Id. The note stated: "[Andrews] is recovering well, and I am hopeful that after she sees Vision Rehabilitation on 10/8/2020, she will be approaching a point where she will be able to return to work." Andrews Dep. at 51. Andrews confirmed she did not have a return-to-work date as of October 2, 2020. Id. at 51; UMRH Statement ¶ 48. Andrews also testified that on October 8 (the date [*10]  of her appointment with Vision Rehabilitation), her medical provider did not indicate when she could return to work. UMRH Statement ¶ 49. She obtained her prescription glasses on October 10, 2020, but she did not follow up with Vision Rehabilitation because she had been terminated from UMRH and no longer had health insurance. See Andrews Dep. at 55. Andrews did not apply for substitute employment until June 4, 2021, which was 249 days after her employment with UMRH ended on September 28, 2020. UMRH Statement ¶ 50.

b. Procedural History
Andrews filed her complaint on October 5, 2021, alleging failure to accommodate, wrongful discharge, and retaliation in violation of the ADA. DE 1. UMRH answered on November 30, 2021. DE 9. After discovery, UMRH filed a motion for summary judgment. DE 40. Andrews responded [DE 45] and UMRH replied [DE 46].

II. Legal Standards
"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute is "genuine" if the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to find for the nonmoving party, and "[a] fact is material if it might affect the outcome" [*11]  of the litigation. Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Off. Cts., 780 F.3d 562, 568 (4th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Substantive law determines which facts are material. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The court's role at the summary-judgment stage is not "to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Id. at 249. In doing so, the court "must view the evidence presented through the prism of the substantive evidentiary burden," id. at 254, and "resolve all factual disputes and any competing, rational inferences in the light most favorable" to the nonmoving party, Rossignol v. Voorhaar, 316 F.3d 516, 523 (4th Cir. 2003) (quoting Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., 100 F.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir. 1996)).
When the nonmovant bears the burden of proof at trial, the party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of "pointing out to the district court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the movant does so, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to point out "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)). In doing so, "the [nonmovant] must rely on more than conclusory allegations, mere speculation, the building of one inference upon another, or the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." Dash v. Mayweather, 731 F.3d 303, 311 (4th Cir. 2013). While "it is the province of the jury to resolve conflicting inferences [*12]  from circumstantial evidence," any "[p]ermissible inferences must still be within the range of reasonable probability." Ford Motor Co. v. McDavid, 259 F.2d 261, 266 (4th Cir. 1958). It is "the duty of the court to withdraw the case from the jury when the necessary inference is so tenuous that it rests merely upon speculation and conjecture." Id.
Instead, the nonmoving party must support its assertions by "citing to particular parts of . . . the record," or by "showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence . . . of a genuine dispute." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). In doing so, the nonmovant "must offer evidence that could be presented in a form that would be admissible at trial." Doe v. Meron, 929 F.3d 153, 165 (4th Cir. 2019) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2)). If the nonmovant cannot make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case, no reasonable jury could find in her favor, and summary judgment must be granted in favor of the movant. Ballengee v. CBS Broad., Inc., 968 F.3d 344, 349 (4th Cir. 2020) (quoting Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at-323). The court will liberally construe all of Plaintiff's pro se filings. See, e.g., Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) ("A document filed pro se is 'to be liberally construed.").

III. Analysis
The Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") makes it unlawful for covered employers to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). It requires that covered employers make "reasonable accommodations" for known disabilities [*13]  so long as the accommodation would not impose an "undue hardship" on the business. Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A). The ADA also prohibits retaliation against an individual who "has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter." Id. § 12203(a). Andrews brings three claims under the ADA for (1) failure to accommodate, (2) wrongful discharge, and (3) retaliation. The court will consider each in turn.

I. Failure to Accommodate

a. Legal Standards
The ADA mandates that a covered entity is prohibited from failing to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "A reasonable accommodation is one that 'enables [a qualified] individual with a disability . . . to perform the essential functions of [a] position.'" Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 580 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii)). "A job function is essential when 'the reason the position exists is to perform that function,' when there aren't enough employees available to perform the function, or when the function is so specialized that someone is hired specifically because of his or her expertise in performing that function." Id. at 579 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)). "A reasonable accommodation is one that is feasible or plausible." Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cnty., 789 F.3d 407, 414 (4th Cir. 2015) (citing U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-02 (2002)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). "Plaintiff [*14]  bears the burden of demonstrating that she could perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation." Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., Inc. of Cal., 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994).
A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case for failure to accommodate if she demonstrates "(i) she was disabled, (ii) the employer had notice of her disability, (iii) she could perform the essential functions of her position with a reasonable accommodation, and (iv) the employer refused to make such accommodation." Cowgill v. First Data Techs., Inc., 41 F.4th 370, 378 (4th Cir. 2022). Andrews satisfies elements one and two, but elements three and four are contested.
The court assesses element three in two steps. First, the court determines whether the plaintiff is able to perform the essential functions of her employment position. Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). If not, the court then determines whether the plaintiff could do the job with a reasonable accommodation. Id. at 282.1 To make this determination, the court proceeds in two steps: (1) was the specific accommodation requested by Andrews reasonable, and (2) if UMRH had granted the accommodation, could Andrews perform the essential functions of the position? Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 580.
To survive summary judgment, the plaintiff must show that the accommodation is reasonable on its face. Reyazuddin, 789 F.3d at 414 ("To overcome a motion for summary [*15]  judgment, [the plaintiff] was required to 'present evidence from which a jury may infer that the [proposed] accommodation is "reasonable on its face, i.e., ordinarily or in the run of cases."'"); see also Halpern, 669 F.3d at 464. A request for leave is reasonable on its face if it "(1) is for a limited, finite period of time; (2) consists of accrued paid leave or unpaid leave; and (3) is shown to be likely to achieve a level of success that will enable the individual to perform the essential functions of the job in question." Wilson, 717 F.3d at 345 n.7 (citing Halpern, 669 F.3d at 465-66; Myers 50 F.3d at 283). An indefinite leave of absence is an unreasonable accommodation. Myers, 50 F.3d at 283.
"The ADA imposes upon employers a good-faith duty 'to engage [with their employees] in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation."' Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 581. "This duty is triggered when an employee communicates her disability and desire for an accommodation—even if the employee fails to identify a specific, reasonable accommodation." Id. at 581; see also Wilson, 717 F.3d at 346-47. This "informal, interactive process . . . . should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). Neither party is allowed to "cause a breakdown in the process for the [*16]  purpose of either avoiding or inflicting liability." Crabill v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 423 F. App'x 314, 323 (4th Cir. 2011). A party's failure to communicate can undermine the interactive process. Id. This court will "attempt to isolate the cause of [any] breakdown [in that process] and then assign responsibility." Id. "But the interactive process 'is not an end in itself; rather it is a means for determining what reasonable accommodations are available to allow a disabled individual to perform the essential job functions of the position sought.'" Wilson, 717 F.3d at 347. Therefore, "liability for failure to engage in an interactive process depends on a finding that, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation that would enable the disabled person to perform the job's essential functions." Id.

b. Analysis
Andrews' requested accommodation of "extra time" was unreasonable because the undisputed material facts show she requested leave for an indefinite period of time. Therefore, she could not perform her job's essential attendance requirement. As a result, she is not a qualified individual under the ADA and UMRH is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Andrews's failure-to-accommodate claim. E.g., Tyndall, 31 F.3d at 213 ("An employee who [*17]  cannot meet the attendance requirements of the job at issue cannot be considered a 'qualified' individual protected by the ADA.").
During a 97-day leave of absence, Andrews never provided UMRH with a definite return-to-work date or a medical release to return to work. On June 24, 2020, Andrews informed Everette that she was uncertain as to when she could return to work. Andrews Dep. at 28:17-29:4. On July 1, Andrews sent Everette a doctor's note indicating that she could not return to work at that time and did not provide a return-to-work date. Affidavit of Sarah Everette ("Everette Aff") [DE 43-3] at 4, ¶ 16. That same day, Everette asked Andrews if she had "any idea" when she could return to work, to which Andrews responded, "I don't know right now." Andrews Dep. at 30:17-25, 31:8-13. On July 21, Everette again inquired when Andrews could return to work and she replied, "I don't have a return date right now." Andrews Dep. at 34:1-5; id. Ex. 7 at 9-10. Andrews's FMLA paperwork also indicated that the "[p]robable duration" of Andrews's eye condition was "[u]nclear at this time." Everette Aff. at 4 ¶ 19. Finally, the last doctor's note—i.e., the August 10, 2020 doctor's note—that UMRH [*18]  received during Andrews's employment did not release Andrews to return to work or include a date that she could return to work. Id. at 5, ¶¶ 23-24; Andrews Dep. at 48:20-23, 49:1-3. It stated that Andrews could not return to work. Id. In sum, Andrews never provided UMRH a return-to-work date, or a release to return to work, and she never requested an accommodation for a finite term of leave.
As a result, Andrews could not comply with an essential function of her job—attendance. Her requests for "extra time" with no return date are unreasonable as a matter of law. See Myers, 50 F.3d at 283 ("Nothing in the text of the reasonable accommodation provision requires an employer to wait an indefinite period for an accommodation to achieve its intended effect."); see also Wilson, 717 F.3d at 346 n.8 ("In leave cases, the accommodation must be for a finite period of leave. Once that period lapses, it then becomes apparent whether the withheld accommodation would have been successful or futile." (internal citation omitted)). It follows that Andrews is not a qualified individual under the ADA. Tyndall, 31 F.3d at 213 ("An employee who cannot meet the attendance requirements of the job at issue cannot be considered a 'qualified' individual protected by the ADA."); [*19]  Smith v. Noftle, No. 1:13-CV-708, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76259, 2015 WL 3675740, at *4 (M.D.N.C. June 12, 2015) ("It is well-settled that an individual who has not been released to work by his or her doctor is not a 'qualified individual with a disability.") (collecting cases).
Andrews argues that she could have performed the essential functions of her job with "extra time" to get her prescription glasses and that UMRH never engaged in the interactive process with her. On August 6, 2020, Andrews informed Lilley, Director of Human Resources at UMRH, that her papilledema was under control, she just needed to have a doctor's appointment to get prescription eyeglasses, and then she would be able to return to work. Andrews Dep. at 36-38. Lilley had called Andrews in response to FMLA paperwork she had received from Andrews's doctor. Id. at 37. The paperwork estimated incapacity from "July 1, 2020 to August 2020 (may be longer)." DE 45-1. It also stated Andrews would need an accommodation: A "part-time or reduced work schedule" of "8-12 hour(s) per day; 4-5 days per week from July 2020 through August 2020." Id. Further, it stated her condition will not cause periodic flare-ups. Id. Lilley was confused by the paperwork. She called Andrews to clarify whether she could "go back to work right now or what's [*20]  going on[?]" Andrews Dep. at 37. Andrews explained that all she had to do before she could return to work was get fitted for her prescription glasses. She explained to Lilley she hoped to "get enough time to [get fitted for prescription glasses] and then [she] [would] be able to come back to work" because her condition was "under really good control at that time." Id. However, at that time, Andrews could not provide UMRH with a return-to-work date. Id. Andrews also provided this information to Everette in late August or early September. Everette called Andrews asking when she would be able to return to work. Id. at 51-52. Andrews responded, "my last appointment with Dr. Gospe is on September 30 and soon after I'll be going to Vision Rehab to get fitted for glasses. And I only needed a couple more weeks to get fitted for my glass[es] and I[] will return[ ] to work." Id. at 52. Everette responded, "So you won't be back before September 30?" Id. Andrews replied, "No, because that's when my appointment is." Id. at 52. Everette said "Okay then. Well, thank you," and they ended the call. Id. This was Andrews last communication with UMRH before she was terminated.
Even after her termination, [*21]  Andrews still did not have a date certain when she could return to work. On October 2, 2020, UMRH received a doctor's note dated September 30, 2020, from Andrews's medical provider. UMRH Statement ¶¶ 47-48. The doctor could not provide a return-to-work date. Id. ¶ 48. Andrews also testified that at the doctor's appointment on October 8, 2020, her healthcare provider still did not provide a date when she could return to work. Id ¶ 49. UMRH contends these additional facts demonstrate that even with her suggested accommodation she could not fulfill the essential functions of her job. See Halpern, 669 F.3d at 465 ("[T]he indefinite duration and uncertain likelihood of success of Halpern's proposed accommodation renders it unreasonable."); see also Tyndall, 31 F.3d at 213 ("Plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that she could perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation.").
Moreover, Andrews' failure to keep UMRH up to date on her expected return-to-work date caused any break down in the interactive process between Andrews and UMRH. See Crabill, 423 F. App'x. at 323 ("[N]either party should be able to cause a breakdown in the process. . . . courts should look for signs of failure to participate . . . . [a] party that fails to communicate, [*22]  by way of initiation or response, may also be acting in bad faith. In essence, courts should attempt to isolate the cause of the breakdown and then assign responsibility."). On August 19, 2020, Everette sent Andrews a message requesting an update and stated, "I need at least for you to call every week and let me know how you are doing[.]" UMRH Statement ¶ 36. Andrews did not send weekly updates as to her medical condition or when she could return to work. Id. ¶ 38. Andrews's last call with Everette was in late August or early September. Andrews Dep. at 52. Andrews did not communicate with UMRH again for approximately a month. The court assigns responsibility for any breakdown in the interactive process to Andrews due to her lapse in communication.
UMRH is entitled to summary judgment on Andrews's failure-to-accommodate claim. Andrews request was, in fact, for indefinite leave. Her lack of communication caused any breakdown in the interactive process. Even if UMRH had granted Andrews's request for extra time, she cannot show the accommodation would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job at a definite point in the future. See Wilson, 717 F.3d at 346 ("The employee must show that had [*23]  [s]he been granted leave, at the point at which [s]he would have returned from leave, [s]he could have performed the essential functions of [her] job."); see also Myers, 50 F.3d at 283 ("[R]easonable accommodation does not require the County to wait indefinitely for Myers' medical conditions to be corrected, especially in light of the uncertainty of cure."). Andrews does not point to any evidence raising a genuine dispute of material fact to the contrary.

II. Wrongful Discharge

a. Legal Standards
The ADA prohibits discriminatory discharge. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). For a plaintiff to receive protection from the ADA, he or she must be a "qualified individual." Id. A "qualified individual" is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." Id. § 12111(8). The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating she is a qualified individual. Jessup, 23 F.4th at 365. If the plaintiff is a qualified individual, the plaintiff can prove a claim for discriminatory discharge by first establishing a prima facie case. A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case for discriminatory discharge if she demonstrates "(i) she was disabled, (ii) she was discharged, (iii) she [*24]  was fulfilling her employer's legitimate expectations when she was discharged, and (iv) the circumstances of her discharge raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination." Cowgill, 41 F.4th at 379; see also Haulbrook, 252 F.3d at 702. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, then the burden of production shifts to the defendant to produce a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge. Heiko v. Colombo Say. Bank, F.S.B., 434 F.3d 249, 258 (4th Cir. 2006); see also Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 575. Finally, the ultimate burden rests with the plaintiff to show the defendant's proffered reason is in fact a pretext and the discharge was caused by discrimination on the basis of the plaintiff's disability. Cowgill, 41 F.4th at 379-80; see also E.E.O.C. v. Town & Country Toyota, Inc., 7 F. App'x 226, 232 (4th Cir. 2001) ("Once the defendant satisfies its burden of production, the presumption created by the prima facie case drops out and the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of proving that he has been the victim of intentional discrimination.").

b. Analysis
Andrews' wrongful discharge claim fails because the undisputed material facts show she is not a qualified individual, see infra § I.b., and UMRH's decision to terminate her was not motivated by discriminatory animus. UMRH provided legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating Andrews and she cannot show pretext. Andrews presents no evidence raising any [*25]  genuine issue of material fact to contest any of these findings.
First, as explained above, Andrews could not perform her job's essential attendance requirement. Everette Aff. at 3, 4-6, ¶¶ 11, 21-22, 24-26, 28; Bryan Aff. at 3-4, ¶¶ 8, 11-12, 14; Lilley Aff. at 3-4, ¶¶ 10-11, 13-14. Accordingly, she was not a "qualified individual" under the ADA when UMRH terminated her employment. See Tyndall, 31 F.3d at 213 ("An employee who cannot meet the attendance requirements of the job at issue cannot be considered a 'qualified' individual protected by the ADA"); see also Bostick v. Cabarrus Cnty. Dept. of Health and Human Servs., No. 1:18-CV-1042, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94395, 2022 WL 1686903, at *6 (M.D.N.C. May 26, 2022) (ADA claim failed because plaintiff could not show that he was a "qualified individual" with a disability); McKinney v. Cleveland Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 3:20-cv-221-MOC-DSC, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94424, 2022 WL 1697395, at *2-3 (W.D.N.C. May 26, 2022) (ADA failure-to-accommodate claim failed because plaintiff could not establish that she was a "qualified individual" with a disability); Khan v. UNC Health Care Sys., No. 1:20-CV-977, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 182969, 2021 WL 4392012, at *6-7 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 24, 2021) (ADA claim failed because plaintiff did not allege sufficient facts that he was a "qualified individual" with a disability); Smith, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76259, 2015 WL 3675740, at *4-5 (plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" with a disability because his physicians had not provided a return-to-work release at the time of termination); Pittman v. Safelite Glass Corp., No. 4:12-CV-259-BO, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146243, 2014 WL 5170942, at *1 (E.D.N.C. Oct. 14, 2014) (ADA disability discrimination claim failed because plaintiff could not attend work regularly and could not establish that [*26]  he was a "qualified individual" with a disability); Lamb v. Qualex, Inc., 33 F. App'x 49, 56-57 (4th Cir. Apr. 3, 2002) ("A regular and reliable level of attendance is an essential function of one's job . . . . An employee who cannot meet the attendance requirements of the job at issue cannot be considered a 'qualified' individual protected by the ADA."). UMRH is entitled to summary judgment on Andrews's discriminatory discharge claim.
Second, even if Andrews were a qualified individual, UMRH provided legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for discharging Andrews. UMRH terminated Andrews because (1) she was unable to meet the attendance requirements of her job and was unable to report to work to perform her duties as a LPN Charge Nurse at Cypress Glen, (2) she had exhausted all of her PTO, (3) she had exhausted her FMLA leave, (4) she had not and could not provide UMRH with a specific return-to-work date, and (5) she had not and could not provide UMRH a release to return to work from her medical provider. Everette Aff. at 6, ¶ 28; Bryan Aff. at 4, ¶ 14; Lilley Aff. at 4, ¶ 14; Andrews Dep. at 23:24-24:7, 29:2-4, 31:8-13, 34:1-5, 45:3-10, 46:12-15, 48:20-23, 57:3-5. An employee's inability to attend work, even with a reasonable accommodation, is a legitimate, [*27]  non-discriminatory reason to terminate an employee. McNeil v. Scotland Cnty., 213 F. Supp. 2d 559, 568 (M.D.N.C.), aff'd, 53 F. App'x 242 (4th Cir. 2002) ("An employee's unavailability for work, where there is no legal obligation to maintain her employment, is a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for termination."); see also Carter v. Smithfield's of Morehead, Inc., No. 93-2034, 61 F.3d 899, 1995 WL 440415 at *3 (4th Cir. 1995) (unpublished) (unavailability for work was a legitimate reason not to hire). Moreover, "when an employer gives a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for discharging the plaintiff, 'it is not [this court's] province to decide whether the reason was wise, fair, or even correct, ultimately, so long as it truly was the reason for the plaintiff's termination.'" Hawkins v. PepsiCo, Inc., 203 F.3d 274, 279 (4th Cir. 2000). In short, UMRH provided unrebutted non-discriminatory justifications for terminating Andrews.
In response, Andrews points to no evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact that UMRH terminated her employment because of her disability or that UMRH's asserted reasons for terminating her were pretextual. She makes only conclusory assertions that discrimination motivated UMRH to terminate her. Indeed, because the record is "devoid of evidence that the decision to terminate plaintiff was motivated by an animus towards the disabled," summary judgment for the employer is appropriate. Ryan v. Columbus Reg'l Healthcare Sys. Inc., No. 7:10-CV-234-BR, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51466, 2012 WL 1230234, at *8 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 12, 2012). Moreover, [*28]  Andrews produced no evidence of pretext. She produced no evidence that any other UMRH employee took a similar leave of absence without providing a return-to-work date and was "nevertheless retained." See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 804, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); see also Walker v. Mod-U-Kraf Homes, LLC, 775 F.3d 202, 211 (4th Cir. 2014) ("To be sure, evidence that an employer treated similarly situated individuals differently can be evidence of pretext."); Laing v. Fed. Express Corp., 703 F.3d 713, 721 (4th Cir.2013) (stating that such comparator evidence "would be 'especially relevant' to a showing of pretext").2 Andrews also testified that Everette "seemed concerned for [her] well-being" when she was on leave, Andrews Dep. at 28:3-5, and she "liked working at Cypress Glen" and described her work environment as "an atmosphere of teamwork" and "a beautiful atmosphere," id. at 15:17-24, undercutting any claim of animus. See Fields v. Verizon Servs. Corp., 493 F. App'x 371, 377 (4th Cir. 2012) (plaintiff "undercuts her own [pretext] argument by offering significant evidence that [her employer] did not hold any discriminatory animus toward her . . . . testif[ying] that [he] was 'supportive' during her treatment and recovery . . . that she was 'always treated fairly' . . . and that [he] never did or said anything to her to suggest that [he] held [her] cancer or prolonged absence against her.").
In sum, UMRH is entitled to summary [*29]  judgment on Andrews's wrongful discharge claim because the undisputed material facts show she is not a qualified individual, she was terminated for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons, and she provides no evidence raising any genuine dispute of material fact that discrimination motivated UMRH to terminate her or that UMRH's reasons were pretextual. 3

III. Retaliation

a. Legal Standard
The ADA also prohibits a covered entity from retaliating against an individual for engaging in protected activity. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). "In order to prevail on a claim of retaliation, a plaintiff must either offer sufficient direct and indirect evidence of retaliation, or proceed under a burden-shifting method." Rhoads, 257 F.3d at 391. First, utilizing ordinary principles of proof, "the plaintiff must produce direct evidence of a stated purpose to discriminate and/or [indirect] evidence of sufficient probative force to reflect a genuine issue of material fact." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). "What is required is evidence of conduct or statements that both reflect directly the alleged discriminatory attitude and that bear directly on the contested employment decision." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, under the McDonnell-Douglas [*30]  burden-shifting method of proof, a plaintiff must show three prima facie elements: "(1) that [she] engaged in protected activity; (2) that [her] employer took an adverse action against [her]; and (3) that a causal connection existed between the adverse activity and the protected action." Haulbrook, 252 F.3d at 706. After stating a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to show that the plaintiff was fired for legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons. Rhoads, 257 F.3d at 392. Finally, the ultimate burden rests on the plaintiff to show those reasons are a pretext and she has been the victim of retaliation. Id.

b. Analysis
Assuming without deciding that she engaged in protected activity, Andrews has produced no evidence that UMRH terminated her employment because she engaged in protected activity. See Roberts v. Glenn Indus. Grp., Inc., 998 F.3d 111, 123 (4th Cir. 2021) ("[A] plaintiff must show that [her] employer 'took the adverse action because of the protected activity."). Andrews provides nothing more than her own opinion that she was terminated for retaliatory reasons. She makes only the conclusory statement that "[t]here was a causal relationship between [protected activity and her termination]; because Plaintiff requested reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff was terminated [*31]  by UMRH." DE 45 at 5, ¶ 7. This is insufficient to survive summary judgment. Andrews's "own opinion that the identified acts were retaliatory along with conclusory assertions to the same effect. . . . are insufficient to create a disputed question of material fact." Burrs v. Walter Kidde Portable Equip., Inc., No. 1:16-CV-1149, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53851, 2018 WL 1626120, at *4 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 30, 2018). She has produced no evidence that UMRH terminated her because she engaged in protected activity. Reynolds, 701 F.3d at 154 (holding a retaliation claim failed when the plaintiff did "not proffer[ ] any . . . citation to the record demonstrating that there is 'evidence' of a link between the protected activity and his termination."); Mackey v. Shalala, 360 F.3d 463, 469-70 (4th Cir. 2004) ("A plaintiff's own self-serving opinions, absent anything more, are insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination."); see also Pascual v. Lowe's Home Ctrs., Inc., 193 F. App'x 229, 233 (4th Cir. 2006) (same).
In addition, for the reasons stated in the preceding section, UMRH has produced legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for Andrews termination and she produced no evidence of pretext. Therefore, UMRH is entitled to summary judgment on Andrews's retaliation claim.4

IV. Conclusion
The court concludes there is no dispute of material fact and UMRH is entitled to summary judgment on all claims. UMRH's motion is GRANTED.
SO ORDERED [*32]  this 22nd day of November, 2022.
