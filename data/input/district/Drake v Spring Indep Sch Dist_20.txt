ORDER ON MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Pending before the court is Defendant Spring Independent School District (Spring ISD)'s Motion for Summary Judgment. (D.E. 24.) The Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.

1. Background and Procedural Posture
Plaintiff Tracy Drake worked for Spring ISD from 2008 to 2015. She alleges that Spring ISD terminated her employment because she suffers from ulcerative colitis. Drake filed a discrimination charge with the Texas Workforce Commission Civil Rights Division (TWCCRD) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). (D.E. 24-36.) Drake sued Spring ISD under the Americans with Disability Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-13, 12203, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), Pub.L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008). Drake alleges disability discrimination and retaliation. Spring ISD moves for summary judgment.
Drake has a master's degree in education and a bachelor's degree in business management. (D.E. 24-10 at 121:24-9.) Drake is certified as a teacher and a principal. (D.E. 24-10 at 122:22-23.) She has twenty-one years [*2]  of experience and has worked as a summer school principal. (D.E. 24-10 at 101:14-27, 123:2-4.) She also worked as a Career and Technical Education (CTE) teacher at Dueitt Middle School (Dueitt) beginning in the 2008-09 school year and ending in the 2013-14 school year. (D.E. 24-1 at ¶ 3.)
In 2013, Spring ISD hired Drake to fill the Registrar position at Dueitt for the 2013-14 school year. (D.E. 24-2; D.E. 24-10, Drake Dep. 13:18-22.) Just before Drake applied, Spring ISD reclassified the Registrar position from paraprofessional to professional. (D.E. 24-10 at 13:6-12.) According to Drake, the job description contained only the duties of the Registrar position and of no other. Id. at 14:22-15:6. After Drake began to work as the Registrar, Spring ISD required Drake to perform the additional duties of an Attendance Clerk. Id. at 14:22-15:10.
In 2014, after Drake's first year as the Registrar at Dueitt, her supervisors gave her an unsatisfactory performance review. (D.E. 24-11 at 5; D.E. 24-10 at 71:8-22.) Drake filed an internal grievance complaint, alleging that "the unreasonable amount of additional duties that she was required to perform on top of her registrar duties and the lack of [*3]  support from her administration prevented her from performing her registrar duties." (D.E. 24-11 at 6.) Drake also complained that the assistant principal at Dueitt treated her in an unprofessional manner. Id. The complaints never mentioned Drake's physical health, and Drake admitted at her deposition that her complaints were unrelated to her disability. (D.E. 24-10 at 112:24-113:14.) In July of 2014, Drake and Spring ISD entered a settlement agreement and resolved all claims related to her internal grievance. (D.E. 24-5.)
In April of 2015, Drake's ulcerative colitis worsened, and she was hospitalized. (D.E. 24-10 at 19:15-20:8.) Drake requested leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). (D.E. 24-12 at 1.) Spring ISD granted Drake one month of FMLA leave starting on April 27, 2015, and ending on May 26, 2015. (D.E. 27-3.) In a note dated May 22, 2015, Drake's doctor opined that Drake needed at least one more month off work. (D.E. 27-6.) On June 2, 2015, the doctor wrote another note recommending that Drake be off work for another three months, subject to reevaluation on July 28, 2015. (D.E. 27-7.)
In a letter, Spring ISD granted Drake ninety days of temporary medical leave [*4]  from April 27, 2015, to July 26, 2015. (D.E. 27-8.) The letter notified Drake of the district's policy governing temporary medical leave, which included that "[i]f the staff member has not been released by his/her physician by the end of the leave, the staff member can either resign or be terminated from their position." Id.
On July 13, 2015, Spring ISD asked Drake to provide a return-to-work date prior to the expiration of her temporary medical leave. (D.E. 27-9.) On July 27, 2015, Drake asked Spring ISD to provide her with forms that she could use to request more leave. (D.E. 27-10.) She did not provide a definite return-to-work date. Id. Instead, Drake gave Spring ISD a note from her doctor dated July 27, 2015, which stated that Drake would need to be off work for at least another week. (D.E. 27-11.) Drake sent Spring ISD another note from her doctor, dated July 29, 2015, which stated that Drake had been admitted to the hospital for a week and that she would "be reevaluated to determine her ability to return to normal routine." (D.E. 27-13.) The second note did not provide a return-to-work date. Id. On July 31, 2015, Drake e-mailed Spring ISD, stating that her doctor told her that [*5]  she could "possibly" return to work on August 10, 2015, depending on the test results. (D.E. 27-12.) Drake testified at deposition that she could not return to work on August 10, 2015. (D.E. 24-10 at 65:21-24.) Spring ISD notified Drake that because Drake's allowed leave had expired, her position was no longer protected. (D.E. 27-12.) On August 5, 2015, Drake e-mailed Spring ISD and requested temporary disability leave, without specifying when she could return to work. (D.E. 27-14.)
On August 10, 2015, Spring ISD notified Drake her employment was terminated, effective August 7, 2015, because she had exhausted her allowed leave. (D.E. 27-15.) Drake's doctor provided another note on August 10, 2015, offering no return-to-work date. (D.E. 27-16.) The note stated that Drake would be reevaluated in four weeks. Id.
On August 21, 2015, Drake filed a level one grievance to appeal her termination. (D.E. 27-17.) Drake alleged that Spring ISD did not offer reasonable accommodations for her disability and that Spring ISD retaliated against her for filing a grievance in the 2013-14 school year. Id.
Drake filed a charge of discrimination with the TWCCRD and the EEOC on September 3, 2015. (D.E. 24-36.) [*6]  Drake's discrimination charge alleged that Spring ISD violated the ADA by not offering her temporary disability leave and that Spring ISD should have engaged with her in the interactive process to design and offer her a reasonable accommodation. Id. She also alleged that Spring ISD's actions were done in retaliation for the grievance Drake filed in the 2013-14 school year. Id.
On September 22, 2015, Drake's doctor wrote in a note that Drake could return to work on October 26, 2015, with the following restrictions:
The first week upon returning to work should be limited to part time 4 hours per day, Second week limited to 6 hours per day, Third week she may begin a regular work schedule at 8 hours a day. However every 8 weeks Mrs. Drake must return to the hospital for her 2 hour treatments for her current condition.
(D.E. 27-18 at 2.)
On October 30, 2015, Spring ISD offered to settle Drake's level one grievance. (D.E. 24-30 at 2-4.) Spring ISD's offer included:
• rescinding the August 7, 2015 termination;
• providing accommodation of unpaid leave from July 27, 2015, through October 31, 2015; and
• waiving the policy requirement to terminate Drake's employment and rehiring her in a position [*7]  comparable to the Registrar position.
(D.E. 24-30 at 2.) Spring ISD suggested that the Attendance Clerk position was comparable to the Registrar position.
Drake's attorney declined the offer, stating that "Ms. Drake is not interested in any of the positions listed. She has a master's degree and is not willing to accept a paraprofessional position. She also has decided not to resign." (D.E. 24-30 at 1.)
On November 3, 2015, Spring ISD issued a level one grievance response, which mirrored the district's previous settlement offer. (D.E. 27-20.) The district granted Drake retroactive unpaid leave from July 28, 2015, through November 6, 2015, and offered to rehire Drake in an open position comparable to her previous role. Id. at SISD-0283. Noting that no Registrar or teaching positions were available, Spring ISD stated it would hire Drake as an Attendance Clerk, which Spring ISD again asserted was comparable to the Registrar position. Id. Spring ISD required Drake to report to work on November 9, 2015, and notified Drake that it would deem her failure to report to work as a resignation. Id. at SISD-0283-84. Drake did not report to work on November 9, 2015. (D.E. 24-10 at 89:20-21.) Spring [*8]  ISD deemed Drake as having resigned. (D.E. 24-37 at ¶ 7.)
Drake filed a level two grievance on November 16, 2015. (D.E. 24-32.) Spring ISD offered Drake a list of more than fifty positions for which Drake was qualified. (D.E. 27-21 at SISD-0295.) Drake expressed her interest in two positions for which, according to the district, she was not qualified: Behavioral Specialist and Compliance Director. (D.E. 24-1 at ¶ 8; D.E. 24-10 at 96:4-7; D.E. 24-34.) Drake considered those two positions to be comparable to her prior role as the Registrar of Dueitt. (D.E. 24-10 at 96:8-97:2.)
Spring ISD issued a level two grievance decision, which stated that the district granted Drake's request to be placed in a position comparable to the Registrar position, but that Drake resigned by not reporting to work as an Attendance Clerk on November 9, 2015. (D.E. 27-21 at SISD-0294.) The letter also stated that the district offered Drake fifty positions that it deemed comparable to the Registrar positions, but Drake did not choose one. Id. at SISD-0295. The district granted Drake's request to reinstate her health insurance coverage through November 2015, under the condition that Drake pay monthly premiums for [*9]  the period that she was on unpaid leave. Id. at SISD-0296.
By January of 2016, Drake was employed in the Aldine Independent School District. (D.E. 24-10 at 144:7-11.) Drake filed a level three grievance complaint against Spring ISD on February 2, 2016. (D.E. 24-7.) Around that time, Spring ISD and Drake discussed a teaching role in the CTE department, but Drake refused the position. (D.E. 24-10 at 106:3-7; D.E. 24-35.) The Board of Trustees of Spring ISD held a hearing on September 13, 2016, in which Drake participated. (D.E. 24-9.) By unanimous vote, the Board affirmed Spring ISD's level three grievance decision. (D.E. 24-9 at SISD-0412-0413.)
Drake brought the present lawsuit, raising claims of disability discrimination and retaliation under the ADA. Spring ISD moves for summary judgment. (D.E. 24.) Drake filed a response (D.E. 27), and Spring ISD filed a reply. (D.E. 28.) As summary judgment evidence, Drake submitted her declaration (D.E. 27-2) and relied on the summary judgment evidence submitted by Spring ISD. Spring ISD filed objections to Drake's declaration. (D.E. 29.)

2. Analysis

A. Motion to exclude
Spring ISD moves to strike Drake's declaration (D.E. 27-2) because it contains [*10]  conclusory allegations and does not satisfy the statutory requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1746. Legal conclusions and unsubstantiated assertions not supported by the facts of the affidavit are not competent summary judgment evidence. Galindo v. Precision Am. Corp., 754 F.2d 1212, 1216 (5th Cir. 1985); Turner, 476 F.3d at 343. The court finds that the following allegations in Drake's declaration are legal conclusions or conclusory assertions that will not be considered as summary judgment evidence:
13. I engaged in protected activity by taking medical leave and providing written and verbal requests for accommodations from my physician to Defendant.
15. Defendant wholly failed to engage in the good faith interactive accommodation process with me regarding my disability, perceived disability or record of disability.
19. Defendant discriminated and retaliated against me for engaging in protected activity and because of my disability, report of disability or perceived disability. Defendant wholly failed to engage in the good faith interactive process regarding my requests for accommodations. Defendant violated the Americans with Disability Act, including Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), as amended.
20. Defendant wholly failed to offer any reasonable explanation why they refused to accommodate me or engage in the good faith interactive process.
21. Defendant cannot [*11]  establish and/or justify a business reason why they could not accommodate me in my current position of Registrar . . . .
22. Since the initial request on May 2015, Defendant intentionally ignored ongoing requests for accommodations via email and by phone. My request did not pose an undue hardship . . . .
(D.E. 27-2.) Spring ISD's motion is granted on these allegations.
Spring ISD also argues that Drake's declaration is not competent summary judgment evidence because it does not comply with the statutory requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1746. A party seeking to use a declaration as evidence must sign and date it under penalty of perjury. 28 U.S.C. § 1746; Smiley v. San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist., No. SA-09-CA-29-FB, 2010 WL 11506654, at *5 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 1, 2010). Drake's declaration was not signed under penalty of perjury. (D.E. 27-2.) The court may consider an unsworn declaration, however, "on the assumption that, at the least, they are facts plaintiff alleges and would prove if [she] could." McKinney v. Ponder, No. 2:03CV0385, 2005 WL 544332, at *9 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 4, 2005), report and recommendation adopted sub nom. McKinney v. Johnson, No. 2:03-CV-0385, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4963, 2005 WL 724480 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 28, 2005). The court does so here.

B. Motion for summary judgment

(1) Summary judgment legal standard
"Summary judgment is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, 'the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant [*12]  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'" Davenport v. Edward D. Jones & Co., 891 F.3d 162, 167 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). A factual dispute is material if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law," and it is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
"The movant bears the burden of identifying those portions of the record it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Lincoln General Ins. Co. v. Reyna, 401 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir. 2005) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-25, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). If this burden is met, the nonmovant must then "set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248. The nonmovant must "go beyond the pleadings," using competent summary judgment evidence and cite to "specific facts" showing a genuine issue for trial. Bustos v. Martini Club, Inc., 599 F.3d 458, 468 (5th Cir. 2010). Conclusory allegations and unsubstantiated assertions are not enough to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment. Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., 476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir. 2007).
The court reviews all evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Lincoln General, 401 F.3d at 350. The nonmovant must "articulate the precise manner in which the submitted or identified evidence supports his or her claim." CQ, Inc. v. TXU Mining Co., 565 F.3d 268, 273 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Smith ex. rel. Estate of Smith v. United States, 39 F.3d 621, 625 (5th Cir. 2004)). The court is not required to search the entire record to ensure that the record is "bereft of genuine issue of [*13]  material fact." Topalian v. Ehrman, 954 F.2d 1125, 1137 n.30 (5th Cir. 1992).
Demonstrating a "mere scintilla of evidence" is not enough; "there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252. "A party's uncorroborated self-serving testimony cannot prevent summary judgment, particularly if the overwhelming documentary evidence supports the opposite scenario." Vinewood Capital, LLC v. Dar Al-Maal Al-Islami Trust, 541 F. App'x 443, 447 (5th Cir. 2013).

(2) Exhaustion under the ADA
A plaintiff bringing claims under the ADA "must comply with the ADA's administrative prerequisites prior to commencing an action in federal court against her employer for violation of the ADA." Dao v. Auchan Hypermarket, 96 F.3d 787, 789 (5th Cir. 1996). "The exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional, and a '[f]ailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense that should be pleaded.'" Matson v. Sanderson Farms, Inc., 388 F. Supp. 3d 853, 877 (S.D. Tex. 2019) (collecting cases). "Failure to exhaust is grounds for dismissal." Williams v. Tarrant Cty. Coll. Dist., 717 F. App'x 440, 445 (5th Cir. 2018), reh'g denied (Feb. 20, 2018).
The ADA incorporates by reference the exhaustion procedures applicable to Title VII actions, which require a plaintiff to "file a timely charge with the EEOC, or with a state or local agency with authority to grant or seek relief from the alleged unlawful employment practice" before bringing suit in federal court. Dao, 96 F.3d at 789; see 42 U.S.C. §§ 12117(a) (incorporating Title VII by reference), § 2000e-5(e)(1) (Title VII exhaustion procedure). Where, as here, [*14]  the plaintiff institutes proceedings with a State or local agency, the plaintiff must file the charge within three hundred days of the alleged discriminatory act. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1); Dao, 96 F.3d at 789; Ramirez v. City of San Antonio, 312 F.3d 178, 181 (5th Cir. 2002).
After the administrative exhaustion requirement is met, the lawsuit "'can include only those allegations that are like or related to those allegations contained in the EEOC charge and growing out of such allegations during the pendency of the case before the [administrative agency].'" Matson, 388 F. Supp. 3d at 877 (quoting Davenport, 891 F.3d at 167).
Drake's charge of discrimination filed with the EEOC and the TWCCRD alleged:
Ms. Pamela David, Director of Medical Leaves stated that I had exhausted my sick leave and did not qualify for temporary disability or reasonable accommodations as I requested numerous times prior to the FMLA of 12 weeks ended. I repeatedly asked Ms. David and Ms. David's assistant, Ms. Dorado, about the necessary paperwork for temporary disability and accommodations as I suffered a relapse due to my disability. I was not afforded the right to reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition, Ms. David did not explain early on that I did not qualify. She just stated my options were to get terminated or resign. She made it clear no other options were [*15]  available. Respondent failed to engage me in the interactive process and to provide the available reasonable accommodation which I was requesting. I also believe this is in retaliation for my prior complaint against Respondent. In addition, Respondent breached the terms of our agreement with regards to my disability.
I believe that I was retaliated against for engaging in a protected activity and discriminated against because of my Disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), as amended; and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.
(D.E. 24-36.)
Based on a liberal construction of Drake's discrimination charge, just three claims raised in this lawsuit are like, related to, or grow out of the allegations in the EEOC charge: (1) Spring ISD discriminated against Drake by declining to grant additional leave when she was hospitalized and could not return to work as Registrar; (2) Spring ISD discriminated against Drake during the 2015-16 grievance proceedings by not rehiring her in the position she wanted; and (3) Spring ISD retaliated against Drake for engaging in an activity protected under the ADA. Any other claims are unexhausted.

(3) Discrimination and reasonable accommodation under the ADA
The ADA makes it illegal to discriminate [*16]  against an individual because of her disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to . . . discharge of employees . . . and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." Id. "[N]ot making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability" is a form of discrimination prohibited under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
The plaintiff bears the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. Delaval v. PTech Drilling Tubulars, L.L.C., 824 F.3d 476, 479 (5th Cir. 2016) (applying the framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)). To state a prima facie case of disability discrimination, the plaintiff must show that she (1) has a disability; (2) was qualified for the job; and (3) was subject to an adverse employment decision on account of her disability. Id. "Title VII . . . provide[s] guidance as to the elements which constitute a prima facie case of disability discrimination." Aikens v. Banana Republic, Inc., 877 F. Supp. 1031, 1036 (S.D. Tex. 1995). A failure to establish a prima facie case of discrimination results in dismissal of the claim on summary judgment. See Holtzclaw v. DSC Commc'ns Corp., 255 F.3d 254, 259 (5th Cir. 2001) ("Because [the plaintiff] cannot establish that element of his prima [*17]  facie claim, summary judgment was appropriate on the ADA claim.").
For summary judgment purposes, the court assumes without deciding that Drake was disabled from her ulcerative colitis.
The court construes Drake's arguments to be that Spring ISD engaged in adverse actions when it (1) imposed an excessive workload by requiring her to perform the duties of both the Registrar and the Attendance Clerk, (2) terminated her employment on August 7, 2015, instead of granting her additional leave, and (3) did not allow her to resume work as a registrar upon the rescission of her termination. For the following reasons, none of the alleged adverse action provides a basis for Drake's disability discrimination or accommodation claims.

(a) Spring ISD's imposition of additional duties during Drake's employment as Registrar
As an initial matter, Drake's EEOC charge only complains about her termination in August 2015. Any allegation in the present lawsuit about events preceding the termination could have been raised in Drake's EEOC charge but was not. Her allegation that Spring ISD refused to reduce her duties as an accommodation is not raised in her EEOC complaint. Thus, Drake's first theory of adverse [*18]  action is unexhausted and not properly before the court. Summary judgment is warranted for this reason alone.
Exhaustion aside, Spring ISD's imposition of additional workload does not constitute an adverse action. See Ellis v. Compass Grp. USA, Inc., 426 F. App'x 292, 296 (5th Cir. 2011) ("Imposing a higher workload than that given to other employees is not an adverse employment action."). "[A]n employee's allegation that her employer caused her injury is irrelevant to the question of whether she has suffered discrimination under the ADA." Allen v. Babcock & Wilcox Tech. Servs. Pantex, LLC, No. 2:12-CV-00225-J, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146251, 2013 WL 5570192, at *6 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 9, 2013) (citing Trotter v. B & S Aircraft Parts & Accessories, Inc., No. 94-1404-FGT, 1996 WL 473837, at *9 (D. Kan. Aug. 13, 1996), for the position that "such an allegation must resound in tort or under a state worker's compensation statute").
Drake seems to imply that the extra duties led to her ultimate termination. An employee may establish that an employer constructively discharged her by imposing unendurable working conditions. See Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 141, 124 S. Ct. 2342, 159 L. Ed. 2d 204 (2004) ("Under the constructive discharge doctrine, an employee's reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes."). But Drake did not raise constructive discharge as a theory in her discrimination charge, complaint, or her responsive pleading.
Even were the court to reach the merits of the constructive discharge theory of adverse [*19]  action, Drake cannot establish its elements. The elements of constructive discharge are, first, that the plaintiff "was discriminated against by his employer to the point where a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign," and second, that she "actually resigned." Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 136 S. Ct. 1769, 1777, 195 L. Ed. 2d 44 (2016); Haley v. All. Compressor LLC, 391 F.3d 644, 650 (5th Cir. 2004). The employee must show more than mere discrimination; she must show that the employer fostered a work environment "so intolerable that a reasonable employee would feel compelled to resign." See Brown v. Kinney Shoe Corp., 237 F.3d 556, 566 (5th Cir. 2001). A non-discriminatory reorganization of business may not support a claim of constructive discharge. E.g., Jurgens v. E.E.O.C., 903 F.2d 386, 392 (5th Cir. 1990).
Here, Drake did not resign after more work was imposed on her. She was fired on August 7, 2015, because she was not able to report to work after she exhausted her medical leave. Spring ISD later withdrew the decision and offered Drake to return to work. Drake's later resignation on November 13, 2015, is too far removed from Spring ISD's imposition of additional duties to constitute constructive discharge.
Moreover, Drake has offered no evidence to show that the imposition of additional duties was in any way connected to her disability. Drake admitted at deposition that the only internal grievance [*20]  she filed about the allegedly excessive workload "was just about the work," and not related to her disability. (D.E. 24-10 at 112:24-113:14.) The court's own review of the record confirms that Drake's internal grievance filings during the 2013-14 school year did not allege that Spring ISD's actions were in any way related to her disability. (D.E. 24-11.)
Finally, to the extent that Drake alleges Spring ISD failed to afford her reasonable accommodation regarding her workload as the Registrar, her claim lacks merit. "An employee who needs an accommodation . . . has the responsibility of informing [his] employer." Delaval, 824 F.3d at 481 (internal quotation marks omitted). The record contains no evidence that Drake informed Spring ISD of her ulcerative colitis any time before she requested medical leave in 2015. Drake's declaration alleges she complained to the district that the excessive workload was affecting her ulcerative colitis and asked for a reduction in duties. (D.E. 27-2 at ¶ 6.) Drake testified to the contrary during her deposition, when she admitted that the only complaint she filed about her workload "was just about the work" and not about her disability. (D.E. 24-10 at 112:24-113:14.) The court's [*21]  review of the internal complaint form shows it did not discuss Drake's health; she complained only that the excessive workload led her to receive a negative performance review. (D.E. 24-11.) Other than her own self-serving, conclusory declaration, Drake offers no evidence showing that she put Spring ISD on notice that the increase in her workload exacerbated her ulcerative colitis. Drake's declaration is not enough to defeat summary judgment because a self-serving, conclusory declaration, on its own, cannot create a genuine issue of material fact. See Vinewood Capital, LLC, 541 F. App'x at 447. This is particularly true when all the other facts in the case, including the Plaintiff's own deposition testimony is to the contrary.
Drake's disability discrimination claim regarding her workload as a Registrar is unexhausted or, in the alternative, meritless. Summary judgment on this claim is granted.

(b) Drake's termination on August 7, 2015
Assuming the initial termination of employment on August 7, 2015, is an adverse employment action,1 Drake cannot show that she was a qualified individual at the time she was discharged from her position as the Registrar. To establish that Drake was a qualified individual, she must show that she [*22]  could perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodations, at the time the adverse action took place. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m); Moss v. Harris Cty. Constable Precinct One, 851 F.3d 413, 417-18 (5th Cir. 2017) ("We do not question whether [the plaintiff] was qualified for his job prior to taking leave, instead the question is whether he was qualified at the time of his termination.").
Drake cannot show that she was qualified to return to work on August 7, 2015. She did not know when she could return to work at any point between May 13, 2015, when Drake first requested medical leave, and August 7, 2015, when she was discharged from her employment. (D.E. 24-10 at 31:25-32:4; D.E. 27-4; D.E. 27-6.) On July 29, 2015, Drake's doctor could not determine when Drake could return to work. (D.E. 27-13.) Drake later admitted that she was not certain when she could return to work, although her goal was to return on August 10, 2015. (D.E. 24-10 at 51:1-7.) On August 10, 2015, Drake's medical condition did not allow her to return to work. (D.E. 24-10 at 65:21-24.) It was more than a month after Drake's employment with Spring ISD had ended that Drake's doctor cleared Drake to return to work on October 26, 2015. (D.E. 27-18 at 2.)
Because Drake cannot show she was a qualified [*23]  individual at the time the adverse action took place, Drake cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on her termination of employment on August 7, 2015.
To the extent that Drake argues Spring ISD failed to afford her reasonable accommodation by not granting her additional leave, her claim is meritless. An accommodation is reasonable only if it would not impose an undue hardship on the employer's operations. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, 174 F.3d 615, 619 (5th Cir. 1999). "Time off, whether paid or unpaid, can be a reasonable accommodation, but an employer is not required to provide a disabled employee with indefinite leave." Delaval, 824 F.3d at 481; see Moss, 851 F.3d at 419.
Drake was not able to provide Spring ISD with a definite date that she could return to work before September 23, 2015, when her doctor provided a note stating that she would be medically cleared to work by the end of October. At the time Drake requested for more leave on July 27, 2015, she could not provide Spring ISD with a return-to-work date. (D.E. 27-10 at 3.) Drake later admitted at deposition that, when Spring ISD terminated her employment, her doctor had not released her to return to work. (D.E. 24-10 at 53:8-10, 65:21-24.) In other words, she was not capable of performing any [*24]  work. Requiring Spring ISD to continue to extend the leave, with no certainty of when Drake could return to work, would be to impose an undue burden on Spring ISD. No interactive process would have allowed Spring ISD to fashion a reasonable accommodation.
The fact that Spring ISD later, during the grievance process, granted further unpaid leave does not change the analysis. The question is whether, on August 7, 2015, a reasonable accommodation existed. On that date, Drake was out of leave and could not provide a return date, so no accommodation existed.
Drake was not a qualified individual at the time Spring ISD terminated her employment on August 7, 2015. For that reason, Drake cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on her initial discharge. Her request for more leave was not reasonable. The court therefore denies Drake's claims based on Spring ISD's denial of additional leave and the ensuing termination of her employment.

(c) Spring ISD's actions during the 2015-16 internal grievance proceedings
In response to the summary judgment motion, Drake challenges Spring ISD's actions during the 2015-16 grievance proceedings for the first time. After Drake filed [*25]  a level one internal grievance, Spring ISD offered to rehire Drake as an Attendance Clerk, which it deemed comparable to the Registrar position. Later, during the grievance process, Spring ISD also provided Drake with fifty positions that the district deemed to be comparable to the Registrar position.2 (D.E. 27-21 at SISD-0295.) Drake declined the Attendance Clerk position, and she did not report to work on the date specified by Spring ISD. (D.E. 24-10 at 89:20-21.) She did not accept any of the fifty positions that Spring ISD offered to her. (D.E. 27-21 at SISD-0295.) By January of 2016, Drake was already employed in another school district. (D.E. 24-10 at 144:7-11.) Drake asked Spring ISD to hire her as a Compliance Director or Behavior Specialist. Spring ISD determined that she was not qualified for either position. Drake later admitted that the only qualifying experiences she had for those two positions were observational training and her experience as an intern. (D.E. 24-10 at 97-103.) When Spring ISD declined her request, Drake appealed the grievance decision, and the Board of Trustees of the Spring ISD ultimately denied her appeal at level three. (D.E. 24-9 at SISD-0412-SISD-0413.) [*26] 
Drake has not shown that Spring ISD's actions were adverse actions taken on account of her disability. Drake does not show what position was available and comparable to the Registrar position but not offered to her. Spring ISD applied objective criteria and district policy to deny Drake the jobs for which she lacked experience. There is no evidence that the denial was based on her disability. If the fact that Spring ISD offered Drake employment is evidence of anything, it indicates a lack of discriminatory intent.
To the extent that Drake raises a reasonable accommodation claim as to Spring ISD's actions during the grievance proceeding, the court finds that Spring ISD more than satisfied the obligations it owed Drake, if it owed her any. Although Drake sought to be reinstated as the Registrar, Spring ISD had already filled the position by the time Drake was medically cleared to return to work. (D.E. 24-1 at ¶ 7.) The ADA does not require the employer to reassign existing employees. Robertson v. Neuromedical Ctr., 161 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir. 1998). Spring ISD not only offered to rehire Drake in any one of fifty other positions it deemed to be comparable, but it also retroactively granted her sick leave and insurance benefits. (D.E. 27-21 at 3-4.) Drake [*27]  does not identify what further accommodation Spring ISD could have offered her that she would have accepted. The record shows that it was Drake, who had already started working for a neighboring school district, that declined the accommodations Spring ISD afforded to her. Spring ISD did not violate the ADA.
Drake cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on Spring ISD's actions during the grievance proceeding. Spring ISD afforded Drake with reasonable accommodations. Summary judgment is granted as to Drake's claims based on events during the 2015-16 grievance process.

(4) Retaliation under the ADA
The ADA makes it illegal for an employer to retaliate against an employee for engaging in a protected activity. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112(a), 12203. Drake's discrimination charge and complaint raise allegations that she was fired in retaliation for her participation in an activity protected under the ADA.
Under the McDonnell-Douglas burden shifting framework, the plaintiff bears the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of ADA retaliation. Sherrod v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 132 F.3d 1112, 1122 (5th Cir. 1998). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, the plaintiff must show: (1) she was engaged in an activity protected under the ADA; (2) [*28]  the employer subjected her to an adverse action; and (3) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action existed. Porter v. Houma Terrebonne Hous. Auth. Bd. of Comm'rs, 810 F.3d 940, 945 (5th Cir. 2015). A prima facie case for retaliation under the ADA also requires the plaintiff to show that she was a qualified individual at the time the employer took the adverse action. Moss, 851 F.3d at 420. Summary judgment is appropriate where the plaintiff cannot carry the burden to establish a prima facie case of ADA retaliation. See Tabatchnik v. Cont'l Airlines, 262 F. App'x 674, 677 (5th Cir. 2008); Smith v. United Parcel Serv., 50 F. Supp. 2d 649, 653 (S.D. Tex. 1999).
Spring ISD argues that because Drake's participation in the internal grievance process during the 2013-14 school year took place outside the three-hundred-day cutoff for filing an EEOC charge, Drake's retaliation claim is unexhausted. (D.E. 28 at 12.) Spring ISD argues, in the alternative, that Drake cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA.
As an initial matter, Drake's response to Spring ISD's summary judgment motion does not even mention her retaliation claim. In the Southern District of Texas, a failure to timely respond is taken as a representation of no opposition. S.D. Tex. L.R. 7.4. However, a "motion for summary judgment cannot be granted simply because there is no opposition, even if failure to oppose violated a local [*29]  rule." Hetzel v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 50 F.3d 360, 362 n.3 (5th Cir. 1995). Instead, the court may accept the unopposed facts set forth in the summary judgment motion as undisputed. C.f. Eversley v. MBank Dallas, 843 F.2d 172, 174 (5th Cir. 1988) (affirming the district court's acceptance of the facts in support of the defendant's summary judgment motion as undisputed, where the plaintiff made no opposition to the motion).
Drake's grievance during the 2013-14 school year was a complaint about workload and workplace conditions. It had nothing to do with her disability. See supra Part 2.B.(3)(a). It was therefore not a protected activity under the ADA. See St. John v. NCI Bldg. Sys., Inc., 537 F. Supp. 2d 848, 864 (S.D. Tex.) (holding that the employee's emails were not protected activity because they were not related to the employee's disability); see also Grant v. Harris Cty., 794 F. App'x 352, 361 (5th Cir. 2019) (finding that the employee's complaints about matters outside the scope of the ADA did not constitute an activity protected under the ADA).
Assuming Drake's request for additional leave in July—August of 2015 constitutes a protected activity under the ADA, Drake cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation because she was not a qualified individual on August 7, 2015, when Spring ISD terminated her employment as Registrar. See Moss, 851 F.3d at 418 (holding that the plaintiff has the burden to show that she was a qualified individual at the time [*30]  the employer took an adverse action). Drake's medical conditions at that time did not allow her to return to Spring ISD or perform any work. See supra Part 2.B.(3).(b). Thus, Drake was not a qualified individual.
To the extent that Drake alleges Spring ISD retaliated against her during the 2015-16 grievance proceedings, her claim lacks merit. As discussed above, it was Drake, not Spring ISD, who did not accept the district's offer to rehire her during the 2015-16 grievance negotiations. See supra Part 2.B.(3).(c). There is no evidence that Spring ISD's reconciliatory gestures constituted an adverse action. Spring ISD continued to offer Drake employment despite her disability. It is difficult to see how its actions could be considered retaliation on account of her disability. Therefore, Drake cannot establish that Spring ISD engaged in retaliatory actions during the 2015-16 grievance proceedings.
Drake has not established a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA. Summary judgment is granted as to Drake's retaliation claims.

3. Conclusion
Spring ISD's Motion for Summary Judgment (D.E. 24) is GRANTED. All other pending motions are terminated. The court will issue a separate final judgment.
