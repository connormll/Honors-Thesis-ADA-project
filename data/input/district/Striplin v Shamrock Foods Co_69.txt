Opinion


CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings: Order (1) GRANTING Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 26); and (2) VACATING the March 28, 2016 Hearing (IN CHAMBERS)
Before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. No. 26.) The Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution without a hearing pursuant to Local Rule 7-15. After considering all papers timely filed in support of and in opposition to Defendant's Motion, the Court GRANTS the Motion and VACATES the March 28, 2016 hearing.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff filed his Complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside, on March 13, 2015. ("Complaint," Doc. No. 1-1.) Plaintiff alleges he was employed by Defendant Shamrock Foods Company, Inc. ("Defendant" or "Shamrock") from March 18, 2008 until March 22, 2013. (Complaint [*2]  ¶ 62.) Plaintiff contends he was discharged because he complained that his employee identification number was being used improperly and without his permission to assist Defendant in violating a court-ordered injunction. (Id. ¶ 67.) Plaintiff also contends that Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff based upon his alleged disability of workplace-related stress (id. ¶ 98), and discharged Plaintiff because he desired to request leave under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") to recover from workplace-related stress, (id. ¶ 63). Finally, Plaintiff contends that Defendant denied him all payments due upon termination and failed to provide accurate wage statements. (Id. ¶¶ 126, 131-32, 137.)
Plaintiff's Complaint asserts eleven claims for relief: (1) wrongful termination under the FMLA and the California Family Rights Act, California Government Code § 12945.2(f) ("CFRA"); (2) retaliation for exercising his rights under the FMLA; (3) retaliation for exercising his rights under the CFRA; (4) retaliation under section 1102.5 of the California Labor Code for refusing to participate in Defendant's business activities that would have resulted in violation of a court order; (5) disability discrimination in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); [*3]  (6) failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of the FEHA; (7) failure to accommodate Plaintiff's disability in violation of the FEHA; (8) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (9) compensation for all time worked, including January 1, 2013, for which Plaintiff contends he was not compensated in violation of section 201 of the California Labor Code; (10) making unauthorized wage deductions in violation of section 224 of the California Labor Code; and (11) failure to provide accurate wage statements in violation of section 226 of the California Labor Code. (See generally id)
On April 7, 2015, Defendant removed the action to this Court. (Not. of Removal, Doc. No. 1.)
On January 30, 2016, Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. ("Motion," Doc. No. 26.) Defendant filed the following documents in support of its Motion:
• Memorandum of Points and Authorities ("Def.'s Mem," Doc. No. 26-1);
• Declaration of Monica Hergert ("Hergert Decl," Doc. No. 26-3) attesting to Exhibits A through F;
• Declaration of Allen Suitor ("Suitor Decl," Doc. No. 26-10);
• Declaration of Thax Turner ("Turner Decl," Doc. No. 26-11) attesting to Exhibits A and B;
• Declaration of Andrew Sommer ("First Sommer Decl," Doc. No. 26-14) attesting to Exhibits A through G;
• Separate Statement of Facts ("SUF," Doc. [*4]  No. 26-22); and
• Request for Judicial Notice (Doc. Nos. 26-23, 26-24).
Plaintiff filed an Opposition on February 8, 2016. ("Opp'n," Doc. No. 28.) On February 9, 2016, one day after the Opposition was due, Plaintiff filed the following untimely documents:
• Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact (Doc. No. 29);
• Declaration of Titus Striplin ("Striplin Decl," Doc. No. 20-1); and
• Declaration of Rosemary Amezcua-Moll ("Amezcua-Moll Decl," Doc. No. 29-2).
Defendant filed a Reply on February 15, 2016. ("Reply," Doc. No. 30.) Defendant filed the following documents in support of its Reply:
• Reply to Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact (Doc. No. 31);
• Objections to Plaintiff's Evidence ("Def.'s Objections," Doc. No. 32); and
• Declaration of Andrew Sommer ("Second Sommer Decl," Doc. No. 33) attesting to Exhibit A.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
A motion for summary judgment shall be granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The moving party must show that "under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250.
Generally, the burden is on the moving party [*5]  to demonstrate its entitlement to summary judgment. See Margolis v. Ryan, 140 F.3d 850, 852 (9th Cir. 1998); Retail Clerks Union Local 648 v. Hub Pharmacy, Inc., 707 F.2d 1030, 1033 (9th Cir. 1983). The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying the elements of the claim or defense and evidence that it believes demonstrates the absence of an issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).
When the non-moving party has the burden at trial, however, the moving party need not produce evidence negating or disproving every essential element of the non-moving party's case. Id. at 325. Instead, the moving party's burden is met by pointing out an absence of evidence supporting the non-moving party's case. Id. The burden then shifts to the non-moving party to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved at trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. The non-moving party must make an affirmative showing on all matters placed in issue by the motion as to which it has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also William W. Schwarzer, A. Wallace Tashima & James M. Wagstaffe, Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial, 14:144. "This burden is not a light one. The non-moving party must show more than the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252). "The non-moving party must do more than show there is some 'metaphysical doubt' as to the material facts [*6]  at issue." Id. at 387 (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)).
A genuine issue of material fact exists "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir. 1991); T.W. Elec. Serv. Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Plaintiff's Factual Assertions Are Without Citation and Unsupported by the Record
The "Factual Background" section in Plaintiff's Opposition reads, "Plaintiff incorporates herein as if fully set forth the facts contained in his declaration, his separate statement of disputed facts and the declaration of his attorney Rosemary Amezcua-Moll filed in support of this opposition." (Opp'n at 5.) The Court declines to "incorporate" these documents into Plaintiff's Opposition for multiple reasons. First, the Standing Order sets page limits for oppositions. (Standing Order, Doc. No. 8.) Plaintiff may not circumvent the Standing Order by "incorporating" various documents, including Plaintiff's 58-paragraph declaration, into the Opposition. Plaintiff must make his argument within the page limits, or not make it at all. As it stands, Plaintiff has not set forth a statement of facts.
Second, [*7]  and more importantly, although the Opposition was timely filed on February 8, 2016, Plaintiff did not file his evidence, or his statement of genuine disputes of material fact, until after the February 8, 2016 deadline. Plaintiff sought to incorporate by reference documents that were not filed until February 9, 2016. In a declaration also filed on February 9, 2016, Plaintiff's counsel attests that she became ill on February 6, 2016, and that her illness, combined with a deadline in another case, prevented her from timely filing her Opposition documents. (Amezcua-Moll Decl. ¶¶ 5-8.) That may be. However, rather than contacting opposing counsel or filing an ex parte request for an extension of time, Plaintiff filed the Opposition without a fact section, evidence, or a single citation to the record backing up the myriad factual assertions in the Opposition.
Plaintiff's counsel became ill on February 6, two days before the deadline (Amezcua-Moll Decl. ¶ 6)-ample time to request an extension to file the Opposition. Instead, Plaintiff's counsel chose a course of action that prejudiced Defendant by filing Plaintiff's evidence and statement of genuine disputes of material fact six days before [*8]  the Reply was due, and muddled Plaintiff's Opposition by filing it without any citations to the record, presumably because the record did not yet exist. Plaintiff's late-filing of the facts which constitute the entire basis for opposing this Motion is inexcusable. Plaintiff cannot file a hollow Opposition on the deadline, and then fill it with late-filed factual disputes and evidence. The Opposition is not a placeholder; it is Plaintiff's sole argument for surviving summary judgment. In accordance with the Standing Order, the Court accepts the Opposition as filed on February 8, 2016, and declines to consider any untimely documents filed thereafter.

B. Undisputed Facts
For the reasons stated above, the facts in this case are undisputed. All of the factual assertions in Plaintiff's Opposition are without citation and unsupported by the record. Furthermore, Plaintiff did not file a timely statement of genuine disputes of material fact. Accordingly, except as noted, the following material facts are uncontroverted and sufficiently supported by admissible evidence. They are "admitted to exist without controversy" for purposes of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. L.R. 56-3.
Shamrock Foods Company [*9]  specializes in the manufacture and distribution of food and food-related products. (Turner Decl. ¶ 2.) Beginning in June 2011, Plaintiff was employed as an account executive at Shamrock's new branch operations in Southern California. (SUF ¶ 1.) As an account executive, Plaintiff was responsible for developing a territory by obtaining new customers and placing food orders. (SUF ¶ 2.) As of 2012, Plaintiff understood that he was expected to open two or three new customer accounts per month. (SUF ¶ 3.)

1. Plaintiff's Poor Performance
On February 6, 2013, Plaintiff was issued a performance improvement plan ("PIP") after Shamrock determined that Plaintiff had opened only one new customer account in the previous 90 days. (SUF ¶ 4.) The PIP identified that Plaintiff was expected to open "two new accounts that ship in the next 30 days." (SUF ¶ 5.) To receive credit for opening a "new account," an account executive must place at least one order for shipment by truck to a new customer, which requires a minimum order of 10 cases. (SUF ¶ 6; Turner Decl. ¶ 8; First Sommer Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. B ("Striplin Depo., Vol. 2") 256:11-18.) Plaintiff did not open any new accounts yielding orders over ten cases [*10]  in either February or March 2013. (SUF ¶ 8.)
On March 20, 2013, after conferring with other managers and reviewing Plaintiff's sales performance, Branch Sales Manager, Thax Turner ("Turner"), made the decision to terminate Plaintiff based on his poor sales performance. (SUF ¶ 9.) At the time of his termination, Plaintiff posted the lowest gross profit of any account executive within his region. (SUF ¶ 10; First Sommer Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. E ("Turner Depo.") 38:15-39:21.)

2. Plaintiff's Termination
On March 21, 2013, Allen Suitor ("Suitor"), the District Sales Manager and Plaintiff's immediate supervisor, called Plaintiff in the early afternoon and asked Plaintiff to meet him at a local café at around 4:00 p.m. (Suitor Decl. ¶ 2; First Sommer Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A ("Striplin Depo., Vol. 1") 170:03-25; 171:01-175:10.) Suitor and Regional Sales Manager Dean Curtis ("Curtis") were waiting outside the café with Plaintiff's termination paperwork in hand. (Suitor Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff called Suitor to say he was running late. (Id.) Suitor then watched Plaintiff drive right by the café without stopping. (Id.) At 5:01 p.m., Plaintiff sent Curtis a text message stating, "Had to go to the ER . . . I'll touch [*11]  base with you in the am." (Id.) Before Plaintiff sent the text message, Plaintiff's final paycheck had already been mailed to Plaintiff's residence next day delivery. (Hergert Decl. ¶ 3.)
Shamrock attempted to contact Plaintiff to inform him of his termination. (Turner Decl. ¶ 11.) Unable to reach Plaintiff, at 10:23 a.m. on March 22, 2013, Turner sent an email to Plaintiff, followed by a letter, informing him that his employment had been terminated. (Id.)
Later in the afternoon of March 22, 2013, Plaintiff emailed Shamrock HR Director Monica Hergert requesting a medical leave of absence and enclosing a doctor's certificate. (SUF ¶ 11.) At no time prior to the termination decision did Plaintiff request a medical leave of absence or indicate that he had any health problems necessitating medical leave or any workplace accommodation. (SUF ¶ 18.)
Plaintiff alleges that he suffered from work-related stress, and that he was terminated because of that alleged disability, and because Plaintiff complained about Defendant's alleged violations of a court order. Regarding the latter, Plaintiff asserts that beginning in mid-2012, he inquired as to why his name appeared on reports for accounts associated [*12]  with his co-worker Julia Linza ("Linza"). (SUF ¶ 13.) Plaintiff had allegedly heard in the employee breakroom that Linza could not work on certain accounts, (SUF ¶ 14), but he has presented no evidence that Linza was in fact prohibited from working on any account. Although there was an injunction prohibiting Shamrock from soliciting the customers of US Foods, the injunction did not name Linza and did not prohibit Linza from working on any specific customer account. (SUF ¶ 16.) Plaintiff did not follow up with anyone at Shamrock to confirm whether Linza was in fact prohibited by a court order from working on any US Foods accounts. (SUF ¶ 15.) Although Plaintiff claims he suspected his name was being used to cover up Linza and Shamrock's violation of a court order, (Opp'n at 6), Plaintiff has not submitted any admissible evidence demonstrating that Shamrock, Linza or Plaintiff violated a court order.

3. Wage Statements and Wages Paid Upon Plaintiff's Termination
During Plaintiff's employment, Shamrock provided floating holidays to full-time California employees. (SUF ¶ 19.) As a regular practice, any accrued, unused floating holidays were cashed out. (SUF ¶ 19.) All floating holidays that [*13]  Plaintiff accrued and did not use in 2013 were paid to Plaintiff upon his termination. (SUF ¶ 20; Hergert Decl. ¶ 6, Exs. D & E.)1

C. Plaintiff's Claims for Violations of the FMLA and the CFRA
Plaintiff concedes that summary judgment is appropriate as to Plaintiff's Second and Third Causes of action under the FMLA and CFRA. (Opp'n at 5.) Accordingly, Defendant's Motion is GRANTED as to these causes of action.

D. Plaintiff's Claims for Violations of California Labor Code Section 1102.5

1. Subsection 1102.5(b)
Plaintiff concedes summary adjudication as to Plaintiff's claims under section 1102.5(b) of the California Labor Code. (Opp'n at 6.) Accordingly, summary judgment is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim under section 1102.5(b).

2. Subsection 1102.5(c)
Section 1102.5(c) of the California Labor Code provides that an employer may not retaliate against an employee for "refusing to participate in any activity that would result in a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation." Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5(c). To establish a prima facie case under section 1102.5(c), a plaintiff must establish that: (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) the defendant [*14]  subjected him to an adverse employment action; and (3) that there is a causal link between the two. Mokler v. County of Orange, 157 Cal. App. 4th 121, 138, 68 Cal. Rptr. 3d 568 (2007). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. at 140. The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to prove the defendant's proffered reasons are pretextual. Id.
Plaintiff contends that he objected to the use of his name on reports for accounts associated with his co-worker, Julia Linza, because he believed Defendant was using his name to conceal that Shamrock was soliciting US Foods customers in violation of a court-ordered injunction.
Plaintiff fails to establish a prima facie case in multiple respects. First, Plaintiff has not submitted any admissible evidence showing that Shamrock or Linza violated a court order, or that Plaintiff would also have violated the court order if Defendant included his name on Linza's reports. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to establish that his participation in the alleged activity would have resulted in a violation of any kind.
Second, Plaintiff has not submitted any admissible evidence indicating that he was subjected to an adverse employment [*15]  action on account of his refusal to include his name on Julia Linza's reports. Plaintiff does not address causality in his Opposition, nor does he address Defendant's proffered non-discriminatory reason for his termination: Plaintiff's sub-par performance. Accordingly, because Plaintiff has failed to set establish a prima facie case for a violation under section 1102.5(c), Defendant's Motion is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's fourth cause of action.

E. Plaintiff's Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Causes of Action for Violations of the FEHA

1. Disability Discrimination
In order to prevail on Plaintiff's claims for disability discrimination under the FEHA, Plaintiff must first demonstrate that he "(1) . . . suffers from a disability; (2) . . . is otherwise qualified to do his job; and, (3) . . . was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability." Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 344, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654, 668 (2008). Defendant asserts that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because "[a]n employee's inability to work under a particular supervisor because of anxiety and stress related to the supervisor's standard oversight of the employee's job performance does not constitute a disability under FEHA." Higgins-Williams v. Sutter Med. Found., 237 Cal. App. 4th 78, 84, 187 Cal. Rptr. 3d 745, 750 (2015).
Plaintiff asserts that he was diagnosed [*16]  with "workplace-related stress" and testified in deposition that the stress was caused by his supervisor's job-related performance expectations. (SUF ¶ 17; Striplin Depo, Vol. 2, 286:15-287-:05.) At his deposition, Plaintiff stated that he first began experiencing stress-related symptoms after conversations with his supervisor, Allen Suitor, in September or October of 2012, concerning prospecting accounts. (Striplin Depo, Vol. 2, 286:15-287:12.) Workplace-related stress caused by standard oversight of an employee's job performance is not a recognized disability under the FEHA. See Higgins-Williams, 237 Cal. App. 4th at 84; Hobson v. Raychem Corp., 73 Cal. App. 4th 614, 628, 86 Cal. Rptr. 2d 497 (1999). See also Banuelos v. UPS Ground Freight, Inc., No. CV 15-2408 PA (AJWX), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 246, 2016 WL 47259, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 4, 2016). Thus, Plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine dispute that he suffered from a disability cognizable under the FEHA.
Even if his workplace-related stress could be considered a disability under the FEHA, Plaintiff fails to state a prima facie case because the undisputed facts establish that Defendant had no knowledge of Plaintiff's alleged disability when Defendant made the decision to terminate him. "An adverse employment decision cannot be made 'because of' a disability, when the disability is not known to the employer." Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 236, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997). See also Trop v. Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., 129 Cal. App. 4th 1133, 1145, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 144 (2005) ("An employee [*17]  cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination based on pregnancy under FEHA in the absence of evidence the employer knew the employee was pregnant."). A plaintiff must prove the employer had knowledge of the disability when the adverse employment decision was made. "While knowledge of the disability can be inferred from the circumstances, knowledge will only be imputed to the employer when the fact of disability is the only reasonable interpretation of the known facts." Jackson v. Kaplan Higher Educ., LLC, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75906, at *9-10 (E.D. Cal. June 10, 2015). An employee's "vague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations under the FEHA." Brundage, 57 Cal. App. 4th at 236. A plaintiff must present evidence that the employer was aware of a disability, not merely an illness. For example, doctor's notes stating that an employee is excused from work or hospital paperwork indicating that a plaintiff stayed for a time in a hospital are insufficient to demonstrate that an employer has notice that an employee has a qualifying disability under the FEHA. See Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1253, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008) (holding that hospital notes demonstrating plaintiff's four-day stay in hospital did not put employer on notice of qualifying disability).
It is undisputed that Plaintiff [*18]  did not disclose any diagnosed health condition to Defendant before the decision was made to terminate him. At most, management was aware that Defendant had a doctor's appointment, but no diagnosis had been made and Plaintiff presents no evidence that he had otherwise communicated to Defendant that he had a disability. Defendant was not on notice of Plaintiff's alleged disability until he submitted a doctor's note on March 22, 2013, two days after Defendant decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment on March 20, 2013. (SUF ¶ 11.)

2. Failure to Accommodate and Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Plaintiff next contends that Defendant failed to make reasonable accommodations for Plaintiff and failed to engage in the interactive process in violation of the FEHA. Section 12940(m) of the California Government Code provides that it is unlawful "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee." Under the FEHA, it is also unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for [*19]  accommodation by an employee . . . ." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). In order to state a prima facie case for failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he "tender[ed] a specific request for a necessary accommodation." King v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 443, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007) (quoting Spitzer v. Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1384, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000)).
As with Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim, Plaintiff's failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process claims fail because Plaintiff has not established that he suffers from a qualifying disability under the FEHA. Moreover, even if his workplace-related stress did qualify as a disability, it is undisputed that Plaintiff did not request an accommodation for a disability or indicate a need for an accommodation prior to his termination. Plaintiff did not request leave until after the termination decision was made.
In Opposition, Plaintiff contends he had a conversation with Turner and Greg Otterbein ("Otterbein") on March 8, 2013, however Plaintiff's discussion of this alleged conversation is entirely without citation and unsupported by admissible evidence.2 Plaintiff also contends that he emailed human resources regarding his "stress related illness" and doctor's appointment, but this is also without citation [*20]  to the record.3
With no evidence presented to the contrary, it is undisputed that Plaintiff did not request an accommodation for a disability or indicate a need for an accommodation prior to his termination. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to his claims of disability discrimination, failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process under the FEHA. Defendant's Motion is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh [*21]  Causes of Action under the FEHA.

F. Plaintiff's Claim for Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
Plaintiff contends that he was wrongfully discharged in retaliation for complaining about Defendant's use of Plaintiff's name on Linza's accounts, allegedly to cover up violations of a court order. (Opp'n at 9.) He contends that "his complaints and refusal to participate was in furtherance of the public policy favoring following court orders." (Id.)
"The central assertion of a claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy is that the employer's motives for terminating the employee are so contrary to fundamental norms that the termination inflicted an injury sounding in tort." Roby v. McKesson Corp., 47 Cal. 4th 686, 702, 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 773, 219 P.3d 749 (2009). The California Supreme Court has cautioned that "courts in wrongful discharge actions may not declare public policy without a basis in either constitutional or statutory provisions. . . . [T]he public policy exception presents no impediment to employers that operate within the bounds of law." Gantt v. Sentry Insurance, 1 Cal. 4th 1083, 1094, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 874, 824 P.2d 680 (1992), overruled on other grounds by Green v. Ralee Engineering Co., 19 Cal. 4th 66, 80 n.6, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (1998). "To support a wrongful discharge claim, the policy must be (1) delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) public in the sense that it inures to the benefit [*22]  of the public rather than serving merely the interests of the individual; (3) well established at the time of the discharge; and (4) substantial and fundamental." Phillips v. St. Mary Reg'l Med. Ctr., 96 Cal. App. 4th 218, 226, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 770 (2002).
Plaintiff has not established that Defendant violated any constitutional or statutory law, either by including Plaintiff on Linza's accounts or otherwise, therefore his claim of wrongful discharge fails. See Ramirez v. AvalonBay Cmtys., Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130475, 2015 WL 5675866, at *11 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2015) ("Where no predicate violation of the law has occurred, a plaintiff cannot state a claim for wrongful termination in violation of the law.") Indeed, Plaintiff does not even allege that Defendant fired him for refusing to violate a statutory or constitutional provision. He claims that he was fired to refusing to participate in actions that allegedly violated a court order. Even if refusal to violate a court order can support a wrongful discharge claim, Plaintiff has not presented any admissible evidence demonstrating that Defendant, Linza or Plaintiff violated the court order, or would have violated the court order by including Plaintiff's name on Linza's accounts. Thus, Plaintiff fails to establish a prima facie case for wrongful discharge. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment on Plaintiff's wrongful termination [*23]  claim.

G. Plaintiff's Claim for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotion distress ("IIED") claim is preempted by California Labor Code § 3600(a), the California Worker's Compensation Act ("WCA"). The WCA provides that "[l]iability for the compensation provided by [the Act], in lieu of any other liability whatsoever . . . shall . . . exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the employment . . . ." If the alleged wrongful conduct occurs at the worksite, during the normal course of the employer-employee relationship, workers' compensation is the exclusive remedy for any injury that results. Miklosy v. Regents of Univ. of California, 44 Cal. 4th 876, 902, 80 Cal. Rptr. 3d 690, 188 P.3d 629 (2008). "Emotional injuries caused by workplace discipline, including termination, fall within this rule." Yau v. Santa Margarita Ford, Inc., 229 Cal. App. 4th 144, 161, 176 Cal. Rptr. 3d 824, 836 (2014).
Plaintiff relies on an exception to the general rule of WCA preemption when the IIED claim is based on conduct that violates a fundamental public policy. (Opp'n at 9-10.) See Huffman v. Interstate Brands Cos., 121 Cal. App. 4th 679, 17 Cal. Rptr. 3d 397 (2004); Shoemaker v. Myers, 52 Cal. 3d 1, 7, 276 Cal. Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054 (1990); Hentzel v. Singer Co., 138 Cal. App. 3d 290, 188 Cal. Rptr. 159 (1982). However, those cases were decided prior to Miklosky, in which the California Supreme Court held that the exception to WCA preemption for employer conduct that contravenes public policy is aimed at permitting a Tameny action for wrongful discharge [*24]  in violation of public policy. Miklosy, 44 Cal. 4th at 902-903. The exception does not allow a "distinct cause of action, not dependent upon the violation of an express statute or violation of fundamental public policy." Id. Miklosky held that even "severe emotional distress arising from outrageous conduct that occurred at the worksite in the normal course of the employer-employee relationship" is the type of injury that falls exclusively within the purview of the WCA. Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (barring plaintiff's IIED claim when plaintiff also brought claim for wrongful termination and whistle-blowing retaliation, based upon the same conduct).
Plaintiff's IIED claim is entirely premised on his allegedly wrongful termination. (Compl. ¶¶ 116-17.) Therefore, under Miklosky, Plaintiff's IIED claim is preempted by the WCA. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to Plaintiff's IIED claim.

H. Plaintiff's Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Causes of Action Concerning Floating Holidays
Plaintiff asserts claims under §§ 224, 226 and 201 of the California Labor Code. He contends that his final paycheck was missing one day of vacation of time, though he offers no admissible evidence in support of this contention. [*25]  Defendant has submitted declarations and paystubs indicating Plaintiff was paid for all vacation days and floating holidays. (SUF ¶ 20; Hergert Decl. ¶ 6, Exs. D & E.)
Section 224 prohibits employers from withholding wages or earnings from an employee, "except those deductions specifically authorized by statute." Lindell v. Synthes USA, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1940, 2016 WL 70305, at *13 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 6, 2016). Plaintiff has not submitted any admissible evidence showing that he was not paid all wages earned, therefore he has not established a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether he was paid all wages earned. Accordingly, summary judgment is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's section 224 claim.
Based on the same alleged facts, Plaintiff contends that Defendant violated § 201 of the California Labor Code. Under § 201, employers are required to pay an employee "the wages earned and unpaid at the time of discharge." Cal. Lab. Code § 201. Thus, because Plaintiff has not established a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether he was paid all wages owed, the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to Plaintiff's section 201 claim.
Under § 226 of the California Labor Code, employers are required to furnish their employees accurate itemized wage statements containing certain information. Cal. Lab. Code § 226. Plaintiff contends the wage statements he received were inaccurate because they failed to show all deductions taken and reported [*26]  payment for floating holidays for which he allegedly did not receive payment. As Plaintiff has not established a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether he was paid all wages owed, he has also not established a genuine dispute as to whether his wage statements were inaccurate for failing to pay all wages owed.
Separately, Plaintiff contends his wage statements violate section 226 because they did not contain his full social security number. Section 226 does not require the inclusion of an employee's full security number; it only requires the last four digits or an employee identification number other than a social security number. Cal. Lab. Code § 226(a). Plaintiff's wage statement properly included an employee identification number and all wages paid. (SUF ¶ 22.) Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to Plaintiff's section 226 claim for relief.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and dismisses Plaintiff's Complaint WITH PREJUDICE. The March 28, 2016 hearing on the Motion is VACATED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
