DECISION AND ORDER GRANTING THE DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND DENYING PLAINTIFF'S CROSS-MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT

I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Craig M. Steffen ("Steffen") worked as a part-time mail handler for the United States Postal Service ("USPS") at its Milwaukee Processing and Distribution Center from 1987 until he was terminated on January 10, 2006. (Docket No. 30 at 3, ¶1.) In November of 1998, Steffen reported that he was injured while on the job and was off work for about two weeks. (Docket No. 30 at 4, ¶¶3-6.) Steffen alleges he reinjured himself at work on May 5, 2003. (Docket No. 30 at 5, ¶11.) Aside from a week in July of 2003, (Docket No. 30 at 6, ¶14), Steffen did not ever return to work for USPS following this incident, and he [*2]  was eventually terminated two-and-half years later on January 10, 2006.
During the period Steffen was off work, Steffen's supervisor, Charles Spahn ("Spahn") made repeated efforts to have Steffen return to work or to obtain medical documentation to support Steffen's prolonged absence. These efforts included contacting Steffen's union and sending multiple letters to Steffen informing him what was required for him to remain on leave. (Docket No. 30 at 6-8, ¶18-26.) On January 3, 2005, Steffen received a letter from Spahn informing him that he would be terminated effective February 11, 2005. (Docket No. 30 at 8, ¶26.) In response, Steffen contacted his union who initiated a grievance on his behalf, and on October 6, 2005, Steffen and the USPS entered into a "Pre-Arbitration Settlement Agreement" ("Agreement"). (Docket No. 30 at 8-9, ¶¶27, 33, 36; Docket No. 31-18.)
The Agreement required that if Steffen's physician determined at an upcoming appointment that Steffen was able to return to work, Steffen must then contact the USPS for a fitness for duty examination. (Docket No. 30 at 9-10, ¶37.) If Steffen was unable to return to full duty, the Agreement provided that Steffen would apply for [*3]  disability retirement within 30 days of his physician's findings. (Docket No. 30 at 10, ¶38.) If Steffen did not apply or qualify for disability retirement, then Steffen was required to resign with 15 days of that determination. (Docket No. 30 at 10, ¶38.)
The USPS' representative regarding the Agreement, Emma Hughes ("Hughes"), understood the term "full duty" to require Steffen to be able to return to work without any restrictions or accommodation. (Docket No. 30 at 11, ¶44.) Steffen's physician cleared him to return to work as of December 12, 2005 but imposed permanent restrictions of lifting, pushing, and pulling no more than 25 pounds, limited standing to 2 hours at a time, recommended avoiding repetitive bending, stooping, climbing, reaching, and twisting, and encouraged alternate sitting and standing. (Docket No. 30 at 13, ¶56; Docket No. 31-21.) Another treating physician indicated similar limitations. (Docket No. 30 at 13, ¶57; Docket No. 31-22.) The USPS' physician determined that based upon these restrictions, Steffen was unfit for "full duty." (Docket No. 30 at 14, ¶58; Docket No. 31-20.) Steffen did not apply for disability retirement, nor did he resign from the USPS. (Docket [*4]  No. 30 at 14, ¶60.) Therefore, Steffen was terminated on January 10, 2006. (Docket No. 30 at 14, ¶61.)
Steffen proceeded with a grievance against the USPS but this grievance was dismissed when the arbitrator determined that the grievance was not subject to arbitration. (Docket No. 30 at 15, ¶¶65-68; Docket No. 31-25.) Steffen then filed a complaint with the EEOC. (Docket No. 30 at 15, ¶69.) After nearly three years of investigation, the EEOC found no discrimination occurred. (Docket No. 30 at 17-18, ¶¶77-78.)
Proceeding pro se, Steffen initiated the present action on February 5, 2009. (Docket No. 1.) Upon all parties consenting to the full jurisdiction of a magistrate judge, (Docket Nos. 3, 6, 7), this case was reassigned to this court for all further proceedings, (Docket No. 9). Steffen subsequently retained counsel, and the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. (Docket No. 17.) The parties later stipulated to allow the plaintiff to file a second amended complaint. (Docket No. 26.) As part of this stipulation the plaintiff agreed that he was alleging only that the USPS discriminated against him because it "regarded him as an individual with a disability or disabilities," and that he [*5]  was waiving any "claim that he was subjected to discrimination based on actual disability or disabilities." (Docket No. 26.)
On January 13, 2011, the defendant moved for summary judgment. (Docket No. 29.) The plaintiff filed his own cross-motion for partial summary judgment on February 7, 2011. (Docket No. 35.) Each party has responded to the opponent's respective motion for summary judgment, (Docket Nos. 36, 43), and each party has replied, (Docket Nos. 42, 46). The pleadings on the parties' motions for summary judgment are closed and the matters are ready for resolution.

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); McNeal v. Macht, 763 F. Supp. 1458, 1460-61 (E.D. Wis. 1991). Material facts are those facts which, under the governing substantive law, might affect the outcome of the suit. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. A dispute of such material facts is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of the nonmoving party. Id.
The movant bears the burden to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he or she is entitled to judgment as [*6]  a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); see also Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323. The moving party satisfies its burden by demonstrating "that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. Any doubt as to the existence of a genuine issue for trial is resolved against the moving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255; Cain v. Lane, 857 F.2d 1139, 1142 (7th Cir. 1988); Spring v. Sheboygan Area School Dist., 865 F.2d 883, 886 (7th Cir. 1989). Further, "on summary judgment, a court can neither make a credibility determination nor choose between competing interests." Sarsha v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 3 F.3d 1035, 1041 (7th Cir. 1993).
If the moving party meets its burden, the nonmoving party then has the burden to present specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).

III. ANALYSIS
Because Steffen's former employer is the federal government, it is the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehab Act") that applies to his discrimination claims and not the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12111 et seq., which covers most claims of disability discrimination in the employment setting. Nonetheless, because the Rehab Act largely mirrors the ADA, when discrimination in an employment context is alleged the same standards that apply to an ADA claim are applicable to a claim under the Rehab Act. Peters v. City of Mauston, 311 F.3d 835, 842 (7th Cir. 2002) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 794(d); Vande Zande v. State of Wis. Dept. of Admin., 44 F.3d 538, 542 (7th Cir. 1995)).
A plaintiff who alleges he was discriminated against due to an actual or perceived disability may seek to prove [*7]  his claim in one of two ways. Buie v. Quad/Graphics, Inc., 366 F.3d 496, 503 (7th Cir. 2004). The direct method generally requires an explicit admission by the employer that the decision was made for a prohibited reason. Radue v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 219 F.3d 612, 616 (7th Cir. 2000). Because such direct evidence is rare, it is far more common for plaintiffs to utilize the indirect method of proof. The indirect method of proof utilizes the well-established McDonnell Douglas, see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), burden shifting scheme where the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Steffen would set forth a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA if he is able to show: (1) the USPS regarded him as disabled; (2) he was qualified to perform the essential functions of this job with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (3) he suffered an adverse employment action because of his perceived disability. Buie, 366 F.3d at 503; see also Garg v. Potter, 521 F.3d 731, 736 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing Scheerer v. Potter, 443 F.3d 916, 918 (7th Cir. 2006); Peters v. City of Mauston, 311 F.3d 835, 842 (7th Cir. 2002)). If Steffen were to put forth a prima facie case, the burden would then shift to the USPS to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its adverse employment action. Id. If the USPS were to meet its burden, then the burden would shift back to Steffen to demonstrate that the USPS' proffered reasons were a pretext for discrimination. Id.
According to his second amended [*8]  complaint, Steffen alleges that the defendant violated the Rehab Act by
discriminating against Steffen in the terms and conditions of employment, by failing to provide reasonable accommodations for known disabilities, by failing to engage in an interactive process with Steffen regarding his disabilities, by discharging Steffen based on his disabilities, including because he was regarded as an individual with a disability or disabilities.
(Docket No. 27 at 5, ¶35.) Specifically, Steffen contends that the requirement contained in the Agreement that Steffen return to work only if he is able to perform his job duties without any restrictions or accommodation violated the Rehab Act. In Steffen's view, imposing such a requirement is a per se violation of the Rehab Act and therefore he is entitled to summary judgment in his favor.
The defendant contends that the plaintiff's case must fail because there is no evidence that the USPS regarded Steffen as disabled, and even if he could present evidence sufficient to satisfy this element, the evidence demonstrates that the USPS had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason to terminate him

A. Impact of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008
The Rehab Act, relying upon the definition of disability contained [*9]  within the ADA, see 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B); 42 U.S.C. § 12102, prohibits discrimination based upon the belief that an individual has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.
In 2008, the Rehab Act and the ADA were amended and these amendments impacted this "regarded as" prong. ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553. This law became effective January 1, 2009. Because Steffen was terminated in 2006, these amendments do not directly govern Steffen claim. See Fredricksen v. UPS, Inc., 581 F.3d 516, 520, n.1 (7th Cir. 2009). Nonetheless, Steffen contends that these amendments should guide the court's consideration of his claim because, in his view, "the Amendments Act simply clarifies misinterpretations of the ADA." (Docket No. 36 at 6.)
Under the prior law courts held that
[a] plaintiff may prove that he is an individual with a disability under the 'regarded as' prong of the Rehabilitation Act 'by showing that either: 1) the employer mistakenly believes the employee has a physical impairment that substantially limits a major life activity; or 2) the employer mistakenly believes that an actual, non-limiting impairment substantially limits a major life activity.'
Branham v. Snow, 392 F.3d 896, 904 (7th Cir. 2004) (quoting Peters, 311 F.3d at 843).
In the Amendments Act, Congress found that courts had not applied the definition of disability consistent with Congress' expectations, [*10]  and thus "lower courts have incorrectly found in individual cases that people with a range of substantially limiting impairments are not people with disabilities." Pub. L. No. 110-325. The sources of the lower courts' misinterpretation were, in Congress' view, the Supreme Court's holdings Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999), and Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002). Because Congress believed that the threshold set by the Court that must be satisfied before an individual would be protected by the ADA was inappropriately high, it sought to explicitly reverse the holdings of these cases by codifying a lower threshold.
With respect to the term "being regarded as having such an impairment," Congress codified its own definition to supersede the court created definitions. Under the new law,
[a]n individual meets the requirement of "being regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this Act because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.
42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A). Thus, with the 2008 amendments, a plaintiff proceeding under the "regarded as" prong need not prove that the employer believed that he had an impairment that [*11]  limited a major life activity; discrimination against an employee for any perceived impairment would violate the ADA and the Rehab Act.
From Steffen's perspective, Congress made clear in the Amendments Act that the standards it now codified, had always been, in Congress' view, the proper standards to apply to an ADA or Rehab Act claim. Because Congress was merely codifying what it had always regarded as the proper legal standards, courts should be willing to consider the 2008 amendments when applying the ADA or Rehab Act to actions that occurred prior to the effective date of the amendments.
Steffen's argument is merely a somewhat creatively repackaged retroactivity argument, and the Seventh Circuit has concluded that the 2008 amendments are not retroactive. Fredricksen, 581 F.3d at 520, n.1; Kimble v. Potter, 390 Fed. Appx. 601, 603 (7th Cir. 2010) (unpublished). Regardless of what Congress now says it meant to say, what is controlling is what it actually said. Courts across the country, including the United States Supreme Court, in fulfillment of their constitutional duties under the United States' tripartite system of government, conclusively determined that Congress had not said what it now says it intended. In response, Congress proceeded as it is entitled and changed [*12]  the law. Irrespective of whether Congress tried to characterize its action as merely clarifying its original intent, the Amendments Act undisputedly changed the law. An employer can generally be expected to comply only with laws as they are at the time of a certain action, not as laws might be at some point in the future. Because Congress did not say otherwise, the Amendments Act applies to only matters occurring after the law's effective date. Therefore, the court rejects Steffen's contention that the 2008 amendments have any impact upon this case. In order to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination, Steffen must present evidence that the USPS perceived Steffen to be suffering from an impairment that limited a major life activity.

B. "Regarded As" Disabled
The record demonstrates that the USPS was aware that Steffen had certain motor limitations, such as lifting, pushing, or pulling no more than 25 pounds and standing for more than 2 hours at a time. (Docket No. 30 at 13, ¶56; see also Docket No. 31-20.) Steffen's physician also recommended that he avoid repetitive bending, stooping, climbing, reaching, and twisting, and encouraged alternate sitting and standing. (Docket No. [*13]  30 at 13, ¶56.) However, to fall under the protection of the statute, a person must establish that he has a disability that substantially limits a major life activity. The plaintiffs limitations do not satisfy this requirement.
The arguable major life activity here is that of working.
To be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, then, one must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice. If jobs utilizing an individual's skills (but perhaps not his or her unique talents) are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of different types of jobs are available, one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.
Sutton v. United Air Lines, 527 U.S. 471, 492, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999); see also Kupstas v. City of Greenwood, 398 F.3d 609, 614 (7th Cir. 2005) ("[Plaintiff s] failure to provide evidence as to a class or range of jobs for which he otherwise was qualified, and from which [the defendant] perceived him to be excluded, is fatal to his case.")
In Contreras v. Suncast Corp., 237 F.3d 756, 763 (7th Cir. 2001), the Seventh Circuit concluded that an individual was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working when he was "unable to lift in excess of 45 pounds for a long period of time, unable to engage in strenuous work, and unable to drive a forklift [*14]  for more than four hours a day." The court noted that the plaintiff "has not presented evidence that even hints at the notion that he is precluded from a broad class of jobs," and therefore, relying upon similar decisions from other circuits, concluded restrictions such as these do not amount to substantial limitations of a major life activity. Id. (citing Williams v. Channel Master Satellite Sys., Inc., 101 F.3d 346, 349 (4th Cir. 1996) (holding as a matter of law that "twenty-five pound lifting limitation--particularly when compared to an average person's abilities--does not constitute a significant restriction on one's ability to lift, work, or perform any other major life activity"); Aucutt v. Six Flags Over Mid-America, 85 F.3d 1311, 1319 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding plaintiff failed to show he was substantially limited in major life activities where "a 25-pound lifting restriction was the only medical limitation placed upon [plaintiffs] activities"); Ray v. Glidden Co., 85 F.3d 227, 228-29 (5th Cir. 1996) (holding that inability to continuously lift containers weighing on average 44-56 pounds "does not render a person substantially limited in the major life activities of lifting or working"); Wooten v. Farmland Foods, 58 F.3d 382, 384, 386 (8th Cir. 1995) (plaintiff not substantially limited in major life activity of working where plaintiff was restricted to light duty with no working in cold environment and no lifting items weighing more than 20 [*15]  pounds)); see also Duncan v. Washington Metro. Area Trans. Auth., 240 F.3d 1110, 1115, 345 U.S. App. D.C. 170 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (en banc) (overturning jury verdict in favor of plaintiff with 25-pound lifting restriction, and requiring proof regarding the number of other jobs in the same geographical area that plaintiff was excluded from).
Recently, the Seventh Circuit again addressed this issue in Kotwica v. Rose Packing Co., 637 F.3d 744, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 5849 (7th Cir. Mar. 22, 2011), where a general laborer at a meat packing plant sued under the ADA after her employer refused to allow her to return to work following hip replacement surgery. The court affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in the employer's favor on the basis that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that she qualified for protection under the ADA as a person regarded as having a disability. Id. The plaintiff's personal physician concluded that she was permanently precluded from lifting more than 25 pounds and based upon this limitation, the meat packing plant determined that she was unfit for the position of general laborer. Id. Although it was readily apparent that the employer knew of the plaintiffs hip replacement surgery and the limitations that resulted from it, "[t]hese facts alone, however, are not enough to establish that [the defendant] considered [the plaintiff] to be unable to [*16]  work generally. Id. (citing Fredrickson, 581 F.3d at 523-24; EEOC v. Schneider, 481 F.3d 507, 510-512 (7th Cir. 2007)).
An employer who is aware of an employee's occupational limitations does not necessarily regard that employee as disabled. The employer may even offer certain accommodations for an employee without necessarily regarding that individual as disabled under the ADA or Rehab Act. Kupstas, 398 F.3d at 614. Although Steffen has presented evidence that the USPS was aware that he suffered from certain alleged limitations, Steffen has failed to present evidence that the USPS believed that these occupational limitations excluded Steffen from a broad class of jobs. Therefore, Steffen has failed to present sufficient evidence to support a finding that the USPS believed Steffen's limitations substantially limited the major life activity of working. In light of the parties' stipulation that the plaintiff is not alleging that he was subjected to discrimination based on actual disability or disabilities, (Docket No. 26, ¶4), the court need not consider this alternative argument. Accordingly, Steffen has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.

C. Legitimate Non-Discriminatory Reason
The defendant contends that irrespective of whether Steffen is able to establish a prima facie case, [*17]  the USPS had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason to terminate Steffen and therefore his claim fails at this step of the burden shifting framework. (Docket No. 30 at 29-32.) Specifically, the defendant contends that the decision to terminate Steffen was made wholly upon his attendance records, his failure to comply with the Agreement, and the medical assessment determining that Steffen was unfit for duty.
The Agreement states that Steffen will be "returned to duty provided he successfully meets all medical requirements for his position." (Docket No. 31-18 at 1.) The parties agree that this provision requires that before he may return to work, Steffen must be 100% healed, i.e. able to perform the full duties of his job without an accommodation. It is undisputed that Steffen's failure to satisfy this provision of the Agreement was the crucial fact that led to Steffen's termination. Assuming that Steffen was able to demonstrate that the USPS regarded him as disabled based upon his limitations (a burden, the court reiterates, Steffen has failed to satisfy), one would be hard pressed to imagine a more direct violation of the ADA or the Rehab Act than terminating a person because he was [*18]  unable to perform his job without an accommodation.
Although the defendant seeks to couch this argument as essentially a termination for a breach of a contract, the undisputed fact remains that the USPS terminated an employee instead of considering whether it was appropriate to provide an accommodation for Steffen's perceived disability. Rather than being a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for termination, if the USPS regarded Steffen as a person with a disability, this would have been a wholly illegitimate and explicitly discriminatory reason for termination. Requiring that Steffen to be 100% healed does not necessarily relate to his job requirements. For example, even if an employee remained precluded from lifting more than 25 pounds, he would not be 100% healed, but this would not necessarily limit his ability to do his job if his job did not require such lifting. Cf. Hendricks-Robinson v. Excel Corp., 154 F.3d 685, 699 (7th Cir. Ill. 1998) (citing Heise v. Genuine Parts Co., 900 F. Supp. 1137, 1154 & n.10 (D. Minn. 1995) (holding that a "must be cured" or "100% healed" policy is a per se violation of the ADA because the policy does not allow a case-by-case assessment of an individual's ability to perform essential functions of the individual's job, with or without accommodation); Hutchinson v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 883 F. Supp. 379 (N.D. Iowa 1995) (same).
This is precisely what the ADA [*19]  and the Rehab Act prohibit. The fact that this provision came about as a result of a mutual agreement between the USPS and Steffen does not change the court's analysis. If it was possible to vitiate an employee's rights under the ADA and Rehab Act through employment agreements, given the disproportionate power generally held by the employer in an employment relationship, employees would be routinely forced to give up their basic rights as a condition of obtaining or maintaining their jobs. Such a result would be antithetical to Congress' intent.

D. Per Se Violation of the Rehab Act
Notwithstanding his failure to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination, Steffen believes that summary judgment in his favor is appropriate because the defendant's requirement that Steffen be 100% healed before he was allowed to return to work was a per se violation of the Rehab Act. (Docket No. 36 at 2-4.)
In Hutchinson v. United Parcel Serv., 883 F. Supp. 379 (N.D. Iowa 1995), after determining that the plaintiff was not disabled under the meaning of the ADA, the court went on to consider whether UPS' policy requiring that an injured employee be "100% healed" before returning to work was a per se violation of the ADA. Id. at 396. The court concluded that such a policy would [*20]  be a per se violation of the ADA because "[s]uch a policy would on its face 'discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to . . . terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.'" Id. at 396-97 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); also citing Bombrys v. City of Toledo, 849 F. Supp. 1210, 1216-19 (N.D. Ohio 1993) (holding that irrebuttable presumption that applicant could not perform essential job functions because of insulin-dependent diabetes violated ADA and 14th Amendment); Sarsycki v. United Parcel Service, 862 F. Supp. 336 (W.D. Okl. 1994) (same)). However, the court ultimately concluded in Hutchinson that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring a claim for a per se violation of the ADA because she was not a person with a disability within the meaning of the ADA. Id. at 398.
Relying upon Hutchinson (and similar cases) it is now well-established that such "100% healed" requirements are per se violations the ADA and the Rehab Act; it is similarly well-settled that in order to pursue such a claim of a per se violation of the ADA or Rehab Act, the plaintiff must demonstrate that he is disabled under the ADA. See Hohider v. UPS, 574 F.3d 169, 195-196 (3d Cir. Pa. 2009) (citing Warmsley v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 308 F. Supp. 2d 114, 119-22 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (finding the existence of a "100% healed" policy per se satisfies plaintiffs showing of discrimination on the basis of disability, but also requiring that plaintiff be "disabled" and "otherwise [*21]  qualified" to have an ADA claim); Hammer v. Bd. of Educ., 955 F. Supp. 921, 927 (N.D. Ill. 1997) (denying plaintiff's request for summary judgment with respect to the claim that defendant "committed a per se violation of the ADA" by implementing an alleged "no work restrictions" policy, in part because "there [wa]s a genuine question of fact regarding whether or not plaintiff was capable of performing the essential functions of his job either with or without reasonable accommodation"); Norris v. Allied-Sysco Food Servs., Inc., 948 F. Supp. 1418, 1438 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (discussing different potential interpretations of the per se theory of liability under the ADA, all of which contemplate that "the employee could have been reasonably accommodated (without undue hardship) in a manner contrary to the [per se discriminatory] policy but was not" in order to fmd that the "employer violates the ADA" by implementing the policy); McGregor v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 187 F.3d 1113, 1116 (9th Cir. 1999) (explaining that, under the per se theory, "[a] '100% healed' . . . policy discriminates against qualified individuals with disabilities" because of the "individual assessment" it denies those "qualified individual[s]")); see also Henderson v. Ardco, Inc., 247 F.3d 645, 653 (6th Cir. (2001) ("All courts that have examined the question . . . agree that a 100% rule is impermissible as to a disabled person -- but one must first be disabled."); Contreras v. Suncast Corp., 237 F.3d 756, 766 (7th Cir. 2001); Powers v. USF Holland, Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49109, 10-11 (N.D. Ind. May 13, 2010); Stuckey v. City of Naperville, 1998 U.S. Dist.

Although the parties stipulated that Steffen was not disabled this does not necessarily foreclose Steffen's ability to pursue a per se violation of the Rehab Act. A person is afforded all the same rights and protections under the ADA and the Rehab Act whether he actually suffers from an impairment that substantially interferes with a major life activity or if he is merely regarded as suffering from such an impairment. Regardless of whether the employee is actually disabled or the employer merely regards the employee as disabled, the ADA and Rehab Act require the employer to individually assess the employee's ability to perform his job, with or without a reasonable accommodation. Any requirements that an employee be 100% healed before the employer will permit the employee to return to work conflicts with the individualized assessment required by law.
If anything, the collaborative individualized assessment is most important with respect to employees who are not actually disabled but are merely regarded as such by their employers. It is through the collaborative process that the employer will learn not only that the employee is capable of performing his job, but that because [*23]  the belief of disability is mistaken, capable of doing so without an accommodation. To preclude employees from pursuing relief for per se violations merely because they fell under the protections of the ADA and the Rehab Act through the "regarded as" prong would be inconsistent with the intention of these laws.
Therefore, although Steffen need not be able to prove that he is actually disabled in order to proceed with a claim of a per se violation of the Rehab Act, Steffen must still show that the USPS was required to engage in an individualized assessment of his ability to perform his job with or without an accommodation. Accordingly, to pursue a claim of a per se violation of the Rehab Act, Steffen must show that the USPS regarded him as an individual who suffered from an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity. As explained above, Steffen cannot make this showing, and thus his claim of a per se violation of the Rehab Act must fail.
Even if Steffen could prove that the USPS did regard him as disabled, summary judgment in favor of Steffen on this point would not be appropriate. Prior to Steffen being terminated, his supervisor prepared an "Offer of Modified Assignment [*24]  (Limited Duty)" which offered Steffen to return to work in a position that he would be able to perform with his limitations. (Docket No. 38-1.) However, there appears to be a factual dispute as to whether Steffen was ever presented with this offer; Steffen contends he never received this offer and if he had, he would have accepted it. (Docket No. 37.) If Steffen had received this document and for whatever reason declined the offer, this would suggest that irrespective of what the Agreement stated, USPS did not actually require that Steffen be 100% healed before he could return to work, and therefore there would be no per se violation of the Rehab Act.

IV. CONCLUSION
The Amendments Act was not retroactive and therefore, in order to establish a prima facie case, the plaintiff in this matter is required to present evidence that the defendant regarded the plaintiff as suffering from an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity. Although there is evidence that the defendant was well-aware of certain of the plaintiff's limitations, the plaintiff has failed to present evidence that the defendant believed these impairments substantially limited a major life activity. Therefore, the plaintiff [*25]  has failed to present a prima facie case of discrimination.
With respect to the plaintiff's claim that the defendant's requirement that he be fully recovered and able to perform his job without any limitation or accommodation constituted a per se violation of the Rehab Act, the plaintiff lacks standing to bring this claim. Because the plaintiff was not actually disabled nor regarded as suffering from an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity, the plaintiff was not protected under the Rehab Act, and thus the defendant was not required to individually assess whether the plaintiff was able to perform his job with or without a reasonable accommodation.
Finally, Steffen's complaint contained a "pattern and practice" claim. The plaintiff acknowledges that he has failed to muster proof sufficient to sustain this claim. (Docket No. 36 at 14.) Therefore, it is unnecessary for the court to consider the defendant's argument whether this claim is barred based upon an alleged failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. (Docket No. 30 at 32-34.)
For the reasons set forth above the court shall grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Docket No. 29), and deny the plaintiff's [*26]  cross-motion for partial summary judgment, (Docket No. 35.)
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, (Docket No. 35), is denied.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Docket No. 29), is granted. The Clerk shall enter judgment accordingly dismissing the plaintiffs complaint and this action.
Dated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 11th day of April, 2011.
