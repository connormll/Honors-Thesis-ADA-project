CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings: Order (1) GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 25) (IN CHAMBERS)
Before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment. ("Motion," Dkt. No. 25.) After considering the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the matter, and argument at the December 9, 2019 hearing, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the Motion.

I. BACKGROUND
On October 5, 2018, Plaintiff Sandy Santos ("Plaintiff") filed a complaint for damages for disability discrimination in employment, wrongful termination, and related claims in the San Bernardino County Superior [*2]  Court against Highland AL-MC GP, LLC ("Defendant). ("Complaint," Dkt. No. 1, Ex. A.) On November 7, 2018, Defendant removed the action to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 1.)
The Complaint contains twelve causes of action: (1) discrimination based on sex, disparate treatment, in violation of Cal. Govt. Code § 12940; (2) disability discrimination in violation of Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(a); (3) failure to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process to determine reasonable accommodation for disabilities in violation of Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(n); (4) failure to reasonably accommodate disabilities in violation of Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(m); (5) denial of pregnancy leave in violation of Cal. Govt. Code § 12945; (6) retaliation for opposing violations of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act, Cal. Govt. Code §§ 12900-12996, ("FEHA"), in violation of Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(h); (7) medical or family leave retaliation in violation of California Family Rights Act, Cal. Govt. Code § 12945.2 ("CFRA"); (8) medical or family leave discrimination in violation of the CFRA; (9) retaliation for opposing violations of FEHA, in violation of Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(h)1 ; (10) failure to prevent retaliation and discrimination in violation of Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(j), (k); (11) whistleblower retaliation in violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 1102.5, 1102.6; and (12) wrongful termination in violation of public policies, common law tort.

II. FACTS
The following material facts are sufficiently supported by admissible evidence and are uncontroverted. They are "admitted to exist without controversy" for purposes of the Motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); L.R. 56-3. The Court considers the parties' objections where necessary.2 All other objections are [*6]  OVERRULED AS MOOT.
Brightwater Senior Living of Highland3 ("Brightwater") is a senior living facility for aging adults. (King Decl. ¶ 3.) Santos was hired in July 2017 as a resident assistant ("RA") working in Brightwater's Memory Care Unit. (DSUF ¶ 1.) At the end of November 2017, she knew she was pregnant and requested an accommodation to remain on the job, but was placed on unpaid leave. By that time, she had worked about 715 hours at Brightwater. (DSUF ¶¶ 34-35; Sherman Decl. ¶ 8.)
As an RA, Santos's job responsibilities included: food service; laundry; pet care; assisting with community activities; housekeeping; and helping with residents' daily activities (bathing, dressing, using the restroom). (DSUF ¶ 2.) The RA job description demands standing walking, pushing or pulling, and grasping or manipulating. It indicates RAs spend 60-80% of their time on each of these tasks.4 (Id. ¶ 3; RA Job Description at 3.) The job description also demands lifting, transferring and supporting residents. It indicates lifting or exerting up to fifty pounds of force 20% or less, and twenty-five pounds 20% to 40%.5 (DSUF ¶ 4; RA Job Description at 3.) The job description also notes "reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals [*7]  with disabilities to perform the essential functions," and that the employer may "revise the duties . . . at its discretion." (RA Job Description at 3.)
On November 28, 2017, after approximately 4 months after starting work, Santos informed her direct supervisor, Candis Mays ("Mgr. Mays"), she was pregnant, and provided a note from her healthcare provider ("Work Status Report") , dated November 27, 2017. (DUSF ¶¶ 6, 8-9; Work Status Report I.) Mgr. Mays passed the Work Status Report to Julieanna Taylor, Brightwater's Assistant Director ("Ass. Dir. Taylor"). (DSUF ¶ 7.) The same day, Ass. Dir. Taylor and Santos met to discuss the report. (Id. ¶ 8). According to the Work Status Report, Santos was placed on modified activity at work and at home from 11/27/2017 to 4/9/2018, and her activity would be modified as follows:
• Stand: frequently (up to 75% of shift)
• Walk: frequently (up to 75% of shift)
• Bend at the waist: intermittently (up to 50% of shift)
• Torso/spine twist: intermittently (up to 50% of shift)
• Lift/carry/push/pull no more than 30 pounds
• Avoid contact with patients with chickenpox or shingles
(Work Status Report I.) Santos requested an accommodation, (Mot. at 2,) by asking Ass. [*8]  Dir. Taylor if she could fold laundry, serve residents, work in the kitchen, work at reception, clean bathrooms, or do "basically anything," to stay on the job. (DSUF ¶ 10; Santos Dep. 49:24 - 50:9.) At the same meeting, Ass. Dir. Taylor stated there was nothing available,6 (DSUF ¶ 16), and told Plaintiff she had to complete a leave request, (PSUF ¶ 12). Ass. Dir. Taylor did not tell Santos whether or not she was or would be terminated at that meeting. (DSUF ¶ 17.) At that time, Santos believed one resident had shingles.7 (DUSF ¶ 12.) Defendants do not attach evidence regarding the prevalence of shingles among Brightwater residents or in the population generally, nor do they include information about how shingles is transmitted.
On November 30, 2017, Teri Sherman, the senior accountant who also handled HR ("Sr. Accountant Sherman"), sent Santos a letter explaining: "Due to the nature of your duties we are not able to provide a modified work schedule, so your time off will be classified as California Pregnancy Disability Leave for the first 4 months ending on March 27th, 2018. On March 28, 2018, your leave will move to a Leave of Absence from that point to April 9th, 2018." (DSUF ¶ 18.) [*9]  Sr. Accountant Sherman also spoke with Santos by phone and informed her that "when she was ready to come back to work that she would most likely be hired back." (PSUF ¶ 22.)
The Parties do not dispute that Santos was placed on leave in late November 2017 and did not return to work on April 9, 2018. (DSUF ¶ 19.) They disagree whether she thought she could return, whether she was informed she was terminated prior to the conclusion of her leave, and whether she effectively abandoned her job. (PSGD Reply ¶ 19.) The Court finds these are material questions of fact for which summary judgement is not appropriate on this record.8 On April 18, 2018, Brightwater executed a separation notice. (PSUF ¶ 35.) Santos began working at Brightwater again in March 2019, following this lawsuit. (DSUF ¶ 20.) She performed well, and Brightwater was happy that she was back. (King Decl., ¶ 13; Taylor Decl., ¶ 17.) On October 31, 2019 she resigned. (King Decl. ¶ 13.)
The following facts are relevant to Santos's whistleblower and retaliation claims. After Santos's conversation with Ass. Dir. Taylor, Santos complained to Mgr. Mays regarding the failure to accommodate. Mgr. Mays told Plaintiff perhaps her not [*10]  being allowed to work at Brightwater was "God's plan" showing her that she needed to take care of her unborn child.9 (PSUF ¶¶ 16-17.) In early December 2017, Santos filed a government agency complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), but did not tell anyone at Brightwater about the complaint. (DSUF ¶¶ 28-30.)
Finally, Santos provides evidence of a comparator RA: a non-pregnant woman who hurt her back and was permitted to continue working, but who may or may not have had a shingles contact limitation.10 (DSUF ¶ 23.) The parties disagree whether an accommodation other than unpaid leave was available in Santos's case.

III. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden of informing the district court of the basis for its motion and identifying the portions of the pleadings and record that it believes demonstrate the absence of an issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). Where the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need not produce evidence negating or disproving every essential [*11]  element of the non-moving party's case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Instead, the moving party need only prove there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Id.; In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010). The party seeking summary judgment must show that "under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986).
If the moving party has sustained its burden, the non-moving party must then show that there is a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. A genuine issue of material fact exists "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. "This burden is not a light one. The non-moving party must show more than the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d at 387 (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252). The non-moving party must make this showing on all matters placed at issue by the motion as to which it has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
When deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir. 1991). Thus, summary judgment for the moving party is proper when a "rational trier of fact" would not be able to find for the non-moving party based on the record taken as a whole. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).

IV. DISCUSSION [*12] 

A. Discrimination on the Basis of Sex (Disparate Treatment 11 ) (First Cause of Action) and Disability (Second Cause of Action)
Plaintiff asserts two claims for wrongful termination based on discrimination due to her membership in two protected classes. The first cause of action alleges Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because of her sex, and the second because of her disability. (Compl. ¶¶ 42-45, 46-51.) FEHA outlaws employment discrimination based on sex and physical disability. Cal. Govt. Code § 12945(a).
"California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination . . . ." Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354 (2000). This framework applies to wrongful termination claims based on sex and disability discrimination. See generally id.; Sandell v. Taylor—Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297 (2010); Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125 (2003). Under this framework:
A plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its employment decision. Then, in order to prevail, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer's alleged reason for the adverse employment decision [*13]  is a pretext for another motive which is discriminatory.
Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994) (citation omitted); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973); Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 68-69 (2000).
Here, however, "the burden is reversed . . . because the defendant who seeks summary judgment bears the initial burden" in an employment discrimination action. Dep't of Fair Employment & Hous. v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011) (interpreting FEHA) (quotations and citations omitted); Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 224 (1999). In other words, the defendant bears the initial burden to "show either that (1) plaintiff [can]not establish one of the elements of the FEHA claim or (2) there [is] a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions." Dep't of Fair Employment & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations and quotations omitted).
With regard to the first means of discharging a defendant's burden, disparate treatment claims require evidence of intentional discrimination, which often leads to an "elusive" factual inquiry. As a result, "the plaintiff need produce very little evidence of discriminatory motive to raise a genuine issue of fact." Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1141 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Mustafa v. Clark County Sch. Dist., 157 F.3d 1169, 1180 (9th Cir. 1998)).
With regard to a defendant's second means of discharging its burden, "[L]egitimate reasons are reasons that are facially unrelated to prohibited bias, and which, if true, would thus preclude a finding of discrimination." Reeves v. MV Transp., Inc., 186 Cal. App. 4th 666, 673 (2010) (quotations omitted and emphasis in original). Assuming a defendant's initial burden is met because [*14]  of the existence of a legitimate reason, "the employee must then 'offer substantial evidence that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual, or evidence the employer acted with a discriminatory animus, or a combination of the two, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer engaged in intentional discrimination.'" Id. (quoting Hersant v. Department of Social Services, 57 Cal. App. 4th 997, 1004-05 (1997)).

1. Prima Facie Case
To make a prima facie showing of sex discrimination, Plaintiff must:
provide evidence that (1) [s]he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive.
Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 355 (2000).
Here, there is no dispute that Plaintiff's pregnancy was a qualifying disability, that she presented Brightwater with a doctor's note stating her limitations, that she excelled at her job, or that she requested an accommodation. (Mot. at 8.) Rather, the motion hinges on (1) whether Santos suffered an "adverse action,"12 (2) whether a reasonable accommodation was denied, [*15]  and (3) whether some circumstance suggests motive.
The Court tackles the first two questions together. Under FEHA, an employer's decision to place an employee on leave when she is able to work with another reasonable accommodation "cannot be described as a lawful accommodation of a physical disability." Ravel v. Hewlett-Packard Enter., Inc., 228 F. Supp. 3d 1086, 1096 (E.D. Cal. 2017) (citation omitted); see also Ravel v. Hewlett-Packard Enter., Inc., 228 F. Supp. 3d 1086, 1093 n.1 (E.D. Cal. 2017) (noting that if the accommodation offered by defendant is not "reasonable," defendant's denial of plaintiff's request would constitute an "adverse employment action.") Thus, forcing a pregnant employee to take unpaid leave when a reasonable paid accommodation is available can qualify as adverse action.13 Whether the decision to place Santos on leave was an adverse action therefore depends on whether she was able to perform paid work with a reasonable accommodation.14
The Court concludes there is a triable issue as to whether Santos could have worked with a reasonable accommodation. Another employee was provided accommodations when she injured her back, and presumably, could not lift heavy objects. (DSUF ¶ 23.) And the Court is not persuaded by Defendant's strained interpretation of the Work Status Report's instruction regarding shingles. [*16]  It is not obvious that the doctor imposed complete ban on Santos entering facilities where persons with shingles may be. The note only states Santos should "avoid contact" with such persons. Supra note 7. Plaintiff also raises an issue as to whether other positions were available, and suggested plausible duty modifications within her job description such as folding clean laundry and working in the kitchen. As a result, Plaintiff establishes the denial of a reasonable accommodation, and by extension, the adverse action element.
In the alternative, Plaintiff provides evidence of adverse action by raising a triable issue as to her termination. See discussion supra note 8. A reasonable jury could reach different conclusions as to whether Ass. Dir. Taylor, Mgr. May, or others, stated she was terminated in late November 2017 or on the March 26, 2018 call, or stated she did not need to submit an updated Work Status Report. Although the Motion insists that in early April, before the end of Santos's leave, Brightwater "assured" Santos she could come back, (PSGD Reply ¶ 19), the declarations on this point equivocate. Being welcomed back or hired back is not the same as not having been terminated. [*17]  The evidence leaves room for doubt as to whether Santos's impression she had been terminated was correct, and if not, whether it was corrected before April 9, 2018, the date her leave expired, and by which she would have had to submit the second Work Status Report extending the leave period.
As to the third question, whether "some other circumstance" suggests discriminatory motive, the Court emphasizes that an "employee need only offer sufficient circumstantial evidence to give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination." McInteer v. Ashley Distribution Servs., Ltd., 40 F. Supp. 3d 1269, 1281 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (citation omitted). Plaintiff points to two such circumstances: first, the close proximity—less than a day—between her notification of pregnancy and the forced leave, see Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 334 (2008) ("[T]emporal proximity, by itself, may be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination . . ."), and second, the comments by Mgr. Mays that the forced leave was part of God's plan. Reasonable jurors could disagree whether Mgr. Mays' statement was benign, but at this stage, the circumstances surrounding the forced leave are sufficient to establish a prima facie case that Santos was subjected to adverse employment action because of her pregnancy.

2. Legitimate Non-Discriminatory [*18]  Reasons
Once a FEHA plaintiff demonstrates a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the employee's discharge. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. The defendant must make a "sufficient showing of a legitimate reason for discharge." King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 433, (2007). The defendant's "burden is one of production, not persuasion, thereby involving no credibility assessment." See Day v. Sears Holdings Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1169 (C.D. Cal. 2013).
With regard to the forced leave, Defendant leans principally on the argument that it was impossible for Santos to work, consistent with her doctor's orders regarding shingles exposure, anywhere within the facility. The Court concludes a jury could find the stated reason legitimate but pretextual, and could reject it as an insufficient justification.15 Plaintiff could establish pretext by arguing Defendant unreasonably sought to use that Work Status Report to foreclose any and all work within the facility. (Opp'n at 18.)
The Court turns next to the debate over whether Santos abandoned her job or instead was led to believe she had been terminated. Defendant asserts that Santos was separated after her leave period ended, on April 9, 2018, because she decided not to come back to work. Defendant therefore denies [*19]  the premise by arguing the alleged termination did not happen until after Plaintiff's leave had expired and she failed to return to work, at which time termination was entirely appropriate. (Mot. at 13.) Plaintiff counters that she was told on a March 26, 2018 call that she "no longer worked here," (Opp'n at 9), and thereby raises a genuine dispute.
Thus, the availability of an accommodation, and the fact as well as the "legitimacy" of the termination hinge on triable questions. For these reasons, the Court DENIES the Motion as to the first and second causes of action.

B. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process (Third Cause of Action) and Failure to Accommodate Disability (Fourth Cause of Action)
Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to make reasonable accommodations for Plaintiff and failed to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA. Section 12940(m) provides that it is unlawful "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee." The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the [*20]  essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability. Scotch v. Art Institute of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10 (2009).
Under FEHA, it is also unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for accommodation by an employee . . . ." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). In order to state a prima facie case for failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process, a plaintiff must also demonstrate that she "tender[ed] a specific request for a necessary accommodation." King v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 443 (2007) (quoting Spitzer v. Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1384 (2000)).
Here, the parties agree Plaintiff had a qualifying disability, was qualified for the job, and made a request, (Mot. at 8), but dispute whether Plaintiff has established Brightwater's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff raises a triable issue on this question, for reasons discussed in the preceding section.
Plaintiff has also submitted evidence Defendant failed to engage in a good faith and interactive process to determine the effectiveness of reasonable accommodations. Defendant could have, but did not, seek clarification from Santos's medical provider regarding [*21]  the Shingles restriction. And the meeting at which Plaintiff tendered her request to fold laundry or to be tasked with lighter work within her essential responsibilities was the same meeting at which her request was denied and a which she was instructed to fill out leave paperwork. A jury could conclude that the request and the denial occurred at the same meeting. With regard to the alleged early termination, as already discussed, triable issues abound. The record is open to multiple readings on the question of whether there was a "breakdown" in communication regarding Santos's return to work in April and May, and with whom responsibility ultimately lies. Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 62 n.22 (2006).
As a result, the Motion is DENIED as to the third and fourth causes of action.

C. Retaliation and Whistleblower Retaliation Claims (Sixth, Ninth, and Eleventh Causes of Action)
Under FEHA § 12940(h), an employer may not discriminate against any person because "the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(h). "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under [] FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he or she engaged in a protected [*22]  activity, (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1020 (internal quotation omitted).
The Court agrees with Defendant, (Mot. at 17-19), that Plaintiff's claim falters at the third element. Plaintiff did not tell anyone at Brightwater about the EEOC charge. By the time the charge was filed in December 2017, she had already been placed on leave, (DUSF ¶¶ 28-30), and it is unclear what connection, if any, the charge had with subsequent conversations with Ass. Dir. Taylor or Sr. Accountant Sherman three months later, in March, April, or May 2018. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED as to the Sixth, Ninth, and Eleventh causes of action.

D. Failure to Prevent Retaliation and Discrimination (Tenth Cause of Action)
A failure to prevent claim requires evidence of a "fail[ure] to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(k). "A plaintiff seeking to recover on a failure to prevent discrimination claim under FEHA must show that (1) [he] was subjected to discrimination; (2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination; [*23]  and (3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 804 (N.D. Cal. 2015). Courts have interpreted "a failure to prevent discrimination claim [to be] essentially derivative of a [FEHA] discrimination claim." Id.
Defendant's arguments in favor of dismissing Plaintiff's FEHA claims are unavailing. By extension, the Court DENIES Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's claim premised on Defendant's failure to prevent. Plaintiff raises triable issues regarding Brightwater supervisors' awareness of how to properly address pregnancy leave requests. Defendant argues that Santos was aware of Defendant's antidiscrimination policies, acknowledged them, and understood that they applied to her. (Mot. at 21.) However, the focus of the inquiry is on whether Defendant, not Santos, took "all reasonable steps" to prevent discrimination. The Court DENIES the Motion as to the tenth cause of action.

E. Medical or Family Leave Retaliation (Seventh Cause of Action) and Discrimination (Eighth Cause of Action)
Defendant Argues that the seventh and eight causes of action, which are grounded in the CFRA, fail, because Plaintiff was not eligible. (Mot. at 19.) To be eligible for CFRA, an employee must work [*24]  for a qualifying employer for more than 12 months, and have at least 1,250 hours of service to that employer during the previous year. Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(a). Plaintiff does not dispute she worked less than 1,250 hours, (DSUF ¶¶ 34-35), and does not oppose summary judgment as to these claims. (Opp'n at 9 n.3.) Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Motion as to the seventh and eighth causes of action.

F. Denial of Pregnancy Leave (Fifth Cause of Action)
In her Fifth claim, Santos alleges that Brightwater violated the Pregnancy Disability Leave Law ("PDLL"). The PDLL is a law contained within the broader provisions of FEHA that provides certain protections to female employees with pregnancy-related disabilities. See Cal. Govt. Code § 12945. Under section 12945(a)(1) of the PDLL, an employer must allow "a female employee disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition to take a leave for a reasonable period of time not to exceed four months and thereafter return to work." Cal. Govt. Code § 12945(a)(1).
The Court has already determined that material issues remain as to whether Defendant terminated Plaintiff during her PDLL leave, which would have ended on March 28, 2018, four months after Plaintiff requested leave. Santos states Ass. Dir. Taylor told her on a March 26, 2018 phone [*25]  call she no longer worked there and did not need to provide the updated Work Status Report. (PSUF ¶ 29.) Ass. Dir. Taylor does not recall this conversation. (PSUF Reply ¶ 29; Taylor Decl.) Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the Court concludes Defendant has not met its burden to show an absence of evidence, and DENIES the Motion as to the Fifth cause of action.

G. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy (Twelfth Cause of Action)
In California, an "employer may not discharge an at will employee for a reason that violates fundamental public policy. This exception is enforced through tort law by permitting the discharged employee to assert against the employer a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of fundamental public policy." Stevenson v. Superior Court, 16 Cal. 4th 880, 887 (1997). FEHA's prohibition against disability discrimination may form the basis of a wrongful discharge in violation of public policy claim. See City of Moorpark v. Superior Court, 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1159-61 (1998).
Because Plaintiff's FEHA discrimination claim survives summary judgment, her claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy also survives. The Court DENIES the Motion as to the twelfth cause of action.

H. Punitive Damages
Each of Plaintiff's causes of [*26]  action is based on state statutes and/or doctrines, so the availability of punitive damages here is a question of state law. Central Office Tel. v. AT&T Co., 108 F.3d 981, 993 (9th Cir. 1997), rev'd on other grounds, 524 U.S. 214, 228 (1998). Under California law, punitive damages may be appropriate "where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294. Punitive damages are recoverable for FEHA violations. Yeager v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 944 F. Supp. 2d 913, 931 (E.D. Cal. 2013); Commodore Home Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court, 32 Cal. 3d 211, 220, 221. Under FEHA, "[if] Defendant is a corporation, the evidence must demonstrate an officer, director or managing agent of Defendant committed, authorized or ratified an act of malice, oppression or fraud to create a genuine issue of material fact on punitive damages." Yeager, 944 F. Supp. 2d at 931.
A review of the record indicates that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that managing agents of Brightwater, namely Ass. Dir. Taylor, Sr. Accountant Brightwater, or Mgr. Mays committed, authorized, or ratified the decision to require Plaintiff to take a leave of absence or to terminate Plaintiff. Because Plaintiff's FEHA claim for disability discrimination survives summary judgment, the Court finds it would be premature to dismiss her request for punitive damages. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion as to punitive damages. [*27] 

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Motion is GRANTED as to the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and eleventh causes of action, and DENIED as to the remaining causes of action.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
