REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is currently before the Court on the defendant's motion to compel or, in the alternative, to dismiss for want of prosecution under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b); also before the Court is the plaintiff's motion to extend the discovery cutoff. For the reasons explained below, the Court denies the latter motion, and recommends that the district judge grant the motion to dismiss.

Background & Procedural History
On October 1, 2011, Delores Ammons-Lewis ("Plaintiff")  [*2] filed this lawsuit against her employer, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District ("MWRD" or "Defendant"), alleging sex discrimination, race discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII, violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, violation of the Family Medical Leave Act, and violation of 42 U.S.C. §1983. The MWRD moved to dismiss portions of the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), and, on May 17, 2012, Judge Feinerman, the district judge to whom the case is assigned, granted that motion; specifically, he dismissed Ms. Ammons-Lewis' ADA claim; her FMLA claims, to the extent they turn on alleged wrongful conduct occurring before October 1, 2008; her §1983 claims, to the extent they turn on alleged wrongful conduct occurring before October 1, 2009; and her Title VII claims, to the extent they turn on alleged wrongful conduct occurring before March 24, 2007. Consistent with the Court's scheduling order, the MWRD filed an answer to the remainder of the complaint on June 6, 2012.
Judge Feinerman, who had earlier entered a scheduling order providing for a fact discovery cutoff date of August 31, 2012, referred the case to this Court for discovery supervision. The defendant  [*3] was first to serve written discovery: on May 24, 2012, consistent with the scheduling order, the MWRD served its first request for production of documents (attached hereto as Exhibit 1) and its first set of interrogatories (attached hereto as Exhibit 2). Ms. Ammons-Lewis did not respond to the MWRD's discovery requests. Shortly after the deadlines spelled out in Rules 33(b)(2) and 34(b)(2)(A) passed, counsel for the MWRD began contacting counsel for Ms. Ammons-Lewis to find out when the MWRD could expect to receiver responses to its written discovery. And thus began the dance number that has led to this recommendation, with counsel for Ms. Ammons-Lewis repeatedly promising to provide responses by a date certain, only to have that date come and go without a word. Counsel for Ms. Ammons-Lewis even represented to the Court, at a status on July 20, 2012, that he would provide discovery responses no later than July 23rd; he provided nothing. Thus, on July 25, 2012 - with the fact discovery cut-off just over a month away - counsel for the MWRD filed a motion to compel (docket #39).
On August 1, 2012, counsel for the MWRD appeared on his motion to compel; plaintiff's counsel failed to appear,  [*4] but left a message for the Court stating that he "did not object" to the motion. The Court granted the motion, and ordered the plaintiff to respond to discovery within seven days; the Court also ordered Ms. Ammons-Lewis to reimburse the defendant for the costs of bringing the motion. See Transcript of Proceedings from August 1, 2012 (docket #69).
The case was set for status August 10, which was supposed to have been after discovery was turned over. On August 8, 2012, counsel for the plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider, seeking to vacate that portion of the August 1st order requiring plaintiff to pay the MWRD its costs of bringing the motion to compel (docket #46); counsel also requested an extension of time - to August 10th - to submit responses to the defendant's outstanding discovery requests. At the hearing on August 10th, which was counsel's latest, self-imposed, deadline for submitting responses, the Court learned that the plaintiff's responses still had not been turned over. Counsel requested yet another extension - this time until August 13th - and the Court, reluctantly, granted his request. Exasperated by counsel's failures to produce discovery responses, the Court noted  [*5] that the case had been pending for almost a year, that nothing had been done on the case, and that the parties were butting up against the August 31 discovery cutoff. The Court observed that there appeared to have been a lot of "foot dragging" on the plaintiff's part. Nonetheless, because counsel for the MWRD was in-house and not required to pay his own expenses, the Court reconsidered its sanctions award, ordered counsel for the plaintiff to turn over all discovery responses by Monday, August 13th and set another status to ensure compliance. See Transcript of Proceedings from August 10, 2012 (docket #68).
On August 22, 2012, counsel for the MWRD filed another motion to compel and noticed it up for August 27, 2012 (docket #51). When the parties appeared on that date, it became clear that the plaintiff still had not responded to the defendant's discovery requests - which had, by that time, been outstanding for almost three months. The plaintiff had turned over no documents, and, in lieu of a response to interrogatories, had provided a 100+ page narrative that was not even signed. Plaintiff's counsel offered the same feeble excuses, admitted that the interrogatory responses he had provided  [*6] were not signed and that his answers "needed shaping" - he admitted, in other words, that his discovery responses were woefully deficient under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. After reiterating that plaintiff's failure to comply with the very basic discovery rules was dragging the case out unnecessarily, the Court ordered the plaintiff to comply with all discovery requests that day, ordered the parties to return two days later and advised counsel to inform his client that she was in danger of having her case dismissed for want of prosecution. See Transcript of Proceedings from August 27, 2012 (docket #70).
On August 29th, the parties appeared again; at that time, counsel for the MWRD advised the Court that the plaintiff had not served discovery responses on August 27th, as she had been ordered by the Court to do. Counsel for the MWRD conceded that, upon walking into court that morning, he had been provided with a stack of documents, but he represented that he still had not received a written response to the MWRD's document requests. Counsel also represented that he had received from Ms. Ammons-Lewis (on August 29th - not August 27th) a revised response to the interrogatories;  [*7] he noted, however, that, at least at first blush, it looked to be very similar to the original version (that is, a long narrative that did not seem particularly responsive to the interrogatories propounded). The Court set a status date two weeks out to give the plaintiff and her attorney one last chance to comply with the discovery requests and reiterated, once again, that the case was potentially subject to dismissal for want of prosecution. See Transcript of Proceedings from August 29, 2012 (docket #71).
At the next status, on September 12, 2012, the Court learned that the MWRD still had not received responses to its outstanding discovery. Counsel for the MWRD advised the Court that he had reviewed the earlier submission from Ms. Ammons-Lewis and communicated by letter the deficiencies with respect to both the response to the request for production of documents and the answers to interrogatories, and that he had requested revised responses in advance of the September 12th status hearing; he received nothing. He also indicated that, despite Ms. Ammons-Lewis' representation that she and her attorney had thousands of documents to go through, he had only received from her about 300 pages  [*8] of documents. Counsel then advised the Court that, in its view, the case should be dismissed for want of prosecution and made an oral motion to that effect.
In response, counsel for Ms. Ammons-Lewis advised the Court that he had, in fact, prepared a revised response to the interrogatories that, in his view, complied with the discovery rules. He had not yet served it on the MWRD, however. Counsel for the MWRD also advised the Court that, although it had received a stack of documents from the plaintiff, he had not received a response to the MWRD's requests to produce documents or anything indicating which documents were responsive to which requests.
Also at the September 12 hearing, the Court learned that, although the discovery deadline had now passed, the plaintiff had served no discovery requests of her own. Counsel advised the Court that he planned to file a motion to extend the discovery deadline. The Court advised counsel to hand over copies of everything so that it could see for itself whether the plaintiff had, in fact, complied with discovery or if what she had done amounted to more foot dragging. The Court advised the parties that if plaintiff's discovery responses were still  [*9] deficient, it would recommend dismissal of the case. See Transcript of Proceedings from September 12, 2012 (docket #72).

Discussion
As explained, the case is currently before the Court on the defendant's motion to compel, or, in the alternative to dismiss for want of prosecution. Also before the Court is the plaintiff's motion to extend the discovery cutoff date. Turning to the latter first, the motion is denied. Ms. Ammons-Lewis did not serve a single discovery request during the first year this case was pending, and she offered no legitimate reason for failing to pursue discovery from the MWRD. The Court can see no point in prolonging the defendant's pain; past experience suggests that she would do nothing with the additional time allotted her anyway.
Turning to the MWRD's motion, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) provides that, "[i]f the plaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it." Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b). "Dismissal for want of prosecution 'is an extraordinarily harsh sanction that should be used only in extreme situations, when there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct,  [*10] or where other less drastic sanctions have proven unavailing.'" Kasalo v. Harris & Harris, Ltd., 656 F.3d 557, 561 (7th Cir. 2011)(quoting Gabriel v. Hamlin, 514 F.3d 734, 736 (7th Cir. 2008)). "The appropriateness of this measure depends on all the circumstances of the case." Kasalo, 656 F.3d at 561 (citing National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, 427 U.S. 639, 641-42, 96 S. Ct. 2778, 49 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1976); Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 633, 82 S. Ct. 1386, 8 L. Ed. 2d 734 (1962)). Factors relevant to the decision include "the frequency of the plaintiff's failure to comply with deadlines; whether the responsibility for mistakes is attributable to the plaintiff herself or to the plaintiff's lawyer; the effect of the mistakes on the judge's calendar; the prejudice that the delay caused to the defendant; the merit of the suit; and the consequences of dismissal for the social objectives that the litigation represents." Kasalo, 656 F.3d at 561 (citing Aura Lamp & Lighting Inc. v. International Trading Corp., 325 F.3d 903, 908 (7th Cir. 2003); Ball v. City of Chicago, 2 F.3d 752, 755 (7th Cir. 1993)).
Initially, the Court notes that it has previously granted a motion to compel discovery from the plaintiff - and even ordered the plaintiff  [*11] to pay the defendant's expenses for having to bring the motion. Yet Ms. Ammons-Lewis still refused to provide discovery responses. And her attorney - despite the threat of sanctions - has failed to heed the Court's admonition to take control of this case; after failing to meet the deadlines imposed by the rules and then the Court, he ultimately provided discovery responses that simply do not conform to the rules of practice and procedure. At this point, the Court has no reason to believe that a sanction short of dismissal would jumpstart the diligent prosecution of this case. Indeed, dismissal is warranted here because Ms. Ammons-Lewis has initiated no discovery of her own, she has behaved in a manner that has stalled and obstructed the defendant's attempts to obtain discovery, and she has persistently declined to obey this Court's orders concerning discovery. Her repeated refusal to provide the defendant with the written discovery it seeks is particular prejudicial in this case, given Judge Feinerman's order on the motion to dismiss; because he carved out timetables for the remaining claims, information concerning the alleged incidents and events constituting the alleged discrimination  [*12] is of vital importance. Yet a year into the case, the defendant still has no way of knowing whether any of Ms. Ammons-Lewis' claims are viable or whether she is able to offer any evidence to support her claims.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33 provides for discovery via written interrogatories; the rule requires a responding party to answer each interrogatory "separately and fully in writing under oath." Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(3). The MWRD's discovery requests include 8 separately numbered interrogatories seeking targeted information concerning Ms. Ammons-Lewis' claims. Interrogatory number 1 simply asks the name or names of the individuals providing responsive information. Interrogatories 2 through 6 ask the plaintiff to "identify each event, incident or other occurrence" that forms the basis of her claims (number 2 asks for information relating to her sex discrimination claim; number 3, her race discrimination claim; number 4, her retaliation claim; number 5, her FMLA claim; and number 6, her §1983 claim). Each interrogatory also seeks some very basic information about the claims - names, dates, specifics of communication, treatment, etc. Interrogatory 7 seeks information relating  [*13] to damages, and interrogatory number 8 asks the plaintiff to identify any documents used in the preparation of the responses. As this brief summary should make clear, these are not complicated or extraordinary requests.
And yet, the document served in response to these interrogatories is a 100-page, single spaced rambling diatribe, which seems to have been set down stream-of-consciousness style by the plaintiff, without any polishing, synthesizing or input by or from her attorney. The "answers" include statements of argument and summaries of documents without reference to claims or allegations, and, though lengthy, they fail to provide the information requested in any coherent shape or form, if at all.
To illustrate, the MWRD's interrogatory number 4 asked Ms. Ammons-Lewis to "identify each event, incident, or other occurrence, numbering each one separately that forms the basis of your retaliation claim in this lawsuit." It also asked her to specify, for each such event, incident or occurrence, a) the statutorily protected activity she engaged in; b) the date she engaged in such activity; c) the date of each event, incident or occurrence of retaliation; d) the location where the retaliation  [*14] occurred; e) the method of communication; f) the names of people who witnessed or participated in each incident; g) specifics about what was said, written and/or done; h) the names of the people committing the retaliatory acts; i) all facts and evidence that demonstrates the retaliation; j) how the MWRD treated her less favorably than employees who did not engage in statutorily protected activity; and k) how the conditions of her employment were altered as a result of the retaliatory acts identified.
Ms. Ammons-Lewis' response to this interrogatory consists of an introductory paragraph, followed by nine separately numbered paragraphs, and another unnumbered paragraph, as follows:

ANSWER
Retaliatory conduct the defendant and its Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisor listed in plaintiff's answer #1 did against plaintiff for complaining and reporting their unlawful conduct from June 2007 through to January 20, 2011.
1. After Plaintiff complained and file an inside and out discrimination complaint with the defendant's Calumet Plant Supervisors and plant Managers and their Human Resource Department from June 2007 through to December 2007, the defendant's retaliation started as cited above and  [*15] below in plaintiff's answers.
2. After plaintiff filed an inside Discrimination Complaint with the defendant's EEO Complaint Investigator Suzanne Boswik on July 20, 2007, the defendant's retaliation started, as cited below by each incident, date and place.
3. After Plaintiff filed her original IDHR/EEOC Charge of Discrimination outside of Charge #440-2008-01513 on December 18, 2007, crossed filed on January 18, 2008 by the EEOC, the defendant's retaliation and harassment got ugly as cited below by each incident and date, and place.

6. After plaintiff filed another amended her charge of discrimination 440-2010-00001 on October 7, 2009 and reincorporated retaliation and sex, the defendant's retaliatory conduct went pass breaking the law, as is cited below by  [*16] each incident, dates and places.
7. After Plaintiff filed her amended EEOC Charge#440-2010-00001 on March 26, 2010, that included sex, race, retaliation and a denial of disability, the defendant's Retaliatory conduct got severe, as cited below by each incident, date and place.
8. After plaintiff complained to her supervisors and human resources concerning the harassment and otherwise unlawful conduct that she was subjected to in the workplace from June 2007 through to June 2010, the District engaged in more retaliatory conduct against her as stated below:
9. The retaliatory conduct included, but is not limited to the following: (a) plaintiff's denial of job related trainings and training materials; January 2008 to June 2010 (b) plaintiff's repeated denial of computer email access and computer password; 2002 through to September 2011 (c) denial of Operating Engineer 2 upgrade pay; September 2009 through to June 20, 2010 (d) denial of (OT) overtime pay; October 2009 through to June 2010 (e) unwarranted low performance evaluations; 2009 and 2010(f) plaintiff's unwarranted defamation of character and suspension; February 2010 through to January 2011 (g) plaintiff's repeated denials of duty  [*17] disability benefits under the worker's compensation act; 2001, 2007, 2009 and 2010 and 2011 (h) the refusal to allow plaintiff to return to work in a timely fashion with light duty restrictions; 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2012 (i) the refusal to allow plaintiff family and medical leave benefits; twice in 2007 and once in 2010 (j) the refusal to accommodate plaintiff's already demonstrated allergy to Polymer C-9450, February 2010 through to December 2010 and (k) the refusal to grant plaintiff's earned vacation benefits, 2002 through to 2012 and (l) the refusal to provide plaintiff protection in the work place 2001 and 2010 (m) refusal to provide plaintiff witness protection in the work place; 2002, 2008, 2009, 2010 (n) unfair and unjust investigations; 2001, 2002, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012 (o) denial of grievance process and procedures; 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and (p) denial of the Weingarten rights; 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 (q) denial of the accident and reporting policies and procedures; 2001, 2002, 2007, (r) denial to work in a non-hostile work environment; (s) denial of medical treatment 2001, 2002, June 2007 through to the present 2012; (s) denial of the HIPPA Rights 2002,  [*18] 2003, 2009, 2010 and 2011; (t) defendant's repeated alterations of plaintiff's accident reports and the accident site's where plaintiff got injured; 2001, 2007, 2010, and 2012 (u) alterations of the defendant's FMLA Policy to deny plaintiff FMLA benefits for herself and for her child Adult, 2007 and 2010, (v) Defendant's FMLA Coordinator defaming plaintiff to a stranger, when saying to the female UIC Sickle Cell Social Worker in 2010, the reason plaintiff's was denied FMLA benefits to care for her daughter is because the defendant don't like plaintiff in 2010; (w) denial of restoration of plaintiff's wrongly taken employee benefits of FMLA, sick time, holiday time, and vacation, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 through to the present 2012; (x) denial of Safety Interview, regarding work accidents, 2002, 2007, and 2012; (y) denial of respect in the work place 2007 through to the present 2012; (z) denial of FMLA benefits because of plaintiff's adult child's disability 2010. On repeated occasions, plaintiff have been retaliated against for making complaints and reporting the unlawful and discriminatory policies and conduct of the defendant. The various adverse employment actions noted  [*19] above that were taken by the District against Plaintiff from June 2007 through to May 2012 were motivated, in part, by the District's intent to retaliate against plaintiff for reporting the unlawful conduct. Additionally after plaintiff suffered work related injuries, with witnesses, in December 2001, June 2007 and May 2012, plaintiff was not permitted to return to work in 2002, 2003, and 2007 and May 2012, even though she was released with light duty restrictions) by her doctor and the Company's doctor, and was capable of performing the job duties relating to her position. All retaliation occurred at the Calumet Plaint in section 834 at 400 East 130th, in Chicago, Illinois and at the Defendant's Human Resources Department and their Law Department at 100 East Erie, Chicago Illinois.
The following persons knew of it, took part in it and approved it from 2007 through to 2011:
Calumet Plant Head, Thomas Conway, Plant Manager Brian Perkovich, Chief Operating Engineer, Paul Wysocki, Assistant Chief Operating Engineer's Allen Nichols, Raymond Bonzani and Calumet Safety Inspector's former lead inspector, Ernest Deleon, Tim Dilotherwit and Richard Jefferies. The MWRDGC Human Resource Department's  [*20] former Director of HR, Assistant Director's Frances Wilkins, Denice Korcal, Thaddues Kosowski, Roxanne Bonner, Richard Layon, Marju Sharma, Osoth Jamjum,. Claims department, Sandra Belford, Vincent Mathe, and Eric Walton. The District's Law Department Attorneys, Fredrick Feldman, James B. Murray, Lisa Goldburg.
Revised Response, pp. 87-89 (attached hereto as Exhibit 3).
During discovery, the parties are supposed to disclose all relevant information, so that the resolution of disputed issues may be based on a full and accurate understanding of the facts and, ultimately, produce a fair and just result. E.g., United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S. Ct. 983, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1077 (1958); Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 500-01, 67 S. Ct. 385, 91 L. Ed. 451 (1947). Responses that are argumentative, riddled with opinions and irrelevant information - even if they contain kernels here and there of information that may be responsive - do not serve this purpose. "Lawyers are supposed to winnow and sift." Haff v. Cooke, 923 F.Supp. 1104, 1107 (E.D. Wis. 1996). There was neither winnowing nor sifting here; counsel clearly just took his client's diatribe and attempted to pass it off as a response to discovery. And, significantly, this  [*21] is the revised response -the response served after plaintiff and her attorney supposedly "shaped" it.
Quite simply, the plaintiff's answers to interrogatories, even in their revised form, are neither appropriate nor acceptable and offer little or nothing helpful to a defendant trying to defend itself against this lawsuit. The response does both too much and too little: it offers way too much in the way of a narrative, yet offers almost nothing in the way of information that might assist the defendant in preparing a defense of this case. Such conduct might be expected - might even be excusable - from a pro se plaintiff; Ms. Ammons-Lewis is represented by counsel.
What's more, the Court warned both Ms. Ammons-Lewis and her attorney - on several occasions - that their foot dragging and persistent failure to comply with discovery rules and deadlines, even after numerous extensions, would have consequences, including the very real possibility that the case could be dismissed for want of prosecution. Additionally, after plaintiff finally served her long overdue response, the Court told her and her attorney that the format was unacceptable and even advised them both how the answer should be  [*22] prepared consistent with the rules governing discovery. They did little to change the response and nothing to bring it into compliance with the discovery rules. The Court has been incredibly patient with Ms. Ammons-Lewis and her attorney, giving them many attempts to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and even spoon-feeding them the proper format for their responses. Yet even these extraordinary measures have failed to solve the problem. Most disturbing to the Court, Ms. Ammons-Lewis and her attorney still believe that their revised answers to interrogatories comport with the rules of procedure. They quite clearly do not.
Ms. Ammons-Lewis' conduct with regard to the MWRD's requests for production of documents was no better. Rule 34 requires that, within 30 days of service, the responding party must, for each item or category requested, provide a written response. Although the plaintiff did, finally, turn over some documents to the MWRD at the last status hearing (well over two months past the deadline), she has - to this day - still not served a response to the defendant's document requests, despite being ordered by the Court to do so.
Finally, Ms. Ammons-Lewis has served  [*23] no written discovery of her own, despite the fact that the case has been pending for almost a year and despite the fact that fact discovery closed more than a month ago. Quite simply, Ms. Ammons-Lewis has done nothing to prosecute her case. Counsel has made excuse after excuse, but taken no steps to advance the ball and done nothing to bring his client into compliance with the Court's orders. Having given Ms. Ammons-Lewis and her attorney every benefit of the doubt and ample opportunity to set things right, the Court is now compelled to follow through with its threatened sanction: the Court recommends that the district judge dismiss this case for want of prosecution.

Conclusion
For the reasons explained above, the Court denies the plaintiff's motion for an extension of fact discovery and recommends that the district judge dismiss this case for want of prosecution under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b).

PLAINTIFF'S ANSWERS TO MWRD'S FIRST SET OF INTERROGATORIES
Plaintiff Delores Ammons-Lewis hereby answers Defendant's First Set of Interrogatories as Follow:

GENERAL OBJECTIONS
1. Plaintiff objects to identifying which witnesses she will call at trial until the pre-trial order is filed.
2. Plaintiff objects to defendant's Interrogatories because they are unduly burdensome and overly broad and call for legal argument and are seeking some information in a form that is better obtained by deposition, at the close of discovery, in response to dispositive motions or at trial. Plaintiff will answer the Interrogatories subject to these objections.
3. Plaintiff objects to defendant's Interrogatories because, with subsections constituting separate inquiries, that constitute 120 interrogatories and far exceed the number permitted by applicable Federal Rules.

ANSWER :
1. Plaintiff have been denied Job related trainings and other employee benefits, freely granted to her male co-worker's, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's similarly situated to plaintiff from January 2008 through to June 2010:
The defendant Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors listed, gave notice of their job related trainings to only their new and senior, black and white male employees titled operating Engineer 1's and 2's, and they approved for them to take  [*76] over 59 different job related trainings from January 2006 through to June 2010. The trainings were announced by the defendant's Calumet plant Managers Thomas Conway, Brian Perkovich, and the Calumet Supervisor('s), former Chief Paul Wysocki, both Assistant Chief's Allen Nichols and Raymond Bonzani, via face to face meetings, private work mail boxes, private phone calls and the male operating Engineer 1's and 2's computerized private e-mail accounts. The Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors also for the male operating Engineer 1's and 2's, to take the job related trainings and classes, and receive the different types of reference materials and training certificates, hat's, donuts, and other items for participating in the mandatory job related trainings from January 2008 through June 2010. The black and white MWRDGC male employees titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2'are similarly situated to plaintiff, Delores Ammons-Lewis, the only Afro-American female Operating Engineer 1. See the defendant's exhibit pages 56 to 172 and Plaintiff's Exhibit # 00107 to 00223 ) and pages, 56, 77, and 81 for the defendant's different types of job related trainings and attendance sign in sheets of pages  [*77] 56 to 172. The defendant's own training documents, e-mail notices and attendance sign in sheets list the names of each male employee, titled (Operating Engineer 1's and 2's who did receive notification of the job related trainings via their private e-mail accounts, of when and where the trainings would take place, all listed on the defendant's training and attendance sign in sheets. These were mandatory job related trainings that deal directly with plaintiff's job duties on a daily basis, but plaintiff was denied notification of the trainings via a private computer and e-mail account like her male co-workers, Operating Engineer 1's and 2's and denied to take over forty of the trainings. Plaintiff is the only Afro-American Female Operating Engineer 1 who did not have a private e-mail account to receive notification or communication about the defendant's different type of mandatory job related trainings that her new and senior, black and white male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, received from January 2008 through to June 2010, who are similarly situated to Plaintiff, who is assigned to do the same job duties as her male co-workers at the same locations of the Calumet  [*78] Plant in section 834, on all three shifts, if plaintiff had to do a double or was called in early before her shift of afternoons on days, plaintiff carried the same job classification as her male co-worker's Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, whereby only the male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's received notice of the defendant's mandatory job related trainings and were approved to take the trainings shown on the Defendant's training and attendance sign in sheets of pages 56 to 172 by their own hand written signatures, but plaintiff was denied the same rights as follow below.
1. Identify each event, incident, or occurrence, numbering each one separately, that forms the basis of your sex discrimination claim in this lawsuit. For each such event, incident, or occurrence, specify : a) the date it occurred; b) the location where it occurred; e) the method of communication ( e.g., by phone, by letter, or in person; d) the name of each person who was present or participated at the time; e) what was said, written, and/or done that was discriminatory ; f) the name of each person who committed the discriminatory acts; g) all facts and evidence you have that demonstrate this was sex discrimination;  [*79] h) how (if at all) the MWRD treated similarly situated employees (identifying them by name and title) more favorably than Plaintiff; and i) how if applicable, the conditions of employment were altered as a result of any discriminatory acts you identify.
Plaintiff had to answer the race and sex and discrimination claims, separately and sometimes plaintiff answers about the Race claim, involved sex discrimination to, and this is because some of the defendant's denial of job related trainings to plaintiff, involved both, a sex and race claims together, but plaintiff have separated the one's that clearly involved Sex only discrimination, when answering both interrogatory questions of # 2 about Sex and # 3 about Race. All addresses and phone numbers of each person plaintiff list by name, can be found in plaintiff's FRCP 26 (a) disclosures.

The defendant's Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisor's listed, only gave notice to the new and senior white male employees titled Operating Engineer 1's, Harry Caliban, Martin Depas and Charles Gariepy, who all are similarly situated to plaintiff in job assignment and job duties, plant location and section 834, same Chicago Stationary Operating Engineer's license, and represented by the same union Local 399, and supervised by the same plant managers and supervisors listed in plaintiff answer #1, and another fact, plaintiff have worked at the Tarp Pumping station location two days a week, since January 19, 1998 through to June 2010, plaintiff was not notified of this job related training or was she allowed to take the job related training given to her new and senior white male co-worker's titled Operating Engineer 1's of the same job classification as plaintiff an Operating Engineer 1 and this is discrimination. See the Defendant's training and attendance sign in sheet Exhibit pages 57 to 59 and (Plaintiff Exhibit #'s 00108 to 00110).

The problem with the supervisor's Ray Bonzani's e-mail is, its dated July 14, 2010 for what one would not assume an e-mail dated July 14, 2010 would be for a April 7, 2010 job related training, which would have been impossible for plaintiff's shift supervisor to get this message in the e-mail to plaintiff for the April 7, elevator training at the Tarp Pumping Station, because the e-mail  [*83] was three months old, and after the training had already taken place. The following new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's listed above did received advance notice via their private e-mail accounts about the job related trainings, but plaintiff was denied and this is discrimination.

On and about September 21, 2009 through to September 25, 2009, the defendant's Plant Managers and Supervisor's listed in plaintiff's answer #1 gave notification to the following new and senior black and white Male Operating Engineer 1's Adam Fisher, Dennis O'Rourke, Brian Donohue, and Operating Engineer 2's Charles Jones and John Cunnane of the afternoon shift via their private e-mail accounts, so they would be able to take the CBF trainings, and Plaintiff was denied notification and the right to take the CBF trainings, even though she had been working the afternoon shift since January 18, 1998 and her new male co-worker's had not made their probation or civil service status like plaintiff the only Female Operating Engineer 1 working on the afternoon shift during the time period stated on the defendant's exhibit 102 and ( plaintiff EX.00153) for the afternoon shift employees of Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, but plaintiff was denied both,  [*100] notification via a private e-mail and the right to take the CBF trainings with her male co-workers titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's of the afternoon. See the defendant's Exhibit page 102,that definitely forms the basis of plaintiff's Sex Discrimination claim in this lawsuit. The defendant's exhibit page 102 (plaintiff ex. # 00153) Training Course : MWRDGC CBF OPERATIONS, dated 9/21/09 to 9/25/09 is for the afternoon shift- week # 2, it show the following new and senior, black and white Operating Engineer 1's Adam Fisher, Dennis O'Rourke, Brian Donohue, and Operating Engineer 2's Charles Jones and John Cunnane, all did received notification of the CBF training via their private e-mail accounts and did take the CBF trainings, that consisted of four (4) days of training and all were similarly situated to Plaintiff, who also worked on the Afternoon shift, with the exception that plaintiff had worked on the afternoon shift since January 18, 1998 through to June 20, 2010, and did and was doing the same duties as her male co-worker's listed above, of new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's and some of the male Operating Engineer 1's didn't work on the afternoon shift  [*101] like plaintiff, but was allowed to take the CBF trainings on the afternoon shift and plaintiff was denied. Plaintiff was denied notification of the CBF trainings via a private e-mail account, and any written notice of the CBF trainings even though she worked the afternoon shift and worked during the time periods the CBF trainings were being held at the Calumet Plant. See the defense's page 102, and(Plaintiff Ex. #00153). Plaintiff was also denied the right to take the CBF training on the day shift of the defenses page 99 and (plaintiff #00150) with the other male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's from September 14, 2009 to September 18, 2009, even though the Defendant's Assistant Director Denice Korcal write a 3 page letter dated October 8, 2009, Plaintiff EX. 00693 to 00695) responding to plaintiff's September 24, 2009, 3 page discrimination complaint - Pl. ex. #00690 to 00692 ) whereby plaintiff request answers why she couldn't take the CBF trainings from the defendant's EEO complaint's investigator Suzanne Boswik ? This was before plaintiff learned only in July 2012 she was supposed to be given the CBF trainings just like her new and senior, black and white male co-workers titled,  [*102] Operating Engineer 1's and 2's. ? The defendant's Assistant Director Korcal responds to plaintiff's request in her 3 page October 8, 2009 letter( Plaintiff Ex. #'s 00693 to 00695)-saying, the reason plaintiff didn't get the CBF training is, she couldn't leave the Digester's station unmanned while her shift supervisor Charles Jones attended the CBF trainings and that plaintiff will get the training from those that took the trainings. The defendant's Assistant Director Korcal wrote another 1 page mean spirited letter dated October 27, 2009, (PL. EX. 00701), wrongly accusing plaintiff of doing wrong, when plaintiff only followed her directions stated in her October 8, 2009 letter of contacting the Calumet plant Manager Brian Perkovich. Plaintiff have never received the CBF trainings from anybody, be it the defendant's Plant Managers or Supervisor or any Operating Engineer 1 or 2 that took the CBF trainings from September 14, 2009 through to the present September 2012 or did plaintiff receive a memory stick with the CBF trainings information on it or did plaintiff receive a CBF training certificate for completion of the CBF trainings course, like her new and senior, black and white male  [*103] co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and Operating Engineer 2's who are similarly situated to plaintiff, who did receive the items mentioned as a result of them being notified of the CBF trainings and allowed to take the CBF trainings. Plaintiff have not received the CBF trainings for over 3 years now. This forms the basis of plaintiff's Sex Discrimination claim in this lawsuit.
"Sex Discrimination "
25. On and about September 28, 2009 through to October 2, 2009 the defendant's Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1 gave notification to the following new and senior black and white male Operating Engineer 1's, Brian Donohue, Joe Gudio, Brian Pokrewczynski, Kenneth Bernatek, Willie Davis, Charles Gariepy, and Martin Depas and Operating Engineer 2's, Fran Blake, John Cunnane, and Kent Anderson of the midnight shift via their private e-mail accounts about the defendants CBF trainings, but plaintiff was denied, on all three shifts, including the afternoon shift that she had worked on since January 18, 1998.
The defendant's exhibit page 103 and (plaintiff Ex. #00154) CBF Trainings/ Attendance sheet dated 9/28/09 to 10/2/09 for the third shift, show the following  [*104] new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's, Brian Donohue, Joe Gudio, Brian Pokrewczynski, Kenneth Bernatek, Willie Davis, Charles(Chuck) Gariepy, and Martin Depas, Kenneth Bernatek, of the midnight shift did all received notification of the CBF Trainings and were allowed to take the CBF Trainings and all are similarly situated to plaintiff, the only Female Operating Engineer 1 District wide that did/do the exact same duties as all of her male co-workers listed above, but plaintiff was denied. The following new and senior white male Operating Engineer 2's named Fran Blake, John Malone, and John Cunnane, all work on different shifts, but were allowed to take the CBF trainings on which ever shift they chose to, regardless of the shift they worked on or were working on during the times the trainings were being held from September 14, 2009 through October 16, 2009, but plaintiff was denied, all are similarly situated to Plaintiff, the only Afro-American Female Operating Engineer 1 who do the same duties and worked at the same Calumet plant location and section 834, and was and still is supervised by the same plant managers and supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, but plaintiff  [*105] was denied. The defendant allowed several white male Operating Engineer's 2's, an example is plaintiff's afternoon shift supervisor, Operating Engineer 2, John Cunnane who work with plaintiff on the afternoon shift, was allowed to take the CBF Trainings on the midnight shift.
See the Defendant's exhibit page 103 and (pl. Ex. # 00154) CBF Training/attendance sheets for the midnight shift Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that said at the bottom of the page the last day of the CBF trainings for the midnight shift was September 29, 2009. Plaintiff was at work during all of the CBF training on all three shifts, but was still denied the right to take the CBF trainings back in September and October 2009 through to the present September 2012. This forms the basis of plaintiff's Sex Discrimination claim in this lawsuit.
26. The defendant's CBF training exhibit pages 104 to 114, (Plaintiff Ex. 00155 to 00165) involved management and other departments and did not involve any Operating Engineer 1's or 2's.

" Sex Discrimination "
27. On and about October 16, 2009 the defendant's Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1 gave notification to the following Indian male Operating  [*106] Engineer 1, Brian DeSousa, and white male Operating Engineer 2, Fran Blak about the defendant's CBF trainings via their private e-mail accounts and allowed them to take the CBF trainings along with management at their session, but plaintiff was denied. See the defendants exhibit pages 103 and (Plaintiff Ex. 00154) and the defendant's exhibit page 115 and (Plaintiff's #00166) that clearly show the Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors allowed the male Operating Engineer 1 and Operating Engineer 2 to take the CBF trainings on any shift they selected, but plaintiff was denied. This forms the basis of plaintiff's Sex Discrimination claim in this lawsuit. The Defendant's Exhibit page 115 (pl. Ex.#00166) show that Operating Engineer 1 Brian DeSousa and Operating Engineer 2, Fran Blake took the CBF Training titled CBF Maintenance — Fire Suppression on October 16, 2009 along with management, but plaintiff was denied to any of the CBF trainings on any shift and with anybody and denied notification of the CBF Trainings via a private e-mail account she could take it on all three shifts from September 14, 2009 through to October 16, 2009 and was denied the right to take the CBF trainings that  [*107] officially started on September 14, 2009 with the day shift (1st shift) and on September 21, 2009 of the afternoon shift with her shift supervisor Charles Jones at the Digester's, when defendant Assistant Chief Allen Nichols instructed plaintiff's Supervisor Charles Jones, Operating Engineer 2 to go take the CBF training in the presence of Operating Engineer 2 Thomas Scannell and Operating Engineer 1, plaintiff, Ammons-Lewis in the Digester's office on the afternoon shift. Plaintiff asked her supervisor Allen Nichols, if all Operating Engineer 1's and 2's would receive the CBF trainings on September 14, 2009 and he replied yes to plaintiff, in the presence of her afternoon shift supervisor Charles Jones, and the day shift supervisor Operating Engineer 2, Tom Scannell, in the Digester's office at the Calumet plant. Plaintiff never saw or had any knowledge there were any MWRDGC( defendant's) Calumet Plant CBF training documents that actually stated all three shifts of Operating Engineer 1's and 2's were entitle to be notified of the CBF trainings and allowed to take the CBF trainings, because the defendant's Assistant Director Denice Korcal stated in her October 8, 2009 letter as if  [*108] plaintiff was not entitle to take the CBF trainings or receive any training materials or a certificate, she said the reason plaintiff didn't get the CBF trainings is she couldn't leave the Digester's work station unmanned while her supervisor was gone to the CBF trainings and that plaintiff would receive the training from those who took the trainings, which is contrary to what the defendant's exhibit page 98 and (plaintiff EX. 00149) say, of the fact that all three shifts of Operating Engineer 1 and 2's were supposed to get the CBF trainings on their shift, and one would think, it goes without saying, if plaintiff worked on the afternoon shift she would have received the CBF trainings on the afternoon shift with the new and senior, black and white male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, but plaintiff was repeatedly denied. The defendant's own Attorney James B. Murray knew plaintiff worked on the afternoon shift and reviewed the 3 page letter that the defendant's Assistant Director Denice Korcal sent to plaintiff, but never did he say to the EEOC investigator Engram or anyone else, that the defendant's Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisor's clearly discriminated against  [*109] plaintiff when they denied her the same rights as her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's to take the defendant's CBF trainings in 2009, the defendant's Attorney James B. Murray knew that discrimination had taken place against plaintiff with the defendant's CBF trainings given the male employees titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's in September and October 2009 before he sent the trainings documents that pertained to it, with his position statements dated July 23, 2010 to the EEOC investigator Engram. The defendant's Attorney James B. Murray didn't send a copy of the defendant's Assistant Director Korcal's October 8, 2009 CBF trainings denial letter that was sent to plaintiff with his position statement and training documents in July 2010, because it would clearly showed plaintiff was discriminated against in Sex. The fact that the defendant and its plant Managers and Supervisors and Human Resource staff and its law Department all discriminated against plaintiff in its CBF trainings and other job related trainings, and denied it in the July 23, 2010 position statements, their Attorney Murray sent to the EEOC investigator Engram. The fact that the defendant only  [*110] allowed the male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's to know about the CBF trainings and take them, but deny plaintiff is blatant Sex discrimination .
Plaintiff did report what her male supervisor Allen Nichols said that, she would not be receiving the CBF trainings on September 21, 2009 and that she would be working both jobs of an Operating Engineer 1 and Operating Engineer 2 for the same pay of an Operating Engineer 1 to the defendant's former Calumet Plant Supervisor/ Chief Operating Engineer of section 834 of M & O, Mr. Paul Wysocki on or about September 23, 2009, because he was both plaintiff and Mr. Nichols boss. The former Chief Operating Engineer Paul Wysocki said to plaintiff he told you right. Plaintiff asked the Chief Paul Wysocki on September 23, 2009, why she wouldn't be receiving the CBF Trainings and the new and senior black and white male operating Engineer 1's and 2's would ? The Chief replied to plaintiff, because you won't be going down there. Plaintiff asked, why are the white male Operating Engineer 1's James Boyzk of days, Dennis O'Rourke of the afternoon shift and Brian Pokrewczynski of the midnight shift at the Tarp Pumping Station where she had worked since 1998,  [*111] being allowed to take the CBF trainings? The Chief replied, in case he needed to shut down Tarp and bring one of them over there, they would know how to operate the new Boiler facility. Plaintiff's afternoon shift Supervisor Charles Jones begged the Assistant Chief Allen Nichols on September 21, 2009 over and over again to let plaintiff take the CBF trainings first and he told him no. The Operating Engineer 2, Charles Jones and Tom Scannell asked the Supervisor /Assistant Chief Operating Engineer Allen Nichols the question of who will be operating the new Calumet Boiler Facility on September 14, 2009 ? The Supervisor Nichols said the Operating Engineer 2's, and then they asked who will be doing the duties of the Operating Engineer 2 at the Digester's ? The Assistant Chief/Supervisor Nichols said the Operating Engineer 1's. Then plaintiff asked are you saying the Operating Engineer 1's are going to do two jobs for the price of one ? The Supervisor Nichols responded to plaintiff and said are you saying you can't do your job ? Plaintiff replied no, I am not saying I can't do my job, the Local 399 CBA says that an Operating Engineer 1 can't do both jobs for the salary of an Operating Engineer  [*112] 1 and if she was made to do both duties, she would file a grievance about it. Plaintiff told her afternoon shift supervisor Charles Jones and the Union Steward Tom Scannell, both Operating Engineer 2's and supervisors of their shift, that the District is discriminating against her (plaintiff) by denying her the CBF trainings and letting only male employees, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's to take the CBF trainings on September 21, 2009 in the Digester's office at the Calumet Plant. Plaintiff told the Chief Operating Engineer Paul Wysocki on or about September 23, 2009 that him and the Assistant Chief Operating Engineer Allen Nichols were discriminating against her and asked him (Paul) for a MWRDGC discrimination complaint.
The former supervisor and Chief Operating Engineer Paul said, he don't have any discrimination forms and would have to call downtown to get one and he would call plaintiff back. The chief did call plaintiff back and say the defendant's EEO Complaint investigator, Suzanne Boswik said plaintiff needed to call her. Plaintiff did call (Suzanne Boswik) on or about September 23, 2009 and informed her that her supervisor's listed in plaintiff's answer #1, Nichols and  [*113] Wysocki ware discriminating against her in training and wages at the Calumet Plant. The following persons denied plaintiff notification of the CBF Trainings and the right to take the CBF trainings at the defendant's Calumet Plant of section 834, Assistant Chief Operating Engineer Allen Nichols on 9/21/09, plaintiff's former Calumet plant, Chief Operating Engineer Paul Wysocki on 9/23/09 and the defendant's Human Resource former Director Patrick Foley, and the new Assistant Director/ new Director, Denise Korcal in her letter of October 8, 2009(pl. #00693 to 00695) and her 1 page letter dated October 27, 2009-(pl Ex. #00701) and the defendant's EEO Complaint investigator Suzanne Boswik and the defendant's Attorney James B. Murray from September 2009, through to the present 2012. See the Plaintiff's Calumet Plant's copy pages from the different station log book pages (pl. ex. #00371 to 00389) of September 2009 that show the new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's were allowed to leave their work stations unmanned at the different Calumet Plant's work stations, as the Digester's, Tarp Pumping Station, the Centrifuge, Pump and Blower Floor and New Blower Building and the Central  [*114] Control main office location, on all three shifts to receive the CBF Trainings, that Plaintiff the only Afro-American female Operating Engineer 1 District wide and similarly situated to her new and senior black and white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, were denied, on all three shifts. See the Defendant's CBF Trainings exhibit pages 99, 102, 103, 104 and 115 from September 14, 2009 through to October 16, 2009, that the defendant's own Attorney James B. Murray sent to the EEOC Investigator Kimberely Engram on July 23, 2010, along with his 3 page position statements responding to plaintiff's amended discrimination charge #440-2010-00001 and the EEOC investigator's June 24, 2010 documents request, that clearly show the Defendant intentionally denied Plaintiff, the only Afro-American female Operating Engineer 1 the CBF job related trainings and other job related benefits, granted her male co-workers as a result of them taking the CBF trainings, that only the new and senior, white and black male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, received via a notice sent to their private e-mail accounts about taking the CBF trainings, but plaintiff was denied. I believe, as plaintiff this forms the  [*115] basis of plaintiff's Sex Discrimination claim in this lawsuit.
The Defendant's Calumet plant Managers, Thomas Conway, and Brian Perkovich, and the Calumet Plant Supervisor of section 834, Paul Wysocki, Allen Nichols and Raymond Bonzani did notify the new and senior, black and white male operating Engineer 1's and 2's about the CBF trainings and did approved for them to leave their work stations unmanned to take the CBF trainings, and intentionally denied plaintiff who is similarly situated to her male co-worker's, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's to receive the job related trainings and benefits for over three years now. Plaintiff's white male supervisor John Cunnane who work on the afternoon shift with her and cited in the Defendant's Exhibit page 103, was allowed to take CBF training on the midnight shift and Operating Engineer 1 Brian DeSousa and Operating Engineer Fran Blake were allowed to take the CBF trainings with management on the defendant's exhibit page 115, but plaintiff Delores Ammons-Lewis the only female Operating Engineer 1 was denied to take the CBF trainings at all. Plaintiff and the male Operating Engineer 2's Jones and Scannell were all told all Operating Engineer  [*116] 1's and 2's would receive the CBF trainings on September 14, 2009 by the defendant's Calumet Plant Supervisor/ Assistant Chief Operating Engineer Allen Nichols, in the Digester's office on the afternoon shift. See Plaintiff's Exhibit #00371 to 00389 ) copies of the Defendant's different Station log book pages that show new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's wrote in their log book, gone to the CBF trainings/ gone to boiler training, and left their stations unmanned, but plaintiff was denied to leave her's and her partner, Operating Engineer 2 Charles Jones work stations unmanned on September 21, 2009, while he attended the CBF training and she was denied to leave any of her work stations unmanned from September 22, 2009 through to October 16, 2009 during the periods the CBF trainings were being held to receive the CBF Trainings, all of the male Operating Engineer 1's wrote in their log books gone to the boiler training, and got the approval from the Calumet Plant managers and supervisor's listed in plaintiff answer #1, to do so, but plaintiff was denied and this is discrimination. See the Defendant's CBF Trainings and Attendance sign in sheets Exhibit pages 99, 102, 103 and  [*117] 115 training dates that match the Calumet Plant's different station log book pages, where the new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's similarly situated to Plaintiff did leave their work stations unmanned to receive the defendant's new CBF Trainings in September and October 2009. The Station log books are reviewed by the Calumet plant Supervisors Nichols, Bonzani and Wysocki daily, who allowed only the new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's on all three shift's to write in their different station log books they were gone to the boiler trainings without any relief, and to just leave their stations to run by themselves, because these were mandatory job related trainings, that they must take, but plaintiff was intentionally denied the same benefits as her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's to take the CBF trainings on all three shift's and this is discrimination. The Calumet Plant's Supervisor's and Manager's Thomas Conway, Brian Perkovich, and Chief Operating Engineer Paul Wysocki, and two Assistant Chief Operating Engineers Allen Nichols and Raymond Bonzani, and the defendant's Executive Directors, Richard Lanyon, and Kevin Fitzpartrick and their  [*118] Human Resource, former Director Patrick Foley and Assistant Director Denice Korcal, and the Defendant's Complaint's investigator Suzanne Boswick and the defendant's Law Department Attorney James B. Murray all knew and approved for plaintiff to be denied the CBF trainings, and training certificate and future reference materials that all of the new and senior, black and white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's similarly situated to plaintiff in class title, job duties, work location and section 834, covered by the same union Local 399, and sign in the same station books in section 834 of the Calumet Plant like plaintiff, and for these reasons stated, this is discrimination and, this form the basis of plaintiff's SEX DISCRIMINATION CLAIM IN THIS LAWSUIT.
Plaintiff is the only female Afro-American Operating Engineer 1 working for the MWRDGC from January 18, 1998 through to the present 2012 that was denied the same training benefits granted to her new and senior, black and white male co-worker's OE 1's and OE2's, of notification of the defendant's CBF Trainings held from January 2008 through to June 2010, and the right to take them, that was granted to her male co-worker's titled Operating  [*119] Engineer 1's and 2's, who are similarly situated to plaintiff.
Plaintiff's paragraph #27 continues of the defendant's intentional denial of the CBF Trainings from September 2009 through to the present 2012, of three years later :
The following new and senior, black and white male Operating Engineer 1's Jim Boyzk, Jim Elbaor, Dan McNicholas, Joe Gudio, Adam Fisher, Dennis O'Rourke, Brian Donohue, Charles Gariepy, Earl Eber, Harry Caliban, Daniel Manning, Kenneth Bernatek, Martin Depas, Gerald Batchler, Gary Andreas, Brian Pokrewczynski, Mark Vosburg, Willie Davis, and James Mielee and Brian Desousa, all did received notice of the Defendant's CBF trainings via their private e-mail accounts and did take the CBF trainings to receive the future referencing material/ flash drive stick with all of the CBF trainings on it, a training certificate for completion the CBF trainings, and an advantage over plaintiff when it came to taking the promotional Operating Engineer 2 examination in August 2012, a huge salary increase, a guaranteed to future growth and or a promotion one day to the Operating Engineer 2 position at the Calumet Boiler Facility, and the OE2 upgrade in pay, whenever asked to work  [*120] up as an Operating Engineer 2 at the new Calumet Boiler Facility, but plaintiff was denied and this is discrimination in Sex.
All of the new and senior, black and white male Operating Engineer 1's, that carry the same job titled as plaintiff, as an Operating Engineer 1, have a benefited from taking the CBF Trainings in 2009, in pay, knowledge, an extra advantage in taking the Operating Engineer 2 Promotional Exam, and received an increase in their yearly salary since they took the CBF trainings in September and October 2009, all listed in the defendant's exhibit pages 99, 100, 101, 102, and 103, 104 and 115 from September 2009 through to the present, but plaintiff have been denied from September 2009 through to the present September 2012 any of the benefits and this is discrimination. The following new and senior white male operating Engineer 1's Daniel Manning, Dan McNicholas, Harry Caliban, Paul Sullivan, Gerald Batchler, Charles Gariepy, Gary Andreas, and Adam Fisher, all received the guarantee to 02 pay and a future promotion, when the defendant allowed them to take the CBF trainings in 2009. They have all earned the Operating Engineer 2 pay increase, since working at the Calumet  [*121] Boiler Facility from October 2009 to the present September 2012, when called to work there and have received an advantage over plaintiff in operating the station and have earned their chance of actually receiving the Operating Engineer 2 position permanent one day, as a result of them taking defendant's recent promotional Operating Engineer 2 examination held in August 2012, but plaintiff have been denied those guarantees by defendant's Calumet Managers and Plant Supervisors and their Human Resource Department and Law Department and this is discrimination, by all intentionally denying plaintiff the same rights and benefits granted to her male co-workers titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, to training, wages, knowledge, promotion, future growth, by them receiving the Calumet Plant Boiler Facility Training. The male Operating Engineer's listed above have worked and received the Operating Engineer 2 pay since they received the CBF Trainings in September and October 2009 through to the present September 2012, which is a great benefit, that plaintiff have been denied, all have already received the knowledge and theory of how the boiler facility operate, when they took the training and  [*122] get more and more knowledge each time they are allowed to work the position, but plaintiff have been denied the same benefits for over three years now and this is discrimination. They all have received the difference in an Operating 1 and Operating Engineer 2 pay when they worked at the New Calumet Boiler facility, which there is a difference in pay and a higher yearly income earned, while working under the title of an Operating Engineer 1, same as plaintiff, but she was also denied that, See Plaintiff's Ex. 00558 to 00595 for the 2005 - 2008 CBA and Plaintiff's 00596 to 00634 for the 2008- 2011 CBA between the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago and Local 399 Union Collective Bargain Agreements at pages 3 of section 4 and page 6 of section 6, titled Overtime for Operating Engineer 1's and 2's like Plaintiff Delores Ammons-Lewis, the only female Operating Engineer 1 District wide that was repeatedly denied the different types of mandatory job related trainings and training benefits, and salary and overtime pay granted freely to her male co-workers, who are similarly situated plaintiff, titled new and senior, black and white male Operating Engineer 1's listed  [*123] above. This forms the basis of plaintiff's Sex Discrimination claim in this lawsuit. The following new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's Harry Caliban, Gerald Batchler, Martin Depas, Daniel Manning, Dan McNicholas, Joe Gudio, Brian Donohue, Adam Fisher, Charles Gareipy, Earl Ebers, and the newest white male Operating Engineer 1, Paul Sullivan who was hired in 2011, have received the CBF trainings, and have work at the Calumet Boiler Facility and have received the OE 2 upgrade in pay, the new white male Operating Engineer 1's have less seniority on the job than plaintiff, who had over 15 years seniority on the job, but is always denied equal training and other benefits given to the new and senior white male Operating Engineer's 1's and 2's and this is discrimination. All have worked at the Calumet Boiler Facility and received the Operating Engineer 2 pay as a result of them taking the CBF trainings, but plaintiff have been denied.
THE CALUMET PLANT NEW BOLIER FACILITY
The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District broke ground and construction of the new Calumet boiler facility (CBF) in or around 2007 and officially announced its opening in July 2009 or a little before amongst  [*124] the Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors, according to what is stated in the Defendant's exhibit page 98 announcement letter about the CBF trainings to start in September 2009 and be given on all three shifts. The new boiler Facility was built with both, a male and female washroom facility. The defendant intentionally did not allow plaintiff the same opportunity as her male co-worker's, new and senior, black or white, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's similarly situated to plaintiff, the only female Operating Engineer 1 District wide to know in advance via a private e-mail account or in writing about their CBF trainings. The new Calumet Boiler Facility (CBF) is connected to the Defendant's newer Digester's building located at the Calumet Plant at 400 East 130th Street, Chicago Illinois 60628. The notice was given to the Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1 on or about July 15, 2009, which came before July 23, 2010, new the Calumet Plant New Boiler Facility was opening, and there would be trainings for all new and senior, black and white, Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, but that the Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors only sent via the private  [*125] e-mail accounts and private mailboxes and work phones and by word of mouth to the male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's only, they would be receiving the new Calumet Boiler Facility (CBF)Trainings and Training Materials, but denied plaintiff the only Afro-American female Operating Engineer 1, District wide those same rights and benefits. Plaintiff Delores Ammons-Lewis heard it via a conversation that the Assistant Chief Operating Engineer Allen Nichols was having with the day shift white male Operating Engineer 2, Thomas Scannell and the afternoon shift Afro-American Male Operating Engineer 2, Charles Jones about the CBF trainings to be held at the new Calumet Boiler facility on or about September 14, 2009 in the old Digester's main office on the afternoon shift that plaintiff Ammons-Lewis was working on this particular day and it is then the defendant's Supervisor Nichols stated all Operating Engineer 1's and 2's would receive the CBF trainings.
28. The Defendant's exhibit page 116 and (Plaintiff Ex. 00167), 93 -232- 2M - O and M Training dated March 19, 2010 through June 24, 2010 is a defendant's training document plaintiff only received in July 2012 from the EEOC under their FOIA,  [*126] that was provided to them by the defendant's Attorney James B. Murray, plaintiff never saw it period.

56. The defendant's exhibit pages  [*140] 56 to 172 show 29 different examples of Sex and Race Discrimination that plaintiff had to encounter at the hands of the Calumet Plant manager's and Supervisor's listed in Plaintiff's answer #1 of the Defendant's mandatory job related trainings from January 2008 through to June 2010 that form the basis of plaintiff's Sex and Race discrimination claims in this lawsuit, the unequal training documents were provided by the defendant's own Attorney James B. Murray on July 23, 2010 to the EEOC investigator Kimberley Engram. Plaintiff cite the following paragraphs to her answers that constitute Race discrimination as well as sex discrimination as follow : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,11,12,14,15,,17,19,30, 32, 33,34,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,45,47,49,50,52 and plaintiff cite the following paragraph's of 21, 22, 24, 25 and 27 of plaintiff's answers constitute her Sex Discrimination claims of denial in job related trainings. Plaintiff was denied notification of the defendant's job related trainings and the right to take the job related trainings that were directly related to plaintiff's daily job assignments and duties, that the defendant's plant Managers and Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, freely  [*141] gave notification to the male operating Engineer 1's and 2's about the defendant's job related trainings via their private e-mail accounts so they could receive the trainings and benefits, but denied plaintiff.
The defendant's new and senior, black and white male employees, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that were working at the Calumet Plant during the periods of January 2008 through to June 2010, were always treated more favorably than plaintiff. The defendant's Plant Managers and Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, make sure only the male employees, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's received notification of their job related trainings via their private e-mail accounts, and made sure they did take the trainings and receive the training certificates and training materials for completing the job related trainings, and make sure all the male employees titled Operating Engineer 1's did/have received the OT/Overtime pay and the Operating Engineer 2 upgrade in pay when/while working at the new Calumet plant boiler facility from October 2009 through to the present 2012, as a result of receiving the job related training, and made sure each received future growth and promotional  [*142] opportunities to receive the position permanent, while plaintiff was intentionally denied the same employee benefit as her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and Operating Engineer 2's. The defendant intentionally interfered with plaintiffs rights to receive notification of the job related trainings, by repeatedly denying her a private e-mail account and computer access from 2007 through to 2011, training materials, future growth, over time pay, and the Operating Engineer 2 upgrade pay and an increase in her yearly salary, if she had been granted the right to take the CBF trainings and allowed to work at the new Calumet Boiler Facility—CBF, like her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's. The defendant's plant managers and supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, denied plaintiff's right to knowledge, future promotions and or transfers, and all advantages of taking the Promotional Operating Engineer 2 Exam given in August 2012 and her right to receive the acting pay as an Operating Engineer 2, and an increase in pay and the common mandatory obligations under the law, to equal treatment and equal rights in the work place as to receive job related trainings. The  [*143] Defendant denied plaintiff notices of all of their the job related trainings via a private e-mail account, regardless of what shift plaintiff worked on or what duties plaintiff did and do, regardless of plaintiff's seniority, class, race or sex. The defendant communicated with the following new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's 1's, Harry Caliban, Gerald Batchler, Dan McNichols, Joe Guido, Brian Donohue, Daniel Manning, Martin Depas, Gary Andreas, Charles Gariepy, Dennis O'Rourke, and Earl Ebers and James Elbaor, about the CBF training via their private e-mail accounts, so all could take the CBF Trainings and worked up as an acting Operating Engineer 2's at the new Calumet Boiler Facility and as a result of them receiving the CBF trainings and training reference materials, they all have received the OE2 upgrade pay for working as an acting Operating Engineer 2 from October 2009 through to the present 2012, but plaintiff have been denied from September 2009 to through the present 2012, the same benefits as her male co-workers received of the defendant's employees job related training benefits. Plaintiff lost out on the opportunity to receive the same knowledge learned as  [*144] her male co-worker's OE1's and OE2's and the OE 2 upgrade in pay and future growth from 2009 to 2012, and the possibility of working at the Calumet Boiler Facility and the possibility to one day obtain a permanent position as an Operating Engineer 2 at the Calumet Boiler Facility, had the defendant's Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, not denied plaintiff the same right given to her male co-workers, to simply take the CBF trainings and received the CBF training study materials and a completion certificate for completing the CBF training course, like her male co-worker's Operating Engineer 1's and 2's who did received notification of the training course and were allowed to leave their work stations unmanned take the CBF trainings in 2009 on any shift, that plaintiff was denied. All of this and the other things mentioned have caused serious emotional and financial harm to plaintiff, each time she see her new and senior white male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's receiving wages and benefits that she know she is entitle to, but are denied, and her plant managers and supervisors going out of their way to deprive her of the same benefits given  [*145] the male employees, that affect her living and her finances, and her future growth with the employer, is very stressful to say the least, especially when plaintiff is a good worker, and is always trying to prove that she is qualified to do her job in a professional manner every day and plaintiff knew she was a qualified Operating Engineer 1 working on the afternoon shift, that was made to lose out on the CBF trainings and the increase in pay and boiler knowledge for over three years now, it has been some very embarrassing moments, when plaintiff has to explain to her new white male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's why she is being treated differently than them, that it's because of her race and sex and her speaking out about the defendant's unlawful actions, is why she denied the same benefits given her new and senior white male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's that have always been treated more favorably than plaintiff. Plaintiff included the defendant's own exhibit page 178, list of Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, that the defendant allege had computer e-mail/internet accounts from 2008 through 2010 and the defendant's exhibit 179, list of employees they allege  [*146] didn't have computer e-mail/internet accounts from 2008 through 2010 and the defendant's exhibit page 180 and Plaintiff EX. 00522 list of all Operating Engineer 1's and 2's working in section 834 at the Calumet plant during the periods of January 2008 through to July 2010 and the defendants June 17, 2010 seniority in class sheets of Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, plaintiff Exhibit 00523 to 00535, and plaintiff copies of the Calumet Plant different station log book pages of September 2009, Plaintiff Ex.00539 to 00557.

2. PLAINTIFF WAS DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOLUNTEER TO WORK FOR THE CENTRIFUGE OPERATING ENGINEER 1'S OFF ON THE WEEKENDS AND OFFERED OT-(OVERTIME) PAY FOR WORKING 2009 THROUGH TO FEBRUARY 20, 2010 :
3. On or about October 23, 2009 the Calumet Plant Manager's Thomas Conway, Brian Perkovich and Chief Paul Wysocki, and the two Assistant Chief Operating Engineer's Allen Nichols and Raymond Bonzani listed in plaintiff's answer #1 closed down the MWRDGC's Calumet Plant Centrifuge location of section 834, as stated in the Assistant Chief Allen  [*148] Nichols letter dated October 23, 2009 (plaintiff Ex. 00700).
4. The Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisor's listed in plaintiff's answer #1, moved all three shifts of Centrifuge personnel back to the main Calumet plant location of 400 East 130 Street of Chicago Illinois. That Centrifuge personnel, consisted of only Operating Engineer 1's, MLAS shift laborers, and the truck driver's of all three shifts, days, afternoons and midnights, that worked at the Calumet Plant outside Centrifuge location on a Monday through Friday work schedule with weekends off. The defendant's Calumet plant Managers and Supervisors moved the Centrifuge personnel back to the main Calumet plant in section 834, where only shift employees work rotating days off, and the shift employees don't get a weekend off every week, as a matter of fact, the shift employees in section 834, that consist of Operating Engineer 1's and 2's and MLAS Laborers, have to work seven (7) weeks before they can get a weekend off, see plaintiff's. EX #'s 00558 to 00595 for the 2005 to 2008 Collective Bargain Agreement of 35 pages, at pages 3/4, of paragraph A, of section 5 titled work week or Pl. Ex. 00596 to 00634 for the 2008-2011 Collective  [*149] Bargain agreement pages of paragraph A, of section 5, titled work week. On the same pages of 3/4 at paragraph 3 of section 4, titled Wages, the CBA's also state the different classification of an Operating Engineer I (OE1) and an Operating Engineer II (OE II's) and two different rates of pay for both Operating Engineer classifications. Also see plaintiff's deposition excerpt pages of the former Calumet Plant, Chief Hank Marks stating the same dated October 7, 2003 of pages 1 and 1055 of his cross, Plaintiff Ex.00635 to 00636 of 2 pages.
5. This was also during the time, the Calumet plant Managers and Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, were about to open up the new CBF, Calumet Boiler Facility, and rumor's had it the Centrifuge personnel would be operating that facility only, because of the abrupt closing of the Centrifuge. The Centrifuge personnel were moved to the Digester's in section 834, on all three shifts and were called extras, meaning they were not assigned a shift number or were they assigned as a regular shift employee in section 834, where only shift worker's, are assigned and titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's and MLAS Laborers, that all work on shift and are  [*150] assigned shift numbers for their days working and off. The Calumet plant section 834 of all three shifts require that all of its employees work only shift assignments and shift schedules, also an agreement made between, both the defendant and the Local 399 Union in their CBA/agreement, for the Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, cited in the CBA language as to the different classifications, work hours, wages and other benefits of the Operating Engineers, See Plaintiff's Exhibits #'s 00558 to 00595 and 00596 to 00634. The Calumet plant Supervisor's listed in plaintiff's answer #1 created several serious problems, by moving the Centrifuge Operating Engineers into section 834, where all Operating Engineer 1's and 2's there, have to work weekends with rotating days off each week. There were no extra relief to relieve the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off on the weekends before they were moved into section 834, because the vacation relief Operating Engineers of section 834 had to relieve the regular shift Operating Engineers 1 and 2, on there off days. The move caused a lot of overtime, friction and bad attitudes amongst the new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's that work at  [*151] the Tarp Pumping station, because some had transfers in to work a Monday through Friday rotation with weekends off, but were denied. The Calumet Plant Supervisors, Chief Paul Wysocki and the Assistant Chiefs Allen Nichols and Raymond Bonzani came up with, what they thought was a good ideal to rectify the problems they had made.
7. The Supervior named Allen Nichols, drafted up some sheets, one called a seniority volunteer list, dated 11/2009, Plaintiff Ex.00674 to 00678 and a sheet titled weekend procedure for coverage at the Digesters, Plaintiff Ex. 00679 and 00680. The supervisor Allen Nichols said on the Seniority Volunteer sheet at page 1, keep in mind, this is a special circumstance. For any Overtime (OT) regarding any other location in the plant or outside the plant, our current practice should prevail. The supervisor Nichols said the Seniority list is to be followed when overtime is needed to cover the Weekend Digester vacancy ( After Digester personnel Currently in the Plant) have turned down the opportunity to work the OT (overtime pay). The sheet further say the Tarp OE's and VR's(vacation relief's) covering the Digesters are to be considered Digesters personnel. See plaintiff's  [*152] exhibits 00674 to 00678 Calumet Plant Digester's volunteer by seniority sheets and weekly schedules that listed the OE1's who did volunteer to work and the one's that declined to work by their names written on the volunteer sheets, of 6 sheets, that is initial at the bottom of the sheet by Supervisor A.N, which stands for Allen Nichols, that had the dates of October 2009 through December 27, 2009. The Calumet plant supervisor Allen Nichols would type up the Digester's volunteer OT schedule sheet each week with the Operating Engineer 1's who volunteered to work for the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off on the weekends by their name on it. Strange as it seems, the Calumet Plant Supervisor Allen Nichols Digester volunteer seniority sheet did list plaintiff's name, even though plaintiff was never shown the Digesters seniority OT volunteer sheets, with her name on them or was plaintiff ever asked to volunteer to work for the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off on the weekends for the OT pay or was plaintiff ever asked to decline working for the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off on the weekends at the Digesters period. The following new and senior male Operating Engineer 1's Dennis  [*153] O'Rourke, Daniel Manning, Dan McNichols, Charles Gariepy, Martin Depas, Gary Andreas and Earl Ebers, Joe Gudio, Fran Blak and John McNamara all volunteered to work it, as long as they were being paid the OT (overtime ) pay. Plaintiff was already working at the digesters on a two day a week schedule only, because she had an MWRDGC approved ADA Accommodation that restricted her from working at that location for more than two days a week. Plaintiff knew of her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's working it listed on the Supervisors Nichols seniority volunteer sheet and receiving the OT pay, but didn't say anything because she couldn't work at the Digester's but two days a week, and her two day's of work had already taken place, because of her MWRDGC approved ADA Accommodations, she said nothing about her male co-worker's titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's making the OT pay. Plaintiff's MWRDGC approved ADA Accommodations had been in place since as early as 1998 and as recent as June 2003. Plaintiff believed this was the reason the Calumet Supervisors listed never asked or offered to work and receive the OT pay for working for the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's  [*154] off on the weekends from October 2009 through to February 19, 2010. Then all of a sudden the defendant's Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, tell all of the male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that had been volunteering to work for the OT pay, they will not be getting paid anymore to work it, starting in November and December 2009.
8. The Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that had been volunteering to work it, for the pay only, decided they were not going to work it anymore if they couldn't be paid. The Calumet Plant Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, had no other relied for the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off on the weekends and told the new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's, James Boyzk and Earl Ebers, the relief Engineer on days, and Dennis O'Rourke of afternoons, and Brian Pokrewczynski and Martin Depas- the relief Engineer of the midnight shift, to shut down the Tarp Pumping Station of their jobs and go to the Digester's every weekend on a Saturday and Sunday to relieve the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off on the weekends in a section that don't allow them to have weekends off every week, or any shift employee to  [*155] be off every weekend in section 834 and according to the CBA. The Tarp Pumping Station Operating Engineer 1's listed above, started to complain to the Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, by saying why do they have to work for the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off on the weekends and plaintiff don't ? There were no complaints made by the new or senior white male Operating Engineer 1's or the Vacation Relief Engineer's or regular Operating Engineer 1's or 2's when they were being paid the OT to work for the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off on the weekend. Plaintiff was never asked or offered to volunteer to work and receive any OT pay period or was she asked to decline to work period from October 2009 through to February 13, 2010. Plaintiff never even saw the Digester's seniority OT volunteer list as long as her co-workers, titled male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's were receiving the OT pay, as is stated in the defendant's Calumet Plant Supervisor Allen Nichols seniority volunteer list at page 1, dated 11/2009 with his initials A.N on it, and the two pages of weekly schedules of the Operating Engineer 1's that actually volunteered to work it in October 2009, as plaintiff's  [*156] Ex. 00674 to 00678 of 6 pages . Plaintiff never asked or assumed why she wasn't being asked or offered to work for the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off on the weekends, for two reasons, 1. Shift Operating Engineer 1's and 2's only work rotating shifts and have to work seven weeks, before they receive a weekend off, and 2. simply because plaintiff knew she had been MWRDGC approved ADA Accommodations from back in June 2003, that restricted her to work only 2 days a week at the Digester's because of allergies to the Polymer Chemical. The Supervisor's listed in plaintiff's answer #1, originally said the Centrifuge personnel would operate the new boiler facility, but then changed it to the Operating Engineer 2's that use to worked at the old Digester's office is going to operate the new Calumet Boiler Facility and the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's would be called just extras on each shift at the Digesters and work the vacant Operating Engineer 2 (OE 2) positions on all three shifts, even though the Calumet plant supervisor's knew that wouldn't work either, because the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's work Monday through Friday with weekends off and the vacant OE 2 position at  [*157] the digester's is a shift position and it included working on the weekends, and this was known before the supervisors listed moved the Centrifuge personnel back to the main Calumet plant. They supervisor knew there were no relief for the Centrifuge Operating Engineers, because the vacation relief Operating Engineers relieve only shift Operating Engineer's in section 834. The problem came when the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's had to be off on the weekends, and there were no relief for them. The following new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's, Dennis O'Rourke and Dan McNicholas, were asked and offered to work it and wrote they accepted to work for Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off on the weekends for the overtime pay, O'Rourke on November 29, 2009 and McNicholas on December 27, 2009, and the following Operating Engineer 1's named DeSousa, and Gariepy declined on 12/27/09, and Operating Engineer 2's Joe Prignano, and John McNamara declined to work it also on 12/27/09, all are listed on defendant's supervisors Allen Nichols (A.N.) Digester's seniority volunteer list, dated 11/2009. The fact that the defendant's supervisors Allen Nichols listed in plaintiff's answer  [*158] #1, gave the new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's a right to volunteer to work and receive the OT pay for working on the weekends for the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's and gave the other Operating Engineer 1's and Operating Engineer 2's listed above the right to decline to work it, but deny plaintiff the same rights and options given her new and senior white male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's is discrimination . The defendant's Calumet Plant Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1 never informed plaintiff of the new digester OT pay job or did he offered plaintiff the right to work and earn any OT pay, or did he let plaintiff make the choice to accept or decline to work it in writing, like her new and senior white male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, form the basis of plaintiff's Sex Discrimination claim in this lawsuit. The defendant threaten plaintiff to work at the Digesters for the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's off the weekend on February 20, 2010 without any OT pay and against her MWRDGC approved ADA Accommodations, and this constitutes Sex Discrimination and a violation of the Americans with Disability Act.  [*159] Plaintiff was harmed by not being granted the same rights as her male co-workers to volunteer and get paid or decline to work and get no OT pay on the weekends. Plaintiff was harmed by the denial of the extra OT pay from October 2009 through to December 27, 2009 paid to her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's for working at the Digesters on the weekends, plaintiff was harmed by not being allowed to increase her yearly income and standards of living, like her male co-workers who are similarly situated to plaintiff, plaintiff was harmed physically and mentally by the defendant's Calumet Plant Supervisors forcing her to endanger her health when forced to work in and around the Polymer Chemical, outside of her MWRDGC restricted ADA Accommodations. Plaintiff was harmed by being threaten to be punished severely if she didn't work it and was forced to work it, and none of her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's similarly situated to plaintiff were threaten to work it or threaten they would be punished. Plaintiff was harmed by her name being put on the defendant's Calumet digester weekly schedule, without her volunteering to work. See plaintiff's Ex. 001127  [*160] copy of the defendant's time sheet dated 2/20/10 and their weekly digester schedule, Plaintiff Ex. 00011 where her former Supervisor and Chief Paul Wysocki told plaintiff he was putting her name on the February 20, 2010 schedule to work, and she'd better be there, or she will be punished severely, whether she liked it or not, because the MWRDGC downtown's Human Resource Department told him, she don't have any ADA Accommodations in place, and he could do whatever he wanted to with plaintiff. The fact the defendant's Calumet Plant Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, allowed plaintiff's male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and Operating Engineer 2's to volunteer to work and be paid or decline to work and not get paid , and deny plaintiff the same rights, forms the basis of plaintiff's Sex and Race Discrimination claim in this lawsuit.
3. Identify each event, incident, or other occurrence, numbering each one separately, that forms the basis of your race discrimination claim in this lawsuit. For each event, incident, or occurrence, specify: a) the date it occurred; b) the location where it occurred; c) the method of communication (e.g., by phone, by letter, or in person);  [*161] d) the name of each person who was present or participated at the time; e) what was said, written, and or done that was discriminatory; f) the name of each person who committed the discriminatory acts; g) all facts and evidence you have that demonstrate this was race discrimination; h) how (if at all) the MWRD treated similarly situated employees (identifying them by name and title) more favorably than Plaintiff and i) how if applicable, the conditions of your employment were altered as a result of any discriminatory acts you identify.

ANSWER:
PLAINTIFF WAS DENIED THE OE2 UPGRADE IN PAY FOR WORKING IN THE VACANT POSITION OF THE OPERATING ENGINEER 2 (OE2) AT THE CALUMET PLANT DIGESTERS FROM SEPTEMBER 2009 THROUGH TO JUNE 20, 2010 :
The Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisor's listed above in plaintiff's answer #1. started the CBF trainings from September 14, 2009 through to October 16, 2009 and informed only the new and senior black and white, Male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's the trainings were being held and they are to take the CBF trainings and this included the Centrifuge Operating Engineer 1's ), because rumor had it in October 2009, they would be the one's operating the new Calumet  [*162] boiler Facility. Plaintiff was denied to the right to take any of the CBF trainings from September 14, 2009 to the present 2012, after her supervisor/Assistant Chief Allen Nichols stated on September 14, 2009, ALL Operating Engineer 1's and 2's would receive the CBF trainings in the presence of the two Operating Engineer 2's, Charles Jones and Tom Scannell in the Digester's office on the afternoon shift. On or about September 21, 2009 the Supervisor/ Assistant Chief Allen Nichols came back out to the Digester's and instructed the Operating Engineer 2 Charles Jones to go to the CBF training on that day. The Operating Engineer Jones said to the Assistant Chief Nichols, let De De (Plaintiff) go today and he could go next. The Assistant Chief said no, you go. The Operating Engineer 2 Jones said I mean I know a lot about the boiler's already and I run the Digester's office operation, why can't De De go first ? The Chief said no, I told you to go. Then plaintiff asked the question of the Assistant Chief Nichols, are all Operating Engineer 1's and 2's going to get the CBF trainings? The Assistant chief Nichols said yes on September 14, 2009, then on September 21, 2009 he changes what he said  [*163] to plaintiff on September 14, 2009, that all Operating Engineer 1's and 2's will receive the CBF trainings, but now plaintiff the only female Operating Engineer 1 will not be getting the CBF trainings, in the presence of the two Operating Engineer 2's Jones and Scannell in the digester's office . The Operating Engineer 2 Charles Jones asked the question, who is going to operate the new boiler facility? The Assistant Chief Nichols said, the Operating Engineer 2's. The Operating Engineer 2's Jones and Scannell asked who is going to work the vacant Operating Engineer 2 positions at Digester's ? The Assistant Chief Nichols said, the Operating Engineer 1's. Then plaintiff asked the question, are you saying the Operating Engineer 1's are going to do two jobs for the price of one ?
The Assistant Chief Nichols responded, are you saying you can't do your job ? Plaintiff responds, no I am not saying I can't do my job, I'm saying the Local 399 Collective Bargain Agreement don't allow me to do two jobs for the price of one and if I am made to do that I will be filing a grievance. The Assistant Chief said De De you will do what you are told. The Assistant Chief Nichols order's the Operating Engineer  [*164] 2, Charles Jones to go to the CBF trainings being held on September 21, 2009 and told plaintiff to do both jobs, his and hers. Plaintiff stated to both Operating Engineer 2's Jones and Scannell, after their supervisor Nichols left, that his decision to deny the only Afro-American female Operating Engineer 1, that actually work at the Digester's the CBF Trainings, constitutes Sex discrimination. On or about September 23, 2009 plaintiff calls from the digester's office to the former Calumet plant Supervisor and Chief of section 834, Paul Wysocki listed in plaintiff's answer #1 and tell him what the Assistant Chief Allen Nichols said, that she would not be receiving the CBF trainings and that plaintiff would have to work the vacant Operating Engineer 2 position without pay and her job duties as an Operating Engineer 1. The Chief says he told you right, you are not getting the training, plaintiff asked why ? The Chief Paul Wysocki said because you will not be going down there, and you will do the duties of the Operating Engineer 2 and Operating Engineer 1. Plaintiff ask the Chief, are you and Al telling me the CBF trainings are for only the male OE 1's and OE 2's ? The former Chief Paul  [*165] Wysocki said yes. I said I work at the Tarp Pumping Station where the white male Operating Engineer 1's ( OE 1's) James Boyzk, Dennis O'Rourke, and Brian Pokrewczynski work on all three shifts, and they are being allowed to shut down the Tarp Pumping Station and take the CBF Boiler trainings, why can't she take the CBF Trainings ? The Chief Paul said so, you are not getting the training. Plaintiff ask the question of the Chief Wysocki, why was he letting the male Operating Engineer 1's listed above who work at the Tarp Pumping Station take the training, and not her, and the fact she work there to ? The Chief said he instructed the men at the Tarp Pumping Station to shut down their stations to take the training in the event he had to bring them over there to operate the new Calumet Boiler facility, when the regular Operating Engineer 2 was off . Plaintiff asked why ? The Chief said because you won't be going down there.
Plaintiff stated to the former Calumet Plant Chief Paul Wysocki this is discrimination, and asked the Chief Paul Wysocki to give her a discrimination complaint form. The former Chief of section 834 told plaintiff he didn't have any discrimination forms and had to call  [*166] downtown for one. The Chief called plaintiff back at the digester's office on or about September 23, 2009 and said the defendant's EEO Complaints investigator Suzanne Boswik said she needed to call her. Plaintiff did call the defendant's EEO Complaint's investigator on the same day of September 23, 2009 to inform her about the Calumet Plant supervisor's unlawful discrimination and request a MWRDGC discrimination complaint from her. The defendant's EEO Complaint's investigator Boswik told plaintiff the defendant don't have any informal or formal discrimination complaint forms anymore and that plaintiff could tell her over the phone what happened or that plaintiff could put her concerns in writing and send them to her. Plaintiff chose to put her concerns in writing in her 3 page letter dated September 24, 2009, plaintiff EX.00690 to 00692. Plaintiff stated in her letter to the defendant's EEO Complaint's investigator that she was being discriminated against in training and wages by her Calumet Plant Supervisors listed in answer #1. Plaintiff stated she was denied the right to take the CBF trainings, being given to her new and senior black and white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's  [*167] and that she was told to work the vacant Operating Engineer 2 position at the Digesters without receiving the OE2 pay and her OE1 job for the salary of an OE1. Plaintiff stated to her, that her male co-workers, black and white, titled Operating Engineer 1's had been receiving OE 2 when working as an OE 2 since 1998 to the present 2009, but that she was being denied and plaintiff stated she was denied an e-mail account. The Defendant's EEO Complaints investigator Suzanne Boswik never responded to plaintiff's 3 page written discrimination complaint period . Then plaintiff receives a 3 page letter from the defendant's Assistant Director, Denice Korcal's, dated October 8, 2009, (plaintiff's. Ex. # 00693 to 00695) denying plaintiff's discrimination complaint filed with MWRDGC Complaint investigator Suzanne Boswik in September 2009, but says, if anybody tries to make you(plaintiff) do the duties of an Operating Engineer 2, without pay, plaintiff is to report it to the Calumet Plant Manager, Mr. Brian Perkovich. The defendant's Assistant Director Korcal, also stated in her letter why plaintiff didn't receive the CBF trainings and that being, she could not leave the Digester's work station  [*168] unmanned, while her supervisor, Operating Engineer 2 Charles Jones went to the CBF trainings, this is the first bit of proof plaintiff was made to work in the Operating Engineer 2 position without pay and her own position as an Operating Engineer 1, on September 21, 2009. Plaintiff did go to the Calumet Plant Manager Brian Perkovich, listed in plaintiff's answer #1, after she was made to work the vacant OE2 position in September 2009 without pay in October 2009, while the Operating Engineer 2 Jones went to the CBF Training. The defendant Calumet Supervisors officially transferred all of the Operating Engineer 2's for good to the CBF- Calumet Boiler Facility on or about October 22, 2009, after plaintiff received the defendant's Assistant Director Korcal of their Human Resource department, 3 page letter dated October 8, 2009, Plaintiff EX.00693 to 00695) response to her 3 page September 24, 2009 written discrimination complaint she filed inside with the defendant's Complaint Investigator Suzanne Boswik in September 2009, Plaintiff Ex. 00690 to 00692.
The Calumet Plant Manager Brian Perkovich said to plaintiff, why did she (Korcal ) tell you to contact me ? Plaintiff said the Assistant  [*169] Director Korcal sent her a letter dated October 8, 2009, that said if she was made to work as an Operating Engineer 2 without pay, she was to tell the plant manager about it, so that's what she was doing. The plant manager Perkovich did nothing, he just called downtown to the defendant's Assistant Director Korcal about plaintiff to coming to his office at her direction. The Assistant Director Korcal wrote plaintiff another one page mean spirited letter dated October 27, 2009,(plaintiff EX.#00701) wrongly accusing plaintiff of not going through the chain of command and just going to the plant Manager Brian Perkovich on her own, after she sent a letter telling plaintiff to go to him.
Plaintiff was only following the orders stated in the (Assistant Director's) 3 page letter dated October 8, 2009. Plaintiff did work the vacant Operating Engineer 2 position and did do the duties in September 2009, and from October 2009 through to June 20, 2010 after plaintiff was forced to work it against her approved MWRDGC ADA Accommodations and request not to, and was repeatedly denied the Operating Engineer 2 pay. Plaintiff is the only female Operating Engineer that worked on the afternoon shift at the  [*170] Calumet Plant in section 834, that was denied the CBF trainings out of co-workers, black and white, new and senior male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, who are similarly situated to plaintiff in job assignments and duties, same plant location, same section 834, same Supervisors, same classification, and represented by the same Local 399 Union, and plaintiff should make the same salary and wages as her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and should have received the OE 2 pay upgrade after working it like her male co-worker's, titled Operating Engineer 1's they received from 1998 through to the present 2012, when they work up as an Operating Engineer 2, but plaintiff was denied . Plaintiff did work on September 21, 2009 and from October 2009 through to June 20, 2010 on the afternoon shift as an Operating Engineer 2 in the vacant OE2 position, but was denied the right to take the CFB trainings that her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's were granted on all three shifts to take.
The defendant's CBF Training notice exhibit page 99 says the CBF Operations trainings will be for all three shifts, 1st, 2nd, and the 3rd shift, plaintiff worked on the afternoon shift  [*171] and was intentionally denied the CBF trainings, by the Calumet plant manager's and supervisor's Thomas Conway, Brian Perkovich, Paul Wysocki and Allen Nichols and Raymond Bonzani at the Calumet Plant in section 834. Plaintiff have never received the CBF boiler trainings period, in spite of what the defendant's Assistant Director, Denice Korcal said in her 3 page October 8, 2009 letter, that plaintiff would be trained by the one's that got the CBF Trainings. It has always been an agreement between the MWRDG and the Local 399 Operating Engineers Union to pay All black and white, new and senior male or female Operating Engineer 1's and 2's equal pay and the OE 2 upgrade in pay and the OT pay when an Operating Engineer 1 worked up as an Operating Engineer 2 or work over at all MWRDGC Plant locations, and according to the CBA's at pages 4-6, paragraph's A through M, of section 6, titled overtime . The Calumet plant supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, have and did approved the OE2 pay upgrade for the following new and senior, white male Operating Engineer 1's, Charles Gariepy, Earl Ebers, James Elboar, Martin Depas, Gary Andreas, Dan McNicholas, Dennis O'Rourke, Daniel Manning,  [*172] Gerald Batchler, Brian Donohue, Joe Gudio, Harry Caliban, Richard Walsh, James Boyzk, Brian Pokrewczynski, and Brian DeSousa, from January 1998 through to December 2009 and only stopped paying any Operating Engineer 1 the OE 2 pay upgrade and OT pay after plaintiff filed her 3 page September 24, 2009 letter detailing the discrimination she was encountering, of the denial of equal wages and that she was denied the OE 2 pay, plaintiff's Ex. #'s 00690 to 00692). Plaintiff's white male co-worker, named Charles Gariepy, titled a vacation relief Operating Engineer 1, filed a step 1 grievance form on or about November 9, 2009, saying he had been receiving the OE2 pay for over 14 years when he worked up as an Operating Engineer 2 at the same Calumet plant location in section 834, when he worked up at Digester's and the Central Control location and anywhere else in the District where there was an Operating Engineer 2 off and absent due to vacation, sick, duty, FMLA, ordinary disability or suspension and an Operating Engineer 1 is made or volunteers to relieve the OE2 for 14 years they get paid OE2 pay, but plaintiff was denied.
1. The following new and senior black and white, male Operating  [*173] Engineer 1's, named Charles Gariepy, Earl Eber, James Elboar, Martin Depas, Gary Andreas, Dennis O'Rourke, Daniel Manning, Gerald Batchler, Adam Fisher, Brian Donohue, Joe Gudio, Willie Davis, Harry Caliban, Richard Walsh, James Boyzk, Brian Pokrewczynski, Mark Vosburg, James Miele, Brian DeSousa and John McNamara all have received and still is receiving the OE 2 upgrade pay when they worked up as an Operating Engineer 2 or in the vacant OE 2 position at the old digester's office and in the Central Control office as an OE2 from 1998 through to the present 2012, but plaintiff the only Female Afro-American Operating Engineer 1 similarly situated to all her male co-worker's, black and white, titled Operating Engineer 1's is denied the OE 2 pay upgrade when she worked the OE2 vacant digester's position from October 2009 through to June 20, 2010. See Plaintiff's EX. #00673) copy of her white male co-worker, titled relief Operating Engineer step 1 grievance form he filed on November 9, 2009, saying he's been receiving the OE2 upgrade in pay for more than 14 years when he worked up as an Operating Engineer 2 at the Calumet Plant locations in section 834, called Digester's, and Central Control  [*174] and now at the New Calumet Boiler Facility where only the Operating Engineer 2's work on all three shifts, (See plaintiff's Ex. #00151 and the defendant's Exhibit. pg. 99 for day shift, and (PI #00153 and the defendant's Exhibit page 102 for the afternoon shift) and (plaintiff's. #00154 and the defendant's Exhibit page 103 for the midnight shift) Operating Engineer 1's and 2's of CBF training and attendance sign in sheets that show all the Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that took the trainings and the shift they took the CBF Trainings on. Plaintiff did contact the Calumet Plant manager Brian Perkovich in October 2009 about her working as an OE2 and being denied the OE2 pay and the plant manager Perkovich only said to plaintiff why did they tell you to contact me. The proof that plaintiff did meet with the Calumet Plant manager Perkovich is in the defendant's Assistant Director Korcal's October 27, 2009, 1 page mean spirited letter, where she wrongly accuses plaintiff of not going through the chain of command, plaintiff ex. # 00701). Plaintiff is the only female Operating Engineer 1 that work for the defendant, and worked up as an acting Operating Engineer 2 at the Calumet plant in  [*175] 2009 and 2010 and was denied the OE2 upgrade in pay. All Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that work up on all three shifts at the Calumet Plant Digester's and the Central Control location, have received and still is receiving the OE2 upgrade in pay when they work up as an Operating Engineer 2, but plaintiff is denied. Plaintiff worked up in the OE2 position from September 2009 through June 20, 2010, and was forced to work the vacant Operating Engineer 2 position at the Calumet Plant Digester's on the afternoon shift against her approved ADA Accommodations, where plaintiff was only supposed to work there 2 days a week. The persons that did it, are the defendant's Calumet Plant manager's, Thomas Conway, and Brian Perkovich, and Supervisors Chief Paul Wysocki, and both Assistant Chief's Allen Nichols, and Raymond Bonzani from September 2009 through to June 20, 2010, the other persons that heard or seen or wrote letters about these matters are listed above and the following person(s) correct titles and phone numbers and addresses are cited in Plaintiff's FRCP 26 (a)(1) disclosures.

ANSWER

This is a clear case of Sex Discrimination .
On or about September 23, 2009 Plaintiff called the Chief Operating  [*176] Engineer, Paul Wysocki and informed him of what the Assistant Chief Operating Engineer Allen Nichols said and did, that Plaintiff would not be receiving the new CBF training that the Assistant Chief Operating Engineers Allen Nichols and Raymond Bonzani said were mandatory trainings for all Operating Engineer 1's and 2's in September 2009. Plaintiff learned by talking to several of the new and senior, white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that actually took the CFB trainings, that they received a training Certificate for completing the CBF training program and a "flash drive stick" with the CBF training information on it for their future referencing and greater knowledge of how the new CBF operations really work, and the fact that the new and senior, black and white male Operating Engineer 1's and Operating Engineer 2's didn't have to trust anybody else to teach them about the CBF trainings, because they all were allowed to leave their work stations unmanned for 4 days to receive the mandatory job related CBF trainings, that the Defendant hired and paid expert's to teach with experience about the CBF trainings, and how the operations will work, but still to this month of September  [*177] 2012, and three years later, Plaintiff, is the only Afro-American female Operating Engineer 1 that received the CBF trainings or reference material or training certificate, that was guaranteed to her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's and was promised she would receive them, in the defendant's Assistant Director's Denice korcal's October 8, 2009 letter, she would receive the same CBF trainings that was provided to plaintiff's new and senior black and white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's on all three shifts in 2009 cited in the defendant's own CBF training and attendance sheets included with plaintiff answers.
The Defendant's Assistant Director Denice Kocal wrote in her 3 page letter dated October 8, 2009 plaintiff will receive the training from the one's that received the training and her reasons why plaintiff didn't receive the CBF training. The Defendant's Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisor's listed in plaintiff's answer #1 and the defendant's Human Resource staff and their Law Department, all denied Plaintiff the right to take the CBF Trainings, receive a training Certificate and the training reference material from September and October 2009 and a flash  [*178] drive with the training information on it for Plaintiff's future referencing and knowledge of how the new CBF boiler operations work. Plaintiff was denied the rights to future growth, and the Operating Engineer 2 pay upgrade that was freely granted to the following new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's similarly situated to Plaintiff as Harry Caliban, Gerald Batchler, Daniel Manning, and Dan McNichols, Martin Depas, and Gary Andreas, and an newly hired, white male Operating Engineer 1, named Paul Sullivan, who also have received the CBF trainings and the OE 2 pay upgrade when he worked up as an Operating Engineer 2 at the new CBF from 2011 through to the present 2012 and at the Central Control office, but Plaintiff was denied the pay and the same benefits and opportunities granted to her male co-workers listed above, to take the CBF Trainings, this is a clear example of Sex and Race discrimination. Plaintiff also learned by her own sight upon reviewing and writing in the different station log books at the Digester's, the Pump and blower floor and new blower building, and Tarp Pumping Station locations, plaintiff worked during the time period the CBF trainings were being  [*179] held at the Calumet plant in section 834, (See pl. Ex #00371,Tarp log, 00386-Digester's log, and 00387- Pump and Blower floor log, where plaintiff write in the different log books. Plaintiff learned that the Calumet Plant Supervisor's and Plant manager's ,Thomas Conway, Brian Perkovich, Paul Wysocki, and both Assistant Chief's Operating Engineers Allen Nichols and Ray Bonzani authorized the new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's listed to leave their work stations unmanned for 4 days while they attended the CBF trainings, but the defendant's Assistant Director Korcal states the reason plaintiff couldn't take the CBF trainings was, she couldn't leave the work station unmanned, while her partner, Mr. Jones was gone to the training, see pl. ex. #'s 00693 to 00695). Plaintiff is the only female Afro-American Operating Engineer 1 that worked the afternoon shift since January 1998 and to the present at the Calumet Plant that was denied the CBF boiler trainings given to all of her white and black male co- worker's, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's on the afternoon shift, as Adam Fisher, Dennis O'Rourke, Brian Donohue, and Operating Engineer 2, Charles Jones, plaintiff's partner  [*180] and supervisor that all work on the same shift as plaintiff, of afternoons at the Digester's and John Cunnane of the afternoon shift that work at the Central Control office as Supervisor, see pl. ex. #00153 for the Defendant's CBF boiler training attendance sheet #102 for the afternoon shift dated September 21, 2009 to September 25, 2009. The Calumet Plant Supervisor's listed above allowed all the black and white male Operating Engineer 1's and four Operating Engineer 2's John Cunnane, William Rokatis, and Kent Anderson, and John McNamara to leave their work stations unmanned to receive the CBF trainings, but denied plaintiff and her male supervisor and partner Mr. Charles Jones the same right, of leaving their work stations unmanned. Plaintiff was denied the CBF trainings, the right to leave her work station unmanned and denied the OE2 pay for working for her partner Charles Jones while he attended the CBF trainings in September 2009 and while she worked the vacant OE2 position after Jones was transferred from October 2009 to June 20, 2010. The following white male Operating Engineer 1's received the CBF trainings and wrote in the station log books they were gone to the boiler trainings,  [*181] as James Boyzk of 9/14/09 to 9/17/09, Dennis O'Rourke -9/21/09 to 9/24/09, Brian Pokrewczynski- 9/28/09 to 10/1/09, and Brian Donohue, and Martin Depas-October 1, 09 to October 4, 2009, they all wrote in their station log books of Tarp, Pump and Blower Floor, New Pump and Blower Building, Digester's and Central Control, gone to boiler training, and their stations were left unmanned, and they all do and did the same duties as Plaintiff the only Afro-American Female Operating Engineer 1 that was denied. See pl. ex. #00372 to 00383) station log book copies. Plaintiff informed the Operating Engineer 2 Union Steward, Thomas Scannell and Operating Engineer 2 Charles Jones, her partner and shift supervisor on September 21, 2009, that the MWRDGC's Calumet Plant Supervisor's actions of denying only plaintiff, the only Afro-American female Operating Engineer 1 to take the CBF trainings constitutes Sex discrimination and told her male supervisor Allen Nichols and Chief Operating Engineer Paul Wysocki the same and asked him (Paul Wysocki) for a discrimination complaint form on or about September 23, 2009. The supervisor Paul Wysocki replied he don't have any discrimination forms, he needed to  [*182] call downtown to the MWRDGC EEO Complaint's investigator Suzanne Boswick and requests one. The Supervisor called back to Plaintiff on September 23, 2009 and said he don't have any discrimination forms and that Plaintiff needed to call downtown. Plaintiff did call downtown to Defendant's EEO Complaints investigator Suzanne Boswick on the same day of September 23, 2009 and informed her of what had happen and Boswik replied, the MWRDGC don't have any informal or formal discrimination forms any more for the employee to fill out and that Plaintiff could tell her what she considered to be discrimination happening at the Calumet Plant or plaintiff could put her concerns in writing. Plaintiff Ammons-Lewis chose to put her allegations of Discrimination in writing in a 3 page letter dated September 24, 2009, (pl. Ex. #00690 to 00692 ) that she sent to Defendant's EEO Complaints investigator Suzanne Boswik, that included Plaintiff's denial of employee of benefits such as 02 pay, FMLA, vacation, the CFB boiler training classes and manuals, e-mail passwords and computer access and accounts and equal pay.

ANSWER

THIS IS A CLEAR CASE OF SEX DISCRIMINATION
On October 8, 2009 Plaintiff received a letter  [*183] from the Defendant's Assistant Director Denice Korcal denying plaintiff's allegations of Discrimination cited in her 3 page September 24, 2009 letter, but said in her October 8, 2009 letter to plaintiff if anybody tries to make you do the duties of an Operating Engineer 2 without the correct pay, plaintiff is to contact the Calumet Plant Manager, Mr. Brian Perkovich. The Calumet Plant Chief Operating Engineer Paul Wysocki and the two assistant chief's Allen Nichols and Raymond Bonzani did make Plaintiff work the Operating Engineer 2 duties, without the OE2 upgrade in pay, from October 2009 through to June 20, 2010, that the defendant freely paid to plaintiff's male co-workers, new and senior black and white Operating Engineer 1's named Dan McNicholas, Joe Gudio, Richard Walsh, Brian Donohue, Adam Fisher, named Harry Caliban, Charles Gareipy, Earl Ebers, Brian Poker, Martin Depas, Paul Sullivan, Daniel Manning, Dennis O'Rourke, Willie Davis, Brian DeSousa, James Miele, James Elbor, John McNamara, Gary Anderas, and James Boyzk, from January 1998 through to December 27, 2009, but forced plaintiff to do the same duties of working as an Operating Engineer 2 without pay, after she contacted  [*184] the Calumet Plant Manager Brian Perkovich about it, See Plaintiff's Ex .#00690 to 00692 letter) Defendant's October 8, and 27, 2009 letter from the defendant's Assistant Director Denice Korcal concurring with Plaintiff statement she did tell the Plant manager about working as an Operating Engineer 2 without the pay and plaintiff's male white co-worker Operating Engineer 1, Charles Gariepy's step 1 grievance dated November 9, 2009, (pl. ex. #00673) where he state he has been receiving the OE 2 pay for over 14 years and so does the CBA's say the Operating Engineer 1's are supposed to get it. The defendant did pay the new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's similarly situated to plaintiff the OE2 upgrade in pay from January 18, 1998 through to December 2009, that did and do the same duties as plaintiff, work at the same plant location and section 834 as plaintiff, is supervised by the same plant managers and supervisors at the Calumet plant as plaintiff and is in the same class of Operating Engineer 1's as plaintiff, but plaintiff was denied the OE2 pay. The Defendant's Calumet Plant Manager Brian Perkovich, denied Plaintiff the OE 2 upgrade in pay from September 2009 through  [*185] to June 20, 2010, after making her work as an Operating Engineer 2 and against her approved ADA of 2003 . The Calumet Plant Plant Manager's and Supervisor's listed in plaintiff's answer #1, all denied plaintiff the same rights as a male co-workers to request the OE 2 pay on the defendant's daily time sheets during this time period, that they allowed plaintiff's male co-worker's operating Engineer 1's to do, listed on the defendant's Exhibit page 180 list of all Operating Engineers in section 834, as plaintiff's Ex. 00522. The defendant's Assistant Director Korcal told Plaintiff in her 3 page October 8, 2009 letter, if someone makes you (plaintiff) work up as an Operating Engineer 2 without the OE2 upgrade in pay, you are to contact the Calumet Plant Manager Brian Perkovich and if you (plaintiff) are not satisfied with the defendant's (Assistant Director Korcals) findings written in her October 8, 2009 3 page letter, you (Plaintiff) can file with one of the out outside agencies listed in the defendant's Assistant Director's October 8, 2009 letter on the last page.

LOCATIONS WHERE THE DISCRIMINATION TOOK PLACE :
The different types of discrimination and the different types of denial of  [*186] job related trainings took place at the following locations, 400 East 130th Street, Calumet (CWRP) TARP PUMPING STATION, New High level Pumping Station (HLPS), the Calumet 95th and 125th Street Pumping Stations, and the New Calumet Boiler Facility (CBF) at the Calumet Plant (CWRP) and the Defendant's downtown Human Resources Department and Law Department.
All of the defendant's Calumet Plant training dates and titles of the trainings are stated on each defendant's Exhibit page training sheet and attendance sheets and Plaintiff's numbers on each page of their exhibit pages 56 to 172) provided by the Defendant to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on along with their position statements on July 23, 2010, responding to Plaintiff's charge # Charge #440- 2010-00001 cited in Plaintiff's initial FRCP 26 (a) 1 disclosure as Defendant's Exhibit pages 56 through 172, that include parts of the new CFB Training sessions held at the Calumet Plant's new Boiler Facility (CBF), cited in Plaintiff's FRCP 26 (a) 1 pages 30 and 31, that show the CBF trainings and other classes were freely granted to Plaintiff's male co-workers, OE 1's and 2's situated similarly to plaintiff from 2008 through  [*187] to 2010, but plaintiff was denied.
The Trainings were authorized by way of private notices sent Plaintiff's male co-workers , Operating Engineer 1's and Operating Engineer 2's private e-mail accounts, work station phones, via typed up notices left in the male employee's private mail boxes, or left in the station log books, and other's were done by verbal face to face communications from one the Assistant Chief's, and Chief to only the male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's. Plaintiff was denied an e-mail notification by way of a private e-mail account, because she didn't have one like her male co-workers similarly situated to plaintiff as Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that do the same duties as Plaintiff who would be entitle to the same trainings and benefits as her male co-worker's.

The MWRDGC has G-S Directives/Policies and Procedural Manuals for just about everything, even though plaintiff's Calumet plant managers and supervisors of section 834 continued to violate plaintiff's rights covered under their G-S Directives and policies. The policies that plaintiff used to answer the interrogatories about her Sex and Race claims of this lawsuit are below :
PLAINTIFF USED THE FOLLOWING DEFENDANTS POLICIES LISTED BELOW THAT ARE IN THEIR POSSESSION:
1.  [*196] The MWRDGC Computer Electronic Mail (E-mail) Use and Retention Policy Directive —G-S Directive 98-7, dated July 24, 1998 of 2 pages, Pl. Ex. #0666 to 00667) The policy says the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago's (District) electronic mail system is an important communication tool for staff member's in their daily conduct of business as alternative to face to face and telephone conversations, and other Correspondence of a transitory nature. Throughout the G-S Directive 98-7 the word employees is used and at page 2 it says E-mail is to be regarded as a tool to facilitate daily communications for official and authorized District business between employees or with outside parties. It further say E-mail communications are short-term in nature, and not to be used or relied upon as a storage medium to document official activities or decisions of the District. E-mail is not to be used as a replacement for letters or memos, or to circumvent official approval channels, this G-S Directive is authored by former G-S Hugh H. McMillian, Pl. Ex 0666 to 00667. The MWRD has an official application form they used, that the employee must complete in order to have access and use  [*197] of their computer and e-mail accounts, titled MWRDGC information technology department Computer Account Request Form, dated 021T0509, Pl. EX. 00669. The MWRDGC has another G-S Directive 91-3, dated July 10, 2006 titled District Computer Policy Directive of 11 pages, authored by G-S Richard Lanyon, Pl. EX 00655 to 00665, and a 1 page application, titled Maintenance Management Systems (MMS) Account Change Request, the form says this form is to be used to request additions, modifications, or deletions of Mainsaver User account access privileges, dated 061T0712 Pl. Ex.00685 to 00695. The G-S Directive Computer policy 91-3 says at par. 1.1 It is the policy of the MWRDGC to make the District's computer resources available to "any District employee" with a bona fide work-related need. The respective Department Head shall determine a bona fide need. Then at par. 1.4 it says before any computer access will be assigned, all persons requesting access to District computer resources are required to submit a Computer Security Agreement. The following paragraphs on pages 6 to 7 of 6.5, 6.5.1, to 6.5.3 regarding Internet connections. Then on pages 7 to 9 at paragraphs 6.8, titled Electronic Mail Systems,  [*198] paragraphs 6.8.1 Official Use and paragraphs 6.8.1.1 to 6.8. to 6.8.2.4 to 6.8.6.2 and 7.0 titled System Access Account paragraph 7.1 Account Administration of paragraphs 7.1.1 to 7.1.2 and paragraph 7.2 titled Password-Related user Responsibilities of paragraphs 7.2.1 to 7.2.4 and Log-Off Process, paragraph 7.3 and 7.3.1 to 7.3.2 and 7.4 titled Computer Systems Access Controls of pages 9 to 10 of paragraphs 7.4.1 to 7.4.5. Plaintiff received these policies long ago, and requested an e-mail and computer pass word account as early as 2002 and most recent was from 2007 through 2010, but was never offered or given either of the MWRDGC private e-mail or computer/main saver accounts from 2002 to September 2011 and both policies say the employee benefits are for all employee's use with approval of their Department Head. Plaintiff applied for an e-mail and computer main saver account through her afternoon shift Supervisor, Operating Engineer 2, Charles Jones as early as 2002 ,through the former Assistant Chief Operating Engineer Stephen Kelly, who had the authority to get plaintiff both accounts back as early as 1999, according to Pl.

They also gave the new Operating Engineer 1 Thomas Lannan an e-mail account, who was just hired in August 2012 and he'd only been employed 2 weeks, but plaintiff was repeatedly denied an computer /internet account and a computer password account, doing the exact same duties as her male co-worker's OE 1'S and OE2's that work at the same Calumet Plant location, in section 834, and hold the same Chicago stationary engineer's license, and under the same plant managers and supervisor's, and classified as an Operating Engineer 1 like her male co-workers since January 18, 1998 to the present 2012, and represented by the same union Local 399, and all received their e-mail accounts long after plaintiff had obtained her civil service status of October 27, 1987 and made her probation as an Operating Engineer 1 as July  [*212] 1998 and the fact plaintiff had more seniority on the job than any of the new white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that worked at the Calumet Plant, but plaintiff was repeatedly denied from January 2008 through to June 2010 and up to September 2011.

The MWRDGC went paperless in or about February 3, 2011, according to plaintiff's EX 00680, copy of an e-mail dated February 3, 2011 sent by analyst Andrew Dziadkowiec to Operating Engineer 1 Charles Gariepy informing him that the MWRDGC has gone paperless and he can get immediate access to his pay statement on the  [*213] District's Portal under the employee Self Service.

Plaintiff have been an employee with MWRDGC since October 27, 1986 to present 2012, but have been repeatedly denied an Computer/ internet-intranet account and Computer password since as early as 2002 through to September 2011 and according to the defendant's G-S Directive 98-7 Electronic E-Mail Policy, it says employees can receive e-mail accounts. The Defendant have freely given e-mail and computer password accounts to plaintiff's male co-workers, new and senior, black and white Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, cited in the defendant's inaccurate e-mail and computer account Exhibit list page 178 and PI Ex. 00229 that is supposed to be a true list of Operating Engineer 1's and 2's in section 834 of the Calumet Plant, located at 400 East 130th Street, Chicago, Illinois 60628 that did have an e-mail and computer password  [*216] account as of July 23, 2010. The list was provided by the defendant's Attorney James B. Murray on or about July 23, 2010, along with his position statements he sent to the EEOC investigator Kimberly Engram's, request for documents letter dated June 24, 2010 for plaintiff's amended charge #440-2010-00001. The new and senior, black and white Operating Engineer 1's and 2's listed are similarly situated to plaintiff, the only female Afro-American Operating Engineer 1 District wide, that in fact, do the same job duties as the male OE1's and OE2's, work at the same Calumet plant location and section 834, and is supervised by the same plant manager's and supervisor's chief and assistant chief's as the male OE1's and OE2'S, who are represented by the same Local 399 Operating Engineer's Union, and carry the same Chicago stationary Engineer's license as the male OE1's and OE2's, that are classified as Operating Engineer 1's, and 2's but plaintiff was repeatedly denied an Computer/internet /e-mail and computer password account from 2002 through to September 2011, and the defendant freely granted the new and senior black and white male Operating Engineer 1's Willie Davis, Dennis O'Rourke, James  [*217] Miele, Mark Vosburg, James Boyzk, Brian Pokrewczynski, Earl Ebers, Charles Gariepy, James Elboar, and new white Operating Engineer 1's John McNamara, Harry Caliban, Dan McNicholas, Gerald Batchler, Richard Walsh, Joe Guido, Adam Fisher, Daniel Manning, and newest OE1 Paul Sullivan, all doing the same duties as plaintiff, working in the same plant location and section 834 as plaintiff, carrying the same licenses as plaintiff, under the same supervisor's as plaintiff, and gave each of them an computer /internet accounts to do their work, communicate with the Supervisor's and chief's and downtown personnel and other statements made by plaintiff to her answers regarding her denial of Computer/ internet access. Plaintiff filed an original charge and several amended charges about the denial of an computer/internet account from January 2008 through to March 2010. The defendant's Attorney James B. Murray sent proof to the EEOC investigator Engram in July 2010, proving plaintiff was telling the truth that she didn't have an Computer/internet account, as is listed on the defendant's exhibit pages 178 and 179 list of people who did and did not have computer/internet accounts, but the defendant  [*218] chose not to list all of the male Operating Engineers 1's and 2's that actually did have a Computer/internet accounts, during the time period the EEOC investigator made her request of, such as Operating Engineer 1's Willie Davis, Dennis O'Rourke, and James Miele. The defendant's exhibit page 179 wrongly list the persons that don't have e-mail and computer accounts as plaintiff white male co-worker's Operating Engineer 1's Dennis O'Rourke, James Miele, Willie Davis, and Kenneth Bernatek, according to plaintiff's exhibits 00711 April 26, 1999 e-mail, and plaintiff's MWRDGC e-mail directory pages of 2001, (00712 to 00716) that prove the defendant's Attorney James B. Murray exhibit pages 178 and 179 is not accurate . Then defendant's Attorney James B. Murray also sent his exhibit page 180- Pl. EX 00231, list of all of the Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that was working in section 834 from January 2008 to July 2010 and the Operating Engineer 1's and 2's that transferred out and their titles, that are listed on their exhibit pages 178 and should, because of the time periods requested and when they transferred out. The defendant's Attorney James B. Murray exhibit page 180, Pl. Ex. 00748,  [*219] don't list the fact that some of the white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's who transferred out, all had an e-mail and computer account prior to them transferring out of section 834 of the Calumet Plant during the time periods requested by the EEOC investigator Engram on June 24, 2010, and they should have been listed on the defendant's exhibit page 178 as having the two accounts, which prove that the defendant Calumet Plant managers and supervisors go out of their way to take care of their male employees, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, and intentionally deny the one only female Operating Engineer 1 District wide the same benefits given to her male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's at the Calumet Plant.
The defendant gave the Calumet Shift Supervisor's a copy of their June 17, 2010 seniority sheets that show when all, new and senior, black and white Operating Engineer 1's and 2's got hired, pl. Ex.00523 to 00535, Plaintiff's seniority don't matter, the new and senior male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's got their Computer/internet accounts, without asking for it, the moment they got hired, but plaintiff did asked for them and was denied.
By the MWRDGC repeatedly  [*220] denying plaintiff a computer/internet and computer password account, for over 20 years, it has interfered with plaintiff's equal rights to the defendant's job related trainings, training certificates, training referencing materials, future growth, the OE2 upgrade in pay, plaintiff's yearly salary that she could have earned as working as a OE2 from October 2009 through to June 20, 2010 ,and would have given plaintiff an advantage when taking an OE2 promotional examination, transfers, reporting work accidents, employee benefit changes, and working as an Operating Engineer 2 at the CBF, Calumet Boiler Facility like her new and senior white male Operating Engineer 1's, Dennis O'Rourke, James Boyzk, James Elboar, Earl Ebers, Charles Gariepy, Martin Depas, Gary Andreas, Gerald Batchler, Danniel Manning, Dan McNicholas, Paul Sullivan hired in 2010 and newest white male Operating Engineer 1, Tom Lannan, hired in 2012. The defendant violated plaintiff's rights by giving only the male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's an Computer /internet account and access, and repeatedly denied plaintiff, who is similarly situated to all of the new and senior, black and white male Operating Engineer 1's and  [*221] this forms the basis of plaintiff Sex, and Race Discrimination claim in this lawsuit. The defendant Calumet Plant Supervisor's and plant managers listed above, allowed only the male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's to receive and use their private e-mail accounts to receive notifications of the job related trainings from January 2008 through to June 2010, to review their pay statements, and benefit changes from February 2011 to September 2011, while plaintiff couldn't review her pay statement until September 2011 after her male co-worker's received e-mails informing them of the change in how an Operating Engineer would review their pay statements and conduct business with outside locations and other employees of the MWRDGC and other departments of the MWRD, but plaintiff was denied an e-mail account and computer password from June 2007 through to September 2011. See Plaintiff's Defendant (MWRDGC) G-S Directive 91-3 titled District Computer Policy Directive, dated July 10, 2006 that says on page 1 at par. 1.4 - before computer access will be assigned, all persons requesting access to District computer resources are required to submit a Computer service agreement. Also on page 6, at par.  [*222] 6.5.3 it says the department must identify all activities of the position that can be accomplished more effectively using Internet services and why, it further say, access will be considered if it is a part of the employee's regular duties as described in their job description to (a) conduct District business through contact with professionals of the outside entities to give, obtain, or share information, (b) research external sources to obtain information; (c) get technical support from third parties; or (d) communicate with customers of the District where the Internet is the appropriate means for such contact. It also says at par. 6.8. 1.1 — Electronic mail (E-mail) is to be regarded as a tool to facilitate daily communications for official and authorized District business between employees or with outside parties, but plaintiff and her male co-worker's do the same duties, work at the same plant location and section 834, and are represented by the same union, and supervised by the same plant manager's and supervisor's titled Chief's and Assistant Chief's and plaintiff believe it make her similarly situated to her male co-worker's new and senior, black or white, titled Operating Engineer  [*223] 1's and 2's and plaintiff should have never been denied these employee benefits.
The defendant granted plaintiff's male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer'1s and 2's similarly situated to plaintiff, private e-mail accounts and computer passwords to do just what their Electronic and Computer policies say, but denied plaintiff the only female Afro-American Operating Engineer 1 doing the exact same duties, and working at the same Calumet locations and section 834, supervised by the same plant managers and supervisors, in the same job classification and received she received the same MWRDGC job descriptions for Operating Engineer 1's and 2's and is represented by the same Union Local 339 as her male co-worker's, new and senior, black and white Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, at the Calumet plant since January 18, 1998 to the present 2012, but the defendant Calumet plant manager's and Supervisor's intentionally denied plaintiff a private e-mail account and computer password and internet/intranet access, that they freely granted to plaintiff's male co-workers, Operating Engineer'1's and 2's, and this forms the basis of Plaintiff's Sex Discrimination claim in this lawsuit. The same persons  [*224] responsible for Plaintiff's denial to job related training's listed above, denied plaintiff the right to a Computer/ internet/intranet accounts and a password from January 2008 through to the present 2011. Plaintiff needed the computer password to be able to write up work order requests for failed equipment and to be notified about all job related trainings, the changing in her employee benefits, to report work accidents, to receive a notice about the MWRDGC going paperless and how to review her paycheck statements that went into effect in February 2011, that plaintiff could not receive, because she didn't have computer/internet access in February 2011 like her white male co-worker, named Charles Gariepy to go on line at their MWRDGC Portal sites on the internet or at her home, or to contact the credit union, the Human Resource department, claims, the MWRDGC's Retirement Board, the Board of Commissioner's and the Civil Service Board and plaintiff's plant supervisors and other employees of the MWRDGC from January 2008 through to September 2011. See the defendant's exhibit page 178 allege list of male employees( OE1's and OE2's) with computer/internet accounts and their exhibit page  [*225] 179 list of allege male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's without Computer/internet-intranet accounts, both provided by Defendant's Attorney James B. Murray to the EEOC investigator Kimberely Engram on July 23, 2010. Plaintiff just received her private e-mail account in September 2011, only because it was the only way she would be able to review her pay statements every two weeks, years after she continuously begged for an e-mail account, starting actually in 2002 through to September 2011. On or about August 31, 2011 Plaintiff was called into the Central Control office on the afternoon shift by her supervisor/Assistant Chief/Chief Allen Nichols and asked did she complete the documents he left for her pertaining to an e-mail account and a computer password account, and plaintiff's was told these forms are used when requesting a private e-mail account and computer password account. Plaintiff did not request the forms in 2011 and had been denied since 2002, by several of her supervisor's saying the computer e-mail account and access is not part of plaintiff's job and it is stated in the defendant's Assistant Director Denice Korcal 3 page letter dated October 8, 2009 at page 3 and paragraph  [*226] 2, the assignment of e-mail and computer access is made by Perkovich on a need —to-have basis only, PL. EX.00731 to 00732. Plaintiff made a little joke with her Supervisor Allen Nichols on August 31, 2011 and asked how much did the computer/internet account cost you ? The Defendant's Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, didn't give plaintiff the same unlimited computer/ internet access as her new and senior black and white male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's as Mark Vosburg, Harry Caliban, Dennis O'Rourke, Dan McNicholas, Adam Fisher, Charles Gariepy, Earl Ebers, James Boyzk, Kenneth Benatek, Martin Depas, Willie Davis, James Elboar, that do the same duties as plaintiff since 1998 through to August 30, 2011, in September 2011. Plaintiff's e-mail account has limited internet access and limits her on what she can access or who she can e-mail and what she can download, it's not like the one's her male co-worker's received that they have the capability to communicate with whoever they please at work and away from work. The Defendant's Computer and Electronic Policies say there are 3 different types of Computer/internet access accounts,  [*227] but plaintiff wasn't offered any, like the one's given to her new and senior black and white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's. The one Plaintiff was finally given in September 2011 was mainly for plaintiff to review her pay statements, because the Defendant went paperless in February 2011. Plaintiff tried to use the laborers computer in the main buildings hallway, and it wouldn't let plaintiff log in . The Operating Engineer 1, Mr. Mark Vosburg told plaintiff she needed to call downtown to the defendant's help desk. Plaintiff did call downtown to the MWRDGC help desk and spoke to a gentlemen, she told him what happened when she tried to use the laborer's computer and asked if he could help her create an account, so she could review her pay statements. The HR help desk male employee asked plaintiff if she was a new employer, because he didn't see her name listed in their computer data base. Plaintiff said no. The help desk person couldn't believe plaintiff didn't have any Computer/internet access or account, and said all the other Operating Engineer 1's and 2's have one. The defendant's help desk employee even said, this is discrimination. I replied I have been discriminated against  [*228] from 1989 to the present 2011. The help desk person told me to go see the Calumet plant computer analyst by the name of Sadigo Fredianeli to get the problem corrected. I did and the Calumet computer analyst informed me that I have a limited Computer/internet access account, and it's not like my male co-workers, Operating Engineer 1's and 2's, so the discrimination continues on. The following new and senior black and white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's have full Computer/e-mail internet access/accounts : Operating Engineer 1's Harry Caliban, Mark Vosburg, Dan McNicholas, James Elbaor, Brian DeSousa, James Miele, Dennis O' Rourke, Gerald Batchler, Kenneth Bernatek, Martin Depas, Gary Andreas, Paul Sullivan, Willie Davis, Joe Gudio, Brian Donohue, Daniel Manning, James Boyzk, Charles Gariepy, Earl Ebers, Richard Walsh. The new and senior, black and white Operating Engineer 2's as Charles Jones, Thomas Scannell, Willaim Rokatis, John McNamara, Robert McNamara, Adam Fisher, Fran Blake, Joe Stewart, Joseph Priganao, Kent Anderson, James Malone and John Cunnane, but plaintiff don't. This forms basis of plaintiff's Sex Discrimination claim in this lawsuit. See the Defendant's Electronic  [*229] (mail) and computer Policies included as plaintiff's exhibit #'s 00685 to 00695 and 00666 to 00667 and plaintiff MWRDGC December 6, 2001 E-mail directory for its employees.

ANSWER :
Plaintiff have been injured at work, while doing her jobs, 4 times in the 27 years of employment with the defendant, once in October 1997, whereby plaintiff fell of a ladder to the concrete while checking the gas vents, the defendant admit she fell off the ladder to the concrete, but refuse to give plaintiff further medical treatment her doctor said she needed back in 1997 through to April 2001 to September 2001 or settle plaintiff accident claim from 1997 to the present 2012. Plaintiff was injured at work while doing her job on December 12, 2001 through no fault of her own and her shift supervisor Charles Jones witnessed the accident and plaintiff's injuries, but was told not to fill out an accident report, and refuse to complete an accident report so plaintiff could receive medical treatment, all of the Calumet Plant Supervisors  [*234] witness plaintiff's injuries and refused to fill out an accident report and offer her medical attention from December 12, 2001 through to the present 2012, even though plaintiff was finally allowed to fill out an accident, she was still denied duty disability benefits, and the defendant's supervisor McCague altered the accident report that plaintiff filled out in 2002 in 2005 after stating he never completed one in his depositions of 2003 and plaintiff have been denied benefits from 12/12/01 to the present 2012, and plaintiff followed the defendant's accident reporting policies and procedures and rules for reporting work accidents. Plaintiff was injured on June 2, 2007 while at work and doing her job of getting her bubbler readings in the Calumet Plant's Digesters Concentration tanks 5 through 8 and a female witness name Selema Ali saw it and plaintiffs supervisor Charles Jones, Operating Engineer 2, witnessed plaintiff's injuries as a result of the work accident and he completed an accident report and called the defendants police to transport plaintiff for medical attention and they declined to take plaintiff to a defendant's contracted clinic, but called the Chicago Police and Fire  [*235] department for an ambulance, who transported plaintiff to a hospital that is not a listed contracted clinics of the defendant and took plaintiff to the Roseland Community Hospital, the defendant denied plaintiff any disability benefits from June 2, 2007 to the present 2012 and the Calumet Plant Manager Brian Perkovich altered a copy of the June 2, 2007 accident, and Plaintiff's Calumet Plant Chief Paul Wysocki altered the accident scene by busting up the concrete where plaintiff tripped and fell, and plaintiff's own Attorney agreed the plaintiff got injured as a result of a work accident and asked the Arbitrator to settle the accident claim, and the Arbitrator ruled in plaintiff's favor on May 17, 2010, but the defendant still refused to approved plaintiff for medical treatment and disability benefits from June 2, 2007 through to the present 2012. Plaintiff was injured at work on May 14, 2012 in the Calumet Plant Pump and Blower Kitchen and reported the work accident immediately to her shift supervisor John McNamara, who reported it to the Assistant Chief Operating Engineers, Allen Nichols and Raymond Bonzani that completed an accident report and approved for plaintiff to go to the  [*236] Ingalls Occupational health Clinic for medical treatment, and denied the work accident, even though the defendant's Calumet Plant Managers and Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1, knew plaintiff don't get a lunch period and have to eat lunch while working, and plaintiff was at work, the defendant denied this was a work accident. The defendant MWRDGC Claims and Law department have repeatedly approved disability benefits and Medical treatment, and transportation for plaintiff's new and senior white male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's as James Miele-2009, Brian Pokrewczynski- 2009, Earl Ebers-2010, and Harry Caliban- 2012 and Operating Engineer 2's Adam Fisher- 2012, Charles Jones- 2009, Tom Scannell- 2011, Robert McNamara-2011 without any witnesses, and just hearsay from 2007 through to 2012. Plaintiff had requested light duty restrictions in 02, 07, and 2012, in each of her work accidents, so she could come back to work and earn her salary and the defendant denied her saying they don't have any light duty restrictions, but on their time sheets of 2010 through 2012, they do have light duty to work restrictions. Plaintiff was released by her doctor and the defendant's  [*237] doctors on all several occasions in 2002 and 2003, 2007, and 2008, and in 2012 and requested light duty restrictions, but she was denied in 2002, 2003, 2007, 2008 and 2012, but was denied it also. The defendant have granted several of plaintiff's new and senior white male co-workers, title Operating Engineer 1's, named James Miele, Harry Caliban- 2012, Earl Ebers- 2010, and Brian Pokrewczynski — 2010 and Operating Engineer 2's Adam Fisher- 2012 ,Tom Scannell- 2011, Charles Jones- 2007, and Robert McNamara- 2011, duty disability benefits without any witnesses from 2007 through to 2012 at the Calumet Plant location, and have approved light duty restrictions for Operating Engineer 1's James Miele, and Operating Engineer 2's Tom Scannell, Robert McNamara, and Adam Fisher, and all do the exact same duties as that of plaintiff, who was denied light duty restrictions and disability benefits in 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012, and plaintiff had witnesses that saw her her work accidents and plaintiff's new and senior black and white male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's didn't, but were approved for both benefits, and plaintiff was denied. Plaintiff filed an inside discrimination  [*238] complaint on MWRD discrimination forms on July 20, 2007 with the defendant's EEO Complaint investigator Suzanne Boswik. The defendant's EEO complaints investigator responded on July 25, 2007 telling plaintiff she was correct in part and wrong in part, but did not tell the defendant's claims department to approve plaintiff's disability benefits period from 2007 through to the present 2012. The shift employees in section 834 don't have an official lunch break and is told to eat their lunch while they are at work, an agreement the defendant made with Local 399 Operating Engineers Union in the CBA. The defendant knew this, and have provided kitchens at all of their plants locations from 1986 through to the present 2012, for the Operating Engineer 1's and 2's to eat in, the defendant is the one that provided the stoves, and refrigerators, microwaves, dishes, pots, knives and forks, toaster, water fountains, sinks, tables and the chairs, meaning that if a shift employee gets hurt while trying to grab a lunch while he or she is still working, this called a work accident, and is called job related work accident and injury, according the MWRD and local 399 CBA. Each time plaintiff got injured,  [*239] the defendant, treated plaintiff's work accidents and injuries like a joke, they didn't interview plaintiff or don't the correct accident forms. The defendant's Calumet Safety inspectors never interview plaintiff and complete their necessary forms, when an employee get injured. The Supervisors listed in plaintiff's answer #1 never interviewed plaintiff about any of her work accidents or did the defendant's claim adjuster's Vincent Mathe and Sandra Belford interview plaintiff about any of her work accidents, they just altered the accident report and accident site. Plaintiff is made to use Family Leave benefits for a work related injury and denied disability benefits. Plaintiff has to transport herself to and from the emergency rooms and pay for medical treatment, but plaintiff's male co-workers, titled Operating Engineer 1's and 2's are approved for every benefit plaintiff is denied listed, without following the defendant's accident policies. The defendant's Claims Adjusters Sandra Belford and Vincent Mathe, never contact plaintiff, before they deny plaintiff to medical treatment. Plaintiff have been repeatedly denied duty disability benefits and worker's compensation benefits after  [*240] being injured on the job, but plaintiff's male co-workers are always approved. All of plaintiff's work accidents occurred at the defendants Calumet Plant, located at 400 East 130th Street, Chicago IL at the Digester's. All of plaintiff's Plant Managers and Plant Supervisors, and the MWRDC Law Department and their Claims department, and their Human Resource Department, listed in plaintiff's answer #1 denied plaintiff duty disability benefits, medical treatment, and light duty restrictions, and the right to settle any of her work accidents from 1997 through 2012. This forms the basis of plaintiff's Sex discrimination claims in this Lawsuit.

EX 00969 to 00971, which is not permitted under the Family Leave Law, plaintiff never requested her supervisor Allen Nichols to request family leave benefits for her or her daughter in 2010, because plaintiff was already off on Ordinary disability and the fact the defendant never approved plaintiff FMLA benefits after meeting their requirements on July 8, 2010. On September 9, 2010 plaintiff receive a letter from the defendant's FMLA Coordinator Megan McLaughlin saying plaintiff requested to apply for FMLA benefits for her adult daughter, and included with the letter was another Employee FMLA Eligibility form she had completed and also included was a form titled MWRDGC Adult Child Health Provider form Attachment and 2 pages of medical certification documents for plaintiff's daughter's doctor to complete and send all back by October 9, 2010, PL.

Plaintiff called the defendant's FMLA coordinator and asked why haven't she received an FMLA approval letter and the defendant's FMLA coordinator said because you daughter's doctor did not answer the MWRDGC Adult Child Health Provider Form, plaintiff said the doctor said that she cannot answer that, the defendant would have to get that information from Social Security. The defendant's FMLA coordinator said, then you are denied. The defendant's FMLA Coordinator never send plaintiff a denial or approval letter from July 31, 2010 to the present. Plaintiff file with the United States Department of Labor about it in June 21, 2011, the United States  [*275] Department of Labor said the defendant should have approved plaintiff FMLA benefits the moment they learned it was a FMLA covered event.

The Defendant Human Resources analyst Roxanne Bonner requested of the DOL to review the Defendant's Family Leave policies, and after the DOL view, they instructed the defendant to destroy their Adult Child Care Form the defendant's FMLA Coordinator Megan McLaughlin said to plaintiff's social worker, Shondra King, the reason the defendant is not approving family benefits for plaintiff is they can't stand her. The Fact that the Defendant approved plaintiff's male co-worker's new and senior, black and white, Operating Engineer 1's and 2's family leave benefits to care for their Adult family members, and denied plaintiff who do the same duties as them and who carries the same job title as all, it make plaintiff similarly situated to the male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's with the same job titled as the Operating Engineer 1's and 2's granted family benefits to care for their "Adult love one's. The defendant's denial of Family benefits to plaintiff and granted it to the male Operating Engineer 1's  [*284] and 2's, forms the basis of the Plaintiff Family Leave discrimination complaint and plaintiff's sex discrimination claim. The following defendant's employee's denied plaintiff family benefits in 2007 and 2010, they were FMLA Coordinator Tove Powell for Plaintiff in 2007 her herself. The Defendant's FMLA Coordinator Megan McLaughlin denied Plaintiff FMLA benefits in 2010 for herself and for plaintiff to care for her Adult child (daughter) after sending to eligibility letters saying plaintiff met the required hours to receive it. All persons, titles and addresses and phone contacts are listed in plaintiff's FRCP 26 (a) 1 disclosures.
The other person's that approved the denials, were the Defendant's former Director Patrick Foley, EEO Officer/Assistant Director Francis Wilkins, and Denice Korcal, and FMLA Coordinator Supervisor Suzanne Boswik, and Roxanne Bonner of the Defendant's Human Resource Department from 2007 through 2010. All titles, addresses and phone contacts are listed in Plaintiff's FRCP 26 (a) 1 disclosures. Plaintiff never received any denial or approval letters, which is required under the Federal Family Medical Leave Act and the U.S. Department of Labor's in their Family  [*285] leave act book of 2010.
The defendant intentionally altered their FMLA Policy and documents to deny Plaintiff family leave benefits to care for her adult Child (daughter) who was an adult in 2009 and the defendant didn't require plaintiff's adult Daughter doctor's to complete any Adult Child Care sheet in 2009 stating her daughter's medical condition and illness (Sickle Cell Anemia) was covered under the Americans with disability Act. The following white and black male Operating Engineer 1's Earl Ebers, Willie Davis, and Kenneth Bernatek and the following Operating Engineer 2's James Malone and Thomas Scannell all have received Family leave benefits to care for their adult family members and were not made or required to have their adult family member's doctor's complete an Adult Child Care form from 2007 through to the present 2012.
Plaintiff filed with the U.S. Department of Labor in June 2010 and the United States department of labor instructed the Defendant to redo their Family Leave Policy and to get rid of the Adult child care form and to change some of the language in the Defendant's Family Leave policy administrative manuals of 2009 through to the present and send them and plaintiff  [*286] a copy. The U.S. Department of Labor said the Defendant should have approved plaintiff's FMLA benefits for her daughter once they received plaintiff FMLA request.
The Defendant denying plaintiff Family leave benefits for plaintiff and for her to care for her adult daughter, but grant plaintiff's male co-workers, titled operating Engineer1's and Operating Engineer 2's FMLA benefits to care for their Adult family member's forms the basis of Plaintiff's Sex Discrimination Claim in this lawsuit.
PLAINTIFF HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY DENIED WORK COMP BENEFITS OF MEDICAL, DISABILTY, AND LIGHT DUTY RESTRICTIONS TO RETURN TO WORK, TRANSPORATION, ALL THAT HAVE BEEN FREELY GRANTED TO HER MALE CO-WORKER'S TITLED OPERATING ENGINEER 1'S AND OPERATING ENGINEER 2'S FROM 2007 THROUGH 2010 :
Plaintiff Ammons-Lewis have been an Operating Engineer 1 at the Calumet plant in section 834 since July 1998, always working on the afternoon shift, her work hours are from 2:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., plaintiff's job duties consist of her working at three different Calumet Plant locations at the same plant in section 834, the Digester's for two days, Tarp Pumping Station for two days and on the Pump and Blower Floor for one  [*287] day, 5 days a week, with rotating days off. The defendant's Calumet plant has a 24 hour operation, Plaintiff and all shift employees don't get a daily lunch period, plaintiff and all the shift employees have to eat lunch during their work time, at their work stations. Plaintiff Delores Ammons —Lewis was injured on December 12, 2001 while at work and have been repeatedly requesting medical treatment and the right to complete an accident report, plaintiff was denied. Plaintiff have been denied work comp benefits for this work accident and its injuries since December 12, 2001 to the present 2012. Plaintiff finally was allowed to fill out an accident mailer in May 2002 and that accident report was altered by plaintiff's former supervisor James McCague, 4 years later, who didn't witness the work accident and don't work on the afternoon shift. Plaintiff was injured on June 2, 2007 at work, while doing her duties of taking bubbler readings, plaintiff sustained injuries, due to the accident and her injuries were witnessed by other employees, but plaintiff was denied duty disability, light duty restrictions, transportation from the Rosland Community Hospital back to the Calumet Plant. Plaintiff's  [*288] shift supervisor Charles Jones filled out the accident report and witnessed plaintiff's injuries on that date. The Calumet Plaint Manager Brian Perkovich altered the accident report without talking to plaintiff, and without him witnessing the accident and the fact he don't work on weekends of when the accident happened for him to be altering the accident mailer. The Chief Operating Engineer Paul Wysocki said Plaintiff's shift supervisor Charles Jones called him at home, pl. Ex.12, not true. Plaintiff was recently injured at work on or about May 14, 2012, while working and trying to fit in a lunch, and accidently lacerated her left middle index finger and had to receive medical attention and six stitches on her own for the work injury, because the defendant denied it. Plaintiff requested to come back to work with light duty restrictions in May 2012 and was denied that as well, even though the defendant's letter of July 2003 say they have light duty restrictions, and the fact the defendant just recently approved light duty restrictions for a white male Operating Engineer 2, named Adam Fisher on or about June 14 2012 and he is still receiving it as of September 2012, at the Calumet Plant,  [*289] the male Operating Engineer 1 relives plaintiff on her off days and do the exact same duties as plaintiff on the afternoon shift on the Pump and Blower, who could have worked for plaintiff, while she worked in the Central Control office answering the telephone and logging readings every 2 hours and sitting, but plaintiff was denied.
This forms the basis of plaintiffs Race and Sex Discrimination claims in this lawsuit. The defendant's Calumet Plant Managers Conway and Perkovich, and plaintiff's Supervisors, Nichols and Bozani listed in plaintiff's answer #1, all approved the white male Operating Engineer 2 John Cunnane to work for the white male Operating Engineer 2 Adam Fisher and let him stay in the Central Control Office, instead of making him work on the Pump and Blower floor, where plaintiff work when he relieves her on her off days, but plaintiff was denied light duty restrictions. The defendant actions to approve Mr. Adam Fisher, Operating Engineer 2 light duty restrictions, who is similarly situated to plaintiff and work for plaintiff, doing the exact same duties and deny her, forms the BASIS OF PLAINTIFF'S RACE and SEX DISCRIMINATION CLAIM.
The Defendant's repeated approvals  [*290] of worker's comp benefits for their new and senior white and black male Operating Engineer 1's named Earl Ebers in 2009- 2010, James Miele in 2008-2009, Brian Poker in 2007 and recently in August 2012 for Operating Engineer 1 Harry Calian and their approvals of new and senior, black and white male Operating Engineer 2's named Charles Jones — 2009-2010, Thomas Scannell in 2010-2011, Adam Fisher in 2012, Robert McNamara in 2009-2010, but continue to deny plaintiff worker compensation benefits forms the BASIS OF PLAINTIFF'S RACE and SEX DISCRIMINATION CLAIM, because the male Operating Engineers 1's and 2's are similarly situated to plaintiff in salary, job duties, same work location and title and the fact plaintiff is the only female Operating Engineer 1 that is being repeatedly denied work comp benefits when she sustain injury at work in section 834 at the Calumet Plant and is always denied Worker's Compensation benefits, but defendant is freely granting work comp benefit to the male Operating Engineer 1's and 2's new and senior, black and white from 2007 through to the present 2012. The following benefits were denied at the Calumet Plant, located at 400 West 130th Street in Chicago  [*291] Illinois 60628. The following persons denied plaintiff worker's compensation benefits at the Defendant's Calumet from 2007 through 2012 are : Thomas Conway, Brian Perkovich, Paul Wysocki, Nicholas Allen, Raymond Bonzani, and defendant's downtown personnel of Director Patrick Foley, Denice Korcal, G-S Richard Lanyon, Osoth JamJun, Francis Wilkins, Suzanne Boswik, Claims Adjuster's Sandra Belford, and Vincent Mathe, and Eric Walton, all addresses, titles and phone contacts are listed in plaintiff's FRCP 26 (a)(1) disclosures.

PLAINTIFF HAVE BEEN DENIED EQUAL PAY (OE 2 PAY WHEN WORKING UP AS AN OE2) THAT WAS GRANTED TO SIMIARLY SITUATED NEW AND SENIOR, BLACK AND WHITE OPERATING ENGINEER1'S LIKE PLAINTIFF FROM OCTOBER 2009 THROUGH JUNE 20, 2010. THE DEFENDANT'S CALUMET PLANT SUPERVISORS ASKED THE NEW AND SENIOR OPERATING ENGINEERS 1'S TO VOLUNTEER TO RELIEVE THE CENTRIFUGE OE1'S OFF ON THE WEEKENDS WITH 02 PAY FOR WORKING THE VACANT  [*292] OE 2 POSITION AT DIGESTER'S. All ARE SIMIARLY SITUATED TO PLAINTIFF, AN OPERATING ENGINEER 1's FROM 1998 THROUGH NOVMBER 2009, BUT DID NOT OFFER PLAINTIFF THE SAME BENEFIT, EVEN THOUGH PLAINTIFF'S NAME IS LISTED ON THE OT SHEET IN 2009 :

THE CLOSING OF THE CENTRIFUGE AND THE OPENING UP OF THE NEW DIGESTER BOILER FACILITY GENERATED THE NEED FOR THE DEFENDANT TO PAY OT AND OE 2 UPGRADE PAY
The defendant closed down their Centrifuge location and transferred all of the personnel there of Operating Engineer 1's, laborers and truck drivers on all three shifts at the Calumet main plant located at 400 West 130th Street or about October 23, 2009. The new and senior, and black and white male Operating Engineer 1's of the Centrifuge, that only work 5 days a week, Monday through Friday with weekends off, and don't work rotating shifts like Plaintiff or any of the shift personnel of section 834 at the Calumet Plant main location. The Defendant's Assistant Chief Allen Nichols posted a letter dated October 23, 2009 announcing the closing of the Centrifuge and stated all personnel will be working at the Main Calumet Plant on all three shifts as extras in section 834. The defendant didn't put any of  [*293] the Centrifuge personnel into the correct shift rotation work schedules, that require the shift personal in section 834 to work weekends, but instead gave them their weekend off in a section that don't have weekends off, they instead just drafted up an Digester's volunteer OT work schedule for the new and senior Male Operating Engineer 1's to volunteer to work and receive OT pay if they worked for the Centrifuge OE1's off on the weekends at the Digester in section 834, as a matter of fact, Plaintiff and all shift personal have to work seven weeks straight before we receive a weekend off. See Pl. Ex 9, Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago and Local 399 Operating Engineer's Union Collective Bargain Agreements of 2005-2008 and 2008 to 2011 that prohibit this under the section titled work week.
