Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Brittani Williams originally filed this action in the Superior Court of Clayton County on December 9, 2019, and Defendants removed the action to this Court on January 13, 2020.1 Plaintiff [*2]  alleges that she was employed by the Clayton County Sheriff's Office and Clayton County, Georgia, and that her employers discriminated against her on the basis of a disability, and retaliated against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation for a disability, in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehabilitation Act"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 794, et seq., and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. Plaintiff also asserts a claim of disability discrimination under O.C.G.A. § 34-6A-4, and a claim of retaliation in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq.
The action is before the Court on the Motion for Summary Judgment [79] filed by Defendant Derrick Farmer ("Farmer"), and the Motion for Summary Judgment [83] filed by Defendants Clayton County, Georgia ("the County"); Victor Hill, in both his individual capacity and official capacity as the Sheriff of Clayton County ("Sheriff Hill"); and Richard Moen, in his individual capacity ("Captain Moen") (collectively the "Defendants"). For the reasons discussed below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Farmer's Motion for Summary Judgment [79] be GRANTED, and RECOMMENDS that the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.

I. DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
A. Facts
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following [*3]  facts from the Defendants' "Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment" [83-1] ("Def. SMF"), Plaintiff's "Statement of Additional Material Facts" [93] ("Pl. SMF"), and their associated exhibits. Some facts may also be taken from Plaintiff's "Response to Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts" [94] ("Pl. Resp. SMF") and Defendants' "Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts" [100-1] ("Def. Resp. SMF"). As indicated and as needed for clarity, the Court may also draw some facts directly from other material in the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.").
For those facts submitted by Defendants that are supported by citations to record evidence, and for which Plaintiff has not expressly disputed with her own citations to record evidence, the Court must deem those facts admitted, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(B). See LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGa ("This Court will deem each of the movant's facts as admitted unless the respondent: (i) directly refutes the movant's fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (ii) states a [*4]  valid objection to the admissibility of the movant's fact; or (iii) points out that the movant's citation does not support the movant's fact or that the movant's fact is not material or otherwise has failed to comply with the provisions set out in LR 56.1(B)(1)."). Accordingly, for those facts submitted by Defendants that Plaintiff has failed to dispute with citations to record evidence, the Court must accept the facts as true, so long as the facts are supported by citations to record evidence, do not make credibility determinations, and do not involve legal conclusions. See E.E.O.C. v. Atlanta Gastroenterology Assocs., LLC, No. CIV. A. 1:05-CV-2504-TWT, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11312, 2007 WL 602212, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2007).
The Court has also excluded assertions of fact by either party that are clearly immaterial, or presented as arguments or legal conclusions, and has excluded assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record or asserted only in a party's brief and not in its statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B)(1), NDGa ("The court will not consider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence . . . or (d) set out only in the brief and not in the movant's [or respondent's] statement of undisputed facts."); see also LR 56.1(B)(2)(b) (respondent's statement of facts must also comply with LR 56.1(B)(1)). The Court has nevertheless viewed all evidence [*5]  and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on a defendant's motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
The Clayton County Sheriff's Office ("CCSO") is a law enforcement agency operating 24 hours a day. Def. SMF at ¶ 1. The Sheriff of Clayton County oversees the CCSO and is functionally independent from the County governing authority. Def. SMF at ¶ 2. Georgia's Constitution "grants the state legislature the exclusive authority to establish and control a sheriff's powers, duties, qualifications, and minimum salary." Def. SMF at ¶ 3 (quoting Ga. Const. art. IX, § 1, P 3(a)-(b)). Georgia law specifies qualifications and training of sheriffs, sets minimum salaries for sheriffs, and allows sheriffs to directly appoint deputies. Def. SMF at ¶ 4 (citing O.C.G.A. §§ 15-16-1, 15-16-3; 15-16-20, 15-16-26, 15-16-23).
In 1994, CCSO employees came under the Civil Services Rules. Def. SMF at ¶ 5. Accordingly, while the elected sheriff is not subject to the civil service system, persons occupying positions in his office are. Def. SMF at ¶ 6. The County does not exercise any control over the day-to-day operations of the CCSO or its employees. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 7-8. The County has no authority to supervise the Sheriff's Office employees, establish their work schedules, [*6]  or direct their work assignments. Def. SMF at ¶ 9; Pl. Dep. [75] at 284. Sheriff Hill has sole authority to supervise CCSO employees, including their work schedules and work assignments. Def. SMF at ¶ 10; Pl. Dep. at 284. Clayton County also does not control the Sheriff's hiring and firing decisions, nor does it control the day-to-day work assignments or conditions of the employees of the Sheriff's Office. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 11-13; Pl. Dep. at 284.
The County did not assign or control Plaintiff's work hours, work assignments, work schedules, or hours of work. Def. SMF at ¶ 14; Pl. Dep. at 284. The County does not have the power to hire, fire, promote, or demote CCSO employees, and only the Sheriff has that power. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 15-16; Pl. Dep. at 284. Defendant Farmer and Captain Moen lacked power to hire, fire, promote, or demote CCSO employees. Def. SMF at ¶ 17; Pl. Dep. at 284.
On August 1, 2011, Plaintiff applied to work at the CCSO as a Correctional Officer. Def. SMF at ¶ 18. In July of 2012, former Sheriff Kimbrough hired Plaintiff as a Correctional Officer. Def. SMF at ¶ 17. In 2015, Plaintiff asked to switch to a clerical position due to childcare and medical issues after a workplace [*7]  injury to her back. Def. SMF at ¶ 20. Sheriff Hill granted Plaintiff's request to transfer to the position of Sheriff's Services Clerk. Def. SMF at ¶ 21. After her transfer, Plaintiff worked on the evening watch from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the Warrants Division. Def. SMF at ¶ 22. At some point in 2017, Plaintiff transferred to the day shift in the Records department. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 3-4.
The clerical staff works one of three shifts. Def. SMF at ¶ 23. The three shift blocks were day shift from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., evening shift from 2:00 p.m to 10:00 p.m., and then morning watch shift from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Def. SMF at ¶ 24. When fully staffed, the CCSO employed approximately 50 clerks with roughly 30-35 clerks on day watch, 10 on evening watch, and 5-6 on morning watch. Def. SMF at ¶ 25. On an unspecified date, Plaintiff moved to the Records Division, then moved back to the Warrants Division as her final shift assignment. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 26-27. Throughout her time as a Sheriff's Services Clark, Plaintiff worked either in the Records or Warrants Division. Def. SMF at ¶ 28.
As a Sheriff's Services Clerk, Plaintiff interacted with members of the public, law enforcement officers, strangers, [*8]  and visitors to the CCSO of all genders. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 30-31. In the Warrants Division, Plaintiff would interact with the public, pull warrants, and update warrants on the GCIS system. Def. SMF at ¶ 32. Plaintiff agreed that the essential functions listed in the Sheriff's Services Clerk job description are accurate. Def. SMF at ¶ 29.
Sheriff's offices operating in Georgia are required to participate in the GCIC's record verification program, which sets forth procedures for reviewing the validity of warrant entries contained on the GCIC's CJIS network. Def. SMF at ¶ 33. These procedures include reviewing monthly validation listings sent out by the GCIC and checking in some manner with the issuing authority to verify that a warrant has not been recalled or withdrawn. Def. SMF at ¶ 34. Warrant record entries that are no longer valid must be cancelled, and warrant record entries containing erroneous information must be supplemented or corrected. Def. SMF at ¶ 35.
The GCIC Council Rules require a triannual audit of the CCSO and other sheriff's offices. Def. SMF at ¶ 36. The GCIC Council Rules explicitly make warrant "validation procedures, records, and supporting documents . . . subject [*9]  to GCIC and NCIC audits." Def. SMF at ¶ 37; Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 140-2-.07(1); 140-2-.14(2). Auditors obtain a statistical sample of active wanted, missing person, and stolen vehicle files from the Sheriff's Office and review its files for compliance with the GCIC rules and regulations, including a review of its training records and validation procedures. Def. SMF at ¶ 38. If the CCSO violates GCIC Council Rules or network policies, then it is subject to a broad array of sanctions, including suspension or revocation of GCIC network access. Def. SMF at ¶ 39.
In the Records Division, Plaintiff would fingerprint the public, law enforcement, and juveniles. Def. SMF at ¶ 40. In the Records Division, Plaintiff conducted criminal background checks and interacted with members of the public, strangers, and law enforcement. Def. SMF at ¶ 41.
Plaintiff served in the Army from April 7, 2010 to August 19, 2010 and from March 3, 2011 to March 6, 2011. Def. SMF at ¶ 127. In 2017, while she was working as a Service Clerk, Plaintiff was formally diagnosed with and began treatment for military related post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD") through the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA"). Pl. SMF at ¶ 1.
Sheriff's Service Clerks wore uniforms in [*10]  2019 and policy required Plaintiff to comply with the grooming and appearance standards for civilian employees. Def. SMF at ¶ 42. Plaintiff considered working at a law enforcement agency safe whether day or night. Def. SMF at ¶ 43. Sheriff's Service Clerks perform all of their workplace duties indoors and not outdoors, and none of Plaintiff's duties as a Sheriff's Service Clerk involved working outdoors. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 44-45. Plaintiff and Sheriff's Service Clerks worked mandatory overtime. Def. SMF at ¶ 46.
As a Sheriff's Service Clerk, Plaintiff parked in an employee parking lot. Def. SMF at ¶ 47. Plaintiff entered the CCSO through an employee entrance. Def. SMF at ¶ 48. Plaintiff could and did park in the handicap space in the parking lot. Def. SMF at ¶ 49. Plaintiff and all other CCSO employees undergo a security screen prior to entering the CCSO building. Def. SMF at ¶ 50. Plaintiff clocked-in after entering the CCSO building and clocked-out before exiting the CCSO building. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 51-52. Visitors enter the CCSO through a visitor entrance and all visitors undergo a security screen prior to entering the CCSO building. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 53-54.
In 2018 and 2019, Plaintiff took [*11]  leave under the FMLA for various reasons. Def. SMF at ¶ 55. Plaintiff was recertified for intermittent FMLA leave on February 12, 2019. Def. SMF at ¶ 56. Under her intermittent FMLA certification in 2019, Plaintiff could take FMLA leave for doctor's appointments, flare-ups, and incidents. Def. SMF at ¶ 57. Sheriff Hill did not have any knowledge of Plaintiff's FMLA use. Def. SMF at ¶ 58.
The clerical division suffered a backlog requiring a complete reorganization of the division. Def. SMF at ¶ 59. On April 3, 2019, Personnel Order 2019-17 reorganized the clerical staff under a paramilitary chain of command. Def. SMF at ¶ 60. Sheriff Hill announced this to all employees in an email that same day:
Let me clarify this order so that there is no misunderstanding. All clerks now answer to this new chain of command which comes under Captain Moen only. Any sworn personal [sic] that has a complaint or request of a clerk will go through this new chain of command and shall not attempt to circumvent this unless they are willing to be subjected to severe disciplinary action. If a clerk is given an order by any shift supervisor it is to be followed without fail. Failure to do so will result in severe [*12]  disciplinary action. It does not matter if it is a shift supervisor is on a different shift or not. Shift supervisors authority is the same across the board since they will cover or work over on other shifts. Clerks are no longer allowed to attend roll call and will report straight to their assignments on time.
Def. SMF at ¶ 61; Pl. Dep. at 145-47, Ex. 7. Plaintiff received Sheriff Hill's email announcement. Def. SMF at ¶ 62.
Pursuant to Personnel Order 2019-17, Sheriff Hill appointed Captain Moen to Executive Captain, Defendant Farmer to Clerical Chief Supervisor, and Rayjuanda Hardnett to Assistant Clerical Chief Supervisor. Def. SMF at ¶ 63. Sheriff Hill appointed Pamela Adamson to the position of Day Watch Supervisor, Tyrentheus Ray to the position of Evening Watch Supervisor, and Gwenevere McCord to the position of Morning Watch Supervisor. Def. SMF at ¶ 64.
On April 8, 2019, Defendant Farmer requested to move Plaintiff from Records to Warrants Evening Shift. Def. SMF at ¶ 65. Sheriff Hill approved Defendant Farmer's request to move Plaintiff from Records to Warrants Evening Shift. Def. SMF at ¶ 66. On April 9, 2019, Captain Moen informed Plaintiff of her transfer from Records to [*13]  Warrants Evening Shift effective April 13, 2019. Def. SMF at ¶ 67. Plaintiff met with Rayjaunda Hardnett and Defendant Farmer about moving shifts. Def. SMF at ¶ 68. During her meeting with Rayjaunda Hardnett and Defendant Farmer, Plaintiff discussed childcare arrangements and understood the move to be temporary. Def. SMF at ¶ 69. While Plaintiff does not dispute that, she contends that, according to Rayjaunda Hardnett, Plaintiff's move to Warrants evening shift was supposed to be temporary. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 69; Hardnett Dep. [77] at 18 ("It was just temporarily, until the backlog in records got situated, then we was going to put her back in records.").
Plaintiff then had another meeting with Defendant Farmer and the two discussed having Tyrentheus Ray walk Plaintiff to her car after her shift. Def. SMF at ¶ 70. During her second meeting with Defendant Farmer, Plaintiff did not request any accommodations. Def. SMF at ¶ 71. Later that same month, Plaintiff and her coworkers attended a staff meeting in which the new chain of command and policies and procedures were discussed. Def. SMF at ¶ 73. Employees, including Plaintiff, were reminded of adherence to the chain of command and compliance [*14]  with policies and procedures, including insubordination, workplace appearance, behavior, and customer service. Def. SMF at ¶ 74. Defendant Farmer also met with Plaintiff individually and stressed compliance with the dress and appearance policy. Def. SMF at ¶ 75.
After Plaintiff was transferred to the evening shift on April 13, 2019, she began experiencing an increased overall stress level related to having to walk to her car after dark. Pl. SMF at ¶ 5. In her Charge of Discrimination filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), Plaintiff stated the following: On April 16, 2019, I requested a reasonable accommodation, but my request was denied. Def. SMF at ¶ 76; Pl. Dep. 41-42, Ex 1 [75-1] (Plaintiff's EEOC Charge dated July 22, 2019). Defendants contend that, on or around April 23, 2019, Plaintiff represented to her supervisors that she suffered from "limitations," including (1) "hypervigilance" and (2) "interacting with strangers, especially with men and/or isolated situations." Def. SMF at ¶ 77; Pl. Dep. at 192, Ex. 8 [75-8]; Hill Dep. [80], Ex. 2, Ex. 3. Plaintiff, however, disputes that she ever stated that she "suffered from limitations," and contends that she [*15]  submitted a letter from her doctor that stated that hypervigilance and interactions with strangers were "[a]n ongoing focus in treatment" of her post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD"). Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 77; Pl. SMF at ¶ 6; Pl. Dep. at 192-96, Ex. 8 [75-8].
On April 23, 2019, Plaintiff sent an email to Captain Richard Moen, Derrick Farmer, Rayjaunda Hardnett, Pamela Adamson, and Tyrentheus Ray that attached a letter dated April 15, 2019 from her medical providers stating:
Ms. Gay2 began treatment in the Trauma Recovery Program in January 2017. She is currently receiving ongoing evaluation, management, and treatment for trauma related symptoms incurred during service in the Army Reserves. Treatment includes psychiatric care and individual therapy for depression and anxiety. An ongoing focus in treatment has been hypervigilance including difficulty being out after dark and interactions with strangers, especially with men and/or isolated situations. It is reasonable to infer recent changes in work duties, i.e. working after sunset and/or alone in an office while interacting with strangers and the general public, is likely to increase overall stress level and may need to be considered in [*16]  regards to supporting this veteran's gainful employment.
Pl. SMF at ¶ 6; Def. SMF at ¶ 78; Pl. Dep., Ex. 8 [75-8]. Plaintiff indicated that the letter from her medical provider did not require her to only work during the day. Def. SMF at ¶ 80.
Ms. Hardnett forwarded this letter to her supervisors for assistance with how to address Plaintiff's request:
Clerk Williams sent this letter from her physician to include some of the reasons her present job duties and her work schedule is interfering with her medical conditions. I spoke with Clerk Williams and informed her that in order to better assist her I will need to notify you to see if there is anywhere in the Sheriff's Office that she could work. I am unclear of where Clerk Williams is wanting to work because no matter where she works in the agency she will work around men, strangers, and sometimes she may even be alone. I advised her that until we receive a direct order from you she will have to remain where she is.
Def. SMF at ¶ 81; Pl. SMF at ¶ 8; Hill Dep. at 110, Ex. 2, Ex. 3, Ex. 10.
Plaintiff then met with Ms. Hardnett and Defendant Farmer. Def. SMF at ¶ 82. Tyrentheus Ray would walk with Plaintiff to her car after she clocked out [*17]  so that she would not be alone. Def. SMF at ¶ 83.
According to Defendants, on April 23, 2019, Sheriff Hill instructed Captain Moen to get a fitness for duty form from Plaintiff and her medical provider to determine her exact workplace limitations because Plaintiff's ability to work shifts, work independently, work with male coworkers, and ability to interact with members of the public are essential functions of the Sheriff Services Clerk position. Def. SMF at ¶ 82; Pl. SMF at ¶ 10; Hill Dep. at 110, Ex. 2, Ex. 10. Plaintiff disputes this, contending that Sheriff Hill did not instruct Captain Moen to determine her workplace limitations; instead, Sheriff Hill sent an email to Ms. Hardnett, copying Captain Moen and the rest of the chain of command, stating: "Do a fit for duty status and release her [Plaintiff] from employment. Unfortunately we do not have any positions that can accommodate this." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 84; Pl. SMF at ¶ 9; Hill Dep. at 110-12, Ex. 10 [80-9].
On June 13, 2019, Plaintiff was given instructions by Captain Moen to attend a fitness for duty exam. Def. SMF at ¶ 85. On June 19, 2019, Plaintiff underwent the fitness for duty and the form was provided to the CCSO. Def. [*18]  SMF at ¶ 86. The fitness for duty outlined Plaintiff's restrictions as: (1) "No working after dark — only work during daylight hours" and (2) "Limited contact with male strangers." Def. SMF at ¶ 87; Pl. SMF at ¶ 15; Hill Dep. Ex. 2, Ex. 13. Human Resources ("HR") sent an email on June 19, 2019, to Captain Moen reporting those restrictions, and the email from HR also stated:
This is an Americans With Disabilities Act Amendment Act issue. Please advise if the Department can accommodate these restrictions. The law requires us to evaluate our ability to accommodation [sic]; however, accommodations that are costly or those that significantly alter business practices are not required. If accommodations are not made, it is the responsibility of the employer to document why.
Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 15-16.
Plaintiff contends that she was not aware of the results of her fitness for duty examination, and she was not aware that HR had made any requests for accommodations on her behalf. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 17-18. It is undisputed that Plaintiff continued working in her evening shift position without HR's suggested accommodations and without any complaint about her job performance until she was placed on unpaid leave [*19]  on June 21, 2019. Pl. SMF at ¶ 25.
On June 20, 2019, Sheriff Hill sent an email to Captain Moen stating:
We cannot accommodate this. We do not have the manpower to escort one employee to and from their car after dark unless we pay overtime. We cannot afford this. At the Sheriff's Office the majority of the employees are males and the majority of the inmates we supervise are males. Not to mention males come in the building to conduct business. There is no where we have [for her] to work to meet the needs of our agency that we can keep her away from males. We cannot afford to pay someone to constantly be there with her if she is in the presence of a male.
Def. SMF at ¶ 88; Pl. SMF at ¶ 19; Hill Dep. at 134, Ex. 2 [80-2], Ex. 13 [80-12].
Defendants contend that Sheriff Hill sent that email after he had reviewed Plaintiff's restrictions from her fitness for duty report. Def. SMF at ¶ 88. Plaintiff disputes that, and contends that Sheriff Hill testified that he never even saw the results of her fitness for duty evaluation. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 88; Hill Dep. at 116-36 (when asked if he reviewed the "fit-for-duty examination" that was conducted on Plaintiff, Sheriff Hill responded, "Not that I [*20]  recall.").
On June 21, 2019, Tyrentheus Ray informed Plaintiff she was not in compliance with the dress code. Def. SMF at ¶ 89. On that same day, Ms. Hardnett sent an email to Sheriff Hill that Plaintiff's hair was not a "natural color" and she may be in violation of CCSO regulations. Pl. SMF at ¶ 20. Within hours, Sheriff Hill ordered that Plaintiff be placed on administrative leave without pay "pending the outcome of an investigation on her insubordination." Pl. SMF at ¶ 21. After learning of Plaintiff's conduct, Sheriff Hill directed Captain Moen to investigate Plaintiff's potential insubordination and failure to follow policies and procedures. Def. SMF at ¶ 90. Captain Moen assigned the investigation to Defendant Farmer, who conducted the investigation. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 91-92. Farmer obtained statements from Plaintiff, Assistant Chief Hardnett, Supervisor Tyrentheus Ray, and Clerk Ashley Gunn. Def. SMF at ¶ 93.
On June 25, 2019, Plaintiff provided Farmer a written statement explaining her conduct, stating:
On June 21, 2019, I was assigned to the Evening Watch Shift for the Warrants Department . . . . Later on in the shift I recall Supervisor [Tyrentheus] Ray asking to speak with me [*21]  in the GCIC room . . . . Supervisor Ray began to read to me about the rules and regulations, specifying the hair color. He had two areas where they were highlighted in green. After I was counseled on the standards of compliant and told that I would need to change my hair color, I immediately took ownership of me not being in compliance that day, and advised my supervisor that I was trying to locate my wig that morning so that I could be in order . . . . That morning, I had to prioritize my time, either to continue looking for my hair piece and be lead, or head to work and be on time. I felt that getting to work on time was more of a priority.
Def. SMF at ¶¶ 94-95; Pl. Dep. at 217-33, Ex. 12; Hill Dep. Ex. 17 [80-16].
Farmer made a written report of his investigation and summarized the investigation as follows:
On Friday, June 21, 2019, Captain R. Moen assigned an investigation to me, Chief Clerical Supervisor Derrick Farmer, regarding possible misconduct by Clerk Brittani Williams. It is alleged that Clerk Brittani Williams was instructed in a Clerical Staff meeting on April 17, 2019 the Sheriff's Office Rules and Regulations on grooming standards. On June 21, 2019, Clerk Williams reported [*22]  to work in violation of the Sheriff's Office Rules and Regulations.
Def. SMF at ¶¶ 96-97; Hill Dep., Ex. 17.
In his report, Defendant Farmer also wrote:
Assistant Chief Clerical Supervisor Hardnett originally notified me around 2 p.m. on Friday, June 21, 2019, that Clerk Brittani Williams was possibly violating policy due to her hair being died [sic] bright red. I asked her to bring it to the attention of Supervisor Tyrentheus Ray so he can start the disciplinary process as he is her immediate supervisor. Supervisor Ray made contact with Clerk Williams who stated to him that she was aware that her hair was out of policy by being colored bright red and that she would begin wearing a wig to correct it. Assistant Chief Clerical Supervisor Hardnett further notified Sheriff Victor Hill that the Clerical Supervisors had special meetings with the Clerical Staff on a subject of appearance. During the meetings, Section 4.04 of Rules and Regulations, was discussed which concerns the personal appearance of the Clerical Staff. The meeting for the Second Shift was April 17, 2019 at 1 p.m. which Clerk Williams confirmed that she was in attendance.
Def. SMF at ¶ 98; Hill Dep., Ex. 17.
Based on his investigation, [*23]  Defendant Farmer found Plaintiff violated CCSO Rules and Regulations 04.04 and 07.32. Def. SMF at ¶ 99. Defendant Farmer further found that Plaintiff had violated the following rules: (1) 07.05(b)(d) Adherence to Laws; (2) 07.06 Prohibition Against Conduct Unbecoming an Officer/Representative of Sheriff; (3) 07.15 Prohibition Against Neglect of Duty; (4) 07.18 Requirement that Employees Complete All Tasks Assigned to Them; (5) 07.15 Prohibition Against Neglect of Duty; and (6) 07.32 Respect to be Shown to Lawful Orders. Def. SMF at ¶ 100.
For 07.05(b)(d) Adherence to Laws, Defendant Farmer concluded that "Clerk Williams was required to strictly obey and properly execute any lawful order issued by any supervisor of higher rank or classification" and "[s]he failed to do so by violating Rule 04.04." Def. SMF at ¶ 101. For 07.06 Prohibition Against Conduct Unbecoming an Officer/Representative of Sheriff, Defendant Farmer found that "Clerk Williams displayed conduct unbecoming an officer by displaying conduct which the agency deems as negative or unprofessional in nature. The red hair color was unprofessional in nature." Def. SMF at ¶ 102.
For 07.15 Prohibition Against Neglect of Duty, Defendant Farmer concluded that [*24]  "Clerk Williams failed to perform properly the duties of a clerk as required by Sheriff's Office rule or regulation, or which they are reasonably expected to perform by virtue of their office or position in the Sheriff's Office." Def. SMF at ¶ 103. For 07.18 Requirement that Employees Complete All Tasks Assigned to Them, Defendant Farmer concluded that "Clerk Williams knew by her own admission that she was out of compliance but continued to perform her duties out of compliance with all Sheriff's Office and bureau/divisional rules, regulations, policies, and procedures." Def. SMF at ¶ 104. For 07.32 Respect to be Shown to Lawful Orders, Defendant Farmer found that "Clerk Williams would appear to be causing an incident of insubordination, insolence, refusal to obey or an attempt to circumvent lawful orders by knowingly violating Sheriff's Office Rules and Regulations by ignoring the instruction given to her by her supervisors and the Sheriff's Office Rules." Def. SMF at ¶ 105.
As a result, Defendant Farmer concluded:
Clerk Williams was properly instructed by the entire Clerical Supervisory Staff by way of a staff meeting on April 17, 2019 that she was to maintain a professional appearance [*25]  as outlined in Rules and Regulation 4.04. Failure to abide by those instructions has led to Clerk Williams being deemed insubordinate under Rules and Regulations 07.32.
Def. SMF at ¶ 106; Hill Dep., Ex. 17 at 7-8.
On June 26, 2019, Plaintiff received a "Letter of Intent to Discipline" from Farmer, which stated:
It has come to our attention that you have made requests for accommodations within the Sheriff's Office for the position which you are currently holding. Some of the requests you have made we are able to reasonably able [sic] to accommodate. However, some of the requests are not reasonable to accommodate and therefore pose a problem for the Sheriff's Office. Your request to not work around strangers or men is unreasonable as most of the Inmates, Deputies and males [sic]. Additionally, dealing with the public poses a problem as well as half of the public are male. There is no place within the Sheriff's Office where you can work without male contact, e.g., your supervisor, and his supervisor. I am sorry to say that we cannot accommodate that request.
Pl. SMF at ¶ 22; Def. SMF at ¶ 110; Moen Dep. at 154-59, Ex. 23.
In that letter, Farmer also accused Plaintiff of violating the CCSO [*26]  personal hygiene policy by coming to work on June 21, 2019 with "bright red hair." Pl. SMF at ¶ 23. The day after Plaintiff received the notice of intent to discipline, June 27, 2019, Plaintiff provided a written response to the notice of intent to discipline. Def. SMF at ¶ 111; Pl. Dep. at 217-33, Ex. 12, Ex. 13; Hill Dep., Ex. 2, 17. Plaintiff did not provide any pictures or photographs to Defendant Farmer during the investigation or after she was issued the notice of intent to discipline. Def. SMF at ¶ 112.
Captain Moen reviewed Defendant Farmer's investigation and reported his findings to Sheriff Hill as follows:
I have completing [sic] reviewing the investigation of Clerk Brittani Williams for failing to obey the Sheriff's Office Rules and Regulations, section 04.04 by reporting to work at the Sheriff's Office with her hair colored red which is out the recommendations given in the Rules and Regulations. Clerical Chief Farmer completed the investigation and during the interview Clerk Williams owned up to reporting to work knowing she was out of policy. This action is viewed as insubordination towards her supervisors who had recently given instruction at a clerical meeting.
Def. SMF [*27]  at ¶ 107; Hill Dep., Ex. 2, 17.
Based on the findings reported to him, Sheriff Hill made the decision to terminate Plaintiff for insubordination. Def. SMF at ¶ 108; Hill Dep. at 101, Ex. 2, 17. While Plaintiff does not dispute that Sheriff Hill testified that he terminated her employment for insubordination, she contends that he actually terminated her because of her disability and her request for a reasonable accommodation. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 108. According to Defendants, Defendant Farmer had previously issued a warning to Plaintiff and all clerks about compliance with policy and procedure, including dress code, and Plaintiff still violated the policy after receiving a warning. Def. SMF at ¶ 109; Hill Dep. at 101, Ex. 2, 17.
Although Plaintiff does not dispute that she had been advised of the policy, she disputes that her hair color was in violation of the personal hygiene policy. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 109; Harris Decl. [92-2] at ¶¶ 4-9. Traci Harris, a former deputy at the CCSO, frequently came to work with her dyed red and while she had "frequent, direct interactions with Sheriff Hill," he never disciplined Harris for her hair color. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 26-29; Harris Decl. at ¶¶ 4-9. Plaintiff [*28]  contends that she came to work on dyed hair on numerous occasions prior to her suspension, yet she was not disciplined for doing so until Sheriff Hill received HR's suggested accommodations on June 19, 2019. Pl. SMF at ¶ 30; Pl. Decl. at ¶¶ 14-15.
Plaintiff also contends that both Moen and Farmer testified that she was treated "differently" from other employees who were similarly accused of violating the hygiene policy. Pl. SMF at ¶ 42; Moen Dep. at 158; Farmer Dep. at 123. Defendants dispute that, contending that Plaintiff's cited testimony from Moen and Farmer does not specifically mention the "hygiene policy." Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 42. When Captain Moen was asked whether he believed that Sheriff Hill disciplined Plaintiff "in line with how he disciplined other clerks or was she treated more harshly or less harshly," he responded, "I would say she was—she was treated differently." Moen Dep. at 158. During Farmer's deposition, after a discussion of how the personal hygiene policy was enforced against other employees, Plaintiff's attorney stated, "So it appears then, that Ms. Williams was treated differently than these previous employees who had violated the personal hygiene policy, right?" [*29]  Farmer Dep. at 123. Farmer responded, "I—I would—I would agree to that." Id.
On June 28, 2019, Captain Moen delivered a "Letter of Termination" to Plaintiff, which stated:
After review of the facts surrounding your request for accommodations and subsequent conduct on June 21, 2019 it is the determination of the Sheriff that your employment with the Sheriff's Office be terminated immediately.
Pl. SMF at ¶ 24; Moen Dep. at 151-54, Ex. 22.
It is undisputed that Sheriff Hill terminated Plaintiff. Def. SMF at ¶ 113. Defendants contend that Sheriff Hill terminated Plaintiff for two independent reasons: (1) violations of policy, including insubordination, and (2) the fitness for duty results, specifically the inability of the CCSO to provide Plaintiff with constant oversight or limited interaction with male strangers. Def. SMF at ¶ 114; Hill Dep. at 51, 64-65, Ex. 2. Although Plaintiff does not dispute that Sheriff Hill testified that he terminated her for those reasons, she contends that he actually terminated her because of her disability and her request for an accommodation. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 114.
No other CCSO or County employee terminated Plaintiff. Def. SMF at ¶ 115. Plaintiff testified [*30]  that her supervisor "does not determine whether or not I am hired or fired. That comes from whomever that the sheriff—he makes the decision." Def. SMF at ¶ 116; Pl. Dep. at 258, 284. Plaintiff never had any discussions with Sheriff Hill about PTSD, and Sheriff Hill never told Plaintiff that her termination was because of PTSD. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 117-18. Plaintiff never discussed her FMLA leave with Sheriff Hill, and Sheriff Hill never told Plaintiff that her termination was because of her taking intermittent FMLA leave. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 119-20. Plaintiff is suing Captain Moen because he coordinated her fitness for duty, investigated her violation of workplace rules, and communicated her termination to her. Def. SMF at ¶ 121. Sheriff Hill has terminated other clerks for insubordination. Def. SMF at ¶ 122.
Plaintiff contends that she could have, and would have, continued to work in her Service Clerk position had she not been terminated on June 28, 2019, provided that the CCSO continued to allow her to use FMLA leave as needed to address her PTSD symptoms. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 31, 34; Pl. Decl. at ¶¶ 26, 30, 31. Defendants contend, however, that Plaintiff's fitness for duty evaluation found that she [*31]  could not perform the essential functions of her job. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 31. Sheriff Hill decided, without even speaking to Plaintiff, that HR's suggested restrictions could not be accommodated. Pl. SMF at ¶ 32; Hill Dep. at 108-09, 142-45. According to Plaintiff, the accommodations requested by HR were not the only potential accommodations that could have addressed her limitations, and even without those accommodations suggested by HR, she would have preferred to continue working instead of being fired. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 33-34; Pl. Decl. at ¶¶ 27, 31.
On July 22, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC alleging disability discrimination and retaliation. Def. SMF at ¶ 123; Pl. Dep. at 41-42, Ex. 1. In her EEOC Charge, Plaintiff stated the following:
On April 16, 2019, I requested a reasonable accommodation, but my request was denied. On June 13, 2019, I was informed that I needed to do a fit-for-duty evaluation. On June 21, 2019, I was placed on administrative leave without pay pending an investigation. On June 28, 2019, I was discharged.
Def. SMF at ¶ 124; Pl. Dep. at 41-42, Ex 1.
Plaintiff claims that she needed an accommodation for her PTSD. Def. SMF at ¶ 125. Plaintiff [*32]  testified that she never told her supervisors that she needed to work the day shift to continue working as a Sheriff's Services Clerk. Def. SMF at ¶ 126; Pl. Dep. at 275 ("I'm not saying that I couldn't work. It's preferable that I would be on a day shift because, like I said before, that was my intention of going back to the day shift.").
Plaintiff ended her military service due to a back injury, degenerative back disease, that she suffered while in basic training. Def. SMF at ¶ 128. Plaintiff has filed for disability-related benefits or increased benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") for multiple reasons and several times since her discharge. Def. SMF at ¶ 129. Plaintiff received several disability ratings from the VA. Def. SMF at ¶ 130. First, on August 9, 2013, Plaintiff received a combined disability rating of 20%. Def. SMF at ¶ 131. Second, on July 1, 2015, Plaintiff received a combined disability rating of 30%. Def. SMF at ¶ 132. Third, on May 25, 2017, Plaintiff applied and received an increased disability rating of 80%. Def. SMF at ¶ 133. Finally, Plaintiff applied for, and received, an increased disability rating of 100%, the highest level of disability [*33]  rating. Def. SMF at ¶ 134. While Plaintiff does not dispute this, she contends that she filed "this final appeal for increased VA disability benefits on August 18, 2019 . . . because CCSO told her they terminated her because her disability could not be accommodated." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 134; Pl. Decl. [92-1] at ¶¶ 23-24.
On June 19, 2019, Plaintiff underwent an examination at the VA to apply for an increased disability rating and unemployability benefits. Def. SMF at ¶ 135. On August 1, 2019, the VA denied Plaintiff's request to increase her disability rating. Def. SMF at ¶ 136; Pl. SMF at ¶ 35. Plaintiff then retained a law firm to apply for an increased disability rating from the VA as well as VA Individual Unemployability Benefits. Def. SMF at ¶ 137; Pl. SMF at ¶ 36. As part of her application for VA Individual Unemployability Benefits that she signed on August 18, 2019, Plaintiff represented that on June 21, 2019, she "became too disabled to work."3 Def. SMF at ¶ 141; Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 141; Pl. SMF at ¶ 37. Plaintiff also represented that she had not tried to obtain employment since becoming too disabled to work. Def. SMF at ¶ 142. Plaintiff also certified for the purpose of determining [*34]  her eligibility for VA benefits that she was unable to secure or follow any substantially gainful occupation. Def. SMF at ¶ 143; Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 143.
On October 28, 2019, Plaintiff filed an appeal of the decision regarding her disability rating through her legal counsel. Def. SMF at ¶ 139. On December 7, 2019, Plaintiff then filed an amended claim for benefits and for VA Individual Unemployability Benefits. Def. SMF at ¶ 140. On March 31, 2020, the VA increased Plaintiff's disability to 100%, effective as of August 30, 2019. Def. SMF at ¶ 144; Pl. SMF at ¶ 39. Plaintiff also applied to the Social Security Administration ("SSA") for Social Security Disability Insurance ("SSDI"). Def. SMF at ¶ 145.
FedEx hired Plaintiff for a warehouse position which she held for one day before resigning. Def. SMF at ¶ 146. Aside from her one day working at FedEx, Plaintiff has not worked. Def. SMF at ¶ 147. In discovery, Plaintiff did not produce any documents or evidence related to job applications or her job search following her termination from the CCSO. Def. SMF at ¶ 148. Plaintiff testified that she could work either day or night. Def. SMF at ¶ 149; Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 149; Pl. Dep. at [*35]  31. Defendants contend that Plaintiff testified that she still needs to work in a "secure area" with other people around, and a "controlled environment." Def. SMF at ¶¶ 150-53; Pl. Dep. at 31-32 ("[I]f there is a case where I have to work, like, a night position, I could work it, you know, just have to be somewhere that is secure where there's a lot of people or whatever, so it's, you know, I could still work day or night. I just have to have certain things in place, you know, for me to work those positions. . . . For example, a secure area like when we come to work, more secure area where it's just the employee parking. . . . [I]t's doable, you know, if I'm in a controlled environment with—there are people around."). Plaintiff disputes this and contends that she stated that she prefers to work in a secured area and controlled environment, but she does not require it. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 150-53; Pl. Dep. at 275-77.
B. Discussion
1. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is authorized when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter [*36]  of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 175, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); Bingham, Ltd. v. United States, 724 F.2d 921, 924 (11th Cir. 1984). The movant carries this burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The court must view the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.
Once the moving party has adequately supported its motion, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party must "go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmoving party's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
If a fact is found to be material, the court must also consider the genuineness of the alleged factual dispute. Id. An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Id. at 249. A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is [*37]  such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. at 248. Moreover, for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 587 (quoting First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968)). Thus, the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict: "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 259.
When considering motions for summary judgment, the court does not make decisions as to the merits of disputed facts. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249; Ryder Int'l Corp. v. First Am. Nat'l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, the court only determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried. Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those that are not. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do not resolve or affect the outcome of a suit will not properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id.
2. Plaintiff's Claims
a. ADA Claims against Sheriff Hill
In Count [*38]  Four of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint [54], Plaintiff asserts a claim for "Violation of the ADA Against Defendant Hill in his Official Capacity as Sheriff of Clayton County, Georgia." Sec. Am. Compl. [54] at 14, ¶¶ 62-72. Plaintiff first alleges that she "was a qualified individual with a disability in that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation." Id. at ¶ 66. Although Count Four is asserted as a single count, Plaintiff alleges that Sheriff Hill violated the ADA in three separate ways. First, she alleges that Sheriff Hill violated the ADA by failing to reasonably accommodate her disability. Id. at ¶ 67. Second, she alleges that Defendant Hill violated the ADA by terminating her employment because of her disability. Id. at ¶ 68. Third, she alleges that Sheriff Hill violated the ADA by terminating her in retaliation for her requests for reasonable accommodations. Id. at ¶ 69.
(1) Eleventh Amendment Immunity
Sheriff Hill first argues that he is entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment on Plaintiff's ADA and FMLA claims brought against him in his official capacity.4 Defs. Br. [83-2] at 2-8. The Eleventh Amendment provides that:
The Judicial power of the United States shall not [*39]  be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.
U.S. Const. Amend. XI.
This provision prohibits suits against a state in federal court brought by its own citizens as well as by citizens of another state. See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842 (1890); see also Abusaid v. Hillsborough Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 405 F.3d 1298, 1303 (11th Cir. 2005) ("Although, by its terms, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar suits against a state in federal court by its own citizens, the Supreme Court has extended its protections to apply in such cases."); DeKalb County Sch. Dist. v. Schrenko, 109 F.3d 680, 687 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (the Eleventh Amendment constitutes an "absolute bar" to suits against a state by its own citizens). Thus, as a general rule, "[t]he Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution bars federal courts from entertaining suits against states." Abusaid, 405 F.3d at 1302; see also Stevens v. Gay, 864 F.2d 113, 114 (11th Cir. 1989) ("The Eleventh Amendment insulates a state from suit brought by individuals in federal court unless the state either consents to suit or waives its Eleventh Amendment immunity.").
As a consequence, "in the absence of consent[,] a suit in which the State or one of its agencies or departments is named as the defendant is proscribed by the Eleventh Amendment." Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984); see also Stephens v. Ga. Dep't of Transp., 134 F. App'x 320, 324 (11th Cir. 2005). However, the immunity provided by the Eleventh Amendment is not absolute: it "is no bar . . . where (1) the state consents to suit in federal court, or (2) where Congress has abrogated [*40]  the state's sovereign immunity." Alyshah v. Georgia, 239 F. App'x 473, 474 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing Port Auth. Trans—Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U.S. 299, 304 (1990)). When exercising its power to enforce provisions such as the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Congress may abrogate state sovereign immunity to suit. See Ala. State Conference of N.A.A.C.P. v. Alabama, 949 F.3d 647, 654 (11th Cir. 2020).
This general limitation on federal jurisdiction also extends to actions brought against a state's "agencies or departments." Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp., 465 U.S. at 100; see also Manders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir. 2003) ("It is also well-settled that Eleventh Amendment immunity bars suits brought in federal court when the State itself is sued and when an 'arm of the State' is sued."). Thus, the Eleventh Amendment bars any private claims against a State or one of its agencies in federal court, unless Congress abrogates the immunity conferred by the Eleventh Amendment pursuant to a valid exercise of its power or the State waives its immunity and consents to suit. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Fla., 517 U.S. 44, 72-73, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp., 465 U.S. at 98-100; Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781, 98 S. Ct. 3057, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1114 (1978); see also Grizzle v. Kemp, 634 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir. 2011) (the Eleventh Amendment does not bar jurisdiction when a state "waives its sovereign immunity or its immunity is abrogated by an act of Congress under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment").
An assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity essentially challenges a court's subject matter jurisdiction: "The Eleventh Amendment restricts the judicial power under Article III, and Article I cannot be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed on federal jurisdiction." Seminole Tribe of Fla., 517 U.S. at 72-73. Thus, the issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity must be resolved before a court may address the merits of the underlying claims. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94-101, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998) (courts [*41]  must have Article III jurisdiction before addressing merits of action); see also Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 678, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974) (an "Eleventh Amendment defense sufficiently partakes of the nature of a jurisdictional bar" such that the courts have made clear that it can be raised at any point during the litigation).
Because a suit for damages against a state official acting in his official capacity is in effect a suit against the state treasury, the Eleventh Amendment also bars suits for monetary damages against state employees acting in their official capacities. See Edelman, 415 U.S. at 663-664. The Eleventh Amendment does not, however, insulate state officials acting in their official capacities from prospective injunctive relief under certain circumstances. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908); see also Edelman, 415 U.S. at 664-71; Stevens, 864 F.2d at 114. As the Supreme Court held in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-160, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908), injunctive relief may be available against a state official acting in his official capacity, even when the Eleventh Amendment would prohibit action directly against the state for the same relief. Young functions as a narrow exception to the general rule of state immunity and permits suit only against a state official directly for prospective equitable relief to end a continuing violation of federal law. Florida Ass'n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v. Fla. Dept. of Health and Rehab. Serv., 225 F.3d 1208, 1219 (11th Cir. 2000).
As discussed, the Eleventh Amendment bars any suit against a State or a state official in federal court unless the State has waived its immunity or otherwise [*42]  consented to the suit, or Congress has abrogated that immunity. The State of Georgia has specifically reserved its sovereign immunity for suits brought in federal court pursuant to the Georgia Tort Claims Act (the "GTCA"), O.C.G.A. §§ 50-21-20 et seq. See O.C.G.A. § 50-21-23(b) ("The state does not waive any immunity with respect to actions brought in the courts of the United States."). Moreover, although the ADA states that it abrogates Eleventh Amendment immunity from suits arising under its provisions, the Supreme Court has held that, while Congress clearly intended to abrogated the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity under Title I of the ADA, the purported abrogation was invalid. See Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 367-68 (2001) (Congress did not validly abrogate states' Eleventh Amendment immunity for employment-related lawsuits under Title I of the ADA).
Thus, employment discrimination claims brought in federal court against states or state agencies under Title I of the ADA remain barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Further, although the Supreme Court has not directly addressed whether employment discrimination actions brought against States under other titles of the ADA, such as Title II and Title V, are likewise subject to Eleventh Amendment immunity in federal court, several courts have determined that Garrett's reasoning extends to such actions. See Clifton v. Ga. Merit Sys., 478 F. Supp. 2d 1356, 1368 (N.D. Ga. 2007) (Title II); [*43]  Lucas v. State of Ala. Dep't of Pub. Health, No. 3:15CV941-WKW, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9420, 2016 WL 335547, at *4 (M.D. Ala. Jan. 7, 2016), report & rec. adopted by 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9192, 2016 WL 344965 (M.D. Ala. Jan. 27, 2016) (collecting authority as to Title V); see also Demshki v. Montieth, 255 F.3d 986, 988 (9th Cir. 2001) (concluding that Garrett's "holding necessarily applies to claims brought under Title V of the ADA, at least where . . . the claims are predicated on alleged violations of Title I").
In this case, Plaintiff's ADA claims include claims of failure-to-accommodate and discriminatory termination because of disability, which arise under Title I of the ADA, and retaliation, which arises under Title V. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112, 12203. Garrett did not expressly discuss retaliation claims under Title V of the ADA, and it appears that the Eleventh Circuit has not yet addressed this issue. Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit and the majority of the lower courts that have reached the question have found that Garrett "necessarily applies to claims brought under Title V [when] the claims are predicated on alleged violations of Title I." Demshki v. Monteith, 255 F.3d 986, 988 (9th Cir. 2001). The Ninth Circuit reasoned that:
There is nothing in the ADA's legislative findings demonstrating a pattern of discrimination by states against employees who oppose unlawful employment discrimination against the disabled. Absent a history of such evil by the states, Congress may not abrogate the states' [*44]  Eleventh Amendment immunity from Title V claims. See Garrett, 121 S.Ct. at 967-68.
Id. at 989.
In this case, Sheriff Hill argues that, because he is an official of the State of Georgia or an "arm of the State," Plaintiff's ADA claims asserted against him in his official capacity are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Defs. Br. at 2-3. Further, Sheriff Hill argues, the Eleventh Circuit has held that a court must weigh four factors to determine whether a defendant is considered an arm of the State entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and those factors support a finding of immunity in this case. Id. at 3 (citing Manders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir. 2003) (en banc)). The four Manders factors are: "(1) how state law defines the entity; (2) what degree of control the state maintains over the entity; (3) where the entity derives its funds; and (4) who is responsible for judgments against the entity." Manders, 338 F.3d at 1309. This determination must be "assessed in light of the particular function in which the defendant was engaged when taking the actions out of which liability is asserted to arise." Id. at 1308.
According to Defendants, courts in the Eleventh Circuit "routinely find Georgia constitutional officers, like Sheriff Hill, act as arms of the state when overseeing employment and jail administration functions." Defs. Br. at 4 (citing Purcell ex rel. Est. of Morgan v. Toombs Cty., Ga., 400 F.3d 1313, 1325 (11th Cir. 2005); Manders, 338 F.3d at 1315 (finding Georgia [*45]  sheriff's "authority and duty to administer the jail in his jurisdiction flows from the State, not [the county]"); Pellitteri v. Prine, 776 F.3d 777, 780-83 (11th Cir. 2015) (hiring and firing sheriff's deputies is a state function)).
The Eleventh Circuit's decision in Pellitteri v. Prine, 776 F.3d 777, 778-83 (11th Cir. 2015), is especially instructive, because that case involved a former Deputy Sheriff in Lowndes County who asserted claims under the ADA against the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office and the Sheriff of Lowndes County in both his individual capacity and official capacity. Pellitteri, 776 F3d at 778-79. The Sheriff had filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiff's ADA claims against him in his official capacity were barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and the District Court denied the Sheriff's motion to dismiss. Id. at 779. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that the Sheriff was acting as an "arm of the State" when he made employment decisions and thus was immune under the Eleventh Amendment from plaintiff's ADA claims. Id. at 783.
Sheriff Prine's primary argument on appeal is that the District Court erred when it denied him immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution. According to Sheriff Prine, his law enforcement powers all derive from the State of Georgia, and the State has exclusive authority and control over the duties and affairs of his office. Thus, Sheriff Prine [*46]  argues that he acts as an "arm of the State" when exercising his power to hire and fire the deputies that enforce the laws of Georgia on his behalf. We agree.
Id. at 779.
The Pelliterri Court examined all four of the Manders factors in making its conclusion. See id. at 779-83. With respect to the first factor, how state law defines the entity, the Court held that, although sheriffs are labeled as "county officers" in the Georgia Constitution, sheriffs are only "county officers" because "they have a limited geographic jurisdiction," but "sheriffs in Georgia derive their power and duties from the State, are controlled by the State, and counties cannot, and do not, delegate any law enforcement power or duties to sheriffs." Id. at 780 (quoting Manders, 338 F.3d at 1313). Further, the Court found, "the authority of sheriffs to employ personnel is also derived from the State." Id.
Turning to the second Manders factor, what degree of control the state maintains over the entity, the Pellitteri court found that "the State of Georgia exercises substantial control over a sheriff's personnel decisions, especially in the hiring and firing of deputies. . . . As a result, even if the State generally stays out of a sheriff's day-to-day decisions about who to hire or fire, the State [*47]  still maintains a great deal of control." Id. at 781-82. With respect to the third factor, where the entity derives its funds, the Court noted that counties bear "the major burden of providing funds to the sheriff's office," but found that not to be dispositive, "because it is the State that mandates that counties set a budget for the sheriff's office," and the county "cannot dictate how the sheriff spends those funds." Id. at 782.
Finally, as to the fourth factor, who is responsible for judgments against the entity, the Court held that neither the State nor the County will be required to directly pay for any adverse judgment against the Sheriff's office; any adverse judgment against the Sheriff would be paid out of the budget of the Sheriff's Office, which is composed of both County and State funds. Id. at 783. "Nevertheless, to the extent that the state treasury will be spared here from paying any adverse judgment, this factor weighs in favor of denying immunity." Id. In sum, the Court held that "the first three factors here weigh in favor of immunity, while the fourth factor weighs against immunity," and as a result, "Sheriff Prine enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity" on the ADA claims brought against him in his official capacity. [*48]  Id.
In response to the Defendants' argument that the Eleventh Amendment provides immunity to Sheriff Hill on Plaintiff's ADA claims, Plaintiff argues that, because Sheriff Hill removed this case from the Superior Court of Clayton County, Georgia, he waived his Eleventh Amendment immunity. Pl. Br. [92] at 22-23. In support of this argument, Plaintiff cites to Lapides v. Board of Regents of University System of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 620, 122 S. Ct. 1640, 152 L. Ed. 2d 806 (2002), in which the Supreme Court held that "the State's action joining the removing of this case to federal court waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity." Lapides, 535 U.S. at 624. The Court reasoned that "removal is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal court's jurisdiction sufficient to waive the State's otherwise valid objection to litigation of a matter (here of state law) in a federal forum." Id.
What Plaintiff conveniently ignores, however, is that the Lapides decision expressly stated that its ruling was limited to claims arising under state law for which the State had explicitly waived immunity: "It has become clear that we must limit our answer to the context of state-law claims, in respect to which the State has explicitly waived immunity from state-court proceedings." Id. at 617; see also Stroud v. McIntosh, 722 F.3d 1294, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 2013). Thus, the Lapides ruling does not apply to claims brought under federal law, such as Plaintiff's ADA claims in this case. See Stroud, 722 F.3d at 1300 (" [*49] Lapides's holding expressly does not control" those cases in which "the state removes a case involving a valid federal law claim or where the state has not relinquished its immunity from suit in its own courts"); see also Estes v. Wyo. Dep't of Transp., 302 F.3d 1200, 1204 (10th Cir. 2002) ("In limiting its holding to state-law claims, Lapides does not squarely answer whether the mere act of removing federal-law claims waives a State's sovereign immunity in federal court.").
In Stroud v. McIntosh, 722 F.3d 1294 (11th Cir. 2013), the Eleventh Circuit discussed the Lapides decision, and noted that the "contrast between Lapides's narrow holding and its broad reasoning has sparked a debate in other circuits." Stroud, 722 F.3d at 1300. The Stroud court found that "[m]ost circuit courts seem to agree that the Lapides Court's reasoning should apply in cases involving federal law claims as well as those involving state law claims. That is, the source of a plaintiff's claim against a state (state law or federal law) is irrelevant to whether a state waives its immunity against that claim by removing to federal court." Id. (collecting cases); see also Estes, 302 F.3d at 1205-06 (holding that the Wyoming Department of Transportation waived sovereign immunity as to the plaintiff's ADA claims when it removed the case to federal court, noting that "The Supreme Court has consistently held that [*50]  a State waives its sovereign immunity when it voluntarily appears in federal court.").
Nevertheless, the Stroud court noted, the "circuits divide over the meaning of Lapides's second limitation—that it does not control cases in which the state has not relinquished its sovereign immunity in its own courts against the claim in question." Stroud, 722 F.3d at 1300. The court noted that three circuits, the Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth, interpreted the "broad reasoning" in Lapides "to establish the general rule that a state's removal to federal court constitutes a waiver of immunity, regardless of what a state waived in its own courts." Id. However, three other circuits, the First and Fourth Circuits and the D.C. Circuit, have held "that a state did not waive sovereign immunity by removing a case because, unlike Georgia in Lapides, the state had not waived its immunity in its own courts." Id.
Finally, the Stroud court noted that two other circuits, the Third and Fifth, "occupy something of a middle ground." Id. (citing Lombardo v. Penn. Dep't of Pub. Welfare, 540 F.3d 190 (3d Cir. 2008); Meyers ex rel. Benzing v. Texas, 410 F.3d 236 (5th Cir. 2005)).
These courts conclude that Lapides's reasoning informs the answer to the question of whether a state has waived its immunity-based objection to suit in a federal forum—and only that question. But sovereign immunity, they say, [*51]  encompasses more than this narrow immunity from federal jurisdiction; specifically, a state that waives its forum-based immunity may still have immunity from liability for particular claims. That underlying immunity from liability is unaffected by the state's voluntary invocation of the federal forum.
Id. at 1300-01 (internal citations omitted).
It was this "middle ground" that the Stroud court held that the Eleventh Circuit would follow. Id. at 1301 ("We hold that although the Board's removal to federal court waived its immunity-based objection to a federal forum, the Board retained its immunity from liability for a violation of the ADEA [Age Discrimination in Employment Act]."). The court reasoned that "[t]he Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that sovereign immunity is a flexible defense with multiple aspects that states can independently relinquish without affecting others," and that "sovereign immunity can include immunity from suit as well as immunity from liability, depending on a state's choices in fashioning the scope of its immunity." Id.
So, under Lapides's reasoning, a state waives its immunity from a federal forum when it removes a case, which voluntarily invokes the jurisdiction of that federal forum. But nothing in Lapides suggests that [*52]  a state waives any defense it would have enjoyed in state court—including immunity from liability for particular claims. Lapides specifies that it is addressing only immunity to a federal forum. . . . In fact, the opinion distinguishes this immunity against federal court proceedings from a state's "underlying sovereign immunity,"—implying that its discussion of immunity from federal court does not address other aspects of sovereign immunity, including a state's immunity from liability. . . . We do not understand Lapides to require the state to forfeit an affirmative defense to liability simply because it changes forums. But the Lapides Court's reasoning supports the propositions that a state consents to federal jurisdiction over a case by removing and that it cannot then challenge that jurisdiction by asserting its immunity from a federal forum. We therefore hold that the Board waived its immunity from suit in federal court when it removed the case.
Id. at 1302 (internal citations omitted).
The Stroud court then applied this newly adopted rule to the case at hand, in which the plaintiff had asserted a claim of age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621, et seq., along with other claims, against the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles. Id. at 1296. The [*53]  district court held that the Board was immune from liability under the ADEA and it did not waive that immunity when it removed the case to federal court, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that "[t]he Board's removal of the case did not waive its constitutional objection to ADEA liability on the basis of sovereign immunity." Id. at 1297, 1303-04.
In sum, the Court finds that, while Plaintiff incorrectly cites to Lapides to support her argument that Sheriff Hill waived his Eleventh Amendment immunity on her ADA claims when he removed this case from the Superior Court of Clayton County, Georgia, the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Stroud supports a finding that he indeed waived his right to claim Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court. See Stroud, 722 F.3d at 1300-02. To the extent that Sheriff Hill would be able to invoke sovereign immunity as a defense to liability generally under the Plaintiff's ADA claims, however, Stroud holds that he did not waive that defense. See id.
In this case, Defendants argue only that Sheriff Hill is immune from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment. See Defs. Br. at 2-8. They do not argue that sovereign immunity provides Sheriff Hill immunity from liability on Plaintiff's ADA claims, regardless of whether Plaintiff had brought her claims [*54]  in state court or federal court. Furthermore, in Defendants' reply brief, they do not respond to Plaintiff's argument that Sheriff Hill waived Eleventh Amendment immunity when he removed this case to federal court, and in fact, they do not even address Eleventh Amendment immunity or sovereign immunity at all. See Defs. Reply Br. [100]. Thus, it appears that Defendants have implicitly conceded that Sheriff Hill has waived Eleventh Amendment immunity on Plaintiff's ADA claims, and that he cannot otherwise assert a sovereign immunity defense to liability on those claims.
Even if Sheriff Hill had attempted to assert a defense of immunity to liability on Plaintiff's ADA claims, however, such an attempt may have been futile. In Williamson v. Department of Human Resources, 572 S.E.2d 68 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002), the Georgia Court of Appeals held that, because Georgia had waived sovereign immunity for claims of disability discrimination under state law brought by state employees, Georgia had also waived sovereign immunity as to claims of disability discrimination brought under federal law by state employees. Williamson, 572 S.E.2d at 681. Thus, because Georgia had enacted the Fair Employment Practices Act ("FEPA"), O.C.G.A. §§ 45-19-21, et seq., which prohibited discrimination against state employees on the basis of disability, the Court of Appeals reasoned, it could not claim sovereign [*55]  immunity as a defense to claims brought by state employees under the ADA:
Because, in the FEPA, the state by legislative act waived its sovereign immunity as to state disability discrimination claims by its employees, the state may not selectively cloak itself in sovereign immunity as to federal disability discrimination claims by its employees. To do so would discriminate against federally based rights which the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution of the United States forbids states to do. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting the Department's motion and dismissing Williamson's ADA claim on the basis that the claim was barred by sovereign immunity.
Id. at 681-82 (emphasis in original, footnote omitted); see also Jones v. Georgia Dep't of Corr., No. 1:07-cv-1228-RLV, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22142, 2008 WL 779326, *6 (N.D. Ga. March 18, 2008) (Vining, J.) ("[I]t is clear that after Williamson the State of Georgia may be sued in a Georgia state court for disability discrimination claims based on federal law.").5
In sum, Sheriff Hill has waived his Eleventh Amendment immunity to Plaintiff's ADA claims in federal court, and he has asserted no sovereign immunity defense to liability on Plaintiff's ADA claims generally. As noted above, the Eleventh Amendment does not provide immunity to state officials acting in their official capacities from prospective injunctive [*56]  relief under certain circumstances. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908); see also Scott v. Taylor, 405 F.3d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir. 2005) ("official capacity suits for prospective relief to enjoin state officials from enforcing unconstitutional acts are not deemed to be suits against the state and thus are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment"). In this case, Plaintiff specifically seeks prospective injunctive relief by requesting an order requiring Defendants to reinstate her to her former position at the CCSO. See Sec. Am. Compl. at 15-16. Thus, even if Sheriff Hill had not waived Eleventh Amendment immunity by removing this case to this Court, Plaintiff's ADA claim against him in his official capacity would not be barred, to the extent she is seeking reinstatement or other prospective injunctive relief.6
(2) Standards of Proof under the ADA
The ADA was enacted "to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities" and "to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101(b)(1), (b)(2). Title I of the ADA, which covers disability discrimination in employment, prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability [*57]  in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001). This section of the ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (Carnes, J.) (quoting Harding v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F.Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)).
The definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of that individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity").
In general, the burden of proof for a claim of disability discrimination under the ADA is based on the framework established by the Supreme Court [*58]  in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), for employment discrimination cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq. See Durley v. APAC, Inc., 236 F.3d 651, 657 (11th Cir. 2000) (McDonnell Douglas framework generally applies to disability discrimination claims under the ADA); see also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 50 n.3, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003) (reviewing disparate treatment disability claim under McDonnell Douglas framework and noting that courts of appeals use this framework in disparate treatment ADA cases); Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007), Bennett v. Dominguez, 196 F. App'x 785, 791 (11th Cir. 2006).
Under this framework, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, a plaintiff may establish a claim under the ADA by first presenting a prima facie case through circumstantial evidence of discrimination under the same burden-shifting analysis used in Title VII employment discrimination cases. Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1242; see also Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999). If a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of a disability, the burden would shift to the defendant to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action, such as termination. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004).
If, however, the employer successfully articulates a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the action, the plaintiff must then establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a discriminatory intent motivated the employer's action. Roberts v. Gadsden Mem'l Hosp., 835 F.2d 793, 796 (11th Cir.), opinion amended on reh'g, 850 F.2d 1549 (11th Cir. 1988) (citing McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; Perryman v. Johnson Products Co., 698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir. 1983)). A plaintiff may carry this burden either indirectly, by showing [*59]  that the defendant's proffered explanation is pretextual, or directly, by showing that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the defendant's action. Id. (citing Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256; Perryman, 698 F.2d at 1142). "By successfully meeting this burden, the plaintiff creates a presumption that the adverse employment action was the product of discriminatory intent." Id.
For those cases in which an employee claims that an employer violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability, however, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting framework does not apply because a plaintiff is not required to prove intentional discrimination in those cases. See Nadler, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *9 ("An employer must reasonably accommodate an otherwise qualified employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship in the operation of the business. . . . Thus, applying McDonnell Douglas to reasonable accommodation cases would be superfluous, since there is no need to prove discriminatory motivation.") (emphasis in original); see also Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (in an ADA failure to accommodate case, there are no additional burdens on defendant to show that it had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff [*60]  or on plaintiff to establish that defendant's proffered reasons were pretextual); Jones v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, No. 1:07-cv-1228, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22142, 2008 WL 779326, *6 (N.D.Ga. March 18, 2008) (Vining, J.) ("The Eleventh Circuit came to the logical conclusion that the McDonnell Douglas test does not apply to reasonable accommodation claims").
(3) Disability Discrimination under the ADA
As discussed, in Count Four of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she "was a qualified individual with a disability in that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation," and that Sheriff Hill committed a "violation of the ADA." Sec. Am. Compl. [54] at 14, ¶ 66. Plaintiff alleges that Sheriff Hill violated the ADA by failing to reasonably accommodate her disability and by terminating her employment because of her disability. Id. at ¶¶ 67-68. Thus, in both of these claims, Plaintiff claims that Sheriff Hill discriminated against her because of her disability in violation of the ADA.
In order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must generally demonstrate that: (1) she has a disability as defined in the ADA; (2) she is a "qualified individual," meaning that, [*61]  with or without reasonable accommodations, she can perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007); Rossbach v. City of Miami, 371 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (11th Cir. 2004); Witter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998). In addition, a plaintiff must also establish that her employer had actual knowledge of her alleged disability or regarded her as disabled. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assoc., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910-911 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 447-48 (11th Cir. 1996).
Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA because, they argue, she cannot show that she was a "qualified individual" under the ADA, and she cannot show that she suffered an adverse action because of her disability. According to Defendants, Plaintiff is not a "qualified individual" because, they argue, Plaintiff cannot show that she could perform the essential functions of her position. Defendants also argue that Plaintiff is estopped from arguing that she could perform the essential functions of her position because she contended in her VA disability application that she was unable to work. Further, Defendants argue, Plaintiff cannot show that Sheriff Hill denied her a reasonable accommodation because she failed to identify a reasonable accommodation that would allow her to perform her job, [*62]  and Plaintiff also cannot show that her termination was because of her disability.
(a) Does Plaintiff Have a Disability?
The first prima facie element requires the plaintiff to show that she has a disability as it is defined under the ADA. The ADA defines "disability" as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities . . . ; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C). Thus, a person has a "disability" under the ADA if the person has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment by an employer. See Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)).
In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") amended the ADA in 2008 to further provide that, for the purpose of establishing the existence of a "disability," "a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B).7 The ADAAA also provides that "[t]he definition of disability in this Act [*63]  shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under this Act, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this Act." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A). Thus, it is clear that a major purpose of the ADAAA was to amend the ADA to make it easier for plaintiffs to establish that a serious medical condition is covered as a disability under the ADA. "[B]y enacting the ADAAA in 2008, Congress eased in part the evidentiary burden on ADA plaintiffs," and "announced that 'the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis.'" Vaughan v. World Changers Church Int'l, Inc., No. l:13-CV-0746-AT, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912, 2014 WL 4978439 (N.D.Ga. Sept. 16, 2014) (Totenberg, J.) (quoting Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014)); see also Coker v. Enhanced Senior Living, Inc., 897 F.Supp.2d 1366, 1374 (N.D.Ga.2012) (Story, J.) ("The ADAAA amended the ADA to, among other things, promulgate a more liberal standard of the term 'disabled,' making it significantly easier for a plaintiff to show disability." (internal quotation omitted)).
In this case, it appears that Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish that she has a disability, as that term is defined under the ADA. See Defs. Br. at 12 ("Defendants challenge the second and third elements of Plaintiff's claims showing Plaintiff cannot establish the elements of her prima facie case for either [*64]  category of disability discrimination.").
(b) Is Plaintiff a "Qualified Individual"?
The second element of the prima facie case requires a plaintiff to establish that he or she is a "qualified individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA defines the term "qualified individual" as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987); Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 278 (11th Cir. 1994).
The Eleventh Circuit follows a two-step approach to determining when a disabled person is otherwise qualified. Reed v. Heil Co., 206 F.3d 1055, 1062 (11th Cir. 2000). First, the court determines whether the person has the requisite qualifications for the positions, such as sufficient experience and skills, education, and any appropriate licenses. Id. Second, the court assesses whether the person can perform the essential functions [*65]  of the job in question, either with or without a reasonable accommodation. Id.; see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987).
In this case, Defendants do not argue that Plaintiff did not have the proper qualifications for the position, but only that she could not perform the essential functions of the position. Essential functions are the fundamental job duties of the employment position and do not include marginal functions. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); see also Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2001). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes: (1) the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential; (2) written job descriptions; (3) the amount of time spent performing the particular function; and (4) the consequences of not requiring the job holder to perform the function. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000).
In determining what functions of a given job are deemed to be essential, "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment . . . and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. The regulations also state three factors that make it more likely that a specific duty [*66]  is an essential function of the job: (1) the reason the position exists is to perform the function; (2) there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of the job function can be distributed; and (3) the function is highly specialized so that the person holding the position was hired for his or her ability to perform the particular function. See Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1526 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i)-(iii)).
"Courts consider the employer's judgment regarding whether a function is essential, as well as (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the individual to perform the function, (3) the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of individuals who held the job in the past, and (5) the work experience of individuals currently in similar jobs." Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 927-28 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1257-58 (11th Cir. 2007)).
Thus, an employee must show that she is able to meet all of a job's requirements, despite any disability, in order to establish a valid ADA claim. See Southeastern Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable [*67]  accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). If a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of her job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then she is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA. See Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).
In this case, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot show that she was a qualified individual because, they argue, the evidence demonstrates that she was not able to perform the essential functions of her job. Defs. Br. at 17-18. In particular, Defendants argue, "Plaintiff should be estopped from asserting she is qualified based on her representations to the VA." Id. at 17. According to Defendants, "a plaintiff may be estopped from asserting that she is a qualified individual under the ADA if she already applied for and received disability benefits." Id. (citing Williams-Evans v. Advance Auto Parts, 843 F. App'x 144, 147 (11th Cir. 2021)). If a plaintiff made a previous sworn statement asserting that she is disabled and unable to work, the "court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary elements of an ADA claim" before allowing her claim to proceed. Id. (quoting Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 807, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999)).
In response, Plaintiff argues that the two cases cited by Defendants [*68]  in support of their "estoppel" argument involve representations made in an application for Social Security Disability benefits, not VA disability benefits. Pl. Br. at 21. Plaintiff argues further that the facts related to her application for increased VA disability benefits "do not estop her from demonstrating she could have performed the duties of her Service Clerk position with or without accommodation." Id. at 19. Plaintiff contends that she had a VA disability rating of 80% since May of 2017, and after that, "she successfully performed the duties and responsibilities of her Service Clerk position until the CCSO suspended her on June 21, 2019." Id. Therefore, she argues, "the record is undisputed" that she was able to perform the essential functions of her position, with or without accommodation, with an 80% VA disability rating. Id. at 19-20.
She argues further that she has not made any representations to the VA that are inconsistent with her representations in this case. According to Plaintiff, she applied for an increased disability rating related to her PTSD in May of 2019, but after her termination, on August 1, 2019, the VA denied this request and left her PTSD disability rating [*69]  at 70%. Id. at 20. Plaintiff contends that she believed she qualified for an increased disability rating because the CCSO terminated her employment on the grounds that her PTSD could not be accommodated, and on August 18, 2019, she filed an appeal seeking a higher VA disability rating, in which she indicated that she last worked, and she became too disabled to work, on June 21, 2019, the date the CCSO placed her on unpaid leave. Id. Based on these representations, on March 31, 2020, the VA assigned her disability rating of 100% effective August 30, 2019. Id.
Judicial estoppel "is applied to the calculated assertion of divergent sworn positions. The doctrine is designed to prevent parties from making a mockery of justice by inconsistent pleadings." McKinnon v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Ala., 935 F.2d 1187, 1192 (11th Cir. 1991) (quoting American Nat'l Bank v. Federal Dep. Ins. Corp., 710 F.2d 1528, 1536 (11th Cir. 1983)); see also Talavera v. Sch. Bd. of Palm Beach Cty., 129 F.3d 1214, 1217 (11th Cir. 1997).
With respect to a plaintiff who has applied for disability benefits with the Social Security Administration ("SSA"), it is well-settled law that merely applying for SSA disability benefits does not preclude a plaintiff from pursuing a claim under the ADA, although in order to prevail on an ADA claim, the plaintiff must show that she could perform the essential functions of her position, with or without an accommodation. [*70]  In Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999), one of the cases cited by Defendants in support of their estoppel argument, the Supreme Court explained that an application for Social Security Disability Insurance ("SSDI") benefits would not create even a "strong presumption" against a plaintiff's success under the ADA:
We believe that, in context, these two seemingly divergent statutory contentions are often consistent, each with the other. Thus pursuit, and receipt, of SSDI benefits does not automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim. Nor does the law erect a strong presumption against the recipient's success under the ADA. Nonetheless, an ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore her SSDI contention that she was too disabled to work. To survive a defendant's motion for summary judgment, she must explain why that SSDI contention is consistent with her ADA claim that she could "perform the essential functions" of her previous job, at least with "reasonable accommodation."
Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 797-98.
As Plaintiff notes, however, the Cleveland decision applied to SSDI benefits, not VA disability benefits. See id. More importantly, the Cleveland decision also stated that a person's act of merely applying for SSDI benefits, without being 61 awarded benefits, should [*71]  not be considered unduly prejudicial to any claim brought under the ADA, because plaintiffs are entitled to pursue alternative theories of relief:
[I]f an individual has merely applied for, but has not been awarded, SSDI benefits, any inconsistency in the theory of the claims is of the sort normally tolerated by our legal system. Our ordinary Rules recognize that a person may not be sure in advance upon which legal theory she will succeed, and so permit parties to "set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically," and to "state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(e)(2). We do not see why the law in respect to the assertion of SSDI and ADA claims should differ.
Id. at 805.
Nevertheless, the court explained that, when a plaintiff has successfully applied for benefits and provided a sworn statement of total disability to the SSA, she must explain the apparent inconsistency with her ADA claim:
When faced with a plaintiff's previous sworn statement asserting "total disability" or the like, the court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary elements of an ADA claim. To defeat summary judgment, [*72]  that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff's good-faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless "perform the essential functions" of her job, with or without "reasonable accommodation."
Id. at 807.
In this case, it is undisputed that Plaintiff applied to the SSA for SSDI benefits, but Defendants do not contend that she applied before her employment with the CCSO was terminated, and it also appears to be undisputed that she did not receive SSDI benefits. See Def. SMF at ¶ 145. Defendants argue in their reply brief that the SSA only rejected Plaintiff's application for SSDI benefits because of the income Plaintiff received from her VA disability benefits. Defs. Reply Br. [100] at 7-8. Under the holding in Cleveland, however, a plaintiff is allowed to pursue differing claims for relief under different theories, and her SSDI application does not preclude her from pursuing a claim under the ADA, particularly when she was never awarded SSDI benefits.
Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit has also held that applying for social security disability benefits does not preclude a plaintiff from pursuing a claim under [*73]  the ADA, because the SSA does not take into consideration whether a reasonable accommodation would permit the plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her position:
We agree with the majority of our sister circuits that a certification of total disability on an SSD benefits application is not inherently inconsistent with being a "qualified individual with a disability" under the ADA. A certification of total disability on an SSD application does mean that the applicant cannot perform the essential functions of her job without reasonable accommodation. It does not necessarily mean that the applicant cannot perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation. Whether in any particular situation there is an inconsistency between applying for SSD benefits and bringing an ADA claim will depend upon the facts of the case, including the specific representations made in the application for disability benefits and the nature and extent of the medical evidence in the record. However, we do hold that an ADA plaintiff is estopped from denying the truth of any statements made in her disability application. Our basis for this holding is that an ADA plaintiff should not [*74]  be permitted to disavow any statements she made in order to obtain SSD benefits.
Talavera v. Sch. Bd. of Palm Beach Cty., 129 F.3d 1214, 1220 (11th Cir. 1997).
In the second case cited by Defendants to support their argument of estoppel, Williams-Evans v. Advance Auto Parts, 843 F. App'x 144 (11th Cir. 2021), an unpublished case from last year, the Eleventh Circuit applied the rule set forth in Cleveland to find that a plaintiff who had applied for social security disability benefits in 2012, two years before working for the defendant employer, was estopped from asserting that she was a qualified individual under the ADA because her specific statements to the SSA about her abilities contradicted her statements in the ADA case about her ability to perform her job:
Williams-Evans asserts in her ADA claim that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with Advance, but her position before the Social Security Administration tells a different story. In September of 2012, she submitted a sworn application for Social Security disability benefits stating that she had been "unable to work" since June 22, 2012. Though she started working for Advance in 2014, she never updated or revised this application to reflect that she was no longer disabled. In fact, on January 4, 2016, she testified at a hearing before a Social Security Administration [*75]  Administrative Law Judge that she was unable to lift more than five or six pounds, must lie down for 30 minutes every hour, and could only stand or sit for 20 to 25 minutes. Based on this evidence, the ALJ found that she had been disabled since October 1, 2012 and awarded her disability benefits retroactive to that date.
Williams-Evans, 843 F. App'x at 147.
The court went on to state that the plaintiff was required to explain why her statements about her abilities before the Social Security Administration were consistent with her ADA claim, but she failed to do so. Id. at 147-48 ("She did not explain how she could be disabled yet still able to perform the essential functions of her sales position."). But the court did not focus merely on the plaintiff's application for benefits, but her specific testimony before the SSA about her ability to perform her job:
These statements to the Social Security Administration are inconsistent with her position in this case that she could perform essential functions of her job with Advance. Her job required that she install car batteries, clean the store, and man the cash register—all while "predominantly walking or standing." Yet her position before the Social Security Administration was that she [*76]  was unable to sit or stand for more than 20 to 25 minutes, and that she must lie down for 30 minutes every hour.
Id. at 147.
In this case, however, Defendants do not cite any particular sworn statements from Plaintiff about her ability to perform her job, other than noting that she applied for VA disability benefits and signed a general statement that she was "disabled." See Defs. Br. at 17-18. Furthermore, although Defendants do not cite to any cases in their opening brief indicating that an application for VA disability benefits would similarly be subject to an estoppel argument, they contend in their reply brief that their estoppel argument would apply equally to a claim for VA disability benefits, but they cite only to an unpublished case from the Northern District of Alabama. Defs. Reply Br. at 6-7 (citing Chancey v. Fairfield S. Co., No. 2:11-CV-3609-VEH, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123422, at *3 (N.D. Ala. Aug. 29, 2013)).
In any event, even assuming that Defendants are correct that their estoppel argument would apply equally to Plaintiff's application for VA disability benefits, the Court finds that they have failed to show that Plaintiff is estopped from claiming that she was a "qualified individual" for the purpose of her ADA claim. First, as the Supreme Court stated in Cleveland, a plaintiff must have applied [*77]  for, and received disability benefits, during the relevant time period of employment before a court may consider whether the plaintiff's statements to the SSA (or in this case, VA) may estop her from also claiming that she was a qualified individual under the ADA. See Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 805.
In this case, it is undisputed that Plaintiff both applied for, and received VA disability benefits while she was still employed at the CCSO, but at the time her employment was terminated, she was rated at 80% disability. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 129-33. While the VA ultimately increased Plaintiff's disability rating to 100%, it appears to be undisputed that this did not occur until March 31, 2020, well after Plaintiff's employment had been terminated in June of 2019. See Def. SMF at ¶ 144. Plaintiff contends that, although the VA rated her 100% disabled on March 31, 2020, the 100% rating was effective as of August 30, 2019, which was still months after her employment was terminated. See Pl. SMF at ¶ 39. Thus, it is undisputed that Plaintiff was not receiving 100% VA disability benefits at any time when she was actively employed by the CCSO, and Defendants' estoppel argument fails for that reason alone.
Defendants argue that Plaintiff [*78]  applied for a 100% disability rating at some time in May of 2019 while she was still employed by the CCSO, but they have failed to include any specific details regarding that application in their Statement of Facts, nor cite to any record evidence. In the parties' Statements of Fact, they dispute the timeline that she applied for total disability, and dispute the date that she claimed to be totally disabled. Defendants contend that Plaintiff signed an application for VA Individual Unemployability Benefits on "August 18, 2018," and represented that she "became too disabled to work" on "June 6, 2021." Def. SMF at ¶ 141. Plaintiff disputes that and contends that she actually applied for additional VA benefits on August 18, 2019, and represented that she "became too disabled to work" on June 21, 2019. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 141; Pl. SMF at ¶ 37. As discussed above, the records filed by Defendants indicate that Plaintiff is correct. See Notice of Filing Records under Seal [105] at Records000036-38 (Plaintiff's application for VA benefits was signed on August 18, 2019, and the date she stated that she "became too disabled to work" was June 21, 2019, the date she was placed on unpaid leave).
 [*79] Because Plaintiff represented that she became "too disabled to work" on June 21, 2019, the date that the CCSO placed her on unpaid leave, she argues that she did not represent that she was totally unable to work during the time she was actively working in the Service Clerk position. Pl. Br. at 14. The Court agrees. But the dispute as to this timing of an application is also immaterial. As the Supreme Court stated in Cleveland, what matters is not that Plaintiff applied for benefits, but what date she both applied for, and received benefits. Plaintiff did not receive a 100% disability rating from the VA until March 31, 2020, which Plaintiff contends was effective as of August 30, 2019, but at any rate, both of these dates are well after Plaintiff's employment at the CCSO was terminated. Thus, Defendants have failed to demonstrate that Plaintiff received 100% disability benefits during the time she was still employed by the CCSO.
Defendants have also failed to show any sworn statement or even allegation by Plaintiff pertaining to this period attesting to functional limitations contradicting her ability to perform the essential duties of her position with accommodations. As noted, the mere claim [*80]  of being disabled for purposes of social security or VA benefits does not necessarily refute a claim of being a "qualified person" under the ADA, because the ADA expressly contemplates that a disabled person may be "qualified" if reasonable accommodations would allow her to do the job despite the disability. In this case, Plaintiff claims to be a qualified person on the basis of reasonable accommodations, and Defendants do not show how such a claim is inconsistent with any sworn statement to the VA.
Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she could perform the essential functions of her position, with or without a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, she has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether she was a qualified person under the ADA.
(c) Did Sheriff Hill Fail to Provide a Reasonable Accommodation?
The third and final element of Plaintiff's prima facie case requires her to present sufficient evidence to establish that she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007)); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007). The ADA expressly provides that an employer unlawfully discriminates [*81]  against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer does not make "reasonable accommodations" for the employee, unless "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 927 (11th Cir. 2010) ("An employer impermissibly discriminates against a qualified individual when the employer does not reasonably accommodate the individual's disability.").
A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b). An employer is not required, however, to provide an employee with "the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F.Supp. 931, 947 (N.D.Ga. 1997)).
Furthermore, although the ADA lists types of possible accommodations, the fact that a particular accommodation may be included does not mean that such accommodation is automatically deemed "reasonable" under the statute. See Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998). The accommodation must also be reasonable based on the [*82]  specific facts and circumstances of the case. Id.; Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285. "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001). "In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job." Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal citation and quotation omitted).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Thus, it is the plaintiff who "bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the employee desires." Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 500 F. App'x 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86). Moreover, an employer's "duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999) ("[T]he initial burden of requesting an accommodation is on the employee. Only after the employee has satisfied this burden and the employer fails to provide [*83]  that accommodation can the employee prevail on a claim that her employer has discriminated against her."); see also Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016).
An employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify his or her limitations and possible accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). But when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id. at 1367; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 F. App'x 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) ("where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In this case, Defendants argue that Sheriff Hill provided Plaintiff with multiple reasonable accommodations for her disability. See Defs. Br. at 14. According to Defendants, Plaintiff was allowed to use intermittent FMLA leave any time she suffered from an episode related to her PTSD or if [*84]  she needed to attend medical appointments. See Def. SMF at ¶ 57. Plaintiff was also permitted to use a handicap parking space to reduce her time in the employee parking lot when arriving and leaving from work. See Def. SMF at ¶ 49. Moreover, Defendants argue, Plaintiff's request to never be alone with, or limit her contact with, males, strangers, or members of the public was not a reasonable accommodation because it would have required Sheriff Hill to eliminate essential functions of Plaintiff's position and would have caused undue hardship for the CCSO. Defs. Br. at 14-16.
In response, Plaintiff does not dispute that Sheriff Hill allowed her to use intermittent FMLA leave any time she suffered from an episode related to her PTSD or if she needed to attend medical appointments, nor does she dispute that she was permitted to use a handicap parking space to reduce her time in the employee parking lot when arriving and leaving from work. See Pl. Br. at 13-19. Plaintiff argues, however, that Sheriff Hill failed to engage in the "interactive process" to determine what other reasonable accommodations she might have requested. Id. at 16 ("Sheriff Hill failed to accommodate [her] disability [*85]  by terminating her employment instead of engaging in the required interactive process under the ADA."). According to Plaintiff, Sheriff Hill decided, without even speaking to her, that HR's suggested restrictions could not be accommodated. Id.; see Pl. SMF at ¶ 32; Hill Dep. at 108-09, 142-45.
The problem with Plaintiff's argument, however, is that, as discussed above, the Eleventh Circuit has held that an employer has no duty to engage in an "interactive process" until the employee first identifies and requests a reasonable accommodation for her disability. See Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000). The employee must first establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id. at 1367; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 F. App'x 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) ("where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In this case, the evidence indicates that the reasonable accommodations that were actually requested by Plaintiff, such as being allowed to take intermittent FMLA leave, parking in a handicap [*86]  space, and having someone walk her to her car, were all granted. See Def. SMF at ¶¶ 70, 83. Plaintiff has not identified any other reasonable accommodation that she requested, but that Sheriff Hill denied. Instead, her argument is that, instead of discussing her request for accommodations with her—or, more accurately, what she described as HR's request for accommodations on her behalf—Sheriff Hill terminated her employment. But that argument supports Plaintiff's ADA claim based on her termination, not her claim based on failure to accommodate. Indeed, Plaintiff admits that she could do her job on the evening shift without any accommodations other than being allowed to use FMLA leave, which she had been permitted to do. See Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 149; Pl. Decl. at ¶ 31. Thus, this case is really about Plaintiff's termination, not an alleged failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, because Plaintiff has admitted that she needed no additional accommodation to perform her job.
In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence to support her claim that Sheriff Hill failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS [*87]  that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA claim of disability discrimination based on a failure to accommodate.
(d) Was Plaintiff Terminated Because of her Disability?
As discussed, the third and final element of Plaintiff's prima facie case requires her to present sufficient evidence to establish that she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007)); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007).
To establish this element, Plaintiff may show that she suffered an adverse employment action and that her disability was a determining factor in that adverse action. See Haines v. Cherokee Cty., No. 1:08-CV-2916-JOF-AJB, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71544, 2010 WL 2821853, at *16 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2010) (citing Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007)), report and recommendation adopted as modified, No. 1:08-CV-02916-JOF, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71524, 2010 WL 2821780 (N.D. Ga. July 15, 2010). The ADA requires that Plaintiff show that her disability was a "but for" cause of the adverse action. McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1073-74 (11th Cir. 1996). Further, if Defendant articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for any adverse action, Plaintiff must show that the reason is pretext for unlawful disability discrimination. See Cusick v. Yellowbook, Inc., No. 1:12-CV-3466-WSD, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30896, 2014 WL 949947, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 11, 2014), aff'd, 607 F. App'x 953 (11th Cir. 2015) (citing Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1243 (11th Cir. 2001)).
An adverse employment action is an ultimate employment decision, such as discharge or failure to hire, or other conduct that alters the employee's compensation, [*88]  terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an employee. Minnifield v. City of Birmingham Dep't of Police, 791 F. App'x 86, 90 (11th Cir. 2019). In general, for an employment action to be considered an "adverse action" that triggers liability under the ADA, the law is clear that the decision must result in a material alteration on the terms of employment. See Davis v. Town of Lake Park, 245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. 2001) (in the context of a Title VII claim, "Whatever the benchmark, it is clear that to support a claim under Title VII's anti-discrimination clause the employer's action must impact the 'terms, conditions, or privileges' of the plaintiff's job in a real and demonstrable way"), overruled on other grounds by Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006); see also Kerns v. Capital Graphics, Inc., 178 F.3d 1011, 1016-17 (8th Cir. 1999) ("Minor changes in duties or working conditions that cause no materially significant disadvantage do not meet the standard of an adverse employment action"). Proof of "direct economic consequences" is not required, but a plaintiff must show "a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Minnifield, 791 F. App'x at 90 (quoting Davis, 245 F.3d at 1239 (emphasis in original)).
In this case, as part of her ADA claim of disability discrimination in Count Four, Plaintiff alleges that Sheriff Hill violated the ADA by terminating [*89]  her employment because of her disability. Sec. Am. Compl. [54] at ¶ 68. Defendants argue that Plaintiff has presented neither direct nor circumstantial evidence that her employment was terminated because of her disability. Defs. Br. at 18. Moreover, even if Plaintiff had presented a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on her termination, Defendants argue, they have presented evidence that they had a legitimate reason to terminate Plaintiff's employment that had nothing to do with her disability, and Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence that their reason was pretextual. Id. at 19-20.
In response, Plaintiff argues that the "record contains undisputed evidence of the CCSO's selective application of its personal hygiene policy. Just as this evidence could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that Hill terminated Ms. Williams in retaliation for her requesting ADA accommodations, it could also lead the same jury to conclude that Hill fired Ms. Williams because of her disability." Pl. Br. at 15-16.
Based on a review of the parties' evidence and arguments, the Court finds that Plaintiff has presented both direct and circumstantial evidence to create a genuine issue of fact [*90]  as to whether her disability played a role in Sheriff Hill's decision to terminate her employment. The evidence presented by the parties indicates that after Plaintiff was transferred to the evening shift on or around April 13, 2019, she began experiencing an increased overall stress level related to having to walk to her car after dark. Pl. SMF at ¶ 5.
On April 23, 2019, Plaintiff sent an email to Captain Richard Moen, Derrick Farmer, Rayjaunda Hardnett, Pamela Adamson, and Tyrentheus Ray and attached a letter dated April 15, 2019 from her medical providers stating that she was undergoing treatment for depression and anxiety and also stated: "An ongoing focus in treatment has been hypervigilance including difficulty being out after dark and interactions with strangers, especially with men and/or isolated situations. It is reasonable to infer recent changes in work duties, i.e. working after sunset and/or alone in an office while interacting with strangers and the general public, is likely to increase overall stress level and may need to be considered in regards to supporting this veteran's gainful employment." Def. SMF at ¶ 78; Pl. SMF at ¶ 6; Pl. Dep., Ex. 8.
According to Defendants, [*91]  on that same day that Plaintiff sent the letter, April 23, 2019, Sheriff Hill instructed Captain Moen to get a fitness for duty form from Plaintiff and her medical provider to determine her exact workplace limitations. Def. SMF at ¶ 82. But Plaintiff has presented evidence—which appears to be undisputed by Defendants—that Sheriff Hill did not instruct Captain Moen to "determine her workplace limitations." Instead, Plaintiff has presented evidence that, on April 23, 2019, Sheriff Hill sent an email to Rayjaunda Hardnett, copying Captain Moen and the rest of the chain of command, stating: "Do a fit for duty status and release her from employment. Unfortunately we do not have any positions that can accommodate this." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 84; Pl. SMF at ¶ 9; Hill Dep. at 110-12, Ex. 10 [80-9] (emphasis added).
Thus, Plaintiff has presented evidence that, later on the very same day she presented a letter from her medical providers that indicated she was undergoing psychiatric treatment for depression and anxiety, Sheriff Hill sent an email to Hardnett ordering her to "release her [Plaintiff] from employment." Sheriff Hill sent this email before Plaintiff completed a fitness for duty evaluation [*92]  on June 19, 2019, and before anyone complained about Plaintiff's red hair, which Defendants contend occurred on or around June 21, 2019. See Defs. SMF at ¶ 89. Accordingly, the Court finds that this email constitutes direct evidence that Plaintiff's disability, or her request for accommodations for her disability, or both, played a role in Sheriff's Hill decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment.
The Court also finds that Sheriff's Hill April 23 email provides, at a minimum, circumstantial evidence that he made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment well before anyone accused her of violating the hygiene policy by having dyed red hair or being insubordinate. For that reason, this email also provides evidence sufficient to create a material fact as to whether Sheriff Hill's purported "legitimate" reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment was mere pretext.
Moreover, Defendants contend that, after Sheriff Hill reviewed Plaintiff's fitness for duty report, he sent an email to Captain Moen on June 20, 2019 stating that he could not "accommodate" Plaintiff. Def. SMF at ¶ 88. But Plaintiff points out that Sheriff Hill testified that he never even saw the results of her fitness [*93]  for duty evaluation. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 88; Hill Dep. at 116-36 (when asked if he reviewed the "fit-for-duty examination" that was conducted on Plaintiff, Sheriff Hill responded, "Not that I recall."). This inconsistency also provides further evidence that Sheriff Hill's purported reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment was pretextual.
On June 26, 2019, Plaintiff received a "Letter of Intent to Discipline" from Farmer, which stated:
It has come to our attention that you have made requests for accommodations within the Sheriff's Office for the position which you are currently holding. Some of the requests you have made we are able to reasonably able [sic] to accommodate. However, some of the requests are not reasonable to accommodate and therefore pose a problem for the Sheriff's Office. Your request to not work around strangers or men is unreasonable as most of the Inmates, Deputies and males [sic]. Additionally, dealing with the public poses a problem as well as half of the public are male. There is no place within the Sheriff's Office where you can work without male contact, e.g., your supervisor, and his supervisor. I am sorry to say that we cannot accommodate that request.
 [*94] Pl. SMF at ¶ 22; Def. SMF at ¶ 110; Moen Dep. at 154-59, Ex. 23.
Defendants contend that Sheriff Hill made the decision to terminate Plaintiff for insubordination. Def. SMF at ¶ 108; Hill Dep. at 101, Ex. 2, 17. But the "Letter of Intent to Discipline" Plaintiff received from Farmer also includes a discussion of Plaintiff's alleged requests for accommodations—which came from HR, not Plaintiff—and why those accommodations could not be granted. This letter serves as further evidence that Sheriff Hill's purported reason for Plaintiff's termination was merely a pretext. Finally, it is undisputed that Sheriff Hill decided, without even speaking to Plaintiff, that HR's suggested restrictions could not be accommodated. Pl. SMF at ¶ 32; Hill Dep. at 108-09, 142-45. But as Plaintiff argues, she was already doing the job without complaint, and even without the accommodations suggested by HR, she would have preferred to continue working instead of being fired. See Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 33-34; Pl. Decl. at ¶¶ 27, 31. The Court finds that all of this evidence, especially when viewed as whole, suggests that Sheriff's Hill's reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment was pretextual.
Accordingly, for all [*95]  these reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be DENIED as to Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the ADA based on her termination.
(4) Retaliation under the ADA
In Count Four of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint [54], Plaintiff alleges that Sheriff Hill not only discriminated against her because of her disability, but she contends that he also violated the ADA by terminating her in retaliation for making requests for accommodations for her disability. Sec. Am. Compl. [54] at ¶ 69.
The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). The Eleventh Circuit has held that, because this provision creates a prohibition on retaliation under the ADA that is similar to the prohibition on retaliation found in Title VII, courts should evaluate ADA retaliation claims under the same framework used for Title VII retaliation claims. Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997); see also McNely v. Ocala Star—Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1075-77 (11th Cir. 1996) (relying on Title VII jurisprudence [*96]  to interpret meaning of ADA provisions in a retaliation case).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show the same elements generally required for a claim of illegal retaliation under Title VII: (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that there is some causal connection between the expression and the adverse employment action. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. The third element of a plaintiff's prima facie case of disability retaliation requires the plaintiff to present evidence suggesting a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. In the Title VII context, the Supreme Court has ruled that "retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation." Univ. of Tex. S.W. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013). This standard "requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer." Id. This standard is equally applicable to ADA retaliation claims. See Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016).
"Once a prima facie case is established, the burden then shifts to the defendant employer to come forward with legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for [*97]  its actions that negate the inference of retaliation." Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. If the defendant meets that burden, the plaintiff must then present evidence demonstrating that the employer's proffered legitimate reasons are merely a "pretextual ruse designed to mask retaliation." Id.; see also Isenbergh v. Knight—Ridder Newspaper Sales, Inc., 97 F.3d 436, 440 (11th Cir. 1996).
In this case, Defendants do not directly address Plaintiff's retaliation claim in their opening brief. See Defs. Br. [83-2] at 11. While they include a header that states "Plaintiff's Discrimination and Retaliation Claims under the ADA and RA the [sic] Fail," they do not discuss the elements of a retaliation claim under the ADA, nor do they present any argument that Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish the required elements. See id. In her response, Plaintiff points out that Defendants' motion does not address her retaliation claim. Pl. Br. at 6. Finally, in Defendants' reply brief, they argue that Plaintiff "lacks evidence of retaliation," and she also failed to engage in a protected activity under the ADA. Defs. Reply Br. [100] at 10-11.
The Court does not generally entertain arguments presented for the first time in a reply brief. See Int'l Telecomms. Exchange Corp. v. MCI Telecomms. Corp., 892 F.Supp. 1520, 1531 (N.D.Ga. 1995) (Hull, J.) ("Normally, a party may not raise new [*98]  grounds for granting its motion in a reply. Where a party does raise new grounds in its reply, the Court may either strike the new grounds or permit the non-moving party additional time to respond to the new argument."). But even if the Court were to consider Defendants' arguments presented in their reply, it would still find that their Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied as to Plaintiff's ADA claim for retaliation.
As explained above, the Court finds that Sheriff Hill's email to Rayjaunda Hardnett dated April 23, 2019 constitutes direct evidence of either discrimination or retaliation, or both. As discussed, on April 23, 2019, Plaintiff sent an email to her supervisors that attached a letter dated April 15, 2019 from her medical providers stating that she was undergoing treatment for depression and anxiety and also stated: "An ongoing focus in treatment has been hypervigilance including difficulty being out after dark and interactions with strangers, especially with men and/or isolated situations. It is reasonable to infer recent changes in work duties, i.e. working after sunset and/or alone in an office while interacting with strangers and the general public, is likely to [*99]  increase overall stress level and may need to be considered in regards to supporting this veteran's gainful employment." Def. SMF at ¶ 78; Pl. SMF at ¶ 6; Pl. Dep., Ex. 8.
Later that same day, April 23, 2019, Sheriff Hill sent an email to Rayjaunda Hardnett, copying Captain Moen and the rest of the chain of command, stating: "Do a fit for duty status and release her from employment. Unfortunately we do not have any positions that can accommodate this." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 84; Pl. SMF at ¶ 9; Hill Dep. at 110-12, Ex. 10 [80-9] (emphasis added). As discussed above, the Court finds that this email constitutes direct evidence that Plaintiff's disability, or her request for accommodations for her disability, or both, played a role in Sheriff's Hill decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment.
Furthermore, even if this email were not viewed as direct evidence, and it was instead considered only circumstantial evidence of Sheriff Hill's discriminatory or retaliatory intent, this email would also be sufficient for Plaintiff to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Sheriff Hill's claimed reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment was pretextual. Sheriff Hill claims that he [*100]  terminated Plaintiff for "insubordination" that occurred on or about June 21, 2019, but he sent this email ordering Hardnett to "release" Plaintiff from employment two months earlier.
In their reply brief, Defendants also argue that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation because she failed to engage in a protected activity under the ADA. Defs. Reply Br. [100] at 10-11. The first prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that she engaged in a protected expression as it is defined under the ADA. Plaintiff is not required to show that she even has an actual disability under the ADA to establish this element. See, e.g., Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 391 (4th Cir. 2001) (a claim of retaliation under the ADA "does not require that the claimant be disabled"); see also Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., 291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir. 2002) (a plaintiff need only show that he "had a good faith, reasonable belief that the employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices" in order to establish that a complaint was a protected activity under the ADA).
This element of a protected activity may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016). A plaintiff is not required to show that she has an actual disability or prove that the accommodation was reasonable under the law, but merely [*101]  that she "had a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that [s]he was entitled to [the requested] accommodations under the ADA." Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998).
Defendants argue in their reply that "Plaintiff never asked for a reasonable accommodation," and that "Plaintiff is estopped from claiming a reasonable accommodation existed and she failed to identify a reasonable accommodation. Thus, Plaintiff cannot now claim she engaged in protected activity under the ADA or RA." Defs. Reply Br. at 10-11. The Court rejects Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's request for accommodations, or the request for accommodations made on her behalf by HR, cannot constitute a protected activity under the ADA. Regardless of whether Sheriff Hill ultimately determined whether Plaintiff's requests, or HR's requests on her behalf, were reasonable, Plaintiff's request for accommodations was based on a good-faith and reasonable belief that she was entitled to accommodations for her disability. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff's request for an accommodation was a protected activity under the ADA.
Accordingly, for all these reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be DENIED as to Plaintiff's [*102]  claim of retaliation under the ADA.
b. Rehabilitation Act Claims
In Count Three of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint [54], Plaintiff alleges that both Clayton County and Sheriff Hill, in his official capacity, violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehabilitation Act"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 794, et seq. Sec. Am. Compl. [54] at ¶¶ 49-61. She alleges that the County and Sheriff Hill violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to reasonably accommodate her disability, terminating her employment because of her disability, and terminating her in retaliation for her requests for reasonable accommodations. Id. at ¶¶ 56-58.
In Plaintiff's response brief, Plaintiff states that she "has chosen to abandon all claims asserted other than her ADA and Rehab Act claims against Sheriff Hill in his official capacity." Pl. Br. [92] at 6 n.3. Thus, Plaintiff states that she has abandoned her Rehabilitation Act asserted against Clayton County. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claim against Clayton County, asserted in Count Three of the Second Amended Complaint.
In relevant part, the Rehabilitation Act states that "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation [*103]  in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); 28 C.F.R. § 41.3(e). Thus, the Rehabilitation Act prohibits employment disability discrimination by employers who receive federal funding.
Following the enactment of the ADA, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of disability by private employers, Sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act were amended to provide that the applicable standards in determining violations of the Act shall be those applied under Title I (the Employment Provisions) of the ADA. 29 U.S.C. §§ 791(g) and 794(d); see also Pritchard v. Southern Co. Servs., 92 F.3d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir.), amended on reh'g in part, 102 F.3d 1118 (11th Cir. 1996); Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827, 831-32 (3rd Cir. 1996). Accordingly, discrimination claims brought under the Rehabilitation Act are generally governed by the same standards as claims brought under Title I of the ADA. See Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 n.2 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'n of Bus. and Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 57 (4th Cir. 1995) ("To the extent possible, we adjudicate ADA claims in a manner consistent with decisions interpreting the Rehabilitation Act.").
The Rehabilitation Act also incorporates the anti-retaliation provision from the ADA. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 791(g), 793(d), 794(d); see also Burgos-Stefanelli v. Sec'y, U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 410 F. App'x 243, 245 (11th Cir. 2011). As discussed, the ADA's anti-retaliation provision is similar to Title VII's prohibition on retaliation, so the Eleventh Circuit has held that retaliation claims pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act and ADA should be analyzed under the framework used [*104]  for assessing Title VII retaliation claims. Id.; see also Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1323-24 (11th Cir. 2005); Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997).
For the same reasons discussed above in connection with Plaintiff's ADA claims, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to establish a claim for disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act based on her claim that Sheriff Hill failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability. The undersigned has also found, however, that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish claims under the Rehabilitation Act against Sheriff Hill in his official capacity for retaliation and disability discrimination based on her termination.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act against Sheriff Hill in his official capacity, to the extent that claim is based on an alleged failure to accommodate her disability, as asserted as part of Count Three. The undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be DENIED as to Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claims against Sheriff Hill in his official capacity, to the extent those claims are based on retaliation and disability discrimination [*105]  based on her termination, as asserted as part of Count Three.
c. FMLA Claims against Sheriff Hill and Clayton County
In addition to her claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiff also claims that Sheriff Hill and Clayton County violated the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq. Sec. Am. Compl. [54] at ¶¶ 42-48. In Count Two of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint [54], Plaintiff alleges that she "engaged in conduct protected by the FMLA by taking intermittent FMLA leave as necessitated by her PTSD and PTSD related symptoms," and that Sheriff Hill and Clayton County "violated the FMLA" when they terminated her employment in retaliation for her use of FMLA leave. Id. at ¶¶ 44, 47.
As noted above, Plaintiff states in her brief that she "has chosen to abandon all claims asserted other than her ADA and Rehab Act claims against Sheriff Hill in his official capacity." Pl. Br. [92] at 6 n.3. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be GRANTED as Plaintiff's FMLA claim, asserted in Count Two of the Second Amended Complaint.
d. Disability Discrimination under O.C.G.A § 34-6A-4
In Count One of the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim for "Disability Discrimination in Violation [*106]  of O.C.G.A. § 34-6A-4 Against Defendants Farmer, Moen, and Hill, Individually and in his Official Capacity as Sheriff of Clayton County, Georgia." Sec. Am. Compl. [54] at ¶¶ 152-54. She alleges that Defendants Farmer, Moen, and Hill violated O.C.G.A. § 34-6A-4 by terminating her employment due to her disability and because of her request that her disability be accommodated. Id. at ¶ 153.
As noted above, Plaintiff states in her brief that she "has chosen to abandon all claims asserted other than her ADA and Rehab Act claims against Sheriff Hill in his official capacity." Pl. Br. [92] at 6 n.3. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim under O.C.G.A § 34-6A-4, asserted in Count One of the Second Amended Complaint.

II. DEFENDANT FARMER'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant Farmer has also filed a separate Motion for Summary Judgment [79]. As explained above, the only claim Plaintiff has asserted against Defendant Farmer is her claim under O.C.G.A. § 34-6A-4, in Count One of the Second Amended Complaint. Sec. Am. Compl. [54] at ¶¶ 152-54. She alleges that Defendants Farmer, Moen, and Hill violated O.C.G.A. § 34-6A-4 by terminating her employment due to her disability and because of her request [*107]  that her disability be accommodated. Id. at ¶ 153.
As noted, Plaintiff states in her brief that she "has chosen to abandon all claims asserted other than her ADA and Rehab Act claims against Sheriff Hill in his official capacity." Pl. Br. [92] at 6 n.3. Moreover, Plaintiff has filed no response to Defendant Farmer's Motion for Summary Judgment [79], indicating that she does not oppose his request that judgment be entered in his favor as to Count One. See LR 7.1(B), NDGa. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant Farmer's Motion for Summary Judgment [79] be GRANTED and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant Farmer on Count One, the only claim Plaintiff has asserted against him.

III. RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons discussed above, IT IS RECOMMENDED that Farmer's Motion for Summary Judgment [79] be GRANTED, and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant Farmer on Count One, the only claim Plaintiff has asserted against him.
IT IS RECOMMENDED that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.
IT IS RECOMMENDED that the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim under O.C.G.A. § 34-6A-4 and Plaintiff's FMLA claim, and that judgment [*108]  be entered in favor of all Defendants on Counts One and Two of the Second Amended Complaint.
IT IS RECOMMENDED that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claim against Clayton County, asserted in Count Three of the Second Amended Complaint.
IT IS RECOMMENDED that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act based on an alleged failure to accommodate her disability, as asserted as part of Counts Three and Four.
IT IS RECOMMENDED that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] be DENIED as to Plaintiff's remaining claims of disability discrimination and retaliation under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, asserted in Counts Three and Four solely against Sheriff Hill in his official capacity.
If these recommendations are adopted in full, all claims against Defendants Clayton County, Derrick Farmer, and Richard Moen would be DISMISSED. The only claims remaining in this case for trial would be Plaintiff's claims against Sheriff Hill in his official capacity under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act for disability discrimination based on her termination [*109]  and unlawful retaliation.
As this is a Final Report and Recommendation, there is nothing further in this action pending before the undersigned. Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 31st day of January, 2022.
