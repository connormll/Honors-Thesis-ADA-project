Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is before the Court on Defendant's Motion For Summary Judgment (Doc. 58). For the reasons discussed below, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion be GRANTED.

Procedural Background
Lucretia Thomas ("Plaintiff") was formerly employed by the Cobb County School District ("Defendant" or "the District") as a Food Service Assistant ("FSA"). (Doc. 1 ¶ 12). On February 5, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against the District, John Adams in his official capacity as the Deputy Superintendent of Human Resources and Operations, Latosha Hayes-Sperling in her capacity as the FNS Human Resources and Investigations Manager, Amy Lambert in her capacity as FNS Director, Tiffany Tisdel1 in her capacity as Cafeteria Manager, and John [*2]  Does 1 through 3. (Doc. 1). Plaintiff alleged that Defendants discriminated against her because of her disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 41 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. ("ADA") (Count I) and that the District retaliated against her in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehabilitation Act") (Count II). The individual Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiff's ADA claim against them, and the Court granted that motion and also dismissed Plaintiff's claims against the John Doe Defendants, leaving only Plaintiff's claims against the District. (Docs. 30, 32).
The District has now filed a motion for summary judgment (Doc. 58) and supporting brief (Doc. 58-1), statement of undisputed material facts (Doc. 58-5) and exhibits (Doc. 58-2 thorough 58-4). Plaintiff responded to that motion with supporting brief (Doc. 64-1), response to Defendant's statement of facts (Doc. 64-2), statement of disputed material facts (Doc. 64-4), and Plaintiff's affidavit (Doc. 64-3). The District replied to Plaintiff's response (Doc. 70) and responded to Plaintiff's statement of facts (Doc. 71). With briefing complete, the undersigned now turns to the merits of Defendant's motion.

Facts [*3] 2
The facts, for summary judgment purposes only, are derived from Defendant's statement of undisputed material facts (Doc. 58-5 ("Def. SMF")); Plaintiff's response to Defendant's statement (Doc. 64-2); Plaintiff's statement of disputed material facts (Doc. 64 ("Pl. SMF")); Defendant's response to Plaintiff's statement (Doc. 71); and uncontroverted record evidence. Many of these facts are taken from the depositions of Plaintiff (Doc. 65 ("Thomas Dep.")); Tiffany Tisdel (Doc. 66 ("Tisdel Dep.")); and Plaintiff's Affidavit (Doc. 64-3 ("Thomas Aff.")). The undersigned has reviewed the record, including the parties' filings, to determine whether genuine issues of material fact exist to be tried. Yet the court need not "scour the record" to make that determination. Tomasini v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. Of Fla., 315 F. Supp. 2d. 1252, 1260 n.11 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (internal quotation omitted). In ruling on the parties' respective summary judgment motions, the facts are construed in the light most favorable to the non-movant. See Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 26 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2001).
In October 2014, the District hired Plaintiff as a Food Service Assistant ("FSA") in the Food and Nutrition Services Department of Floyd Middle School in Cobb County, Georgia. (Def. SMF ¶ 1; Pl. SMF ¶ 1). The primary function of an FSA is, generally, to perform food [*4]  service duties as assigned by the manager. (Def. SMF ¶ 3). The job description for the FSA position listed the requirements for the position, including in relevant part:
Routine physical activities that are required to fulfill job responsibilities; ability to repetitively lift items weighing a maximum of 50 pounds, walk & stand on cement floors for up to 7.5 hours, climb ladder, stoop, bend, lift and have hands in water; ability to work extended periods in temperatures ranging from extremely hot to subzero; ability to tolerate work conditions while cooking, frying in hot oil, steaming, baking and microwaving; operates equipment that poses possible risk, loss or injury; utilizes cleaning chemicals in solution, aerosol and powder forms; subject to a noisy environment; refer to page 3 for Physical Demand Categories.
(Doc. 65 at 228). The referenced Physical Demands page rated lifting 10 pounds from floor to knuckle as "continuous," i.e., 67 to 100 percent of the day; lifting 25 pounds from floor to knuckle as "frequent," i.e., 34 to 66 percent of the day; and lifting 50 pounds from floor to knuckle as "occasional," i.e., one to 33 percent of the day. (Doc. 65 at 230). The form also indicated [*5]  that lifting 12.5 pounds from waist to overhead was performed frequently and 25 pounds from waist to overhead was performed occasionally; lifting 17.5 pounds from waist to chest was performed frequently and lifting 35 pounds from waist to chest was performed occasionally; two-hand carry of 25 pounds was performed frequently; and two-hand carry of 50 pounds was performed occasionally. (Id.). The form also indicated that pushing 33.5 pounds, e.g., utility carts, baker's racks, proofing/holding cabinets, etc., and pulling 33.5 pounds were performed occasionally. (Id.). FSAs were also required to rotate stock up to 50 pounds to bring older food to the front and newer food to the back based on expiration dates on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis, one of the "Essential Duties" listed on the Job Description. (Def. SMF ¶ 7; Pl. SMF ¶ 11; Doc. 65 at 228). The lifting requirement was shared with other FSAs for bulk items, as well as employees from a temp agency who were FSAs and who performed other food service work as well. (Def. SMF ¶ 8).
During her interview for the FSA position, Plaintiff did not disclose that she had any restrictions, and at the time of hire she did not have any physical [*6]  limitations. (Def. SMF ¶ 2; Pl. SMF ¶¶ 6, 10). When Plaintiff was hired, the District reviewed the job description for the FSA with her at her orientation. (Def. SMF ¶ 9; Pl. SMF ¶ 9). Plaintiff did not tell anyone that she could not perform any of the listed duties when she reviewed the job description or during her first year at Floyd Middle School, the 2014-2015 school year or that she needed any work restrictions. (Def. SMF ¶ 10; Pl. SMF ¶ 8). When Plaintiff was hired, she was able to lift up to 50 pounds, although when she was required to lift stock that weighed 50 pounds or near 50 pounds, e.g., cases of five-pound cans, she received assistance from a male coworker or two female co-workers. (Pl. SMF ¶¶ 12, 13; Thomas Dep. 46-47, 54). Plaintiff testified that that happened once a week when deliveries came in. (Thomas Dep. 46-47). Plaintiff also testified that lifting was an "everyday item," and she estimates her job required lifting 30 percent of the time. (Thomas Dep. 53, 179). Plaintiff's duties ranged from cleaning extensively, cooking, serving as a cashier, storing cooked food, lifting heavy kitchen equipment, and putting away stock and cans, which she performed every day. [*7]  (Pl. SMF ¶¶ 4, 18).
On January 11, 2017, Plaintiff was involved in a work-related accident at school. (Pl. SMF ¶ 25). A large bowl landed on her left shoulder and left leg, injuring her. (Pl. SMF ¶ 26). Prior to the accident, Plaintiff suffered from chronic arthritis in her back and left shoulder blade. (Pl. SMF ¶ 27). Plaintiff's back and shoulder arthritis did not prevent her from carrying out her job duties from November 2014 through January 2017. (Pl. SMF ¶ 28).
In July 2017, Plaintiff was reassigned from Floyd Middle School to Riverside Primary School ("Riverside"). (Pl. SMF ¶ 22). On July 28, 2017, the Cafeteria Manager at Riverside, Tiffany Tisdel, met with Plaintiff and went over the New Food Service Employee Orientation and Food Service Checklist, including a review of the job description/evaluation form and performance expectations. (Pl. SMF ¶ 31; see also Doc. 65 at 257-259). Plaintiff told Tisdel about her problems with her shoulder and that she was treating with her doctors for her shoulder injury, but she did not then tell Tisdel that she could not perform any of the tasks listed on the job description, which were the same as when Plaintiff was at Floyd Middle School. (Pl. [*8]  SMF ¶ 32; Thomas Dep. 75-76). On January 5, 2018, Plaintiff was diagnosed with rotator cuff tears to her right and left shoulders based on an MRI. (Pl. SMF ¶¶ 38-39; Thomas Dep. 115). The last day of the 2017-2018 school year was May 24, 2018. (Thomas Dep. 171).
On June 11, 2018, Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Wheeler, wrote that it was her medical opinion that Plaintiff "need[ed] to have restrictions at work," that Plaintiff "could not lift more than 10 pounds due to chronic condition," and that "[t]hese restrictions were permanent." (Def. SMF ¶ 24; Pl. SMF ¶ 37; see also Doc. 65 at 357). On June 12, 2018, Plaintiff sent Dr. Wheeler's letter to Tisdel. (Def. SMF ¶ 25). Plaintiff alleges that Tisdel called her on June 20, 2018 and stated that she needed to resign, and she told Tisdel she did not intend on resigning. (Thomas Aff. ¶ 19). Tisdel testified that her supervisor, Phyllis Fountain, told Tisdel "that if you cannot perform the duties, then you are not allowed to work" based on Plaintiff's medical provider's letter. (Tisdel Dep. 47). Tisdel agreed that it was communicated to Plaintiff that she would not be allowed to resume her duties as FSA "[u]ntil there was doctor documentation [*9]  that said she could perform her duties." (Tisdel Dep. 49). Plaintiff suggested working in the capacity of a cashier, which would prevent her from lifting more than 10 pounds, but Tisdel refused. (Pl. SMF ¶ 44). According to an August 10, 2018 letter to Plaintiff, on June 29, 2018 the District's Benefits Department contacted Plaintiff and advised her that her medical restriction prevented her from performing the essential duties of her job. (Doc. 66 at 103). The District offered her the opportunity to resign or apply for another position for which she was qualified; however, Plaintiff indicated that she would not resign. (Def. SMF ¶ 27). On July 26, 2018, Plaintiff completed an ADA accommodations request. (Def. SMF ¶ 28). When she made the request for an ADA accommodation, school was out so Plaintiff was not working, but she was still considered an employee. (Pl. SMF ¶ 52). Plaintiff's medical care provider completed an Interactive Process Questionnaire stating that Plaintiff could not lift more than 10 pounds; that her impairment was "indefinite"; that it limited her in the major life activity of "lifting"; that Plaintiff was not "able to perform all essential job functions and physical [*10]  requirements" because she could not lift more than 10 pounds; and as a recommended reasonable accommodation, the provider wrote, "please ask coworkers to perform lifting." (Doc. 66 at 106-07). In addition to not being able to lift items over 10 pounds at work, Plaintiff was unable to lift items in her household, and her husband had to lift all household items. (Pl. SMF ¶¶ 53-54). As of July 2018, Plaintiff was not aware of any light duty positions for a food service worker. (Def. SMF ¶ 31).
On July 31, 2018, Plaintiff's ADA Accommodations request was denied on the basis that the permanent medical restriction prevented Plaintiff from performing an "essential function" of the FSA position. (Pl. SMF ¶ 47). Plaintiff alleges that during the summer 2018, she was told by various District personnel that she could not come to work with her restrictions and that if she did so, she would be sent back home. (Thomas Dep. 153-55, 180). Prior to the first day of school on August 1, 2018, Plaintiff called Latasha Sperling, the Human Resources and Investigation Manager, about going back to work and said that she has not heard back from anyone regarding various positions she applied for. (Pl. SMF ¶ [*11]  48). Sperling told Plaintiff that she had three days before she would be considered to have abandoned her job, and Plaintiff reminded her that she had been told that she was not to return to work due to the restriction. (Pl. SMF ¶¶ 49-50).
On August 10, 2018, John Adams, Deputy Superintendent, sent Plaintiff a letter informing her that the District deemed her to have voluntarily resigned from her job as a result of job abandonment. (Doc. 66 at 103). Plaintiff does not know who made the decision to terminate her or whether Tisdel had any role in terminating her. (Def. SMF ¶ 44). Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on August 15, 2018 in which she alleged that Defendant discriminated against her because of her disability in violation of the ADA. (Doc. 65 at 353). In July and August 2018, Plaintiff completed numerous applications for other positions within the District (Def. SMF ¶ 35), but she was not hired for any of those positions. For all of those applications, Plaintiff does not know who reviewed the application, whether that person knew she had filed an EEOC charge or requested an accommodation under the ADA, why [*12]  the District did not hire her, or who was hired for the position. (Def. SMF ¶ 36). Tisdel wrote in her reference for Plaintiff that Plaintiff left her employment because "[s]he [wa]s no longer able to perform the physical requirements of the particular position [FSA]." (Def. SMF ¶ 40). Tisdel's reference was otherwise favorable, rating Plaintiff as "above average" or "superior" in all the listed traits. (Def. SMF ¶ 41).

Discussion

I. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is proper "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support that assertion by[] . . . citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). The moving party has an initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also [*13]  Arnold v. Litton Loan Servicing, LP, No. 1:08-cv-2623-WSD, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119787, 2009 WL 5200292, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 23, 2009) ("The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact.") (citing Herzog v. Castle Rock Entm't, 193 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir. 1999)). If the non-moving party will bear the burden of proving the material issue at trial, then in order to defeat summary judgment, that party must respond by going beyond the pleadings, and by the party's own affidavits, or by the discovery on file, identify facts sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue for trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 324. "No genuine issue of material fact exists if a party has failed to 'make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element . . . on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.' " AFL-CIO v. City of Miami, 637 F.3d 1178, 1186-87 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322).
Furthermore, "[a] nonmoving party, opposing a motion for summary judgment supported by affidavits[,] cannot meet the burden of coming forth with relevant competent evidence by simply relying on legal conclusions or evidence which would be inadmissible at trial." Avirgan v. Hull, 932 F.2d 1572, 1577 (11th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 952 (1992); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B), (c)(4). The evidence "cannot consist of conclusory allegations or legal conclusions." Avirgan, 932 F.2d at 1577. Unsupported self-serving statements by the party opposing summary judgment are insufficient to avoid summary judgment. [*14]  See Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705, 714 (11th Cir. 1984).
For a dispute about a material fact to be "genuine," the evidence must be such that "a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted." Id. at 249-50 (internal citations omitted). It is not the court's function at the summary judgment stage to determine credibility or decide the truth of the matter. Id. at 249, 255. Rather, "[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [the nonmovant's] favor." Id. at 255.

II. Plaintiff's Claims
In Count I of her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against her in violation of the ADA by not allowing her to return to work, requesting her resignation, and terminating her because of her disability. (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 42-43). In Count II, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant retaliated against her in violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. (Id. ¶ 49). The District moves for summary judgment on both claims. (Doc. 58).

A. ADA Discrimination Claim (Count I)

1. Relevant ADA Standards
"The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating against a 'qualified individual on the basis of disability.' " McCarroll v. Somerby of Mobile, LLC, 595 Fed. Appx. 897, 899 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting [*15]  42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). Defendant argues that Plaintiff's ADA disability discrimination claim fails because, among other reasons, she has not shown that she is a qualified individual for purposes of her ADA claim. (Doc. 58-1 at 13). "To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that, at the time of the adverse employment action, [s]he had a disability, [s]he was a qualified individual, and [s]he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of h[er] disability." Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007)). "To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on a failure-to-accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she is disabled; (2) she was a 'qualified individual' when she suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) that she was discriminated against because of her disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow her to keep working." Cappetta v. North Fulton Eye Ctr., No. 1:15-CV-3412-LMM-JSA, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214906, at *69 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 1, 2017), adopted by 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214787 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 7, 2017). Thus, regardless of whether Plaintiff's ADA claim rests on her allegation that Defendant terminated her because of her disability or that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her disability, in order to survive summary judgment, Plaintiff [*16]  must at least create a triable issue of fact on whether she was a "qualified individual" under the ADA when she was terminated.
"Under the ADA, a qualified individual is an 'individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.' " Medearis v. CVS Pharm., Inc., 646 Fed. Appx. 891, 895 (11th Cir. 2016) (unpublished decision) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). "An accommodation is reasonable and necessary under the ADA 'only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job.' " Id. (quoting Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007)). "The ADA does not require an employer to eliminate essential functions of the job, however; if an individual is unable to perform them, even with the accommodation, she cannot meet the definition of qualified." Id. (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256-57). "The burden is on the plaintiff to identify a reasonable accommodation the employer should have made." Id. (citing Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998)). "Nonetheless, an employer is not required to give an employee his choice of accommodation." Id. "And, although reasonable accommodations may include job restructuring, part-time hours, or reassignment to a vacant position, an employer is not required to create and fund a position as an accommodation, nor must an employer reallocate [*17]  job duties that would alter the essential function of a job." Id. Moreover, "an accommodation is unreasonable under [Eleventh Circuit] precedent unless it would allow the employee to 'perform the essential functions of their jobs presently or in the immediate future.' " Billups, 714 Fed. Appx. at 935 (quoting Wood v. Green, 323 F. 3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003)).
The question of whether Plaintiff was a "qualified individual" under the ADA thus turns on whether, in light of the medical restrictions given by her doctor, she was able to perform the "essential functions" of her job as a Food Service Assistant, with or without accommodation. The undersigned finds that Plaintiff has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on that issue. "Essential functions" are "the fundamental job duties of the employment position," but do "not include the marginal functions of the position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1). The determination of whether a function is "essential" under the ADA is made by "examining a number of factors" on a "case-by-case basis." Samson v. Fed. Express Corp., 746 F.3d 1196, 1201 (11th Cir. 2014). "A job function may be considered essential for any of several reasons, including but not limited to the following: (i) The function may be essential because the reason the position exists is to perform that function; (ii) The function may be essential [*18]  because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed; and/or (iii) The function may be highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i)-(iii). Additional factors a court should consider include, among others: the employer's judgment as to which functions are essential; written job descriptions; the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; and the consequences of not requiring the employee to perform the function. See Samson, 746 F.3d at 1201; 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)(i)-(iv). "Although the employer's judgment is 'entitled to substantial weight in the calculus,' this factor is not conclusive." Samson, 746 F.3d at 1201 (quoting Holly, 492 F.3d at 1258).
The undersigned finds that Plaintiff has not created an issue of fact on whether, as of June 11, 2018, she could have performed all the essential functions of her position, with or without accommodation. On June 11, 2018, Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Wheeler, wrote that it was her medical opinion that Plaintiff "need[ed] to have restrictions at work," that Plaintiff "could not lift more than 10 pounds due to chronic condition," and that "[t]hese restrictions were permanent." [*19]  (Doc. 65 at 357). Plaintiff's medical care provider repeated those restrictions in support of Plaintiff's July 2018 request for an ADA accommodation and also wrote that Plaintiff's impairment was "indefinite"; that Plaintiff was not "able to perform all essential job functions and physical requirements" because she could not lift more than 10 pounds; and as a recommended reasonable accommodation, the provider wrote, "please ask coworkers to perform lifting." (Doc. 66 at 106-07).
The undersigned finds that Plaintiff has not created a genuine issue of material fact on whether lifting more than 10 pounds was an essential function of her job. The job description for the FSA position listed the requirements for the position, including in relevant part:
Routine physical activities that are required to fulfill job responsibilities; ability to repetitively lift items weighing a maximum of 50 pounds, walk & stand on cement floors for up to 7.5 hours, climb ladder, stoop, bend, lift and have hands in water; ability to work extended periods in temperatures ranging from extremely hot to subzero; ability to tolerate work conditions while cooking, frying in hot oil, steaming, baking and microwaving; [*20]  operates equipment that poses possible risk, loss or injury; utilizes cleaning chemicals in solution, aerosol and powder forms; subject to a noisy environment; refer to page 3 for Physical Demand Categories.
(Doc. 65 at 228). The Physical Demands page rated lifting 10 pounds from floor to knuckle as continuous, i.e., 67 to 100 percent of the day; lifting 25 pounds from floor to knuckle as frequent, i.e., 34 to 66 percent of the day; and lifting 50 pounds from floor to knuckle as occasional, i.e., one to 33 percent of the day. (Doc. 65 at 230). The form also indicated that lifting 12.5 pounds from waist to overhead was performed frequently and 25 pounds from waist to overhead was performed occasionally; lifting 17.5 pounds from waist to chest was performed frequently and lifting 35 pounds from waist to chest was performed occasionally; two-hand carry of 25 pounds was performed frequently; and two-hand carry of 50 pounds was performed occasionally. (Id.). The form also indicated that pushing 33.5 pounds, e.g., utility carts, baker's racks, proofing/holding cabinets, etc., and pulling 33.5 pounds was performed occasionally. (Id.). FSAs were also required to rotate stock up to 50 pounds [*21]  to bring older food to the front and newer food to the back based on expiration dates on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis, one of the "Essential Duties" listed on the Job Description. (Def. SMF ¶ 7; Pl. SMF ¶ 11; Doc. 65 at 228). It is also undisputed that the District repeatedly advised Plaintiff that she could not perform the essential functions of her job with the 10-pound lifting restriction. Thus, the written job description and the employer's judgment about which functions were essential—which are entitled to substantial though not conclusive weight, Samson, 746 F.3d at 1201—militate in favor of finding that lifting more than 10 pounds was an essential function of Plaintiff's job. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)(i) & (ii).
Even Plaintiff's testimony about her job responsibilities indicates that lifting more than 10 pounds was an essential function of her job. Although she testified that she received assistance from co-workers when lifting items at or near 50 pounds once a week (Thomas Dep. 46-47, 54), she also testified her "duties also ranged from cleaning extensively, cooking, serving as a cashier, storing cooked food, lifting heavy kitchen equipment and putting away stock and cans" (Thomas Aff. ¶ 4) and that lifting was an "everyday [*22]  item" which she engaged in 30 percent of the time. (Thomas Dep. 53, 179). Plaintiff asserts in her brief, however, "that lifting was only a small part of her job duties" and that "Defendant has failed to produce any admissible evidence other than conjecture and innuendo that lifting over 50 pounds is an essential job function." (Doc. 64-1 at 17). But she fails to cite record support for her assertion that "lifting was only a small part of her job duties," and the issue is not whether lifting over 50 pounds is an essential job function. The issue is whether lifting over 10 pounds is an essential job function. For the reasons discussed above, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has failed to create an issue of fact on that critical point.
Plaintiff also contends that co-workers assisted her in lifting heavy items, i.e., those weighing at or near 50 pounds. (Doc. 64-1 at 17-18; Thomas Dep. 46-47, 54). Again, the issue is not whether lifting such heavy items was an essential function, but whether lifting more than 10 pounds—the limitation imposed by her doctor—was an essential function. The fact that other employees may have occasionally helped her lift heavier items does not create an [*23]  issue of fact on whether lifting more than 10 pounds was an essential function of her job.
Nor does the fact that employees may have helped Plaintiff lift heavier objects prior to June 11, 2018—when her doctor indicated that Plaintiff could not lift more than 10 pounds—demonstrate that that accommodation would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job thereafter. To the contrary, her physician's requested accommodation was to have Plaintiff's co-workers perform her lifting duties, i.e., "please ask coworkers to perform lifting." (Doc. 66 at 107). Plaintiff conclusorily asserts that having a co-worker lift items greater than ten pounds was a reasonable accommodation, but she offers no factual or legal support for that contention. (See Doc. 64-1 at 16-18). "The plaintiff bears the burden both to identify an accommodation and show that it is reasonable." Mason v. UPS Co., 674 Fed. Appx. 943, 951 (11th Cir. 2017). The undersigned has already found that Plaintiff has not created an issue of fact on whether lifting more than 10 pounds was an essential function of Plaintiff's job. The undersigned further finds that Plaintiff has not created a genuine issue of material fact on whether having her coworkers perform all lifting of [*24]  items weighing more than 10 pounds was a reasonable accommodation. Thus, she has not created an issue of fact on whether she could have performed the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation.3 See, e.g., Moon, 674 Fed. Appx. at 952-53 (finding that lifting requirements were essential functions and further finding that removing the duty to lift packages was not reasonable "as that would essentially transform the position into another one by eliminating essential functions of the job as it exists"); Dickey v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 351 Fed. Appx. 389, 392 (11th Cir. 2009) ("Dickey admitted that her medical condition prevented her from lifting more than 15 pounds or standing for long periods of time, which she knew were essential requirements of the position when she was hired. The only accommodation Dickey requested was that someone else perform all the significant lifting tasks otherwise assigned to her. Such an accommodation was not reasonable.").
The uncontroverted record shows that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her job that required her to lift more than 10 pounds, with or without reasonable accommodation, when Defendant terminated her employment in August 2018. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary [*25]  judgment be GRANTED on Plaintiff's ADA disability discrimination claim (Count I).

B. Section 504 Retaliation Claim (Count II)
In Count II, Plaintiff simply alleges, "[t]his count of Plaintiff's Complaint states a cause of action for retaliation in violation of § 504 [of the Rehabilitation Act]." (Doc. 1 ¶ 49). "The Rehabilitation Act incorporates the anti-retaliation provision from § 12203(a) of the ADA." Solloway v. Clayton, 738 Fed. Appx. 985, 988 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 791(f)). The ADA provides, "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). "The ADA's anti-retaliation provision is similar to Title VII's anti-retaliation provision, and the same analysis is used for both." Solloway, 738 Fed. Appx. at 988. "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, [Plaintiff] must show (1) she engaged in a statutorily protected expression; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the adverse action and her protected expression." Id. "Once the plaintiff establishes a prime facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action." Id. "If the employer meets its burden, '[t]he plaintiff must then demonstrate [*26]  that it will be able to establish at trial that the employer's proffered non-discriminatory reasons are a pretextual ruse to mask retaliation.' " Id. (quoting Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997)).
In setting forth her retaliation claim in her Complaint, Plaintiff did not describe what statutorily protected activity she engaged in or what adverse action was taken because of that statutorily protected activity. (See Doc. 1 ¶¶ 47-51). In its motion for summary judgment, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a retaliation claim because she cannot establish a causal connection between her request for an ADA accommodation and the denial of her subsequent job applications with the District and her termination because she has not shown that anyone who was responsible for reviewing those applications or making those hiring decisions knew of any of Plaintiff's statutorily protected activity, and because she does not know who made the termination decision. (Doc. 58-1 at 18-19). In response, Plaintiff simply quotes 20 C.F.R. § 1640.12 in support of her contention that "[t]he standards applicable to consideration of Defendant's violations of Title I of the ADA are the same as those applicable to consideration of Defendant's violation of Section 504 [*27] ," and she then asserts, "Accordingly, Plaintiff hereby incorporates the foregoing herein, and asserts the same arguments that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be denied." (Doc. 64-1 at 19-21). But Plaintiff's "foregoing" arguments centered on her ADA discrimination claim, not on her § 504 retaliation claim. She did not address Defendant's arguments concerning the deficiencies of that claim, nor did she identify her statutorily protected activity, the adverse action or actions that support that claim, or a causal connection between her protected activity and her adverse action, similar to the presentation of that claim in her Complaint.
Moreover, she has not created an issue of fact on whether Defendant's articulated reason for terminating her set forth in the District's August 10, 2018 letter (Doc. 66 at 103) was pretextual, i.e., she could not return to her job because she could not perform the essential functions of her job and therefore abandoned the job. See, e.g., Roddy v. City of Villa Rica, 536 Fed. Appx. 995, 1002 (11th Cir. 2013) (finding that the plaintiff failed to establish that the City's reason for terminating him, i.e., "his physical inability to return to work," was pretextual); McGhee v. PPG Indus., No. 4:18-CV-244 (CDL), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58832, at *26-27 (M.D. Ga. Apr. 3, 2020) (granting summary judgment on ADA retaliation [*28]  claim because the plaintiff did not offer any evidence that the defendant's reason for terminating him, i.e., "his permanent thirty-pound lifting restriction prevented him from performing an essential function of his job," was pretext for discrimination). It is therefore RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED on Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act retaliation claim (Count II).

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 58) be GRANTED.
The Clerk is directed to terminate the reference of this case to the undersigned Magistrate Judge.
It is SO REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED this 25th day of January, 2021.
