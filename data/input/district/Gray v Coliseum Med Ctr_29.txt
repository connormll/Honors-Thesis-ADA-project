Opinion



ORDER
Presently pending before the Court is Defendant Coliseum Medical Center's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 29). For the following reasons, Defendant Coliseum Medical Center's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 29) is GRANTED.

BACKGROUND
1. Procedural History
Plaintiff Gloria Gray filed the instant action alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and Retaliation under the ADA against Defendant Coliseum Medical Centers on February 17, 2009. (Doc. 1). Plaintiff's claims under the ADA relate to her condition of COPD/Sarcoidosis which require her to take breathing treatments several times a day, including the use of a Vest Airway Clearance System. Defendant answered Plaintiff's Complaint on May 7, 2009. (Doc. 4). On June 15, 2009, Plaintiff dismissed Count III of the Complaint by stipulation. (Doc. 9). Plaintiff moved to Amend her Complaint on January 7, 2010 and Defendant filed a timely response in opposition on February 1, 2010. [*2]  (Docs. 20, 21 and 25). Plaintiff's Motion was denied on March 3, 2010 by the Hon. Hugh Lawson, District Court Judge for the Middle District of Georgia. (Doc. 28). On March 31, 2010, Defendant filed its Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 29). Plaintiff filed a timely Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Defendant filed a timely Reply. (Docs. 30, 32, 33, 34, and 36). This case was transferred to this Court on June 24, 2010. Having reviewed Defendant's Motion (Doc. 29) the attachments thereto (Docs. 29-1 through 29-5) the subsequent briefs (Docs. 34, 35 and 36) and the authorities cited therein (see generally Docs. 30, 32, 33, 34, and 36) and having conducted its own relevant research, the Court finds that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 29) is now fully briefed and ripe for ruling.
2. Factual History
The following summary of relevant facts contains the undisputed facts derived from (i) the Complaint (Doc. 1), Defendant's Answer (Doc. 4), Defendant's Statement of Material Facts (Doc. 29-2), and Plaintiffs' Response thereto (Doc. 33), Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts (Doc. 32), and Defendant's Reply thereto (Doc. 36) which were submitted [*3]  pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 Where relevant, the factual summary also contains undisputed and disputed facts derived from the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits, all of which are construed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff as the nonmoving party. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.
Plaintiff Gloria Grey was hired by Defendant as a Food Service Supervisor in 1994. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 1). Plaintiff was responsible for food service preparation and the supervision of employees in the cafeteria and other food service areas. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 2). While the parties dispute the exact specifications of Plaintiff's areas of responsibilities, it is undisputed that Plaintiff was required to oversee catering and food services related to patient care. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 3-5, Doc. 33 at ¶ 2-5). Plaintiff was supervised by John Stiller from 1998 until her termination on January 24, 2008. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 75).
Initially Plaintiff's complaints regarding her work environment were prompted by the change of her shift schedule on or about September 8, 2007. [*5]  (Doc. 29-2 at ¶13). The schedule change was due, in part, to Stiller's need for a supervisor to be present during the heavy periods in the cafeteria. In response, Plaintiff requested an accommodation in accordance with the ADA. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶15). Plaintiff informed Stiller that she needed an accommodation from Defendant in order to take her twice-daily Vest Airway Clearance System treatment, which required her to disrobe. Id. Plaintiff made a verbal request for accommodation and also requested the accommodation by written letter to Human Resources. (Doc. 33 at ¶ 16-17). In the letter Plaintiff wrote to Human Resources she complained about the recent schedule change and stated that she had been "relegated" to the evening shift. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 20-21). The letter discusses Plaintiff's medical needs for the airway treatment but does not specifically request that Defendant provide her an alternative accommodation. (Doc. 29-2 at ex. 29-3). Plaintiff provided Stiller documentation that a medical therapist had given her specific instructions to take the Vest Airway Clearance System twice daily at 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Id. Mr. Stiller, Plaintiff's direct supervisor was never informed of [*6]  the letter to Human Resources by Plaintiff. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 23). Stiller alleges that Plaintiff complained about the new schedule change and cited her inability to pick up her niece from school, in addition to needing to take Vest Airway Clearance System treatment. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 25-26). Plaintiff denies that she ever made this statement. (Doc. 33 at ¶ 26).
After Plaintiff complained to Stiller regarding the schedule change and her need to take the Vest Airway Clearance System treatment at 5:00 p.m., a time within her newly scheduled shift, Stiller offered Plaintiff the use of his office as an alternative location to take her Vest Airway Clearance System treatment. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 27-28). Plaintiff never responded to Stiller's offer and never expressed any comments regarding an alternative accommodation. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 29-30). Plaintiff never took the treatments during her shift and began taking her treatments at the end of her shifts upon returning home. Id.
Prior to the above-mentioned schedule disagreement, Plaintiff had previously filed a grievance against Stiller on September 25, 2000. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 31). Plaintiff's 2000 grievance also related to a schedule change and did not [*7]  relate to her medical disability. Id. The 2000 grievance reflects that Plaintiff and Stiller had a minor verbal altercation. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 32). Plaintiff filed another grievance against Stiller in April of 2003, but before the 2007 schedule change referenced above, that also did not relate to her medical disability or Defendant's actions in response. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 33-34).
During her employment with Defendant Plaintiff was the subject of several disciplinary actions. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 35-50). In 1996, Plaintiff was disciplined and suspended for three days for an infraction with another co-worker. In 2000, Plaintiff was disciplined for "gross insubordination." (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 36-39). In 2007, Plaintiff was involved in an incident with another employee that Stiller considered demonstrative of poor communication skills. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 40-42). Throughout 2007, several incidents were brought to Stiller's attention regarding Plaintiff. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 44-47). The parties dispute the facts leading up to a meeting between Plaintiff and Stiller regarding the most serious incident, however, a Corrective Action Report was created by Stiller and Plaintiff refused to sign the report on December [*8]  27, 2007. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 48-51). The meeting and report were witnessed by an unrelated third-party. Id. Following this report, Plaintiff was suspended for three days on December 27, 2007. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 52-54).
Plaintiff requested a peer review of her suspension but did not allege any discrimination or retaliation on the part of Stiller. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 54). Plaintiff states that Stiller instructed her to discuss only the situation giving rise to the need for peer review and that she did not believe describing the discrimination would be useful in the peer review context. (Doc. 33 at ¶ 54-55). During the peer review hearing Plaintiff presented live testimony but did not reference the discrimination alleged in her Complaint. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 55-56). The Peer Review Panel upheld Plaintiff's Suspension. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 58).
Less than a month later, on or about January 10, 2008, Plaintiff was the subject of a complaint by an employee of Defendant. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 59-60). In response, Stiller prepared another Corrective Action Report stating that Defendant's disciplinary response to the incident in question would be to terminate Plaintiff's employment. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 60-62). Plaintiff again [*9]  refused to sign the document; the meeting was witnessed and the document signed by an unrelated third-party. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 62-64). Stiller then gave Plaintiff a second report arising from the January 10, 2008 incident which set forth a more detailed explanation for Plaintiff's termination. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 65-66). Plaintiff has not returned to work since her January 24, 2008 termination and has been deemed disabled by the Social Security Administration. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 74-75).

DISCUSSION
1. Jurisdiction
The Court's subject matter jurisdiction in this action is predicated on a federal question pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. See Doc. 1, at ¶ 1-4.
2. Summary Judgment Standard
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, summary judgment is proper "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). An issue is "genuine" if the quantum and quality of proof necessary to support liability under the claim is raised. Allen v. Tyson Foods, 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997). A fact is "material" if it hinges on the substantive law at issue and it might affect the outcome of the nonmoving party's claim. [*10]  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); see also Allen, 121 F.3d at 646. A judgment is appropriate "as a matter of law" when the nonmoving party has failed to meet its burden of persuading the Court on an essential element of the claim. See Cleveland v. Policy Management Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 804, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.
The movant bears the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. The movant can meet this burden by presenting evidence showing there is no dispute of material fact or by showing, or by pointing out to the district court that the nonmoving party has failed to present evidence in support of some element of its case on which it bears the ultimate burden of proof. See id. at 322-24. Once the movant has met his burden, the nonmoving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and identify "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Id. at 324. To avoid summary judgment, the nonmoving party must do more than summarily deny the allegations or 'show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).
On a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view all the evidence and all factual inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine whether that evidence could reasonably sustain a jury verdict. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23; Allen, 121 F.3d at 646. However, the [*11]  Court must grant summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).
3. Parties' Arguments
The case before the case appears complex but may be whittled to two simple questions. First, Plaintiff claims that she was discriminated against because of her disability by her former employer, Defendant. (Doc. 1). Defendant states that she was not discriminated against and that they made reasonable efforts to comply with her single request for an accommodation. (Docs. 29 and 29-1).
Second, Plaintiff claims that her termination was based on retaliation for her reporting of a maggot/mice infestation that reflected poorly upon her direct supervisor, Stiller. (Doc. 34). Defendant states that her termination was based on years of insubordination and a history of poor conduct. (Docs. 29-1 and 36).
4. Analysis
A. Count One: Americans With Disabilities Act
The Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") is a statutory scheme designed to remedy discrimination against persons with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213. As to a disabled person, Subchapter I regulates discrimination with regard to the terms and conditions of employment, §§ 12111-12117. See Albra v. Advan, Inc., 490 F.3d 826 (11th Cir. 2007). To establish [*12]  a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), a plaintiff must show that (1) she has a disability; (2) she is a qualified individual, that is, able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without an accommodation; and (3) she was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability. Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).2
The first element of the prima facie test that Plaintiff must satisfy is that she has a "disability" as that term is used in the ADA. Defendant does not, as far as the Court can ascertain, challenge the first element, which requires that Plaintiff prove she has a disability. See Docs. 29-1 and 36.3 The statute defines a "disability" as including "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). The Court finds that Plaintiff has met her burden of proof and shown that the breathing impairment limits many major life activities and creates a frequent shortness of breath. Further, Plaintiff has shown the Court that the limitation on her major life activity as a result of her disability is substantial. See Rossbach v. City of Miami, 371 F.3d 1354 (11th Cir. 2004). (outlining three-step process for establishing an ADA disability, [*13]  consisting of proof of (i) an impairment, (ii) limitation of a "major life activity," and (iii) substantial limitation of that major life activity by the impairment). Examples of "major life activities," defined in the ADA regulations include such things as: "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i) (emphasis added). Having reviewed the documentation regarding Plaintiff's COPD/Sarcoidosis presented to the Court, the Court finds that for purposes of the instant summary judgment analysis Plaintiff has shown that she is disabled as defined in the ADA
The second element a Plaintiff must prove to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination requires that Plaintiff prove she is a qualified individual. A qualified individual with a disability is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the functions of the employment position that such individual holds." 42 U.S.C. § 12111 (8) Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff meets the definition of a qualified individual under the ADA, and therefore the Court will assume for purposes of the instant analysis that Plaintiff is in fact a qualified [*14]  individual. When proving the second element, the Plaintiff must show that she is able to perform the essential functions of her job without accommodation, or failing that, show that she can perform the essential functions of her job with a reasonable accommodation. Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000). Here, Plaintiff states that at the time of the alleged discrimination she was fully able to carry out the functions of her job if Defendant had provided her a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 34).
The ADA imposes a duty upon employers to provide reasonable accommodations for known disabilities unless doing so would result in undue hardship to the employer. Albra v. Advan, Inc., 490 F.3d 826 (11th Cir. 2007). The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows her to perform the job's essential functions. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997). An accommodation is reasonable and required only if it enables the employee to perform an essential function of the job. McKane v. UBS Financial Services, Inc., 363 Fed. Appx. 679, 680 (11th Cir. 2010). An employee with a disability is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation. Id. ("[r]easonable accommodations may include: 'job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment [*15]  or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.') (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B)).
The key issue in this case surrounds the provision of the reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff contends that Defendant discriminated against her by failing to reasonably accommodate her disability following her request. In response, Defendants argue that Plaintiff never requested an accommodation, and even assuming arguendo that she made such request, Stiller offered Plaintiff the use of his office as a reasonable accommodation and she ignored his offer. (Docs. 29 and 36). According to the Plaintiff she both verbally and in writing requested a reasonable accommodation from Defendant to provide her with some solution that would allow her to take her required airway treatment. The facts in this case relating to Plaintiff's request for an accommodation and Defendant's response are wholly undisputed. (Docs. 29-2, 33). Stiller offered Plaintiff the use of his office as an alternative location to take her airway treatment. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 27-28). Plaintiff never [*16]  responded to Stiller's offer and never expressed any comments regarding the suitability, or lack thereof, of his offer as an alternative accommodation. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 29-30).
It is significant for purposes of this analysis that Stiller offered Plaintiff the use of his Office as an alternative location to take her airway treatment. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 27-28). For example, in McKane v. UBS Financial Services, Inc., 363 Fed. Appx. 679, 680 (11th Cir. 2010) the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment where plaintiff failed to show how his specific requested accommodation— moving his office to a remote location— was reasonable. The Circuit Court discussed that the presence of underlying conduct in support of plaintiff's termination, including the verbal abuse of his co-workers, weighed against a finding of wrongful termination due to discrimination. McKane v. UBS Financial Services, Inc., 363 Fed. Appx. 679, 680 (11th Cir. 2010). The Court further stated that "the evidence before the district court did not show that moving [plaintiff's] office to a remote location would have completely obviated the need for him to peacefully interact with coworkers, and as a result, his requested relocation did not constitute a reasonable accommodation." Id.
In McKane the plaintiff could not show that he was a qualified individual because of his failure [*17]  to prove that the Defendant did not provide him with a reasonable accommodation. Like the plaintiff in McKane, Plaintiff in the instant action has also failed to prove that she is a qualified individual under the ADA due to her failure to prove Defendant did not provide her with a reasonable accommodation. The record reflects that Plaintiff never even responded to Stiller's offer and never expressed any comments regarding an alternative accommodation. (Doc. 29-2 at ¶ 29-30). The Court does not find Plaintiff's behavior consistent with that of an employee that is in good faith working to find a reasonable accommodation at her place of employment. Plaintiff's explanation for her failure to respond focuses on her privacy concerns; Plaintiff did not want to take the treatments in Stiller's office because they required her to disrobe. See Doc. 29-3. Despite these concerns, Plaintiff never followed up with Stiller or other representatives of Defendant. See generally Docs. 29, 33, and 36. Moreover, Plaintiff never mentioned her alleged privacy concerns to Defendant or raised the issue of Defendant's failure to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's medical needs prior to her termination. Id. [*18]  The Court also notes that Plaintiff informed Defendant about her need for an accommodation in September of 2007 and an entire year and four months expired prior to any mention of the accommodation at the time of her termination in January of 2008. Id.
In their briefs, both parties direct the Court to the duties extending to employers and employees to engage in an interactive process concerning reasonable accommodation. (Docs. 29-1, 33, 36). Defendant's burden to follow-up with Plaintiff and investigate a reasonable accommodation cannot overcome Plaintiff's failure to show the Court that she properly requested the accommodation and was cooperative with Defendant when an accommodation was offered. The Court notes that "where a plaintiff cannot demonstrate [a] reasonable accommodation, the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." McKane, 363 Fed. Appx. 679, 681-682 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997). The related authority further notes that "an employer's failure to investigate does not relieve the plaintiff of the burden of proving the availability of a reasonable accommodation." Id. (quoting Moses v. American Nonwovens, Inc., 97 F.3d 446, 448 (11th Cir. 1996).
Plaintiff's sole contention of discrimination arises from the fact that Defendant, through Stiller, failed to accommodate [*19]  her request for a location in which to undergo her airway treatment. (Doc. 29). At the same time, Plaintiff has not shown the Court that she ever suggested an alternative reasonable accommodation. On the contrary, Defendant has shown the Court that it afforded a reasonable accommodation to Plaintiff which she chose to ignore. In fact, Plaintiff does not dispute that she failed to respond— even to express her acknowledgement— to Defendant's offered reasonable accommodation. Having reviewed the exhibits submitted in support of Defendant's motion, the Court finds that this dispute revolves more around Plaintiff's objection to the schedule change than alleged discrimination based on her disability. The Court can find no legal authority in this Circuit where a similarly situated Plaintiff was allowed recovery under the ADA after ignoring an employer's attempt to provide a reasonable accommodation. Therefore, Plaintiff cannot meet her burden regarding a prima facie showing of the second element requiring that Plaintiff is defined as a "qualified person" under the statute. Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts such that a reasonable jury could find that Defendant failed to provide Plaintiff [*20]  a reasonable accommodation as required under the ADA. The Court finds no merit in Plaintiff's argument and, for the reasons stated herein, summary judgment is appropriate as to Count One.
B. Analysis: Count Two: Retaliation
The Rehabilitation Act incorporates the anti-retaliation provision from § 12203(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 791(g), 793(d), 794(d); see Sutton v. Lader, 185 F.3d 1203, 1207 n. 5 (11th Cir. 1999) (stating that the standard for determining liability under the Rehabilitation Act is the same as under ADA, in the context of a discrimination claim). Under the ADA's anti-retaliation provision, "[n]o person shall discriminate against an individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). This anti-retaliation provision is similar to Title VII's prohibition on retaliation. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff may show that: (1) she engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) she suffered a materially adverse employment action; and (3) there was some causal relationship between the two events. Burgos-Stefanelli v. Secretary, U.S. Dept. of Homeland Sec., 410 Fed. Appx. 243, 2011 WL 165437 at *1 (11th Cir., 2011). The Court must then undertake the analysis based on the framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Id. (citing Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1305 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that the McDonnell Douglas analytic framework applies [*21]  to retaliation claims). Under this analysis, once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of retaliation, the employer then has an opportunity to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. Id. If the employer proffers such an explanation, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant's explanation is merely a pretext. Id.
It is difficult to define what protected activity Plaintiff engaged in based on the documents before the Court. However, it appears that Plaintiff's retaliation claim is based on two activities, (1) complaints made to officials regarding a rodent/maggot infestation in Defendant's cafeteria and kitchen facilities around September 2007, and (2) her complaints regarding Defendant's failure to accommodate Plaintiff's disability. (Doc. 29-1 at § 2, 34 at §§ X, XI, and XII). As Defendant points out, reporting an infestation does not qualify as a protected activity under the ADA. In order to sustain a claim for retaliation based on protected activity, Plaintiff must show that she had a "good faith, objectively reasonable belief that her activity was protected by the ADA." [*22]  Standard v. A.B.E.L. Services, Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998).
Regarding Plaintiff's claim that she was retaliated against by Defendant because she raised complaints to Defendant and Stiller regarding his failure to provide reasonable accommodation for her disability, the Court also finds the facts in this case insufficient to sustain a retaliation claim as pleaded. Plaintiff has provided the Court with no evidence that supports a finding that she ever informed Defendant of Stiller's failure to provide her a reasonable accommodation; nor has Plaintiff pleaded facts that demonstrate Defendant acted in a manner that was retaliatory following any disability related complaints by Plaintiff. Instead, Defendant has shown the Court that it had legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for Plaintiff's termination. (Doc. 29-2). Therefore, even if Plaintiff were to establish a prima facie case, which she has not, Defendant proffers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff's discharge. Plaintiff's termination was based on prior complaints and a well-documented disciplinary history. (Doc. 36).
There is simply no genuine issue of material fact to establish that Defendant did not proceed in good faith in its dealings with Plaintiff. Defendant discussed [*23]  performance issues with Plaintiff prior to her termination and she was formally reprimanded several times. After a disruptive incident on her watch, Defendant discharged Plaintiff. Thus, while Plaintiff can dispute that she engaged in wrongful conduct that was, in her opinion, sufficient basis for termination, even viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there simply is no genuine issue of material fact sufficient to preclude summary judgment as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim. Defendant sufficiently establishes that it had a reasonable and nondiscriminatory reason to terminate Plaintiff and provided foundation for its actions. Whether or not Defendant's reasons were "prudent or fair," there is no genuine issue of material fact as to Plaintiff's contention that Defendant's reasons violated federal law. See Standard v. A.B.E.L. Services, Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998). The Court reminds Plaintiff that its role in this action is not a super personnel office where Plaintiff may present her grievances regarding Defendant's employment decisions. The Court's role is to determine whether or not Defendant's employment decisions violated Plaintiff's constitutional rights, and in the instant case the decisions of Plaintiff's employer are within [*24]  its discretion under federal law and no violation of Plaintiff's rights occurred based on the record before the Court. For the reasons stated herein, the Court finds Summary Judgment to be appropriate as to Count Two.

CONCLUSION
Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion for Summary (Doc. 29) is GRANTED. Judgment shall be entered for Defendant as to Plaintiff's claim.
SO ORDERED, this 31st day of March, 2011.
