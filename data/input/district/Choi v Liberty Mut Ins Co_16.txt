Opinion



DECISION & ORDER
WILLAM F. KUNTZ, II, United States District Judge:
Seon Choi ("Plaintiff") brings this action against Liberty Mutual Insurance ("Liberty Mutual"), Jessica Rogin, Lulu Amendola and James Hinchley (the "Individual Defendants," collectively "Defendants") alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.; and the New York City Human Rights Law ("NYCHRL"), N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-101, et seq., including the anti-retaliation provisions of those statutes. Second Amended Complaint ("Second Am. Compl.") ECF No. 16 ¶ 1. Defendants move for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as to all claims asserted against them. Defendants also move, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) and 26(b)(5)(B), to strike as privileged one of Plaintiff's [*2]  submissions and to compel Plaintiff to return and certify destruction of all copies of the document. For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motion to strike is DENIED, and Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED in its entirety.

BACKGROUND
The following facts, drawn from the parties' Local Rule 56.1 Statements, are undisputed or described in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the non-moving party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Capobianco v. City of New York, 422 F.3d 47, 50 n.1 (2d Cir. 2005).1
Plaintiff was born in 1967. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' R. 56.1 St. ("Pl.'s Resp.") ¶ 9. Plaintiff started working for Liberty Mutual in January 2003. Id. ¶ 1. In 2015, Plaintiff held a full-time position as a Claims Manager handling director and officer ("D&O") claims in Liberty Mutual's Management Liability Claims department. Id. Plaintiff was a manager in her department and was responsible for a high volume of complicated claims. Id. ¶¶ 4-8.

Plaintiff's Age Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff alleges she was denied two separate promotions in 2015 due to her age. Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 43, 127, 141. First, Plaintiff alleges she was not promoted to "Director II, Special Projects — International" (the "Special Projects position"). Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 12. Instead, Defendant James Hinchley hired Jessica [*3]  So. Id. So is younger than Plaintiff but had more directly relevant experience. Id. ¶¶ 12-13, 15. Plaintiff never applied for the Special Projects position. Id. ¶ 13.
Second, Plaintiff alleges she was passed over for a promotion to "Vice President of the Errors & Omissions ("E&O") department." Id. ¶ 18. Instead, Defendants promoted Vivian Freedman, who is approximately five years younger than Plaintiff. Id. ¶ 19. Plaintiff's manager, John Patterson, had recommended Plaintiff for the role. Id. ¶ 18. Defendant Jessica Rogin testified she promoted Freedman because Rogin had positive experiences working with her previously and understood Freedman was a high performer. Rogin Decl. ¶¶ 3-5. Freedman received consistently higher performance review ratings than Plaintiff. Id.
In support of her age discrimination claims, Plaintiff points to a presentation Defendant Rogin prepared for Defendant Hinchley to introduce Hinchley to members of the claims team at Liberty Mutual. Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 22-23; Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 44-48. In preparing the presentation, Rogin asked several employees in the department, including Plaintiff, to report their level of experience. Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 24. Rogin then described [*4]  the overall experience levels of the claims department employees in the presentation. Id. ¶¶ 25-26. The presentation did not contain any employees' age. Id.

Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination Claims
On August 7, 2015, Plaintiff suffered a stroke, and was hospitalized for five weeks. Id. ¶¶ 33-34. Liberty Mutual, through its insurance carrier, provides eligible employees with short-term disability ("STD") and long-term disability ("LTD") benefits. Id. ¶ 36. Following her stroke, Plaintiff received six months of STD benefits, after which she elected to receive LTD benefits. Id. ¶¶ 36-37. Liberty Mutual granted Plaintiff an extended leave of absence during her recovery. Id. ¶ 39.
On February 4, 2016, approximately six months after her stroke, Plaintiff sent an accommodation request to her supervisor, Patterson, and Defendant Amendola, an HR manager at Liberty Mutual. Id. ¶¶ 43-44; Pl.'s St. of Additional Facts ("Pl.'s St.") ¶ 6. The request included a letter from Plaintiff's physician stating Plaintiff could return to work the following month, two days per week, in a "gradual fashion," id., and with a "lower level of responsibility," id. ¶ 45. After receiving the request, Patterson and [*5]  Amendola directed it to Gabriel Williams, an employee in Liberty Mutual's Employee Relations ("ER") department, for review. Id. ¶ 48. On February 22, 2016, approximately two weeks after Plaintiff made the accommodation request, Mary Hammond, an employee in Liberty Mutual's Human Resources ("HR") department responded to Plaintiff, apologized for the delayed response, and requested Plaintiff sign an authorization permitting Liberty Mutual to access Plaintiff's health records. Pl.'s St. ¶ 8. Defendants maintain the authorization was required to permit Defendants to assess Plaintiff's health and determine what reasonable accommodation could be made. Defendants' Local Rule 56.1 Statement ("Defs.' St.) ¶ 50. Plaintiff advised Defendants she did not feel comfortable signing a blanket authorization and directed Defendants to speak with her physicians, who could provide additional information. Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 52. On March 24, 2016, Plaintiff's physician provided Defendants with additional information and indicated Plaintiff was capable of performing duties on a reduced schedule with fewer responsibilities. Pl.'s St. ¶ 59. Plaintiff received no response from Defendants to the March 24, 2016 letter. Id. ¶ 61. [*6]  The record makes clear Defendants were working internally to review and respond to Plaintiff's request and were also awaiting Plaintiff's response to the request for a healthcare authorization. Id. ¶¶ 60, 62, 64.
The following month, Plaintiff, through her counsel, sent a letter informing Defendants she believed they had violated her rights pursuant to the ADA, ADEA, and NYCHRL. Id. ¶ 63. On June 30, 2016, the EEOC mailed a right to sue letter to the parties and on September 28, 2016, Plaintiff filed the instant action. Id. ¶ 65.
On January 10, 2017, Plaintiff's doctors provided additional information to Defendants regarding Plaintiff's medical condition. Id. ¶ 76. On February 24, 2017, Williams informed Plaintiff that her doctor indicated she did not suffer from an impairment to a major life activity qualifying as a disability, but explained Liberty Mutual would offer her a modified work schedule of four days per week, working from home one day per week. Pls. Resp. ¶ 66; Pl.'s St. ¶ 79. On April 14, 2017, having not heard back from Plaintiff, Williams reiterated this request. Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 68. On April 17, 2017, Plaintiff responded to Williams indicating she preferred to discuss the [*7]  terms of her return to work at a mediation session scheduled for the following month. Id. ¶ 69. On April 19, 2017, Williams told Plaintiff she needed to respond to Liberty Mutual's inquiries regarding her plans to return to work to avoid placing her return in jeopardy. Id. ¶ 72. On May 30, 2017, Plaintiff advised Liberty Mutual she sought to return to her prior position and requested a meeting to discuss her return. Id. ¶ 87. After discussing Plaintiff's options, Williams approved Plaintiff's request to return to work with a modified schedule. Id. ¶81. Plaintiff returned to work on July 31, 2017, as a full-time employee with a modified schedule and a higher salary. Id.

DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO STRIKE
In addition to their motion for summary judgment, Defendants also move to strike a document introduced by Plaintiff as an exhibit to her opposition brief. Defs.' Motion to Strike, ECF No. 73. On July 18, 2016, while the parties were engaged in mediation, Williams sent an email, which is the subject of the motion to strike, to Sarah Boyle, the case manager assigned to Plaintiff's case, copying Kim Starr, Defendants' in-house counsel. Defs.' Mem. of Law in Supp. of Motion to Strike, ECF. No. [*8]  74, at 3. Boyle was an employee of Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston ("Assurance"), which was a subsidiary of Liberty Mutual and was responsible for administering Plaintiff's STD and LTD benefits. Id. at 4. During discovery in this action, Defendants inadvertently disclosed the documents to Plaintiff. Id. At Williams's deposition, Plaintiff sought to introduce the document. Id. Defendants, relying on the claw-back provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, sought to block the admission of the document as privileged. Id. At the deposition, Plaintiff's counsel responded, "Okay. I don't have any questions specific to this email." Id. Despite this exchange, Plaintiff submitted the July 18, 2016 email exchange as an exhibit to her motion for summary judgment. ECF. No. 72-6. In response, Defendants filed the instant motion to strike the document as privileged.
A motion to strike asks the court to remove, "from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). A Rule 12(f) motion to strike is not proper in this instance, as an exhibit to a brief is not a "pleading" under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Monroe v. Bd. of Ed. of Town of Wolcott, Connecticut, 65 F.R.D. 641, 645 (D. Conn. 1975) (Blumenfeld, J.); Burns v. Bank of Am., 03-CV-1685, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40037, 2007 WL 1589437, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. June 4, 2007)  [*9]  (Berman, J.) ("reply brief and accompanying materials . . . is not a pleading, and thus [are] not properly the subject of a motion under Rule 12(f)"). Therefore, the Court hereby DENIES Defendants' motion to strike.
However, it is nonetheless necessary to determine what material the Court may consider in ruling on the instant motion for summary judgment, "and a motion to strike has sometimes been used to call to courts' attention questions about the admissibility of proffered material in similar circumstances." Monroe, 65 F.R.D. at 645.

A. Attorney-Client Privilege
After having carefully reviewed the email in question, the Court concludes the email is a privileged communication and privilege was not waived by the inadvertent disclosure. When asserting the attorney-client privilege, a party must show: "1) a communication between client and counsel, which 2) was intended to be and was in fact kept confidential, and 3) made for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice." Robert Strougo v. BEA Assocs., et al., 199 F.R.D. 515, 519 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (Sweet, J.) (quoting United States v. Construction Prods. Research, 73 F.3d 464, 473 (2d Cir. 1996)). The privilege's purpose is "to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients," thus promoting "broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice." Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S. Ct. 677, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1981). Under [*10]  the attorney-client privilege, it is the communication between the client and the attorney itself that is protected, not the underlying facts. In the corporate context, it is axiomatic that attorney-client privilege extends to a company's employees. See Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 389-91. The email at issue was sent between two non-lawyers, with in-house counsel for Defendants copied on the email chain. "[I]n the corporate context, the privilege may extend to communications among non-attorneys if they were made at the direction of counsel to gather information to aid counsel in providing legal services." Mestecky v. New York City Dep't of Educ., 13-CV-4302, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 196414, 2015 WL 13856993, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2015) (Amon, C.J.). Yet, "a document will not become privileged simply because an attorney recommended its preparation if it contains merely business-related or technical communications between corporate employees." Cicel (Beijing) Sci. & Tech. Co. v. Misonix, Inc., 331 F.R.D. 218, 234 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (Locke, Mag.). "[I]n analyzing communications created at the direction of . . . counsel, courts must be wary that the involvement of the attorney is not being used simply to shield corporate communications from disclosure." Id. "In order for the privilege to apply, (1) the communication should have been made for the purpose of securing legal advice; (2) [*11]  the employee making the communication should have done so at the direction of his corporate superior; (3) the superior made the request so that the corporation could secure legal advice; (4) the subject matter of the communication should have been within the scope of the employee's duties; and (5) the communication should not have been disseminated beyond those persons who need to know the information." Cuno, Inc. v. Pall Corp., 121 F.R.D. 198, 203 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) (Amon, Mag.).
Defendants have satisfied this standard. At the time the email was sent, the parties were actively engaged in mediation. The language of the email makes clear it was sent at the behest of attorney Starr specifically in order to obtain information to analyze the merits of Plaintiff's claim. While the label "privileged and confidential" is not dispositive, it further indicates that Williams, a non-lawyer, sent the email at the behest of attorney Starr in order to gain information relevant to Plaintiff's case. The subject matter of the email was within the scope of both Williams's and Boyle's duties and the communication was not disseminated beyond the three individuals on the email chain.
Additionally, Plaintiff asserts the email is not privileged because the communication [*12]  was between Defendant Liberty Mutual and a "third party." However, at the time Defendants produced this document Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston was Liberty Mutual's subsidiary.2 The Court therefore finds the communication occurred between agents of a corporate parent and subsidiary, not between Defendants and a "third party." Communications between employees of a subsidiary corporation may be privileged if the employee possesses information critical to the representation of the parent company and the communications concern matters within the scope of employment. Admiral Ins. Co. v. United States Dist. Court, 881 F.2d 1486, 1493 (9th Cir. 1989); see, e.g., Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers § 73 cmt. d (2000) ("For purpose of the privilege, when a parent corporation owns controlling interest in a corporate subsidiary, the parent corporation's agents who are responsible for legal matters of the subsidiary are considered agents of the subsidiary. The subsidiary corporation's agents who are responsible for affairs of the parent are also considered agents of the parent for the purpose of the privilege."); Bowne of N.Y.C., Inc. v. Am Base Corp., 150 F.R.D. 465, 491 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (Dolinger, Mag.) ("A number of courts have upheld the privilege for communications shared by the parent with its wholly-owned subsidiary, but they have done so only upon a showing that a common attorney [*13]  was representing both corporate entities or that the two corporations shared a common legal interest and thus came within the joint-client rule, or that the disclosure was made to an employee of the subsidiary for the principal or sole purpose of eliciting assistance to the attorney in rendering legal advice or other legal services.") (emphasis added). The Court is satisfied that Boyle and Williams, acting as representatives of Assurance and Liberty Mutual, respectively, shared a common legal interest in responding to and resolving Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation and that the request for information was made from Williams to Boyle with the principal purpose of eliciting assistance for attorney Starr in rendering legal advice regarding Plaintiff's claims.
Finally, Plaintiff asserts that even if the email was privileged, Defendants nonetheless waived the privilege by producing the document to Plaintiff during discovery. The Court is satisfied that Liberty Mutual complied with the claw-back provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and thus did not waive privilege. Federal Rule of Evidence 502(b) specifies that production of a privileged document does not constitute waiver of the privilege [*14]  if the disclosure was "inadvertent," the privilege holder "took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure," and the privilege holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error. Fed. R. Evid. 502(b).
Defendants discovered the inadvertent disclosure at Williams's deposition, when Plaintiff's counsel sought to introduce the document. Defendants immediately notified Plaintiff the document was privileged and inadvertently produced. Plaintiffs did not challenge defense counsel's contention and it was not until Plaintiff introduced the document as an exhibit to motion for summary judgment, that Defendants became aware Plaintiff objected to the designation of the document as privileged. Defense counsel's actions at the deposition were sufficient to comply with the claw-back provisions. Accordingly, the inadvertent disclosure did not constitute a waiver of privilege.
In sum, the content of the email makes clear it was sent at the behest of in-house counsel for the purpose of obtaining information relevant to assessing the merits of Plaintiff's legal claims while the parties were actively engaged in mediation and upon notice that the document was inadvertently produced, Defendants took prompt reasonable steps [*15]  to rectify the mistake.
Because the Court finds Defendants have met their burden of establishing the privileged status of the document, the email is not considered in deciding the motion for summary judgment. The Court orders Plaintiff to return and certify destruction of all copies of the privileged document.3

DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
The Court now turns to Defendants' motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff brings claims against Defendants alleging age discrimination in violation of the ADEA, disability discrimination in violation of the ADA, violations of the anti-retaliation provisions of both statutes, and analogous state law claims under the NYCHRL. Defendants move for summary judgment with respect to all claims. The Court takes each of the claims in turn.

I. Legal Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate where "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law" by citation to materials in the record, including depositions, affidavits, declarations, and electronically stored information. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)-(c). Affidavits and declarations, whether supporting or opposing a summary judgment motion, "must be [*16]  made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Id.; see also Patterson v. Cty. of Oneida, 375 F.3d 206, 219 (2d Cir. 2004). "In determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, [the] Court will construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant." Brod v. Omya, Inc., 653 F.3d 156, 164 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The role of the district court is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter, but rather to answer, "the threshold inquiry of determining whether there is the need for a trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The Court must therefore review whether the record could "lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party." Lovejoy-Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 212 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)).
If the moving party carries its preliminary burden, the burden shifts to the non-movant to raise the existence of "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Cityspec, Inc. v. Smith, 617 F. Supp. 2d 161, 168 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (Wexler, J.) (quoting Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" in support of the non-movant will be insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. Rather, the non-moving party must make a showing sufficient [*17]  to establish the existence of each element constituting its case. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) ("[A] complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial."). Conclusory statements, devoid of specifics, are insufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment. See Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 452 (2d Cir. 1999); Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir. 1998).

II. Age Discrimination Claims
The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). In evaluating discrimination claims brought under the ADEA, courts in the Second Circuit apply the burden shifting analysis set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 105-06 (2d Cir. 2010).
Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. McDonnell, 411 U.S. at 802. To establish a prima facie case under the ADEA, the Plaintiff must show (1) she was a member of the protected class; (2) she was qualified for the position at issue; (3) an adverse employment action was taken against her; and (4) the adverse action occurred [*18]  under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. See Terry v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 128, 137-38 (2d Cir. 2003). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the defendant may rebut the presumption of discrimination by coming forward with evidence supporting a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its actions. McDonnell, 411 U.S. at 802. If the defendant meets this burden, the plaintiff must then show by a preponderance of the evidence that the reasons proffered by the defendant were merely pretext for discrimination. Id. at 804. To satisfy this final burden in the McDonnell framework, the plaintiff "must offer evidence that age discrimination was the 'but-for' cause of the challenged actions" and not merely a contributing or motivating factor. Holowecki v. Fed. Express Corp., 382 Fed. Appx. 42, 45 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., 557 U.S. 167, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009)).
Plaintiff alleges two separate incidents of age discrimination. Both claims fail for the reasons set forth below.

A. The Special Projects Position
Plaintiff's first ADEA claim, arising from Defendant Hinchley's decision to hire So for the Special Projects position, fails. While the parties agree Plaintiff is a member of the protected class, Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of age discrimination because Plaintiff never applied to the Special Projects position, and therefore did not suffer any [*19]  adverse employment action. McGarty v. City of New York, 12-CV-2813, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130622, 2014 WL 4626019, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, 2014) (Buchwald, J.) ("[W]e conclude that [Plaintiff] has not established a prima facie case because she chose not to apply for the position."); Brown v. Coach Stores, 163 F.3d 706, 710 (2d Cir.1998) ("We read McDonnell Douglas. . . generally to require a plaintiff to allege that she or he applied for a specific position or positions and was rejected therefrom . . . ."); Alleva v. New York City Dep't of Investigation, 696 F. Supp. 2d 273 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (Block, J.), aff'd, 413 F. App'x 361 (2d Cir. 2011) (holding failure to promote 71-year-old employee of New York City Department of Investigation (DOI) was not age discrimination under ADEA where employee did not apply for position). Therefore, Plaintiff's age discrimination claim arising from her failure to be promoted to the Special Projects position is hereby DISMISSED.

B. Vice President of the E&O Department
Plaintiff also brings an age discrimination claim arising from Defendant Rogin's decision to hire Freedman for the Vice President of E&O role instead of Plaintiff. Here, Plaintiff again fails to establish a prima facie case. While Plaintiff is a member of the protected class and was qualified for the position, having been recommended by her direct supervisor, the singular fact that the person actually hired for the role was approximately [*20]  five younger than Plaintiff, is insufficient to give rise to an inference of discrimination. Baguer v. Spanish Broad. Sys., Inc., 04-CV-8393, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69212, 2010 WL 2813632, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. July 12, 2010) (Sullivan, J.) , aff'd, 423 F. App'x 102 (2d Cir. 2011) (finding eight-year age difference between Plaintiff and his replacement insufficient to support an inference of discrimination or establish pretext). Additionally, Rogin, who made the promotional decision, is older than Plaintiff, having been born in 1966. DeFina v. Meenan Oil Co., 924 F. Supp. 2d 423, 425 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (noting age discrimination unlikely where decision-makers were both over 40 and very close in age to plaintiff); Whitting v. Locust Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 10-CV-0742, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152233, 2012 WL 5289617, at *12 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 22, 2012) (Spatt, J.) (noting age discrimination unlikely where decision makers responsible for challenged action are over 40 years old); Mathews v. Atria Huntington, 499 F. Supp. 2d 258, 267 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (noting inference of age discrimination undermined where decision makers older than 40). Finally, Plaintiff's appeal to the slideshow prepared for Rogin as evidence of discriminatory intent is unavailing as the relevant slide did not mention any employees' age.
Even if the established facts gave rise to an inference of discrimination, shifting the burden to Defendants, Defendants have set forth legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for their decision not to promote Plaintiff. [*21]  Defendants allege Rogin hired Freedman instead of Plaintiff because Freedman had superior qualifications and consistently higher performance reviews. Further, Rogin testified she had worked previously with Freedman and had positive experiences. These proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for hiring Freedman would suffice to rebut the presumption of discrimination set forth in Plaintiff's prima facie case.
Because Plaintiff has failed to offer evidence these proffered reasons were merely pretextual, Plaintiff's second ADEA claim fails. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim is hereby DISMISSED.

III. Disability Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff also brings a claim under the ADA arising from Defendants' conduct after Plaintiff suffered a stroke in 2015. The ADA prohibits employers from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009). "Discrimination in violation of the ADA includes, inter alia, 'not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental [*22]  limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.'" McBride, 583 F.3d at 96 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)).
Disability discrimination claims under the ADA, like the claims under the ADEA, are subject to the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis. See McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125-26 (2d Cir. 2013). To make a prima facie case of disability discrimination premised on a failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: "(1) plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations." Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., Inc., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). A "reasonable accommodation may include, inter alia, modification of job duties and schedules, alteration of the facilities in which a job is performed, [and] acquisition of devices to assist the performance of job duties . . . ." McBride, 583 F.3d at 97.
Plaintiff has failed to set forth a prima facie case of disability discrimination. The first two elements of the prima facie case are not in dispute. At issue is whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation and [*23]  whether Defendants refused to make such accommodation. The Court need not determine whether Plaintiff would have been able to perform the essential function of her job after her stroke with a reasonable accommodation, as it is clear Defendants did ultimately provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation.
When Plaintiff returned to Liberty Mutual after her leave of absence, she occupied the same position she previously held, with a higher salary and at a reduced schedule to accommodate her further recovery. This constitutes a reasonable accommodation. Leon, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 230505, 2017 WL 6729676 at *5 ("An accommodation is reasonable if it 'enable[s] an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position . . . [or] to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employees without disabilities.'").
Plaintiff argues the delay in providing her such accommodation was itself a violation of the ADA. While a delay in providing a reasonable accommodation can violate the ADA, this is the case only "if that delay is caused by discriminatory animus and is sufficiently lengthy to constitute a constructive denial of a reasonable accommodation."  [*24] See e.g., Clark v. Jewish Childcare Ass'n, Inc., 96 F. Supp. 3d 237, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (Karas, J.) (noting Second Circuit courts have held delay in providing an accommodation can sustain an ADA claim if the plaintiff can show "the delay was motivated by the employer's discriminatory intent, as opposed to mere negligence"); Saunders v. Queensborough Cmty. Coll., 13-CV-5617, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128608, 2015 WL 56555719, at *7, n.8 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2015) (Castel, J.) (explaining that in ADA claims based on delay in providing a reasonable accommodation a plaintiff must show the delay was "motivated by discriminatory intent rather than 'mere bureaucratic incompetence' or negligence").
Plaintiff first requested an accommodation on February 4, 2016 and ultimately returned to work at Liberty Mutual on July 31, 2017. Both parties are partially responsible for the 18-month delay. Plaintiff's failure to provide the medical authorization slowed the process significantly. Similarly, Defendants spent a significant amount of time routing Plaintiff's request to the correct department and working internally to agree on a reasonable accommodation. Once Plaintiff instituted this action, an attempt at mediation further contributed to the delay. Despite the long period over which Plaintiff's request sat unanswered, Plaintiff has not shown the delay in granting [*25]  the accommodation request was due to any discriminatory intent. To the contrary, to the extent the delay is attributable to Defendants, the Court is satisfied it was due to bureaucratic inefficiency, and the normal delays that come with coordinating across the many departments of a large company. The undisputed facts make clear that during the 18-month period between Plaintiff's initial request for an accommodation and her return to work, both parties participated in the interactive process with intent to come to a suitable resolution.
Ultimately, Plaintiff was provided with a reasonable accommodation.,4 that it was not on the timeline she preferred is unavailing. Leon v. Dep't of Educ., 10-CV-2725, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 230505, 2017 WL 6729676, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2017) (Kuntz, J.), aff'd sub nom. Leon v. New York City Dep't of Educ., 740 F. App'x 759 (2d Cir. 2018) ("[E]mployers are not required to provide a perfect accommodation or the very accommodation most strongly preferred by the employee.") (internal citation omitted). Having failed to show Defendants denied her request for a reasonable accommodation, and consequently having failed to set forth a prima facie case of disability discrimination, Plaintiff's ADA claim is hereby DISMISSED.

IV. Retaliation Claims
In addition [*26]  to her substantive discrimination and failure to accommodate claims, Plaintiff asserts claims for retaliation under the ADA and ADEA. Retaliation claims under both statutes are also analyzed under the McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting framework. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADEA or the ADA, a plaintiff must show: "(1) participation in a protected activity; (2) the defendant's knowledge of the protected activity; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Kessler v. Westchester Cty. Dept. of Soc. Servs., 461 F.3d 199, 205-06 (2d Cir. 2006) (ADEA); Weissman v. Dawn Joy Fashions, Inc., 214 F.3d 224, 234 (2d Cir. 2000) (reciting substantially identical elements under the ADA).
Plaintiff has failed to set forth a prima facie case of retaliation, because she did not suffer an adverse employment action. While Plaintiff's request for an accommodation and her filing of this lawsuit were protected activities, Liberty Mutual never terminated Plaintiff's employment, demoted Plaintiff, or reduced either her salary or benefits. To the extent Plaintiff argues she suffered a retaliatory action when Williams told her to respond to Defendants' inquiries regarding her return-to-work plans, or else she risked jeopardizing her return, this argument [*27]  fails. While threats of termination can be adverse employment actions when they "dissuade[] a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination," Rivera v. Rochester Genesee Reg'l Transp. Auth., 743 F.3d 11, 26 (2d Cir. 2014), the Court does not interpret William's statement as a threat. Even if it did, Williams was not threatening to terminate Plaintiff for engaging in protected activity, i.e. for filing the instant lawsuit or requesting an accommodation, but rather for failing to engage meaningfully in the interactive process to come to a resolution. This is not the type of activity the ADEA's anti-retaliation clause is designed to protect. Having failed to show an adverse employment action, Plaintiff's retaliation claims fail and are therefore DISMISSED.

V. NYCHRL Claims
Having disposed of Plaintiff's claims under the ADA and ADEA, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims under the NYCHRL. See In re Merrill Lynch Ltd. P'ships Litig., 154 F.3d 56, 61 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (noting "when the federal claims are dismissed the 'state claims should be dismissed as well'") (quoting United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966)); see also Marquez v. City of N.Y., 14-cv-8185, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123897, 2016 WL 4767577, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2016) (Nathan, J.) (declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over NYCHRL after granting summary judgment on Title VII claims). Therefore, Plaintiff's [*28]  disability, age discrimination, retaliation and aiding and abetting claims arising under the NYCHRL are DISMISSED.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Defendants' motion to strike is DENIED and Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED with respect to Plaintiff's federal claims. Furthermore, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the NYCHRL claims.
The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motions at ECF No. 65 and ECF No. 73 and to close this case.
SO ORDERED.
