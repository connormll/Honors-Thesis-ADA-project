Opinion



MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Marvin Craven filed the above-styled employment discrimination action on July 27, 2020. [Doc. 1]. Plaintiff Craven's claims against Defendant Alpha Omega Construction Group, Inc. are for disability discrimination brought pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. [Doc. 1, Counts I, II]. Plaintiff alleges in Count One that Defendant terminated his employment because of his disability and/or because the company regarded him as disabled. [Id., Count I]. In Count Two, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the ADA by failing to provide him with a reasonable accommodation. [Id., Count II]. This action is presently before the Court on a motion for summary judgment [Doc. 69] [*2]  filed by Plaintiff and a motion for summary judgment [Doc. 70] filed by Defendant. The summary judgment motions are filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.

I. FACTS
Defendant Alpha Omega Construction Group ("AOCG") is a roofing and siding company that has offices in eleven U.S. locations, including an Atlanta area branch located in Alpharetta, Georgia ("Atlanta branch"). [Doc. 70-2, Defendant's Statement of Material Facts ("DSMF") ¶ 1]. There are no other AOCG offices within 75 miles of the Atlanta branch; the nearest is in Greenville, South Carolina, approximately 130 miles away. [DSMF ¶ 10]. AOCG is an equal opportunity employer and maintains policies prohibiting discrimination against all employees based on protected characteristics. [DSMF ¶ 2].
On April 11, 2016, Defendant AOCG hired Plaintiff Marvin Craven as a Field Supervisor in the siding division in the office in Raleigh, North Carolina. [Doc. 69-1, Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts ("PSMF") ¶ 2; DSMF ¶ 3]. Plaintiff transferred to AOCG's Atlanta branch in December 2018 where he worked as a Field Supervisor in the residential roofing division. [DSMF ¶ 3; PSMF ¶ 3]. Plaintiff was not trained in any other positions at AOCG. [DSMF ¶ 6]. For much [*3]  of the relevant time, Plaintiff was one of only two Field Supervisors in the Atlanta branch. [DSMF ¶ 11].
At all times during his employment, Plaintiff was an at-will employee. [DSMF ¶ 4]. When Plaintiff was hired, he signed a "Receipt of Employee Guide" acknowledging "receipt and understanding of the Alpha Omega Construction Group, Inc. employee handbook" that included AOCG's Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and Medical Leave of Absence (non-FMLA Leave) Policy with which Plaintiff was familiar. [DSMF ¶ 5].
AOCG's Atlanta branch covers the entire Atlanta metropolitan area, including from Dawsonville east to Athens, south through Smyrna to McDonough, and west to Newnan, encompassing approximately 43 communities. [DSMF ¶ 7]. When Plaintiff was employed as a Field Supervisor in the Atlanta branch, his territory covered the north side of Atlanta including from just south of Alpharetta, north to Dawsonville. [DSMF ¶ 8]. However, Plaintiff testified that shortly after he arrived at the Atlanta branch in December 2018, he covered the entire state of Georgia by himself for about four months. [Doc. 62, Plaintiff's Deposition ("Pla. Dep.") at 44-45, 50-52]. Plaintiff testified that in February [*4]  or March 2019, AOCG gave him a $1,500 bonus. [PSMF ¶ 4; Pla. Dep. at 42]. In April of 2019, AOCG gave Plaintiff a 25% raise from $45,000 to $57,000. [PSMF ¶ 5].
In February 2020, Plaintiff's supervisor, Atlanta Branch Manager Javier Ruiz, rated Plaintiff as "satisfactory" from the options of "poor," "fair," "satisfactory," "good," and "excellent." [PSMF ¶ 6; Doc. 60-6 at 2; Doc. 65, Ruiz Dep. at 28-29]. When Mr. Ruiz was asked about his rating of Plaintiff's work record, he testified, "Satisfactory employee in my mind is an average employee." [Ruiz Dep. at 29].
Plaintiff experienced problems with his left knee from 2008 to 2016, and he began receiving injections in 2016. [PSMF ¶ 1]. Plaintiff's medical records indicate that he saw his doctor on November 12, 2019, for a knee injury. [DSMF ¶ 12]. In November of 2019, Dr. Dale Lane, an expert in the field of orthopedics and the treatment of knees, diagnosed Plaintiff with tricompartmental disease and ordered knee replacement surgery. [PSMF ¶ 7]. Plaintiff testified that the same month, he informed AOCG that he needed knee surgery at an in-person meeting with Director of Operations Stuart Greifinger, Chief Operating Officer Chris Stafford, [*5]  and Mr. Ruiz. [PSMF ¶ 8; Pla. Dep. at 74-75]. Plaintiff testified, "We had a meeting the morning that I had my last MRI, and I told them I'm going to have it this — and it's just — we're going to have to get it scheduled when they can have the pieces made. And they said, okay, just keep us informed of what's going on and the date that you're going to have it done." [Pla. Dep. at 74].
Plaintiff notified Branch Manager Ruiz in January 2020 that his knee surgery was scheduled for February 24, 2020, and he would be out three to four weeks. [DSMF ¶ 13; Doc. 60-4]. On January 15, 2020, Human Resources ("HR") employee Shavon Bell emailed Plaintiff recommending he begin filing a short-term disability claim. [DSMF ¶ 14]. AOCG arranged for Plaintiff to pre-pay his health insurance premiums prior to his leave to cover the premiums incurred during his leave. [DSMF ¶ 15]. While AOCG is subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), in offices with fewer than 50 employees in a 75-mile radius, such as the Atlanta branch, employees may request medical leave under AOCG's Medical Leave of Absence (Non-FMLA Leave) Policy. [DSMF ¶ 16]. Non-FMLA Leave requests for more than 21 days are considered [*6]  on a case-by-case basis and require the employee to submit a request form along with a doctor's note to HR. [DSMF ¶ 17].
On January 30, 2020, Ms. Bell sent Plaintiff a medical leave request form and he subsequently began working on paperwork relating to his leave. [PSMF ¶ 9; Doc. 77, Defendant's Response to PSMF ¶ 9; Doc. 60-5 at 1; DSMF ¶ 18]. Plaintiff first submitted a completed form dated February 3, 2020; Ms. Bell then forwarded the form to HR Director Crystal Brookshire for evaluation. [DSMF ¶ 19]. Portions of the form were missing information or were illegible, so Ms. Bell sent the form back to Plaintiff to be completed. [DSMF ¶ 20].
On February 6, 2020, Plaintiff Craven filled out a written form requesting eight weeks of leave (from February 24, 2020 to April 20, 2020) to rehab from his knee surgery. [PSMF ¶ 10; Doc. 63-3 at 3]. Attached to Plaintiff's leave request form was a statement completed by his physician, Dr. Dale Lane, which stated that Plaintiff's expected return-to-work date was April 20, 2020. [Doc. 63-3 at 6; DSMF ¶ 37]. Dr. Lane also wrote that Plaintiff had the following limitations and restrictions: "no driving, no squatting kneeling, unable to walk long distance, [*7]  unable to stand long . . . ambulatory aids, limit stair use." [Doc. 63-3 at 6]. Dr. Lane's practice is to obtain information about a patient's job duties from the patient. [DSMF ¶ 36].
Defendant AOCG's process for evaluating a non-FMLA leave request includes reviewing the employee's job duties against the doctor's note. [DSMF ¶ 22]. AOCG personnel also speak with Chief Operating Officer Chris Stafford, Vice President Mike Al-Hassan, relevant business partners, and the employee's manager to determine the market's needs and available support in the market to cover the leave requested. [Id.]. AOCG's evaluation of Plaintiff's leave request included input from Atlanta Branch Manager Javier Ruiz, Director of Operations Stuart Greifinger, and Mr. Stafford to determine the company's business needs in relation to Plaintiff's request. [DSMF ¶ 38]. Mr. Ruiz wrote that Plaintiff's absence "will make it harder for us to get all the work done on time. [Field Supervisor] David Mendoza has a big area to cover. Besides new installs, punch service and warranty calls it will be impossible for him to cover both areas. I am planning to be . . . out in the field to back him up which will affect my administrative [*8]  work in the office." [Doc. 60-6 at 2; DSMF ¶ 39]. After completing the evaluation, Mr. Stafford, upon consulting with HR Director Crystal Brookshire and Mr. Al-Hassan, determined that AOCG could not accommodate Plaintiff's leave request. [DSMF ¶ 41].
On Friday, February 14, 2020, Ms. Bell and Mr. Ruiz informed Plaintiff that his leave request was denied. [DSMF ¶ 42]. After the conversation, Plaintiff left the office. [DSMF ¶ 43]. He also left his company phone and laptop behind, something he did not routinely do on a Friday afternoon. [Id.]. As a result, AOCG was unclear as to whether Plaintiff had quit his job. [Id.]. On the same afternoon (Friday, February 14, 2020), Ms. Bell sent an email to Plaintiff stating that she assumed he was resigning that day given the fact that he had turned in his company property. [DSMF ¶ 44]. Ms. Bell also stated in the email that Plaintiff could work until February 21, 2020, the last workday before his scheduled leave. [DSMF ¶ 44].
Ms. Bell wrote a letter to Plaintiff on February 14, 2020 stating, inter alia, the following: "As discussed on February 14, 2020 you are not eligible for FMLA leave due to the small number of employees in the Atlanta Office. [*9]  . . . Due to this we will not be able to approve your absence for the length of leave requested. It presents an undue hardship on the business to be functional without your position for the 3 months requested." [PSMF ¶ 11; Doc. 60-7 at 1]. HR Director Crystal Brookshire testified that the reference to three months was a mistake and that she knew Plaintiff was requesting two months of leave. [Doc. 61, Brookshire Dep. at 69-70]. Ms. Bell likewise testified that the reference to three months in the letter might have been a mistake. [Doc. 60, Bell Dep. at 109-10]. Plaintiff testified that he called Ms. Bell on the weekend of February 15, 2020 and informed her that he "would go ahead and finish out the last week before [AOCG] terminated [him]." [Pla. Dep. at 117].
Plaintiff Craven returned to work on Monday, February 17, 2020. [DSMF ¶ 46]. That same day, Plaintiff sent an email to Ms. Bell stating the following, in part:
When I requested time off in my mind I thought I could be back in 4 weeks. I can't even drive for 4 weeks and I have staples for 3 weeks and Physical Therapy in my home for 4 weeks 3 days a week. Then I have Physical Therapy 3 times a week at the clinic up until May 2020. [*10]  It's a possibility I could have returned with restrictions on 3-30-20 after I was released to drive. If anyone would have come to me weeks ago I could have ask my doctor. He was the one that put the 4-24-20 date I didn't request that. If I returned 3-30-20 I would have restrictions 3 physical therapy appointments per week for 1 hour per day, no ladder climbing and no lifting over 5 pounds. I could work in office, scheduled work and materials, work from home as I do no after hours and drove to check jobs and crews. . . . If you would consider me continuing to work at Alpha Omega and returning on 3-30-20 with the listed restrictions please let me know ASAP. I can then get with my doctor and ask him if he'd consider that and have note sent over saying I can return with restrictions. Please discuss with upper management and make your determination. If I don't hear back from you I will consider my termination as of 2-21-20 effective.
[Doc. 60-10 (errors in original)]. Ms. Bell responded to Plaintiff by stating, in part:
You are more than welcome to return to the doctor for a second opinion regarding your leave and restrictions. However, this revised request for Medical Leave would have to [*11]  go through the same approval process as your original leave so I would hate to promise that it would be automatically approved. We would really need to determine if we would be able to accommodate your restrictions and ensure you would be safe. As of now, until we receive that revised request for Medical Leave we will consider 2.21.2020 your last day as your initial request for Medical Leave beginning on 2.24.2020 has been denied.
[Doc. 62-1 at 42]. Ms. Brookshire was asked and testified to the following:
Q. [W]as the information provided by Mr. Craven as part of the interactive process, the accommodation offer, quote, If I returned 3/30/20, I would have restrictions of three physical therapy appointments per week for one hour per day, no ladder climbing and no lifting over 5 pounds, did that present an undue hardship to the company?
A. That wasn't the full story so we didn't evaluate that part.
[Brookshire Dep. at 76-77].
Plaintiff submitted a second Medical Leave Request Form and doctor's note via email on Thursday, February 20, 2020 at 4:23 p.m. [DSMF ¶ 50; PSMF ¶ 21; Doc. 60-13 at 2-7; Doc. 62-1 at 44-47]. This was the day before Plaintiff's last scheduled workday. [Id.]. In the revised [*12]  leave request, Plaintiff stated that he anticipated returning to his normal work schedule and duties on March 30, 2020. [PSMF ¶ 28; Doc. 60-13 at 6; Doc. 62-1 at 46]. Attached to the leave request was a note from Plaintiff's treating physician, Dr. Dale Lane, stating that Plaintiff could return to work on March 30, 2020 with the following work limitations: "No climbing, no lifting more than 5 lbs., allow patient to work from home and MUST attend scheduled PT sessions." [Doc. 60-13 at 7; Doc. 62-1 at 47 (emphasis in original); PSMF ¶ 22]. The return-to-work note from Dr. Lane, which was dated February 19, 2020, did not state the restrictions' duration and AOCG did not seek clarification on how long any work-from-home limitations were necessary. [Doc. 62-1 at 47; PSMF ¶¶ 25, 26]. Plaintiff's medical records show that he requested a new note from Dr. Lane so that he could get the company "off [his] back about being gone 2 months," and that if he had to be gone longer, he would deal with it later. [DSMF ¶ 49; Doc. 64-2 at 1]. Plaintiff's medical records also reveal that he informed his health care providers that his work duties "entail climbing" and that he "has to be able to climb ladders [*13]  at work." [Doc. 64-4 at 3; Doc. 64-8 at 1, 3].1
On February 21, 2020 at 9:23 a.m., Ms. Bell emailed Plaintiff's revised request and doctor's note to Director of Operations Stuart Greifinger, Chief Operating Officer Chris Stafford, and Atlanta Branch Manager Javier Ruiz. [DSMF ¶ 52]. Mr. Greifinger replied that he did not see how Plaintiff could be allowed to work from home, as his position required him to be in the field 80% of the time. [DSMF ¶ 53; Doc. 60-13 at 1]. Ms. Bell and Ms. Brookshire reviewed the revised request, including how long Plaintiff would be out of work and the indefinite amount of time he would work from home. [DSMF ¶ 54]. Mr. Stafford made the final decision not to accommodate the revised request. [DSMF ¶ 55]. [*14] 
On February 21, 2020, Ms. Bell sent Plaintiff an email stating that AOCG's "initial decision still stands with regard to your leave denial." [Doc. 60-14]. Ms. Bell also wrote in the email that AOCG would be "unable to accommodate the limitations set forth by [Plaintiff's] doctor including no climbing, no lifting more than 5 lbs. and working from home. Many of the essential duties of a Field Supervisor involve being in the field and climbing so working from home would not be something [AOCG] can accommodate at this point in time." [PSMF ¶ 31; DSMF ¶ 56; Doc. 60-14]. AOCG terminated Plaintiff's employment on February 21, 2020, and Plaintiff did not contact AOCG again after receiving the email sent on this date. [DSMF ¶¶ 3, 9, 56, 57].
Defendant AOCG's written job description of the Field Supervisor position lists a number of essential duties and responsibilities, including: inspecting work areas; directing workers in projects; maintaining project/job scheduling; coordinating roofing materials drop offs and pick-ups; sourcing and recruiting labor; verifying orders; performing pre- and post-inspections; interpreting and enforcing safety regulations; analyzing and resolving work problems, [*15]  or assisting workers in solving work problems; and traveling to other markets as needed. [Doc. 63-1]. The written job description does not list "ladder climbing," "lifting over 5 pounds," or getting on a roof as a job duty. [PSMF ¶ 19]. David Mendoza, a fellow Atlanta Field Supervisor who worked for AOCG from some point in 2019 until March 2020, testified that the job could be performed without climbing ladders, getting on a roof, or getting in the attic. [PSMF ¶ 20; Doc. 69-2, Mendoza Declaration ("Dec.") ¶¶ 4-7]. Plaintiff testified that in the fifteen months he worked as a Field Supervisor in the Atlanta branch, he climbed a ladder twice. [Pla. Dep. at 63-65].
The Field Supervisor oversees jobs being performed by subcontractors and involves extensive driving to job sites. [DSMF ¶¶ 23, 24]. Plaintiff stated that he drove six hours per day. [DSMF ¶ 24]. Field Supervisor job duties include administrative tasks, such as responding to emails and verifying invoices. [DSMF ¶ 33]. Job duties also include personally performing pre-, post-, and safety inspections at the job sites. [DSMF ¶ 27]. Pre-inspections are performed at the job site prior to the roof installation to ensure that the house [*16]  is ready for the project and the lot accessible. [DSMF ¶ 28]. Safety inspections are performed at the job site during the project to ensure OSHA compliance including to ensure that the crews are wearing hard hats and properly tied-off harnesses. [DSMF ¶ 29]. Post-inspections are performed at the job site after the installation to ensure that the job site is clean and there are no raised or damaged shingles. [DSMF ¶ 30].
AOCG Director of Operations Stuart Greifinger was asked and testified to the following:
Q. With the no lifting over 5 pounds, what essential portions of a field supervisor job require lifting of more than 5 pounds?
A. Picking up bundles, taking returns. They are approximately 60 pounds a bundle. A box of nails is probably 20 pounds; button caps, probably 10 to 12; starter, 45 pounds. Pretty much all the products except wall flashing exceed 5 pounds that we typically grab from the warehouse to take to the site. And when it is left over, we put it back in the truck so we can take it back and return the material.
[Doc. 63, Greifinger Dep. at 72]. Plaintiff was asked and testified to the following:
Q. You didn't ever lift more than 5 pounds as part of your job duties as a field [*17]  supervisor at Alpha Omega?
A. Not on a consistent basis I did not.
Q. Well, what would an inconsistent basis be? Once a week? Twice a week?
A. Maybe once a month or something, just if somebody forgot something at the office.
Q. Something like what? What would be an example?
A. A roll of felt paper, something like that. I was not carrying stuff around, moving stuff around. That's not what I did.
[Pla. Dep. at 136-37]. Mr. Greifinger was asked and testified to the following:
Q. Do field supervisors as part of either their inspection process or leak repair duties, do they have to get into the attics of these homes?
A. Sometimes, yes. Not every time.
Q. What other sorts of climbing -- again, not talking about ladders -- could we potentially be talking about? What else does the word "climbing" mean to you in the context of the jobs that Alpha Omega went on?
A. In that, it would be a ladder or a staircase or fold-down stairs for attics.
[Greifinger Dep. at 103].
Plaintiff completed an intake form and filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") on February 19, 2020, in which he indicated that he had asked AOCG for leave and had offered to work from home. [*18]  [DSMF ¶ 58; Doc. 62-1 at 69-74]. Plaintiff stated on his EEOC Intake Questionnaire that he had no disability but was treated by AOCG as disabled. [DSMF ¶ 59]. Plaintiff reiterated in his Complaint filed on July 27, 2020 that he had offered to work from home and that his requested accommodations were for leave and to work from home in the "services" side of the business. [DSMF ¶ 60].
There was no other position available in the Atlanta branch to which Plaintiff could be temporarily transferred and for which he was qualified, including working as a Scheduler, as the office had one already. [DSMF ¶ 61]. At the time of Plaintiff's termination, there were approximately seven or eight employees in the Atlanta branch, of which all but the two Field Supervisors were related to office and/or sales positions. [DSMF ¶ 9]. Since his termination, Plaintiff has argued that he could have performed his duties sooner than what was indicated in the doctor's notes. [DSMF ¶ 62]. Plaintiff was on short-term disability from March to May 2020 and on long-term disability from June to September 2020. [DSMF ¶ 63]. Plaintiff's medical records indicate that as of July 28, 2020, he could not climb ladders or traverse [*19]  unprotected heights for another six months. [DSMF ¶ 64].
Additional facts will be set forth as necessary during discussion of Plaintiff's claims.

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears the initial responsibility of asserting the basis for its motion. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986); Apcoa, Inc. v. Fidelity Nat'l Bank, 906 F.2d 610, 611 (11th Cir. 1990). The movant is not required, however, to negate its opponent's claim; the movant may discharge its burden by merely "'showing' — that is, pointing out to the district court — that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. After the movant has carried its burden, the non-moving party is then required to "go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence designating specific facts showing that there is a genuine disputed issue for trial; the non-moving party may meet its burden through affidavit and deposition testimony, answers to interrogatories, and the like. Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).
While the court is to view all evidence and factual inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n v. Norton, 324 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir. 2003), "the mere existence of some alleged [*20]  factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact," Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986) (emphasis in original). A fact is material when it is identified as such by the controlling substantive law. Id. at 248. Moreover, the non-movant "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986) (citations omitted). Instead, "the nonmoving party must present evidence beyond the pleadings showing that a reasonable jury could find in its favor." Fickling v. United States, 507 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990)). An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50. Thus, the Federal Rules mandate the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of every element essential to that party's case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.
"When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes [*21]  of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). In the present case, both parties have moved for summary judgment. The Court, therefore, views all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff in evaluating Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 70] and in the light most favorable to Defendant in evaluating Plaintiff's summary judgment motion [Doc. 69].

III. DISCUSSION

A. Disability Termination Claim
The ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (quoting Harding v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F. Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). "The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against 'a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.'" Batson v. Salvation Army, 897 F.3d 1320, 1326 (11th Cir. 2018) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)); accord Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001). "An employer who fires a qualified employee with a disability violates the ADA if the employer would not have fired the employee but for [his] disability." Jones v. Aaron's Inc., 748 F. App'x 907, 914 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1077 (11th Cir. 1996) ("The ADA imposes a 'but-for' [*22]  liability standard.")). Plaintiff Marvin Craven alleges that Defendant AOCG terminated his employment because of his disability and/or because the company regarded him as disabled. [Doc. 1, Count I].
Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim is evaluated using the burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).2 See Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2007) ("Under the controlling law in this Circuit, '[t]he burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims is applicable to ADA claims.'") (quoting Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000)). Under this framework, the allocation of burdens and order of presentation and proof are as follows: (1) the plaintiff has the burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the action taken against the employee; and (3) should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must have an opportunity to prove that the legitimate reason offered by the defendant was a pretext for discrimination. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-05.
To establish a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he has a disability [*23]  as defined in the ADA; (2) he is a "qualified individual"; and (3) "he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability." Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1267-68 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256). "For the first element of an ADA claim, a plaintiff qualifies as disabled under the ADA if he has '(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities . . . ; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) [is] regarded as having such an impairment." Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)). Plaintiff asserts in his Complaint that he "had or was regarded as having a condition that limits major life activities." [Doc. 1, Count I].
Under the ADA, "major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") amended the ADA to further provide that, for the purpose of establishing the existence of a "disability," major life activities include "the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, [*24]  brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B). The ADAAA states that "[t]he definition of disability in this Act shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under this Act, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this Act." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A).
In the present case, the Court finds that Plaintiff Craven has offered evidence sufficient to show that he has a physical impairment that substantially limited major life activities, including walking. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's impairment was temporary in nature and, therefore, was not a disability. [Doc. 70-1 at 13]. Defendant contends that from the time when Plaintiff saw his doctor on November 12, 2019, until the time he could have returned to full duty on March 30, 2020, was less than five months. [Id.]. This argument is unpersuasive.
Plaintiff experienced problems with his left knee from 2008 to 2016, and he began receiving injections in 2016. [PSMF ¶ 1]. Plaintiff saw his doctor on November 12, 2019, for a knee injury and that same month, Dr. Dale Lane, an expert in the field of orthopedics and the treatment of knees, diagnosed Plaintiff with tricompartmental disease and ordered knee replacement [*25]  surgery. [DSMF ¶ 12; PSMF ¶ 7]. In February 2020, Dr. Lane opined that from February 24, 2020 to April 20, 2020, Plaintiff had the following limitations: "no driving, no squatting kneeling, unable to walk long distance, unable to stand long . . . ambulatory aids, limit stair use." [DSMF ¶ 37; Doc. 63-3 at 6]. Plaintiff was on short-term disability from March to May 2020 and on long-term disability from June to September 2020. [DSMF ¶ 63]. Plaintiff's medical records indicate that as of July 28, 2020, he could not climb ladders or traverse unprotected heights for another six months. [DSMF ¶ 64]. In sum, Plaintiff began receiving injections in his knee in 2016, his doctor recommended knee surgery in November 2019, he had knee replacement surgery in February 2020, and he experienced substantial limitations for months after the surgery. Given the fact that the definition of disability must "be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals . . . to the maximum extent permitted by the terms" of the ADA, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiff's knee impairment constitutes a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A).
In the alternative, the Court also finds that Plaintiff is able to satisfy the requirement of "being [*26]  regarded as" disabled. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A). "An individual meets the requirement of 'being regarded as having such an impairment' if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited [by the ADA] because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A). An individual, however, will not be able to meet the requirement of being "regarded as" disabled if his impairment is "transitory and minor," that is, "an impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months or less." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(B). "[A] plaintiff need demonstrate only that the employer regarded him as being impaired, not that the employer believed the impairment prevented the plaintiff from performing a major life activity." Wolfe v. Postmaster Gen., 488 F. App'x 465, 468 (11th Cir. 2012); and see Dulaney v. Miami-Dade Cty., 481 F. App'x 486, 489 n.3 (11th Cir. 2012) ("In 2008, . . . Congress changed the definition of 'disability' such that being 'regarded as' having a disability no longer requires a showing that the employer perceived the individual to be substantially limited in a major life activity.").
Defendant argues Plaintiff was not regarded as disabled because his knee impairment was transitory and minor, but for the reasons discussed supra, the Court disagrees. [*27]  [Doc. 70-1 at 14 n.69]. Defendant also contends that AOCG did not perceive Plaintiff to have a disability until he called it to AOCG's attention in the form of a medical leave request. [Id.]. Another court within the Eleventh Circuit, however, recently addressed a similar situation and found that the plaintiff satisfied the "regarded as" prong. In E.E.O.C. v. Phoebe Putney Mem'l Hosp., Inc., 488 F. Supp. 3d 1336 (M.D. Ga. 2020), the court noted that the defendant/employer worked with the employee to develop a reasonable accommodation after the employee requested an accommodation related to her anxiety. Id. at 1350. The court found that in light of this evidence, "the evidence clearly demonstrates that [defendant/employer] regarded [employee] as impaired." Id.
In the present case, HR employee Shavon Bell sent Plaintiff an email on February 21, 2020, stating that AOCG's "initial decision still stands with regard to your leave denial." [Doc. 60-14]. Ms. Bell wrote that AOCG would be "unable to accommodate the limitations set forth by [Plaintiff's] doctor including no climbing, no lifting more than 5 lbs. and working from home." [PSMF ¶ 31; DSMF ¶ 56; Doc. 60-14]. Because the record reveals that Defendant "regarded [Plaintiff] as being impaired," the undersigned concludes that [*28]  Plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to establish this prima facie element. Wolfe, 488 F. App'x at 468.
The second prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that he is a "qualified individual," which the ADA defines as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "Courts consider the employer's judgment regarding whether a function is essential, as well as (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the individual to perform the function, (3) the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of individuals who held the job in the past, and (5) the work experience of individuals currently in similar jobs." Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 927-28 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1257-58). If a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of his job, even with a reasonable accommodation, [*29]  then he is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case. See Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).
Defendant AOCG argues in support of its summary judgment motion that the evidence in the record establishes that Plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" because he could not perform the essential functions of his job as a Field Supervisor. [Doc. 70-1 at 14-25]. Defendant asserts that a Field Supervisor oversees and inspects roofing projects at remote job sites and the job requires extensive driving. [Id. at 14-16]. Defendant contends that the essential duties of a Field Supervisor include climbing and lifting up to 50 pounds. [Id. at 14-16, 23-24]. Defendant states that Plaintiff's first leave request indicated that he would be out for two months with restrictions including no driving which, according to Defendant, would have required the company to transfer Plaintiff's duties to other employees because the Atlanta territory was too large for one Field Supervisor to cover. [Id. at 17-18]. Defendant also contends that Plaintiff's revised request was unreasonable because, although the request was shortened to five weeks, the doctor's note indicated that Plaintiff should be allowed to work from [*30]  home for an indefinite period of time. [Doc. 70-1 at 18-19].
Plaintiff Craven argues in support of his summary judgment motion that the evidence in the record establishes that he was a "qualified individual" because he could have performed the essential functions of his job as a Field Supervisor if Defendant had given him reasonable accommodations. [Doc. 69 at 7-11]. Plaintiff contends that providing him with five weeks of unpaid leave in response to his second leave request would have been a reasonable accommodation. [Id. at 7-10]. Plaintiff also asserts that he could have performed the essential functions of his job as of March 30, 2020 with, as Plaintiff wrote in an email to Ms. Bell on February 17, 2020, the following restrictions: "3 physical therapy appointments per week for 1 hour per day, no ladder climbing and no lifting over 5 pounds." [Doc. 60-10].
With respect to Defendant's summary judgment motion, the Court finds that a reasonable jury viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff could conclude that Plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to establish that he was capable of performing the essential functions of the Field Supervisor position. On February [*31]  6, 2020, Plaintiff completed a written form requesting eight weeks of leave (from February 24, 2020 to April 20, 2020) to rehab from his knee surgery. [PSMF ¶ 10; Doc. 63-3 at 3]. Attached to Plaintiff's leave request form was a statement completed by his physician, Dr. Dale Lane, which stated that Plaintiff's expected return-to-work date was April 20, 2020. [Doc. 63-3 at 6; DSMF ¶ 37]. Dr. Lane also wrote that Plaintiff had the following limitations and restrictions: "no driving, no squatting kneeling, unable to walk long distance, unable to stand long . . . ambulatory aids, limit stair use." [Doc. 63-3 at 6]. On February 17, 2020, Plaintiff sent an email to Ms. Bell stating the following, in part:
When I requested time off in my mind I thought I could be back in 4 weeks. I can't even drive for 4 weeks and I have staples for 3 weeks and Physical Therapy in my home for 4 weeks 3 days a week. Then I have Physical Therapy 3 times a week at the clinic up until May 2020. It's a possibility I could have returned with restrictions on 3-30-20 after I was released to drive. If anyone would have come to me weeks ago I could have ask my doctor. He was the one that put the 4-24-20 date I didn't [*32]  request that. If I returned 3-30-20 I would have restrictions 3 physical therapy appointments per week for 1 hour per day, no ladder climbing and no lifting over 5 pounds. I could work in office, scheduled work and materials, work from home as I do no after hours and drove to check jobs and crews. . . .
[Doc. 60-10 (errors in original)].
Plaintiff submitted a second Medical Leave Request Form and doctor's note via email on Thursday, February 20, 2020 at 4:23 p.m., the day before his last scheduled workday. [DSMF ¶ 50; PSMF ¶ 21; Doc. 60-13 at 2-7; Doc. 62-1 at 44-47]. In the revised leave request, Plaintiff stated that he anticipated returning to his normal work schedule and duties on March 30, 2020. [PSMF ¶ 28; Doc. 60-13 at 6; Doc. 62-1 at 46]. Attached to the leave request was a return-to-work note from Dr. Lane stating that Plaintiff could return to work on March 30, 2020, with the following work limitations: "No climbing, no lifting more than 5 lbs., allow patient to work from home and MUST attend scheduled PT sessions." [Doc. 60-13 at 7; Doc. 62-1 at 47 (emphasis in original); PSMF ¶ 22].
As previously noted, in determining whether a job function is essential, courts should consider, [*33]  inter alia, the employer's judgment, the amount of time spent performing the function, and the consequences of not requiring the employee to perform the function. See Anderson, 379 F. App'x at 927-28. Defendant argues that climbing and lifting were essential requirements of the Field Supervisor job; however, a jury could find otherwise. The Field Supervisor oversees jobs being performed by subcontractors and the position involves extensive driving to job sites. [DSMF ¶¶ 23, 24]. Job duties include administrative tasks, such as responding to emails and verifying invoices, and performing pre-, post-, and safety inspections at the job sites. [DSMF ¶¶ 27, 33]. AOCG's written job description of the Field Supervisor position does not list "ladder climbing," "lifting over 5 pounds," or getting on a roof as a job duty. [PSMF ¶ 19]. David Mendoza, an Atlanta Field Supervisor who worked for AOCG from some point in 2019 until March 2020, testified that the job could be performed without climbing ladders, getting on a roof, or getting in the attic. [PSMF ¶ 20; Mendoza Dec. ¶¶ 4-7]. Plaintiff testified that in the fifteen months he worked as a Field Supervisor in the Atlanta branch, from December 2018 to February 2020, he climbed [*34]  a ladder twice. [Pla. Dep. at 63-65]. In addition, Plaintiff testified that he lifted more than five pounds while working only about "once a month or something, just if somebody forgot something at the office." [Pla. Dep. at 136-37]. This evidence would support a reasonable finding that climbing and lifting were not essential functions of the Field Supervisor position.
The Eleventh Circuit has held that "an extended leave of absence of a definite duration, as opposed to an indefinite duration, may be a reasonable accommodation in certain circumstances." Spears v. Creel, 607 F. App'x 943, 950 (11th Cir. 2015). On two occasions, Plaintiff requested Defendant to provide him with accommodations for his knee impairment in the form of leave from work for a definite period of time. Plaintiff never requested a leave of indefinite duration. Plaintiff also specifically wrote, "I could work in office, schedule[] work and materials, work from home as I do no[w] after hours and [drive] to check jobs and crews." [Doc. 60-10]. A reasonable factfinder viewing these facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff could conclude that he was able to perform the essential functions of the Field Supervisor job with a reasonable accommodation from Defendant in [*35]  the form of a short period of leave from work. As a result, with respect to Defendant's summary judgment motion, Plaintiff is able to establish the "qualified individual" prima facie element and Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment based on this issue.
However, when analyzing Plaintiff's summary judgment motion, the court must resolve all reasonable inferences against Plaintiff and in favor of Defendant. The undersigned concludes that a reasonable jury, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendant, could find that Plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of the Field Supervisor position. As previously noted, Plaintiff submitted medical leave requests on February 6 and 20, 2020, asking for weeks of leave and listing job restrictions which were necessary after his knee surgery. [PSMF ¶¶ 10, 21; Doc. 63-3 at 3; DSMF ¶ 50; Doc. 60-13 at 2-7; Doc. 62-1 at 44-47]. Attached to Plaintiff's leave request forms were notes from Dr. Lane stating that Plaintiff had numerous limitations and restrictions. In the first leave request, Dr. Lane indicated that Plaintiff had the following restrictions: "no driving, no squatting kneeling, unable to walk long [*36]  distance, unable to stand long . . . ambulatory aids, limit stair use." [Doc. 63-3 at 6]. In the second request, Dr. Lane gave the following work limitations: "No climbing, no lifting more than 5 lbs., allow patient to work from home and MUST attend scheduled PT sessions." [Doc. 60-13 at 7; Doc. 62-1 at 47 (emphasis in original); PSMF ¶ 22]. The second note from Dr. Lane did not state the restrictions' duration. [Doc. 62-1 at 47; PSMF ¶¶ 25, 26].
Although Plaintiff requested weeks' worth of leave with many restrictions, as well as the option to work from home, the Field Supervisor's duties include pre-inspections, safety inspections, and post-inspections, all of which are performed at the job site. [DSMF ¶¶ 28-30]. The Field Supervisor oversees jobs being performed by subcontractors and involves extensive driving to job sites. [DSMF ¶¶ 23, 24]. Plaintiff stated that he drove six hours per day. [DSMF ¶ 24]. When Plaintiff's second leave request was denied, HR employee Shavon Bell informed Plaintiff via email, "Many of the essential duties of a Field Supervisor involve being in the field . . . so working from home would not be something [AOCG] can accommodate at this point in time." [PSMF [*37]  ¶ 31; DSMF ¶ 56; Doc. 60-14].
Ms. Bell also informed Plaintiff that his leave request was denied because AOCG would be "unable to accommodate the limitations set forth by [Plaintiff's] doctor including no climbing [and] no lifting more than 5 lbs." [Id.]. Plaintiff contends that the Field Supervisor job requires almost no lifting or climbing, but a reasonable jury viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendant could find that lifting and climbing were essential functions of the job. AOCG Director of Operations Stuart Greifinger testified that Field Supervisors were required to pick up products and materials and take them to and from job sites, and the materials often weigh between ten and sixty pounds. [Greifinger Dep. at 72]. Mr. Greifinger also testified that Field Supervisors were required to climb. [Id. at 103]. Furthermore, medical records reveal that Plaintiff himself informed his health care providers that his work duties "entail climbing" and that he "has to be able to climb ladders at work." [Doc. 64-4 at 3; Doc. 64-8 at 1, 3].
The Court concludes that based on these facts, a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions [*38]  of the Field Supervisor position. A factfinder could conclude that the essential functions of the job required extensive driving, being on job sites rather than working from home, and climbing and lifting. In particular, a jury viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendant could credit Plaintiff's statement that the duties of the Field Supervisor position "entail climbing" and that he "has to be able to climb ladders at work." And given the numerous restrictions and limitations described by Dr. Lane, a reasonable jury could also conclude that Plaintiff was not able to carry out the essential functions of a Field Supervisor, with or without a reasonable accommodation, because of his knee impairment.
Defendant, like Plaintiff, has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff was a "qualified individual" under the ADA. Because Plaintiff has not established as a matter of law that he was a "qualified individual," he is not entitled to judgment in his favor at this stage of the litigation. It is, therefore, RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's motion [Doc. 69] for summary judgment be DENIED on his ADA termination claim. [Doc. 1, Count I]. [*39] 
With respect to Defendant's summary judgment motion, as previously noted, Plaintiff is able to establish the first two prima facie elements in support of his disability termination claim. The final prima facie element requires Plaintiff to offer evidence which would permit a reasonable jury to find that he was terminated because of his disability. The Eleventh Circuit has held that a plaintiff may satisfy this element by showing that his employer treated "similarly situated" employees outside his protected class more favorably. See Lewis v. City of Union City, Georgia, 918 F.3d 1213, 1220-21, 1235 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc). Even if a plaintiff is unable to identify a similarly situated comparator, the Eleventh Circuit has made it clear that the "failure to produce a comparator does not necessarily doom the plaintiff's case." Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011). Summary judgment is improper "if the record, viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, presents a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the decisionmaker." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In support of his disability termination claim, Plaintiff Craven cites to Defendant's letter denying his revised leave request. [Doc. 69 at 17-19]. On February [*40]  21, 2020, shortly after Plaintiff sent Defendant his revised request, HR employee Shavon Bell sent Plaintiff an email stating that AOCG's "initial decision still stands with regard to your leave denial." [Doc. 60-14]. Ms. Bell also wrote in the email that AOCG would be "unable to accommodate the limitations set forth by [Plaintiff's] doctor including no climbing, no lifting more than 5 lbs. and working from home. Many of the essential duties of a Field Supervisor involve being in the field and climbing so working from home would not be something [AOCG] can accommodate at this point in time." [PSMF ¶ 31; DSMF ¶ 56; Doc. 60-14]. Defendant AOCG terminated Plaintiff's employment on February 21, 2020, the same day Ms. Bell sent the email. [DSMF ¶¶ 3, 9, 56, 57].
In its summary judgment motion, Defendant AOCG does not contend that Plaintiff is unable to establish the final prima facie element. [Doc. 70-1]. Defendant only moves for summary judgment on the first two prima facie elements; that is, Defendant contends that Plaintiff was not disabled and was not a qualified individual.3 [Id. at 10-25]. "Because the Court has already determined that whether Plaintiff was a qualified individual is [*41]  a material fact in dispute, the case is not due to be dismissed on that basis." Abdur-Rahman v. Dekalb County, No. 1:18-CV-00252-AT-LTW, 2019 WL 12494879, at *17 (N.D. Ga. July 17, 2019), report and recommendation adopted sub nom. Abdur-Rahman v. DeKalb County, Georgia, No. 1:18-CV-00252-AT, 2019 WL 12494878 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 25, 2019). Moreover, as discussed infra, Plaintiff has offered circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent.
Plaintiff argues that the February 21 email from Ms. Bell constitutes direct evidence of discrimination. [Doc. 69 at 16-18]. The undersigned does not agree. "Direct evidence of discrimination is evidence which reflects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude correlating to the discrimination or retaliation complained of by the employee and that, if believed, proves the existence of a fact without inference or presumption." Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., 680 F.3d 1316, 1320 (11th Cir. 2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Florida, Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1358 (11th Cir. 1999) ("We have defined direct evidence of discrimination as evidence which reflects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude correlating to the discrimination or retaliation complained of by the employee."). Eleventh Circuit precedent establishes that "only the most blatant remarks, whose intent could mean nothing other than to discriminate on the basis of some impermissible factor constitute direct evidence of discrimination." Akouri v. State of Florida Dep't of Transp., 408 F.3d 1338, 1347 (11th Cir. 2005) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). [*42] 
Plaintiff, in support of his argument that he has offered direct evidence of discrimination, cites to Perez v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., No. 1:12-CV-3161-MHS, 2013 WL 6970898 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 19, 2013). [Doc. 69 at 17]. In Perez, the plaintiff brought an ADA disability termination claim and offered evidence that a decision-maker wrote the following to an HR employee: "Is this verbiage ok for me to write in the section for circumstances of separation: Due to medical disabilities, employee is unable to perform specific responsibilities of his job. Just want to make sure I word it properly for legal." Id. at *9. The HR employee responded by saying not to mention plaintiff's medical situation or disability but only to write that the "employee is unable to perform the essential/required functions of his position." Id. The Perez court found that the original statement constituted direct evidence of disability discrimination because, "[e]ven though she changed the language on the form, [the decision-maker] made the comment about plaintiff's removal from Sprint due to his medical disabilities in the context of terminating plaintiff." Id. at *10.
The present case is distinguishable from Perez. Here, Ms. Bell wrote in the email to Plaintiff on February 21, 2020, that Defendant AOCG would be "unable to accommodate [*43]  the limitations set forth by [Plaintiff's] doctor including no climbing, no lifting more than 5 lbs. and working from home" because "[m]any of the essential duties of a Field Supervisor involve being in the field and climbing so working from home would not be something [AOCG] can accommodate at this point in time." [PSMF ¶ 31; DSMF ¶ 56; Doc. 60-14]. The February 21st email could suggest discriminatory motive in the termination decision based on Plaintiff's disability for the reasons discussed below. But the email could also be interpreted as a statement indicating that Defendant was unable to accommodate the restrictions outlined by Plaintiff's physician. "'Evidence that only suggests discrimination or that is subject to more than one interpretation does not constitute direct evidence.'" Taylor v. Runyon, 175 F.3d 861, 867 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co., 120 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir. 1997)). The February 21st email does not constitute direct evidence because it only suggests disability discrimination.
The Court, nevertheless, finds that the email from Ms. Bell constitutes circumstantial evidence of discrimination because it does create an inference that Plaintiff was terminated because of his disability. [DSMF ¶¶ 3, 9, 56, 57]. As discussed supra, the evidence viewed in the [*44]  light most favorable to Plaintiff reveals that he had a disability in the form of a knee impairment, he had restrictions and limitations related to his disability, he performed his Field Supervisor job in a satisfactory manner prior to his knee surgery, and he could have continued to perform the job with reasonable accommodations. Plaintiff also correctly points out that Defendant does not allege that Plaintiff was terminated for a rule violation, performance deficiencies, downsizing, or any other legitimate non-discriminatory reason. [Doc. 69 at 18]. Instead, the February 21, 2020 email from Ms. Bell to Plaintiff reveals that AOCG terminated Plaintiff's employment because the company would not be able to accommodate the limitations resulting from his knee impairment after surgery. [Doc. 60-14]. In addition, the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment occurred immediately after he requested accommodations to his disability. A reasonable jury examining this non-comparator evidence could conclude that Defendant made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment because of his disability-related restrictions. See Chapter 7 Tr. v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 683 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir. 2012) (finding non-comparator evidence of discriminatory intent in decision-maker's [*45]  comments that "he knew [employee] was pregnant, that eventually she would be unable to handle her job duties because of her pregnancy, and that [employer] had no light-duty job available for her if she could not do her job as a customer service representative").
In sum, Plaintiff is able to establish all three prima facie elements in support of his disability-based discriminatory termination claim. Defendant AOCG, as previously noted, does not address the final prima facie element in its summary judgment motion, and Defendant does not assert that it terminated Plaintiff's employment for violating a work rule or for any other legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. [Doc. 70-1]. Plaintiff's prima facie case remains unrebutted. For these reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 70] be DENIED on Plaintiff's ADA termination claim [Doc. 1, Count I].

B. Failure to Accommodate Claim
Plaintiff Craven alleges in Count II of his Complaint that Defendant AOCG violated the ADA because it failed to provide a reasonable accommodation to his disability. [Doc. 1, Count II]. As previously noted, to establish a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination, [*46]  a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he has a disability as defined in the ADA; (2) he is a "qualified individual"; and (3) "he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability." Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1267-68 (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256). The ADA's definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of an individual with a disability.4 See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
Both Plaintiff and Defendant are moving for summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate claim. [Doc. 69 at 5-16; Doc. 70-1 at 9-29]. The definition of disability, as previously noted, must "be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals . . . to the maximum extent permitted by the terms" of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A). The Court has found that Plaintiff is able to establish the first prima facie element because his knee impairment constitutes a disability.
The second prima facie element requires Plaintiff to demonstrate that he is a "qualified individual." With regard to Plaintiff's summary judgment motion, the Court has concluded that a reasonable jury viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendant could find that Plaintiff has not established this prima facie element. As discussed supra, a factfinder [*47]  could conclude that the Field Supervisor position required extensive driving, being on job sites rather than working from home, climbing, and lifting. Plaintiff himself stated that he drove six hours per day and he represented to medical providers that the duties of the Field Supervisor position "entail climbing" and that he "has to be able to climb ladders at work." [DSMF ¶ 24; Doc. 64-4 at 3; Doc. 64-8 at 1, 3]. In addition, Plaintiff's treating physician, Dr. Dale Lane, described numerous restrictions and limitations in his notes, and a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff was not able to carry out the essential functions of a Field Supervisor, with or without a reasonable accommodation, because of his knee impairment. Plaintiff has not established as a matter of law that he was a "qualified individual" under the ADA for the reasons discussed supra; therefore, he is not entitled to judgment in his favor. It is RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff Craven's motion [Doc. 69] for summary judgment be DENIED on his ADA failure to accommodate claim. [Doc. 1, Count II].
The next issue to be addressed is whether Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for failure to [*48]  accommodate. As previously discussed, Plaintiff is able to establish the "qualified individual" prima facie element. The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff would permit a reasonable jury to find that he was capable of performing the essential functions of the Field Supervisor position with reasonable accommodations.
The final element necessary to establish a prima facie case under the ADA requires Plaintiff to show that he was discriminated against because of his disability. See Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268. As noted supra, a failure to make a reasonable accommodation to the limitations of an individual with a disability falls within the ADA's definition of discrimination. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "Thus, an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and unless the employer can show undue hardship." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262 (emphasis in original). A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b). An [*49]  employer is not required, however, to provide an employee with "'the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible.'" Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 947 (N.D. Ga. 1995)).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of [his] job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367. Thus, "[t]he plaintiff bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the employee desires." Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 500 F. App'x 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86). "Moreover, an employer's 'duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made.'" Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999)). The Eleventh Circuit has indicated that "for a demand to be specific enough to trigger the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation, the defendant 'must have enough information to know of both the disability and desire for an accommodation, or circumstances must at least be sufficient to cause a reasonable [employer] to make appropriate inquiries about the possible [*50]  need for an accommodation.'" United States v. Hialeah Housing Authority, 418 F. App'x 872, 876 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (quoting Colwell v. Rite Aid Corp., 602 F.3d 495, 506 (3d Cir. 2010)).
An employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify his limitations and possible accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). But when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "'the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant.'" Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id.; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 F. App'x 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) (holding that "where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In the present case, Plaintiff Craven argues Defendant AOCG failed to make a reasonable accommodation to the limitations of his disability when the company denied his requests for leave from work and his requests to return to work with various restrictions. [Doc. 75 at 22-26]. Plaintiff's first leave request was completed on February 6, 2020. [*51]  At that time, Plaintiff requested eight weeks of leave (from February 24, 2020 to April 20, 2020) to rehab from his knee surgery. [PSMF ¶ 10; Doc. 63-3 at 3]. Attached to the request form was a statement completed by Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Dale Lane, which stated that Plaintiff's expected return-to-work date was April 20, 2020. [Doc. 63-3 at 6; DSMF ¶ 37]. Dr. Lane also wrote that Plaintiff had the following limitations and restrictions: "no driving, no squatting kneeling, unable to walk long distance, unable to stand long . . . ambulatory aids, limit stair use." [Doc. 63-3 at 6].
On February 17, 2020, Plaintiff sent an email to HR employee Shavon Bell which stated the following, in part:
When I requested time off in my mind I thought I could be back in 4 weeks. I can't even drive for 4 weeks and I have staples for 3 weeks and Physical Therapy in my home for 4 weeks 3 days a week. Then I have Physical Therapy 3 times a week at the clinic up until May 2020. It's a possibility I could have returned with restrictions on 3-30-20 after I was released to drive. If anyone would have come to me weeks ago I could have ask my doctor. He was the one that put the 4-24-20 date I didn't request [*52]  that. If I returned 3-30-20 I would have restrictions 3 physical therapy appointments per week for 1 hour per day, no ladder climbing and no lifting over 5 pounds. I could work in office, scheduled work and materials, work from home as I do no after hours and drove to check jobs and crews. . . .
[Doc. 60-10 (errors in original)]. On February 20, 2020, three days after he sent this email, Plaintiff submitted a revised leave request. [DSMF ¶ 50; PSMF ¶ 21; Doc. 60-13 at 2-7; Doc. 62-1 at 44-47]. In the revised leave request, Plaintiff stated that he anticipated returning to his normal work schedule and duties on March 30, 2020. [PSMF ¶ 28; Doc. 60-13 at 6; Doc. 62-1 at 46]. Attached to the revised leave request was a note from Dr. Lane stating that Plaintiff could return to work on March 30, 2020 with the following work limitations: "No climbing, no lifting more than 5 lbs., allow patient to work from home and MUST attend scheduled PT sessions." [Doc. 60-13 at 7; Doc. 62-1 at 47 (emphasis in original); PSMF ¶ 22].
Defendant argues Plaintiff's first leave request was unreasonable because it would have required him to be on leave for two months, and the Atlanta branch where Plaintiff worked [*53]  had only one other Field Supervisor. [Doc. 70-1 at 17-18]. The deficiency in Defendant's argument on this issue is, as previously noted, the Eleventh Circuit has held that "an extended leave of absence of a definite duration, as opposed to an indefinite duration, may be a reasonable accommodation in certain circumstances." Spears, 607 F. App'x at 950. Plaintiff made a specific request for an accommodation which would have resulted in him being on leave for eight weeks. Plaintiff testified that shortly after he began working as a Field Supervisor at the Atlanta branch in December 2018, he covered the entire state of Georgia by himself for about four months. [Pla. Dep. at 44-45, 50-52]. Given the fact that AOCG had one Field Supervisor covering all of Georgia for four months, a jury could find that providing Plaintiff with eight weeks of leave while reallocating his responsibilities would be a reasonable accommodation.
Defendant also contends that Plaintiff's first request was unreasonable because, not only would AOCG have been required to reallocate Plaintiff's job duties for two months, but upon his return to work, the company would have had to eliminate the essential function of driving or transfer it to another [*54]  employee. [Doc. 70-1 at 18]. The Court agrees with Defendant on this issue. Dr. Lane's statement attached to Plaintiff's first request indicated that in addition to eight weeks of leave, Plaintiff had the following limitations and restrictions: "no driving, no squatting kneeling, unable to walk long distance, unable to stand long . . . ambulatory aids, limit stair use." [Doc. 63-3 at 6]. The only reasonable interpretation of Dr. Lane's statement is that after Plaintiff returned to work, he would not be able to drive. However, the record reveals that the Field Supervisor position involves extensive driving to job sites. [DSMF ¶¶ 23, 24]. Plaintiff, in fact, stated that he drove six hours per day. [DSMF ¶ 24].
There is no indication in Dr. Lane's statement that Plaintiff's inability to drive was limited to a definite duration. Furthermore, in Plaintiff's response to Defendant's summary judgment motion, Plaintiff does not address the "no driving" limitation in the first request. [Doc. 75 at 22-23]. For these reasons, and because the Field Supervisor position required a significant amount of driving, the Court finds that with respect to Plaintiff's first request, he did not carry his "burden [*55]  of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow [him] to perform the job[.]" Gilliard, 500 F. App'x at 868. It is, therefore, RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion [Doc. 70] for summary judgment be GRANTED on Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate claim [Doc. 1, Count II] to the extent it is based on his first leave request submitted on February 6, 2020. The Court next turns to Plaintiff's revised leave request.
In his revised request submitted on February 20, 2020, Plaintiff stated that he anticipated returning to his normal work schedule and duties on March 30, 2020. [DSMF ¶ 50; PSMF ¶¶ 21, 28; Doc. 60-13 at 6; Doc. 62-1 at 46]. Dr. Lane's note attached to the request stated that Plaintiff could return to work on March 30, 2020 with the following work limitations: "No climbing, no lifting more than 5 lbs., allow patient to work from home and MUST attend scheduled PT sessions." [Doc. 60-13 at 7; Doc. 62-1 at 47 (emphasis in original); PSMF ¶ 22]. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's request was unreasonable because Dr. Lane's note indicated that Plaintiff should be allowed to work from home for an indefinite period of time. [Doc. 70-1 at 18-22]. The Court disagrees and finds that Plaintiff's revised request [*56]  was both specific and identified a reasonable accommodation that would allow him to perform the Field Supervisor job.5
Although Defendant asserts that Dr. Lane's note indicated that Plaintiff's work-from-home restriction would continue indefinitely, a reasonable factfinder could examine the relevant evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff and conclude that Dr. Lane was not stating that Plaintiff was required to work from home all day for an indefinite period of time. [Doc. 70-1 at 18-22]. Dr. Lane stated Plaintiff could return to work on March 30, 2020; however, he could do no climbing.6 [Doc. 60-13 at 7; Doc. 62-1 at 47 (emphasis in original); PSMF ¶ 22]. But if Plaintiff were required by Dr. Lane to work from home indefinitely all the time, the climbing limitation would be superfluous. In other words, if, as Defendant argues, Dr. Lane was saying that Plaintiff must only work at home and he must do this indefinitely, the physician's statement restricting Plaintiff to "no climbing" would be completely unnecessary because there would be no scenario in which Plaintiff would be working from home all the time and also climbing ladders to inspect roofs. A reasonable interpretation [*57]  of Dr. Lane's note is that he was suggesting Defendant AOCG to allow Plaintiff to work from home when possible.
There is additional evidence supporting this interpretation of Dr. Lane's note. On February 17, 2020, just a few days before AOCG received Plaintiff's revised request, Plaintiff sent an email to HR employee Shavon Bell. In the email, Plaintiff informed Ms. Bell of the following:
If I returned 3-30-20 I would have restrictions 3 physical therapy appointments per week for 1 hour per day, no ladder climbing and no lifting over 5 pounds. I could work in office, scheduled work and materials, work from home as I do no after hours and drove to check jobs and crews. . . .
[Doc. 60-10 (errors in original)]. Ms. Bell testified that she understood Plaintiff meant that he could work from home "as I do now," instead of "as I do no." [Bell Dep. at 114]. Ms. Bell also testified that she believed Plaintiff intended to say "drive" to check jobs and crews, rather than "drove." [Id.]. Therefore, a reasonable understanding of Plaintiff's email is: he could work in the office; he could work from home after hours as he was currently doing; he could drive to job sites to check jobs and work crews; [*58]  he would have three appointments per week for one hour each appointment; and he could do no ladder climbing and no lifting over five pounds. The restrictions as outlined by Plaintiff in this email are virtually identical to those described by Dr. Lane in his note. However, HR Director Crystal Brookshire testified that the information provided by Plaintiff in his February 17th email was not considered by the company. Ms. Brookshire was asked and testified to the following:
Q. [W]as the information provided by Mr. Craven as part of the interactive process, the accommodation offer, quote, If I returned 3/30/20, I would have restrictions of three physical therapy appointments per week for one hour per day, no ladder climbing and no lifting over 5 pounds, did that present an undue hardship to the company?
A. That wasn't the full story so we didn't evaluate that part.
[Brookshire Dep. at 76-77].
The Court finds that Plaintiff's revised leave request sent to Defendant on February 20, 2020, in conjunction with Plaintiff's email sent to Ms. Bell on February 17, 2020, identified a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed him to perform the Field Supervisor job. A reasonable jury viewing [*59]  the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff could conclude that his email and Dr. Lane's note were asking Defendant to provide Plaintiff with leave for five weeks, and then afterwards, allow him to attend physical therapy sessions, work from home when possible, with additional restrictions of no climbing ladders and no lifting more than five pounds.7 Given the lack of consideration that was apparently given to Plaintiff's February 17th email, a jury could also find that Defendant did not sufficiently engage in an informal, interactive process to identify Plaintiff's limitations and possible accommodations. Because Plaintiff has carried his burden of identifying reasonable accommodations that would allow him to perform the essential functions of his job, the Court finds that with regard to Plaintiff's revised leave request, he has established a prima facie case of failure to accommodate.
"Once the plaintiff has met [his] burden of proving that reasonable accommodations exist, the defendant-employer may present evidence that the plaintiff's requested accommodation imposes an undue hardship on the employer." Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998). "[E]stablishing that a reasonable accommodation exists is part [*60]  of an ADA plaintiff's case, whereas undue hardship is an affirmative defense to be pled and proven by an ADA defendant." Willis, 108 F.3d at 286. "To meet its burden of proof, the employer 'must show special (typically case-specific) circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship in the particular circumstances.'" Davis v. Columbus Consol. Gov't, 826 F. App'x 890, 893 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 402 (2002)). "Undue hardship, everyone agrees, is a complete defense to ADA liability." EEOC v. St. Joseph's Hosp. Inc., 842 F.3d 1333, 1349 (11th Cir. 2016). The Eleventh Circuit has explained:
The ADA defines "undue hardship" as "an action requiring significant difficulty or expense" when considered along with the following factors: (1) the nature and cost of the reasonable accommodation; (2) the overall financial resources and number of employees of the affected facility, and the effect that the reasonable accommodation would have on the facility's expenses and resources or other impacts on the operation of such facilities; (3) the employer's overall financial resources, number and type of facilities, and number of employees; and (4) the type of operation run by the employer, "including the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce" as well as "the geographic separateness, administrative, or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question" [*61]  to the employer.
Davis, 826 F. App'x at 893 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(10)(A)-(B)).
In the present case, Defendant AOCG argues the accommodations requested by Plaintiff in his revised leave request would have caused the company an undue hardship. [Doc. 70-1 at 25-29]. Defendant cites to the following evidence in support of its "undue hardship" argument. The AOCG Atlanta branch is a small office with only two Field Supervisors. [Doc. 70-1 at 27]. AOCG Atlanta branch employees would have been stretched trying to cover all projects in the Atlanta area while performing their own jobs. [Id.]. Plaintiff's duties would have had to be performed by the other Field Supervisor, the Branch Manager, or an employee from another market. [Id.]. Defendant also asserts that AOCG would have had to incur costs to transfer another employee to Atlanta and the company would have had to cover the employee's job in their home market. [Doc. 70-1 at 28]. Finally, AOCG would have had to pay Plaintiff while he was performing administrative work at home, and the company would have experienced lost business opportunities and customer dissatisfaction. [Id. at 28-29].
Although Defendant's arguments are not completely meritless, for a number of reasons, the Court finds that [*62]  a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff's requested accommodations would not have imposed an undue hardship on AOCG. When Plaintiff was informed on February 21, 2020, that his revised leave request had been denied, HR employee Shavon Bell sent Plaintiff an email saying the reason for the denial was that AOCG was unable to accommodate the limitations described by Dr. Dale Lane, including no climbing, no lifting more than five pounds, and working from home. [Doc. 60-14]. But there was nothing in the denial notice indicating that AOCG would experience hardship as a result of Plaintiff's leave. This is in contrast to Defendant's response to Plaintiff's first leave request, in which Ms. Bell informed Plaintiff of the following in a letter on February 14, 2020: "[AOCG] will not be able to approve your absence for the length of leave requested. It presents an undue hardship on the business to be functional without your position for the 3 months requested." [PSMF ¶ 11; Doc. 60-7 at 1].
As previously discussed, a reasonable interpretation of both Dr. Lane's note and Plaintiff's email sent to Ms. Bell on February 17, 2020, is that Plaintiff was requesting five weeks of leave, and then afterwards, [*63]  he was seeking to attend physical therapy sessions, work from home when possible, with additional restrictions of no climbing ladders and no lifting more than five pounds. Atlanta Branch Manager Javier Ruiz testified that he was not consulted by HR about Plaintiff's five-week leave request, and that he was unaware of any "significant expense or difficulty Alpha Omega would incur from allowing Mr. Craven to have five weeks of unpaid leave[.]" [Ruiz Dep. at 107-08]. In addition, relevant evidence would support a finding that a five-week leave of absence would not impose undue hardship on Defendant. AOCG employed approximately thirty roofing Field Supervisors in its eleven branches, and one of the written essential duties of the job was "[t]ravels to other markets as needed." [Greifinger Dep. at 13-19; Doc. 63-1 at 5]. Field Supervisors sometimes traveled from one branch to another to assist with the work. [Bell Dep. at 47-49].
Moreover, the record reveals that a Field Supervisor from the Greensboro branch, which is similar in size to AOCG's Atlanta branch, was approved for four and a half weeks of leave in the spring of 2019. [Brookshire Dep. at 16-18, 41-44; Doc. 60-1]. Other employees [*64]  covered the duties of the Field Supervisor while he was on extended leave, and AOCG did not experience any significant difficulty or expense as a result of the leave. [Id.]. Finally, Plaintiff testified that shortly after he began working as a Field Supervisor at the Atlanta branch in December 2018, he covered the entire state of Georgia by himself for about four months. [Pla. Dep. at 44-45, 50-52]. A reasonable factfinder could examine this evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff and conclude that his revised leave request for five weeks of leave with additional limitations upon his return would not have imposed an undue hardship on Defendant AOCG.
In sum, Plaintiff Craven has identified a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed him to perform the Field Supervisor job and he has established a prima facie case of failure to accommodate with regard to his revised leave request. Defendant AOCG has not carried its burden of showing that the requested accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship on the company. For these reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion [Doc. 70] for summary judgment be DENIED on Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate [*65]  claim [Doc. 1, Count II] to the extent it is based on his revised leave request submitted on February 20, 2020.

IV. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing reasons and cited authority, the Court RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff Marvin Craven's motion [Doc. 69] for summary judgment be DENIED in its entirety.
The Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant AOCG's motion [Doc. 70] for summary judgment be GRANTED on Plaintiffs ADA failure to accommodate claim [Doc. 1, Count II] to the extent it is based on his first leave request submitted on February 6, 2020. The Court further RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 70] be DENIED on Plaintiffs ADA termination claim [Doc. 1, Count I] and on Plaintiffs ADA failure to accommodate claim [Doc. 1, Count II] to the extent it is based on his revised leave request submitted on February 20, 2020.
As this is a Final Report and Recommendation and there are no other matters pending before this Court, the Clerk is directed to terminate the reference to the undersigned.
SO REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED, this 22 day of September, 2021.
