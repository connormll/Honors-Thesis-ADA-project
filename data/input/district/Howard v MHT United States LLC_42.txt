MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Gary Howard ("Howard") brings this action against MHT USA LLC ("MHT"), alleging claims of disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., as well as claims of interference and retaliation, in violation of the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq., and the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act ("EPSLA"), a component of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act ("FFCRA"), Pub. L. No. 116-127, 134 Stat. 178 (2020). [Doc. 1].1 MHT moves for summary judgment on Howard's claims, [Doc. 35], which Howard opposes, [Doc. 36]. MHT has filed a reply in support of its motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 40], and for the reasons that follow, it is RECOMMENDED that MHT's motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 35], be GRANTED.

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

A. Preliminary Procedural Issues
"In this District, the process for separating disputed from undisputed material facts is governed by Local Rule 56.1(B)." Brandon v. Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Sys., 393 F. Supp. 2d 1341, 1347 (N.D. Ga. 2005), adopted at 1345; see also Dobson v. Fulton Cnty., CIVIL CASE NO. 1:19-cv-00902-ELR-RGV, 2020 WL 5549246, at *2 (N.D. Ga. July 9, 2020) (citation omitted), adopted by 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173163, 2020 WL 5548771, at *7 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 31, 2020) [*2] . In compliance with Local Rule 56.1(B)(1), MHT, as movant, filed a statement of undisputed material facts, [Doc. 35-1], and Howard has responded, [Doc. 37]. Howard also filed a statement of undisputed material facts, [Doc. 38], to which MHT has responded, [Doc. 39].2 The Court therefore accepts as undisputed those facts which the parties admit or have failed to properly dispute or deny. See [Doc. 37, admitting or failing to properly dispute or deny ¶¶ 1-19, 21-27, 29-39, 41-46, 48-84, 86-87, 89-94, and parts of ¶¶ 20, 40, 47, and 88 of MHT's statement, Doc. 35-1; Doc. 39, admitting or failing to properly dispute or deny ¶¶ 1-5, 7, 12-18, 21, 26, and parts of ¶¶ 6, 8-11, 19-20, 22-25, 27, and 29-31 of Howard's statement, Doc. 38]. The Court, however, has omitted certain facts which are not material to the issues presented in the pending motion for summary judgment, were stated as an issue or legal conclusion, or were not supported by citations to evidence. See LR 56.1(B)(1), (2)(a)(2), NDGa. Nevertheless, as required on a motion for summary judgment, the Court construes the following pertinent facts in the light most favorable to Howard as the non-moving party. Cotton v. Enmarket Inc, 809 F. App'x 723, 724 (11th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); see also Whitehead v. BBVA Compass Bank, 979 F.3d 1327, 1328 (11th Cir. 2020) (citations omitted); Rose v. Wal-Mart Stores E., Inc., 631 F. App'x 796, 798 (11th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted).3

B. Statement of Facts and Procedural History
On March 26, 2019, MHT, a direct seller of packaging molds and provider of process improvement and design services to clients in the food and beverage and special application industries, hired Howard as a full-time Project Manager at its Peachtree City, Georgia, office. [Doc. 35-3 (Pl.'s Dep.) at 19 p. 18, 47-48 pp. 46-47; Doc. 35-4 (Krampe Dep.) at 9 p. 8]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 3-4; Doc. 35-3 at 46 p. 45].4 Howard interviewed with Andreas Krampe ("Krampe"), MHT's CEO, and Krampe offered the Project Manager position to Howard, who began his employment with MHT on April 8, 2019, and directly reported to Krampe, who in turn reported to Wagner. [Doc. 35-3 at 18-19 pp. 17-18, 22 p. 21, 48 p. 47, 50 p. 49; Doc. 35-4 at 8 p. 7, 11 p. 10]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 27]. As a full-time Project Manager, Howard was expected to work 40 hours per week, Monday through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., at MHT's Peachtree City office, which employed three to four employees who also physically reported to the office,5 and he was eligible for 10 days of vacation time and 6 days of paid time [*3]  off ("PTO"). [Doc. 35-3 at 20 p. 19, 49 p. 48; Doc. 35-4 at 11-12 pp. 10-11]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 3-4, 27]. Howard's job duties as a Project Manager included assisting Krampe with managing projects in the North and Central Americas, which primarily consisted of ensuring that all client projects were delivered on time and within scope, communicating clear information for project development to the headquarters team in a timely manner, developing detailed project plans to track progress and follow up, and creating and maintaining comprehensive project documentation, among other responsibilities. [Doc. 35-3 at 19 p. 18, 49 p. 48]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 4-5, 29].6
On Howard's first day on the job on April 8, 2019, Krampe met with Howard and explained his expectations for the Project Manager position, defined the position details and daily tasks, and outlined internal objectives and deadlines. [Doc. 35-3 at 50 p. 49]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 5, 32-33]. During Howard's employment, MHT experienced an increase in business that resulted in longer hours at the office for all employees, including Howard, but Howard believed the increase in business "was going well" and that MHT was "flourishing," [*4]  especially given that MHT had invested money into his programs. [Doc. 35-3 at 36 p. 35, 39 p. 38].7
In the course of Howard's employment, Krampe assigned Howard a task of creating a basic project process and procedural manual for MHT to follow and gave him a deadline of September 30, 2019. [Doc. 35-3 at 53-54 pp. 52-53]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 5]. Despite Krampe's instructions, Howard did not meet the September 30 deadline. [Doc. 35-3 at 54 p. 53]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 5]. Krampe then extended the deadline through the end of March 2020. [Doc. 35-3 at 55 p. 54]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 5].8
On October 11, 2019, Howard enabled an automatic "out of office" message for his email messages, indicating that he would be out of the office until October 15, 2019. [Doc. 35-3 at 58 p. 57]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 5, 36]. After receiving the automatic "out of office" reply to an email, Krampe followed up with an email on October 11, stating, "You will have to request a vacation day or at least communicate with me if you are out of the office! Please use our official 'out of office' message, if you are out. Thanks and have fun!" [Doc. 35-2 at 36; Doc. 35-3 at 58 p. 57]. Howard responded that [*5]  day, with Wagner and another individual copied thereon, stating in relevant part:
Hi [Krampe],
We did have a conversation twice about taking today off. It's a comp day for one of the 8 days I worked over on the weekends for the first western project.
But let's scratch that I'll enter a regular day into Tri[N]et.
That leaves me with 11 days vacation this year to take and the 8 days of comp. so let's scratch the 8 comp days.
I know that you have offered to pay me 35 an hour that matches what you pay your friends, but that is only 4 dollars an hour more then what I make.
Please convert them into pa[id] days. Federal law requires you to pay me time and a half my regular pay.
Please don't send me any more emails of this type,
Your [sic] creating a very bad work environment.
You personal[ly] have asked me to change the work environment at MHT.
Please consider this a very solid start.
[Doc. 35-2 at 35; Doc. 35-3 at 58-59 pp. 57-58, 61 p. 60].9
On October 14, 2019, Krampe sent an email to Martin Vot ("Vot"), MHT's Technical Manager, with Howard copied thereon, titled "Manpower needs assembly for the rest of this month," stating, in pertinent part:
Hi [Vot], hope you are doing well!
Can you please coordinate [*6]  with [Howard] the manpower needs for the rem[a]inder of WCC and Pretium? Please keep me informed. The Pretium HR parts are in custom[s] in Frankfurt right now, hopefully they will ship soon. The WCC parts might ship today, I was surprised to hear that they have not urgently been forwarded as for the last time and project. I hope we still get these out today or latest tomorrow and then catch a very urgent flight to Atlanta.
Thank you and all the best[.]
[Doc. 35-2 at 39-40; Doc. 35-3 at 63 p. 62]. Howard responded that day, with Wagner, Vot, and several other individuals copied thereon, stating:
Hi [Krampe],
We had a discussion last week that it was [] Wagner's direction, that I would handle Project Management.
This was to allow you time to concentrate on Sales and CEO Responsibilities.
This email you sent breaks that directive. We discussed staying in our perspective [sic] lanes. I do project management you handle your responsibilities in sales. We are purposely keeping you out of email strings both internal and external emails that are out of your scope of work. This will reduce emails and increase productivity.
All items listed below are already known and have been taken care of.
[Doc. 35-2 [*7]  at 39; Doc. 35-3 at 63-64 pp. 62-63].10
Wagner replied all to Howard's email on the following day, October 15, 2019, stating:
Hi [Howard],
[N]o need to copy me on all th[ese] emails.
Regarding my directive, it is correct that I want you to be the main project engineer for all projects in the Americas. In this way [Krampe] will have more time to focus on sales and managing tasks.
But as [Krampe] is the CEO of MHT USA LLC. he has — of course — always the right to be informed about the status of the projects. He is responsible for the detailed definition of all processes inside the US subsidiary.
Please always consider [Krampe] as your direct manager.
[Doc. 35-2 at 38; Doc. 35-3 at 64-65 pp. 63-64].
In February and March 2020, Krampe initiated conversations with MHT Holding, MHT's parent corporation, regarding Howard's work quality and output. [Doc. 35-4 at 40-41 pp. 39-40]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 5]. In particular, Krampe became concerned after he observed Howard possibly sleeping at his desk instead of completing his job duties. [Doc. 35-4 at 41-42 pp. 40-41]. Additionally, by March 2020, Howard still had not completed the manual by the deadline which had been extended from September 30, 2019, [*8]  and consequently, Krampe again extended the deadline up to and including May 31, 2020. [Doc. 35-3 at 70 p. 69]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 5].11 However, Howard did not meet the May 31, 2020, deadline for completing the basic project process and procedure manual. [Doc. 35-3 at 74 p. 73]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 5-6].
On June 1, 2020, Krampe, who was frustrated with Howard's demeanor and failure to meet deadlines, sent an email titled, "Temporary separation/insubordination," to Zoe Williams ("Williams"), a Client Success Specialist with TriNet,12 as well as TriNet's team of Human Resources consultants, stating, in relevant part:
I have someone ([] Howard), who I gave a task to, to be finished by end of September last year, then I believe March and I gave him a final deadline by 31st of May. I will need to sit down with him this week for looking into that. What are my options, if he didn't do it, e.g. write a basic project step manual for our company. He is our project manager and we do need such a process description. Occasionally then on and off I mentioned topics, which should go into this manual, partly for reminding him that this is and will be ongoing.
Could I lay him off temporarily or could [*9]  I lower his salary? Are there other options? Ideally I don't lose him long term, though based on work output we would survive if he goes anywhere else.
[Doc. 35-2 at 42-43; Doc. 35-4 at 25-26 pp. 24-25]. Williams responded that day, stating:
I just wanted to let you know that I [] created [a] case [] to our Human Resource Center of Expertise [ ] Department, so they can provide their recommendations/guidance on how to proceed with this situation and provide you with documents you may find helpful.
You will be receiving a response from their email directly [] as soon as possible.
Thank you for your patience in the meantime. . . .
[Doc. 35-2 at 42; Doc. 35-4 at 29 p. 28]. At this time, Krampe was still considering whether he wanted to terminate Howard or continue to help improve his performance. [Doc. 35-4 at 28 p. 27].
On June 12, 2020, Howard began feeling ill and called out sick. [Doc. 35-3 at 74-75 pp. 73-74]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 6]. At this point, Krampe had not had a chance to sit down with Howard and discuss his job performance or failure to follow directives and complete assigned tasks. [Doc. 35-3 at 74-75 pp. 73-74]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 6]. On June 15, 2020, Howard had a telehealth [*10]  appointment regarding his symptoms and he took a Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") test at the recommendation of his doctor, and on the following day, he took a second COVID-19 test. [Doc. 35-3 at 75 p. 74]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 6]. Howard scheduled a follow-up appointment with his doctor for June 19, 2020, and he tested negative for COVID-19, but was still presenting with symptoms, and he therefore scheduled another follow-up appointment with his doctor for June 22, 2020. [Doc. 35-3 at 75 p. 74]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 6].13
On the morning of June 22, 2020, Howard emailed Krampe that he had "tested negative on the last [COVID-19] test," that he had "been on [a]ntibiotics since last Thursday for an upper [respiratory] infection," that he was "feeling at about 50%" that day, and that he would have a "follow up call" with his doctor before lunch, and he also asked whether he should come into the office or work from home. [Doc. 35-2 at 6, 46-47 (citation omitted); Doc. 35-3 at 76 p. 75]. Krampe responded to the email that he was "[g]lad to hear that [he was] feeling better"; that if he was "still not feeling well, please stay at home and get better until [he was] at 100% again"; that [*11]  upon his return, to "provide a note showing that [he] had no SARS COV[ID-19] infection, e.g. that [he] tested negative"; and that he would "have to file for vacation or PTO for the missed days." [Doc. 35-2 at 6, 46; Doc. 35-3 at 76 p. 75].
On the morning of June 23, 2020, Howard replied to Krampe's email, stating:
I attached the test report that showed I was seeking a medical Coronavirus evaluation.
I am using the Family First Coronavirus Response Act to cover ten days paid leave and up to 30 at partial pay as provided by this Federal Covid 2020 Act.
It's important to document the doctor handling my case is Dr. Noreen A. Mercando, the dates are[: ]

If my request for this federal coverage is denied please document reasons so the GDOL can review, if needed.
I am just trying to document the way the [COVID-19] website recommended, hopefully this will be done and over with and I can return to work.
[Doc. 35-2 at 6, 45-46; Doc. 35-3 at 77 p. 76].14
Howard returned to work at MHT on July 6, 2020, which was Krampe's first opportunity to speak with him about his job performance, including his ability to follow instructions and complete assigned tasks. [Doc. 35-3 at 78 p. 77]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 6].15 Upon Howard's return, Krampe asked him for a status update on the overdue project manual, at which time Howard expressed that he would not be completing that task. [Doc. 35-2 at 6; Doc. 35-3 at 79 p. 78].16 Because of Howard's perceived job performance deficiencies, including low work output and excessive cell phone usage, Krampe instructed Howard to move to another workstation so he could better monitor his work, but Howard refused and insisted that he remain at his current desk. [Doc. 35-3 at 79-80 pp. 78-79]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 6]. As a result of Howard's refusal to complete the [*13]  project manual and to move workstations, Krampe consulted with TriNet and Wagner about discharging Howard from his employment with MHT that same day. [Doc. 35-4 at 13 p. 12]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 7]. Krampe needed Wagner's permission prior to terminating Howard, and subsequently, Krampe received approval to terminate Howard, with a scheduled date of July 9, 2020. [Doc. 35-4 at 14 p. 13, 44 p. 43]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 7].
On July 8, 2020, Howard informed Krampe that he had a medical appointment scheduled for the morning of July 10, but later that day, he informed him that it had been moved to the morning of July 9. [Doc. 35-2 at 49, 51; Doc. 35-4 at 45 p. 44]. On July 9, 2020, Krampe terminated Howard's employment due to his performance issues and insubordination. [Doc. 35-2 at 7; Doc. 35-4 at 12 p. 11].17 During Howard's period of absence from June 12, 2020, through July 3, 2020, MHT paid him his regular compensation and Howard was not required to use any of his PTO. [Doc. 35-4 at 22-23 pp. 21-22].18 On July 10, 2020, Howard was diagnosed with MS for the first time. [Doc. 35-3 at 97-98 pp. 96-97].19
On November 4, 2021, Howard filed the instant action against MHT and [*14]  Krones, Inc. (Wisconsin) ("Krones"), alleging claims of disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation in violation of the ADA, as well as interference and retaliation in violation of the FMLA and the EPSLA, a component of the FFCRA. See [Doc. 1]. After the Court denied Howard's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint and granted a motion to dismiss filed by Krones and dismissed Krones from the action, see [Docs. 8, 12, 26, & 29], MHT filed a motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 35], which Howard opposes, [Doc. 36]. MHT has filed a reply in support of its motion, [Doc. 40], which is now ripe for ruling.20

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
"Summary judgment shall be granted if the movant shows that there is 'no genuine issue as to any material fact', such that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Jerome v. Barcelo Crestline, Inc., 507 F. App'x 861, 863 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)); see also Mathews v. Wells Fargo, 758 F. App'x 842, 843 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); Holmes v. Ga. ex rel. Strickland, 503 F. App'x 870, 872 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citations omitted); Young v. FedEx Express, 432 F. App'x 915, 916 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material facts, upon which the non-moving party [*15]  must then submit specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Hornsby-Culpepper v. Ware, 906 F.3d 1302, 1311 (11th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted); Premier Assocs. Inc. v. EXL Polymers, Inc., No. 1:08-cv-3490-WSD, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71982, 2010 WL 2838497, at *8 (N.D. Ga. July 19, 2010) (citations omitted), aff'd in part, 507 F. App'x 831 (11th Cir. 2013) (unpublished).
"[A] party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment may not rest upon mere allegation[s] or denials of his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Jackson v. B & L Disposal, Inc., 425 F. App'x 819, 820 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (first alteration in original) (citation and internal marks omitted); see also Shuler v. Ingram & Assocs., 441 F. App'x 712, 715 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); Bryant v. U.S. Steel Corp., 428 F. App'x 895, 897 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). "Although [the Court] view[s] all the evidence and draw[s] all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, [i]f the non-moving party fail[s] to make a showing on an essential element of his case with respect to which he ha[s] the burden of proof, then the entry of judgment as a matter of law is appropriate." Lowe v. Exel, Inc., 758 F. App'x 863, 865 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (unpublished) (fourth, fifth, and sixth alterations in original) (citations and internal marks omitted).
"Speculation or conjecture cannot create a genuine issue of material fact." Shuler, 441 F. App'x at 715 (citation omitted); see also Perry v. Pediatrix Med. Grp. of Ga., 841 F. App'x 174, 177 (11th Cir. 2021) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); Howard v. Or. Television, Inc., 276 F. App'x 940, 941 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (unpublished) [*16]  (citation omitted); Goodman v. Ga. Sw., 147 F. App'x 888, 891 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation and internal marks omitted) ("[A]ll reasonable inferences arising from the undisputed facts should be made in favor of the nonmovant, but an inference based on speculation and conjecture is not reasonable."). "Moreover, the non-moving party cannot create a genuine issue through evidence that is 'merely colorable' or 'not significantly probative.'" Morales v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., 446 F. App'x 179, 181 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); see also Breeding v. Integrated Behav. Health Inc., No. 22-10374, 2023 WL 3735341, at *2 (11th Cir. May 31, 2023) (per curiam) (citation omitted) (explaining that "conclusory allegations have no probative value at summary judgment unless supported by specific evidence"); Hall v. Dekalb Cnty. Gov't, 503 F. App'x 781, 786 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted) ("[M]ere conclusions, unsupported factual allegations, and statements that are based on belief, as opposed to personal knowledge, are insufficient to overcome a summary judgment motion."). Indeed, "[t]o overcome a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must present more than a scintilla of evidence supporting his position—rather, there must be enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party." Siddiqui v. NetJets Aviation, Inc., 773 F. App'x 562, 563 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation and internal marks omitted); see also James v. City of Montgomery, 823 F. App'x 728, 731 (11th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (unpublished) [*17]  (citation omitted); Wesley v. Austal USA, LLC, 776 F. App'x 638, 643 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); Mazzola v. Davis, 776 F. App'x 607, 609 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). In addition, "[t]here is no burden upon the district court to distill every potential argument that could be made based upon the materials before it on summary judgment," Anyanwu v. Brumos Motor Cars, Inc., 496 F. App'x 943, 945-46 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation and internal marks omitted), and "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, summary judgment for the moving party is proper," Premier Assocs., Inc., 2010 WL 2838497, at *9 (first alteration in original) (citation and internal marks omitted); see also Ellison v.

III. DISCUSSION
Howard alleges claims of disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation in violation [*18]  of the ADA and retaliation and interference in violation of the FMLA and the EPSLA provision of the FFCRA. [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 41-97]. MHT argues that Howard's ADA claims fail because it employed fewer than fifteen employees. [Doc. 35-10 at 1, 7-9]; see also [Doc. 40 at 2-6]. MHT also argues that Howard's ADA disability discrimination and retaliation claims fail as a matter of law because he cannot establish a prima facie case, and even if he could, it had legitimate, non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory reasons for terminating his employment, which Howard has failed to show were pretextual. [Doc. 35-10 at 9-20]; see also [Doc. 40 at 10-11]. In addition, MHT argues that Howard's FMLA claims fail because it employed fewer than fifty employees. [Doc. 35-10 at 1-2, 20]; see also [Doc. 40 at 5-10]. MHT further argues that Howard's FMLA interference claim fails because he cannot show that MHT denied him any benefits to which he was entitled and that his retaliation claim under the FMLA fails for the same reasons as his ADA retaliation claim. [Doc. 35-10 at 20-22]; see also [Doc. 40 at 10-11]. Finally, MHT contends that Howard's interference and retaliation claims asserted under the EPSLA provision [*19]  of the FFCRA fail because he cannot show that he suffered any damages, that his interference claim fails for the additional reason that he was not entitled to paid leave benefits under the FFCRA, and that his retaliation claim fails for the same reasons as his FMLA retaliation claim. [Doc. 35-10 at 22-23]; see also [Doc. 40 at 10-11]. Howard opposes MHT's motion, see [Doc. 36], and MHT has filed a reply in support of its motion, [Doc. 40]. The Court will now address the parties' arguments in turn.

A. Howard's ADA Disability Discrimination & Retaliation Claims
"Title I of the ADA specifically addresses discrimination in the employment context," Marsh v. Ga. Dep't of Behav. & Health Developmental Disabilities, No. CV410-273, 2011 WL 806423, at *2 n.9 (S.D. Ga. Feb. 14, 2011) (citation and internal marks omitted), adopted by 2011 WL 806658, at *1 (S.D. Ga. Mar. 2, 2011), and provides:
No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.
42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Andrews v. City of Hartford, 700 F. App'x 924, 926 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (unpublished) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)); Leme v. S. Baptist Hosp. of Fla., Inc., 248 F. Supp. 3d 1319, 1337 (M.D. Fla. 2017) (quoting Jordan v. City of Union City, 646 F. App'x 736, 739 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam) (unpublished)).21 The ADA also prohibits "an employer from discriminating against any individual for participation in or opposition [*20]  to practices made unlawful by . . . the ADA." Robinson v. RockTenn CP, LLC, 986 F. Supp. 2d 1287, 1310 (N.D. Ala. 2013).
Howard may support his claims of disability discrimination and retaliation by offering either direct or circumstantial evidence. Wascura v. City of S. Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted); Hall v. Dougherty Cnty. Sch. Sys., CASE NO.: 1:15-CV-189 (LJA), 2017 WL 3584908, at *5 (M.D. Ga. Aug. 17, 2017) (citations omitted); see also Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted), abrogated on other grounds as recognized in Hester v. Univ. of Ala. Birmingham Hosp., 798 F. App'x 453, 456-57 (11th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (unpublished); Obester v. Lucas Assocs. Inc., Civil Action File No. 1:08-CV-03491-MHS-AJB, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144161, 2010 WL 8292401, at *25 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 2, 2010) (citation omitted), adopted by 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144162, 2010 WL 8304884, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 7, 2010). "Direct evidence is 'evidence that, if believed, proves the existence of a fact without inference or presumption.'" Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1086 (alterations omitted) (quoting Burrell v. Bd. of Trs. of Ga. Military Coll., 125 F.3d 1390, 1393 (11th Cir. 1997)). "Where direct evidence is present, summary judgment is not appropriate." Bryant v. Jones, 696 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1324 (N.D. Ga. 2010) (footnote and citation omitted).
Where, as here, there is no direct evidence of discrimination or retaliation, "'[t]he familiar burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination actions is equally applicable to ADA claims.'" Holton v. First Coast Serv. Options, Inc., 703 F. App'x 917, 920 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (unpublished) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). Thus, "courts apply the framework articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), and its progeny." Solloway v. White, CIVIL ACTION FILE NO. 1:13-CV-03827-TWT-WEJ, 2017 WL 1170895, at *29 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 15, 2017) (citation omitted), adopted by 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43796, 2017 WL 1134460, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 27, 2017), aff'd, 738 F. App'x 985 (11th Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (unpublished).
"Under the McDonnell Douglas[] framework, [Howard] must first show an inference of discriminatory [or retaliatory] intent by establishing a prima facie case." Paye v. Sec'y of Defense, 157 F. App'x 234, 236 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (unpublished) [*21]  (citing McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802); see also Iaciofano v. Sch. Bd. of Broward Cnty., Case No. 16-cv-60963-BLOOM/Valle, 2017 WL 564368, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 13, 2017) (quoting Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1331 (11th Cir. 1998)). "After [Howard] has established a prima facie case of discrimination [and retaliation], the burden of production is placed upon [ MHT] to articulate a legitimate non[-]discriminatory [and non-retaliatory] reason for [the] employment action." Zeigler v. Ala. Dep't of Human Res., 710 F. Supp. 2d 1229, 1240 (M.D. Ala. 2010) (citing Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)).22 If MHT meets its burden of production, the inference of discrimination and retaliation is erased, and the burden shifts back to Howard to show that MHT's articulated reason is merely a pretext for discrimination and retaliation. Entrekin v. City of Panama City Fla., 376 F. App'x 987, 997 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). "Nevertheless, the crux of the analysis at summary judgment is simply whether the plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue of discrimination [and retaliation]." Evans, 2023 WL 3198240, at *3 (citation and internal marks omitted). Despite this burden-shifting framework, the "ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that [ MHT] intentionally discriminated [and retaliated] against [Howard] remains at all times with [Howard]." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253 (citations omitted).

1. MHT's Employer Status
MHT contends that it "is not a covered employer under the ADA" because "[a]t all time relevant to this action, [it] employed fewer than fifteen [*22]  employees." [Doc. 35-10 at 7-8 (citation omitted)]. MHT also contends that while Howard "may argue that MHT's parent company's employees should be part of the employee census," it is "based in Germany and its foreign citizens employed outside the United States are excluded from the employee numerosity requirements under the ADA." [Id. at 8 (citations omitted)]; see also [Doc. 40 at 3-5]. Howard responds that "federal courts have consistently found that foreign employees are counted in an integrated enterprise for purposes of federal discrimination statutes" and that "[i]n this case, MHT and MHT Technology are an integrated enterprise with 135 employees, above the threshold for coverage under the ADA." [Doc. 36 at 7].23 MHT replies that "foreign citizens employed exclusively outside the United States cannot be included in the fifteen-employee head count under the ADA" and that there is no evidence of an integrated enterprise between MHT and MHT Technology, and in fact, Howard cannot show such an enterprise, which normally is between a parent corporation and a subsidiary, because "MHT is not a subsidiary of MHT Technology or vice versa," but "MHT Holding [] owns both MHT and MHT Technology," [*23]  and "[a]s such, the integrated enterprise theory cannot apply here." [Doc. 40 at 3, 6-10 (citations omitted)].
The ADA provides that an "'employee' means an individual employed by an employer" and "[w]ith respect to employment in a foreign country, such term includes an individual who is a citizen of the United States." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(4). Additionally, under the section prohibiting disability discrimination in employment, the ADA provides that "[t]his section shall not apply with respect to the foreign operations of an employer that is a foreign person not controlled by an American employer." Id. § 12112(c)(2)(B).24 Because it is undisputed that MHT only employed three full-time employees, including Howard, and one part-time employee, see [Doc. 35-4 at 11-12 pp. 10-11]; see also [Doc. 35-3 at 47 p. 46], "[t]he Court first must determine whether foreign citizens based abroad who worked exclusively outside of the United States are included in [the ADA's] fifteen-employee jurisdictional count," Mousa v. Lauda Air Luftfahrt, A.G., 258 F. Supp. 2d 1329, 1335 (S.D. Fla. 2003).
"In interpreting the ADA, courts frequently turn to cases interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [('Title VII')], which prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, because [claims] of [*24]  employment discrimination arising under the ADA are subject to the same remedies and procedures as those under Title VII." Trask v. Swish Kenco, Ltd., No. 1:12-cv-00050-DBH, 2013 WL 360056, at *8 (D. Me. Jan. 4, 2013) (citations and internal marks omitted), adopted by 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12263, 2013 WL 361085, at *1 (D. Me. Jan. 30, 2013). Courts have held that "non-U.S. citizens employed outside of the United States are not deemed 'employees' as that term is defined under Title VII" and, "[i]n fact, they are explicitly excluded under the Act." Greenbaum, 979 F. Supp. at 983 (citation omitted); see also Mousa, 258 F. Supp. 2d at 1335 (explaining that "even though Title VII does not explicitly state that employees of foreign corporations must work in the United States to be included in the jurisdictional count, the 1991 Act and the statutory language of Title VII strongly support this proposition."). Indeed, "the majority of courts that have addressed the issue have found that foreign citizens employed abroad who work exclusively outside of the United States do not count towards the fifteen-employee jurisdictional minimum." Mousa, 258 F. Supp. 2d at 1335 (citations omitted). Thus, Howard's attempt to expand MHT's employee count by adding foreign employees who work exclusively outside the United States fails. See Denty v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 109 F.3d 147, 150-51 (3d Cir. 1997) (citation omitted) (explaining that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), which contains nearly identical definitions and provisions as the ADA, "does not [*25]  apply to foreign nationals working for [] corporations in a foreign workplace and it does not apply to foreign companies which are not controlled by U.S. firms" and finding simply that "the ADEA does not apply when a foreign corporation controls an American corporation"); Davenport v. Hansaworld USA, Inc., 23 F. Supp. 3d 679, 692 (S.D. Miss. 2014) (citation omitted) (finding "foreign citizens employed outside the United States are excluded from the employee head count" and "[o]nly those foreign citizens working inside the United States . . . should be factored into the fifteen—employee threshold"); Trask, 2013 WL 360056, at *9 (finding partial summary judgment was warranted in favor of the American company, since there was no evidence that it controlled the Canadian company, but the "facts all essentially assert[ed] that [the Canadian company was] the controlling entity" and that there was therefore "no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether [the Canadian company's] employees should be aggregated with those of [the American company]" and that the American company's employees were "the only employees to be counted in determining the size of the company"); Russell v. Midwest-Werner & Pfleiderer, Inc., 955 F. Supp. 114, 115 (D. Kan. 1997) (alteration in original) (citations and internal marks omitted) ("[F]oreign employees of a foreign corporation are not [*26]  considered employees for purposes of counting the total number of the defendant's employees," but rather, the employees would only be counted if they are "American citizens employed abroad by American companies or their foreign subsidiaries.").25
Howard maintains that even though MHT Technology is a German corporation that employs only foreign citizens in a foreign country with no offices located in the United States, "MHT and MHT Technology are an integrated enterprise with 135 employees, above the threshold for coverage under the ADA." [Doc. 36 at 7]. Howard's "argument rests on the 'integrated enterprise' theory, under which [MHT and MHT Technology] would be considered a single employer under the [ADA]," meaning, "[i]f the corporate relationships between the [two] are such that they may be deemed a single employer or a single corporate entity, then [Howard] would be allowed to aggregate the number of employees employed by the [two ] corporations and, in so doing, meet [the ADA's] threshold." Keenan v. Matchmaker Int'l, Inc. of Mobile, No. Civ.A. 98-0515-CB-C, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 795, 1999 WL 33590522, at *4 (S.D. Ala. Jan. 20, 1999) (footnote omitted). MHT responds that Howard "presents no record evidence [] to support his contention that MHT and MHT Technology constitute an integrated enterprise," [Doc. 40 at 6], and [*27]  the Court agrees.
"The Eleventh Circuit has identified three circumstances in which it is appropriate to aggregate multiple entities as employers," and "under the 'single employer' or 'integrated enterprise' test, two employers may be counted together if they are 'highly integrated with respect to ownership and operations.'" Thomas v. Rockdale Cnty., Civil Action No. 1:19-CV-2430-MLB-JSA, 2020 WL 10227322, at *7 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 23, 2020) (quoting Lyes v. City of Riviera Beach, 166 F.3d 1332, 1341 (11th Cir. 1999)), adopted by 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 256638, 2020 WL 10227471, at *5 (N.D. Ga. July 15, 2020). "[W]hile aggregation under the single-employer theory is commonly alleged in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship, it is not necessary for the parent-subsidiary relationship to exist for this theory to apply." Player v. Nations Biologics, Inc., 993 F. Supp. 878, 881 (M.D. Ala. 1997) (citations omitted).
"To determine whether two businesses constitute a 'single employer' (otherwise called an 'integrated enterprise') . . ., courts consider the following four factors: (1) the degree of interrelatedness of operations between the two entities; (2) the degree of centralized control of labor relations; (3) presence of common management; and (4) common ownership or financial control." McCulley v. Allstates Tech. Servs., No. Civ.A. 04-0115-WS-B, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41550, 2005 WL 1475314, at *25 (S.D. Ala. June 21, 2005) (footnote and citation omitted) (citing McKenzie v. Davenport-Harris Funeral Home, 834 F.2d 930, 933 (11th Cir. 1987)); see also Boles v. Spanish Oaks Hospice, Inc., CV416-323, 2017 WL 2222443, at *1 (S.D. Ga. May 19, 2017) (second and seventh alterations in original) (citation and internal marks omitted) ("[S]everal entities [*28]  are 'integrated,' such that they count as a single FMLA 'employer' where [the allegedly integrated entities] have (i) [c]ommon management; (ii) [i]nterrelation between operations; (iii) [c]entralized control of labor relations; and (iv) [a] [d]egree of common ownership/financial control."). "While all four factors are weighed in the 'single employer' calculus, primacy is afforded to that of centralized control of labor relations." McCulley, 2005 WL 1475314, at *25 (citations omitted); see also Harriel v. Dialtone, Inc., 179 F. Supp. 2d 1309, 1312 (M.D. Ala. 2001) (citation and internal marks omitted) (explaining that centralized control of labor operations was "usually accorded greater weight than the other[ factors] insofar as the relevant issue in Title VII concern employment decisions"). "The basic question that courts should ask in deciding whether an entity is an employer is: who (or which entity) is in control of the fundamental aspects of the employment relationship that gave rise to the claim." Manigault-Speaks v. Azar, CIVIL ACTION FILE NO. 1:20-cv-04220-WMR-LTW, 2021 WL 4820701, at *3 (N.D. Ga. May 12, 2021) (citation and internal marks omitted), adopted by 2021 U.S. Dist.

Mini-Circuits, Lab, Inc., 163 F.3d 1236, 1244-45 (11th Cir. 1998) (citations and internal marks omitted) (explaining that under either the "single employer" or the "joint employer" theories, both "concentrate on the degree of control an entity has over the adverse employment decision on [*29]  which the . . . suit is based"); Schweitzer v. Advanced Telemarketing Corp., 104 F.3d 761, 764 (5th Cir. 1997) (citations omitted) (explaining that courts often refine "their [single employer] analysis to the single question, 'What entity made the final decisions regarding employment matters related to the person claiming discrimination?'"); Walker v. Banks Finley, White & Co. of Ga., P.C., CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:19-cv-05461-CAP-RDC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 256473, 2020 WL 10181661, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 20, 2020) (citation omitted) (explaining that the "four factors [had] been distilled into the question of what entity made the final employment decisions over the plaintiff").
Howard asserts that in considering the four factors utilized to determine whether two entities are an integrated enterprise, the "record weighs in favor of finding MHT and MHT Technology to be an integrated enterprise." [Doc. 36 at 7]. In particular, Howard contends that because MHT Holding owns both MHT and MHT Technology and MHT receives a sales commission paid by MHT Holding, he has shown an interrelation of operations. [Id. at 7-8 (citations omitted)]. He further contends that "common management[] is clearly established with the common ownership and management of MHT and MHT Technology through [] Wagner," since Wagner "operates as the CEO of MHT Holding, which owns both MHT and MHT Technology, and also operates as the Chairman of the Board of Directors [*30]  for MHT"; that Wagner's "management over MHT and MHT Technology demonstrates centralized control of labor relations as Wagner had the authority to fire MHT employees"; and that Wagner's "role as both CEO of MHT Holding, which owns both MHT and MHT Technology, and also as the Chairman of the Board of Directors for MHT, clearly demonstrates that MHT and MHT Technology were an integrated enterprise by virtue of its common ownership through [] Wagner and MHT Holding." [Id. at 8 (citations omitted)]. Howard therefore maintains that "[a]s an integrated enterprise, MHT and MHT Technology's combined 135 employees as well as the four employees under MHT clearly establishes MHT as a covered employer under the ADA." [Id. at 10].
As MHT points out, however, "MHT is not a subsidiary of MHT Technology or vice versa," but "MHT Holding [] owns both MHT and MHT Technology," which "operated as separate and distinct entities at all relevant times." [Doc. 40 at 7-8 (citing [Doc. 35-4 at 39 p. 38])]. MHT further points out that Howard "presented no evidence to suggest that MHT and MHT Technology shared combined offices, lines of credit, bank accounts, payroll preparation, or telephone numbers," in order [*31]  to establish an interrelation of operations, but that "MHT Technology [only] supplies MHT with molds, which MHT then re-sells in the United States," and "MHT's parent company, [MHT Holding,] pays MHT the [sales] commission"; that Howard "neglects to provide any evidence of centralized control over labor relations between MHT and MHT Technology," but that MHT "had its own human resources department and did not share employees with other entities"; and that Howard "also identified no evidence to show MHT and MHT Technology share any corporate officers," but in fact, Wagner, who was the Chairman of the Board of Directors for MHT and the CEO of MHT Holding, did "not serve on the Board for MHT Technology." [Id. at 7-9 (citation omitted) (citing [Doc. 35-4 at 19 p. 18, 38-39 pp. 37-38])]. MHT therefore contends that Howard "cannot satisfy the four-part test of the integrated enterprise theory" and has failed "to establish that an integrated enterprise exists between MHT and MHT Technology." [Id. at 9-10].
While Howard points to Wagner's role as CEO of MHT Holding, which owns both MHT and MHT Technology, as well as his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors of MHT, to establish the four-part [*32]  test for finding an integrated enterprise between MHT and MHT Technology, see [Doc. 36 at 7-8], his attempt "to tie together separately incorporated companies" that are "wholly owned by a single individual" fails because "[c]ommon ownership, absent some element of economic or other integration among the subsidiaries, will not be sufficient to warrant disregarding the corporate form," Keenan, 1999 WL 33590522, at *5 (citations omitted). Moreover, the evidence "does not establish that the [two] subsidiaries were interrelated with one another," but "[r]ather, th[e] evidence would speak to whether [MHT Holding], as the parent company, should be considered a single integrated enterprise with each of its individual subsidiaries," Vance, 279 F.3d at 302, but as previously noted, that issue is not before this Court. Indeed, Howard has not presented any evidence that MHT and MHT Technology, which simply supplied MHT with molds for MHT to resell in the United States, shared an interrelation of operations, which generally includes combined accounting records, bank accounts, lines of credit, payroll preparation, switchboards, telephone numbers, or offices. See Gortney v. Joseph & Co., CASE NO.: CV-05-RRA-1867-M, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111973, 2007 WL 9711464, at *11 (N.D. Ala. July 6, 2007) (citation omitted). Nor has he shown that the two subsidiaries had a centralized control [*33]  of labor relations or common management. That is, while MHT and MHT Technology are subsidiaries of MHT Holding, "there is no evidence that [MHT Holding] promulgates uniform policies and practices for either of the other two companies"; that they "share common resources such as information management, risk management, payroll, benefits, and insurance services"; that anyone from MHT Technology directed labor operations at MHT; or that they share common management, aside from common ownership by MHT Holding, since the record shows that Krampe was the CEO of MHT and while Wagner served at the CEO of MHT Holding and as Chairman of the Board of Directors of MHT, he did not serve on the Board of Directors for MHT Technology, and there is no evidence that anyone from MHT Technology controlled the day-to-day operations of MHT or had the ability to make employment decisions with regard to MHT's employees. Id., at *12-16; see also Cruz-Lovo v. Ryder Sys., Inc., 298 F. Supp. 2d 1248, 1253 (S.D. Fla. 2003), aff'd, 88 F. App'x 381 (11th Cir. 2003) (unpublished), for text, see No. 03-11247, 88 Fed. Appx. 381, 2003 WL 23150113 (11th Cir. Nov. 5, 2003) (per curiam). Thus, "the Court concludes that [MHT and MHT Technology] do[] not qualify as an integrated enterprise, and therefore, aggregating them for purposes of qualifying as an 'employer' under [the ADA] is inappropriate." Gilliland v. Sanico Clanton, LLC, CASE NO. 2:18-CV-952-SMD, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190559, 2019 WL 5700733, at *5 (M.D. Ala. Nov. 4, 2019). Accordingly, [*34]  Howard's ADA claims fail because he has not established the statutory minimum employee threshold. Nevertheless, even if Howard could meet the minimum employee threshold required for MHT to be subject to the ADA's provisions, his ADA claims would still fail on the merits for the reasons that follow.

2. Howard's ADA Discrimination Claim

a. Prima Facie Case
"To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, [Howard] must show that (1) he is disabled; (2) he was a qualified individual . . .; and (3) he was discriminated against because of his disability."26 Puckett v. Bd. of Trs. of First Baptist Church of Gainesville, Inc., 17 F. Supp. 3d 1339, 1342 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (internal marks omitted) (quoting Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). "In short, [Howard] must show that []he is an 'individual with a disability' against whom [MHT] discriminated." Scott v. Shoe Show, Inc., 38 F. Supp. 3d 1343, 1360 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)), adopted at 1348.
In its motion for summary judgment, MHT challenges Howard's ability to establish any of the elements of a prima facie case. See [Doc. 35-10 at 9-15]. Specifically, MHT maintains that Howard cannot show he was disabled because "no evidence shows [his] conditions during his employment substantially limited any major life activity," nor can he show that he was a qualified individual because he was [*35]  "not an individual with a disability[.]" [Id. at 9-12 (emphasis and internal marks omitted)]. Finally, MHT maintains that Howard "cannot prove that MHT terminated his employment because of his disability," but "[r]ather, MHT did not know of any disability or disabling medical condition suffered by [Howard] before his discharge," since he "only received his [MS] diagnosis after his termination from MHT, on July 10, 2020," and his "symptoms consistent with COVID-19" do not qualify as "a disability under the ADA." [Id. at 10-11, 13-14 (emphasis and citations omitted)]. Howard, who did not specifically respond to MHT's arguments regarding whether he was disabled or a qualified individual as defined by the ADA but merely presumes that he has met those elements of a prima facie case, see [Doc. 36 at 15-16],27 asserts that the "[r]ecord evidence demonstrates [that] MHT discriminated against [him] based on his disability" because "[s]hortly after [he] return[ed] to work on July 6, 2020, Krampe was informed . . . that he had doctor's appointments beginning on July 9th"; that "Krampe observed Howard was walking with a limp"; that Howard was "first informed on July 10, 2020 of his [MS] diagnosis," [*36]  but that the diagnosis was dated back to June 16, 2020; and that on July 9, 2020, "Krampe terminated Howard's employment under pretext of a history of insubordination and poor performance." [Doc. 36 at 14-16 (emphasis and citations omitted)].28
In his complaint, Howard alleges that MHT discriminated against him by terminating his employment based on his "actual disability, . . . record of being disabled, and/or [] perceived . . . disab[ility.]" [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 57, 59]. Howard, however, "has not presented sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that he was disabled as defined by the [ADA]." Stepanovich v. Ken Corbett Farms, LLC, Civil Action No. 7:18-CV-186 (HL), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 237194, 2020 WL 7409602, at *3 (M.D. Ga. Dec. 17, 2020).
"Congress made significant changes to the ADA by enacting the ADA Amendments Act of 2008," and "[t]hese amendments convey that an extensive analysis is not required to determine whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA." EEOC v. St. Joseph's Hosp., Inc., 842 F.3d 1333, 1343 (11th Cir. 2016) (citations omitted). "There are three ways an ADA . . . plaintiff can demonstrate [his] disability." Hargett v. Fla. Atl. Univ. Bd. of Trs., 219 F. Supp. 3d 1227, 1236 (S.D. Fla. 2016). "A 'disability' includes: '(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of [Howard's] major life activities . . .;29 (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.'" [*37]  Jackson v. City of Homewood, Civil Action Number 2:13-cv-00737-AKK, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111356, 2015 WL 5011230, at *5 (N.D. Ala. Aug. 24, 2015) (second alteration in original) (citations omitted); see also 42 U.S.C § 12102(1). In the present case, Howard "has not produced evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact whether [his alleged] impairment impeded any major life activity; that he had a record of impairment; or that [MHT] regarded him as disabled." Stepanovich, 2020 WL 7409602, at *4.
"Generally, to sufficiently allege that an impairment interferes with a major life activity, a plaintiff must elaborate on whether the alleged impairment interfered with his alleged major life activity during the period of alleged discrimination by [d]efendant[]." Earl v. Good Samaritan Hosp. of Suffern NY, 625 F. Supp. 3d 292, 304 (S.D.N.Y. 2022) (citation and internal marks omitted). "Although [Howard was ] diagnosed with [MS the day after his termination], [MS] has not substantially limited any of [his] major life activities," as he has failed to provide any evidence "that []he [was] unable to care for [himself], walk, speak or work due to [his] MS." Edwards v. AT&T, CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:05-CV-2319-ODE, 2007 WL 9701276, at *6 (N.D. Ga. May 30, 2007); see also Wynn v. Whitney Holding Corp., 220 F. Supp. 2d 582, 589 (M.D. La. 2002) (explaining that MS "does not automatically qualify as a disability under the ADA"). Rather, the only evidence in the record, as MHT points out, is that Howard "missed work from June 12, 2020, through July 3, 2020 because he had symptoms consistent with COVID-19," and in fact, he even asked [*38]  whether he should come into the office or work from home on June 22, 2020, since he was still presenting with COVID-19 symptoms despite a negative test, and Howard also testified that he was unaware he had MS during this time and did not know the cause of his symptoms prior to his termination, but was informed that it was COVID-19. [Doc. 35-10 at 10 (citations omitted)]; see also [Doc. 35-2 at 6, 45-47; Doc. 35-3 at 42-44 pp. 41-43, 75-76 pp. 74-75, 78 p. 77, 97-99 pp. 96-98].30 While "certain forms of COVID-19 may be considered a disability under the ADA," such as "longer forms of COVID-19," where it "can 'substantially limit major life activity,'" such as "one's respiratory function, gastrointestinal function, and brain function, for periods lasting months after first being infected," Matias v. Terrapin House, Inc., No. 5:21-cv-02288, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176094, 2021 WL 4206759, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 16, 2021) (citation omitted), under the circumstances of this case, Howard has not shown that his COVID-19 symptoms qualify as a disability under the ADA, see Roman v. Hertz Loc. Edition Corp., Case No.: 20cv2462-BEN (AGS), 2022 WL 1541865, at *8 (S.D. Cal. May 16, 2022) (citation omitted) (explaining that the "EEOC's non-binding guidance and technical assistance manuals in interpreting the ADA [] suggest that run of the mill COVID-19 infections do not qualify as ADA disabilities"). That is, in order to establish that he [*39]  had an actual disability, Howard must, at a minimum, show "how his specific COVID symptoms impacted specific major life activities," and "[a]llegations regarding a need to isolate or quarantine, without more, do not support an inference of disability." Worrall v. River Shack LLC, CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:22-CV-0392-B, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146077, 2022 WL 3371345, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 15, 2022) (citations omitted); see also McCone v. Exela Techs., Inc., Case No. 6:21-cv-912-CEM-DCI, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45734, 2022 WL 801772, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 14, 2022) (holding that "being infected with COVID-19, standing alone, does not meet the ADA's definitions of disability or impairment").31 Because Howard has failed to produce any evidence that he "suffer[ed] a substantial limitation in a major life activity at the time he experience[d] [the] [alleged] adverse employment decision, then he [was] not disabled at the pertinent time when [ MHT] authorized [the alleged adverse] action. . . ." Earl, 625 F. Supp. 3d at 304-05 (alterations in original) (citation and internal marks omitted). Thus, Howard "has failed to produce sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact that he is 'actually disabled' as defined by the ADA," and, for the reasons that follow, he "also has not shown a record of impairment." Stepanovich, 2020 WL 7409602, at *4.
"Federal regulations provide that '[a]n individual has a record of a disability if the individual has a history of . . . a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits [*40]  one or more major life activities.'" Id. (second alteration in original) (citation and internal marks omitted). Howard "need only show that he has a history of an impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities when compared to most people in the general population." Id. (citation and internal marks omitted). Prior to experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, Howard "had no history of any issues," id., at *5 (citation omitted), and he specifically testified that he did not have any other health issues while employed at MHT prior to the onset of his COVID-19 symptoms, as well as his subsequent diagnosis of MS, about which he never informed Krampe, [Doc. 35-3 at 44 p. 43, 99 p. 98; Doc. 35-4 at 46 p. 45]. Consequently, he "has not demonstrated a record of a physical impairment to satisfy the first prong of his prima facie case," Stepanovich, 2020 WL 7409602, at *5,32 and the only remaining way in which he may establish that he had a disability under the ADA is by showing that MHT regarded him as disabled.
Pursuant to the ADA, "an individual may establish that his employer regarded him as disabled if he shows that he has been subjected to an action prohibited under [the Act] because of an actual or perceived physical [*41]  or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." Id. (citation and internal marks omitted). However, "[a]n employer does not fire or otherwise discriminate against an employee because of a perceived physical impairment unless the employer actually perceives that the employee has the impairment." Id. (citation and internal marks omitted). That is, "[i]mportantly, what matters for the regarded as theory is whether [ MHT] perceived [Howard] as impaired, not whether he was actually impaired." Midkiff, 2022 WL 1231707, at *15 (citation and internal marks omitted). And, "[t]he employee must establish that he was regarded as having a disability at the time of the adverse employment action about which he is complaining." Id. (citation and internal marks omitted).
The evidence shows that while Howard was informed that, based on his symptoms, he had COVID-19, and he was instructed to quarantine from June 22 through July 3, 2020, he never tested positive for COVID-19, he informed Krampe of the negative test results, and he immediately returned to work once the quarantine period ended. [Doc. 35-2 at 45-46; Doc. 35-3 at 75-78 pp. 74-77]. Indeed, Howard testified that by [*42]  the time he returned to work on July 6, 2020, Krampe was only aware that he felt sick and was pursuing a diagnosis. [Doc. 35-3 at 84 p. 83]. It is also undisputed that Howard was first informed of his MS diagnosis the day after he was terminated from his employment with MHT and that he never told Krampe about this diagnosis. [Id. at 44 p. 43, 97-99 pp. 96-98; Doc. 35-4 at 46 p. 45]. Although Howard relies on the fact that he informed Krampe that he had scheduled a doctor's appointment upon his return to work and that Krampe observed him walking with a limp on July 9, 2020, the day of his discharge, see [Doc. 36 at 15], "the record contains no evidence that [Krampe or anyone else at MHT] perceived [Howard] to be impaired or incapable of performing his job" due to a disability and "there is no evidence from which a jury could conclude that [MHT] was concerned about the potential consequences of [Howard's alleged physical impairment] and that [Krampe] terminated [Howard] for that reason." Stepanovich, 2020 WL 7409602, at *5; see also Baum v. Metro Restoration Servs., Inc., 240 F. Supp. 3d 684, 693 (W.D. Ky. 2017) (citations and internal marks omitted) (explaining that it was "not enough that the employer is simply aware of a plaintiff's symptoms; rather the plaintiff must show that the employer regarded [*43]  the individual as impaired within the meaning of the ADA" and finding that plaintiff's evidence "showing only that [defendant] was aware of his symptoms," that defendant "had knowledge that [plaintiff] missed work on some occasions because of an unspecified heart procedure, various visits to the doctor's office, and the performance of a CAT scan on an unspecified location of his body," and that plaintiff and defendant "exchanged text messages about [plaintiff's] heart and trip to the emergency room" did not "show that [defendant] regarded [plaintiff] as impaired"). Accordingly, "[h]aving failed to meet the first element of his prima facie case, [Howard's] claim of disability discrimination must fail," and MHT is entitled to summary judgment on this claim for this additional reason. Stepanovich, 2020 WL 7409602, at *5.33

b. Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reasons & Pretext
MHT also contends that, even assuming Howard could establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, it is still entitled to summary judgment because it "discharged [Howard] for legitimate business reasons and [Howard] has no evidence to the contrary." [Doc. 35-10 at 2, 15; Doc. 40 at 10-11]. Specifically, MHT [*44]  asserts that it terminated Howard's employment on July 9, 2020, after Krampe determined it was warranted based on "his history of performance shortcomings and insubordinate conduct." [Doc. 35-10 at 15 (citation omitted)]; see also [Doc. 40 at 11]. In particular, MHT explains that Krampe first inquired about his disciplinary options should Howard fail to meet the twice-extended deadline to complete an assignment on June 1, 2020, as he was considering whether he wanted to terminate Howard or provide him additional time to improve, but Howard called out sick on June 12, 2020, at which time Krampe had not yet had a chance to speak with Howard to discuss his job performance. [Doc. 35-2 at 6, 42-43; Doc. 35-3 at 74-75 pp. 73-74; Doc. 35-4 at 25-26 pp. 24-25, 28-29 pp. 27-28]. From June 15, 2020, through June 22, 2020, Howard twice tested for COVID-19 due to his symptoms, but was negative each time, and on June 22, 2020, he inquired from Krampe as to whether he should come into the office or work from home since he still had COVID-19 symptoms even though he had tested negative, and on June 23, 2020, Howard informed Krampe that his doctor recommended that he quarantine through July 3, 2020, [*45]  based on his symptoms. [Doc. 35-2 at 6, 45-47; Doc. 35-3 at 75-77 pp. 74-76].
Following his quarantine, Howard returned to work on July 6, 2020, which was Krampe's first opportunity to speak with him about his job performance, and upon finding out that Howard had not completed the assigned project that had twice been extended and Howard's response that he would not be completing the task, as well as the fact that Krampe had requested Howard change workstations, but he refused, Krampe consulted with Human Resources and Wagner that day about terminating Howard's employment, and he received approval to terminate Howard, with a scheduled date of July 9, 2020. [Doc. 35-2 at 6-7; Doc. 35-3 at 78-80 pp. 77-79; Doc. 35-4 at 13-14 pp. 12-13, 44 p. 43]. In the meantime, on July 8, 2020, Howard informed Krampe that he had a medical appointment scheduled for July 10, but later that day, he informed him that it had been moved to the morning of July 9, 2020. [Doc. 35-2 at 49, 51; Doc. 35-4 at 45 p. 44]. On July 9, 2020, Krampe terminated Howard's employment as planned due to his performance issues and insubordination, and the following day, Howard was officially diagnosed with MS, with the diagnosis [*46]  backdated to June 16 or June 17, 2020, since that was when Howard first presented with symptoms, though Howard admitted that he did not suspect that he had MS prior to being informed of the diagnosis on July 10, 2020. [Doc. 35-2 at 7; Doc. 35-3 at 42-43 pp. 41-42; 97-98 pp. 96-97; Doc. 35-4 at 12 p. 11]. Because MHT's proffered reasons of "performance shortcomings and insubordinate conduct," [Doc. 35-10 at 15 (citation omitted)], constitute legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the alleged employment decision at issue, see Hawkins v. Ceco Corp., 883 F.2d 977, 985 (11th Cir. 1989) (finding insubordination and failure to perform the work assigned were justifiable grounds for termination offered by defendant); Key v. Cent. Ga. Kidney Specialists, P.C., CIVIL ACTION NO. 5:19-CV-00253-TES, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 200490, 2020 WL 7053293, at *10 (M.D. Ga. Oct. 28, 2020) (citation omitted) (noting that defendant "made a nondiscriminatory decision to no longer tolerate [plaintiff's] poor performance as an employee"), aff'd, No. 20-14351, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 33949, 2021 WL 5321892 (11th Cir. 2021) (per curiam); EEOC v. Atlanta Gastroenterology Assocs., LLC, No. Civ.A.1:05CV2504-TWT, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11312, 2007 WL 602212, at *20 n.29 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2007) (citations omitted) (explaining that the "Eleventh Circuit ha[d] made it clear that insubordination, a poor attitude, disruptive conduct, or any combination thereof, [were] legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating employment"), the onus is on Howard to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reasons provided by MHT are pretext for prohibited, [*47]  discriminatory conduct, see Edmond v. Univ. of Miami, 441 F. App'x 721, 724-25 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished); Tiggs-Vaughn v. Tuscaloosa Hous. Auth., 385 F. App'x 919, 923 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (unpublished).
To demonstrate pretext, Howard's evidence must reveal "'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies or contradictions in [ MHT's] proffered legitimate reasons for its actions that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.'" Maples v. UHS of Ga., Inc., 716 F. Supp. 2d 1266, 1274 (N.D. Ga. 2010) (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997)). Howard may prove pretext by "either proving that intentional discrimination motivated [MHT] or producing sufficient evidence to allow a rational trier of fact to disbelieve the legitimate reason[s] proffered by [ MHT], which permits, but does not compel, the trier of fact to find illegal discrimination." Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1088 (citations omitted); see also Shuford v. City of Montgomery, Civil Action No. 2:10cv203-WHA-WC (WO), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39653, 2011 WL 1375297, at *5 (M.D. Ala. Apr. 12, 2011) (citations omitted). Thus, Howard may create an issue of fact at the pretext stage by (1) presenting evidence that MHT's proffered reason is not worthy of belief, thereby enabling the jury to infer that discrimination was its real reason, or (2) presenting evidence that discrimination was, in fact, MHT's real reason. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 146-47, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993); see also Hammonds v. Hyundai Motor Mfg. Ala., LLC, No. 2:10-cv-103-TFM, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69264, 2011 WL 2580168, at *6 (M.D. Ala. June 28, 2011).
"Pretext means more than a mistake on the part of the employer; pretext means a lie, specifically a phony reason for some action." Tolley v. United Parcel Serv., No. Civ.A.1:05CV606TWT, 2006 WL 486523, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 27, 2006) (citation and internal marks [*48]  omitted). "Thus, the inquiry is limited to whether [MHT ] offered an honest, nondiscriminatory explanation for terminating [Howard ], regardless of whether the decision might have been mistaken." Id. (citations omitted); see also Castillo v. Roche Labs., Inc., 467 F. App'x 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted) ("That an employer's legitimate belief was mistaken is irrelevant so long as [discriminatory] animus did not motivate it."). That is, "the relevant inquiry is not whether [MHT] . . . treated [Howard] justly, fairly, or sensibly. It is whether [ MHT] asserted a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the [employment action], and if so, whether [Howard] has shown that [ MHT's] reason[s were] not the actual reason[s], but [were] pretext for discrimination[.]" Diggs v. Potter, 700 F. Supp. 2d 20, 47 (D.D.C. 2010) (citations omitted). "A reason is not pretext unless the plaintiff shows that it is false, and that discrimination was the real reason." Castillo, 467 F. App'x at 863 (citation omitted). "Ultimately, [] [Howard] must meet [ MHT's] stated reason[s] 'head on and rebut [them], and [he] cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of th[e] reason[s].'" Young, 432 F. App'x at 917 (sixth alteration in original) (citation omitted). "Regardless of presumptions, the ultimate burden lies with [Howard] to show intentional [*49]  discrimination." Walker v. St. Joseph's/Candler Health Sys., Inc., 506 F. App'x 886, 888 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted).
In an effort to show pretext, Howard simply denies "Krampe's allegations of insubordination," asserting that he "was tasked by Wagner to filter communications from Krampe, and Krampe himself hired [him] to specifically change the company culture of MHT." [Doc. 36 at 18 (citation omitted)]. Howard maintains that because "Wagner directed [him] to ensure Krampe kept his focus on sales tasks rather than get involved in the manufacturing operations," that he "was specifically brought onboard to MHT by Krampe to change the company culture in the office," and that he "did not meet the September 30, 2019 deadline because he was instructed by Wagner not to complete the project," which "required an extension into March 2020," so Krampe "terminated Howard's employment under pretext of a history of insubordination and poor performance." [Id. at 15-16, 18-19 (citations omitted)].
The evidence of record, however, belies Howard's assertion that because he was hired to help change the office culture at MHT, his actions towards Krampe were not insubordinate. Indeed, after Howard responded to one of Krampe's emails stating that they should [*50]  "stay[] in [their] perspective [sic] lanes" and that he was "purposely keeping [Krampe] out of email strings both internal and external emails that [were] out of [his] scope of work," Wagner clearly advised Howard that while it was correct that he wanted Howard "to be the main project engineer for all projects in the Americas" so that Krampe would "have more time to focus on sales and managing tasks," Krampe, as the CEO of MHT, "always [had] the right to be informed about the status of the projects" and that he was "aways [to] consider [Krampe] as [his] direct manager." [Doc. 35-2 at 38-40; Doc. 35-3 at 63-65 pp. 62-64]. And, while Howard explains that he did not complete the assigned project by the September 30, 2019, deadline because Wagner did not want the project completed at that time, which prompted Krampe to extend the deadline to March 2020, and again to May 31, 2020, when he did not meet the March deadline, Howard has offered no explanation for the failure to meet those extended deadlines, and he admitted that when questioned about the assigned task upon his return to work on July 6, 2020, he refused to complete the project and also refused to change workstations. [Doc. 35-2 [*51]  at 5-6; Doc. 35-3 at 53-55 pp. 52-54, 70 p. 69, 74 p. 73, 79-80 pp. 78-79].
"The inquiry into pretext centers on the employer's beliefs, not the employee's beliefs and, to be blunt about it, not on reality as it exists outside of the decision maker's head." Calicchio v. Oasis Outsourcing Grp. Holdings, L.P., 584 F. Supp. 3d 1215, 1250 (S.D. Fla. 2021) (citation and internal marks omitted), aff'd, No. 21-12854, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 19538, 2022 WL 2761720 (11th Cir. July 15, 2022) (per curiam). Although Howard generally disputes that he engaged in insubordinate behavior, he admits that he did not complete the requested assignment, he admits that he refused to complete the assignment, and he admits that he refused to change workstations. [Doc. 35-3 at 53-55 pp. 52-54, 70 p. 69, 74 p. 73, 79-80 pp. 78-79]. "To show pretext, [ Howard] must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Williams v. Hous. Auth. of Savannah, Inc., 834 F. App'x 482, 490 (11th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation and internal marks omitted). Thus, "even resolving [any] factual disputes in [Howard's] favor, the evidence does not suggest pretext in [MHT's] proffered reason[s] for [his] termination." Id. Howard "has not pointed to any evidence to show that [Krampe's] . . . beliefs [*52]  . . . were not honestly held." Oliver v. TECO Energy, Inc., No. 8:12-cv-2117-T-33TBM, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180372, 2013 WL 6836421, at *10 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 26, 2013); see also Feise v. N. Broward Hosp. Dist., 683 F. App'x 746, 753 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (unpublished). "The Court will not second-guess [ MHT's] assessment[] and ultimate decision; [the Court is] not interested in whether the conclusion is a correct one, but whether it is an honest one." Scott, 38 F. Supp. 3d at 1364 (second and third alterations in original) (citation and internal marks omitted).
To the extent Howard also attempts to show pretext based on the timing of his termination by pointing out that he returned to work on July 6, 2020; he informed Krampe on July 8, 2020, of his upcoming doctor's appointment; that Krampe observed him walking with a limp on July 9, 2020; and that Krampe terminated his employment on July 9, 2020, after which he received an MS diagnosis on July 10, 2020, though he admits he never made Krampe aware of such diagnosis, [Doc. 36 at 15-16 (citations omitted)], MHT has established that Krampe first initiated communications with Human Resources regarding possible disciplinary options, including termination, as early as June 1, 2020, but because Howard was not feeling well and then had to quarantine due to his COVID-19 symptoms, the first opportunity Krampe had to discuss his concerns regarding Howard's performance [*53]  was upon Howard's return to work on July 6, 2020, at which time Howard engaged in further insubordinate behavior, prompting Krampe to immediately ask Human Resources and Wagner about terminating Howard, which was approved with a planned termination date of July 9, 2020, [Doc. 35-2 at 5-7, 42-43, 45-46; Doc. 35-3 at 74-75 pp. 73-74, 78-79 pp. 77-78; Doc. 35-4 at 12-14 pp. 11-13, 25-26 pp. 24-25, 28-29 pp. 27-28, 44 p. 43]. Thus, the evidence shows that Krampe again inquired about terminating Howard on July 6, 2020, prior to being informed about any scheduled medical appointments on July 8 and prior to observing Howard walk with a limp on July 9, 2020, and that Howard never informed Krampe of a specific disability prior to his termination. [Doc. 35-2 at 6-7, 49, 51; Doc. 35-3 at 42-44 pp. 41-43, 99 p. 98; Doc. 35-4 at 12-13 pp. 11-12, 45-46 pp. 44-45].
"The temporal proximity [here] . . . qualifies as a nonstarter" because "[a]mple precedent establishes that employers need not suspend previously planned [discipline] . . ., and their proceeding along lines previously contemplated . . . is no evidence what[so]ever of causality." Moncrief v. Fed.-Mogul Powertrain LLC, Case No. 5:20-cv-01215-HNJ, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82937, 2022 WL 1405417, at *21 (N.D. Ala. Mar. 30, 2022) (fourth alteration in original) (citations and internal marks [*54]  omitted). That is, "[t]he mere fact that [Howard's] discharge was effectuated after [he returned from a COVID-19 quarantine period and informed Krampe of another medical appointment that week] . . . does not preclude the grant of summary judgment." Andrews v. United Way of Sw. Ala., Inc., No. CIV. A. 98-1142-P-C, 2000 WL 210694, at *11 (S.D. Ala. Jan. 26, 2000) (citation and internal marks omitted); see also Howard v. Steris Corp., 886 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1292 (M.D. Ala. 2012) (explaining that Eleventh Circuit precedent made "clear that an employee has to tell his employer about his specific disability before the ADA triggers an obligation to accommodate him or refrain from firing him because of the disability"), aff'd, 550 F. App'x 748 (11th Cir. 2013) (unpublished).
Howard "cannot establish pretext by simply demonstrating facts that suggest [discriminatory] animus, but must specifically respond to each of [ MHT's] explanations and rebut them," Burgos-Stefanelli v. Sec'y, U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 410 F. App'x 243, 247 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted), and Howard has failed to specifically address MHT's evidence demonstrating that at the time Krampe made the decision to fire him, he had not yet been diagnosed with a disabling impairment, made Krampe aware of any disabling impairment, or requested any accommodation or leave for his medical appointment. Courts are "not in the business of adjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair. Instead, [*55]  [the] sole concern is whether unlawful discriminatory animus motivates a challenged employment decision." Goodman, 147 F. App'x at 891 (citation and internal marks omitted). "If the plaintiff fails to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the employer's articulated reasons for the adverse employment action are pretextual, then the employer is entitled to summary judgment on the [discrimination] claim." Rowell v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., No. 1:12-cv-0491-WSD, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164057, 2013 WL 6080274, at *17 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 18, 2013) (alteration in original) (citation and internal marks omitted), adopted at *4. "The Court will not second-guess [MHT's] assessment[] and ultimate decision[.]" Scott, 38 F. Supp. 3d at 1364 (second alteration in original) (citation and internal marks omitted).
In sum, Howard "has [] failed to show that [his alleged] disability was the real reason for [his] termination." Jones v. Aaron's Inc., 748 F. App'x 907, 915 (11th Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (unpublished); see also Lopez v. AT & T, Corp., 457 F. App'x 872, 875 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (finding plaintiff failed to establish that defendant terminated his employment because of his disability and that "the opposite appeared to be true"). Howard "has not pointed to any evidence which would allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the decisionmaker[] involved in [terminating his employment was] motivated by [discriminatory] animus." Morris v. Duncan, Civil Action File No. 1:08-CV-3566-JFK, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40095, 2011 WL 1397431, at *15 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 12, 2011). Accordingly, because [*56]  Howard "has failed to meet his burden to create an issue of material fact as to whether [his] termination . . . was a pretext for [disability discrimination]," Lamar v. Pilgrim's Pride Corp., No. 3:13-cv-1101-J-34JBT, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123081, 2015 WL 5440342, at *15 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 15, 2015); see also Brooks v. Cnty. Comm'n of Jefferson Cnty., 446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir. 2006) (alterations, citations, and internal marks omitted) ("To avoid summary judgment the plaintiff must introduce significantly probative evidence showing that the asserted reason is merely a pretext for discrimination. A reason is not pretext for discrimination unless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason."), it is RECOMMENDED that MHT's summary judgment motion as to Howard's ADA discrimination claim be GRANTED.

3. Howard's Failure to Accommodate Claim
Howard also asserts a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA against MHT. See [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 63-69]. MHT moves for summary judgment on this claim, arguing that Howard "did not request any accommodation," that he "did not provide any doctors' notifications that he had a disabling condition or that he needed alterations or modifications to the workplace to allow him to perform his job's essential functions," and that his "own testimony contradicts his contention that he requested any accommodation for a disability." [Doc. [*57]  35-10 at 13 (emphasis omitted)]. Howard contends that while MHT points out that the "evidence does not show [he] made a request for accommodation," MHT's "knowledge of [his] ongoing medical issues put MHT on sufficient notice that obligated MHT to engage in the interactive process of providing reasonable accommodations, which it did not do." [Doc. 36 at 19-20]. He therefore asserts that because Krampe was "well aware of Howard's medical condition and need for reasonable accommodations," MHT should have engaged in the interactive process as required by the ADA instead of deciding to terminate his employment. [Id. at 21].
"[A]n employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless the plaintiff makes a specific demand for an accommodation." Wiggins v. City of Montgomery, CASE NO. 2:17-CV-425-KFP, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37492, 2022 WL 625075, at *17 (M.D. Ala. Mar. 3, 2022) (citation omitted). "If a specific demand is made, however, the ADA provides that an employer may need to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of an accommodation to identify the person's precise limitations and potential reasonable accommodations." Id. (citation and internal marks omitted). "[F]or a demand to be specific enough to trigger the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation, [*58]  the defendant must have enough information to know of both the disability and desire for an accommodation, or circumstances must at least be sufficient to cause a reasonable [employer] to make appropriate inquiries about the possible need for an accommodation." Id. (alterations in original) (internal marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Hialeah Hous. Auth., 418 F. App'x 872, 876 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished)). That is, "[b]efore an employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation—or even to participate in the interactive process—is triggered, the employee must make an adequate request that puts the employer on notice." Id. (citation omitted). Indeed, in order for an employee "who makes a demand for an accommodation" to "meet [his] obligation to demonstrate that [his] requested accommodation is reasonable," he "must do at least two things: identify [his] disability and suggest how the accommodation will overcome [his] physical or mental limitations." Owens v. Governor's Off. of Student Achievement, 52 F.4th 1327, 1334 (11th Cir. 2022). Thus, an "accommodation can qualify as reasonable . . . only [i]f it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job," but "an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner that the employee desires—or even provide that employee's preferred accommodation." [*59]  Id. at 1335 (first alteration in original) (emphasis, citations, and internal marks omitted). While "an employee's informational burden [is considered] to be modest," to "trigger an employer's accommodation duties, a disabled employee need only identify a statutory disability and explain generally how a particular accommodation would assist h[im]." Id. at 1336.34
Because the ADA only "requires an employer to accommodate an employee with a known disability," and the "initial burden is on [Howard] to show he made a sufficient request for a reasonable accommodation," Andrews v. Cobb Cnty. Sch. Dist., CIVIL ACTION FILE NO. 1:20-CV-04043-MLB-WEJ, 2021 WL 6113735, at *11 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 28, 2021) (emphasis added) (footnote, citation and internal marks omitted), adopted by 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117183, 2022 WL 2387058, at *9 (N.D. Ga. July 1, 2022), Howard's claim fails as a matter of law. Indeed, Howard's advisement of an upcoming doctor's appointment upon his return to work and the fact that he was walking with a limp is simply "insufficient to place [ MHT] on notice that [ Howard] was requesting a reasonable accommodation when [MHT] did not know he was disabled." Id., at *12 (citations omitted); see also Hamilton v. Schneider Nat'l Carriers Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:17-CV-3264-MHC-JSA, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 235850, 2019 WL 11553744, at *17 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 24, 2019) (citation and internal marks omitted) (finding submission of a physician's medical certifications setting out work restrictions was insufficient "to trigger an employer's obligation to engage in the interactive [*60]  process to determine whether a reasonable accommodation [could] be made, in the absence of any evidence that the employer was aware that the employee had a physical or mental impairment that could be considered a disability under the ADA"), adopted by 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 235836, 2019 WL 11553748, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 7, 2019). In short, Howard "has not pointed to evidence showing that at any time after he returned to work on [July 6, 2020], he identified an accommodation that would have allowed him to perform the essential functions of the job," and "[a]s a result, [MHT] did not have an affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process." Medearis v. CVS Pharmacy, 92 F. Supp. 3d 1294, 1310 (N.D. Ga. 2015) (citations omitted), aff'd sub nom. Medearis v. CVS Pharmacy, Inc., 646 F. App'x 891 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam) (unpublished). Thus, Howard's claim that MHT discriminated against him by failing to "make the necessary inquiries about [his] needs for reasonable accommodations," since MHT was aware that he had a doctor's appointment scheduled shortly after he returned to work on July 6, 2020, and observed him walking with a limp on July 9, 2020, [Doc. 36 at 21 (citations omitted)], "amounts to nothing but [v]ague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity," Owens, 52 F.4th at 1337 (alteration in original) (citation and internal marks omitted), which was insufficient to trigger any duty [*61]  on the part of MHT, and it is therefore RECOMMENDED that MHT's summary judgment motion as to Howard's ADA failure to accommodate claim be GRANTED.

4. Howard's ADA Retaliation Claim
Howard alleges that MHT "retaliated against [him] for engaging in protected activity when [he] requested reasonable accommodations under the ADA by terminating his employment." [Doc. 1 ¶ 71]. MHT also moves for summary judgment on this claim, arguing that Howard has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA and cannot show that their proffered reasons are pretext for unlawful retaliation. [Doc. 35-10 at 15-20; Doc. 40 at 10-11].
"To state a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, [ Howard] must show that (1) he engaged in statutorily protected conduct; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action." Upton v. Day & Zimmerman NPS, Civil Action Number 2:15-cv-02131-AKK, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7758, 2018 WL 465979, at *6 (N.D. Ala. Jan. 18, 2018) (citing Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 (11th Cir. 2000)); see also McConico v. City of Tampa, 823 F. App'x 763, 768 (11th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). And, "disability retaliation claims require a plaintiff to meet the heightened 'but-for' causation standard." Leone v. All. Foods, Inc., No. 8:14-cv-800-T-27TBM, 2015 WL 4879406, at *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 14, 2015) (citations omitted) (citing Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013)).
MHT does not dispute the second element, but instead argues that Howard [*62]  cannot establish that he engaged in statutorily protected activity or that there is a causal connection because he has failed to show that Krampe was aware of his alleged protected activity when he first inquired about disciplinary actions for performance and insubordination in early June 2020. [Doc. 35-10 at 16-20]. In particular, MHT first points out that Howard "made no request for reasonable accommodation at any time during his employment"; that Howard "cannot provide any support for his claim that, when he demanded 'federal coverage' for his COVID-19 related absences from work, he believed that he was disabled and that this belief was objectively reasonable," especially since he "admitted he did not know what was wrong with him while he was absent from June 12, 2020 through July 3, 2020," and also "admitted that his own supervisor did not know that [Howard] suffered from any disabling condition"; that Howard "failed to present evidence that his alleged requested accommodation - medical leave under the FFCRA - was a 'reasonable accommodation' under the ADA"; and that "[b]ecause [Howard] failed to connect his demand for paid medical leave to any known disability, he could not have [*63]  had a good faith, reasonable belief that he was engaging in protected activity." [Id. at 16-18 (citations omitted)].
MHT also asserts that "[e]ven if [Howard] could establish that he 'engaged in statutorily protected activity,' which he cannot, [Howard] cannot show a causal connection between any alleged protected activity and his termination on July 9, 2020." [Id. at 18]. In particular, MHT asserts that Krampe "considered ending [Howard's] employment . . . as early as June 1, 2020," and that Howard's "July 6th insubordinate conduct broke any causal link between his alleged protected activity — his purported request for 'a brief medical leave of absence' in mid-June 2020 - and his termination." [Id. at 19 (emphasis and citation omitted)]. Thus, MHT contends that Howard's "retaliation claim under the ADA fails and should be dismissed." [Id. at 19-20]. Because Howard has failed to establish a causal connection between his alleged protected activity and his termination, he has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA.
The undisputed evidence shows that the allegedly retaliatory act about which Howard complains, i.e., the decision to terminate his employment, was [*64]  first contemplated by Krampe in early June 2020, prior to Howard engaging in his purported protected activity of seeking coverage for his absences under the FFCRA on June 23, 2020.35 [Doc. 35-2 at 5-6, 42-43, 45-46; Doc. 35-3 at 77 p. 76; Doc. 35-4 at 25-26 pp. 24-25, 28-29 pp. 27-28]. Once he returned to work on July 6, 2020, Howard engaged in what Krampe perceived was additional insubordinate conduct, and Krampe again consulted with Human Resources and Wagner and sought approval to discharge Howard. [Doc. 35-2 at 6-7; Doc. 35-3 at 78-80 pp. 77-79; Doc. 35-4 at 13-14 pp. 12-13, 44 p. 43].
To establish a causal connection in a retaliation claim, Howard is required to satisfy the traditional principles of but-for causation, which "requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer." Griffith v. Exel, Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:14-CV-1754-ODE-JSA, 2016 WL 8938585, at *23 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 5, 2016) (citation and internal marks omitted), adopted by 2016 WL 8938512, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 25, 2016). "In order to establish a causal connection between protected conduct and an adverse employment action, however, at a minimum, a plaintiff must generally establish that the employer was actually aware of the protected expression at the time it took the adverse employment [*65]  action." Id. (alteration, citations, and internal marks omitted). That is, "[i]t is only logical that a plaintiff's protected activity must take place before the alleged retaliatory actions; otherwise, the plaintiff cannot demonstrate a causal link between the protected activity and the alleged retaliation." Perkins v. Lynch, 169 F. Supp. 3d 1246, 1252 (N.D. Ala. 2016) (citation omitted); see also Cheatham v. DeKalb Cnty., 682 F. App'x 881, 887 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (unpublished) (finding plaintiff failed to establish the third element of a prima facie case of retaliation—causal link--because the "alleged adverse employment actions . . . all occurred before [the] statutorily-protected activities were undertaken"); Rollins v. Ala. Cmty. Coll. Sys., 814 F. Supp. 2d 1250, 1313 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (citing Schechter v. Ga. State Univ., 341 F. App'x 560, 563 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (unpublished)) (finding "no causal connection where adverse employment action occurred before protected activity"). "As the Eleventh Circuit has stated, this requirement rests upon common sense" as "[a] decision maker cannot have been motivated to retaliate by something unknown to him." Griffith, 2016 WL 8938585, at *23 (citation and internal marks omitted).
Despite Howard's arguments to the contrary and his reliance on temporal proximity, [Doc. 36 at 17], "the undisputed evidence shows that the decision to [take disciplinary action, including termination, with respect to Howard's employment] was [*66]  made by [Krampe] prior to [Howard's] engaging in [alleged] protected activity, and the mere fact that the decision to terminate [him] was not carried out until after []he engaged in [alleged] protected activity is simply not probative of retaliatory intent in this case," Simpson v. Chamberlain Univ. LLC, CIVIL CASE NO. 1:19-cv-01261-SCJ-RGV, 2020 WL 10224094, at *24 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 30, 2020) (citations omitted), adopted by 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124767, 2021 WL 2652333, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 9, 2021). "Employers need not suspend previously planned [adverse employment actions] upon discovering [protected activity], and their proceeding along lines previously contemplated, though not yet definitively determined, is no evidence whatever of causality." Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 272, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001)); McMullen v. Tuskegee Univ., 184 F. Supp. 3d 1316, 1321-22 (M.D. Ala. 2016) (citation and internal marks omitted) (explaining that "[w]hen an employer makes a tentative decision before protected activity occurs, the fact that an employer proceeds with such a decision is not evidence of causation" and finding that "even if the decision to terminate [plaintiff] was not finalized at the time [she] filed her complaint, a belief that following through with that decision was retaliation [was] not . . . objectively reasonable" and that summary judgment was therefore due to be granted on her retaliation claim).36 "Thus, even assuming that [Howard] had engaged in [] protected activity when []he [emailed Krampe on June [*67]  23, 2020], the [Court] finds that [he] has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII." Gladden v. Procter & Gamble Distrib. LLC, CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:19-CV-2938-CAP-JSA, 2021 WL 4930535, at *44 (N.D. Ga. July 26, 2021), adopted by 2021 WL 4929913, at *9 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 8, 2021), aff'd, No. 21-13535, 2022 WL 2974066 (11th Cir. July 27, 2022) (per curiam).
Even if Howard had established a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, for the reasons discussed with regard to his disability discrimination claim, Howard's retaliation claim still fails because he has not shown that MHT's proffered legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for his termination were pretext for retaliation. MHT asserts that it terminated Howard due to his job performance deficiencies and insubordinate conduct. [Doc. 35-10 at 15, 19; Doc. 40 at 10-11]. As previously discussed, these reasons constitute legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for Howard's termination, thereby satisfying MHT's "exceedingly light" burden and shifting the onus to Howard to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that MHT's reasons are pretext for prohibited, retaliatory conduct. See Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., 408 F.3d 763, 770 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted); see also Belgrave v. Publix Super Mkt., Inc., No. 22-13021, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 11889, 2023 WL 3477790, at *4 (11th Cir. May 16, 2023) (per curiam) (finding plaintiff's poor job performance and insubordination, among other things, were legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for his termination that occurred shortly after his head injury). To [*68]  establish pretext, Howard "must present concrete evidence in the form of specific facts which show [MHT's] proffered reason[s are] mere pretext." Smith v. Harvey, 421 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1378 (S.D. Ala. 2006) (citation and internal marks omitted). Again, Howard must meet MHT's reasons "head on and rebut [them]." Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir. 2000) (footnote and citations omitted).
Howard attempts to prove pretext in the same manner he did with respect to his ADA disability discrimination claim, see [Doc. 36 at 17-19], and the Court has already addressed these arguments and found them to be unpersuasive. "For the same reasons that this Court rejected [his] attempts to establish pretext for th[at] claim[], the Court finds that []he has failed to introduce any evidence from which a jury could infer pretext for [his] retaliation claim." Philson v. Hosp. Auth. of Houston Cnty., Civil Action No. 5:08-CV-155 (HL), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69810, 2009 WL 2477255, at *15 (M.D. Ga. Aug. 10, 2009); see also Anderson v. Dunbar Armored, Inc., 678 F. Supp. 2d 1280, 1315-16 (N.D. Ga. 2009), adopted at 1290. In sum, Howard has failed to "produce[] any evidence, outside of his own conclusory say-so, that would support an inference of [ retaliation] from the circumstances," and the Eleventh Circuit has "repeatedly and emphatically held[ that] employers may terminate an employee for a good or bad reason without violating federal law." Flowers v. Troup Cnty., Ga., Sch. Dist., 803 F.3d 1327, 1337-38 (11th Cir. 2015) (citation and internal marks omitted). "Because [Howard] has the burden of persuasion . . ., [*69]  it is his responsibility to advance sufficient evidence of [ retaliation] to create a triable factual dispute," id. at 1338, but he has failed to do so. Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that MHT's motion for summary judgment on Howard's retaliation claim under the ADA be GRANTED.37

B. Howard's FMLA Claims

1. Howard's Employee Status
MHT first asserts that it "cannot qualify as a covered employer under the FMLA" since it "employed fewer than fifty employees within seventy-five miles of its Peachtree City office, and thus it is not subject to the FMLA." [Doc. 35-10 at 20 (citation omitted)].38 "In order for the FMLA to apply, the employer[] at issue must have at least 50 employees within a 75 miles radius of the worksite." Hegre v. Alberto-Culver USA, Inc., 485 F. Supp. 2d 1367, 1373 (S.D. Ga. 2007) (citation and internal marks omitted), aff'd, 275 F. App'x 872 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (unpublished); see also Salazar v. First Nat. Pawn, Inc., No. CV-10-59-BLG-RFC, 2011 WL 111413, at *1 (D. Mont. Jan. 13, 2011) (citation omitted) ("Under the FMLA, an 'eligible employee' does not include 'any employee of an employer who is employed at a worksite at which such employer employs less than 50 employees if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is less than 50."). Here, as MHT points out, it is undisputed that Howard "worked at MHT's sole U.S. office, [*70]  located in Peachtree City, Georgia"; that he "worked with only three to four employees who physically reported to MHT's office"; and as discussed earlier, Howard "does not have any evidence that MHT employed more than fifteen employees, let alone fifty employees." [Doc. 40 at 5-6 (citations omitted)].
Because it is undisputed that Howard worked at MHT's Peachtree City, Georgia, office, which was the only office based in the United States, and that this office did not employ fifty or more employees during the applicable time period, he has failed to show that he was a covered employee under the FMLA. Hegre, 485 F. Supp. 2d at 1376. "Moreover, even assuming an 'integrated employer' relationship between [MHT and MHT Technology], at the time [Howard] alleges his [adverse action], [MHT Technology ] did not have at least 50 employees within a 75 mile radius of the [Peachtree City, Georgia, office]," and "[c]onsequently, even assuming the existence of an 'integrated employer' relationship amongst [MHT and MHT Technology, Howard] cannot establish that [there was] at least 50 employees within a 75 mile radius of [the U.S.-based MHT location]." Salazar, 2011 WL 111413, at *2-3 (footnote and citation omitted). Thus, Howard has failed [*71]  to show he was an eligible employee, and his "FMLA claims fail as a matter of law, irrespective of [his] characterization of [his] claims as alleging 'interference' or 'retaliation.'" Hegre, 485 F. Supp. 2d at 1376 (footnote omitted); see also Kuczynski v. Lyra Mgmt. Inc., No. 08-62067-CIV, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71116, 2009 WL 2488295, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 13, 2009) (granting defendant's partial summary judgment motion on plaintiff's FMLA claim because the evidence showed that defendant did not employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of his worksite); Taylor v. Texaco, Inc., 510 F. Supp. 2d 1255, 1265 (N.D. Ga. 2007) (finding plaintiff "failed to offer evidence that would demonstrate the existence of 50 or more employees within 75 miles of the [plaintiff's] workplace").39

2. Howard's FMLA Retaliation Claim
Howard asserts a retaliation claim under the FMLA. [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 48-54]. MHT moves for summary judgment on this claim, contending that Howard's "retaliation claims under the FMLA simply reiterate his ADA retaliation claims and should be dismissed for the [same] reasons [as his ADA retaliation claims]." [Doc. 35-10 at 21 (footnote omitted)]. In response, Howard maintains that he "engaged in statutorily protected activity when [he] requested to take leave under the FFCRA" and that the "record shows MHT was aware of [his] protected activity and there was [*72]  close temporal proximity between [his] protected activity and the adverse action[] he suffered." [Doc. 36 at 14].
"FMLA retaliation is distinct from FMLA interference in that to succeed on a FMLA retaliation claim, an employee must demonstrate that his employer intentionally discriminated against him in the form of an adverse employment action for having exercised an FMLA right." Bradley v. Army Fleet Support, LLC, 54 F. Supp. 3d 1272, 1282 (M.D. Ala. 2014) (citing Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir. 2010)); see also Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236, 1243 (11th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).40 That is, "[u]nlike an interference claim, an employee 'bringing a retaliation claim faces the increased burden of showing that his employer's actions were motivated by an impermissible retaliatory or discriminatory animus.'" Martin v. Brevard Cnty. Public Schs., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267-68 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (quoting Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1207 (11th Cir. 2001)); Gutter v. GuideOne Mut. Ins. Co., 17 F. Supp. 3d 1261, 1272 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (citation omitted).
"Where, as here, [] [Howard] alleges an FMLA retaliation claim without direct evidence of [ MHT's] retaliatory intent, [the Court will] apply the burden shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp.[.]" Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., 439 F.3d 1286, 1297 (11th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). As with Howard's ADA retaliation claim, "[u]nder this framework, [] [Howard] must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation," Rodriguez v. Univ. of Miami Hosp., 499 F. App'x 920, 925 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); Andrews v. CSX Transp., Inc., 737 F. Supp. 2d 1342, 1354 (M.D. Fla. 2010) (citation omitted), which "requires only that [] [Howard] establish facts adequate [*73]  to permit an inference of [retaliation]," Jirau v. Camden Dev., Inc., No. 8:11-cv-73-T-33MAP, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113186, 2011 WL 4529983, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2011) (citation and internal marks omitted). "Once [] [Howard] makes this prima facie showing, the burden then shifts to [ MHT] 'to articulate a legitimate reason for the adverse action,'" and "[i]f [ MHT] does, the burden then shifts back to [ Howard] to show that this reason is pretext for unlawful [retaliation]." Gutter, 17 F. Supp. 3d at 1272 (citations omitted); see also Rudy v. Walter Coke, Inc., 613 F. App'x 828, 830 (11th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citations omitted).
"In order to state a claim of retaliation, [ Howard] must allege that: (1) []he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) []he suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) the decision was causally related to protected activity." Arora v. Dental Health Grp., P.A., 898 F. Supp. 2d 1307, 1311 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (citation omitted). In other words, Howard must show that "he suffered an adverse action, and that the action was because he exercised an FMLA right." Connor v. Sun Trust Bank, 546 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1373 (N.D. Ga. 2008); see also Bentley v. Orange Cnty., 445 F. App'x 306, 309 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citations omitted) ("To state a claim for retaliation under the FMLA, the employee must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) []he is entitled to the claimed benefit, (2) []he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) the adverse action was 'intentional' and 'motivated' by [his] participation in the protected activity, [*74]  establishing a causal connection.").
MHT contends that Howard's FMLA retaliation claim should be dismissed for the same reasons as his ADA retaliation claim. [Doc. 35-10 at 21-22]. The Court agrees. With respect to his prima facie case, Howard must show that "there [was] a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment decision." Morgan v. Orange Cnty., 477 F. App'x 625, 628 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (alteration in original) (citation and internal marks omitted). "To establish that causal connection, [] [Howard] need only show 'that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.'" Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting Simmons v. Camden Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 757 F.2d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 1985) (per curiam)); see also Sprinkle v. City of Douglas, 621 F. Supp. 2d 1327, 1351-52 (S.D. Ga. 2008) (citation omitted). "In order to show the two things were not entirely unrelated, [] [Howard] must generally show that the decision maker was aware of the protected conduct at the time of the adverse employment action." Brungart, 231 F.3d at 799 (citations omitted).41
Howard asserts that he can "show that his protected activity is not 'wholly unrelated to' the adverse employment action as Krampe actively discouraged [him] from exercising his federally protected requests for medical leave, and forc[ed] [him] to use vacation days and PTO to account for the missing days." [Doc. 36 [*75]  at 14]. While Krampe did advise Howard that he was not eligible to take leave under the FFCRA under the belief that since MHT had less than 50 employees, it did not fall under that Act, Krampe specifically testified that during Howard's period of absence from June 12, 2020, through July 3, 2020, MHT ultimately paid him his regular compensation and Howard was not required to use any of his PTO, and Howard has not offered any evidence to refute Krampe's testimony, or otherwise denied that this was the case. [Doc. 35-4 at 21-23 pp. 20-22]. Moreover, Krampe contemplated taking disciplinary action, including termination, prior to Howard's request that his leave be covered under the FFRCA and then merely proceeded along those lines previously contemplated following Howard's return to work from his leave and further engaging in insubordinate behavior, see [Doc. 35-2 at 6-7, 42-43; Doc. 35-3 at 78-80 pp. 77-79; Doc. 35-4 at 13-14 pp. 12-13, 25-26 pp. 24-25, 29 p. 28, 44 p. 43], and "there is no other evidence that a reasonable juror could consider beyond the timing of [Howard's] termination," but "[i]f the Court were to allow [Howard's] claim to go forward, despite the minimal evidence [ ] [*76]  presented, such a ruling would penalize [MHT] for making a ministerial choice to implement a non-discriminatory decision that the company formulated before any protected activity took place," which "is not the conduct that the FMLA is designed to prevent," Salameh v. Sears Holding Mgmt. Corp., No. 08 C 4372, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4351, 2010 WL 183361, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 13, 2010). Rather, the "FMLA is a shield to prevent an employer from acting pursuant to a prohibited animus, it is not a sword with which employees can disrupt their employer's non-actionable decisions." Id. For the same reasons as discussed with Howard's ADA retaliation claim, Howard has "failed to present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to causal connection for [his] FMLA retaliation . . . claim[]," and MHT is "entitled to summary judgment on [this] claim[]." Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1235; see also Banks v. Marketsource, Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:18-CV-2235-WMR-JSA, 2019 WL 8277274, at *10-11 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 5, 2019) (emphasis and citation omitted) (finding that the "contemporaneous emails show[ed], as [d]efendant assert[ed], that [p]laintiff's termination was underway prior to her requesting taking her FMLA leave" and that the "timing in itself [did] not create a genuine issue of fact, when the contemporaneous paper trail so clearly show[ed] that the decision had been made earlier" and that plaintiff had therefore failed to show "a causal link between the exercise [*77]  of a right and an adverse employment action"), adopted by 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55414, 2020 WL 6291422, at *11 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 20, 2020).
Furthermore, even if Howard could establish a prima facie case, his claim still fails because MHT terminated his employment for legitimate, nonretaliatory reasons, which he has failed to show were pretext for FMLA retaliation. As previously discussed, MHT's non-retaliatory reasons of job performance deficiency and insubordination constitute "'clear and reasonably specific'" non-retaliatory explanations for MHT's decision to terminate Howard's employment, and MHT has therefore discharged its burden of production, see Vessels, 408 F.3d at 770 (citation omitted), and the burden shifts back to Howard to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reasons provided by MHT are pretext for a prohibited, retaliatory motive, see Edmond, 441 F. App'x at 724; Tiggs-Vaughn, 385 F. App'x at 923; Ashe v. Aronov Homes, Inc., 354 F. Supp. 2d 1251, 1264 (M.D. Ala. 2004) (citation omitted). To the extent Howard attempts to show pretext with respect to his FMLA retaliation claim by relying on his arguments made with respect to his claims under the ADA, see [Doc. 36 at 17-19], "[f]or the same reasons that this Court rejected [his] attempts to establish pretext for [his ADA] claims, the Court finds that []he has failed to introduce any evidence from which a jury could infer pretext for [his [*78]  FMLA] retaliation claim," Philson, 2009 WL 2477255, at *15; see also Bankston v. Sewon Am., Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:15-cv-00207-TCB-RGV, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64209, 2018 WL 1779451, at *17 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 31, 2018) (granting summary judgment where plaintiff failed to meet his burden of showing an issue of material fact as to whether his termination was a pretext for retaliation under the FMLA), adopted by 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64664, 2018 WL 1783167, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 9, 2018); Hill v. N.Y. City Hous. Auth., 220 F. Supp. 3d 499, 508 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (finding plaintiff had "not demonstrated that [d]efendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory justification for her termination was merely pretextual" where "[p]laintiff's poor work performance[ was] clearly well-documented, predate[d] any application for FMLA leave, and [was] divorced from any retaliatory motive"). Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that MHT's motion for summary judgment as to Howard's FMLA retaliation claim be GRANTED.42

C. Howard's Claims under the EPSLA Provision of the FFCRA
Howard also asserts claims for interference and retaliation under the EPSLA provision of the FFCRA, premised on Krampe "erroneously inform[ing him] that he was not eligible for . . . FFCRA leave" and then terminating him shortly after his return to work from quarantine. [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 76-97; Doc. 36 at 22]. MHT moves for summary judgment as to these claims. See [Doc. 35-10 at 22-23].
"Congress enacted the FFCRA in March 2020 to address issues stemming from the [*79]  COVID-19 pandemic." Alvarado, 2022 WL 19686, at *3 (footnote omitted). "Division E of the FFCRA is the [EPSLA]," which provides that "[a]n employer shall provide to each employee employed by the employer paid sick time to the extent that the employee is unable to work (or telework) due to a need for leave because . . . [t]he employee has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19."43 Colombe v. Sgn, Inc., No. 5:20-CV-374-REW, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59485, 2021 WL 1198304, at *3 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 29, 2021) (second and fourth alterations in original) (footnote, citation, and internal marks omitted). "Section 5104 of the FFCRA makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge, discipline, or in any other manner discriminate against any employee who . . . takes leave in accordance with this Act[.]" Id. (alterations in original) (citations and internal marks omitted). "The enforcement provisions for failure to provide paid sick leave under the EPSLA are tied to the Fair Labor Standards Act ('FLSA')." King v. Okmulgee Cnty. Jail Tr. Auth., Case No. 21-cv-367-JFH-GLJ, 2023 WL 2976576, at *4 (E.D. Okla. Apr. 16, 2023) (citations omitted), adopted by 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66562, 2023 WL 2973879, at *1 (E.D. Okla. Apr. 17, 2023).
Howard's EPSLA interference claim fails because "[i]t is widely held that the EPSLA does not provide for an interference claim as it neither prohibits interference nor adopts or amends the FMLA." King, 2023 WL 2976576, at *4 (citations omitted); see also Alvarado, 2022 WL 19686, at *3 (explaining that "[u]nlike the [FMLA], there is no provision in the EPSLA that specifically [*80]  prohibits an employer from 'interfering' with an employee's rights under that statute" and therefore dismissing plaintiff's EPSLA interference claim); Kovacevic v. Am. Int'l Foods, Inc., Case No. 1:21-cv-72, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154590, 2021 WL 3629756, at *3 (W.D. Mich. Aug. 17, 2021) (explaining that plaintiff "cannot assert an 'interference with rights' claim under the EPSLA because that statute does not provide for such a claim"). The Court "agrees with these cases and concludes that the EPSLA does not provide for an interference claim and, therefore, [Howard] cannot assert such a claim." King, 2023 WL 2976576, at *4. Accordingly, Howard's interference claim under the EPSLA provision of the FFCRA is due to be dismissed.44
As for Howard's retaliation claim, it is "enforced under the FLSA," Toro v. Acme Barricades, L.C., Case No. 6:20-cv-1867-ACC-LRH, 2021 WL 3207632, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 9, 2021) (footnote and citation omitted), and Howard must therefore "satisfy the same requirements as a plaintiff asserting a claim for FLSA retaliation," which includes showing that he: "(1) [] engaged in activity protected under [the] act; (2) [] subsequently suffered adverse action by the employer; and (3) a causal connection existed between [his] activity and the adverse action," Haddon v. Jesse Stutts, Inc., Case No. 5:20-cv-01830-HNJ, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136786, 2021 WL 3089232, at *5 (N.D. Ala. July 22, 2021) (second and fourth alterations in original) (citation and internal marks omitted). Howard contends that "[f]or the reasons [previously] established," he "has established [*81]  a prima facie case of retaliation for exercising his FFCRA rights." [Doc. 36 at 24-25]. MHT maintains that Howard's retaliation claim fails for the same reasons as his FMLA retaliation claim. See [Doc. 35-10 at 23]. Because Howard has not offered any additional arguments or evidence in support of his retaliation claim under the EPSLA provision of the FFCRA, but merely relies on his previous arguments, for the reasons discussed with regard to his ADA and FMLA retaliation claims, the Court finds that Howard's EPSLA retaliation claim likewise is without merit. See Broner v. DeKalb Cnty., CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:03-CV-3877-CAP-CCH, 2005 WL 8154342, at *7 (N.D. Ga. July 6, 2005) (citations omitted) ("In the Eleventh Circuit, the proof structure in retaliation cases under both the FMLA and the FLSA is analytically similar to that for retaliation cases under Title VII."), adopted by 2005 WL 8154414, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 18, 2005). Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that MHT's motion for summary judgment as to Howard's interference and retaliation claims brought pursuant to the EPSLA provision of the FFCRA be GRANTED.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that MHT's motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 35], be GRANTED in its entirety.
The Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate this referral.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED and DIRECTED this 23rd day of June, [*82]  2023.
