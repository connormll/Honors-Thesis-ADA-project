Opinion



MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is presently before the Court on Plaintiff's Motion to the Court (Linda T. Walker) and Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. Docket Entries [26, 34]. For the reasons outlined below, Plaintiff's Motion to the Court is DENIED AS MOOT, and the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED. Docket Entries [26, 34].

DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Donald D. Anderson (hereinafter "Plaintiff"), who is proceeding pro se, filed the instant lawsuit on December 14, 2007. Therein, Plaintiff contends that Defendant Embarq/Sprint (hereinafter "Defendant") discriminated against him on the basis of his disability, race, and age when it refused to promote him, refused his request for light duty work after he injured himself off-the-job, [*2]  and terminated him in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101 et seq. (hereinafter "ADA"), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (hereinafter "Title VII"), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. (hereinafter "ADEA"). Plaintiff further contends that Defendant retaliated against him but neither specifies the retaliatory actions nor relevant applicable statute in his Complaint.
Defendant contends that summary judgment should be granted as to (1) any claim that accrued more than 180 days prior to the day Plaintiff filed his charge of discrimination (hereinafter "EEOC charge") with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission because they are time-barred; (2) Plaintiff's promotion claims because they are beyond the scope of his EEOC charges which only discussed the denial of Plaintiff's request for light duty and his termination; (3) Plaintiff's claims that Defendant's refusal of his request for light duty was discriminatory on the basis of his disability, age and race because given that he could not perform the essential functions of his job with or without an accommodation, he cannot show that he was qualified and he cannot show that Defendant's legitimate nondiscriminatory [*3]  reason for denying light duty was pretextual; (4) Plaintiff's claims that Defendant's refusal of his request for light duty was discriminatory on the basis of his age and race because he cannot identify similarly situated persons who were treated more favorably; (5) Plaintiff's discriminatory termination claims because he cannot show that he was qualified, was replaced by someone from outside his protected class, or that similarly situated employees were treated more favorably; and (6) Plaintiff's retaliation claims concerning Plaintiff's termination and Defendant's refusal of his request for light duty because Plaintiff cannot show that he engaged in protected opposition, demonstrate a causal connection between any alleged protected activity and Defendant's decision not to accommodate his request for light duty, or show that Defendant's proffered reason for denying light duty was a pretext for discrimination.

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS1
Plaintiff Donald Anderson was hired by Sprint North Supply Company on June 27, 2005. (DSMF ¶ 11). Sprint North Supply Company owned and operated a distribution center on 3000 Shawnee Ridge Court in Suwanee, Georgia. (DSMF ¶¶ 9). In April 2006, Sprint North [*4]  Supply Company's name was changed to Embarq Logistics, Inc. (DSMF ¶ 10). In May 2006, Embarq Logistics ceased to be affiliated with Sprint and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Embarq Corporation, who thereafter operated the distribution center. (DSMF ¶ 10). Although Plaintiff named Embarq/Sprint as the Defendant in this matter, Embarq and Sprint are trade names and not legal entities. (DSMF ¶ 9).
Plaintiff worked at the distribution center as a Distribution Center Person (sometimes referred to as a warehouse or dock clerk). (DSMF ¶ 12). Plaintiff directly reported to Donald ("Donnie") Henderson. (DSMF ¶ 13). Mr. Henderson's supervisor was Greg Claburn. (Id.). Both Mr. Henderson and Mr. Claburn reported to Joe Carroccia, the Distribution Center Manager. (Id.). Plaintiff's job was to collect orders and put them together for shipment, scanning the product to ensure that the orders were correct, building and shrink-wrapping pallets to load onto the trucks and sometimes loading and unloading the trucks. (DSMF ¶ 12). These tasks required Plaintiff to lift boxes that weighed between ten and seventy pounds. (DSMF ¶ 12).

A. Plaintiff was not Promoted to Maintenance Supervisor
A maintenance [*5]  supervisor position became available in the distribution center in approximately June or July 2006, and Plaintiff intended to apply for the position. (Deposition of Donald Anderson, hereinafter "Pl. Dep.," 191-93). Plaintiff states that Mr. Henderson told him that the only way he would be selected for the position was "to come through [him] and [he was] not going to recommend [him for] the job." (Pl. Dep. 192). Plaintiff claims that the denial of this promotion was discriminatory, but he admits that he "probably didn't" complain about it in his EEOC charge. (Pl. Dep. 191-92). Plaintiff does not know who was selected to fill the position. (Pl. Dep. 196-97).

B. Plaintiff Voices Concerns Because Defendant did not Acknowledge Good Attendance
Plaintiff alleges in his October 1, 2007 EEOC charge that Defendant retaliated against him for speaking out in a August 23, 2006 meeting. (Def. Ex. 8). Plaintiff testified that he spoke out at the meeting because he wanted to know why people with perfect attendance were not acknowledged by the company. (Pl. Dep. 59). Plaintiff did not speak out at the meeting about any other topic. (Pl. Dep. 59). Plaintiff claims that after he spoke out at the meeting, [*6]  Mr. Henderson said that he was going to make Plaintiff pay for opening his mouth in the meeting. (Pl. Dep. 205-07). When Plaintiff approached Mr. Claburn about Mr. Henderson's comment, Mr. Claburn said that he did not care if Plaintiff called corporate about it. (Pl. Dep. 205-07). Because another employee, who was also named Donald, expressed his concern about black employees not being promoted at the same meeting, Plaintiff speculates that Mr. Henderson and Mr. Claburn confused the other Donald with him. (Pl. Dep. 207). Mr. Carroccia was not in attendance at the meeting, and was unaware of any statements that Plaintiff made at the meeting until the instant lawsuit was filed. (DSMF ¶¶ 56-57; Declaration of Joe Carroccia, hereinafter "Carroccia Decl.," ¶¶ 15-16).

C. Plaintiff's Outside-the-Job Injury and Short-Term Disability Leave
On September 7, 2006, before Plaintiff went to work, he slipped and fell at Publix, resulting in a gash in his leg. (DSMF ¶ 16). Plaintiff tried to work for two or three days after his injury, but never returned to work. (Pl. Dep. 47). Thereafter, Plaintiff developed problems with his neck and his back (lumbar and cervical strains). (Pl. Dep. 111-12). Plaintiff [*7]  saw a series of physicians who indicated that Plaintiff could not return to work from September 2006 through May 2007, and intermittently thereafter until November 2007. (DSMF ¶¶ 22-27). Dr. Polledore, the orthopedist who was treating Plaintiff between September and December 2006, would not release him to return to work. (Pl. Dep. 78-79, 111-12).
According to Plaintiff, his back and neck improved by February 2007, but he was also having neurological problems (bowel difficulties) which did not improve until July 2007. (Pl. Dep. 153). During this period, Plaintiff begged his doctor, Dr. Kim, to release him to return to work, but Dr. Kim would not do so because he wanted Plaintiff to see a neurologist. (Pl. Dep. 151). Plaintiff was concerned during this period that it would be unsafe for him to drive a forklift because his prescription medication was affecting him, and he did not want to hurt anyone. (Pl. Dep. 152).
Plaintiff applied for and was approved for short-term disability leave, effective September 25, 2006. (DSMF ¶ 19; Pl. Dep. 47-48, 123; Ex. 15). Plaintiff understood at the time that because his short-term disability leave would last no longer than six months, he had to either [*8]  return to work or go on long-term disability. (Pl. Dep. 124). Plaintiff's short-term disability leave expired on March 22, 2007. (DSMF ¶ 30; Declaration of Deonna Sharp, hereinafter "Sharp Decl.," ¶ 9).

D. Plaintiff Requests Light Duty
1. Defendant's Light Duty Policy
When Defendant is provided a statement that an employee is unable to work with no specific restrictions on the employee's work abilities, Defendant does not allow the employee to return to work so as to avoid any further injury to the employee. (Carroccia Decl. ¶ 12). When Defendant receives notice of specific work restrictions for an employee, Defendant attempts to work with the employee to find a temporary light duty job that would allow the employee to work with his or her restrictions, provided the employee can still perform the essential functions of the job without risk of further injury. (Carroccia Decl. ¶ 13).
2. Plaintiff's Light Duty Request
Beginning on December 29, 2006, Plaintiff began calling the distribution center on a weekly basis to report his work status to Mr. Henderson. (DSMF ¶ 62). Plaintiff states that he requested an accommodation of light duty during those calls; meaning that he would like to drive [*9]  a forklift and unload trucks. (Pl. Dep. 48-49). Mr. Carroccia decided that Defendant could not provide light duty work for Plaintiff because as he "understood the information provided from [Plaintiff's] doctors, there were no limitations on his ability to work; rather, the doctor's notes simply stated that he was 'unable to work' or words to that effect." (Carroccia Decl. ¶ 14). Mr. Carroccia believed there was no way to provide a light duty job for an employee if the employee's doctor states that the employee is unable to work. (Carroccia Decl. ¶ 14). Because Plaintiff's doctor never specified any work restrictions and only indicated that Plaintiff was unable to work, Mr. Carroccia was unable to consider a light duty assignment for him. (Carroccia Decl. ¶¶ 13-14).
3. Plaintiff Names Other Employees who were Allegedly Allowed to Perform Light Duty
Plaintiff contends that other employees were given light duty. First, Plaintiff asserts that a guy named James, who was black and "probably about thirty-eight [years old]" was given light duty after he crashed his motorcycle. (Pl. Dep. 113-14). According to Plaintiff, James could not lift with his arm, so Defendant allowed him to sit at a desk [*10]  and drive a forklift. (Pl. Dep. 113-14). Plaintiff admits that he never saw James' return to work slips or paperwork showing his limitations. (Pl. Dep. 116). Plaintiff also contends that Eleanor Randle, a pregnant employee, was given light duty. (Pl. Dep. 115). Plaintiff believes that Ms. Randle was given light duty and the light duty position became her permanent job. (Pl. Dep. 117). According to Mr. Carroccia, Ms. Randle changed to a new permanent position while she was pregnant. (Carroccia Decl. ¶ 17). The new position was not a light duty position, however, but rather a permanent change to an open position. (Carroccia Decl. ¶ 17). Defendant has no record of Ms. Randle being on light duty. (Carroccia Decl. ¶ 17). Plaintiff also contends that an employee who did not work for almost a full year after undergoing a hip replacement "might have had some light duty." (Pl. Dep. 118). Plaintiff admits, however, that he does not know whether the employees' doctors' notes included any work restrictions. (Pl. Dep. 118).

E. Plaintiff's Termination
1. Plaintiff's Short-Term Disability Ended
On February 15, 2007, Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Kim, opined that Plaintiff could return to work on March [*11]  31, 2007. (Ex. 15, p. 15). Defendant scheduled Plaintiff to see Dr. Joseph Tatum for an independent medical examination. On March 12, 2007, Dr. Tatum reported that, in his opinion "from a physical, orthopedic aspect," Plaintiff could return to work. (Ex. 15, p. 16). At the end of March 2007, Dr. Kim revised his earlier date for Plaintiff's return to work and indicated that Plaintiff could return to work on April 22, 2007, or April 30, 2007, depending on Plaintiff's "ability to complete appointment with neurologist." (Ex. 15, pp. 21, 24).
Plaintiff's twenty-six weeks of short-term disability leave expired on March 22, 2007. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 9). Ordinarily, upon expiration of short-term disability leave, Defendant requires an employee to either return to work or go on long-term disability leave. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 11). If the employee does not elect either option, Defendant terminates the employee. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 11). At that time, both Dr. Tatum and Dr. Kim opined that Plaintiff could report to work at the end of March 2007. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 10; Ex. 15, pp 15-16, 21, 24).
On March 23, 2007, Embarq sent a letter to Mr. Anderson explaining that he must have his health care provider complete and [*12]  submit a Health Care Provider Extension Form if he was unable to return to work. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 10). Plaintiff explained the circumstances relating his need to see a neurologist to Deonna Sharp, who had just begun handling disability benefits in early March 2007. (Sharp Decl. ¶¶ 4, 8). Because Ms. Sharp was new in her position, she did not apply the policy requiring an employee exceeding his six-month disability leave to either be placed on long-term disability leave or be terminated. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 11). Instead, Ms. Sharp mistakenly asked Plaintiff to provide her with documentation from his medical care provider indicating that he would be able to return within thirty days and placed Mr. Anderson on unpaid short-term disability status for another month to allow him to see the neurologist and return to work in April 2007. (Sharp Decl. ¶¶ 11, 15). Plaintiff's health insurance coverage lapsed, and Plaintiff did not see the neurologist. (DSMF ¶ 36).
Plaintiff faxed his application for long-term disability benefits to Ms. Sharp on April 23, 2007. (DSMF ¶ 40; Ex. 17). Long-term disability coverage becomes available after an employee has exhausted all of his short-term disability benefits. [*13]  (Sharp Decl. ¶ 13). Determinations of eligibility for long-term disability coverage are made by the insurance company. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 13). On July 5, 2007, the insurance company denied Plaintiff's long-term disability benefits application, claiming that Plaintiff failed to respond to their requests for information. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 19; Ex. 18-19; Pl. Dep. 168-69).
2. Ms. Booth Terminates Plaintiff After he Fails to Return to Work After the end of the One-Month Unpaid Short-Term Leave
At the end of April or early May 2007, Ms. Sharp informed her supervisor, Jenny Booth, that Plaintiff's six-month short-term disability leave period and the one month extension Ms. Sharp had granted Plaintiff had both expired. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 15). Ms. Sharp further informed Ms. Booth that Dr. Tatum had indicated that Plaintiff could return to work and that she had not received any update from Dr. Kim after he had issued the report indicating Plaintiff could return to work on April 30, 2007. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 15). Upon reviewing Dr. Tatum's report and Dr. Kim's report, Ms. Booth determined that Plaintiff remained off work even when both physicians opined that he could work. (Declaration of Jenny Booth, hereinafter [*14]  "Booth Decl." ¶ 14). Ms. Booth further concluded that Plaintiff did not intend to return to work because he had applied for long-term disability benefits. (Booth Decl. ¶ 14). As a result, Ms. Booth decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment. (Booth Decl. ¶ 15).
On May 4, 2007, Ms. Sharp called Plaintiff to advise him that she had not received any updated reports from his doctor extending his time off work. (Pl. Dep. 138-39, 142; Sharp Decl. ¶ 16). In response, Plaintiff faxed Ms. Sharp a March 26, 2007 report that she previously received advising that Plaintiff was off work until April 30, 2007. (Sharp Decl. ¶ 16; Pl. Dep. 142-44; Ex. 15, pp. 23-24). Ms. Sharp phoned Plaintiff again to tell him that he had faxed the same doctor's report she had previously received, and on May 7, 2007, Plaintiff responded by sending her a new doctor's report indicating that he should remain out of work until May 24, 2007. (Pl. Dep. 145-46; Ex. 15, pp. 15-16, 25-26; Sharp Decl. ¶ 17). Plaintiff claims that he had previously sent this report. (Pl. Dep. 146).
At the time Ms. Booth made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment, she had not seen the doctor's report indicating that Plaintiff could [*15]  not return to work until May 24, 2007. (Booth Decl. ¶ 16). Ms. Booth stated that even if she had seen the report, she would not have extended Plaintiff's leave because he had been off work since September 2006. (Booth Decl. ¶ 16). Ms. Booth was also unaware of any internal complaints that Plaintiff may have made. (Booth Decl. ¶ 20).
Plaintiff believes an "older guy, about 50 some years old, black guy" who possibly had a hip replacement was allowed to keep his position after being out on short-term disability for longer than six months. (Pl. Dep. 173). Plaintiff thinks that the employee was out of work for "almost seven, eight months, maybe nine, ten months, almost a whole year." (Pl. Dep. 173).
3. Ms. Sharp Informs Plaintiff of his Termination
Plaintiff claims that Ms. Sharp informed him of his termination on May 7, 2007. According to Plaintiff, during that conversation, Ms. Sharp told Plaintiff that she had talked with "Joe Corolla,2 Greg and Donny" and they said that "Plaintiff was fifty-one and had a bad back." (Pl. Dep. p. 148-57). Ms. Sharp also allegedly told Plaintiff that Mr. Carroccia, Mr. Claburn, and Mr. Henderson did not want him to come back to work. (Pl. Dep. 148-57). Although [*16]  Mr. Carroccia did advise Ms. Booth that the distribution center was not in a position to continue Plaintiff's unpaid leave after the expiration of Plaintiff's short-term disability leave, neither Mr. Carroccia nor any other management employee at the distribution center had any involvement in the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment. (Booth Decl. ¶ 17). Plaintiff does not know who the company hired to replace him. (Pl. Dep. 170).

F. Plaintiff Files Charges of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
Plaintiff filed his first EEOC charge on May 10, 2007. (Pl. Dep., Ex. 1). Therein, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his age and his disability when Defendant denied his request for light duty and terminated him. On October 1, 2007, Plaintiff filed a second charge of discrimination alleging that he was harassed, denied a reasonable accommodation and terminated on May 7, 2007, because of his race and in retaliation for asking during a meeting why people with perfect attendance are not acknowledged.

II. LEGAL ANALYSIS

A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure [*17]  materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The movant bears the initial responsibility of asserting the basis for her motion. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Apcoa, Inc. v. Fid. Nat'l Bank, 906 F.2d 610, 611 (11th Cir. 1990). The movant is not required, however, to negate her opponent's claim; the movant may discharge her burden by merely "'showing'-that is, pointing out to the district court-that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. After the movant has carried her burden, the non-moving party is then required to "go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial"; the non-moving party may meet its burden through affidavit and deposition testimony, answers to interrogatories, and the like. Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).
While the court is to view all evidence and factual inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n v. Norton, 324 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir. 2003), "the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (emphasis [*18]  in original). A fact is material when it is identified as such by the controlling substantive law. Id. at 248. Moreover, the non-movant "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts . . . . Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citations omitted). An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50. Thus, the Federal Rules mandate the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of every element essential to that party's case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.

B. Plaintiff's Promotion Claims
Plaintiff contends that the failure to promote him to a maintenance supervisor position in approximately June or July 2006 was discriminatory. It is not clear from Plaintiff's complaint whether he is contending that Defendant's refusal to promote him was discriminatory on the basis of his race, age, disability or retaliatory. Defendant contends that because the [*19]  promotion claim was outside the scope of Plaintiff's EEOC charges, Plaintiff's promotion claim fails.
Defendant is correct. Before filing suit under the Title VII, the ADA, or the ADEA, a plaintiff must exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a charge with the EEOC. 19 U.S.C. 626(d)(1) (providing charge of discrimination must be filed within 180 days after the alleged unlawful practice); 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a) (applying remedies and procedures of Title VII to ADA); Butler v. Greif, Inc., 325 Fed. Appx. 748, 2009 WL 928916, at *1 (11th Cir. 2009) (must exhaust remedies before filing charge of discrimination under ADA); Gregory v. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources, 355 F.3d 1277, 1279 (11th Cir. 2004); McBrayer v. City of Marietta, 967 F.2d 546, 547 (11th Cir. 1992) (filing of timely charge of discrimination prerequisite under the ADEA). The Plaintiff's judicial complaint is limited by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination. Alexander v. Fulton County, 207 F.3d 1303, 1332 (11th Cir. 2000). Although new acts of discrimination not raised in the charge are not appropriate for judicial review, the scope of the EEOC charge should not be strictly interpreted. Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280. "[C]laims are allowed if they 'amplify, clarify, or more clearly focus' the allegations in the EEOC complaint." Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1279-80.
In this case, Plaintiff admits that he "probably didn't" complain about the Defendant's refusal to promote him to the maintenance supervisor position in his EEOC charge. [*20]  (Pl. Dep. 191-92). Moreover, a review of Plaintiff's EEOC charges reveals that he was only complaining about Defendant's refusal of his request for a reasonable accommodation, his termination, and alleged retaliatory harassment; they do not mention a denied promotion. (Pl. Dep. 191-92, Ex. 6, 8). Plaintiff's promotion claim is an entirely separate event and does not amplify, clarify, or more clearly focus the allegations within Plaintiff's EEOC charge. Indeed, Plaintiff's promotion claim significantly predates the events enumerated within his charge. According to Plaintiff, the maintenance supervisor position became available in June or July 2006. Each of the events within Plaintiff's EEOC charge occurred after August 23, 2006, when Plaintiff allegedly "spoke out" because the company did not have a policy of acknowledging employees with perfect attendance. Plaintiff was not terminated until May 7, 2007, and was denied light duty starting at the earliest in December 2006. Therefore, this Court cannot conclude that the EEOC's investigation of Plaintiff's charge would have reasonably included his promotion claim. Stuart v. Jefferson County Dep't of Human Resources,152 F.App'x 798, 801 (11th Cir. 2006) (granting summary judgment as to promotion claim because it was outside [*21]  scope of EEOC charge which only referenced other promotion claims); Ramon v. AT&T Broadband, 195 F.App'x 860, 864 (11th Cir. 2006) (hostile work environment claim outside scope of EEOC charge complaining about loss of bilingual pay). Accordingly, summary judgment should be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claims concerning Defendant's failure to promote him to the maintenance supervisor position.

C. Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff claims that starting on December 29, 2006, he repeatedly requested light duty as an accommodation for his back and neck problems, and Defendant repeatedly refused his requests. (Compl. ¶ 8). Plaintiff contends that Defendant's refusal of his requested accommodation was discriminatory on the basis of his disability. Plaintiff also appears to contend that his termination was discriminatory on the basis of his disability.3
1. Plaintiff's Reasonable Accommodation Claim
Plaintiff requested that Defendant assign him to light duty as an accommodation for his back and neck problems and that Defendant allow him to work near a restroom as an accommodation for a neurological condition that prevented him from controlling his bowels. (Pl. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 60; Pl. Dep. 49, 151-53). Defendant contends that Plaintiff's reasonable [*22]  accommodation claim fails because Plaintiff's requested accommodation eliminated essential functions of his position, therefore, it was not reasonable. Defendant further contends that Plaintiff was not qualified for the position because he was not able to perform the essential functions of his position with or without an accommodation.
The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating based upon the known physical or mental impairments of a qualified individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112. An employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a qualified employee's disability violates the Act, unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Lucas v. W. W. Granger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2001). Under the ADA, the term "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities" 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56.
The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job rests with that individual, [*23]  as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to demonstrating that such an accommodation is reasonable. Willis v. Conopco, 108 F.3d 282, 283 (11th Cir. 1997). "An employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which that employee desires." Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 947 (N.D. Ga. 1995); Vande Zande v. State of Wis. Dept. of Admin., 851 F. Supp. 353, 360 (W.D. Wis. 1994) ("an employee is entitled only to a reasonable accommodation and not to [a] preferred accommodation"), aff'd, 44 F.3d 538 (7th Cir. 1995). An accommodation is "reasonable" and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. Holly v. Claison Indus., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007); Lucas v. W.W. Granger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii) ("The term reasonable accommodation means: . . . modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position"). "If the individual is unable to perform an essential function of his job, even with an accommodation, he is, by definition, not a 'qualified individual' and, therefore, not covered under the ADA." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256. In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256. The employee must actually perform the functions the employer asserts are essential.  [*24] Id. On the other hand, "the ADA may require an employer to restructure a particular job by altering or eliminating some of its marginal functions." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256; LaChance v. Duffy's Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1988) ("The ADA defines 'essential functions' to be the fundamental job duties of the employment position, as differentiated from 'marginal' functions.).
Essential functions are the fundamental duties of a position; in determining whether a job function is essential, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment, but it is not the exclusive factor. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1253; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1265. If an employer has prepared a written job description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job. 42 U.S.C. § 12111; D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1230 (11th Cir. 2005). Other factors include (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function, (3) the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of past incumbents in the job, (5) the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs, (6) whether the reason the position exists is to perform the function; (7) whether there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance [*25]  of the job function can be distributed; and (8) whether the function is so highly specialized that the incumbent in the position was hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1258.

a. Plaintiff's Requested Accommodation was Unreasonable because it Eliminated Essential Functions of the Position
In this case, Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim fails because the undisputed facts establish that Plaintiff's requested accommodation eliminated essential functions of his position. Therefore, the requested accommodation was not reasonable. Joseph Carroccia, the Manager of the distribution center where Plaintiff worked, states that Plaintiff's job duties included collecting orders and putting them together for shipment, scanning the product to ensure that the orders were correct, building and shrink wrapping pallets to load onto the trucks and sometimes unloading trucks. (Carroccia Decl. ¶ 6). In this capacity, Plaintiff was required to lift boxes weighing between ten and seventy pounds on a regular basis to build pallets which would be transported onto delivery trucks by forklifts. (Carroccia Decl. ¶ 6; Pl. Dep. pp. 100-01). According to the job description [*26]  for the position, Plaintiff was "frequently and continually" required to pick, sort, lift and move material and bid pallets weighing between zero and seventy pounds. The job description further noted that job duties that were delineated as "frequently and continual" were performed between 34% and 100% of the employee's time. (Carroccia Decl., Ex. 2). Plaintiff does not dispute that these were his job duties or that these were essential job duties. (DSMF ¶ 12; see generally, Plaintiff's Response to DSMF).
Instead of performing his essential job duties, Plaintiff requested that he be assigned light duty as an accommodation. Plaintiff defines light duty as reducing his job duties to driving a forklift and unloading a truck.4 (Pl. Dep. 49). In essence, Plaintiff did not request an accommodation that would have allowed him to perform the essential functions of the job, but rather, he requested an accommodation which would allow him to perform another job that did not require the physical aspects of his job. "While it is true that the ADA may require an employer to restructure a particular job by altering or eliminating some of the marginal functions, employers are not required to transform [*27]  the position into another one by eliminating functions that are essential to the nature of the job as it exists." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260. In this case, the more physical tasks Plaintiff would like to jettison from his job duties constitute, at a minimum, 34% of his work load. Defendant is not required to create a new position with these specifications, and Plaintiff does not allege that he was qualified for any open positions with these specifications during the period he was out on disability leave. Knight v. Computer Sciences Raytheon, No. 6:00CV1563ORL28DAB, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27928, 2002 WL 32818520, at *12 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 25, 2002) (holding that the post office was not required to eliminate heavy lifting job duties indefinitely as an accommodation because heavy lifting was an essential function of the job); Pickering v. City of Atlanta, 75 F. Supp. 2d 1374, 1379 (N.D. Ga. 1999), aff'd 235 F.3d 1344 (11th Cir. 2000) (light duty assignment not required as accommodation because ADA does not require an employer to create such position by job restructuring to eliminate essential functions of the job).
This is not a case where the Plaintiff only needed a brief period of light duty to rehabilitate before returning to regular duties. Here, Plaintiff's doctors indicated that Plaintiff was unable to work starting from the immediate week after his injury in September 2006, extending [*28]  through May 2007, and then periods of time in August through late November 2007. (Ex. 15, pp. 1, 2, 4, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22, 27; Pl. Dep. 27). The ADA does not require that an employer allow an employee to remain out of work or to perform light duty indefinitely as part of an accommodation. Byrne v. Avon Products, Inc., 328 F.3d 379, 381 (7th Cir. 2003) (inability to work for a multi-month period removes a person from the class protected by the ADA); Boothe v. Henderson, 31 F. Supp. 2d 988, 995 (S.D. Ga. 1998) (employee who requires indefinite medical leave not qualified under ADA); cf Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222, 1225 (11th Cir. 1997) (plaintiff who had not been released to work at the time he was terminated was not qualified).

b. Plaintiff Fails to Show that he could Perform his Position even with his Desired Accommodation
Moreover, Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of raising a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his requested accommodation would allow him to perform his position. In this case, Plaintiff states that he began requesting light duty on December 29, 2006. (Pl. Dep. 48-49). Plaintiff's physicians, however, indicated that Plaintiff should be released from working altogether from December 2006 until after his termination. (Ex. 15, pp. 10, 12, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22, 27). The first time that any of Plaintiff's physicians specified [*29]  any conditions under which Plaintiff could work occurred on August 28, 2007, well after Plaintiff's termination. (Ex. 15, p. 27).
The result is not changed by the fact that Dr. Tatum, Defendant's independent medical examiner, concluded that from an orthopedic standpoint, Plaintiff could have returned to work in mid-March 2007. Because Dr. Tatum qualified his release by noting that Plaintiff was capable of returning to full duty "from a physical orthopedic aspect," Dr. Tatum did not address Plaintiff's neurological condition and whether it precluded his ability to work. (Ex. 15, p. 16). This is significant because Plaintiff admits that after he had a neurological episode in Dr. Tatum's office, Dr. Tatum told him that he needed to see a neurologist. (Pl. Dep. 126-33). Additionally, even though Plaintiff begged Dr. Kim, Plaintiff's own physician, to release him to work light duty, Dr. Kim refused because he believed Plaintiff needed to be examined by a neurologist. (Pl. Dep. 151). Plaintiff never did see the neurologist. (Pl. Dep. 198-99). Given the qualification within Dr. Tatum's release and the fact that the Plaintiff also had a neurological condition which affected his ability to work, [*30]  the release from Dr. Tatum is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of his position in March 2007.
Plaintiff maintains that even though his doctor did not release him to work and Defendant would not allow him to return to work, he has always communicated his desire to return to work. Consistent with his doctors' testimony, however, Plaintiff does not present any facts tending to show that he was able to safely and effectively perform his job before his termination in May of 2007. Indeed, Plaintiff testified in his deposition that his back had not sufficiently improved to allow his return to work until February 2007 and that he continued to have a neurological condition affecting control of his bowels and his ability to keep food down until July 2007. (Pl. Dep. 152-53). Plaintiff testified that as a result, he "started taking . . . the pink stuff, Pepto-Bismol, taking the little pills" the doctor gave him and "started praying to God, 'please, man, I can't live like this. I got to go to work, you know.'" (Pl. Dep. 153-54). Plaintiff also speculated that although he believed at some point5 that he could "do [*31]  lifting and still be able to deal with the pain," he was concerned that he would be impaired by his prescribed pain medication. (Pl. Dep. 152). Plaintiff feared that driving the forklift while under the influence of the pain medication could cause injury to himself or others. (Pl. Dep. 152). Plaintiff suggests that he should have taken over-the-counter medication so he could return to work, but he does not give an opinion as to whether or not the over-the-counter medication would have been sufficient to allow him to safely or effectively perform his duties. (Pl. Dep. 152-53). Given that Plaintiff's doctors would not release him to return to work, Plaintiff does not present evidence tending to show that he could safely perform his job duties, and Plaintiff was concerned that his pain medication would interfere with his ability to drive a fork lift (Plaintiff's requested accommodation), this Court cannot find that a reasonable accommodation would have allowed Plaintiff to perform the essential duties of his job. Ferguson v. Texasgulf, Inc., No. H-94-0710, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21922, 1996 WL 454987, at *11 (S.D. Tex. 1996) (finding that employee whose physician had not released him to return to work was not qualified to perform essential functions of the position), aff'd 106 F.3d 397 (5th Cir. 1997).
2. Plaintiff's Termination [*32]  Claim
Plaintiff's claim that Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his disability when he was terminated also fails because Plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was qualified to perform his essential job duties at the time of his termination. To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory termination under the ADA, Plaintiff must show: (1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified individual able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without accommodation; and (3) he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1255-56; D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1226. In order to make out the second prong of his prima facie case, Plaintiff must prove that he is a "qualified individual," that is, someone with a disability who, "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); Holly, 492 F.3d 1247; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, . . . that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12111; Holly, 492 F.3d 1247.
Plaintiff has failed to put forward [*33]  any evidence tending to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he could perform his essential job duties at the time of his termination. As of the date of Plaintiff's termination, May 7, 2007, Plaintiff's physician still did not release him to return to work. Plaintiff's medical evaluations indicated that he was unable to work from September 11, 2006 through May 24, 2007, and several periods of time thereafter. (Ex. 15, p. 22, 27, Pl. Dep. 121-22). Plaintiff's verification of medical treatment of March 24, 2007, just prior to his termination, indicates that he would need to be excused from work for medical reasons from March 22, 2007 to April 30, 2007. (Ex. 15, p. 21). The verification provides, however, that Plaintiff may resume work "depending on ability to complete appointment with neurologist." (Ex. 15, p. 21). In Plaintiff's next verification of medical treatment, dated April 24, 2007, Plaintiff's doctor states that Plaintiff would tentatively resume work on May 24, 2007, "depending on the results of his evaluation over the next four weeks." (Ex. 15, p. 26). Thus, neither evaluation indicates that Plaintiff has overcome his neurological and/or other issues that were [*34]  precluding his ability to work. Plaintiff's doctor saw Plaintiff again on August 28, 2007, and still indicated that Plaintiff was unable to return to work between August 28, 2007, and September 30, 2007. (Ex. 15, p. 27). Five months after Plaintiff's termination, Plaintiff's doctor finally indicated that he could return to work on October 1, 2007. (Ex. 15, p. 27). At that time, Plaintiff's doctor restricted Plaintiff to "[l]ight duty with limited lifting below 10 pounds and also no frequent lifting." (Ex. 15, p. 27). Plaintiff would not have been able to perform the essential job functions of his position under these restrictions because Plaintiff's job required him to lift boxes weighing between ten and seventy pounds on a frequent or continuous basis, meaning between 34 and 100% of the time. (Carroccia ¶ 6, Ex 2).

D. Plaintiff's Race Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff also contends that Defendant's refusal of his request for light duty and his termination were discriminatory on the basis of his race in violation of Title VII. Defendant contends that both fail because Plaintiff cannot raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was qualified for his position or whether similarly [*35]  situated employees outside his protected class were treated more favorably. Defendant further contends that Plaintiff's termination claim fails because he cannot show that he was replaced by someone from outside of his protected class and because he cannot show that Defendant's nondiscriminatory reason for his termination was pretextual.
Plaintiff's inability to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was qualified for his position or whether other similarly situated employees were treated more favorably is fatal to his race discrimination claims. Because Plaintiff has failed to present evidence of a pattern or practice of discrimination or direct evidence of race discrimination, he must prove discrimination through circumstantial evidence, thus invoking the McDonnell Douglas/Burdine burden-shifting analysis. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1561-62 (11th Cir. 1997). Under the McDonnell Douglas/Burdine framework, the plaintiff first has the burden of establishing a prima facie case. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). If the plaintiff meets his burden, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254; Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc). This burden is one of production, not persuasion, and is [*36]  "exceedingly light." Turnes v. AmSouth Bank, N.A., 36 F.3d 1057, 1061 (11th Cir. 1994); Perryman v. Johnson Prod. Co., 698 F.2d 1138, 1141 (11th Cir. 1983). The plaintiff will then be given an opportunity to show that the defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reason was merely a pretext for discriminatory intent. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253; Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1024.
1. Plaintiff's Light Duty Claim
Plaintiff's claim that Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his race when it failed to assign him to light duty tasks fails because Plaintiff cannot establish his prima facie case of discrimination. In order to establish disparate treatment discrimination based on circumstantial evidence under Title VII, Plaintiff must show that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; (3) he was qualified for the job; and (4) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside of his protected class more favorably or other sufficient evidence to infer a nexus or causal connection between Plaintiff's protected status and disparate treatment. Morris v. Emory Clinic, Inc., 402 F.3d 1076, 1082 (11th Cir. 2005); Knight v. Baptist Hosp. of Miami, Inc., 330 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted); Kelliher v. Veneman, 313 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002) (citations omitted).

a. Plaintiff has not Established his Prima Facie Case because he has not Presented Evidence that he was Qualified to Perform his Position or that Similarly Situated Employees from Outside his Protected Class were Treated More Favorably [*37] 
Plaintiff cannot establish his prima facie case of race discrimination with respect to his light duty claim because Plaintiff cannot show that he was qualified for his position or that similarly situated people were treated more favorably. To prove that he was qualified, Plaintiff need only show that he met the minimum qualifications of the job. Carter v. Three Springs Residential Treatment, 132 F.3d 635, 642 (11th Cir. 1998); see also Lane v. Ogden Entertainment, Inc., 13 F.Supp.2d 1261, 1275 (M.D. Ala. 1998) ("Consistent with long-standing precedent that plaintiff's prima facie burden is not an onerous one, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the [qualification] element of the prima facie case-that plaintiff be qualified for the position-means that plaintiff satisfies the minimum qualifications of the job."). As discussed above, Plaintiff was no longer qualified for his position. Plaintiff's position not only required regular lifting, but also required driving a forklift. Plaintiff could not perform either of these functions. Plaintiff also failed to present evidence showing that Plaintiff could perform his duties even if he was assigned to light duty. Because Plaintiff was no longer qualified to perform his position, Plaintiff cannot establish his prima facie case.
Furthermore, Plaintiff is unable to establish his prima facie case because [*38]  he cannot show that other similarly situated employees from outside his protected class were assigned to light duty. To be an appropriate comparator, the employee must be "similarly situated in all aspects." Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1563. "The comparator must be nearly identical to the plaintiff to prevent courts from second-guessing a reasonable decision by the employer." Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1091 (11th Cir. 2004).
Plaintiff fails to identify any similarly situated employees. Plaintiff testified in his deposition that he recalls three other employees who were given light duty. First, Plaintiff asserts that a guy named James, who was Black and "probably about thirty-eight [years old]" was given light duty after he crashed his motorcycle. (Pl. Dep. pp. 113-14). Second, Plaintiff also contends that Eleanor Randle, a pregnant employee, was given light duty, and the light duty position became her permanent job. (Pl. Dep. 115-17). Finally, Plaintiff contends that an employee who did not work for almost a full year after undergoing a hip replacement "might have had some light duty." (Pl. Dep. 118). Not only are some of these employees within Plaintiff's protected class, but also the facts as alleged do not show that these employees are similarly situated because [*39]  there is no evidence showing the circumstances under which these employees could work or whether their doctor released them to work. According to Mr. Carroccia, he could not assign Plaintiff to light duty because Plaintiff's physician did not release Plaintiff to work at all and company policy does not permit employees who have not been released from their doctor to return to work. (Carroccia Decl. ¶¶ 8-14). Plaintiff admits that he does not know whether his alleged comparators were released by their doctors to return to work. (Pl. Dep. 116-18). Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether similarly situated employees were treated more favorably. Plaintiff also fails to present any other evidence tending to show a race-based discriminatory motive. Because Plaintiff has failed to establish his prima facie case, summary judgment should be granted as to Plaintiff's light duty claim. White v. Dep't of Transp., 292 F.App'x 765, 769 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding that because the plaintiff failed to establish that he was qualified for the promotion, the issues of whether or not similarly situated people were treated more favorably and whether the nondiscriminatory reason was pretextual were moot).

b. Plaintiff Fails [*40]  to Show that Defendant's Nondiscriminatory Reason for Denying his Request for Light Duty was Pretextual
Moreover, even if Plaintiff could establish his prima facie case, he has failed to show that Defendant's nondiscriminatory reason for not assigning him to light duty was pretextual. When pretext is an issue, the question the district court must answer is whether the employer's proffered reasons were "a coverup for a . . . discriminatory decision." Rojas v. Florida, 285 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir. 2002). In doing so, the district court must evaluate whether the plaintiff has demonstrated "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997). In this case, Mr. Carroccia indicated that he did not assign Plaintiff to light work because Plaintiff's physician did not release Plaintiff to work and company policy does not permit employees who have been out of work because of an injury to return to work when they have not been released by their doctor. Plaintiff presents no evidence tending to show that this explanation is false. Accordingly, summary judgment should be GRANTED as to [*41]  Plaintiff's claim that the Defendant's failure to assign him to light duty was discriminatory on the basis of his race.
2. Plaintiff's Discriminatory Termination Claim
Plaintiff also cannot establish his prima facie case of discriminatory termination. To establish his prima facie case, Plaintiff must show that (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he was qualified to do the job; (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action; and (4) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside his class more favorably or he was replaced by a person from outside his protected class. Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir. 2008); Howard v. Oregon Television, Inc., 276 F.App'x 940, 942 (11th Cir. 2008); Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Div. of Univ. of Fla. Dep't of Educ. Ex rel. Univ. of South Fla., 342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir. 2003).
Plaintiff's termination claim fails because he cannot establish his prima facie case. First, given that Plaintiff does not know who replaced him after his termination, Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant replaced him with someone from outside of his protected class. (Pl. Dep. 170). Additionally, Plaintiff failed to present evidence that similarly situated employees from outside of his protected class were treated more favorably. The only employee who Plaintiff recalls was permitted to take as much leave or more than Plaintiff [*42]  without being terminated was an employee who possibly had a hip replacement and remained out on short-term disability leave for longer than six months. (Pl. Dep. 173). According to Plaintiff, however, the employee was an "older guy, about 50 some years old, black guy." (Pl. Dep. 173). Thus, both Plaintiff and his comparator were from the same protected racial class, and therefore, this evidence does not advance Plaintiff's race discrimination claim. When evidence of similarly situated employees is unavailable, the plaintiff is required to produce other circumstantial evidence of discrimination. Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1562; see also Smellie v. Florida Dep't of Corr., 324 Fed. Appx. 783, 2009 WL 1101364, at *2 (11th Cir. 2009). Plaintiff presents no other circumstantial evidence of race discrimination. Because Plaintiff cannot establish his prima facie case of discrimination, the Court need not analyze whether Defendant's nondiscriminatory reason for terminating him is pretextual. Maynard, 342 F.3d at 1289. Therefore, summary judgment should be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's race discrimination claims because Plaintiff cannot establish his prima facie case.

E. Plaintiff's Age Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant's denial of his request for light duty and its decision to terminate him were discriminatory on the [*43]  basis of his age. The ADEA prevents age discrimination in employment. Because Plaintiff has presented no direct evidence of age discrimination, Plaintiff must follow the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework for circumstantial evidence cases. Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1024 (applying the McDonnell Douglas framework to circumstantial evidence in an ADEA case). Direct evidence of discrimination is evidence which reflects "a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude correlating to the discrimination or retaliation complained of by the employee." Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Florida, Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1358-59 (11th Cir. 1999). In other words, the evidence must indicate that the complained-of employment decision was motivated by the decision-maker's ageism without inference or presumption. Id.; Schoenfeld v. Babbitt, 168 F.3d 1257, 1266 (11th Cir. 1999); Malu v. City of Gainesville, 270 F.App'x 945, 948 (11th Cir. 2008). As a result, "only the most blatant remarks, whose intent could be nothing other than to discriminate on the basis of age" will constitute direct evidence of discrimination. Id.; Earley v. Champion Int'l Corp., 907 F.2d 1077, 1081-82 (11th Cir. 1990); Carter v. City of Miami, 870 F.2d 578, 582 (11th Cir. 1989). An example of "direct evidence would be a management memorandum saying, 'Fire Earley-he is too old.'" Earley, 907 F.2d at 1082. Remarks by non-decisionmakers or remarks unrelated to the decisionmaking process itself are not direct evidence of discrimination. Malu, 270 F.App'x at 948 (citing Bass v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, Orange County, FL, 256 F.3d 1095, 1105 (11th Cir. 2001). In this case, Defendant points out that Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Sharp, [*44]  when advising him that he was terminated, told him that "she talked to John and Joe and they said you [sic] 51 years old with a bad back" and "Joe and Greg and Donny . . . didn't want [him] back in the plant anymore, and they moved on and hired somebody else for the position." (Pl. Dep. 147, 156-57). However, Ms. Sharp's alleged statements are not direct evidence because she was not the final decision maker. Ms. Sharp did not make the decision to not give Plaintiff light duty or to terminate Plaintiff. (Booth Decl. ¶¶ 15, 17, 20; Sharp Decl. ¶¶ 14-15); see, e.g., Brown v. Northside Hosp., 311 F.App'x 217, 222 (11th Cir. 2009); Malu, 270 F.App'x at 948. In Defendant's Statement of Material Facts as to Which There Exists no Genuine Issue to be Tried, Defendant states that Ms. Booth made the decision to terminate Plaintiff, and Plaintiff has not disputed this fact. (See DSMF ¶ 42; Pl. Response, ¶ 42).
1. Plaintiff's Light Duty Claim
Therefore, in order to establish that Defendant's denial of light duty was discriminatory on the basis of his age, Plaintiff must show that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; (3) his employer treated similarly-situated employees outside of his protected class more favorably; and (4) he [*45]  was qualified for the job, or other sufficient evidence to infer a nexus or causal connection between Plaintiff's protected status and disparate treatment. Morris, 402 F.3d at 1082; Knight, 330 F.3d at 1316; Kelliher, 313 F.3d at 1275.
As discussed above, Plaintiff cannot establish his prima facie case because he has not shown that similarly situated employees were treated more favorably or that he was qualified for the position. In addition, Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence of a causal connection between his age and the denial of light duty. The closest Plaintiff comes is his testimony that at the time of his termination, Ms. Sharp told him that she "talked to John and Joe and they said you [sic] 51 years old with a bad back" and that "Joe and Greg and Donny . . . didn't want [him] back in the plant anymore, and they moved on and hired somebody else for the position." These remarks by themselves are not enough to show age-based animus in connection with the decision to deny light duty because they were made many months after the denial of light duty and were unrelated to the decision to deny light duty. Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 190 F.App'x 924, 925-26 (11th Cir. 2006), cert denied 549 U.S. 1181 (2007). Moreover, the comments are too ambiguous and attenuated to have probative weight. The statement discusses an alleged conversation [*46]  between John, Greg, Joe6 and Ms. Sharp. Plaintiff asserts that Ms. Sharp said that "they" or "Joe and all them" said that Plaintiff was fifty-one with a bad back, but does not attribute what portions of the conversation were stated by Joe Carroccia, the actual decisionmaker with respect to the decision to deny Plaintiff light duty. (Pl. Dep. 147, 156-57). Based on Plaintiff's assertions, the factfinder cannot know which of the four participants in the alleged conversation made the alleged comment about Plaintiff's age. (Pl. Dep. 147, 156-57). Thus, rank speculation is required to conclude that Mr. Carroccia harbored age-based animus and more than speculation is required to raise a genuine issue of material fact withstanding summary judgment. Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1180 (11th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, because Plaintiff cannot establish his prima facie case and because Plaintiff has presented no evidence that Defendant's nondiscriminatory reason for denying him light duty is pretextual, summary judgment should be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's light duty claim.
2. Plaintiff's Termination Claim
To establish a prima facie case under the ADEA, a plaintiff must show that; (1) he was a member of the protected class; (2) he was subject to an [*47]  adverse employment action; (3) a substantially younger person filled the position from which he was discharged; and (4) he was qualified to do the job for which he was rejected. Damon, 196 F.3d at 1359. Defendant correctly contends that Plaintiff cannot establish his prima facie case because he cannot show that he was qualified for his position at the time he was terminated or that he was replaced by a substantially younger person. As discussed above, Plaintiff has not shown that he was qualified because there was no evidence that Plaintiff was capable of performing his duties, and Plaintiff has not shown that he was replaced by someone from outside of his protected class because he does not know who replaced him.
Moreover, Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence of a causal connection between his age and his termination. Defendant points out that Plaintiff's only testimony alleging age-based statements by anyone is Ms. Sharp's alleged statement that Plaintiff's managers remarked that Plaintiff was fifty-one and had a bad back. (Pl. Dep. 147, 170). Ms. Sharp's statement, however, is not probative of Plaintiff's termination claim because the undisputed evidence in this case is that Ms. Booth and [*48]  not Mr. Carroccia or Ms. Sharp, made the decision to terminate Plaintiff. Although Plaintiff testified in his deposition that Ms. Sharp told him that Joe, Greg and Donny decided that they did not want him in the plant anymore and moved on and hired someone else for the position, Plaintiff does not respond in opposition to paragraph forty-two of Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts wherein Defendant states that Ms. Booth made the decision to terminate Plaintiff. (Pl. Dep. 147, 157; DSMF ¶ 42). This Court must accept as admitted those facts in the moving party's statement that have not been specifically controverted with citation to the relevant portions of the record by the opposing party. LR 56.1B.2(2), (3), NDGa.
Moreover, this is not a case in which the cat's paw theory would apply to show that Mr. Carroccia, who, under Plaintiff's rendition of the facts, may have commented to Ms. Sharp about Plaintiff being fifty-one and having a bad back, influenced Ms. Booth's decision to terminate Plaintiff. The cat's paw theory provides that causation may be established if the plaintiff shows that the decisionmaker followed a biased recommendation without independently investigating the biased [*49]  recommender's basis for requesting the adverse action. See Malu, 270 F.App'x at 948-49; Stimpson v. City of Tuscaloosa, 186 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir. 1999). In such a case, the recommender is using the decisionmaker as a mere conduit, or "cat's paw" to give effect to the recommender's discriminatory animus. Malu, 270 F.App'x at 948-49; Stimpson, 186 F.3d at 1332. In this case, however, it is undisputed that Ms. Booth made the decision to terminate Plaintiff based on her review of Plaintiff's file, documents pertaining to his disability leave status, reports from Plaintiff's physician, and Plaintiff's applications for leave. (Booth Decl. ¶¶ 13-17; DSMF ¶ 48). Although Plaintiff notes, without evidentiary support in his response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts, that Ms. Sharp had discussed his termination with Joe Carroccia and Greg Claburn, Plaintiff does not provide any evidence of the affect of Ms. Sharp's alleged discussion with Mr. Carroccia and Mr. Claburn on Ms. Booth's decision. (DSMF ¶ 48; Plaintiff's Response to DSMF ¶ 48). Moreover, the undisputed evidence is that Ms. Booth did not act as a rubber stamp for an alleged recommendation by Mr. Carroccia, but rather made her own independent review of Plaintiff's situation. According to Ms. Booth, she treated Plaintiff just as she has all other employees in his [*50]  circumstance, and Plaintiff has not disputed this. (DSMF ¶ 48). Thus, Plaintiff has not alleged facts tending to show that Ms. Booth was a mere conduit for Mr. Carroccia or Ms. Sharp's alleged discriminatory animus. Hankins v. AirTran Airways, Inc., 237 F.App'x 513, 521 (11th Cir. 2007). Because Plaintiff cannot establish his prima facie case, summary judgment should be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's termination claim.

F. Plaintiff's Retaliation Claim
Although Plaintiff's complaint does not delineate whether Plaintiff is alleging retaliation under the ADA, Title VII or the ADEA, Plaintiff alleges in his October 1, 2007 EEOC charge attached to his Complaint that Defendant retaliated against him for speaking out in a August 23, 2006 meeting. (Def. Ex. 8). Plaintiff further explained his retaliation claim in his initial disclosures and deposition. According to Plaintiff, at the August 23, 2006 meeting, he voiced his concern as to why people with perfect attendance were not acknowledged by the company. (Pl. Dep. 59). Because another employee, who was also named Donald, expressed concern about black employees not being promoted at the same meeting, Plaintiff speculates that Mr. Henderson, his direct supervisor, and Mr. Claburn, his senior supervisor, confused Plaintiff [*51]  for the other Donald. (Pl. Dep. 207). In his initial disclosures and deposition, Plaintiff describes two incidents in which Mr. Henderson and Mr. Claburn spoke harshly to him after the August 23, 2006 meeting. According to Plaintiff, Mr. Henderson said he would make Plaintiff pay for opening his mouth, and when he brought Mr. Henderson's comments to the attention of Mr. Claburn, Mr. Claburn said that he did not care if Plaintiff called corporate. (Pl. Dep. 205-07).
Defendant contends that Plaintiff fails to establish his prima facie case of retaliation because he has not shown that he engaged in protected activity or that there was a causal connection between his protected activity and his termination and denial of light duty. Defendant further contends that Plaintiff's claim must be limited to alleged retaliatory acts which occurred between April 3, 2007 and May 7, 2007, because acts occurring prior to this time period are time-barred and outside the scope of his EEOC charge of retaliation.
Because Plaintiff's retaliation claim appears, in part, to be that Defendant retaliated against him because his colleagues believed he spoke out against black employees not being promoted, the Court [*52]  will analyze Plaintiff's retaliation claims under Title VII, the only statute Plaintiff relied upon in his Complaint that prohibits race discrimination and retaliation for complaints of race discrimination. Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee "because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). To make out a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, the plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in protected opposition to Title VII discrimination or participated in a Title VII proceeding; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action by the employer simultaneously with or subsequent to such opposition or participation; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir. 2008).

a. Plaintiff's Retaliation Claims Relating to his Request for Light Duty and his Termination Fail for Lack of Causation
To the extent that Plaintiff is arguing that the denial of his request for light duty and his termination were [*53]  retaliatory, his claim fails because he cannot establish a causal connection between his alleged protected activity and his termination and denial of light duty. To establish a causation, a plaintiff must, at a minimum, show that the decisionmakers were aware of her protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated. McCann v. Tillman, 562 F.3d 1370, 1376 (11th Cir. 2008). While close temporal proximity may help establish a causal connection, the Supreme Court has stated, however, that "mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action . . . must be 'very close.'" Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breedon, 532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001) (citing Richmond v. ONEOK, Inc., 120 F.3d 205, 209 (10th Cir. 1997) (three month period insufficient); Hughes v. Derwinski, 967 F.2d 1168, 1174-75 (7th Cir. 1992) (four month period insufficient)).
Plaintiff cannot establish his prima facie case because he neither presents evidence tending to show that the decisionmakers had knowledge of his protected expression or close temporal proximity between his alleged protected expression and the adverse actions against him. Plaintiff appears to consider the discussions at the August 23, 2006 meeting (both comments made by Plaintiff and the other employee named Donald at the meeting) to be protected activity triggering the protections of Title [*54]  VII's anti-retaliation provisions. Plaintiff presents no evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Mr. Carroccia or Ms. Booth were aware of those discussions during the August 23, 2006 meeting. Both Mr. Carroccia and Ms. Booth have denied that they were aware of Plaintiff's participation in discussions during the meeting. (DSMF ¶¶ 56-57; Carroccia Decl. ¶¶ 15-16; Booth Decl. ¶ 20). See Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, 996 F.2d 1155, 1163 (11th Cir. 1993) (plaintiff required, at minimum, to show decision-maker's actual awareness); Brungart v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000) (noting that the awareness requirement "rests upon common sense" because "[a] decision maker cannot have been motivated to retaliate by something unknown to him").
Additionally, Plaintiff has presented no other evidence tending to establish causation. Indeed, there was no temporal proximity between the August 23, 2006 meeting and Ms. Booth's decision to terminate Plaintiff which occurred more than eight months later. Similarly, Mr. Carroccia's decision to refuse Plaintiff's light duty requests occurred more than four months later, beginning in late December 2006. Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220-21 (11th Cir. 2004) (determining that three-month period between events did not allow a reasonable inference of a causal relation between the two); Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1248 (11th Cir. 2001) (finding three [*55]  and one half month time lag between protected activity and alleged retaliation, standing alone, insufficient to find causation). Because Plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether decisionmakers were aware of his alleged protected expression and because the temporal proximity between his alleged protected expression and the adverse actions was too great, Plaintiff cannot establish a causal connection between them. Therefore, summary judgment should be GRANTED as to his retaliation claims relating to his termination and denial of light duty.

b. Plaintiff's Claims that Alleged Comments by his Supervisor were Retaliatory Also Fail
Furthermore, to the extent that Plaintiff is claiming that comments by Mr. Claburn and Henderson were retaliatory, these comments are not actionable because they are time-barred. Before filing a private civil action under Title VII, a plaintiff must timely file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC "within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1); see also National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 109 (2002); Pijnenburg v. West Ga. Health Sys., Inc., 255 F.3d 1304, 1305 (11th Cir.), reh'g denied, 273 F.3d 1117 (11th Cir. 2001). "If a plaintiff fails to file an EEOC charge before the 180-day limitations period, the plaintiff's subsequent [*56]  lawsuit is barred and must be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies." Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 516 F.3d 955, 971 (11th Cir. 2008). The timely filing of an EEOC charge, however, "like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling." Forehand v. Florida. State Hosp. at Chattahoochee, 89 F.3d 1562, 1570 n.17 (11th Cir. 1996) (quoting Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 392, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1982)); see also Fouche v. Jekyll Island State Park Auth., 713 F.2d 1518, 1525 (11th Cir. 1983) ("[A]ll Title VII procedural requirements to suit are henceforth to be viewed as conditions precedent to suit rather than as jurisdictional requirements."). Plaintiff's supervisors made these comments more than 180 days prior to his filing either of his EEOC charges and Plaintiff presents no facts supporting the notion that the 180 day filings period should be equitably tolled. Accordingly, summary judgment should be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim relating to these charges.

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO THE COURT (Linda T. Walker)
In Plaintiff's September 29, 2008 Motion to the Court, Plaintiff, who is proceeding pro se, complains about Defendant's conduct during his deposition. Specifically, Plaintiff complains that(1) defense counsel insisted that Plaintiff's wife not be allowed in the room while Plaintiff was being deposed; (2) more than one lawyer questioned him; (3) at times defense counsel questioned him about irrelevant matters, stopped [*57]  questioning him, and left the room; and (4) Defendant's lawyers urged him to settle, arguing that "the Judge is going to throw this case out." Because Plaintiff's deposition has already occurred, Plaintiff requests no relief, and Plaintiff's concerns have already been addressed in this Court's March 19, 2009 Order, Plaintiff's motion is DENIED AS MOOT. Docket Entry [34].

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's September 29, 2008 Motion to the Court is DENIED AS MOOT, and the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED. Docket Entries [26, 34].
SO ORDERED, REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED, this 16th day of June, 2009.
