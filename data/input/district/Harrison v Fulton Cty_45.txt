Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [75] and Amended Motion for Summary Judgment [77].1 For the reasons explained below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that said Motions be GRANTED.

I. RELEVANT PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Guy W. Harrison, III, began this action pro se by filing his Complaint [1-1] on October 28, 2013. He later obtained counsel, and after some preliminary motion work and the filing of a First Amended Complaint [19], on November 20, 2014, plaintiff filed an eleven-Count Consolidated Second Amended Complaint ("Compl.") [38], which alleges the following:
Count I Creation of a racially hostile work environment and race discrimination in violation of  [*2]  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. ("Title VII");
Count II Failure to accommodate and creation of a hostile work environment in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. ("ADA");
Count III Retaliation in violation of Title VII;
Count IV Race-based failure to promote and creation of a racially hostile work environment in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 ("Section 1981");
Count V Retaliation in violation of Section 1981;
Count VI Negligent hiring, training, supervision, and/or retention in violation of Georgia law;
Count VII Gross negligence and negligence per se in violation of Georgia law; 
Count VIII Punitive damages;
Count IX Attorneys' fees and costs;
Count X Creation of a racially hostile work environment and race discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 ("Section 1983"); and
Count XI Retaliation in violation of Section 1983.
(Compl. ¶¶ 42-154.)
Defendant, Fulton County, Georgia (the "County"), filed a Motion to Dismiss [39] the Complaint on December 4, 2014. In a Report and Recommendation ("R&R") [44] dated June 8, 2015, the Honorable E. Clayton Scofield III, United States Magistrate Judge, recommended dismissal of Counts VI-IX, but recommended that Counts I-V and X-XI be allowed to proceed. (Id. at 29.)2
The County filed Objections [46] to the R&R on June [*3]  22, 2015. On July 29, 2015, the Honorable Orinda D. Evans, United States District Judge, issued an Order [48] adopting in part and rejecting in part the R&R. Judge Evans sustained the County's objection to that part of the R&R which recommended that plaintiff be allowed to pursue hostile work environment claims based on his race and/or disability, finding that such claims had not been administratively exhausted. (Id. at 11.) Judge Evans adopted the R&R in all other respects. (Id.)3
Given Judge Evans's Order, the only claims remaining for consideration by this Court are as follows:
1. Race discrimination (Count I) and retaliation (Count III) in violation of Title VII;
2. Race discrimination and retaliation in violation of Section 1983 (Counts IV and V merged into Counts X and XI); and
3. Failure to accommodate in violation of the ADA (Count II).

II. STATEMENT OF FACTS
To assist with framing the undisputed material facts, Local Rule 56.1 B.(1) requires a movant for summary judgment to file along with its motion and brief a "separate, concise, numbered statement of the material facts to which the movant contends there is no genuine issue to be tried." Id. In compliance with that Rule, the County filed Defendant's Statement [*4]  of Undisputed Material Facts as to Which There is no Genuine Issue for Trial ("DSUMF") [75-1]. The Local Rules require the respondent (i.e., the non-moving plaintiff here) to submit a response to that statement of undisputed material facts which contains "individually numbered, concise, nonargumentative responses corresponding to each of the movant's numbered undisputed material facts." N.D. Ga. R. 56.1 B.(2)a.(1). Mr. Harrison complied with that Rule by filing Plaintiff's Response and Opposition to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts ("PR-DSUMF") [83].
The Local Rules also allow the respondent to submit a separate statement of additional facts which he contends are material and present a genuine issue for trial, but this separate statement must meet the requirements of Local Rule 56.1 B.(1). See N.D. Ga. R. 56.1 B.(2)b. For example, each material fact contained in this separate statement "must be numbered separately and supported by a citation to evidence proving such fact." N.D. Ga. R. 56.1 B.(1). However, Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts ("PSMF") [59] often fails to follow the above-quoted Local Rule. Many paragraphs of PSMF contain multiple sentences, which prompted objections [*5]  from the County. See generally Def. Fulton Cty.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Stat. of Mat. Facts ("DR-PSMF") [89]. The Court recognizes these objections and seeks to accommodate them by citing infra to specific sentences (e.g., abbreviated "s. 1") of PSMF.
The Court uses DSUMF and PSMF as the basis for this Statement of Facts, applying the following conventions. When a party admits the other's proposed fact (in whole or in part), the Court accepts that fact (or the part admitted) as undisputed for the purposes of this Report and Recommendation and cites both the proposed fact and the response. When a party denies the other's proposed fact (in whole or in part), the Court reviews the record cited and determines whether that denial is supported, and if it is, whether any fact dispute is material. The Court sometimes modifies a proposed fact per the other party's response or the record cited to reflect the evidence more accurately. The Court also includes some facts drawn from its review of the record, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3), excludes immaterial proposed facts,4 and rules on objections to proposed facts. Finally, the Court views the record in light of the standards for summary judgment set out Part II, infra.

A. [*6]  Fulton County's Water and Sewer Operation
Defendant provides both water and sewer services in unincorporated Fulton County north of the Chattahoochee River (North Fulton) and only sewer services in unincorporated South Fulton County. (DSUMF ¶ 1; PR-DSUMF ¶ 1.) Defendant has significantly more customers and more lines to service and maintain in North Fulton than it does in South Fulton. (DSUMF ¶ 2; PR-DSUMF ¶ 2.) Defendant operates three large capacity wastewater treatment plants in North Fulton; in South Fulton, it operates one large capacity wastewater treatment plant and one small capacity wastewater treatment plant. (DSUMF ¶ 3, as modified per record cited in PR-DSUMF ¶ 3.) North Fulton has more employees and approximately three times more equipment than South Fulton. (DSUMF ¶ 4; PR-DSUMF ¶ 4.) The distribution of equipment between North Fulton and South Fulton is based on the needs of the work, the County's budget, and the ability to borrow from one area to help out the other area. (DSUMF ¶ 5.)5

B. Plaintiff's Employment and the Department's Restructuring
The County hired plaintiff as a Sewer System Superintendent on or about July 15, 2000. (DSUMF ¶ 34; PR-DSUMF ¶ 34; see also [*7]  PSMF ¶ 1; DR-PSMF ¶ 1.) All Sewer System Superintendents performed physical activities in their work. (DSUMF ¶ 46; PR-DSUMF ¶ 46.)
In 2001, plaintiff was terminated, filed a grievance appealing that termination, and was reinstated. (DSUMF ¶ 35; PR-DSUMF ¶ 35; see also PSMF ¶ 5; DR-PSMF ¶ 5.) Between plaintiff's termination in 2001 and his reinstatement later that same year, the Public Works Department's new Deputy Director, Chris Browning, restructured parts of that organization. (DSUMF ¶ 36.) Mr. Browning testified that when he did so, he did not know plaintiff was returning to work and had no knowledge of any prior claims he may have had against the County. (DSUMF ¶ 39, as modified per PR-DSUMF ¶ 39.)
When plaintiff was reinstated in 2001, giving him supervisory responsibilities would have meant dissecting the restructured group, so he was given a technical role. (DSUMF ¶ 37;6 see also PSMF ¶ 6; DR-PSMF ¶ 6 (stating that upon his reinstatement, the County placed plaintiff in a technical role where he supervised no employees).)

C. Plaintiff's 2006 Cancer Treatment
Mr. Harrison was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006. He applied for FMLA leave and was out of work for treatment for [*8]  about six months. When plaintiff returned to work in 2007, he was under the supervision of David Tucker, Manager of the CMOM Program (discussed infra), and began working on that Program. (PSMF ¶¶ 11, 16; DR-PSMF ¶¶ 11, 16; see also DSUMF ¶¶ 42-43; PR-DSUMF ¶¶ 42-43.)7 Mr. Harrison's work on the CMOM project was primarily technical from that point until late-2008, when he began to receive training for field work. (Harrison Aff. [87] ¶ 9.)

D. The CMOM Program

1. CMOM and Development of the Work Plan
The acronym "CMOM" refers to Capacity Management Operations and Maintenance. (DSUMF ¶ 6; PR-DSUMF ¶ 6.) Wastewater overflows were prevalent in North Fulton because of the area's growth. (DSUMF ¶ 7; PR-DSUMF ¶ 7.) The County developed the CMOM program in part to focus attention and effort on reducing and eliminating such overflows. (DSUMF ¶ 8; PR-DSUMF ¶ 8.)
Between 2003 and 2008, the County engaged a contractor named Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc. (the "Contractor") to, among other things, inventory and survey the manholes and water valves relative to the CMOM program. (DSUMF ¶ 9; PR-DSUMF ¶ 9.) Under the provisions of its contract with the County, the Contractor was not required to look [*9]  for a manhole or valve for more than twenty minutes before the Contractor could move on to the next job. (DSUMF ¶ 10; PR-DSUMF ¶ 10.) 
When the Contractor's contract expired in 2008, CMOM Program Manager Tucker was directed to create a work plan (the "Work Plan") to map, evaluate, and record data about 4,000 difficult to find manholes and water valves that the Contractor had not located. (DSUMF ¶ 11; PR-DSUMF ¶ 11; see also PSMF ¶ 17; DR-PSMF ¶ 17.) CMOM program manager Tucker chose to locate the program's office in North Fulton. (DSUMF ¶ 14.)8
When he was developing the Work Plan, CMOM Program Manager Tucker showed a draft of it to plaintiff, who pointed out some safety issues and asserted that changing the office location to North Fulton (Alpharetta) would bring travel hardship to him and some of his co-workers. (DSUMF ¶ 15, as modified per PR-DSUMF ¶ 15 and record cited.) On August 26, 2008, plaintiff sent an email to Mr. Browning (with a copy to Mr. Tucker) which reads as follows:
I request to be allowed to work at the South maintenance Center. There is a vacant office and I can make a smooth transition. I would like to begin on Monday, September 1, 2008.
I would like to make this [*10]  change of work locations due to medical reasons and Also [sic], I can save on the cost of fuel with the shorter commute to the South office.
(Browning Dep. Ex. 92 [87-1], at 2; see also DSUMF ¶ 16, citing this email.)
Mr. Browning responded to the above email that day (with copies to Mr. Tucker, Ms. Shands, and Angela Parker (the Director of Public Works)), and informed plaintiff that the County was assessing the assignments of a number of employees charged with CMOM projects, that Human Resources was analyzing the department's needs, and would make a recommendation, but that in the meantime, no one would be relocated. (Browning Dep. Ex. 92 [87-1], at 2.)9
Plaintiff asserts that, "[w]hen the CMOM was being prepared, [he] submitted a letter from his physician saying the CMOM work would adversely affect his medical condition." (PSMF ¶ 18.) The record cite provided to support this assertion is "Exhibit C, Harrison Affidavit." (Id.) Because PSMF does not cite a specific paragraph of the Harrison Affidavit [85-8], the Court reviewed it and found only one potentially relevant but vague paragraph, which states as follows: "Sometime before April 20, 2009, I provided my supervisor [*11]  with a note from my physician which stated I needed a reasonable accommodation." (Harrison Aff. [85-8] ¶ 7.)
PSMF ¶ 18 is unsupported by the record cited, because paragraph 7 of the Harrison Affidavit (1) does not mention the specific time period asserted in PSMF ¶ 18 (i.e., when the CMOM was being prepared), and (2) does not aver that the purported letter from plaintiff's physician stated that CMOM work would adversely affect his medical condition. Moreover, in response to PSMF ¶ 18, the County notes that plaintiff has not produced a copy of any physician's letter submitted when the CMOM was being prepared. (See DR-PSMF ¶ 18.) The County received only two letters from plaintiff's physician and placed both of them in the record as exhibits (discussed infra). Plaintiff does not challenge these statements. In fact, in an interrogatory response plaintiff stated that he had submitted only two letters from his doctor. (See Pl.'s Resp. and Objs. To Def.'s Request for Interrogs. No. 18 [75-8], at 17 ("My doctor, James Bennett, Urologist sent two letters stating that I should not do any heavy lifting as it could [be] detrimental to my condition and result in negative complications.").) Thus, [*12]  the Court excludes PSMF ¶ 18, because there is no evidence that plaintiff submitted any letter from his doctor while the CMOM was being prepared.10

2. The November 2008 Work Plan
The Work Plan that CMOM Program Manager Tucker developed provided for two surveying teams, each having an Engineer II (as the project manager) and a Sewer System Superintendent.11 One team included Engineer II James Mark and plaintiff (African American) as the Sewer System Superintendent. The other team included Engineer II Clint Ghahramani and Jim Henson (Caucasian) as the Sewer System Superintendent. (DSUMF ¶ 12.) Mr. Henson's team had a third member, maintenance worker Marcus Hendricks. (Id., as modified per PR-DSUMF ¶ 12; see also PSMF ¶ 36; DR-PSMF ¶ 36.)
Messrs. Harrison and Henson held the same title (i.e., Sewer System Superintendent), but the Work Plan gave them different duties. (PSMF ¶ 35, ss. 1-2.) According to the Work Plan, plaintiff was "responsible for surveying water and wastewater features and collecting attributes of same." (Id. at s. 3, quoting Work Plan [87-7], at 8.) Mr. Henson was "responsible for locating manholes and valves for the contractor to adjust. He will assist the surveying crew when [*13]  necessary, such as when someone is out on vacation or is ill." (Id. at ss. 4-5, quoting Work Plan [87-7], at 8.)
As defendant correctly observes (see DR-PSMF ¶ 35), the Work Plan states that the locating aspect of the project, performed by the team to which Mr. Henson was assigned, involved "the use of metal detectors and closed circuit television when necessary." (Work Plan [87-7], at 3.) The survey aspect of the project, performed by the team to which plaintiff was assigned, appears more sophisticated, as it involved
the use of Real Time Kinetic (RTK) global positioning system (GPS) to obtain the x, y and z coordinates of the feature[']s location." . . . In addition to coordinates, the crew assigned to survey will also obtain attributes of the features such as depth, invert elevation, location of structure, condition, type of cover, etc.
(Id.)
Mr. Browning and Alysia Shands, who served as the Public Works Human Resources Manager, consulted with the Fulton County Personnel Department to make sure that the duties outlined in the Work Plan for plaintiff and Mr. Henson were consistent with the Sewer System Superintendent's job description. (DSUMF ¶ 13.)12
Plaintiff began training [*14]  for the field work and survey aspect of the CMOM program assigned to him under the Work Plan in late-November 2008. (PSMF ¶ 15; DR-PSMF ¶ 15.)13 Mr. Harrison avers that the surveying work was strenuous and labor intensive; that he was required to lift manhole covers that generally weighed in excess of 100 pounds; and that he was not given equipment that would help lift those manholes covers. (Harrison Aff. [85-8] ¶ 10.) Mr. Henson, who had the same title (i.e., Sewer System Superintendent) and supervisors as plaintiff, was also required to locate manholes, but plaintiff claims that Mr. Henson did not have to lift their covers. (Id. ¶ 12; see also PSMF ¶ 38, ss. 1-2; DR-PSMF ¶ 38.)
Mr. Harrison complained that he did not receive the equipment he required to perform successfully these job duties, including computers, GIS Survey equipment and other related survey equipment, including but not limited to rods, manhole pullers, traffic signs, sledgehammers and measuring tape. (PSMF ¶ 43.) The County admits that plaintiff made these complaints (see DR-PSMF ¶ 43), but argues that there is no evidence that the denial of any such equipment was related to his race or in retaliation for anything [*15]  he had done. Moreover, plaintiff submits no evidence that he ever received any discipline for poor job performance that he could have blamed on the absence of equipment he allegedly required.
Mr. Harrison also claims that he was given work assignments that were of a lower level than his white co-workers. (PSMF ¶ 44.) He argues that he was not given any employees to supervise, and he was assigned field work that subordinate employees would normally perform. (Id.) However, as the County correctly points out, plaintiff testified that both he and Mr. Henson were assigned duties that were outside of their job classification, i.e., performing work that would normally be performed by persons they supervised. (DR-PSMF ¶ 44; see also Harrison Dep. [77-3], at 27.) As discussed infra, the County subsequently agreed that both men had been assigned work outside of their classification.

E. Plaintiff's January 28, 2009 Grievance
On January 28, 2009, Mr. Harrison filed a grievance with the County which states as follows:
1. The new job assignment of surveying manholes and water valves will exacerbate my current medical condition.
The Assistant Director Chris Browning denied a previous request for me to [*16]  report to the South Maintenance Facility due to health issues and the increase [sic] cost of transportation.
2. The new work description is not comparable to the essential job description of my job classification (Superintendent).
The job duties of the new assignment relegate my performing manual labor tasks and not supervisory functions as my primary role.
3. Due to heavy traffic conditions safety is a primary concern with the new job Requirement.
4. Mr. Chris Browning is changing the reporting stations to a centralize [sic] location that will bring hardship to myself and fellow co workers.
Mr. Browning has a history of unfair employee practices and harassment of minority employees; and as a result several EEOC complaints have been file [sic].
Requested Remedy:
1. Public Works to assign work that is in accordance with my essential job duties.
2. Allow me to report to the South Maintenance facility and provide an office as the other Superintendents.
(Browning Dep. Ex. 94 [87-2], at 3; see also DSUMF ¶ 17; PR-DSUMF ¶ 17; PSMF ¶ 21; DR-PSMF ¶ 21.)14 The record reflects that Ms. Parker denied the grievance on February 26, 2009, which led plaintiff to appeal, resulting in a Grievance Review Committee [*17]  decision, discussed infra.

F. February 11, 2009 Contact with the Office of Disability Affairs
Mr. Harrison completed an "Understanding and Consent to Proceed" form with the Office of Disability Affairs on February 11, 2009. (See Belle Dep. Ex. 143 [87-11], at 4 (Bates No. FC 002856); see also PSMF ¶ 23, s. 1.) This form gives the Office of Disability Affairs authorization to evaluate the employee's medical condition, to communicate with his physician, and to start the reasonable accommodation process. (PSMF ¶ 24; DR-PSMF ¶ 24.) Plaintiff placed his initials beside a number of paragraphs on that form acknowledging an understanding of his rights under the ADA and the reasonable accommodation process, but he also placed his initials beside the following statement: "I do not want to proceed with the Reasonable Accommodation Process." (See Belle Dep. Ex. 143 [87-11], at 4 (Bates No. FC 002856) (emphasis added); see also DSUMF ¶ 23.) Although plaintiff denies DSUMF ¶ 23 (see PR-DSUMF ¶ 23), the document he submitted to the Office of Disability Affairs speaks for itself.

G. Ms. Shand's February 25, 2009 Email to Plaintiff
As a result of receiving plaintiff's grievance, Public Works Human Resources [*18]  Manager Shands sent an email to plaintiff on February 25, 2009, referring him to the County's Office of Disability Affairs. (DSUMF ¶ 22; PR-DSUMF ¶ 22; see also PSMF ¶ 25, s. 1; Belle Dep. Ex. 145 [187-12], at 1.) On February 27, 2009, Mr. Harrison sent an email in response to Ms. Shands and stated that he had contacted the Office of Disability Affairs on February 11, 2009. (PSMF ¶ 25, s. 2; see also email [85-3], at 2.) Ms. Shands responded that same date via email confirming that he had contacted the Office of Disability Affairs on February 11. (PSMF ¶ 25, s. 3; see also email [85-3], at 1.)

H. April 20, 2009 Contact with the Office of Disability Affairs
On April 20, 2009, Mr. Harrison completed a second "Understanding and Consent to Proceed" form at the Office of Disability Affairs. (See Belle Dep. Ex. 143 [87-11], at 5 (Bates No. FC 002857).) This time he did not place his initials beside the sentence which states: "I do not want to proceed with the Reasonable Accommodation Process." (Id.) He also completed an "Intake Form" for that Office in which he stated that he could not lift, push, or pull any object over ten pounds. (PSMF ¶ 26, modified per DR-PSMF ¶ 26.) The Office of Disability [*19]  Affairs immediately sought information about plaintiff's medical condition from his physician. (See Apr. 20, 2009 Fax Cover Sheet and attachments from Wayne Stokes to Dr. James Bennett [87-11], at 11-17.) However, as shown infra, it took plaintiff's physician about a month to respond to the County's information request.

I. Plaintiff's May 15, 2009 EEOC Charge
On May 15, 2009, Mr. Harrison filed a charge of discrimination against the County with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). (PSMF ¶ 7, s. 1; DR-PSMF ¶ 7.) This charge, with boxes checked for discrimination based on race, retaliation, and disability, alleged that discrimination began on April 26, 2009, and provided the following particulars:
I. . . . In March 2009, I participated in an internal investigation on behalf of a co-worker who filed both internal and EEOC charges of discrimination against Fulton County.15 Since March 2009, I have been subjected to different terms and conditions of employment by not being provided the appropriate work equipment to perform my job and being denied opportunities for promotion. On April 26, 2009, I was assigned different job assignments that my White co-workers are not required [*20]  to perform.
Also, I have been denied reasonable accommodation for my disability. I made my request for reasonable accommodation to Human Resources.
II. In reference to the new assignments, management informed me that by assigning me to the new job duties that it was saving the county an enormous amount of money. In reference to my accommodation, Human Resources is claiming that it does not have any knowledge of my disability.
III. I believe that I have been discriminated against because of my race (African American) . . . , because of my disability . . . , and in retaliation for opposing unlawful employment practices in violation of the ADA.
(Chg. No. 410-2009-04014, filed as Belle Dep. Ex. 138 [87-9].)

J. The First Doctor's Note and the County's ADA Certification
On May 28, 2009, plaintiff's physician, James K. Bennett, M.D., submitted documents to the Office of Disability Affairs which indicated that Mr. Harrison was twenty-five percent disabled. (PSMF ¶ 27, s. 1; DR-PSMF ¶ 27.) He wrote that plaintiff should lift no more than 100 pounds. (PSMF ¶ 27, s. 2; DR-PSMF ¶ 27.) The doctor also noted that Mr. Harrison may need to urinate frequently, or about every one to two hours. (PSMF ¶ 27, [*21]  s. 3; DR-PSMF ¶ 27; see also Belle Dep. Ex. 143 [87-11], at 24 (Bates No. FC 002876)). No other restrictions were listed. (DSUMF ¶ 24; PR-DSUMF ¶ 24.)
By letter dated June 2, 2009 [85-4], the Office of Disability Affairs certified plaintiff as an individual with disabilities for purposes of the ADA. (PSMF ¶ 31, s. 1; DR-PSMF ¶ 31.) As a result of that certification, an interactive meeting was scheduled for June 19, 2009, between plaintiff, the Office of Disability Affairs, and the Department of Public Works to discuss plaintiff's need for a reasonable accommodation. (DSUMF ¶ 25; PR-DSUMF ¶ 25.)

K. The June 18, 2009 Grievance Review Committee Decision
On June 18, 2009, the Fulton County Grievance Review Committee held that the County's Public Works Department had erred in its practices and procedures. (PSMF ¶ 45, s. 1; DR-PSMF ¶ 45.) Specifically, the Grievance Review Committee found that plaintiff was working outside of his class specification. (DSUMF ¶ 18; PR-DSUMF ¶ 18.)16 The Grievance Review Committee thus recommended that the Department assign Mr. Harrison duties and responsibilities that were commensurate with his essential job duties. (PSMF ¶ 45, s. 2; DR-PSMF ¶ 45; see also Harrison [*22]  Dep. Ex. 5 [77-2], at 4-5, and Harrison Dep. Ex. 6 [77-2], at 6.)
In response to that Grievance Review Committee decision, the County made an effort to revise the Work Plan so that Sewer System Superintendents Harrison and Henson could have supervisory responsibilities and also complete the project of locating water assets. (DSUMF ¶ 20; PR-DSUMF ¶ 20.) Ultimately, the County restructured the Department back to the way it was in 2001, with four Sewer System Superintendents—two in North Fulton and two in South Fulton—all performing the same work. (DSUMF ¶ 21; PR-DSUMF ¶ 21.) On August 19, 2009, the CMOM Work Plan was revised and assigned Mr. Harrison and Mr. Henson identical duties. (PSMF ¶ 46; DR-PSMF ¶ 46.)

L. Two Meetings on June 19, 2009
On June 19, 2009, immediately before the scheduled interactive meeting was set to begin, plaintiff met with Wayne Stokes and Tilford Belle17 of the Fulton County Office of Disability Affairs and the Fulton County Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, respectively, about his need for accommodation. (DSUMF ¶ 26; PR-DSUMF ¶ 26; see also PSMF ¶ 29, ss. 1-2.) In this meeting outside the presence of the Public Works Department's management, plaintiff told [*23]  Mr. Stokes and Mr. Belle that he needed to relieve himself "maybe once an hour." (DSUMF ¶ 27.)18
In response to the inquiry from Messrs. Stokes and Belle about how long he thought it would take him to access restroom facilities when he was assigned to the field, the County contends that plaintiff responded, "30 to 45 minutes." (DSUMF ¶ 28.) Plaintiff denies the previous statement, citing his deposition testimony wherein he stated that he gave Messrs. Stoke and Belle no specific time frame because it would vary depending on how close his work location was to a public restroom. (PR-DSUMF ¶ 28.)
Plaintiff contends that, during this meeting, he was told to keep a log of every time he went to the restroom so that the County could monitor how often he needed bathroom breaks. (PSMF ¶ 29, s. 3.)19 The County denies the preceding proposed fact, asserting that neither Mr. Stokes, Mr. Belle, nor anyone from the Department of Public Works told plaintiff that he was required to keep a log regarding the times he used the restroom. (DSUMF ¶ 32.)20
The parties then held the scheduled ADA interactive meeting. (See Mem. of June 24, 2009 from Wayne Stokes to Angela Parker [87-11], at 36; see [*24]  also PSMF ¶ 31, s. 2; DR-PSMF ¶ 31.) Plaintiff avers that the accommodation he received was the assignment of an additional employee to his team to lift the heavy manhole covers. (Harrison Aff. [87] ¶ 14.)21 Plaintiff further avers that this crew member was not able to lift the manhole covers and that he had to help him. (Id. ¶ 15.) Mr. Harrison adds that he told Mr. Tucker about this matter, but nothing was done. (Id. ¶ 16.) As a result, plaintiff contends that he was still required to lift manhole covers that weighed in excess of 100 pounds. (PSMF ¶ 32.) As discussed infra, the County contends that plaintiff was not required to lift manhole covers; that he was assigned a crew member to do that; and if he was still lifting them, then he was disregarding his physician's orders and the accommodation provided to him. (DR-PSMF ¶ 32.)

M. Plaintiff's June 24, 2009 EEOC Charge
On June 24, 2009, plaintiff filed a second EEOC charge against the County. (PSMF ¶ 8, s. 1; DR-PSMF ¶ 8.) This charge, with boxes checked for discrimination based on retaliation and disability, alleges that discrimination began on June 19, 2009, and provides the following particulars:
I. . . . I have requested reasonable [*25]  accommodation for my disability. On May 15, 2009, I filed an EEOC Charge (410-2009-04014). On June 19, 2009, I was advised by management that I needed to keep a log of the times I use the restroom facilities. I have also been assigned to perform tasks of a lower level job classification in the field that other co-workers in my same position are not required to perform.
II. I believe that I have been discriminated against because I am a person with a disability . . . and in retaliation for filing my previous charge in violation of the ADA.
(Chg. No. 410-2009-04675, filed as Belle Dep. Ex. 140 [87-10].)22

N. The Log
Plaintiff maintains that he began keeping a log of his bathroom breaks, and had his co-workers sign it to verify the times. (PSMF ¶ 30.) The County admits that Mr. Harrison kept a log with entries on 6/26/09, 6/29/09, 6/30/09, 7/21/09, 7/22/09, 7/23/09, 7/24/09, 7/27/09, 7/29/09 and 8/3/09, and that there are signatures at the bottom of the pages; however, the County asserts that the signatures are unrelated to any particular entries or times and it is impossible to tell what the numbers represent. (DR-PSMF ¶ 30.) A copy of this log is in the record as Browning Dep. Ex. 101 [87-5] [*26]  and labeled, "Guy's Personal Log." (Id. at 2; see also Harrison Dep. [77-3], at 104 (identifying log as one recording his restroom breaks).) Construing the evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiff, this document appears to be a log of plaintiff's bathroom breaks at various dates in the summer of 2009.

O. The Second Doctor's Note
On July 28, 2009, Dr. Bennett wrote a letter to the County stating that plaintiff "should not be doing any heaving lifting as this can prove detrimental to his condition and result in negative complications." (See letter dated July 28, 2009 [87-11], at 19.)

P. Meeting of August 21, 2009 and Follow-up Memorandum
Mr. Belle states that he learned on August 21, 2009, that Mr. Harrison had been assisting the maintenance worker assigned to his team to lift manhole covers in violation of his doctor's restrictions on the amount of weight (100 pounds) that he could lift. (Belle Decl. [75-2] ¶ 20.) Mr. Belle and Mr. Stokes spoke to Mr. Harrison about his need to abide strictly by his doctor's orders. According to Mr. Belle, Mr. Harrison explained that the worker assigned to perform the heavy lifting for him was incompetent and needed plaintiff's help to lift the manhole covers. [*27] 23 (Id.)
After this meeting, Mr. Stokes sent a memorandum to plaintiff (with a copy to Mr. Belle) addressing plaintiff's non-compliance with his medical restrictions. (Belle Decl. [75-2] ¶ 20.) This memorandum provides as follows:
This memo serves as a reminder to your request for ADA Reasonable Accommodations and our meeting held on Friday, August 21, 2009.
1. You are to ensure that all work activities and actions are in compliance with your physician's latest medical restrictions dated July 28, 2009, "should not be doing any heavy lifting".
2. You are to forward any updated medical information to this office. This will ensure compliance with your ADA Reasonable Accommodations.
You are to notify this office and your supervisory team of any future problems that interfere with your accommodations.
3. Please inform this office of any changes in your current assignment or additional duties as a Sewer Systems Superintendent.
4. Please document any issues or concerns that are impacting your ADA Reasonable Accommodations as you attempt to perform the essential functions of your job.
5. Your ADA accommodations will be re-evaluated within the next 30 days to ensure ADA compliance. This office will [*28]  proceed in developing an ADA Reasonable Accommodations Plan.
Should you have any questions regarding the above, do not hesitate to contact me.
(Aug. 26, 2009 Mem. from Stokes to Harrison, filed as Ex. B to Belle Decl. [75-2], at 17.)

Q. Plaintiff's Automobile Accident on August 27, 2009
Plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident while working on August 27, 2009. (Harrison Dep. [77-3], at 108.) He was injured and subsequently missed some work, returning in January 2010. (See Jan. 29, 2010 Reasonable Accom. Status Rpt. [87-11], at 30.) He was approved to return to full duty, including driving in May 2010 (but with the aforementioned lifting restriction). (See May 6, 2010 Reasonable Accom. Status Rpt. [87-11], at 26.) During the interim, in October 2009, the County removed plaintiff from performing field work. (PSMF ¶ 34, as modified per record cited.)

R. The September 2009 Desk Audit
Plaintiff contends that the duties assigned to him in the CMOM Work Plan (i.e., surveying manholes and working in the field) should have been performed by someone he supervised and were thus outside of his job classification. (PSMF ¶ 19, s. 2.)24 In a memorandum dated September 11, 2009 [87-6], County personnel [*29]  department officials wrote that they had conducted a desk audit on September 10, pursuant to a request from the County Manager, to determine whether the duties performed by Sewer System Superintendents Henson, Harrison, and Searles were aligned with the essential duties of the position as described in its job classification. (Id. at 2.) They found as follows:
Based upon the fact-finding above, it has been determined that incumbents James Henson and Guy Harrison, Sewer System Superintendents (C41) perform the duties as described in the analysis. The duties performed are not closely aligned with the essential duties as described in the job classification of Sewer System Superintendent (C41). Mr. Henson and Mr. Harrison indicated that they were recently transferred (two months ago) from South Fulton Sewer Division to Maxwell Road. With regard to incumbent Andrea Searles, it has been determined that the duties performed are in close alignment with the essential duties as described in the job classification of Sewer System Superintendent (C41).
(Id. at 3.) Mr. Henson is Caucasian and Ms. Searles is African American. (Harrison Dep. [77-3], at 81-82.)

S. Promotional Opportunities for Plaintiff 2008/2013
Plaintiff [*30]  proposes facts about his unsuccessful applications for promotion to three positions in the Department: (1) water services manager (July 25, 2008), (2) senior construction project manager (March 26, 2009), and (3) deputy land manager (January 25, 2011). (PSMF ¶¶ 47, 49-50; DR-PSMF ¶¶ 47, 49-50; see also Pl.'s Ex. H [85-7], at 1 (listing jobs sought and application dates).)
In June 2008, plaintiff interviewed for the position of water services manager. (DSUMF ¶ 51; PR-DSUMF ¶ 51.) Mr. Belle from the Fulton County EEO office observed these interviews. (DSUMF ¶ 52; PR-DSUMF ¶ 52.) The standard procedure used in Fulton County was followed here: Interview questions were developed prior to the interviews. The interviews were conducted by a panel asking these same questions of each candidate. Each panelist gave a numerical score to the candidates' responses. (DSUMF ¶ 53.)25 No candidate scored high enough to qualify for the position. (DSUMF ¶ 54, deemed admitted per note 25, supra.) Mr. Belle interviewed each candidate—including plaintiff—after the panel interview to ascertain whether there was any aspect of the process that the candidate felt was unfair; plaintiff did not report any perception [*31]  that the process was unfair. (DSUMF ¶ 55.)26
Neither party submits any evidence about the position of Senior Construction Project Manager for which plaintiff reportedly applied in March 2009. Although the document Mr. Harrison submitted which lists his employment application history shows him as "qualified" for that job (see Pl.'s Ex. H [85-7], at 1), he must not have been interviewed. Given that plaintiff has the burden of proof, and has submitted no evidence about who applied and was chosen over him for this job, the Court cannot consider it.
Plaintiff opines that he and Ms. Searles were the most qualified individuals for the Sewer System Superintendent II positions that were available in 2013. (PSMF ¶ 48.) The County promoted Ms. Searles. (Harrison Dep. [77-3], at 152.) Mr. Belle also observed the interviews for the position of Sewer System Superintendent II. (DSUMF ¶ 56; PR-DSUMF ¶ 56.) The standard procedure used in Fulton County was followed here as well: Interview questions were developed prior to the interviews. The interviews were conducted by a panel asking these same questions of each candidate. Each panelist gave a numerical score to the candidates' responses. (DSUMF [*32]  ¶ 57, deemed admitted per note 25, supra.) The promotions were given to the two candidates with the highest scores. (DSUMF ¶ 58, deemed admitted per note 25, supra.) Mr. Belle interviewed each candidate—including plaintiff—after the panel interview to ascertain whether there was any aspect of the process that the candidate felt was unfair; plaintiff did not report any perception that the process was unfair. (DSUMF ¶ 59.)27 It was Mr. Belle's opinion that plaintiff did not interview as well as the other candidates did in both 2008 and 2013. (DSUMF ¶ 60, deemed admitted per note 25, supra.)28

III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
A "court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of "informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those materials that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 232 F.3d 836, 840 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). Those materials may include "depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes [*33]  of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). "Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
The non-moving party is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence "showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the non-movant's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). If in response the non-moving party does not sufficiently support an essential element of his case as to which he bears the burden of proof, summary judgment is appropriate. Rice-Lamar, 232 F.3d at 840. "In determining whether genuine issues of material fact exist, [the Court] resolve[s] all ambiguities and draw[s] all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-moving party." Id. (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255).
In deciding a summary judgment motion, the court's function is not to resolve issues of material fact but rather to determine whether there are any such issues to be tried. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251. The applicable substantive law will identify those facts that are material. Id. at 248. Facts that are disputed, [*34]  but which do not affect the outcome of the case, are not material and thus will not preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id. Genuine disputes are those in which "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. For factual issues to be "genuine," they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). When the record as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-movant, there is no "genuine issue for trial." Id. at 587.

IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS

A. Plaintiff's Race Discrimination and Retaliation Claims
Plaintiff alleges race discrimination and retaliation in violation of both Title VII and Section 1983. (See supra Part I.) Claims under Title VII and Section 1983 employ the same analytical framework. Koch v. Rugg, 221 F.3d 1283, 1297 n.31 (11th Cir. 2000). However, Title VII and Section 1983 claims have different timeliness rules. For example, under Title VII a plaintiff must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of a discrete discriminatory or retaliatory act. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). If he fails to do so, then a subsequent suit related to that discrete act is procedurally barred and must be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. See Delaware State Coll. v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 258, 101 S. Ct. 498, 66 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1980). Although there is no similar administrative exhaustion for a Section 1983 claim, the "statute of limitations for a section 1983 claim [*35]  arising out of events occurring in Georgia is two years." Combs v. Nelson, 419 F. App'x 884, 886 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam).
Plaintiff filed this suit in October 2013. Because almost all of the events listed in the Statement of Facts occurred before October 2011, plaintiff concedes that his only Section 1983 claim relates to defendant's alleged race-based failure to promote him to the Sewer System Superintendent II position in April 2013. (Pl.'s Resp. Br. [84], at 13-14.)29 Therefore, the Court begins in Part III.A.2. with plaintiff's only Section 1983 claim, then addresses his Title VII retaliation claim in Part III.A.3., and concludes with his Title VII race discrimination claim in Part III.A.4. But first, the Court summarizes in Part III.A.1 the analytical framework applied in discrimination cases.
1. The Analytical Framework
The issue on summary judgment is whether plaintiff has carried his burden of producing evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue as to a material fact on each of his claims. Carter v. Three Springs Residential Treatment, 132 F.3d 635, 641 (11th Cir. 1998). Plaintiff can carry this burden either by producing (1) direct evidence of discrimination motivating the employment decision, (2) circumstantial evidence sufficient to allow an inference of discrimination, or (3) statistical proof of a pattern of discrimination. [*36]  Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1293 n.8 (11th Cir. 1999). Because plaintiff has proffered no direct evidence or statistical proof, he is proceeding with circumstantial evidence.
When analyzing a disparate treatment claim based upon circumstantial evidence, courts use the burden-shifting framework articulated by the Supreme Court. See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993); Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination, which varies slightly depending on the type of claim raised. See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 512, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). Summary judgment against the plaintiff is appropriate if he fails to satisfy any one of the elements of a prima facie case. See Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 135 F.3d 1428, 1433 (11th Cir. 1998).
If plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, an inference of discrimination is raised, and the burden of production then shifts to the defendant to rebut the inference of discrimination by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. This burden is "exceedingly light." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1564 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam). If the defendant meets this light burden, then the inference of discrimination is erased, and the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff "to demonstrate that the defendant's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is a mere pretext for discrimination." Id. at 1565.30 "To avoid summary judgment the plaintiff must [*37]  introduce significantly probative evidence showing that the asserted reason is merely a pretext for discrimination. A reason is not pretext for discrimination unless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason." Brooks v. Cty. Comm'n of Jefferson Cty, Ala., 446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir. 2006) (citations and internal punctuation omitted).

2. Plaintiff's Section 1983 Failure to Promote Claim
In order to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory failure to promote, plaintiff must show "(1) that he is a member of a protected class; (2) that he was qualified for and applied for the promotion; (3) that he was rejected; and (4) that other equally or less qualified employees who were not members of the protected class were promoted." Denney v. City of Albany, 247 F.3d 1172, 1183 (11th Cir. 2001). Plaintiff fails to submit any probative evidence establishing element four. In fact, as discussed supra Part II.S, the County promoted Ms. Searles to the Sewer System Superintendent II position instead of plaintiff in 2013, and she is a member of his protected class.
The County's promotion of an African-American employee to the position sought by plaintiff forecloses any race-based failure to promote claim. See Revere v. McHugh, 362 F. App'x 993, 997 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (African-American plaintiff failed to establish a failure to promote prima [*38]  facie case when another African-American was promoted to the position she had sought); see also Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1089 (11th Cir. 2004) (stating a comparator must be outside the plaintiff's protected class); Martin v. City of Atlanta, Ga., No. 1:07-CV-326-WSD, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119912, 2013 WL 4507074, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 23, 2013) (promotion of person in same protected class as plaintiff to the job he sought defeats failure to promote claim), aff'd, 579 F. App'x 819 (11th Cir. 2014). Plaintiff's failure to establish a prima facie case requires entry of summary judgment for defendant on plaintiff's Section 1983 failure to promote claim. See Turlington, 135 F.3d at 1433.

3. Plaintiff's Title VII Retaliation Claim
In the section of his Response Brief labeled, "Mr. Harrison can prove retaliation," plaintiff points to two events alleged in his June 24, 2009 EEOC charge which he claims were retaliatory. (See Pl.'s Resp. Br. [84], at 20.) This June 24, 2009 EEOC charge states that plaintiff had filed an EEOC charge on May 15, 2009, and then alleges that (1) on June 19, 2009, he received direction from management to keep a log of the times he used the restroom facilities; and (2) he had "also been assigned to perform tasks of a lower level job classification in the field that other co-workers in [his] same position [were] not required to perform." (See Chg. No. 410-2009-04675, [*39]  filed as Belle Dep. Ex. 140 [87-10].)
The Court puts aside for a moment the June 19, 2009 directive that plaintiff keep a log of his bathroom breaks and focuses first on the second alleged retaliatory action, i.e., assigning plaintiff to perform tasks of a lower-level job classification in the field.
A prima facie case of retaliation31 requires a plaintiff to show that: (1) he engaged in an activity protected under Title VII; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir. 2008); Pennington v. City of Huntsville, 261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir. 2001).
Plaintiff engaged in activity protected under Title VII when he filed the May 15, 2009 EEOC charge. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) (prohibiting retaliation against an employee "because he has . . . made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing [thereunder]."); see also Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir. 1999) (filing an EEOC charge is protected activity).32
Assuming that plaintiff could satisfy element two of a prima facie case (i.e., that the assignment to perform tasks of a lower level job classification in the field was an adverse employment action), he cannot show a causal connection [*40]  between his filing of an EEOC charge on May 15, 2009 and any adverse employment action. The undisputed material facts show that plaintiff had been assigned to perform tasks of a lower level job classification in the field long before he filed that EEOC charge.
As noted above, the Work Plan designed by CMOM Manager Tucker assigned plaintiff to field work in late-November 2008. In his grievance dated January 28, 2009, plaintiff wrote, inter alia, that the "new work description is not comparable to the essential job description of my job classification (Superintendent)," and that the "job duties of the new assignment relegate my performing manual labor tasks and not supervisory functions as my primary role." (Browning Dep. Ex. 94 [87-2], at 3.) The remedy plaintiff requested included assignment of work that was "in accordance with [his] essential job duties." (Id.) In sum, because there is no evidence that defendant assigned plaintiff to perform tasks of a lower level job classification in the field in retaliation for his filing of the May 15, 2009, EEOC charge, summary judgment should be entered for defendant on this part of plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim given his failure to [*41]  establish a prima facie case.33
Even if plaintiff's Response Brief had relied on the allegations made in the May 15, 2009 EEOC charge, the undersigned's recommendation would not change. For example, the May 15 charge alleges that plaintiff participated in an internal investigation on behalf of a co-worker who filed both internal and EEOC charges in March 2009, and since that date he had been subjected to different terms and conditions of employment by not being provided appropriate work equipment, denied opportunities for promotion, and on April 26, 2009, assigned different job assignments. (See Chg. No. 410-2009-04014, filed as Belle Dep. Ex. 138 [87-9].)
Plaintiff has submitted no probative evidence showing that he was denied a promotion during this relevant time period. Plaintiff has also submitted no probative evidence showing that his work equipment was inappropriate. But even if he had submitted such evidence, being provided with inappropriate work equipment would not constitute an adverse employment action. (See the following paragraph for a discussion of this concept.) This is especially true when there is no evidence that plaintiff was disciplined for poor performance caused by [*42]  that inappropriate equipment. Finally, as plaintiff explained in his deposition, the date of April 26, 2009 that he inserted in the May 15 EEOC charge was one he arbitrarily selected. (Harrison Dep. [77-3], at 46.) He testified that he had been assigned to perform field work that he believed was below his job classification since "right before the beginning of 2009," i.e., late-2008. (Id. at 46-47.) The bottom line is that the assignment to plaintiff of field work that he believed was beneath his job classification occurred well before he either assisted a co-worker with an EEOC charge in March 2009 or filed his own EEOC charges in May and June 2009. Thus, the assignment to plaintiff of field work that was outside of his job classification could not have been in retaliation for engaging in protected activity.
The Court turns now to plaintiff's claim that, in retaliation for his filing of the May 15, 2009 EEOC charge, he was advised by management on June 19, 2009 to keep a log of the times he used the restroom facilities. As noted above, the second element of a retaliation prima facie case requires the plaintiff to show that he suffered an adverse employment action. To be sure, "not every unkind [*43]  act is sufficiently adverse" to qualify as an adverse employment action and support a retaliation claim. Shotz v. City of Plantation, Fla., 344 F.3d 1161, 1181 (11th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted); see also Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Fla., 245 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir. 2001) ("not all conduct by an employer negatively affecting an employee constitutes adverse employment action" for Title VII purposes). Instead, an employment action meets the above threshold only when it "results in some tangible, negative effect on the plaintiff's employment" through "a serious and material change in the terms, conditions or privileges of employment . . . as viewed by a reasonable person in the circumstances." Shotz, 344 F.3d at 1181-82 (citations omitted); see also Shannon v. Bellsouth Telecomms., 292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir. 2002) (explaining that "some threshold level of substantiality" must be satisfied for conduct to constitute an adverse employment action, inasmuch as not everything that makes an employee unhappy is actionable). To show an "adverse employment action" for Title VII purposes, "the employer's action must impact the terms, conditions or privileges of the plaintiff's job in a real and demonstrable way," and a plaintiff must show that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have viewed it as "a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Davis, 245 F.3d at 1239.
Defendant posits some legitimate [*44]  reasons for asking plaintiff to keep a record of vehicle usage. (See Belle Decl. [75-2] ¶¶ 4-14.) However, for purposes of summary judgment, the Court accepts plaintiff's claim that he was asked to keep a log regarding the times he used the bathroom. However, such a request does not amount to an adverse employment action under the case law cited above. Although the request may have been offensive to plaintiff, no reasonable person in the circumstances would have viewed this request as "a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Davis, 245 F.3d at 1239. Accordingly, summary judgment should be granted to defendant on this part of plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim given his failure to establish a prima facie case.

4. Plaintiff's Title VII Race Discrimination Claim
To establish a prima facie race discrimination claim, plaintiff must show that he (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was subjected to an adverse employment action; (3) was qualified to do the job; and (4) was replaced or otherwise lost a position to a person outside the protected class. Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000). Alternatively, the fourth element may be satisfied if the plaintiff shows that he was treated less favorably [*45]  than similarly situated employees outside the protected class. Maniccia v. Brown, 171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 1999).
The parties dispute element two, i.e., whether plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action. As already shown in the retaliation section, this is a very high threshold for a plaintiff to meet if he is not discharged, demoted, or suspended. Plaintiff complains about the Work Plan, and how it assigned him to perform tasks he considered beneath his job classification, such as manual labor related to removing heavy manhole covers, that his Caucasian counterpart, Mr. Henson, allegedly did not have to perform.
In considering this race discrimination claim, the Court is mindful that an African-American supervisor, CMOM Manager Tucker, assigned the work that Sewer System Superintendents Harrison and Henson performed. It strains credulity to accept plaintiff's contention that Mr. Tucker decided to discriminate against a fellow African American in making those work assignments.
Moreover, plaintiff is simply disputing a work assignment. The Eleventh Circuit has stated that "[w]ork assignment claims strike at the very heart of an employer's business judgment and expertise because they challenge an employer's ability to allocate its [*46]  assets in response to shifting and competing market priorities." Davis, 245 F.3d at 1244. For this reason, "courts [] have been reluctant to hold that changes in job duties amount to adverse employment action when unaccompanied by any tangible harm" such as a reduction in salary. Id.; see also Melton v. Nat'l Dairy LLC, 705 F. Supp. 2d 1303, 1329 (M.D. Ala. 2010) ("Changes in work assignments that do not cause any economic injury to the employee do not constitute adverse employment action.").34
As amply stated already, the changes in plaintiff's job duties wrought by the Work Plan did not amount to an adverse employment action because there was no tangible harm to him, such as a reduction in salary. Mr. Harrison's personal belief that the change in job assignments constituted a "demotion" (see Pl.'s Resp. Br. [84], at 10) is immaterial. See Davis, 245 F.3d at 1239 (employee's subjective view of the significance and adversity of the employer's action is not controlling).
This Court is unwilling to substitute its judgment for that of the County in relation to Mr. Tucker's assignment of job duties to plaintiff and Mr. Henson. See Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir. 1991) (stating "Federal courts 'do not sit as a super-personnel department that reexamines an entity's business decisions.'") (quoting Mechnig v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 864 F.2d 1359, 1365 (7th Cir.1988)). For the same reasons, changes in work [*47]  assignments are not adverse employment actions but rather "an 'ordinary tribulation of the workplace' for which employees should expect to take responsibility." MacLean v. City of St. Petersburg, 194 F. Supp. 2d 1290, 1299 (M.D. Fla. 2002). Therefore, summary judgment should be entered for the County on plaintiff's Title VII race discrimination claim given his failure to establish a prima facie case.

B. Plaintiff's ADA Failure to Accommodate Claim
Plaintiff also alleges that the County failed to accommodate his disability in violation of the ADA. Congress enacted the ADA to provide "a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). Under the ADA, an employer is prohibited from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability" (id. § 12112(a)) by "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business." Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
To state a prima facie claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified [*48]  individual, meaning able to perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) he was discriminated against because of his disability by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation.
Russell v. City of Tampa, 652 Fed. Appx. 765, 2016 WL 3181385, at *2 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam) (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). "[T]he initial burden of requesting an accommodation is on the employee." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999). The undisputed material facts show that, although plaintiff completed an "Understanding and Consent to Proceed" form with the County's Office of Disability Affairs on February 11, 2009, he initialed the line indicating that he "did not want to proceed with the Reasonable Accommodation Process." (See Belle Dep. Ex. 143 [87-11], at 4 (Bates No. FC 002856).) An employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016). Because plaintiff did not make a specific demand for an accommodation, and instead requested that the process not begin, the County's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation was not triggered at that time.35
The record also shows that Mr. Harrison returned to the Office of Disability Affairs on April 20, 2009, and this time indicated that he wanted the reasonable accommodation process [*49]  to begin. (See Belle Dep. Ex. 143 [87-11], at 5 (Bates No. FC 002857).) At this point, the County had an obligation to "'make a reasonable effort to determine the appropriate accommodation.'" Gaston, 167 F.3d at 1364 (quoting 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 App. § 1630.9); see also Melange v. City of Center Line, 482 F. App'x 81, 84-85 (6th Cir. 2012) ("Once the employee requests an accommodation, the employer has a duty to engage in an 'interactive process' to 'identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.") (internal quotation marks omitted).
The undisputed material facts show that the County began that interactive process immediately after receiving that second "Understanding and Consent to Proceed" form. So that it could have information to make a decision, defendant requested information from plaintiff's doctor on April 20, 2009. (See Fax Cover Sheet and attachments from Wayne Stokes to Dr. James Bennett [87-11], at 11-17.) Unfortunately, plaintiff's doctor took a month to respond, not sending over a description of plaintiff's job-related limitations until May 28, 2009. (See Belle Dep. Ex. 143 [87-11], at 24 (Bates No. FC 002876).) Those limitations included a 100-pound lifting restriction and notice that plaintiff [*50]  would need to urinate frequently. (Id.) The County then certified plaintiff as an individual with a disability for purposes of the ADA on June 2, 2009 [85-4], and scheduled an interactive meeting with plaintiff for June 19, 2009, to discuss his need for a reasonable accommodation. (DSUMF ¶ 25; PR-DSUMF ¶ 25.)36 At that meeting, the County assigned an additional employee to plaintiff's team so that he would not have to lift the heavy manhole covers. That was a reasonable accommodation. See McKane v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., 363 F. App'x 679, 681 (11th Cir. 2010) ("An employee with a disability is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation.').
Plaintiff complains that the County took too long to provide reasonable accommodation, making him wait about four months after he first requested accommodation (i.e., from February 11, 2009 to June 2, 2009). (Pl.'s Resp. Br. [84], at 15.) However, as shown above, plaintiff did not give permission to start the reasonable accommodation process on February 11, 2009. He did not grant permission to do so until April 20, 2009. Because the interactive process only begins when an employee requests an accommodation, Bralo v. Spirit Airlines, Inc., No. 13-60948-CIV, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36042, 2014 WL 1092365, at *16 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 19, 2014), and plaintiff did not [*51]  request one until April 20, 2009, the process took only about two months, not four as plaintiff claims.37
Plaintiff also complains that, after the County provided reasonable accommodation (i.e., assigning an employee to lift the manhole covers for him), he still had to perform this type of work. (Pl.'s Resp. Br. [84], at 16.) The undisputed facts show, however, that when Mr. Belle learned on August 21, 2009, that Mr. Harrison had been assisting the maintenance worker assigned to his team to lift manhole covers, he met with Mr. Harrison and told him that he needed to abide by his doctor's lifting restriction. Mr. Harrison's excuse was that the maintenance worker assigned to assist him was incompetent and needed help lifting manhole covers. After this meeting, the County sent plaintiff a memorandum directing him to abide by his physician's lifting restrictions. (See Aug. 26, 2009 Mem. from Stokes to Harrison, filed as Ex. B to Belle Decl. [75-2], at 17.)
If Mr. Harrison elected not to take advantage of the reasonable accommodation provided by continuing to lift heavy manhole covers in violation of the lifting restriction imposed by his doctor, [*52]  then he cannot fault the County. See Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., a Div. of Echlin, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1177 (10th Cir. 1999) (once the employer has offered a reasonable accommodation, its duties under the ADA have been discharged); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(d) ("[I]f such individual rejects a reasonable accommodation, . . . that is necessary to enable the individual to perform the essential functions of the position held or desired, and cannot, as a result of that rejection, perform the essential functions of the position, the individual will not be considered qualified."). Because plaintiff fails to state a prima facie case of failure to accommodate, summary judgment should be entered for defendant on plaintiff's ADA claim.

V. CONCLUSION
As explained above, no genuine disputes as to any material facts remain for trial in this matter. Therefore, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion [75] and Amended Motion [77] for Summary Judgment be GRANTED.
The Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the Magistrate Judge.
SO RECOMMENDED, this 31st day of October, 2016.
