Summary Judgment > Fair Employment and Housing Act
U.S. District Court, Central District of California, granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment, held that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact regarding plaintiff’s claims for relief, when court found that in 2010 plaintiff, employed by defendant as truck driver, accidentally killed pedestrian, which resulted in psychological trauma that disabled plaintiff from ever again driving defendant’s truck, that defendant attempted to accommodate plaintiff in alternative positions with defendant, that, after four years, defendant believed it could no longer continue plaintiff’s temporary assignment because plaintiff had reached maximum medical improvement and because it believed it had no other available positions that plaintiff was qualified to perform or capable of performing, that in 4/2014 defendant decided to terminate plaintiff’s employment, that plaintiff sued defendant, asserting claims for discrimination on basis of disability, failure to provide reasonable [**1161]  accommodations, failure to engage in timely, good faith interactive accommodation process, all in violation of Fair Employment and Housing Act, Gov. Code § 12940 et seq., wrongful termination in violation of public policy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, that defendant carried its initial burden of demonstrating absence of genuine issue of material fact on all of plaintiff’s claims, that plaintiff failed to carry its burden of producing sufficient evidence to create genuine issue of material fact on any of his claims, and that, in addition, plaintiff’s claim alleging defendant’s failure to provide reasonable accommodations must fail, based on doctrine of judicial estoppel, because plaintiff had previously taken position in settlement of his workers’ compensation claim inconsistent with position he now took regarding defendant’s alleged failure to provide reasonable accommodations.

CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: [IN CHAMBERS] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Adelberto Barajas sued his former employer, Defendant Consolidated Disposal Service, L.L.C., for alleged disability discrimination, failure to accommodate a disability, failure to engage in the interactive accommodation process, wrongful termination in violation of public policy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Compl., Dkt. No. 1-1 at 5-12.) This case was filed in the Orange County Superior Court, but Consolidated Disposal removed on the asserted basis of diversity jurisdiction. (Notice of Removal, Dkt. No. 1 at 3-7.) After adequate time for discovery, Consolidated Disposal filed a motion for summary judgment on all of Barajas' claims for relief. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
The Court GRANTS the motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. [*2]  No. 30.) The Court will enter a simple judgment.

1. BRIEF BACKGROUND
The parties have agreed on some salient facts, and the Court accepts that those undisputed representations are accurate. (Compare Def.'s Facts, Dkt. No. 31-1, with Pl.'s Facts, Dkt. No. 34.) The Court's purpose here is only to provide a brief summary.
Plaintiff Barajas began working for Defendant Consolidated Disposal in 1997. Some time in 1997 or 1998, Barajas started driving a commercial trash truck for the company. He was a member of the teamster's union and his employment was governed by various collective bargaining agreements. In December 2010, while driving his route, Barajas backed into and accidentally killed a pedestrian. He began to suffer psychological trauma (later diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder) and, as a result, couldn't drive his truck anymore. Around that time, [**1162]  Barajas also submitted a workers' compensation claim. It appears that Consolidated Disposal attempted to accommodate Barajas for some time. For example, Barajas was given a 10-month paid leave of absence. And on his return, Consolidated Disposal provided Barajas with a temporary assignment—that is, they paid and employed Barajas as [*3]  a commercial driver, yet allowed him to perform the duties of an “assistant swamper,” which is a helper to other drivers. Later on, Barajas received a $120,000 settlement for his psychological disability through the state's workers' compensation system.
But more than three years after the accident, Barajas asserts he still wasn't fully recovered and still couldn't drive his truck. Consolidated Disposal objected to the treating psychologist's conclusions, and, as provided under the workers' compensation laws, sought an evaluation by a neutral psychologist. In February 2014, a certified clinical psychologist conducted a qualified medical evaluation. Among other things, the psychologist concluded that Barajas had reached maximum medical improvement and couldn't be expected to return to his position as a commercial trash truck driver in the near future. Consolidated Disposal believed it could no longer continue Barajas' temporary assignment because he had reached maximum medical improvement. Further, at that time, Consolidated Disposal believed it had no other available positions that Barajas was qualified to perform or capable of performing. Ultimately, in April 2014, Consolidated Disposal [*4]  decided to terminate Barajas' employment.
Barajas asserts the following claims against his former employer: (1) discrimination on the basis of disability, (2) failure provide reasonable accommodations, (3) failure to engage in a timely, good faith interactive accommodation process, all in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”), see Cal. Gov't Code § 12940 et seq.; (4) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress.

2. PRELIMINARY MATTERS

2.1 Violations of the Local Rules
Consolidated Disposal argues that plaintiff's counsel has committed “pervasive violations of the local rules” and has displayed a general “disregard for litigation obligations” throughout these proceedings. (Reply, Dkt. No. 38 at 1 & n.1.) This Court has already noted, in a previous order, that plaintiff's counsel filed an untimely opposition and supporting evidence. See C.D. Cal. L.R. 7-9 (opposing papers). This Court has also explained the potential consequences for filing an untimely opposition. See C.D. Cal. L.R. 7-12 (failure to file required documents). It now appears that plaintiff's counsel has also failed to comply with other important practices and procedures. See C.D. Cal. L.R. 5-4.5  [*5] (submitting mandatory chambers copies), 11-3 (the form and format of documents presented to the Court).
This Court has elsewhere commented the importance of the Local Rules. See Lopez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. SACV 16-01409 AG (KESx), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144380, 2016 WL 6088257, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 17, 2016). Simply [**1163]  put, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Local Rules of the Central District are designed to ensure that litigation proceeds fairly. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 (“[These rules] should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.”); Nelson v. Adams USA, Inc., 529 U.S. 460, 465 [120 S. Ct. 1579, 146 L. Ed. 2d 530] (2000) (“The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are designed to further the due process of law that the Constitution guarantees.”). When the parties flout these provisions with impunity, it “encourages disdain for our rules and penalizes lawyers … who make the effort to comply.” Cf. Cuevas v. Hartley, 835 F.3d 892, 893 (9th Cir. 2016) (Kozinski, J., dissenting). It also might leave the impression that a party isn't interested in this case. The Court encourages all parties to take their obligations seriously.

2.2 Evidentiary Objections
Consolidated Disposal has raised numerous objections to Barajas' statement of “genuine disputes” and “additional uncontroverted facts.” (Reply, Dkt. No. [*6]  38 at 1-2, 13-16.) For example, Consolidated Disposal argues that plaintiff's counsel has provided “no admissible evidence that actually disputes any of the [material] facts” and, in any case, “the purported evidence he offers is irrelevant, misstates testimony or the record, and is speculative or otherwise unsupported by the record.” (Id. at 13.) In ruling on a motion for summary judgment with numerous objections, it's “often unnecessary and impractical for a court to methodically scrutinize each objection and give a full analysis of each argument raised.” See Doe v. Starbucks, Inc., No. SACV 08-00582 AG (CWx), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118878, 2009 WL 5183773, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 18, 2009). This is especially true where, as here, “many of the objections are boilerplate recitations of evidentiary principles or blanket objections without analysis applied to specific items of evidence.” Id.
For present purposes, the Court will limit its discussion to objections that are central to the issues in this case. For example, Consolidated Disposal objects to the declarations of Dr. Barsom and Bardia Peake because these witnesses weren't properly “disclosed” as purported experts, and because plaintiff's counsel failed to provide the required “summary reports” of their testimony. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(A), “a party [*7]  must disclose to the other parties the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705.” Further, this disclosure must state “the subject matter on which the witness is expected to present evidence” and “a summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness is expected to testify.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 (a)(2)(C). The Court agrees that the admission of these declarations as mere “lay testimony” would fly in the face of the important protections of Rule 26(a)(2). Courts may only consider admissible evidence in ruling on a summary judgment motion, see Orr v. Bank of Am., NT & SA, 285 F.3d 764, 773 (9th Cir. 2002), and, at the hearing in this matter, plaintiff's counsel wasn't able to adequately rebut all of Consolidated Disposal's evidentiary objections. The Court declines to rely on evidence that plaintiff's counsel didn't adequately justify.
 [**1164] 

3. LEGAL STANDARD
Plaintiff's counsel frames this case using a summary judgment standard that's similar to California Code of Civil Procedure 437c. (Opp'n, Dkt. No. 36 at 8-9.) For example, citing several California appellate decisions, plaintiff's counsel seems to argue that “[a] plaintiff bears no burden to establish any element of his case unless the defendant presents evidence . . . affirmatively negating that element.” [*8]  (Id. at 8.) But this is a federal court. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 [106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265] (1986) (finding “no express or implied requirement in Rule 56 that the moving party support its motion with affidavits or other similar materials negating the opponent's claim.”). And “federal courts sitting in diversity [must] apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.” Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 427 [116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659] (1996). It follows that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern “the procedural aspects of summary judgment” in this diversity case. See Caesar Elecs. Inc. v. Andrews, 905 F.2d 287, 290 n.3 (9th Cir. 1990).
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), summary judgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” A motion for summary judgment is designed to “prevent vexation and delay, improve the machinery of justice, promote the expeditious disposition of cases, and avoid unnecessary trials when no genuine issues of fact have been raised.” 10A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2712, p. 236-38 (4th ed. 2016). The essential inquiry for the Court is “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.” See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 [106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202] (1986). At this stage, the Court must view the facts and draw all reasonable [*9]  inferences “in the light most favorable to the party opposing the [summary judgment] motion.” Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 [127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686] (2007). The initial burden is on the moving party to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. But if the moving party carries that burden, then the nonmoving party must produce enough evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact. Id. at 322-23.

4. ANALYSIS
Consolidated Disposal says the undisputed evidence shows that it's entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all of Barajas' claims for relief, or, at the very least, some of his claims for damages. Plaintiff's counsel, in turn, filed an opposition brief contains insufficient citations to admissible evidence. As the Ninth Circuit has said, “[t]he district court need not examine the entire file for evidence establishing a genuine issue of fact, where the evidence is not set forth in the opposing papers with adequate references so that it could conveniently be found.” Carmen v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 2001); see also Forsberg v. Pac. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 840 F.2d 1409, 1418 (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that a district court is “not required to comb the record to find some [**1165]  reason to deny a motion for summary judgment”). After a full hearing and in this matter, plaintiff's counsel was still unable to connect his legal arguments with the purported evidence [*10]  in his opposition papers. See United States v. Dunkel, 927 F.2d 955, 956 (7th Cir. 1991) (“Judges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in briefs.”). With that view of the record, the Court turns to the merits.

4.1 Disability Discrimination Claim
Under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act, see Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a), it's unlawful “[f]or an employer, because of the … physical disability, mental disability, [or] medical condition … of any person, … to discharge the person from employment … or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.” Although the FEHA prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of a disability, it specifically limits the reach of that proscription for any person who “is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations.” See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(1). The California Supreme Court has recognized that FEHA allows the discharge of an employee with a disability “when that employee is unable to perform the essential duties of the job even with reasonable accommodation.” See Green v. State, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 257 [64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118] (2007).
Relying on FEHA's express terms, Consolidated Disposal points to record evidence showing that Barajas was unable to perform the essential duties of his job, i.e., drive a trash [*11]  truck, even with reasonable accommodations. For example, in February 2014, Barajas chose a certified clinical psychologist to conduct a qualified medical evaluation under the state workers' compensation system. (Barajas Decl., Dkt. No. 32-5 at 54-5; QME Appointment Form, Dkt. No. 32-6, Ex. 12.) After performing the evaluation, that psychologist wrote a 49-page report on the status of Barajas' psychological condition. The extensive report ultimately concluded that Barajas had reached “maximum medical improvement,” stated that he couldn't be expected to “return to his usual and customary occupation as a commercial [or] residential truck driver,” and imposed 15 minute/hour break restrictions and a 40 hour/week work restriction. (QME Report, Dkt. No. 32-7, Ex. 13 at 47-49.) These facts sufficiently show that, at the time he was terminated, Barajas wasn't a “qualified individual under the FEHA” because he couldn't “perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.” See Green, 42 Cal. 4th at 260.
Barajas doesn't cite any evidence, or raise a genuine dispute of material fact in response. (Compare Mot. for Summary J., Dkt. No. 31 at 7-8, with Opp'n, Dkt. No. 36 at 9-10, and Reply, [*12]  Dkt. No. 38 at 3.) Instead, Barajas simply asserts that “he could fully perform the essential . . . functions of [a] helper job or other jobs, other than driving a trash truck.” (Opp'n, Dkt. No. 36 at 10.) That appears to constitute a concession that he was, more than three years after the fatal accident, still unable to drive his truck. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (noting that Rule 56 “permits a proper summary judgment motion to be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves”).
 [**1166] 

4.2 Reasonable Accommodation Claim
Barajas argues that Consolidated Disposal violated the FEHA by failing to accommodate his disability. Under California Government Code § 12940(m)(1), it's unlawful for an employer to “fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an . . . employee.” A reasonable accommodation may include “[j]ob restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, … and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.” Cal. Govt. Code § 12926(p)(2).
But the FEHA doesn't entitle an employee to choose the best accommodation, or a specific accommodation—it only entitles the employee to a reasonable [*13]  accommodation. See Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1222 [37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899] (2006). Further, the obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation for a disabled employee doesn't require an employer to create a new job, move another employee, promote the employee, or violate the rights of another employee under a collective bargaining agreement. See Hastings v. Dep't of Corr., 110 Cal. App. 4th 963, 972 [2 Cal. Rptr. 3d 329] (2003). The employer may prevail on a motion for summary judgment by showing that “there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation.” Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263 [102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55] (2000).
With that framework in mind, Consolidated Disposal argues that there weren't any available positions in the company that Barajas was qualified to perform, or capable of performing with or without an accommodation. (Mot. for Summary J., Dkt. No. 31 at 8.) Barajas' primary response seems to be that his medical restrictions were inaccurate, or that the qualified medical evaluation was simply a pretext for denying reasonable accommodations. (Opp'n, Dkt. No. 36 at 12-23.)
For starters, Consolidated Disposal argues that Barajas should be judicially estopped from challenging the restrictions found in his qualified medical evaluation. [*14]  As courts have long recognized, the doctrine of judicial estoppel “protects the integrity of the judicial process” by preventing “a party from asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a previous proceeding.” See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749 [121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968] (2001). Although there isn't an “exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel,” courts generally consider the following factors: (1) whether a party's current position is clearly inconsistent with its previous position; (2) whether the party has succeeded in a previous proceeding based on it's earlier position; and (3) whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would reap an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party. See id. at 750-51.
Here, it's undisputed that Barajas was awarded $120,000 to settle his disability claims through workers' compensation. (Compromise & Release, Dkt. No. 32-8, Ex. 18 at 6.) As part of that agreement, which bears his hand-written initials, [**1167]  Barajas agreed to settle certain disputes “to avoid the costs, hazards, and delays of further litigation.” (Id. at 7.) And one of those settled matters was the issue of his “permanent disability” based on the [*15]  qualified medical evaluation just discussed. (Id.) Despite his workers' compensation settlement, Barajas now supports his reasonable accommodation claim by arguing that he “never accepted” those restrictions and that he “didn't need those restrictions.” (Opp'n, Dkt. No. 36 at 10.) But the record suggests otherwise, and Barajas hasn't sufficiently explained how his previous representations can be squared with his current litigation position. Both the Ninth Circuit and the California Court of Appeal have applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel in similar circumstances. See Rissetto v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 343, 94 F.3d 597, 606 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that judicial estoppel barred plaintiff's claims under the FEHA, where she had received workers' compensation benefits for temporary total disability); see also Jackson v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 60 Cal. App. 4th 171, 189 [70 Cal. Rptr. 2d 96] (1997). The Court concludes, based on the factors just discussed, that judicial estoppel is appropriate here.
At any rate, Consolidated Disposal has shown that, even if Barajas were somehow able to contest the restrictions found in the qualified medical evaluation, there was still no open position that he was capable of performing, or qualified to perform, during the relevant time period. (Mot. for Summary J., Dkt. No. 31 at 9-15; see also Castro Decl., [*16]  Dkt. No. 32-1 at 4-6.) Barajas hasn't offered any admissible, competent evidence to the contrary. Instead, he variously asserts, without adequately citing to the record, that Consolidated Disposal should have made his temporary position permanent, demoted him to a lower position, reassigned him to some other position, or given him an indefinite leave of absence. (Opp'n, Dkt. No. 36 at 15-19.) But the law doesn't require an employer to go to such lengths, particularly where it may violate the rights of other employees or a collective bargaining agreement. See Hastings, 110 Cal. App. 4th at 972.

4.3 Interactive Process Claim
Barajas argues that Consolidated Disposal violated the FEHA by failing to engage in the “interactive process.” Under California Government Code § 12940(n), it's unlawful for an employer to “fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability.” But “[t]o prevail on a claim … for failure to engage in the interactive process, an employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive [*17]  process should have occurred.” Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1018 [93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338] (2009). The FEHA doesn't impose liability for failure to engage in the interactive process when no reasonable accommodation is possible. See Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 980-81 [83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190] (2008). Months after the close of discovery, Barajas still hasn't provided any admissible evidence showing that there was an available position that he could have performed, that there was an available position that he could have been given, or [**1168]  that there was some other reasonable accommodation at the time the interactive dialogue should have occurred. (Compare Mot. for Summary J., Dkt. No. 31 at 12-14, with Opp'n, Dkt. No. 36 at 12-19, and Reply, Dkt. No. 38 at 10-12.)

4.4 Wrongful Termination Claim
The parties seem to agree that Barajas' claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy is dependent on his claims under the FEHA. (Compare Mot. for Summary J., Dkt. No. 31 at 17, with Opp'n, Dkt. No. 36 at 23-24.) It follows that, because the plaintiff's “FEHA claims fail[], his claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy [also] fails.” See Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 229 [87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487] (1999).

4.5 Emotional Distress Claim
Under California law, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress has three elements. See Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal. 4th 1035, 1050 [95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963] (2009). First, the defendant must engage [*18]  in “extreme and outrageous conduct” intending to cause, or recklessly disregarding the chance of causing, emotion distress. Second, the plaintiff must suffer “severe or extreme emotional distress.” And third, the defendant's “outrageous conduct” must be the “actual and proximate” cause of the plaintiff's emotional distress. Id. (internal citations and quotations omitted). Further, as the California Supreme Court has held, a defendant's conduct is only considered “outrageous” if it is “so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.” Id. at 1050-51 (internal quotation marks omitted). The state courts have set a “high bar” for this intentional tort. Id. at 1051.
Consolidated Disposal says that there's no dispute regarding the relevant facts and, then suggests that it's entitled to judgment as a matter of law for several reasons. Here, both sides seem to agree that Consolidated Disposal attempted to accommodate Barajas for several years. For example, Consolidated provided Barajas with a 10-month leave of absence, and then continued to employ and pay him as a commercial driver, even though he performed the lesser duties of an assistant or helper. (Mot. for Summary J., Dkt. [*19]  No. 31 at 17.) It's true that Barajas was ultimately terminated when, after several years of treatment, he couldn't return to driving a trash truck. (Opp'n, Dkt. No. 35 at 24.) But even if the decision to fire Barajas was insensitive or rude, this case doesn't involve “extreme and outrageous conduct that exceeded the bounds of what is generally tolerated in a civilized society.” See Braunling v. Countrywide Home Loans Inc., 220 F.3d 1154, 1158 (9th Cir. 2000). Indeed, both state and federal courts have held that “[t]erminating an employee for improper or discriminatory reasons, like many other adverse personnel management decisions, is insufficiently extreme or outrageous to give rise to a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.” See Walker v. Boeing Corp., 218 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1190 (C.D. Cal. 2002) (citing Janken v. GM Hughes Elecs., 46 Cal. App. 4th 55, 80-81 [53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741] (1996)).
 [**1169] 
Barajas hasn't cited any contrary case law, provided any evidence, or created a genuine dispute of material fact. Barajas simply says that he can “maintain” a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Opp'n, Dkt. No. 36 at 24.) His argument on that point is as follows: “Defendant's conduct in terminating his employment after 17 years of faithful service because of admitted[ly] nonsensical restrictions, summarily terminating Plaintiff without dialogue, rises to level of extreme conduct that exceeds all bounds of [*20]  that usually tolerated in a civilized community.” (Id.) The Court disagrees and, instead, concludes that the management decisions at issue here weren't sufficiently extreme or outrageous. See Hughes, 46 Cal. 4th at 1050-51; see also Walker, 218 F. Supp. 2d at 1190.

5. DISPOSITION
The Court concludes, with the admissible and properly presented evidence in this case, that there's no genuine dispute as to any material fact regarding Barajas' claims for relief, and that Consolidated Disposal is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). As such, the Court need not discuss Consolidated Disposal's arguments concerning damages.
For these reasons, the Court GRANTS the motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 30.) The Court will enter a simple judgment.

JUDGMENT
The Court enters judgment for Defendant and against Plaintiff.
