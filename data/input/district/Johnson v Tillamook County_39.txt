FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATION
PAPAK, Magistrate Judge: [*2] 
Plaintiff Tracy Johnson brings this action against defendants Tillamook County (the "County"), Jenny Moberg, and Deputies Bobby Lundy, Traci Hillstrom, Victor Gutierrez, Brad Rohde, Rachel Brantner, Brett Dye, and Glen Watson (collectively, the "Deputy Defendants"). Johnson asserts four Claims for Relief. Through his First Claim for Relief, Johnson alleges that Moberg and the Deputy Defendants subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of his rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See Am. Compl. 10-14 (#11). Through his Second Claim for Relief, Johnson alleges that the County's custom, policy, and practice caused his Eighth Amendment rights to be violated. See id. at ¶¶ 15-19. Through his Third Claim for Relief, Johnson alleges that the County and the Deputy Defendants violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") by failing to make reasonable accommodations for his disability. See id. at 20-26. Finally, through his Fourth Claim for Relief, Johnson alleges that the County was negligent in failing to ensure his health and safety. See id. at ¶¶ 27-31.
Now before the court is Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (#47). Defendants move for summary judgment on each of Johnson's claims and, alternatively, [*3]  for partial summary judgment on Johnson's prayer for damages for lost wages. For the reasons provided below, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment should be granted in part and denied in part.

BACKGROUND1
Johnson was diagnosed with porphyria cutanea tarda ("PCT") in November of 2009. Johnson Decl. ¶ 2, Ex, 1 — Ex. 3 (#56). PCT is a condition that causes skin to painfully blister when exposed to florescent light. Id. At all relevant times, only the tops of Johnson's hands and feet were susceptible to PCT symptoms. Id. at ¶ 2, Ex. 1.
On December 1, 2013, Johnson pleaded guilty to DUII in Tillamook County Court. Id. at ¶ 3. Consequently, he was ordered to serve two days in the Tillamook County Jail. Id. Johnson arrived at the jail at 9:50 a.m. on February 28, 2014 to begin serving his sentence. Engle Decl. Ex. 2, at 5 (#57).2 Upon arrival, Johnson provided the jail with medical documentation of his PCT and latex gloves that he brought to protect his hands. Johnson Decl. 4 (#56). Johnson was initially placed in [*4]  cell 905, which had little to no lighting. Id.; Hillstrom Decl. 8 (#49); Warren Decl. Ex. 1, at 28 (#51-1). After approximately one to two hours, Johnson was moved to cell 903, where he served the remainder of his sentence. Johnson Decl. ¶ 4 (#56); Hillstrom Decl. ¶ 8 (#49). The parties dispute the level of florescent light that was present in cell 903. Johnson contends that he was exposed to "full florescent light" in the cell. Johnson Decl. ¶ 4 (#56). He further contends that, at times, the other cells were reduced to low light, but cell 903 never was. Id. Conversely, Defendants contend that the lights in cell 903 were dimmed for the entirety of Johnson's sentence. Hillstrom Decl. 8-9 (#49); Lundy Decl. ¶¶ 2, 4 (#48). It is undisputed that the lights in cell 903 were never completely turned off. Lundy Decl. ¶¶ 3-4 (#48).
Defendant Moberg worked as the jail's only nurse during Johnson's sentence. She arrived for her shift at the jail at 3:19 p.m. on February 28, 2014. See Engle Decl. Ex. 2, 8 (#57). Defendant [*5]  Hillstrom then informed Moberg about Johnson's condition. Id. Ex. 1, at 56-57. Moberg immediately determined that Johnson needed to be released early because the jail lacked the medical capacity to care for him. Id. Ex. 1, at 64-68. Moberg informed all of the Deputy Defendants about the recommended release, but they did not heed her recommendation. See id. Ex. 1, at 72-74 (Moberg testifying that she told all the deputies that were working on February 28, 2014 that Johnson needed to be released); id. Ex. 2, at 3-4, 8-9, 12 (Officer Activity Log showing that all of the Deputy Defendants were working on February 28, 2014).
Johnson was not permitted to wear his latex gloves or any other gloves during his sentence. See Johnson Decl. 6-7 (#56). Johnson attempted to cover his hands with his clothes and blanket. Id. at ¶ 5. However, he occasionally inadvertently removed his hands from their covering when he fell asleep. Id. Johnson asked multiple deputies for gloves and for the lights in his cell to be dimmed, but those requests went unanswered. Id. at ¶ 6. At approximately 7:00 a.m. on March 1, 2014, the second day of Johnson's sentence, Deputy Dye provided Johnson with an extra pair of socks [*6]  to cover his hands. Id. Johnson was released from the jail at 9:10 a.m. that same day. Engle Decl. Ex. 2, at 16 (#57). Although Johnson was released approximately one day early, Defendants admit that the early release was due to overcrowding and security concerns—not Johnson's medical condition. Lundy Decl. ¶ 5 (#48).
Upon being released, Johnson had blisters on the backs of his hands that he recognized to be caused by exposure to florescent light. Johnson Deck ¶ 9 (#56). The blisters turned to painful sores and scabs that lasted for months. Id. As a result, Johnson underwent months of bloodletting to alleviate the sores. Id. This suit followed.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Warren v. City of Carlsbad, 58 F.3d 439, 441 (9th Cir. 1995). A factual dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. The substantive law governing a claim or defense determines which facts are material. See Moreland v. Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep't, 159 F.3d 365, 369 (9th Cir. 1998). In adjudicating a motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party [*7]  and may neither make credibility determinations nor weigh evidence. See, e.g., Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 494 U.S. 545, 554-55, 110 S. Ct. 1331, 108 L. Ed. 2d 504 (1990).

DISCUSSION

I. Eighth Amendment Claims
Through his First Claim for Relief, Johnson alleges that Defendants violated his Eighth Amendment rights by acting with deliberate indifference to his medical need to avoid exposure to florescent light. See Am. Compl. 10-14 (#11). Through his Second Claim for Relief, Johnson alleges that the County's custom, policy, and practice caused his Eighth Amendment rights to be violated. See id. at ¶¶ 15-19.
For the reasons provided below, Moberg is entitled to summary judgment on Johnson's First Claim for Relief, Genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on the remainder of Johnson's First Claim for Relief. Genuine issues of material fact also preclude summary judgment on Johnson's Second Claim for Relief.

A. Legal Standard
Jail officials violate the Eighth Amendment when they act with "deliberate indifference" to an inmate's serious medical needs. See, e.g., Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 828, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994). To establish an Eighth Amendment violation, a plaintiff must satisfy both an objective standard and a subjective standard. Colwell v. Bannister, 763 F.3d 1060, 1066 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Snow v. McDaniel, 681 F.3d 978, 985 (9th Cir. 2012), overruled on other grounds by, Peralta v. Dillard, 744 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2014)). The objective standard is satisfied by the existence of a "serious medical need." Id. (citing Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976)).
The subjective standard [*8]  is satisfied when a jail official "knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health." Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837; accord Colwell, 763 F.3d at 1066 (citations omitted), That state of mind is otherwise known as "subjective recklessness." Johnson v. Corizon Health, Inc., No. 6:13-CV-1855-TC, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44638, 2015 WL 1549257, at *15 (D. Or. Apr. 6, 2015) (citing Snow, 681 F.3d at 985-86). It may be established by showing "a purposeful act or failure to respond to a prisoner's pain or possible medical need and . . . harm caused by the indifference."3 Jett v. Penner, 439 F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). Although the subjective standard "contains a heightened foreseeability requirement, this requirement differs from the traditional negligence foreseeability requirement only insofar as deliberate indifference requires the defendant to be subjectively aware that serious harm is likely to result from a failure to provide medical care." Gibson v. Cty. of Washoe, Nev., 290 F.3d 1175, 1193 (9th Cir. 2002).

B. Analysis
Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment on Johnson's Eighth Amendment claims because (1) Johnson's PCT was not a serious medical condition, (2) Defendants did not act with deliberate indifference, and (3) Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, I address each issue, in turn, [*9]  below.

1. The Objective Standard—Serious Medical Need
Defendants argue that Johnson's PCT was not a serious medical condition because it had been asymptomatic since 2009. I disagree.
"A medical need is serious if failure to treat it will result in significant injury or the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain." Peralta, 744 F.3d at 1081 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, a serious medical need may be established by evidence of "an injury that a reasonable doctor or patient would find important and worthy of comment or treatment; the presence of a medical condition that significantly affects an individual's daily activities; or the existence of chronic and substantial pain.'" Colwell, 763 F.3d at 1066 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, Johnson testified that he sustained blisters that felt like "boiling water being dripped on [his] hands all of the time" as a result of the fluorescent light exposure he endured during his sentence. Johnson Decl ¶ 9 (#56). That pain lasted for approximately eight to nine months. Id. Johnson further testified that his injuries could have been avoided if defendants had provided him with adequate protection for his hands, such as gloves. See [*10]  id. ¶¶ 2, 5, 6-7. The jail's policy permitted inmates to wear gloves. See Warren Decl. Ex. 1, at 35 (#51-1); Dye Decl. ¶ 5 (#50). Jail policy also apparently permitted the issuance of an additional pair of socks that Johnson could use to cover his hands. See Dye Decl. ¶¶ 4-5 (#50). Deputy Dye provided Johnson a second pair of socks for that reason, but only after Johnson had endured approximately 19 hours of continuous exposure to florescent light. See Engle Decl. Ex. 2, at 5, 13 (#57) (showing Johnson being booked at 9:50 a.m. on February 28, 2014 and receiving an additional pair of socks at 6:07 a.m. on March 1, 2014); Johnson Decl. ¶ 4 (#56) (Johnson admitting that he was kept in a room with no lights for the first one to two hours of his sentence). On these facts, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Defendants' failure to treat or accommodate Johnson's PCT resulted in a significant injury that caused "chronic and substantial pain," the infliction of which was "unnecessary and wanton." See Colwell, 763 F.3d at 1066 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted); Peralta, 744 F.3d at 1081 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Johnson has also presented medical documentation of his PCT diagnosis and [*11]  treatment. Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 4, 9-10, Ex. 1 - Ex. 3 (#56). Therefore, a reasonable trier of fact could also find that Johnson suffered "an injury that a reasonable doctor or patient would find important and worthy of comment or treatment." Colwell, 763 F.3d at 1066 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Defendants' argument regarding Johnson's PCT being asymptomatic since 2009 is unavailing. Johnson submitted a letter from his doctor stating that Johnson experiences "very few outbreaks due to his vigilance at protecting his skin," Johnson Decl. Ex. 1 (#56). Johnson's prior successful manage of his PCT does not preclude a finding that Defendants acted with deliberate indifference by prohibiting Johnson to continue to effectively manage the condition during his sentence. Johnson has generated genuine issues of material fact as to whether his PCT constituted a serious medical condition.

2. The Subjective Standard—Deliberate Indifference
Defendants next argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Johnson's Eighth Amendment claim because he cannot establish that any of them acted with deliberate indifference. In support, Defendants note that PCT is a rare condition that none of them were familiar with. Defendants [*12]  further contend that their attempts to accommodate Johnson's PCT preclude a finding of deliberate indifference. I disagree.

a. The Deputy Defendants
A reasonable trier of fact could find that the Deputy Defendants acted with deliberate indifference. Hillstrom booked Johnson when he arrived at the jail at approximately 10:00 a.m. Hillstrom Decl. ¶ 7 (#49). Johnson informed Hillstrom of his condition and requested to wear latex gloves that he had brought with him. See id.; Johnson Decl. ¶ 4 (#56). Hillstrom did not permit Johnson to wear the latex gloves or any other gloves. Hillstrom Decl. ¶ 7 (#49); Johnson Decl. ¶ 7 (#56). Hillstrom admits that Johnson could have worn the jail's gloves upon obtaining approval from Moberg. Hillstrom Decl. ¶ 7 (#49). However, Moberg was not at the jail when Johnson was booked, and nobody called her even though she was on-call and regularly received calls about inmates' medical conditions. See Engle Decl. Ex. 1, at 24-25, 29, 46, 60, Ex. 2, at 5, 8 (#57). Moberg did not arrive at the jail that day until 3:19 p.m.—at which point Johnson had been held under florescent light for approximately four hours. See id., Ex. 2, at 5, 8 (showing Johnson booked at [*13]  9:50 a.m. and Moberg on duty at 3:19 p.m.); Johnson Decl. ¶ 4 (#56) (Johnson admitting that he was kept in a room with no lights for the first one to two hours of his sentence).
At some point after Moberg arrived at the jail, Hillstrom contacted her about Johnson. Engle Decl. Ex. 1, at 56-57 (#57). "Within a minute of hearing about him," Moberg determined that Johnson needed to be released early because the jail lacked the medical capacity to care for him. Id. Ex. 1, at 64-68. Moberg immediately informed Hillstrom of the recommended release, and less than 30 minutes later, she provided that same recommendation to the other Deputy Defendants. See id. Ex. 1, at 72-74 (Moberg testifying that she told all the deputies that were working on February 28, 2014 that Johnson needed to be released); id. Ex. 2, at 3-4, 8-9, 12 (Officer Activity Log showing that all of the Deputy Defendants were working on February 28, 2014).
Moberg had the authority to recommend early release of inmates for medical conditions. Id. Ex. 1, at 67. When an inmate's charges would not permit early release, she could recommend a transfer to a different facility.4 Engle Decl. Ex. 1, at 67 (#57). However, Moberg rarely made [*14]  such recommendations. Id. In fact, she recommended early release on only two other occasions during the entire time she worked at the jail. Id. Ex. 1, at 68. Incidentally, one of the other occasions was that same day, when Moberg determined that the jail could not care for an inmate who had stage four cancer. Id. Ex. 1, at 67, 69-70. The cancer patient inmate was released on February 28, 2014. Id. Ex. 1, at 80-81. Although the parties have not provided the exact time that inmate was released, it is reasonable to infer that it was at or before 8:28 p.m., as that was the last release recorded on the jail's Officer Activity Log for the day. Id. Ex, 2, at 10. Moberg made the same recommendation for Johnson that she made for the cancer patient inmate. Id. Ex. 1, at 81. However, the Deputy Defendants ignored Moberg's recommendation regarding Johnson.
Johnson was not released until 9:10 a.m. the following day, March 1, 2014. Id. Ex. 2, at 16. Although Johnson was released one day [*15]  early, it was on the basis of security and overcrowding concerns—not his medical condition. Lundy Decl. ¶ 5 (#48). Indeed, there is no evidence that any of the deputies took any action to secure Johnson's release pursuant to Moberg's recommendation. Cf. Engle Decl. Ex. 2 (#57) (Officer Activity Log). Because Johnson was not released on February 28, 2014 on account of his medical condition but the cancer patient was, it is reasonable to infer that the Deputy Defendants ignored Moberg's recommendation. It is also reasonable to infer that the Deputy Defendants understood the importance of that recommendation because it was given by a medical professional who rarely recommended early release. Thus, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the Deputy Defendants acted with deliberate indifference when they ignored Moberg's medical recommendation. See Wakefield v. Thompson, 177 F.3d 1160, 1165 & n. 6 (9th Cir.1999) ("a prison official acts with deliberate indifference when he ignores the instructions of the prisoner's treating physician or surgeon."); Cf. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844 (holding that prison officials may avoid liability if they respond reasonably to the risk of harm).
Moreover, Johnson testified that every time a deputy walked by his cell or offered him [*16]  food, he would summon them for help but was ignored. Johnson Decl. ¶ 6 (#56). The Officer Activity Log shows that all of the Deputy Defendants other than Rhode offered Johnson food and walked by his cell to perform visual checks. See Engle Decl. Ex. 2, at 5-15 (#57). A reasonable trier of fact could therefore also find that defendants Lundy, Hillstrom, Gutierrez, Brantner, Dye and Watson acted with deliberate indifference by ignoring Johnson's direct requests for medical help.5 See Jett, 439 F.3d at 1096 (Deliberate indifference may be established by showing "a purposeful act or failure to respond to a prisoner's pain or possible medical need and . . . harm caused by the indifference." (citation omitted)).
I reject the Deputy Defendants' arguments that the rarity of Johnson's medical condition and their purported attempts to accommodate the condition preclude a finding of deliberate indifference. The rarity of PCT is relevant only to the extent it establishes that the Deputy Defendants did not knowingly disregard a serious risk to Johnson's health. See Colwell, 763 F.3d at 1066 (discussing the elements of an Eighth Amendment claim), However, it is undisputed that the Deputy Defendants knew that Johnson's skin could not be exposed to florescent light for medical reasons. See Engle Decl. Ex. 1, at 72-74 (#57) (Moberg testifying that she told all the deputies that were working on February 28, 2014 that Johnson needed to be released); id. Ex. 2, at 3-4, 8-9, 12 (Officer Activity [*18]  Log showing that all of the Deputy Defendants were working on February 28, 2014); Johnson Decl. ¶ 4 (#56) (Johnson testifying that he provided his medical records to the jail), Therefore, notwithstanding the purported rarity of PCT, a reasonable trier of fact could find that the Deputy Defendants acted with deliberate indifference.
Nor do the Deputy Defendants' purported attempts to accommodate Johnson's PCT preclude a finding of deliberate indifference, In support of their argument to the contrary, Defendants contend that they provided Johnson with a blanket, mattress, and pillow, all of which he could have used to cover his hands. Defendants further contend that Dye provided Johnson with an additional pair of socks on the second day of his sentence so he could cover his hands. Defendants also appear to argue, in passing, that Johnson could have covered his hands with the socks that he wore on his feet for the entirety of his sentence. None of those purported accommodations preclude a finding of deliberate indifference.
A plaintiff "need not prove that he was completely denied medical care" in order to prevail on an Eighth Amendment claim. Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1132 (9th Cir. 2000). Rather, a plaintiff can prevail on an Eighth Amendment claim by showing that [*19]  the defendants were deliberately indifferent in the manner in which they provided medical care. Colwell, 763 F.3d at 1066 (citing Hutchinson v. United States, 838 F.2d 390, 394 (9th Cir. 1988)). In deciding whether jail officials acted with deliberate indifference, the court owes no deference to the officials' judgments regarding the manner of treatment. Id. (citing Hunt v. Dental Dep't, 865 F.2d 198, 200 (9th Cir. 1989)). Johnson testified that the mattress, blanket, and pillow did not sufficiently protect his hands because when he fell asleep, he would inadvertently remove his hands from the limited cover those items provided. Johnson Decl. ¶ 5 (#56). Drawing all reasonable inferences in Johnson's favor, a trier of fact could find that the Deputy Defendants acted with deliberate indifferences by giving Johnson nothing more than standard bedding in response to his PCT.
Nor is summary judgment warranted on the basis of Dye providing Johnson an additional pair of socks on the second day of his sentence. A reasonable trier of fact could find that Dye gave Johnson the additional pair of socks only after the Deputy Defendants ignored Moberg's medical recommendations and Johnson's requests for help. See Engle Decl. Ex.1, at 57, 63-64, 66, 73 (#57) (Moberg testifying that she informed all of the Deputy Defendants on February 28, [*20]  2014 that Johnson needed to be released); id. Ex. 2, at 12 (showing that Dye provided the additional socks at 6:07 a.m. on March 1, 2014, after the Deputy Defendants had already passed Johnson's cell several time). Because Johnson can establish deliberate indifference by showing that the Deputy Defendants delayed his medical treatment or care, the additional pair of socks does not warrant summary judgment. See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104; Colwell, 763 F.3d at 1066 (quoting Hutchinson, 838 F.2d at 394).
Finally, the parties genuinely dispute whether the Johnson's feet are affected by PCT. Johnson provided the following testimony at his June 4, 2015 deposition:
Q. Does [the] fluorescent lighting bother you as we're sitting here today?
A. [Not as] long as I have my hands under the table.
Q. But you're not covering your face. Do you need to cover your skin around your face?
A. No.
Q. Is it just your extremities, your hands and your feet?
A. Just the tops of my hands.
Q. Just the hands?
A. Mm-hm.
Q. Yes?
A. Yes.
Q. But your feet, you don't typically have any problems with your feet and PCT?
A. No.
Warren Decl. Ex. 1, at 7-8 (#51-1). Subsequently, Johnson provided affidavit testimony that his PCT does affect the tops of his feet. Johnson Decl. ¶ 2 (#56). Defendants correctly note [*21]  that Johnson cannot generate a genuine issue of material fact by contradicting his prior sworn testimony, See Nelson v. City of Davis, 571 F.3d 924, 927 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Kennedy v. Allied Mat. Ins. Co., 952 F.2d 262, 266 (9th Cir. 1991)). However, Johnson's affidavit testimony is not contradictory, Johnson merely testified at deposition that the light in the deposition room was not bothering his feet and that he typically does not experience PCT problems with his feet. Warren Decl. Ex. 1, at 7-8 (#51-1) (emphasis added). When read in conjunction with the letter from Johnson's physician stating that Johnson experiences "very few outbreaks due to his vigilance at protecting his skin," it is reasonable to interpret Johnson's deposition testimony as stating that he typically does not have PCT symptoms on his feet because he keeps them covered. See Johnson Decl. Ex. 1 (#56).
More important, the letter from Johnson's physician also affirmatively states that Johnson's feet are affected by his PCT. See id. Johnson's physician executed that letter on January 14, 2014 (before Johnson began serving his sentence). Id. Regardless of whether the statements in the letter were based on the physician's own observations or Johnson's subjective reporting, they clearly preceded Johnson's June 2015 deposition testimony. [*22]  Consequently, even absent Johnson's affidavit testimony, there is still a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Johnson's feet are affected by PCT. A reasonable trier of fact could therefore find that Johnson was unable to use the socks he wore on his feet to cover his hands during his sentence.

b. Defendant Moberg
Conversely, a reasonable trier of fact could not find that Moberg acted with deliberate indifference. Johnson claims that Moberg violated his Eighth Amendment rights by failing to examine him or provide him with protective covering for his skin. However, in order to prevail on that claim, Johnson would have to show that Moberg (1) knew that her inaction created a substantial risk of serious harm to Johnson and (2) disregarded that risk. See, e.g., Gibson, 290 F.3d at 1188 (citations omitted). Johnson has failed to present any evidence to that effect.
To the contrary, Moberg immediately responded to the risk to Johnson's health by instructing Hillstrom to secure his early release. Engle Decl. Ex. 1, at 64-68, 86 (#57). Less than 30 minutes later, she relayed that same instruction to all the other deputies on duty. Id. Ex. 1, at 73. Moberg also separately instructed two of the deputies to give Johnson gloves [*23]  and "whatever he needs" to cover himself while he was waiting to be released. Id. Ex. 1, at 82-83. Moberg believed that the best treatment she could give Johnson was recommending his immediate release, Id. Ex. 1, at 66. Indeed, Moberg's ability to eliminate the risk to Johnson's health was limited by her role in the jail. She could not actually release inmates early. Id. Ex. 1, at 66-67, 80; Lundy Decl. ¶ 5 (#48). Nor could she actually provide inmates with gloves. See Engle Decl. Ex. 1, at 82-83 (#57) (Moberg testifying that she could authorize gloves, but the guards had to actually issue them because of contraband concerns). Rather, she was only able to recommend early release and authorize the use of gloves. Id. Ex. 1, at 66-67, 80, 82-83. That is exactly what she did. Therefore, Moberg reasonably responded to the risk to Johnson's health. See Peralta, 744 F.3d at 1082 ("[E]ven if an official knows of a substantial risk, [she's] not liable 'if [she] responded reasonably.'" (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844)).
The Eighth Amendment did not require Moberg to meet with or physically examine Johnson during his sentence. When Hillstrom initially informed Moberg of Johnson's condition, Moberg was in the middle of caring for the cancer patient inmate, who she [*24]  felt had more pressing medical needs. Engle Decl. Ex. 1, at 58-59 (#57). At the time, the jail's medical department was short-staffed. Id. Ex. 1, at 30. Although the jail typically employed two nurses, Moberg was the only nurse working for the jail at the time of Johnson's sentence. Id. Moberg did not have authority to hire a second nurse. See id. Ex. 1, at 51-52. She was pregnant and on-call seven days a week. Id. Ex. 1, at 29, 46, 70. Moberg was overworked and lacked adequate resources at the jail. See id. Ex. 1, at 29, 34, 48-54. In fact, Moberg informed her supervisor that her nursing license could not continue to support the jail unless the medical staffing situation changed. Id. Ex. 1, at 53-54. On these facts, a reasonable trier of fact could not find that Moberg disregarded a substantial risk to Johnson's health by failing to visit him during his sentence. See Peralta, 744 F.3d at 1082-83 (holding that, in determining whether a prison official's conduct is reasonable, it is appropriate to consider limitations on the official's resources when the official lacks budgeting authority).6
Additionally, there is no evidence that Moberg was aware that her inaction posed a risk to Johnson's health after she finished caring for the cancer patient inmate. Based on the information she received from the deputies, Moberg believed that Johnson had everything he needed to be as safe as possible in his cell until he was released. Engle Decl. Ex. 1, at 78-79 (#57). There is nothing to suggest that Moberg knew that the deputies would ignore her instructions to provide Johnson with protective covering and secure his immediate release. See Gibson, 290 F.3d at 1188 ("If a person should have been aware of the risk, but was not, then the person has not violated the Eighth Amendment, no matter how severe the risk." (citing Jeffers v. Gomez, 267 F.3d 895, 914 (9th Cir.2001))). Consequently, Moberg is entitled to summary judgment on Johnson's Eighth Amendment claim.

3. Qualified Immunity
The Deputy Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity. Qualified immunity "shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages unless their conduct violates clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known." Clement v. Gomez, 298 F.3d 898, 903 (9th Cir. 2002). Resolving the issue of qualified immunity involves a two-step [*26]  inquiry. Id. First, the court must determine whether, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the facts show the defendants' conduct violated a constitutional right. Id. (quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001)). If the first inquiry is answered in the affirmative, the court "must further inquire 'whether the right was clearly established.'" Id. (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201). "The relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted." Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202 (citation omitted). "Officials can . . . be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances." Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741, 122 S. Ct. 2508, 153 L. Ed. 2d 666 (2002).
I have already determined that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the Deputy Defendants violated Johnson's Eighth Amendment rights. Additionally, a reasonable trier of fact could also find that those rights were "clearly established." The Ninth Circuit has held that it is clearly established that a prison official cannot intentionally deny or delay medical care. See Clement, 298 F.3d at 906 (citations omitted); Hamilton v. Endell, 981 F.2d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir. 1992) ("[T]he law regarding the medical treatment of prisoners was 'clearly established' [in 1985]." (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at 103)); see also Albers v. Whitley, 743 F.2d 1372, 1376 (9th Cir. 1984) (holding that a finding [*27]  of deliberate indifference necessarily precludes a finding of qualified immunity), rev'd on other grounds, 475 U.S. 312, 106 S. Ct. 1078, 89 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1986), Consequently, the Deputy Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.
In sum, Moberg is entitled to Summary Judgment on Johnson's First Claim for Relief. However, the Deputy Defendants are not. Defendants' argument that the County is entitled to summary judgment on Johnson's Eighth Amendment claim against it (Johnson's Second Claim for Relief) is entirely dependent on their argument that the Deputy Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Johnson's First Claim for Relief. See Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. 11-12 (#47). Consequently, the County is not entitled to summary judgment either.

II. ADA Claim
Through his Third Claim for Relief, Johnson alleges that the County and the Deputy Defendants violated Title II of the ADA by refusing to provide him with a darkened room or access to gloves. See Am. Compl. ¶ 23 (#11). For the reasons provided below, genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on Johnson's Third Claim for Relief.

A. Legal Standard
Title II of the ADA provides: "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation [*28]  in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Title II's prohibition against discrimination applies to discriminatory policies in state and local jails. See Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 209-10, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1998); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 691 (9th Cir. 2001). To prove that a jail policy violates Title II, a plaintiff must prove that "(1) [he] is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) [he] was excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated against with regard to a public entity's services, programs, or activities, and (3) such exclusion or discrimination was by reason of [his] disability," Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Weinreich v. Los Angeles County Metro. Transp. Auth., 114 F.3d 976, 978 (9th Cir. 1997)). The regulations that implement Title II require jails to "make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity." See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). It is the plaintiff's burden to show that modifications offered by the defendants were not reasonable. See Duvall v. Cty. of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Memmer v. Marin County Courts, 169 F.3d 630, 633-34 (9th Cir. 1999)).

B. Analysis
Defendants7 do not dispute that Johnson was a qualified individual with a disability [*29]  during his sentence. Rather, Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Johnson's ADA claim because they made reasonable modifications to avoid discriminating against him on the basis of his disability.8 According to Defendants, they complied with the ADA, as a matter of law, by housing Johnson in cell 903 and providing him with bedding and an extra pair of socks to cover his hands. Defendants also argue that Johnson's ADA claim fails as a matter of law because he failed to engage in an interactive process to identify reasonable accommodations to his disability. I am unpersuaded.
A reasonable trier of fact could find that housing Johnson in cell 903 was not a reasonable modification of Defendants' policy of housing inmates under florescent lighting. To be reasonable, the modification must give disabled inmates "meaningful access" to the jail. See Clark v. California, 739 F. Supp. 2d 1168, 1177 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (quoting Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301, 105 S. Ct. 712, 83 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1985)). Defendants contend that the lights in cell 903 were dimmed for the entirety of Johnson's sentence. Hillstrom Decl. ¶¶ 8-9 (#49); Lundy Decl. ¶¶ 2, 4 (#48). However, Johnson alleges that he was exposed to "full florescent light" in cell 903. Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 4 (#56). He further alleges that other cells were reduced to low light, but cell 903 never was. Id. Consequently, there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether housing Johnson in cell 903 constituted a reasonable modification.
A reasonable trier of fact could also find that providing Johnson with bedding and an extra pair of socks was not a reasonable modification. A reasonable modification must effectively accommodate the plaintiff's disability. See Dean v. Univ. at Buffalo Sch. of Med. & Biomedical Scis., 804 F.3d 178, 189 (2d Cir. 2015) ("The hallmark of a reasonable accommodation is effectiveness." (citing U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 400, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002))). Defendants [*31]  argue that the bedding was an effective modification because Johnson could have used it to cover his hands. Johnson argues that while he was able to use the bedding to cover his hands most of the time, the bedding was not sufficient to keep his hands covered when he slept. See Johnson Decl. ¶ 5 (#56). The disputed effectiveness of the bedding presents a question of material fact that cannot be resolved at summary judgment. See Lentini v. California Ctr. for the Arts, Escondido, 370 F.3d 837, 844 (9th Cir. 2004) ("[T]he determination of what constitutes reasonable modification is highly fact-specific, requiring case-by-case inquiry," (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Crowder v. Kitagawa, 81 F.3d 1480, 1486 (9th Cir. 1996))).
Additionally, as explained above, Johnson was not provided with the additional pair of socks until 6:07 a.m. on March 1, 2014. Engle Decl. Ex. 2, at 13 (#57). At that time, Johnson had already been held under florescent lighting for approximately 19 hours. See id. Ex. 2, at 5 (showing Johnson being booked at 9:50 a.m. on February 28, 2014); Johnson Deccl. ¶ 4 (#56) (Johnson admitting that he was kept in a room with no lights for the first one to two hours of his sentence). Therefore, even assuming the provision of an additional pair of socks constituted a reasonable modification, it would not relieve [*32]  Defendants of liability for the 19 hours that preceded the modification.
Finally, I also reject Defendants' argument that they are entitled to summary judgment on Johnson's ADA claim because he did not inform Defendants of his condition before he arrived at the jail. In support of that argument, Defendants cite Dark v. Curry County for the proposition that the ADA imposes an obligation on disabled individuals to initiate in an interactive process to identify reasonable accommodations. 451 F.3d 1078 (9th Cir. 2006). Defendants misstate the rule from Dark. The Dark court held that covered entities—i.e. Tillamook County—have an affirmative obligation to initiate an interactive process. Id. at 1088. Defendants attempt to flip Dark on its head by arguing that it imposes an affirmative obligation on a disabled plaintiff bringing an ADA claim. Simply put, that reading is unfounded.
In sum, genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on Johnson's Third Claim for Relief.

III. Negligence Claim
Through his Fourth Claim for Relief, Johnson alleges that the County negligently failed to ensure his health and safety during his sentence. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 27-31 (#11). The County argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on [*33]  Johnson's negligence claim because that claim is based on the same set of facts as his § 1983 claims. Johnson concedes that he is attempting to assert a negligence claim on the same set of facts as his § 1983 claims. However, Johnson contends that because his § 1983 claims are based on deliberate indifference rather than an intentional civil rights violation, he need not allege a separate set of facts to support his negligence claim. I agree.
The County relies on a line of cases from this court stating that a negligence claim cannot be based on the same set of facts as a § 1983 claim. The seminal case in that line is Shilo v. City of Portland, No. CV 04-130-AS, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38849, 2005 WL 3157563 (D. Or. Nov. 22, 2005). There, the court dismissed the plaintiff's negligence claim because it was based on the same set of facts as her § 1983 claim for use of excessive force. 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38849, [WL] at *2. Several other courts from this district have cited Shilo for the proposition that "a state common-law claim of negligence may be maintained separately from a § 1983 claim only when the negligence claim is based on facts that are different from the facts on which the § 1983 claims are based." Whitfield v. Tri-Metropolitan Transp. Dist., No. CV 06-1655, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26469, 2009 WL 839484 at *11 (D.Or. Mar. 30, 2009); accord Gregory v. City of Newberg, No. 3:15-CV-00473-BR, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126304, 2015 WL 5577755, at *8 (D. Or. Sept. 21, 2015); Woods v. Gutierrez, No. 3:11-CV-01082-BR, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176075, 2012 WL 6203170, at *12-13 (D. Or. Dec. 12, 2012); Barringer v. Clackamas Cty., [*34]  No. CV 09-068-AC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135394, 2010 WL 5349206, at *9 (D. Or. Nov. 22, 2010), report and recommendation adopted, No. CIV. 09-68-AC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135355, 2010 WL 5342965 (D. Or. Dec. 21, 2010); Hadley v. City of Beaverton, No. CV-09-022-ST, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28890, 2010 WL 1257609, at *14 (D. Or. Feb. 16, 2010), report and recommendation adopted, No. CV 09-022-ST, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28826, 2010 WL 1257610 (D. Or. Mar. 25, 2010); Rodriguez v. City of Portland, No. CIV. 09-850-KI, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98562, 2009 WL 3518004, at *2 (D. Or. Oct. 21, 2009); Saberi v. City of Portland, No. CV 04-1396-MO, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71348, 2006 WL 2707995, at *4 (D. Or. Sept. 18, 2006).
At first glance, the broad language from those cases seems to support the County's argument that Johnson's negligence claim cannot be based on the same set of facts as his § 1983 claims. However, that argument falls apart upon closer examination of Shilo and its progeny. Those cases all involved § 1983 claims for use of excessive force.9 The Shilo court relied heavily on an Eleventh Circuit case, which in turn, relied on Florida state-court decision holding that there is no cause of action for "negligent" use of excessive force. See Lewis v. City of St. Petersburg, 260 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing City of Miami v. Sanders, 672 So.2d 46, 47-48 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996)), cited with approval in, Shilo, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38849, 2005 WL 3157563, at *2. Three of this court's decisions following Shilo similarly relied on Oregon cases holding that an intentional tort cannot form the basis of a negligence action. See Woods, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176075, 2012 WL 6203170, at *12-13 (citing Kasnick v. Cooke, 116 Ore. App. 580, 842 P.2d 440, 441 (Or. App. 1992)); Barringer, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135394, 2010 WL 5349206, at *9 (citing Kasnick, 842 P.2d at 441); Saberi, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71348, 2006 WL 2707995, at *4 (citing Denton v. Arnstein, 197 Ore. 28, 250 P.2d 407, 415 (Or. 1952)).
Unlike the § 1983 claims at issue in Shilo and its progeny, Johnson's § 1983 claim is based on deliberate indifference to medical needs, which requires a showing of only subjective recklessness—not intent. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835-36 (contrasting deliberate indifference with the heightened mental state that a plaintiff must prove to succeed on an excessive force claim. (citations omitted)); Johnson, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44638, 2015 WL 1549257, at *15 (citing Snow, 681 F.3d at 985-86). Shilo and its progeny are therefore inapposite.
Indeed, Oregon law permits a plaintiff to proceed on alternative theories of negligence and recklessness. For example, Oregon Revised Statutes section 31.730(1) prohibits recovery of punitive damages unless the plaintiff [*36]  can prove, inter alia, that the defendant was reckless.10 Where there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the defendant's recklessness, the plaintiff can proceed to trial on both theories. See Schoenborn v. Stryker Corp., 801 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1103 (D. Or. 2011). Similarly, Oregon Revised Statutes section 31.715(1), (5)(c) prohibits uninsured and intoxicated drivers from recovering noneconomic damages in a suit based on a motor vehicle accident unless the driver can prove, inter alia, that the defendant was engaged in reckless driving at the time of the accident, Where there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the defendant's recklessness and the plaintiff seeks both economic and noneconomic damages, the plaintiff can proceed to trial on both theories. See Morehouse v. Haynes, 350 Ore. 318, 253 P.3d 1068, 1074-76 (Or. 2011).11 Because the Shilo line of cases is inapposite and Oregon law permits a plaintiff to proceed on alternative theories of negligence and recklessness, the County is not entitled to summary judgment on Johnson's Fourth Claim for Relief.

IV. Damages
Defendants move for partial summary judgment on Johnson's damages prayer to the extent it seeks damages for "lost wages." See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 12, 18, 24, 29 (#11). It is undisputed that Johnson was not employed at the time he was incarcerated or at any time since his release. Johnson now concedes that Defendants are entitled to partial summary judgment on his prayer for damages for lost wages. See Plf.'s Resp. 27 (#55). Consequently, Defendants should he granted summary judgment on that part of Johnson's damages prayer.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons provided above, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (#47) should be granted in part and denied in part. Moberg should be granted summary judgment on Johnson's First Claim for Relief. Additionally, Defendants should be granted partial summary judgment on Johnson's prayer for damages for lost wages. Defendants' Motion for [*38]  Summary Judgment should be denied in all other respects,
