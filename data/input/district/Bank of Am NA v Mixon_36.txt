Opinion



ORDER
The Court has before it Defendants' Rule 12(e), Rule 8(a)(2) and 8(d)(1) motion for a more definite statement and request for accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). (ECF No. 85.) Because the motion is patently frivolous and appears designed solely to delay this proceeding, it is DENIED.
Defendants have already filed multiple Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss raising numerous meritless issues. As noted in the February 11, 2022 Order, Rule 12(g)(2) provides, "[e]xcept as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under this rule must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion." (ECF No. 65 at PageID.839.) The issues Defendants raise in their current motion were, or could have been, raised in their prior motions. In any event, [*2]  a motion for a more definite statement may be filed when "a pleading . . . is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e). In light of Rule 8(a)(2)'s notice pleading standard and the opportunity for extensive pretrial discovery, motions for a more definite statement are generally disfavored. See Flagstar Bank FSB v. Gulfstream Business Bank, Inc., No. 2:13-cv-12136, 2013 WL 6017977, at *8 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 13, 2013) (citing EEOC v. FPM Grp., Ltd., 657 F. Supp. 2d 957, 966 (E.D. Tenn. 2009)). It is well established that "a motion for more definite statement 'is designed to strike at unintelligibility rather than simple want of detail. . . . [It] must be denied where the subject complaint is not so vague or ambiguous as to make it unreasonable to use pretrial devices to fill any possible gaps in detail.'" Schwable v. Coates, No. 3:05 CV 7210, 2005 WL 2002360, at *1 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 18, 2005) (alterations in original) (quoting Scarbrough v. R-Way Furniture Co., 105 F.R.D. 90, 91 (E.D. Wis. 1985)). Plaintiff's amended complaint does not meet the "so vague or ambiguous" standard. It provides more than enough clarity and detail for Defendants to prepare an answer.
As for Defendants' request for accommodations under the ADA, "federal courts do not fall within the definition of a covered 'public entity" . . . and are exempt from its provisions." Zang v. Zang, Nos. 1:11-cv-884, 1:12-cv-629, 2013 WL 4777092, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 5, 2013) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12131); see also Roman v. Jefferson at Hollywood LP, 495 F. App'x 804, 806 (9th Cir. 2012) ("While the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires state courts to make disability accommodations, the ADA does not apply to federal courts.") [*3]  (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A)). Therefore, this request is denied.
IT IS SO ORDERED
