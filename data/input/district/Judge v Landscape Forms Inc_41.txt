Opinion



OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendant Landscape Forms, Inc. seeks summary judgment (ECF No. 31 - Motion and ECF No. 32 - Brief) on all claims brought by its former employee, Plaintiff Mark Judge. Judge filed a revised response. (ECF No. 42 "Pl. Resp.") Landscape Forms filed a reply. (ECF No. 47.) Having reviewed the record and relevant legal authority, the motion will be resolved without a hearing. See W.D. Mich. LR Civ. P. 7.2(d).
Judge filed his complaint on October 12, 2012. He alleges two counts. In count 1, Judge asserts Landscape Forms violated the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and Michigan's Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act ("PWDCRA"). Judge pleads a claim for disability discrimination and a claim for refusal to accommodate. In count 2, Judge asserts Landscape Forms violated the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") by retaliating [*2]  against him for taking FMLA leave.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions, together with the affidavits, show there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Tucker v. Tennessee, 539 F.3d 526, 531 (6th Cir. 2008). The burden is on the moving party to show that no genuine issue of material fact exists, but that burden may be discharged by pointing out the absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); Bennett v. City of Eastpointe, 410 F.3d 810, 817 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). The facts, and the inferences drawn from them, must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)). Once the moving party has carried its burden, the nonmoving party must set forth specific facts in the record showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 574; Jakubowski v. Christ Hosp., Inc., 627 F.3d 195, 200 (6th Cir. 2010) ("After the moving party has met its burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party, who must present some 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248)). The question is "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to the jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-252.

BACKGROUND
 [*3] The record must be viewed in the light most favorable to Judge as the nonmoving party. For the purpose of this motion, these facts are presumed to be true.
Landscape Forms hired Judge on July 23, 2007. (ECF No. 46-4 "Judge Dep." 27 PgID 514.) In late April 2011, Judge was working at home when he injured his right arm. (Id. 52 PgID 520.) Judge informed Karen Phillips that he had been injured and was going to see the doctor. (Id. 53 PgID 520.) Phillips works for Landscape Forms as the Benefits Specialist in the Human Resources Department. (ECF No. 46-5 "Phillips Dep." 14-15 PgID 546.) After seeing a doctor, Judge had an MRI on his arm, which revealed a distal bicep rupture. (ECF No. 42-2 "Med. Records" PgID 421.)
Phillips assisted Judge with several employment-related benefits. Phillips initiated a shortterm disability benefits claim and FMLA claim on Judge's behalf, and sent the paperwork to him. (Phillips Dep. 42 PgID 553.) Judge was provisionally approved for FMLA benefits on May 4, 2011, retroactive to May 2.1 (ECF No. 42-5 PgID 432.) The approval letter informed Judge that a Health Care Certification Provider Form needed to be completed and returned by May 19. (Id.) Judge gave the certification [*4]  form to his health care providers. (Judge Dep. 54 PgID 521.)
On May 18, 2011, Dr. Thomas Ryan, M.D. performed surgery on Judge. (Med. Records PgID 420.) Dr. Ryan's office submitted the Health Care Certification Provider Form on May 23. (ECF No. 43-5 PgID 444-449.) The form states that Judge's condition began on May 18 and would last for twelve weeks. (Id. PgID 446.) The form states Judge would be incapacitated and unable to perform his job from May 18 through August 10, 2011. (Id. PgID 447.) That same day, Judge's FMLA leave was approved from May 18 through August 9. (ECF No. 43-4 PgID 442.) The letter explained that FMLA leave was available for a maximum of twelve weeks. (Id.) Judge was also approved for short-term disability benefits (ECF No. 43-1 PgID 435; ECF No. 43-2 PgID 438), and later for long-term disability benefits (ECF No. 44-3 PgID 456).2
Phillips spoke with Judge several times after the surgery (Phillips Dep. 47 PgID 554) and she took notes about each conversation (ECF No. 46-1 "Notes" PgID 476-77). Phillips first spoke with Judge on May 27. (Judge Dep. 59 PgID 522.) At that point, Judge's arm was in a cast, he had a appointment with the doctor for June 2, and he was going [*5]  to touch base after the appointment. (Id.) Phillips next spoke with Judge when she called him on June 6. (Id. 61 PgID 522.) Judge stated that the cast would remain on his arm until July 7, at which point he would contact Landscape Forms. (Id.; Notes PgID 476.) Judge left Phillips a voice mail on June 23, reiterating that the cast was supposed to be taken off on July 7, at which time he would be evaluated for returning to work. (Notes PgID 476.)
Phillips's notes reflect that she did not speak with Judge again until early August, when Judge informed Phillips that he could not use his right arm and needed six weeks of therapy. (Judge Dep. 65 PgID 523; Notes PgID 476.) Judge was supposed to be checked again around September 16. (Judge Dep. 65; Notes PgID 476.) Judge contends he gave Phillips a document from Dr. Ryan's office dated August 5, 2011. (Judge Dep. 68-69 PgID 524.) The document states Judge may return to work, but he has no use of his right arm and must use a sling. (ECF No. 44-4 PgID 458.) Phillips recalled seeing the document. (Phillips Dep. 92 PgID 566.) Judge recalled speaking with Phillips in the hallway the day he gave Phillips the note and that Phillips asked Judge to get a list [*6]  of activities he could and could not do because the note was too ambiguous. (Judge Dep. 79-80 PgID 527.)
Phillips did not speak with Judge again until September 26. (Phillips Dep. 98-99 PgID 567; Judge Dep. 81 PgID 527.) Phillips's notes shows she next left Judge a voice mail message on September 26 asking for information to update his restrictions. (Phillips Dep. 93 PgID 566; Notes PgID 477.) Judge had been seen by Dr. Ryan on September 15. (Med. Records PgID 415.) Dr. Ryan's records indicate he gave Judge a note for work allowing Judge to "increase activities as tolerated, but I do not want him doing any heavy or repetitive use of the right upper extremity[.]" (Id.) On September 23, 2011, Dr. Ryan's office issued a written note stating that Judge could not lift more than 20 pounds, was not supposed to use a manual screwdriver, and should not be doing any repetitive lifting, pulling or pushing that involved the right elbow. (ECF No. 32-3 PgID 156; Judge Dep. 82 PgID 528.) Judge faxed the note to Phillips on September 26, in response to the voice mail she left him. (Judge Dep. 76-77 PgID 526.)
The next time Phillips and Judge spoke, Phillips informed Judge that Landscape Forms could [*7]  not accommodate his existing restrictions. (Judge Dep. 83 PgID 528; Phillips Dep. 50-51 PgID 555.) Phillips explained to Judge that Landscape Forms needed to maintain appropriate staffing levels, that his position could not be left open indefinitely, and that he was being administratively terminated. (Judge Dep. 85-86 PgID 528-529.) Phillips sent Judge a letter, dated September 28, summarizing the reasons he was being administratively terminated. (ECF No. 32-2 "Termination Letter" PgID 158.) The reasons in the letter were the same as the reasons Phillips told Judge during the telephone call. (Judge Dep. 86 PgID 529) The letter also stated that Judge had been off work since May 2, 2011, and had no full-duty date of return. (Termination Letter.)
The record contains at least two factual disputes discussed by both parties. First, Judge claims, when he first reported his injury to Phillips, that he stated his recovery period would be from four to six months.3 (ECF No.42-1 "Judge Aff." ¶ 1.) Phillips denies that Judge provided any estimate of how long he would need to be off work. (Phillips Dep. 42-43 PgID 553.) Phillips stated that Judge never provided her with the four to six month recovery [*8]  estimate. (Id. 43 PgID 553.) Second, Judge claims after Phillips informed him that he was being administratively terminated, he told Phillips that he "should be released and be able to go back to work full duty with no restrictions" by November 15. (Judge Dep. 87-88 PgID 529.) Phillips denied that Judge provided her a November 15 return date. (Phillips Dep. 54-55 PgID 556.)

DISCUSSION

A. DISABILITY CLAIMS
A plaintiff alleging disability discrimination under the ADA may establish a claim using either direct evidence of discrimination or indirect evidence of discrimination. Monette v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 90 F.3d 1173, 1184-86 (6th Cir. 2996) abrogated on other grounds by Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp., 681 F.3d 312 (6th Cir. 2012). When a plaintiff relies on indirect evidence of discrimination, the plaintiff must establish (1) he or she is disabled, (2) is otherwise qualified for the job with or without a reasonable accommodation, (3) suffered an adverse employment decision, (4) the employer knew or had reason to know of the disability, and (5) after the adverse employment decision, the position remained open or the disabled individual was replaced. Id. at 1185. When a plaintiff presents a claim using indirect evidence of disability discrimination, the familiar burden-shifting scheme outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) applies. Id. 1184-85. If plaintiff establishes [*9]  a prima facie case, the employer may then offer a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, unrelated to the plaintiff's disability. Id. at 1185-86. The plaintiff must then demonstrate why the proffered explanation is pretext for unlawful discrimination. Id. at 1186.
When a plaintiff has direct evidence of disability discrimination, the elements of the claim are largely the same, but the burden of proof changes. A plaintiff has direct evidence of disability discrimination when the employer relies on the plaintiff's disability in making an adverse employment decision. Monette, 90 F.3d at 1186. In the case when the decision is made on the basis of the plaintiff's disability, the plaintiff must establish (1) he or she is disabled, and (2) is otherwise qualified for the position, (a) without accommodation, (b), with alleged "essential" job requirements eliminated, or (c) with a proposed reasonable accommodation. Id. The employer, however, must prove that the challenged job criterion is essential or that the proposed accommodation would impose an undue hardship. Id.
Judge asserts two disability claims, identifying two adverse employment decisions. First, Judge asserts a claim based on the decision to administratively terminate [*10]  him. Second, Judge asserts a claim for failure to accommodate.

1. Disability
Landscape Forms contends temporary conditions that are expected to fully heal do not constitute a disability for the purposes of the ADA. Judge insists his torn bicep qualifies as a disability. The ADA defines "disability" as (a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual, (b) a record of such an impairment, or (c) being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1) (West, Westlaw through P.L. 113-74 (excluding 113-66 and 113-73) approved Jan. 16, 2014). The statute provides that "[t]he definition of disability . . . shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under this chapter, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter." Id. § 12102(4)(A).
Because the adverse employment decisions were made after January 1, 2009, when the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") became effective, the ADAAA applies. See Milholland v. Sumner Cnty. Bd. of Ed., 569 F.3d 562, 565 (6th Cir. 2009). The 2008 amendments were enacted, at least in part, because Congress concluded that courts were interpreting the ADA too narrowly and were denying protection to individuals Congress intended to protect. See ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. Law 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 Sec. (2)(a)(5). In Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 198, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002), the United State Supreme Court held [*11]  that "to be substantially limited in performing manual tasks, an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives. The impairment's impact must also be permanent or long term." The 2008 Amendments rejected the Toyota court's interpretation that to be substantially limited, the impairment must prevent or severely restrict the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives. ADA Amendments Act of 2008 Sec. 2(b)(4)-(5). Regulations enacted as part of the implementation of the ADAAA provide that the "effects of an impairment lasting or expecting to last fewer than six months can be substantially limiting within the meaning of this section."4 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ix) (West, Westlaw current through Feb. 21, 2014).
Courts have not uniformly applied the definition of "disability" to temporary impairments, like Judge's torn bicep. Numerous courts interpreting the ADA before the 2008 amendments held that temporary physical impairments that prevented an employee from working for a limited period of time, like a broken bone, did not qualify as a disability. See Pollard v. High's of Baltimore, 281 F.3d 462, 468 (4th Cir. 2002); McDonald v. Pennsylvania, 62 F.3d 92, 96 (3d Cir. 1995); Vande Zande v. Wisconsin Dep't of Admin., 44 F.3d 538, 544 (7th Cir. 1995); Evans v. City of Dallas, 861 F.2d 846, 852-53 (5th Cir. 1988). In cases involving claims brought under [*12]  the ADAAA, several federal district courts have continued to find that "temporary, short-term or non-severe conditions do not satisfy the definition of disability under the 'actual' prong." McKenzie-Nevolas v. Deaconess Holdings, LLC,    F. Supp. 2d   , 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15545, 2014 WL 518086, at * 2 (W.D. Ok. Feb. 7, 2014) (slip. op.) (involving inflamation of breast tissue that lasts 2 to 3 weeks and collecting cases); see Bush v. Donahoe, 964 F. Supp. 2d 401, 2013 WL 4045785, at *12-*15 (W.D. Pa. 2013) (involving a foot or ankle sprain that was treated with a protective boot and did not include any work restrictions and collecting and discussing cases). In at least one case, the court concluded that "even under the ADAAA's broadened definition of disability short term impairments would still not render a person disabled within the meaning of the statute." Wanamaker v. Westport Bd. of Ed., 899 F.Supp.2d 193, 211 (D. Conn. 2012).
In contrast, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the ADAAA "abrogated" the earlier holdings that a temporary impairment cannot constitute a disability. Summers v. Altarum Inst., Corp., 740 F.3d 325, 331 (4th Cir. 2014) (involving fractures and tendon tears or ruptures to parts of both legs and the inability to walk normally for more than seven months). This Court is aware of only one Sixth Circuit case finding that a temporary impairment, an injured shoulder, met the definition of disability. See Gantt v. Wilson Sporting Goods, 143 F.3d 1042, 1047 (6th Cir. 1998). The holding, however, is dicta as the court was offering an alternative basis for rejecting the ADA claim. The [*13]  circuit court held that Gantt never requested a reasonable accommodation and, alternatively, could not establish that she was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job.
In reaching its decision in Summers, the Fourth Circuit relied on the regulations implementing the ADAAA and the appendix to the regulations, titled "Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act." The Appendix to section 1630.2(j)(1)(ix) addresses impairments lasting less than six months.
The regulations include a clear statement that the definition of an impairment as transitory, that is, "lasting or expected to last for six months or less," applies only to the "regarded as" (third) prong of the definition of "disability" as part of the "transitory and minor" defense to "regarded as" coverage. It does not apply to the first or second prong of the definition of disability. . . .
Therefore, an impairment does not have to last for more than six months in order to be considered substantially limiting under the first or second prong of the definition of disability. For example, as noted above, if an individual has a back impairment that results in a 20-pound lifting restriction that lasts for several months, [*14]  he is substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting, and therefore covered under the first prong of the definition of disability. At the same time, "[t]he duration of the impairment is one factor that is relevant in determining whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Impairments that last only for a short period of time are typically not covered, although they may be covered if sufficiently severe." Joint Hoyer-Sensenbrenner Statement at 5.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ix) app. (West, Westlaw current through Feb. 21, 2014).
The Court finds persuasive the guidance provided in the Appendix and the specific example used to illustrate when a temporary impairment might constitute a disability. Whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity should be an individualized assessment. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(iv). Judge has offered evidence that his doctor determined him incapacitated from May 18, 2011, through August 10, 2011. (ECF No. 43-4 PgID 442.) On August 5, Judge's doctor concluded he was "ok to return to work," but should not use his right arm. (ECF No. 44-4 PgID 458.) By September 15, the doctor issued new restrictions, limiting Judge to lifting no more than 20 pounds, no use of a manual screwdriver, [*15]  and no repetitive motions involving the bending of his right elbow. (ECF No. 32-3 PgID 156.) This temporary restriction, the very restriction identified in the Appendix, was in place when Judge was terminated. On these facts, there exists at least a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether Judge was disabled at the time of his termination for the purpose of his federal disability claim.
Landscape Form is, however, entitled to summary judgment on Judge's disability claim brought under Michigan law. For Judge's claim under Michigan's PWDCRA, this Court must apply Michigan law. See United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1996) ("It has consistently been recognized that pendant jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiff's right. Its justification lies in considerations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants; if these are not present a federal court should hesitate to exercise jurisdiction over the state claims, even though bound to apply state law to them[.]"). Under Michigan law, for an impairment to qualify as a disability, it must substantially limit one or more major life activities and must be unrelated to the individual's ability to perform the duties of the plaintiff's job. [*16]  Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.1103(d)(I) (West, Westlaw current through 2014 Pub. Act No. 11, of the 2014 Regular Session, 97th Legislature). In determining whether an impairment is substantially limiting, Michigan courts consider (a) the nature and severity of the impairment, (b) the duration or expected duration of the impairment, and (3) the permanent or expected permanent or long-term effect. Chiles v. Mach. Shop, Inc., 238 Mich. App. 462, 606 N.W.2d 398, 408 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999). Michigan courts have held that temporary medical conditions, even those requiring extended leaves from work, "the standard example being a broken leg," do not qualify as a disability under the PWDCRA. Id. (quoting Lown v. JJ Eaton Place, 235 Mich. App. 721, 598 N.W.2d 633, (Mich. Ct. App. 1999)). Unlike its federal counterpart, the PWDCRA has not been amended to address the narrow manner in which courts have interpreted the statute. Furthermore, although Landscape Forms raised the distinction between the state and federal statute as part of its motion, Judge did not address the difference in his response.

2. Failure to Accommodate
Without question, at the time he was terminated, Judge could not perform the essential requirements of his job with Landscape Forms. Landscape Forms argues Judge never requested a reasonable accommodation. Judge asserts Landscape Forms should have provided him a leave of absence until [*17]  November 15, 2011. Judge contends summary judgment should be denied because a genuine issue of material fact exists about what Judge told Phillips about his expected date of return.
For failure to accommodate claims, the plaintiff must ordinarily establish that he or she requested an accommodation. Brown v. Chase Brass & Copper Co., Inc., 14 F.App'x 482, 487 (6th Cir. 2001) ("Since he failed to propose an accommodation of his disability, he cannot satisfy the second element of his prima facie case (being qualified to perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation), so his ADA claim fails."); Gantt, 143 F.3d at 1047 ("Because Plaintiff made no request for accommodation the district court properly found that she failed to create an issue of fact as to whether or not the Company failed to reasonably accommodate her."); see Lockard v. Gen. Motors Corp., 52 F.App'x 782, 788 (6th Cir. 2002) ("Because we find [the employee] failed to request a reasonable accommodation from her employer, the [employer's] duty to engage in an interactive search for a reasonable accommodation never arose."). The Sixth Circuit has rejected a per se rule that temporary leave is an unreasonable accommodation, reasoning that the employer always bears the burden of proving the requested accommodation is unreasonable. Cehrs v. Northeast Ohio Alzheimer's Research Ctr., 155 F.3d 775, 782 (6th Cir. 1998). The Sixth Circuit has also held [*18]  that a "[r]easonable accommodation does not require the employer to wait indefinitely for an employee's medical condition to be corrected." Gantt, 143 F.3d at 1047. Neither are employers "required to keep an employee on staff indefinitely in the hope that some position may become available some time in the future." Monette, 90 F.3d at 1187.
Landscape Forms has established a lack of a genuine issue of material dispute on the question of whether Judge requested a reasonable accommodation. Judge's affidavit, which was created after the motion for summary judgment was filed, contains the only evidence in the record supporting Judge's claim that he informed Phillips that his recovery time would be from four to six months. (Judge Aff. ¶ 1.) On the FMLA certification form, however, Dr. Ryan wrote that Judge would be incapacitated for twelve weeks, through August 10. (ECF No. 43-5 PgID 446-47.) In early August, Judge informed Phillips that his cast had come off and he needed six weeks of therapy (Judge Dep. 65 PgID 523) and also provided Phillips a note from Dr. Ryan releasing Judge to return to work with restrictions (Phillips Dep. 92 PgID 566; ECF No. 44-4 PgID 458). Judge, however, did not return to work. More than six weeks passed and Phillips [*19]  had not heard from Judge, so Phillips initiated contact and left a message on Judge's voice mail on September 26, 2011, asking for an update. (Phillips Dep. 93, 98-99.) Only then did Judge fax Phillips a note identifying new restrictions. (ECF No. 32-3 PgID 156.) The note did not indicate: 1) Judge was still in therapy, or 2) could not return to work, or 3) when the new restrictions would be lifted. Unlike previous communication with Phillips, Judge did not inform her of any future appointments with Dr. Ryan.
Based on the information contained in the faxed note, the decision was made that Landscape Forms could not accommodate the new restrictions and Judge would be administratively terminated. After receiving the note, Phillips discussed the situation, including Landscape Forms's needs, with Kal Kalkowski, Judge's supervisor, and Becky Fulgoni. (Phillips Dep. 46-47 PgID 554.) Kalkowski responded that the new restrictions could not be accommodated. (Id. 50 PgID 555.) Phillips testified that, as a manufacturing facility, Landscape Forms did not have any one-handed work available. (Id. 48 PgID 555.) Phillips then telephoned Judge and conveyed the decision that his restrictions could not be accommodated [*20]  and that he was being administratively terminated. (Id.)
Judge's alleged statement to Phillips at the outset of the injury, that his recovery would take four to six months, does not create a genuine issue of material fact that Landscape Forms failed to reasonably accommodate Judge. Announcing one's prospective recovery period from surgery is not the functional equivalent of requesting an accommodation for a disability. See Lockard, 52 F.App'x at 788 (citing Schmidt v. Safeway, Inc., 864 F.Supp. 991, 997 (D. Or. 1994) (noting that an employee cannot "expect the employer to read his mind and know he secretly wanted a particular accommodation")). Similarly, informing your employer that you need six weeks of therapy is not a substitute for requesting an accommodation. Judge has not identified any portion of the record supporting the conclusion, or even allowing for the inference, that he ever asked Landscape Forms for a leave of absence. Rather, Judge submitted requests for FMLA leave and for disability pay, which were processed by third parties. The documentation from Dr. Ryan indicated Judge would be incapacitated only through August 10. Dr. Ryan later released Judge to return to work with restrictions on August 5. Because Judge never initiated the discussion of a reasonable [*21]  accommodation, Landscape Forms did not fail to provide a reasonable accommodation. See Brown, 14 F.App'x at 487 (holding that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the employee's various requests should have been treated as a request for an ADA accommodation).
Judge's alleged statement to Phillips that he should be able to return to work without restrictions by November 15 also fails to create a genuine issue of material fact. When the decision to terminate Judge was made, Judge had not provided Landscape Forms with any definite date for returning to work without restrictions. Judge admits he did not communicate his potential return to work to Phillips until after Phillips had informed Judge of the decision to terminate him. (Judge Dep. 87-88 PgID 529.) Judge concedes that, at the time of the conversation with Phillips, his return to work without restrictions was speculation on his part. (Judge Dep. 90-91 PgID 530.) Although Judge was ultimately released from the work restrictions on November 15, he did not provide that information to anyone at Landscape Forms. (Judge Dep. 91-92 PgID 530.)
These same facts entitle Landscape Forms to summary judgment on the claim arising from the decision to terminate [*22]  Judge. If the claim relies on direct evidence, the analysis would be the same. If the termination claim relies on indirect evidence, Landscape Forms has established a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision, which Judge has not shown to be pretext.
Landscape Forms is also entitled to summary judgment under Michigan law. Although federal law does not exclude time off as a reasonable accommodation, Michigan law is more restrictive. In Michigan, courts have rejected the reasonable time to heal doctrine and held that an employer's duty to make a reasonable accommodation to an injured employee under the state statute "does not extend to granting the plaintiff a medical leave until such time as he would be able to perform the requirements of his job." Kerns v. Dura Mech. Components, Inc., 242 Mich. App. 1, 618 N.W.2d 56, 64 (Mich. Ct. App. 2000) (citations omitted); see Lamoria v. Health Care & Retirement Corp., 233 Mich. App. 560, 593 N.W.2d 699, 701 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999) (per curiam) (convening a special panel to resolve a conflict between published opinions regarding the reasonable time to heal doctrine).5

B. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT CLAIMS
A plaintiff can establish a discrimination claim under the FMLA by showing that her employer retaliated against her for using FMLA leave. Bryant v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 538 F.3d 394, 401 (6th Cir. 2008). To prevail on a claim for discrimination under the FMLA, a plaintiff must show [*23]  (1) she engaged in a statutorily protected activity, i.e., took FMLA leave, (2) suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Daugherty v. Sajar Plastics, Inc., 544 F.3d 696, 707 (6th Cir. 2008). Like claims under the ADA, a plaintiff may rely on either direct or circumstantial evidence for a claim under the FMLA. See Bryson v. Regis Corp., 498 F.3d 561, 570 (6th Cir. 2007). When a plaintiff relies upon indirect evidence of retaliation, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting scheme applies. Id.

1. Timeliness
Landscape Forms argues Judge's FMLA claim was not timely filed. When Judge began working for Landscape Forms, the application for employment he signed included a clause that any lawsuit against Landscape Forms arising out of his employment, including claims under state and federal civil rights statutes, must be brought within certain time limits. Judge does not challenge the language of the application, or that he signed the application, or that he brought the claim after the contractual time limit expired.6 Instead, Judge argues the agreement to shorten the time to file any claim cannot apply to claims brought under the FMLA.
After a violation of the FMLA, an employee has two years to bring his or her claim, or three [*24]  years if the employer willfully violated the statute. 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1)-(2). The United States Supreme Court has noted the law is "well-established that, in the absence of a controlling statute to the contrary," parties may contractually limit the time for bringing a claim to a period less than the time provided by a general statute of limitations." Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v. Wolfe, 331 U.S. 586, 608, 67 S. Ct. 1355, 91 L. Ed. 1687 (1947). Following this lead, some employers have attempted to contractually limit the time an employee has to bring a claim under the FMLA, with mixed results. In FMLA lawsuits, federal district courts have reached inconsistent outcomes as to whether a contractual agreement limiting the time to bring a claim against the employer is enforceable. Compare Plitsas v. Fed. Express, Inc., No. 07-5439, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39586, 2010 WL 1644056, at * 6 (D.N.J. Apr. 22, 2010) (holding the contractual limitation does not apply to FMLA claims) and Grosso v. Fed. Express Corp., 467 F.Supp.2d 449, 457 (E.D. Pa. 2006) (same) with Badgett v. Fed. Express Corp., 378 F.Supp.2d 613, 623-26 (M.D.N.C. 2005) (holding that the contractual limitation could be enforced against the FMLA claim). The Sixth Circuit has reviewed the differing results, but has not resolved the conflicting outcomes. See Bates v. 84 Lumber Co., 205 F.App'x 317, 324 (6th Cir. 2006) ("As noted, our court has not yet decided whether FMLA claims can be contractually limited. . . . Making circuit precedent on an issue of first impression, however, is not necessary to the resolution of this case . . . ."). Federal district courts [*25]  in the Eastern and Western Districts of Michigan, however, have concluded that parties cannot contractually limit the time to file FMLA claims. See Conway v. Stryker Med. Div., No. 4:05-cv-40, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20753, 2006 WL 1008670, at * 1 (W.D. Mich. Apr. 18, 2006) (Enslen, S.D.J.) (holding the contractual limitation "unenforceable under the terms of the FMLA and as a matter of public policy."); Lewis v. Harper Hosp., 241 F.Supp.2d 769, 772-73 (E.D. Mich. 2002) (Duggan, D.J.) ("The Court is satisfied that imposing a six month statute of limitation is an interference with employee's rights under the FMLA where the statute of limitations is either two or three years."); see also Madry v. Gibraltor Nat'l Corp., No. 10-13886, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44079, 2011 WL 1565807, at *2-*4 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 25, 2011) (Whalen, M..J.) (collecting cases voiding a contractual limitation on FMLA claims, discussing Badgett, and concluding that the Lewis line of cases "represent the better reasoned authorities.")
Although the plain reading of the statute itself contains no prohibition on the ability of parties to contractually agree to a shorter period, the Department of Labor on February 6, 2013, promulgated regulations addressing the situation.
(a) The FMLA prohibits interference with an employee's rights under the law, and with legal proceedings or inquiries relating to an employee's rights. More specifically, the law contains the following employee protections: [*26] 
(1) An employer is prohibited from interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise of (or attempts to exercise) any rights provided by the Act.
***
(b) Any violations of the Act or of these regulations constitute interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise of rights provided by the Act. . . .
***
(d) Employees cannot waive, nor may employers induce employees to waive, their prospective rights under FMLA. For example, employees (or their collective bargaining representatives) cannot trade off the rights to take FMLA leave against some other benefit offered by the employer. This does not prevent the settlement or release of FMLA claims by employees based on past employer conduct without the approval of the Department of Labor or a court. Nor does it prevent an employee's voluntary and uncoerced acceptance (not as a condition of employment) of a light duty assignment while recovering from a serious health condition. See § 825.702(d). An employee's acceptance of such light duty assignment does not constitute a waiver of the employee's prospective rights, including the right to be restored to the same position the employee held at the time the employee's FMLA leave commenced or to an equivalent [*27]  position. The employee's right of restoration, however, ceases at the end of the applicable 12-month FMLA leave year.
29 C.F.R. § 825.220 (West, Westlaw current through Feb. 27, 2014).
FMLA-related regulations properly issued by the Department of Labor pursuant to statutory delegation, like this one, are entitled to deference under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). See Bryant, 538 F.3d at 399. Accord Whiting v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., 416 F.App'x 312, 315-16 (4th Cir. 2011). An agency's interpretation of a statute, reflected in a regulation adopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking, is reviewed under the framework outlined in Metro. Hosp. v. United States HHS, 712 F.3d 248, 254 (6th Cir. 2013). First, the reviewing court must determine whether Congress has addressed the specific issue presented in the litigation. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842. If a plain reading of the statute resolves the matter, the court must give effect to Congress's unambiguously expressed intent. Id. Only when the statute is silent or ambiguous does the court proceed to the second step. Id. at 843. The reviewing court must determine whether the regulation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. Id. "The court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction, or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding." [*28]  Id. at 843 n.11. Here, both steps must be resolved in favor of the regulation. The FMLA is silent about whether the employer and employee may contractually limit the period for bringing a claim. The Department of Labor's interpretation is one possible construction of the statute. Under Chevron, this Court must give effect to the regulation, even if this Court would have resolved the matter differently.
Therefore, Landscape Forms is not entitled to summary judgment on the basis that Judge failed to timely file his claim. The regulations prohibit employers from inducing employees to waive prospective rights under the FMLA by, among other things, making the waiver a condition of employment.

2. Retaliation
Landscape Forms argues the record contains no evidence of retaliation. Landscape Forms does not deny that Judge used FMLA leave. Landscape Forms does not deny that Judge suffered an adverse employment decision. The Court interprets the argument, therefore, as challenging Judge's ability to show a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action or, alternatively, pretext.
For the purpose of this motion, the Court accepts that two months or less passed between the date on [*29]  which Judge's FMLA leave expired and the date on which he was terminated, allowing the inference of a causal connection between the two events. The Sixth Circuit "has embraced the premise that in certain distinct cases where the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action is acutely near in time, that close proximity is deemed indirect evidence such as to permit an inference of retaliation to arise." Seeger v. Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co., LLC, 681 F.3d 274, 283 (6th Cir. 2012) (involving a claim for retaliation under the FMLA) (quoting DiCarlo v. Potter, 358 F.3d 408, 421 (6th Cir. 2004)). The Sixth Circuit, however, has not established any bright-line rule for temporal proximity giving rise to such an inference. See Chaney v. Eberspaecher North America, 955 F.Supp.2d 811, 818-19 (E.D. Mich. 2013).
Landscape Forms is entitled to summary judge because it offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Judge and Judge has not established that the reason was pretext. When the employer knows a person cannot return to work after he or she has used all of the 12-week FMLA leave, that knowledge serves as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating the employee when the employee alleges FMLA retaliation. Edgar v. JAC Prods., Inc., 443 F.3d 501, 513-14 (6th Cir. 2006). Judge was administratively terminated because Landscape Forms needed to maintain staffing levels and Judge had not provided a date [*30]  on which he would return to work without restrictions. (Judge Dep. 85-86 PgID 528-29; Termination Letter.) Judge argues the reason given by Landscape Forms is false; he did give a date for his return to work. The record does not support Judge's assertion. As explained above, the Court assumes for this motion that Judge did relate to Phillips his prospective four to six month recovery period. Dr. Ryan allowed Judge to return to work with restrictions in early August. Judge, however, did not make arrangements to return to work or to take a leave of absence. When Landscape Forms made the decision to terminate Judge, it did not know when Judge intended to return to work, with or without restrictions.

CONCLUSION
Landscape Forms is entitled to summary judgment on the ADA, FMLA, and state law claims brought against it by its former employee, Mark Judge. Landscape Forms has established that Judge did not ask for a reasonable accommodation and that its decision to terminate Judge was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.
