ORDER REGARDING CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGEMENT
[Doc. Nos. 47, 50]
This matter comes before the Court on Defendants City of San Diego ("City") and Air California Adventure, Inc. d/b/a Torrey Pines Gliderport ("ACA") (collectively "Defendants") Motion for Summary Judgment or in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 47] and Plaintiffs' Cross Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 50.] The motions have been fully briefed and the Court finds it suitable for determination on the papers submitted and without oral arguments [*2]  in accordance with Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1).

I. Background
Plaintiffs are both unable to walk or stand independently as the result of paraplegia, and use wheelchairs for mobility. [Doc. No. 1 at ¶ 4.] On March 11, 2013 and March 13, 2013, Plaintiffs visited the Torrey Pines Gliderport ("Gliderport") seeking to join other spectators in watching the sailplanes, hang gliders and paragliders and allegedly encountered various barriers that denied them "full and equal access to and enjoyment" of the premises. [Id. at ¶¶ 15-20.]
The Gliderport is owned by the City and leased to ACA. [Id. at ¶¶ 5-6.] The City is a public entity as contemplated by the ADA. [Id. at ¶ 5.]
On December 12, 2013 Plaintiffs Scott Schutza and John Karczweksi (collectively "Plaintiffs") filed suit against Defendants alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C Sections 12101, et seq., the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil Code Section 51, et seq., and the California Disabled Persons Act ("CPDA"), California Civil Code Sections 54.1 et seq.
The essence of the present dispute concerns the validity, potential mootness and achievability of Plaintiffs' ADA claims. Plaintiffs contend that the alleged barriers listed in their motion are violations of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities [*3]  ("ADAAG"), the California Building Code ("CBC") or both; that those violations prevent their full and equal access to the Gliderport; and that they are deterred from returning to the Gliderport until all alleged barriers have been removed.
Defendants counter that the Gliderport is not a public accommodation and as a property listed under the National Historic Preservation Act it is therefore not subject to the ADA. Defendants also contend that even if the Gliderport is subject to the ADA the violation has either been remedied or the cost of removing the alleged barriers is prohibitively high, rendering the claims moot. Further, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs had equal access to the Gliderport's facilities because of modified policies, practices, procedures, and alternative methods of access that were in place prior to the filing of this lawsuit. Defendants also assert that Plaintiffs failed to join indispensable parties, California Coastal Commission and the Federal Department of the Interior (or National Parks Service). Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lacks standing to bring their state law claims because they were never denied access to the Gliderport.

II. Legal Standard [*4] 
Under Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is proper when the "pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any , show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Entry of summary judgment is proper "against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The moving party has the initial burden of "identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, "which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.
If a moving party carries its burden of production, the nonmoving party must produce evidence to support its claim or defense. See Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Cos, Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir. 2000); High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus. Sec. Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, 574 (9th Cir. 1990); Cline v. Indus. Maint. Eng'g. & Contracting Co., 200 F.3d 1223, 1229 (9th Cir. 1991). Rule 56(e) requires "the nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, of by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. The nonmoving party cannot [*5]  "rest upon mere allegations or denials of his pleadings." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The mere existence of some factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247 - 248. "Summary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is 'genuine,' that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. The inquiry is whether "the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Id. at 251 - 252. The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, at 158-159, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970).
"When parties submit cross-motions for summary judgment, '[e]ach motion must be considered on its own merits." Fair Housing Council of Riverside Cnty., Inc. v. Riverside Two, 249 F.3d 1132, 1136 (9th Cir. 2001) (quotations and citations omitted). The court must review the evidence submitted in support of each cross-motion and determine whether disputed issues of material fact are present, even if both parties assert that there are no uncontested issues of material fact. Id; see also United States v. Fred A. Arnold, Inc., 573 F.2d 605, 606 (9th Cir. 2000). If, however, the cross-motions are before [*6]  the court at the same time, the court is obliged to consider the evidence proffered by both sets of motions before ruling on either one. Fair Housing Council of Riverside Cnty., Inc., 249 F.3d at 1134.

III. Discussion
Since the cross motions for summary judgment request adjudication of the same issues and contain arguments common to both, the Court will address the motions together.

A. Violation of Title II of the ADA
Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination by public entities and the statutory language states in relevant part: "[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. While the ADA does not define the "services, programs, or activities of a public entity," the Ninth Circuit has cautioned against engaging in "needless 'hair splitting arguments'" and held that the ADA's use of the phrase "bring[s] within its scope anything a public entity does." Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002) (brackets and quotations omitted).
To prove that a public program or service violates Title II, a plaintiff must show: (1) he/she is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) he/she is otherwise [*7]  qualified to participate in or receive the benefit of some public entity's services, programs, or activities; (3) he/she was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public entity's services, programs or activities, or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity; and (4) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of his/her disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Weinrich v. Los Angeles Cnty. Metro. Transp. Auth., 114 F.3d 976, 978 (9th Cir. 1997); Cohen v. City of Culver City, 754 F.3d 690, 695 (9th Cir. 2014).
An individual is excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public program if "a public entity's facilities are inaccessible by individuals with disabilities." 28 C.F.R. § 35.149. The access public entities have to provide depends on when the facility was constructed, structural changes are not required to be made to existing facilities constructed before January 26, 1992 where other methods are effective in achieving compliance. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12183(a)(1) and 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv); see Cohen, 754 F.3d at 695.
The regulations allow public entities to use a variety of methods to make existing facilities 'readily accessible,' including the less costly measures of relocating services to alternative, accessible sites/buildings or assigning aides to assist persons with disabilities in accessing services. Id. at § 35.150(b)(1). Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 532, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 158 L. Ed. 2d 820 (a variety of less costly measures may be adopted [*8]  by public entities where structural change to older facilities are likely to be more difficult); Daubert v. Lindsay Sch. Dist., 760 F.3d 982, 988 (9th Cir. 2014) (existing facilities not required to undergo structural changes to achieve integration); Parker v. Universidad de Puerto Rico, 225 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000) (public entities given flexibility to choose how best to ensure broad access to public services is made available). In other words, a public entity must "operate each . . . program . . . [so that it] is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities." Daubert, 760 F.3d at 987 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)) (emphasis in original).
When choosing among available 'readily accessible' methods a public entity "shall give priority to those methods that offer services, programs, and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate." 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1). "[I]n no event is the entity required to undertake measures that would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, threaten historic preservation interests, or effect a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service." Lane, 541 U.S. at 532. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)(2).
If the facility predates 1992, a Title II plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the elements of the prima facia case, including, if needed, "'the existence of a reasonable accommodation that would enable [plaintiff] [*9]  to participate in the program, service or activity at issue. The public entity may then rebut this by showing that the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration or would produce an undue burden.'" Pierce v. Cnty. Of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190, 1217 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)(3)). "The question whether a particular accommodation is reasonable 'depends on the individual circumstances of each case' and 'requires a fact-specific, individualized analysis of the disabled individual's circumstances and the accommodations that might allow him to meet the program's standards.'" Vinson v. Thomas, 288 F.3d 1145, 1154 (9th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted); see also Pierce, 526 at 1217 (9th Cir. 2008) ("determining whether a modification or accommodation is reasonable always requires a fact-specific, context-specific inquiry."). Inquiry into the reasonableness of accommodation is generally resolved at trial rather than on summary judgment, as reasonableness determination implicates both law and fact. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, § 2 et seq., 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101 et seq.
Defendants contend that the services and activities at the Gliderport were offered by a private entity, ACA, making Title II inapplicable, but they provide scant evidence in support of their position. [Doc. No. 47-1 at 14-151 ; Doc. No. 63 at 9.] Defendants simply [*10]  state that Schutza "believes he ordered, received, and ate lunch at the property. Karczewski admits he went paragliding with ACA staff. That is both plaintiffs took advantage of the only services, programs, or activities available at the location." [Doc. No. 47-1 at 15.] Plaintiffs counter that it makes no difference if it's the City or ACA running the activity because "'a public entity, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements' discriminate against individuals with disabilities." [Doc No. 60-1 at 9-10 quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1).]
The Court does not find Defendants argument to be persuasive. Plaintiffs have followed the advice given by the Ninth Circuit that "in a case in which the property owner is a public entity and the operator of the public accommodation is a private entity, it will be in the plaintiff's best interest to sue both the landlord, under Title II, and the operator of the public accommodation, under Title III, thereby affording the court the greatest flexibility in fashioning appropriate relief." Disabled Rights Action Comm. v. Las Vegas Events, Inc., 375 F.3d 861, 884 (9th Cir. 2004) (emphasis in original). Defendants have entered into contractual agreements that allow for the use of the City owned [*11]  land located at the Gliderport. [Doc. No. 50-11.] The fact that ACA controls and manages the Gliderport does not excuse the City of its obligation to ensure that it is operated in a manner that enables the City to meet its Title II obligations. See American with Disabilities Act, Title II Technical Assistance Manual, § II-1.3000 (1993); see also Disabled Rights Action Comm., 375 F.3d at 872-76 (holding that private entity that operated a public accommodation on public property pursuant to a contract with a public entity could be liable under Title III of the ADA).
Defendants' second argument is premised on the proposition that the historic nature of the Gliderport excused it from having to be retrofitted or upgraded by the City to make it usable or accessible to individuals with disabilities and that "in the joust of interests between historical preservation and alterations for disabled access, historical preservation should carry the day." [Doc. No. 47-1 at 14-15; Doc. No. 55 at 27-28; Doc. No. 63 at 9.] Plaintiffs' position is that the requested modifications would not affect the Gliderport's historic designation because the designation is based on events in history and not on the structures contained on the site. [Doc. No. 47-6 [*12]  at 5; Doc. No. 60-1 at 12-13.] Defendants make the conclusory assertion without providing any legal authority in support of it. Defendants suggest that they have two choices, between doing essentially nothing or destroying the historic nature of the Gliderport. But the Court does not find this argument persuasive as it goes against the very purpose of the ADA, which is a statute aimed at increasing accessibility.
The Gliderport is not excused from being ADA complaint simply by virtue of the fact that it is historic. An examination into whether a reasonable accommodation exists and if the accommodation would require a fundamental alteration or produce an undue burden is required. Here, both parties have submitted evidence in support of their positions that demonstrate that material questions of fact remain with respect to whether the accommodations requested by Plaintiffs would require the Gliderport to be fundamental altered or be financially burdensome. See discussion infra Part III.B.3.
Thirdly, Defendants contend that the ADA is not applicable to the Gliderport because in reality it's "a beach on an ocean bluff" that cannot be retooled to be ADA accessible without doing significant [*13]  violence to its natural state. [Doc. No. 47-1 at 18.] In support of this position Defendants point to an absence of regulations governing such outdoor spaces. [Doc. No. 55 at 18-19.] But the absence of an exactly on point regulation should not excuse non-compliance. See for example Fortyune v. City of Lomita, 766 F.3d 1098, 1106 (9th Cir. 2014) (in the absence of a specific regulation public entities must still provide reasonable access to public facilities under the ADA). The absence of an on-point regulation is not preventing the City from "planning to make all areas where-possible ADA accessible." [Doc. No. 47-7; Doc No. 47-8; Doc. No. 55-3 at 28, 49, 53, 55-56.] With this in mind, the Court finds Defendants all or nothing approach unwarranted. Plaintiffs are challenging the restrooms, parking, tables and a transaction counter at the Gliderport, all of which are covered by accessible standards.
Fourthly, in a footnote in their Reply to Plaintiffs' Opposition, Defendants also contend that if Plaintiffs were making a claim against the City that they intended to return to the Gliderport in the future to watch the sailplanes, hang gliders and paragliders the City has complied with 28 C.F.R. § 35.150 because the activity of "watching flights taking place in the air [*14]  above can be accomplished nearly anywhere, including from the street leading to the location [Doc. No. 63 at 5, fn. 4 (citing Doc. No. 55-4 at ¶ 3).] However, simply providing an alternative site — the public street - for watching sailplanes, hang gliders and paragliders does not establish if the other services, programs and activities offered at the Gliderport are "readily accessible" to individuals who use wheelchairs.
It is clear that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the relief sought by Plaintiffs are reasonable accommodations. As a result both Defendants' and Plaintiffs' request for judgment on Plaintiffs' Title II claim for relief are DENIED.

B. Violation of Title III of the ADA.
Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against disabled individuals in any place of public accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12182. The ADA "guarantees the disabled more than mere access to public facilities; it guarantees them 'full and equal enjoyment.'" Baughman v. Walt Disney World Co., 685 F.3d 1131, 1135 (9th Cir. 2012); 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). The concept of discrimination under the ADA includes obviously exclusionary conduct and "more subtle forms of discrimination — such as difficult-to-navigate restrooms and hard-to-open-doors that interfere with disabled individuals' 'full and [*15]  equal enjoyment' of places of public accommodation." Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 945 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a)); see also Doran v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 524 F.3d 1034, 1041 at fn. 4 (9th Cir. 2011) (the ADA "does not limit its antidiscrimination mandate to barriers that completely prohibit access.").
To establish a violation of Title III of the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she is an individual with a disability; (2) the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) the plaintiff was denied public accommodations by the defendant because of her disability. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182(a)-(b); Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 730 (9th Cir. 2007); Arizona ex rel. Goddard v. Harkins Amusement Enter. Inc., 603 F.3d 666, 670 (9th Cir. 2010).
Facilities constructed or altered after January 26, 1993 must "be 'readily accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities'" Long v. Coast Resort, Inc., 267 F.3d 918, 923 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting 42. U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1)). For these facilities the only statutory defense for non ADA compliance is structural impracticability which is available "only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features." 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1). For grandfathered facilities, meaning those designed and constructed for occupancy before January 26, 1993, discrimination includes "a failure to remove architectural barriers [] . . . in existing facilities . . . where such removal is readily achievable." Id. at § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv); Long, 267 F.3d at 923 [*16] ; Hubbard v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1137 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 9, 2016).

1. Public Accommodation.
A threshold issue between the parties is whether or not the Gliderport is a public accommodation as defined by the ADA. Defendants argue that "the Gliderport, because it is a coastal bluff, is not a place of public accommodation so it is not amenable to the strictures of federal or state disability access laws." [Doc. No. 47-1 at 9:13-15.] Plaintiffs' position is that the services and activities offered at the Gliderport render it a public accommodation and therefore subject to the ADA. [Doc. No. 60-1 at 9-10.]
Whether a particular facility is a "public accommodation" under the ADA is a question of law. See, e.g., Carparts Distrib. Ctr. v. Auto. Wholesaler's Ass'n, 37 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 1994); Kotev v. First Colony Life Ins. Co., 927 F. Supp. 1316, 1320-1323 (C.D. Cal. May 30, 1996); Jankey v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 14 F. Supp. 2d 1174, 1178 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 1998). "The determination of whether a facility is a "public accommodation" for purposes of coverage by the ADA therefore turns on whether the facility is open 'indiscriminately to other members of the general public.'" Jankey, 14 F. Supp. 2d at 1178 (citations omitted).
The ADA lists the types of private entities that are considered "public accommodations" and includes:
(B) a restaurant, bar, or other establishment serving food or drink;
(C) a motion picture house, theater, concert hall, stadium, or other place of exhibition or entertainment;
(D) an auditorium, convention [*17]  center, lecture hall, or other place of public gathering;
(I) a park, zoo, amusement park, or other place of public display or collection;
(L) a gymnasium, health spa, bowling alley, golf course, or other place of exercise or recreation.
42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)2 .
It is undisputed that the Gliderport is a city-owned private-use glider airport located in Torrey Pines, San Diego. [Doc. No. 1 at ¶ 13.] While neither party has specifically addressed whether the Gliderport was indiscriminately open to the public the lease between the City and Air California Adventures, LLC for the use of the Torrey Pines Gliderport specifically provides for Public Use: [t]he general public shall not be wholly or permanently exclude from any portion of the premises... the Flight Director/Lessee shall, at all times during the lease term, maintain a CITY-approved sign identifying the property as City-owned and available for public use. [Doc No. 50-11 at 1.10.]
The ADA does not expressly identify a gliderport as a specific place of public accommodation, but that does not preclude it from being subject to the ADA. In deciding whether a gliderport is a public accommodation in the absence of an express designation, the inquiry is whether [*18]  its inclusion furthers the ADA's purpose. See for example Nicholls v. Holiday Panay Marina, L.P., 173 Cal. App. 4th 966, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 309 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009) (finding a privately owned marina that rents docks to the public is a public accommodation); Jankey, 14 F. Supp. 2d 1174 (areas of film studio visited by public tour were required to comply with ADA, but areas not part of the tour need not comply); Indep. Living Res. v. Oregon Arena Corp., 982 F. Supp. 698 (D. Or. Nov. 12, 1997) (private executive suites in a sports arena were public accommodations).
By enacting the ADA, Congress intended the "integration of persons with disabilities into the economic and social mainstream of American life." Helen L. v. DiDario 46 F.3d 325, 331 (3d Cir. 1995) (italics omitted). A person confined to a wheelchair ought to be able to enjoy the social and recreational pleasures of hang gliding, paragliding and/or the refreshments offered on the site to the greatest extent consistent with his/her physical limitations. The Gliderport's inaccessibility to Plaintiffs' wheelchairs limits their access to the activities and services offered there. The ADA's application to places of public exhibition or entertainment, places of public gathering, places of display or collection, places of exercise and recreation, or establishments serving food or drink aims to remove those limits. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Gliderport is a public accommodation as defined [*19]  or contemplated by 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7) and 42 U.S.C. § 12182.

2. Readily Achievable Standard
Neither party dispute that the Gliderport's existence predates the ADA. However, they disagree as to who bears the burden of establishing the applicability of the "readily achievable" doctrine [Doc. No. 47-1 at 16-17; Doc. No. 60-1 at 11.]
The term "readily achievable" is defined as being "easily accomplishable to able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense." 42 U.S.C. § 12181(9). Some factors to be considered in determining if an action is readily achievable are the nature and the cost of the action needed, the overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the action; the number of persons employed at the facility; the effect on expenses and resources or the impact upon the operation of the facility. 42 U.S.C. § 12181(9)(a-b).
The Ninth Circuit has yet to rule on who bears the burden of proof in showing that removal of an architectural barrier is readily achievable. Vogel v. Rite Aid Corp., 992 F. Supp. 2d 998, 1010 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 17, 2014). Various courts, throughout the Circuit, have often applied the burden-shifting framework set forth in Colorado Cross Disability Coalition v. Hermanson Family L.P., 264 F.3d 999 (10th Cir. 2001).3 Under Colorado Cross, plaintiff bears the initial burden of production to present evidence that removal of the barrier is readily achievable. Id. at 1006. If Plaintiff does so, Defendant [*20]  then bears the ultimate burden of persuasion that barrier removal is not readily achievable. Id. at 1002-03. While it is true that courts within this district have declined4 to follow Colorado Cross and have placed the burden of production as well as the burden of persuasion on defendants to establish that remediation is not readily achievable it is far from "becoming clear" as Plaintiffs claim. [Doc. No. 60-1 at 16:25-27.] While plaintiff's burden differs depending on which standard is applied, "[d]efendants bear the ultimate burden of proving that removal is not readily achievable." Hubbard v. Rite Aid Corp., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1168 (S.D. Cal. May 4, 2006).
Notably, the Ninth Circuit has declined to apply Colorado Cross in the context of barrier removal from within historic buildings. Molski v. Foley Estates Vineyard and Winery, LLC, 531 F.3d 1043 (9th Cir. 2008). In Foley Estates, the Court placed the burden of production on defendants where it is asserted that remediation is not readily achievable due to the historic nature of the facility. The Court reasoned that defendants are the "party with the best access to information regarding the historical significance of the building . . . the defendant is [*21]  in a better position to introduce, as part of its affirmative defense, detailed evidence and expert testimony concerning whether the historic significance of a structure would be threatened or destroyed by the proposed barrier removal plan." Foley Estates, 531 F.3d at 1048.5
Here, Defendants assert the historical exception, but the parties disagree as to whether the historical designation and, by implication the burden shifting established in Foley Estates, is applicable to the site as a whole and the structures contained therein. Neither party dispute that the Gliderport is a site listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the California Register of Historical Places, and the City of San Diego Historic Site.
Defendants also argue that, for barriers not covered by the historical designation but covered by virtue of their grandfathered status, Plaintiffs have failed to make a prima-facie showing that removal of the alleged grandfathered barriers is "readily achievable." [Doc. No. 55-1 at 19-21.] In those instances Plaintiff bears the burden of suggesting a method of removing the barrier that is "easily accomplishable and [*22]  able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense." Hubbard, 433 F. Supp. 2d at 1159.
Plaintiffs' expert summarily stated that he "believes that each of these conditions can be corrected without any significant difficulty or expense." [Doc. No. 47-16 at 65] but his later declaration filed in support of Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment provides more detailed cost estimates and remediation plans. [Doc. No. 50-5.] Defendant's wish to have the later declaration of Mr. Bishop's stricken. If the Court were to grant Defendants' request then standing alone Plaintiffs' expert report would only offer the "conclusory statements" regarding remediation. [Doc 47-1, at 17; Doc. No. 63, at 5-6, 11] But, the Court declines to strike the declaration of Mr. Bishop. Defendants have had the opportunity to counter the information/facts contained in Mr. Bishop's declaration as evidenced by the declarations submitted from their own experts responding to Mr. Bishop's declaration. [Doc. No. 55-5; Doc. No. 55-6.] The Court will consider the declaration of Mr. Bishop regarding the restrooms, parking lot, concession stand, and picnic tables as part of the evidence provided by Plaintiffs to determine if they've met their burden to [*23]  illustrate that barrier removal could be "easily accomplishable" and carried out "without much difficulty or expense." Hubbard, 433 F. Supp. 2d at 1159.
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant ACA has abandoned its ability to argue or sustain a readily achievable defense because it failed to produce or identify the relevant information about its financial wherewithal. [Doc 60-1 at 17.] Defendant ACA submitted a declaration from the General Manager of the Gliderport [Doc 47-14] as well as expert declarations and reports [Doc. No. 47-16 at 67-78; Doc. No. 55-5; Doc No. 55-6] that explain the financial resources of the Gliderport and the nature and cost of the actions required to remediate the violations. Defendants also point out that "Plaintiffs took the deposition of the general manager of Air California, Inc. and were provided with gross revenue information net revenue information, employee numbers, approximate salaries, and the like." [Doc. No. 63 at 16.] The Court finds the submitted evidence sufficient to establish that Defendants have not abandoned or waived the readily achievable defense.
The Court will look at each barrier in turn to see if the readily achievable standard is applicable and if the parties have met their [*24]  initial burdens regarding this standard in order to survive summary judgment. Bearing in mind that whether or not a specific change is readily achievable is "a fact-intensive inquiry that is rarely decided on summary judgment." McIver v. Cal. Exposition & Fair, No. 01-1967, 2005 WL 1541087, at *1 (E.D. Cal. June 28, 2005) (quoting D'Lil v. Stardust Vacation Club, No. 00-1496, 2001 WL 1825832, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2001)); Rodriguez v. Barrita, No. C 09-04057 RS, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91749, 2012 WL 3538014 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 1, 2012); Colorado Cross, 264 F.3d 999.

3. Architectural Barriers
The parties take opposing positions on each alleged architectural barrier and make arguments specific to each individual claim. Thus, the Court will review each claim violation in turn.

i. Parking Lot
Neither party disputes that the parking lot located at the Gliderport is not ADA compliant but disagree as to whether the requested remediation is readily achievable. Defendants advance multiple reasons why they believe that the parking lot cannot be remediated, all are predicated on their assumption that the remedy being sought is the grading and paving of the dirt lot located on an ocean bluff.6 Since Defendants have asserted the historical exception in relation to the parking lot they therefore must bear the initial burden of production as well as the ultimate burden of persuasion in establishing that remediation is not readily achievable. See Foley Estates, 531 F.3d 1043.
Parking at the Gliderport is offered without fee [*25]  to the public in a large sand lot which does not designate parking stalls. [Doc. No. 55-3 at 6:1-3.] The Gliderport has assigned the area of the sand closest to the concession area as a disabled space. [Id. at 5:7-10.]
Defendants have proffered cost estimates and a brief explanation outlining the construction difficulties with the remediation that satisfies their initial burden to show that remediation is not readily achievable. Defendants claim that creating a parking lot upon the coastal bluff would cost approximately $400,000. [Doc. No. 47-16 at 72.] Second, Defendants claim that not only is the site one of historical significance due to its role in aviation history but Native American artifacts have also been found on the site and it is an area of biologically sensitive ecosystem. [Id. at 71-72, 76.] Defendants position is that the presence of native artifacts necessitates the involvement of multiple agencies including the California Coastal Commission, U.S. Department of Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the permitting process, and that this process could take approximately 2 1/2 to 3 years to conclude with costs for consulting services and permits that could easily exceed $200,000. [ [*26] Id.]
Plaintiffs' expert provides a number of alternative methods of providing accessible parking that do not entail the paving and structural changes that Defendants suggest is necessary, for example using paving stones or segregating the accessible parking spaces with ropes or cones and adding appropriate signage that would cost around $2,500.7 [Doc. No. 50-5 at ¶¶ 51-59.] Plaintiffs' expert also contends that the permitting process is not as onerous at Defendants have presented and that as long as the subsurface resources at the site are not being disturbed then they do not foresee any objections from the local tribal counsel. [Id. at ¶¶ 60-61.]
Defendants in turn have submitted declarations from their experts that explain why Plaintiffs' alternative plans, are not readily achievable. [Doc. No. 55-5; Doc. No. 55-6.] Specifically, Messrs. Valine and Bernet claim that Mr. Bishop is downplaying the cost and difficulty of laying pavers in the parking lot and overlooking the need to involve multiple regulatory agencies in the process. [Doc. No. 55-5 at ¶¶ 7-8; Doc. No. 55-6 at ¶¶ 9-14.] Defendants also argue that ACA cannot justify the monetary outlay required to make the changes to the coastal [*27]  bluff as it is a small business with a net income of approximately $175,000 on a month-to-month lease. [Doc No. 47-14 at ¶ 14.]
There are many contested factual issues concerning the cost and type of remediation being requested surrounding the parking lot summary. Summary judgment on the ADA claims based on the absence of disabled parking at the Gliderport is inappropriate, both Motions on this claim are therefore DENIED.

ii. Portable Restrooms
After the initiation of the present litigation, ACA replaced one of the original portable toilets with a portable toilet displaying the International Symbol of Accessibility ("ISA"). [Doc No. 47-14 at ¶ 8; Doc. No. 50-5 at ¶ 20; Doc. No. 50-7 at 1-4, 6; Doc No. 55-3 at 7.] Defendants claim that by bringing in a disabled accessible portable restroom they have corrected the violation rendering Plaintiffs' claim moot. [Doc. No. 47-1 at 7.]
An ADA claim becomes moot once the defendant corrects the violation because "[d]amages are not recoverable under Title III of the ADA—only injunctive relief is available for violations of Title III." Oliver v. Ralphs Grocery Co., 654 F.3d 903, 905 (9th Cir. 2011); Wander v. Kaus, 304 F.3d 856, 858 (9th Cir. 2002). Accordingly, Plaintiff's ADA claim can only proceed if there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning a [*28]  continuing ADA violation or if Plaintiff establishes a continuing violation. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on violations if the violations have been remedied. Wander, 304 F.3d at 858.
Plaintiffs contend that the new portable toilet is not ADA complaint in numerous ways. [Doc No. 50-1 at 8-9, 19-21; Doc. No. 60-1 at 6-7, 13-14.] The declaration from Plaintiffs' expert provides multiple examples of how the ISA toilet was not ADA compliant, for example: the door only opens 31 inches, the door handle is not easy to use, inside the toilet only 57 inches diameter clear turning circle was provided, the toilet seat had a height of 19.5 inches, and the grab bars were not correctly placed. [Doc. No. 50-5 at ¶¶ 21-22, 25-27.] Additionally, the ISA toilet was secured by a padlock, the highest operable part of which was more than 58 inches above the ground and a sign posted on its' exterior indicated that it was to only be used by pilots. [Id. at ¶¶ 23-24; Doc. No. 50-7 at 2-4, 6.] Defendants' own experts concede that the replacement toilet although larger than a standard portable toilet "does not fully comply with ADA standards for turning spaces, seat height, and handrails" and discuss finding a "fully [*29]  compliant leasable ADA portable toilet" locally. [Doc. No. 47-16 at 73, 77.] In light of these continuing ADA violations the Court finds that the claim surrounding the portable toilet is not moot.
Like the other claims, the parties dispute how 'readily achievable' it is to replace the ISA toilet with one that is ADA compliant. In their summary judgment motion Defendants had originally argued that the cost of remediating the restroom violation would cost approximately $200,000, which indicated that it was not readily achievable for a small business such as ACA. [Doc. No. 47-1 at 12; Doc. No. 47-14 at ¶ 10.] This argument was based on Defendants assumption that they'd have to construct a new restroom facility that would require permitting, connection to sewer and electrical grids, etc. [Id.]. Once the permanent structures were removed from the analysis the parties continued to focus on whether the requested remediation, i.e. replacing the current ISA toilet with one that is ADA compliant is, "readily achievable."
However, the Court finds application of the "readily achievable" standard to the portable restroom claim inappropriate. Neither party can claim that the ISA portable toilet is [*30]  related to the "existing facility" (the Gliderport) to such an extent that it would justify application of this "less stringent standard" than the structural impracticability one that actually applies. See Foley Estates 531 F.3d at 1051. The record is clear that the ISA toilet was placed at the site in February 2015. [Doc. No. 47-14 at ¶ 8.] Therefore the only defense for non ADA compliance is structural impractically. 42 U.S.C § 12183(a)(1); Long, 267 F.3d at 923; see also D'Lil v. Riverboat Delta King, Inc., 59 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1011-1013 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 25, 2014). Defendants have not pled structurally impracticality as an affirmative defense and have not put forth any evidence that replacing the ISA toilet with an ADA compliant one would be structurally impracticable. Furthermore, replacing one non-ADA compliant portable toilet with an ADA compliant one will have absolutely no effect on the historic nature of the Gliderport. While the parties disagree about the actual cost of renting or purchasing an ADA compliant portable toilet, the dispute is not material to this specific claim.8
Defendants also make the alternate argument that even if the portable toilet in question is not disable accessible, section 213.2.3 of the 2010 Americans with Disabilities Act Standards relieves Defendants of any responsibility to provide a toilet at all, and there are no minimum [*31]  number of restrooms necessary under this standard. [Doc. No. 55 at 11, 22; Doc. No. 63 at 10] Defendants cite to the specific language of section 213.2.3 that provides "Where multiple single use portable toilet or bathing units are clustered at a single location, no more than 5 percent of the toilet units and bathing units at each cluster shall be required to comply with 606." [Doc. No. 63 at 10:6-10.] Defendants argue that based on the language of section 213.2.3 "any number of toilets out of the four at the site would exceed 5%. Thus, Plaintiffs' claims fail because their theory of liability would contravene this regulation." [Doc. No. 55 at 11:15-24; Doc. No. 63 at 10:12-14.] The Court finds this extremely narrow interpretation of this standard questionable and misplaced.
Defendants final argument surrounding the portable toilets is that since neither Plaintiff attempted to use the restroom they cannot claim they were denied access. [Doc. No. 55 at 25-26; Doc. No. 63 at 10.] However, they are not required to have physically encountered every barrier to bring an ADA claim. See Parr v. L & L Drive-Inn Restaurant, 96 F. Supp. 2d 1065, 1081 (D. Hawaii, May 16, 2000) ("Plaintiffs have standing to allege ADA violations which they did not encounter as long as Plaintiffs are 'among the injured'" quoting [*32]  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 563, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992)).
The ADA does not require a disabled person to "engage in a futile gesture if such a person has actual notice that a person or organization covered by this subchapter does not intend to comply with its provisions. 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1). Actual notice of intent not to comply with the ADA is sufficient. See Jankey, 14 F. Supp. 2d at 1180; D'Lil, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22788, 1997 WL 714866, at *4 ("[A] plaintiff need not repeatedly suffer discrimination in order to assert [rights] under Title III.); Schonfeld v. City of Carlsbad, 978 F. Supp. 1329, 1332 (S.D. Cal. 1997) (finding that as to Article III standing, an ADA Plaintiff alleging inadequate access to a facility is not required to have "'formally' requested to use the facility.")
Plaintiffs submitted the declaration of their expert that detailed the alleged violations relating to the ISA toilet that was installed at the site after Plaintiffs visits. [Doc. No. 50-5 at ¶¶ 12-29]. Therefore, Plaintiff had "actual notice" through their own expert's findings that Defendants did not intend to comply with the ADA.
The Court finds that Plaintiffs have presented evidence that show that the new portable toilet is not ADA complaint, and as discussed above, finds the readily achievable standard inapplicable to this claim. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on this portion of their claim. Defendants' [*33]  Motion is DENIED.

iii. Concession Stand
Plaintiffs have submitted testimony and evidence, including photos that illustrate that the counter is non-ADA compliant. [Doc. No. 50-3 at ¶ 11; Doc. No. 50-4 at ¶ 11; Doc. No. 50-5 at ¶ 31; Doc. No. 50-8 at 2, 5.] Defendants do not dispute the fact that the counter at the concession stand is not ADA complaint and in fact concede that "[t]here is no accessible counter at the existing concession stand that complies with current ADA standards for width and height." [Doc. No. 47-16 at 73, 77.]
Rather, the parties dispute whether the concession stand, by virtue of its age and its existence at the time of the historical designation, is excluded from ADA compliance. In support of their position that modifications to the concession stand do not fall under the historical designation of the Gliderport, Plaintiffs note that in the Gliderport's historical designation report the trailer "is not of historic value." [Doc. No. 47-6 at 8.] Defendants claim that the trailer is part of the historic designation which complicates whether or not it can be changed, how changes could be made and would require permitting from outside authorities. [Doc. No. 63 at 10.] [*34]  Defendants also argue that since the trailer containing the concession stands has not structurally changed since January 26, 1993 retrofitting is not required. [Doc. No. 47-1 at 20; Doc. No. 47-14 at ¶ 13.]
Under either the historic designation exception or the grandfathered facilities exception, the initial inquiry is whether removal of the barrier is readily achievable. Defendants argue that they have provided an alternative plan that renders them compliant with the law and gloss over the "readily achievable analysis." Defendants ask for summary judgment based on the conclusory assumption that the required remediation is not readily achievable and that all they need to do was provided an alternative, which they have done. [Doc. No. 47-1 at 20; Doc. No. 47-14 at ¶ 11; Doc. No. 47-16 at 73; Doc. No. 55 at 12, 26; Doc. No. 63 at 12.] But the availability of alternative methods of access only come into play after it's been established that the requested modifications are not readily achievable — that fact has not been decided here and is a matter of dispute between the parties.
The parties have presented conflicting evidence as to whether or not the remediation of the barrier at the concession [*35]  stand is readily achievable. Plaintiffs have submitted evidence that alterations to the concession area would cost between $1,000-$2,000 and accomplished relatively easily. [Doc. No. 50-5 at ¶¶ 34, 35.] Defendants have provided conflicting evidence that the requested remediation, may involve permits, be more extensive than Plaintiffs' expert suggested, and would minimally cost $6,992.00 [Doc. No. 47-16 at 73-74, 78; Doc. No. 55-5 at ¶¶ 4-5.] Defendants conclude that this cost is unreasonable considering the financial circumstances of ACA. [Doc. No. 55 at 24.]
Material questions of fact exist surrounding the ease by which remediation of the ADA claims concerning the concession stand. Accordingly, both Motions for Summary Judgment of this claim are DENIED.

iv. Picnic Tables
Defendants argue that because the picnic tables were not included in Plaintiffs' Complaint there is insufficient notice of this claim to proceed. [Doc. No. 63 at 13.] However, the Complaint includes a list of barriers that Plaintiffs encountered and within the Concessions/Snack Bar subsection it states "and the seating is all picnic table style." [Doc. No. 1 at ¶ 15.]
Plaintiffs have submitted evidence in support of their [*36]  position that, on the dates of their visits, the dining surfaces available near the concession stand were all picnic tables with fixed benches that provided no clear knee space. [Doc. No. 50-3 at ¶ 13; Doc. No. 50-4 at ¶ 13; Doc. No. 50-5 at ¶ 37; Doc. No. 50-9 at 1-5.] According to Plaintiffs' expert, disable accessible picnic tables can be purchased on line for as little as $700. [Doc. No. 50-5 at ¶ 40.]
Defendants counter that the tables at the Gliderport are ADA compliant, however, Defendants' experts states that "there are existing picnic tables at the site that are not fully compliant with current ADA standards" and that "a compliant picnic table can be located at the site." [Doc. No. 47-16 at 74, 48.] In contrast to Plaintiffs' expert, Defendants' expert estimates the cost of purchasing the picnic tables to be approximately $200 more and would require assembly by a carpenter that would increase costs even further [Doc. No. 55-5 at ¶ 6] for a total remediation cost of around $1,702.40. [Doc. No. 47-16 at 74.]
Again the parties are focusing on whether the requested remediation is "readily achievable." But the Court finds that application of the "readily achievable" standard is not [*37]  appropriate in relation to the picnic table claim because their existence is not intertwined with the Gliderport's. They are simply outdoor picnic tables that at some point in time have been placed at a property that has existed since before 1993, so the inquiry is focused on the existence of a violation. Whether or not these picnic tables are ADA compliant is a material fact in dispute, therefore summary judgment on this ADA claim is not appropriate. Both Defendants' and Plaintiffs' Motions for Summary Judgment on the picnic table claims are DENIED.

v. Pedestrian Paths of Travel
Plaintiffs' complaint included a claim that the pedestrian paths of travel at the Gliderport were not ADA compliant. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment makes no mention of this claim and only challenges the accessibility of the parking lot, restrooms, concessions counter and picnic tables at the Gliderport. Plaintiffs' Opposition is also silent regarding the alleged paths of travel violations. The Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs have abandoned this claim.

4. Conclusion Regarding Title III Claims
Whether fixing the ADA violations related to the parking lot and concessions counter is readily achievable [*38]  is clearly in dispute and present triable issues of fact. Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the ISA portable toilet is not ADA compliant and is entitled to summary judgment on this portion of their claim. Triable issues of fact exist regarding the picnic tables. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on the Title III claims and DENIES IN PART AND GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs' Title III claims.

C. Failure to Join Coastal Commission
Defendants make an additional argument that judgment on the Title III claim should be entered in their favor because neither the City of San Diego nor ACA can "unilaterally make the alterations requested here" because the California Coastal Commission asserts original permitting jurisdiction of California Coastal bluffs including the bluff where the Gliderport sits. [Doc. No. 47, p.23:27 - 24:4]
Failure to join an indispensable party "may not be determined on a motion for summary judgment because it does not go to the merits of the law suit, not does it bar an action on the subject matter, but only operates to abate that particular action." Dredge Corp. v. Perry, 338 F.2d 456, 463 (9th Cir. 1964). The question of whether the Coastal Commission is an indispensable party is therefore not [*39]  properly before the Court.

D. State Law Claims
Both parties move for summary judgment on the California's Unruh Civil Rights Act ("Unruh Act") and The California Disabled Persons Act ("CDPA") claims.

1. Unruh Act Claim
The Ninth Circuit has held that violating the ADA is a per se violation of the Unruh Act. Lentini v. Cal. Ctr. for the Arts, 370 F.3d 837, 847 (9th Cir. 2004). See Cal. Civ. Code § 51(f) (providing that "[a] violation of the right of any individual under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ... shall also constitute a violation of this section"). When an Unruh Act claim is premised on a violation of the ADA, a plaintiff need not show intent. See Cal. Civ. Code § 51(f); Munson v. Del Taco, Inc., 46 Cal. 4th 661, 670, 94 Cal. Rptr. 3d 685, 208 P.3d 623 (Cal.2009) ("We conclude that a plaintiff proceeding under section 51, subdivision (f) may obtain statutory damages on proof of an ADA access violation without the need to demonstrate additionally that the discrimination was intentional.").
Plaintiffs have established that they encountered an ADA violation on March 11, 2013 and March 13, 2013, and in September 2014 and therefore have established Unruh Act violations. See Org. for Advancement of Minorities with Disabilities v. Heights Inn, No. C 04-03368 JSW, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66451, 2006 WL 2560754 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 5, 2006) ("[R]ecent authority holds that statutory damages under [the Unruh Act] are limited to each time that a plaintiff visits (or is deterred from visiting) [*40]  a non-compliant establishment...").
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment on the Unruh Act claim and DENIES Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on this claim.

2. CDPA Act Claim
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring a CDPA claim because the Act requires Plaintiffs to demonstrate that "on a particular occasion they were denied access." [Doc. No. 47-1 at 27:19-20.] Plaintiffs counter that actual denial is not required, that the focus should be on whether the access was full and equal.
The CDPA provides that "[i]ndividuals with disabilities shall be entitled to full and equal access, as other members of the general public, to accommodations, advantages, facilities, ... and privileges of all . . . places of public accommodation, amusement, or resort, and other places to which the general public is invited. . . ." Cal. Civ. Code § 54.1(a). The CDPA also provides that a violation of an individual's rights under the Disabilities Act also constitutes a violation of the CDPA. Id. at § 54(c).
In order "to maintain an action for damages pursuant to [the CDPA] an individual must . . . establish [] that he or she was denied equal access on a particular occasion." Antoninetti v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 643 F.3d 1165, 1177 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Donald v. Café Royal, Inc., 218 Cal. App. 3d 168, 183, 266 Cal. Rptr. 804 (Cal Ct. App. 1990)) (emphasis [*41]  omitted); Reycraft v. Lee 177 Cal. App. 4th 1211, 1215, 99 Cal. Rptr. 3d 746 (2009). To pursue a cause of action for damages under the CDPA requires something more than mere awareness of or a reasonable belief about the existence of a discriminatory condition. Reycraft, 177 Cal. App. 4th at 1222; Donald, 218 Cal. App. 3d at 183.
Defendants rely on Donald for the proposition that since Plaintiffs have never been denied access they cannot bring suit, but overstate it's finding by overlooking the "equal" part of the access inquiry. In Donald, the disabled plaintiff went to eat at a restaurant where the dining room was on the upper tiers. Id. at 173. Plaintiff was told that the restaurant could accommodate him by either seating him at a wheelchair accessible table that was on the ground floor adjacent to the bar or in the alternative an employee offered to carry plaintiff up the stairs to the dining area. Id. at 173-174. Plaintiff declined to be lifted because of the danger he might be dropped and because of the attention he would attract and departed the restaurant without eating. Id. at 174. The Court held that Plaintiff was able to establish standing by showing he actually presented himself to the restaurant on a particular occasion, as any other customer would do, with the intent of being seated at a table to be served and to purchase food and/or beverages [*42]  in the manner offered. In doing so, he could show that actually encountered access to seating inside the restaurant that was not full and equal. He therefore had standing and was entitled to recover damages under section 54.3. Donald, 218 Cal. App. 3d at 173-183.
Here, Plaintiffs presented themselves at the Gliderport, with the intent of using the services/facilities offered there and to watch the sailplanes, hang gliders, and paragliders. While at the Gliderport, Plaintiffs were unable to use the portable restrooms, were unaware of the existence of a toilet at the concession stand that may be wheelchair accessible, found only one parking spot designated for disable use, and encountered a concession stand with a counter that was too high for them. [Doc. No. 47-16 at 16-21, 39, 40-42, 43; Doc. No 50-3; Doc. No. 50-4.] The existence of a policy at the Gliderport that trains employees to ask disabled individuals whether they need any assistance upon their appearance at the Gliderport, allowing disabled patrons to use a staff restroom or having a side door that can be used for ordering from the concession stand does not mean that Plaintiffs had equal access. [Doc. No. 47-14 ¶¶ 9, 11] Neither does the fact that they used some of the [*43]  services and facilities offered demonstrate equal access.
Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have standing to pursue their CPDA claim and that they were in fact denied full and equal access to the Gliderport. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment on the CDPA claim is GRANTED. Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment on this claim is DENIED.

IV. Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, it is HEREBY ORDERED:
1) Defendants' motion for summary judgment [Doc. No. 47] is DENIED;
2) Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment [Doc. No. 50] is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART as follows:
a. GRANTED as to Plaintiffs':
i. Title III ADA claim related to the portable toilets;
ii. California's Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 51 et seq. claim;
iii. California's Disabled Persons Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 54.1 et seq. claim;
b. DENIED as to Plaintiffs:
i. Title II of the American with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §12131 et seq. claim;
ii. Title III of the American with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §12182 et seq. regarding the parking lot, concession stand and picnic table claims.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
