MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER
A group of former employees of the District of Columbia Office on Aging have brought this action alleging that the agency discriminated against its workers on the basis of age, and that it retaliated against those who complained. Consolidated Compl. [Dkt. # 22]. Plaintiffs Chantelle Teasdell, Glendora Meyers, Jamal Jones, Antonio Moreno, Jr., Adrian Reed, and Veronica Butler sue the District and their former supervisors, Dr. John M. Thompson and Camille Williams. Id. They bring claims for violations of the District of Columbia Whistleblower [*2]  Protection Act ("DCWPA"), D.C. Code § 1-615.51 et seq., the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA"), 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., the D.C.

Code § 2-1401 et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., and the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 298-360. Defendants have moved to dismiss several of the claims against them and for partial summary judgment. Defs.' Partial Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. # 26] ("D.C. & Thompson Mot"); Def. 's Partial Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. # 31] ("Williams Mot"); D.C.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. [Dkt. # 35] ("Summ. J. Mot.").
For the reasons discussed below, the motions will be granted in part and denied in part. Counts I, III, V, VI and the ADEA retaliation claim in Count VII will proceed in full. The FLSA claims brought by plaintiffs Jones and Reed in Count II will proceed, but the FLSA claims brought by plaintiffs Teasdell and Meyers will be dismissed. The DCHRA claims brought in Counts W and VII will proceed for all plaintiffs, except to the extent those claims seek unliquidated damages for injuries that occurred prior to May 2, 2015. Plaintiffs' claims for intentional [*3]  and negligent infliction of emotional distress in Counts VIII and IX will be dismissed in their entirety. The First Amendment claims in Count X will be dismissed, with the exception of the claim brought by plaintiff Moreno, which will proceed. And finally, plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages against the District will continue at this time.

BACKGROUND

I. Factual Background
Plaintiffs were all employees of the District of Columbia Office on Aging, where defendant Thompson served as the Executive Director and defendant Williams served as his Chief of Staff. Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 20-21. Plaintiffs allege that defendants Thompson and Williams systematically discriminated against "older employees" and "would, if an employee fell out of their good graces for any reason, engage in a pattern of behavior to sabotage their employment at the agency by giving said employee impossible work requirements and deadlines, and treating the employee terribly until they resigned." Id. ¶¶ 23, 29.
Plaintiff Teasdell began working at the Office on Aging on January 3, 2011, first as a Program Analyst and later, as the Associate Director of the Aging and Disability Resource Center. Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 34-35, 40. Teasdell [*4]  claims that she was given additional responsibilities without pay increases, forced to be on call twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week, and required to work overtime without compensation. Id. ¶¶ 38, 41-42. She alleges that after she expressed concerns to Thompson and Williams about how work was being assigned to employees and to grant recipients in December 2013, and after she filed an internal report raising potential violations of overtime laws in March 2014, Thompson and Williams began to retaliate against her, culminating in her discharge without stated cause on March 27, 2014. Id. ¶¶ 43-45.
Plaintiff Moreno was hired in July 2012. Consolidated Compl. ¶ 55. He served as a Strategic Planner and later as the Manger of External Affairs and Communication, reporting directly to defendant Williams but receiving "most of his direction" from defendant Thompson. Id. 11156, 60-61, 74. Moreno alleges that defendant Williams told him that she wanted to terminate three older employees under his supervision and manufactured performance-based reasons to terminate them, over his objections. Id. ¶¶ 65, 69, 71-72. He maintains that Williams "force[d] him into complying to an illegal directive" by giving the [*5]  three employees inaccurate performance evaluations, and that after he told Williams she was "unfairly targeting these three employees because of their age," Thompson and Williams began to retaliate against him. Id. ¶¶ 78-80, 82-87, 95-97. He states that he was phased out in favor of a younger employee and ultimately terminated without cause on November 18, 2013, at the age of sixty-two. Id. ¶¶ 90-100, 103.
Plaintiff Meyers was hired in August 2012 as a Management Liaison Specialist, and she was later promoted to the position of Administrative Officer in charge of human resources. Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 104-107. In January 2014, she was given the additional responsibility of Facilities Specialist, which she alleges required her to work overtime, holidays, and weekends without compensation. Id. ¶¶ 112-13. She maintains that she "observed numerous violations of the FLSA," antidiscrimination laws, and other laws and regulations throughout her time with the agency, and that "[o]n at least ten occasions, [she] told Dr. Thompson and Ms. Williams that the Agency was in violation of federal overtime law and regulation." Id. ¶¶ 111, 118. In December 2013, after Meyers complained to Williams about [*6]  how poorly older employees at the agency were being treated, Thompson and Williams began retaliating against her and subjecting her to a hostile work environment. Id. ¶¶ 128, 136-48. In March 2014, she filed a complaint with the agency's General Counsel regarding her lack of compensation and the suspected violations of federal overtime law, drafted a memorandum on overtime policies, and disseminated this information to the agency's Executive Team. Id. ¶¶ 114-116. Meyers alleges that after she complained, she was terminated without stated cause on February 6, 2015, at the age of sixty-one, and was replaced with a younger, less-qualified employee. Id. ¶¶ 153-60.
Plaintiff Jones was hired in July 2013 as an Executive Assistant to defendant Thompson. Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 161-62. He states that he "was often authorized and ordered by Dr. Thompson and Ms. Williams to work nights and overtime," accumulating over 100 hours of overtime for which he maintains he was not compensated. Id. ¶ 164. After Jones refused to work additional overtime without pay in February 2014, he was terminated. Id. TT 166-67.
Plaintiff Butler began working for the agency as a Case Manager in January 2012, in connection [*7]  with a federally-funded grant program. Consolidated Compl. ¶ 169. She states that in September 2012, Thompson promoted her to be a Special Assistant, but began mistreating her after Butler's former supervisor confronted Thompson about confusion surrounding the promotion. Id. ¶¶ 171-85. Butler alleges that she was "stripped of her responsibilities as Special Assistant" in November 2012 and again in October 2013, and that she was denied the salary increase associated with her former title despite continuing to fulfill the role. Id. ¶¶ 186-88, 191-94, 197-99. She alleges that the mistreatment caused her to suffer panic attacks and anxiety, and that after she hired an attorney to file an EEOC complaint, Thompson and Williams "doub[l]ed their efforts to purge" her from the agency. Id. ¶¶ 205-12. Butler was terminated on September 23, 2015 at the age of seventy-three. Id. ¶¶ 217, 219.
Plaintiff Reed was hired by the agency in March 2003 as a Staff Assistant. Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 221-22. Reed states that he and defendant Thompson were friends prior to Thompson's joining the agency in 2011, id. ¶¶ 229-37, but soon after Thompson arrived, it became clear to Reed that Thompson and Williams [*8]  were "engaging in a systemic purge of older people from the Agency and that he himself was being targeted as well." Id. ¶ 242. He states that Thompson and Williams fabricated performance-based excuses to demote or fire Reed, and that after Reed began experiencing medical problems, the mistreatment intensified. Id. ¶¶ 243-44. He claims that Thompson would force Reed to walk with him to lunch despite knowing that Reed's medical problems made walking long distances difficult and painful. Id. ¶¶ 245-50. After undergoing surgery on his foot, which required a cast and the use of crutches, Reed sought an accommodation for his disability in the form of a closer parking spot, but his request was denied. Id. ¶¶ 252-53, 267-73. Reed was forced to take medical leave from April 2013 through January 2014, and he alleges that during his absence, Thompson falsely claimed that Reed had threatened his life, and Reed was barred from the agency building. Id. ¶¶ 275-82, 285-90. Reed states that he was forced to take additional medical leave in spring 2014 and "has been out on leave ever since," that he is owed overtime wages, and that the agency has canceled his insurance coverage. Id. ¶¶ 291-95.

II. Procedural [*9]  History
Plaintiffs Teasdell, Meyers, and Jones initiated this action on March 26, 2015, Compl. [Dkt. # 1], and on September 16,2015, the Court consolidated the matter with a related action brought by plaintiffs Moreno and Meyers against the same defendants. Order (Sept. 16, 2015) [Dkt. # 15]. On November 6, 2015, after the cases were merged, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint, adding plaintiffs Butler and Reed. Consolidated Compl.
The consolidated complaint contains ten counts. In Count I, plaintiffs Teasdell and Meyers allege that defendants violated the D.C. Whistleblower Protection Act by retaliating against them after they "reported the systemic and unlawful practice by the Agency to not pay its employees back pay and overtime." Id. ¶¶ 298-302. In Count II, plaintiffs Teasdell, Meyers, Jones, and Reed claim that defendants deprived them of overtime wages to which they were entitled under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Id. TT 303-18. In Counts III, W, and VII, plaintiffs Moreno, Butler, and Meyers contend that defendants violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the D.C. Human Rights Act by discriminating against them on the basis of age, retaliating against them, [*10]  and terminating their employment. Id. ¶¶ 319-30,338-42. In Counts V and VI, plaintiff Reed alleges that the District and defendant Thompson violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act by denying his request for a reasonable accommodation for his disability and refusing to engage in the interactive process. Id. ¶¶ 331-37. In Count VIII, plaintiffs Reed and Butler bring claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress against defendants Thompson and Williams — Reed against Thompson for falsely accusing Reed of threatening him, and Butler against Thompson and Williams for privately and publicly disparaging her. Id. ¶¶ 343-48. In Count IX, plaintiff Reed brings a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress against defendant Thompson for "ignoring [his] health and foot conditions," denying his accommodation request, making false accusations against him, and causing him physical injury. Id. ¶¶ 349-51. Finally, in Count X, plaintiffs Teasdell, Moreno, Meyers, Butler, and Reed allege that defendants violated the First Amendment by retaliating against plaintiffs for complaining about the wage and overtime violations and the age discrimination occurring within the [*11]  agency. Id. ¶¶ 352-60.
On December 24, 2015, the District and defendant Thompson moved to dismiss several of plaintiffs' claims — Counts II, V, VI, VIII, IX, and X — pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). D.C. & Thompson Mot.; Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of D.C. & Thompson Mot. [Dkt. # 26] ("D.C. ¶Thompson Mem.").1 On February 3, 2016, after she was served with process, defendant Williams also filed a partial motion to dismiss, and joined the motion filed by her co-defendants. Williams Mot.; Mot. to Join D.C. & Thompson Mot. in Parts Relating to Herself [Dkt. # 31] ("Williams Mem."). Plaintiffs opposed both motions on February 16, 2016. Pls.' Opp. to D.C. ¶Thompson Mot. [Dkt. # 32] ("Pls.' D.C. & Thompson Opp."); Pls.' Opp. to Williams Mot. [Dkt. # 33] ("Pls.' Williams Opp.").
On March 21, 2016, the District also filed a partial motion for summary judgment, alleging that plaintiffs' failure to provide it with notice of their claims pursuant to D.C. Code § 12-309 bars their DCHRA claims in Counts IV and VII. Summ. J. Mot.; Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Summ. J. Mot. [Dkt. # 35] ("Summ. J. Mem."). Plaintiffs opposed that motion on April 6, 2016. Pls.' Mem. in Opp. to Summ. J. Mot. [Dkt. # 36].

STANDARD OF REVIEW

I. Motion to Dismiss
"To [*12]  survive a [Rule 12(b)(6)] motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."' Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009), quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). A claim is facially plausible when the pleaded factual content "allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id., citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. "The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Id., quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. A pleading must offer more than "labels and conclusions" or a "formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action," id., quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, and "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id., citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.
When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court is bound to construe a complaint liberally in the plaintiff's favor, and it should grant the plaintiff "the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged." Kowal v. MCI Commc'ns Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276, 305 U.S. App. D.C. 60 (D.C. Cir. 1994). Nevertheless, the Court need not accept inferences drawn by the plaintiff if those inferences are unsupported by facts alleged in the complaint, nor must the [*13]  Court accept plaintiff's legal conclusions. See id.; see also Browning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242, 352 U.S. App. D.C. 4 (D.C. Cir. 2002). In ruling upon a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a court may ordinarily consider only "the facts alleged in the complaint, documents attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint, and matters about which the Court may take judicial notice." Gustave-Schmidt v. Chao, 226 F. Supp. 2d 191, 196 (D.D.C. 2002), citing EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624-25, 326 U.S. App. D.C. 67 (D.C. Cir. 1997).

II. Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party seeking summary judgment "bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). To defeat summary judgment, the non-moving party must "designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The mere existence of a factual dispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute [*14]  is "genuine" only if a reasonable fact-finder could find for the non-moving party; a fact is "material" only if it is capable of affecting the outcome of the litigation. Id. at 248; Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1241, 259 U.S. App. D.C. 115 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In assessing a party's motion, the court must "view the facts and draw reasonable inferences 'in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment motion.'" Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007) (alterations omitted), quoting United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962) (per curiam).

ANALYSIS

I. Count II: Fair Labor Standards Act
Defendants have moved to dismiss plaintiffs' FLSA claims on the grounds that Thompson and Williams cannot be held individually liable as "employers" under the FLSA, that plaintiffs Teasdell and Meyers are exempt from coverage under the statute, and that the overtime hours worked by plaintiffs Jones and Reed were not approved by their supervisors. D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 4-9; Williams Mem. at 4. The Court finds that the individual defendants can qualify as employers under the statute and that plaintiffs Jones and Reed are covered by the overtime provisions, but it concludes that plaintiffs Teasdell and Meyers are salaried employees exempt from the FLSA, and so the motions will be granted in part and denied in part.

A. Defendants Thompson and Williams can [*15]  be held individually liable as employers under the FLSA.
The FLSA imposes certain minimum standards regarding the wages that "employers" must pay their "employees." See 29 U.S.C. §§ 206-07. The statute defines the term "employer" to include "any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee and includes a public agency." Id. § 203(d). "To 'employ' includes 'to suffer or permit to work.' Morrison v. Int'l Programs Consortium, Inc., 253 F.3d 5, 10, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 301 (D.C. Cir. 2001), quoting 29 U.S.C. §§ 203(e)(1), 203(g). The Supreme Court has emphasized "the expansiveness of the Act's definition of 'employer.' Falk v. Brennan, 414 U.S. 190, 195, 94 S. Ct. 427, 38 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1973).
In this Circuit, courts "look at 'economic reality' rather than 'technical concepts' to determine employment status under the FLSA." Morrison, 253 F.3d at 11, quoting Goldberg v. Whitaker House Co-op., Inc., 366 U.S. 28, 33, 81 S. Ct. 933, 6 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1961). The D.C. Circuit has directed courts to consider "whether the alleged employer (1) had the power to hire and fire the employees, (2) supervised and controlled employee work schedules or conditions of employment, (3) determined the rate and method of payment, and (4) maintained employment records." Id. at 11, quoting Henthorn v. Dep't of Navy, 29 F.3d 682, 684, 308 U.S. App. D.C. 36 (D.C. Cir. 1994).
Here, granting plaintiffs the reasonable inferences to which they are entitled at this stage, the Court finds that they have plausibly alleged that defendants Thompson and Williams are "employers" under the FLSA. With regard to [*16]  the first of the Morrison factors, the consolidated complaint is replete with factual allegations regarding the defendants' hiring and firing authority: plaintiffs allege that Thompson and Williams directed the hiring of several employees as part of their alleged scheme to replace older workers, Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 32, 89, 150-51, 159; that they had control over promotions and employee performance evaluations, id. ¶¶ 63-64, 70, 78-79, 81-82, 100, 131, 171; and that they "would fire or demote" employees who were not in "their good graces," including plaintiffs. Id. ¶¶ 3, 23-24, 65-67, 69, 99, 134, 243.
Plaintiffs have also alleged sufficient facts to find that Thompson and Williams had control over work schedules and conditions of employment. They claim that the defendants gave employees "impossible work requirements and deadlines" to force them to resign, Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 23, 45(b), 96, 139; required staff to work overtime without pay, id. ¶¶ 48-49, 164-67; required plaintiff Teasdell "to keep her staff on call at all times" and made them work extra hours and weekends, id. ¶ 45(d); selected which employees could attend a training program, id. ¶¶ 123-26; controlled plaintiffs' [*17]  leave schedules, id. ¶¶ 145-47, 182-85, 211, 215, 256, 261, 278-79; and dictated the physical location of some of the plaintiffs' offices. Id. ¶¶ 45(e), 190, 202.
There are also factual allegations indicating that defendants Thompson and Williams determined the rate and method of payment for plaintiffs and the other agency employees. Plaintiffs maintain that defendants consistently required plaintiffs and other staff to work overtime without pay, Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 45(d), 47-48, 164-67; that defendant Thompson set the agency policy with regard to overtime, id. ¶ 111(b); and that defendant Thompson had control over the compensation promised to or received by plaintiffs Meyers and Butler. Id. ¶¶ 109, 187-88.
While there are fewer factual allegations that would support the conclusion that defendants Thompson and Williams maintained employment records, plaintiffs do allege that defendant Williams had a role in scheduling and conducting employee performance evaluations, Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 45(a), 62, 69, 81-82, and it is a fair inference at this stage that Thompson, as Executive Director of the agency, also had some role in the handling of such records. See id. ¶ 20. In any event, [*18]  the records are simply one factor to be considered, and the other three factors weigh heavily in favor of the finding that defendants Thompson and Williams qualify as "employers" under the FLSA.
Defendants do not engage with the Morrison factors;instead, they insist that "Congress 'never intended to impose individual liability on public employers under the FLSA.'" D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 9, quoting Saint-Jean v. D.C. Pub. Sch. Div. of Transp., No. 08-1769 RWR, 2011 WL 4443349, at *1 (D.D.C. June 20, 2011); see also Williams Mem. at 4 (same). But the court in Saint-Jean did not adopt defendants' position — it simply observed that the plaintiffs had not "rebutted the judicial doubt cited by the defendants that Congress ever intended to impose individual liability upon public employers under the FLSA." 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108643, 2011 WL 4443349, at *1. And it applied the Morrison factors when it reached its conclusion that the plaintiffs had "failed to demonstrate that the complaint alleges facts reflecting [the defendant's] status as an employer." 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108643, [WL] at *1-2.
Defendants also rely on Mitchell v. Chapman, 343 F.3d 811 (6th Cir. 2003), but that case involved claims under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), and the court's finding that "the FMLA's individual liability provision does not [*19]  extend to public agencies" was based on the unique structure, punctuation, and tabulation of that statute. Id. at 828-33. In fact, the court specifically emphasized that it "has not addressed a textual analysis of whether the FLSA imposes individual liability on public agency employers," as opposed to the FMLA. Id. at 633 n.27 (emphasis added). So, as a nonbinding opinion analyzing a different statute, Mitchell does not control the Court's analysis here. Accord Fraternal Order of Police Barkley Lodge # 60, Inc. v. Fletcher, 618 F. Supp. 2d 712,716-21 (W.D. Ky. 2008) (distinguishing Mitchell and concluding that "[t]he simplest and plain reading of the FLSA leads the Court to conclude that public employees who act directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer, including a public agency employer, in relation to an employee, may be held individually liability under the FSLA").2
The D.C. Circuit has not weighed in on this issue, but the cases upon which defendants rely do not support their position, which the Court finds to be contrary to the plain language of the statue. See 29 U.S.C. § 203(d) (defining "employer" as "any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee and includes a public agency") (emphasis added). [*20]  In consideration of the "the expansiveness of the Act's definition of 'employer,'" Falk, 414 U.S. at 195, and the fact-based inquiry set forth in Morrison, as well as the relevant case law, the Court concludes that an individual supervisor at a public agency may fall under the scope of the FLSA. Accord Lee v. Coahoma Cty., 937 F.2d 220, 226 (5th Cir. 1991) (finding that a sheriff with operational control of the department "clearly falls within the class of managerial personnel considered employers by the FLSA"); Fletcher, 618 F. Supp. 2d at 722 ("[T]he FSLA allows individual liability for public employers. Therefore, supervisory personal liability under the FLSA includes those who are employed by a public agency. However, it only includes those supervisors acting directly or indirectly in the interest of a public agency in relation to the employee."). So, defendants' motion to dismiss on this ground will be denied.

B. Plaintiffs Teasdell and Meyers are exempt from the FLSA's overtime provisions, but plaintiffs Jones and Reed are covered by the statute.
Defendants have also moved to dismiss Count II on the grounds that plaintiffs are not entitled to the protection of the FLSA's overtime provisions. D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 5-9.
"An employee is entitled to the federal minimum wage and overtime [*21]  unless specifically exempted by the FLSA." Cannon v. District of Columbia, 717 F.3d 200, 204, 405 U.S. App. D.C. 141 (D.C. Cir. 2013), citing Robinson-Smith v. Gov't Emps. Ins. Co., 590 F.3d 886, 892, 389 U.S. App. D.C. 46 (D.C. Cir. 2010). Showing that an employee is exempt from FLSA coverage is an affirmative defense, and an employer bears the burden of establishing that its employee falls within a recognized exemption. Radtke v. Lifecare Mgmt. Partners, 795 F.3d 159, 163, 417 U.S. App. D.C. 422 (D.C. Cir. 2015), citing Robinson-Smith, 590 F.3d at 891. FLSA exemptions are "narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them." Sandifer v. U.S. Steel Corp., 571 U.S. 220, 134 S. Ct. 870, 879 n.7, 187 L. Ed. 2d 729 (2014), citing Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U.S. 388, 392, 80 S. Ct. 453, 4 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1960).

1. Plaintiffs Teasdell and Meyers
The FLSA requires employers to pay a nonexempt employee "one-and-one half times his regular pay rate for work in excess of 40 hours per week." Lindsay v. Gov't Emps. Ins. Co., 448 F.3d 416, 419 n.1, 371 U.S. App. D.C. 120 (D.C. Cir. 2006), citing 29 U.S.C. § 207(a). But the FLSA exempts "any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity" from the overtime requirement. 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1). "To qualify as an exempt executive, administrative or professional employee . . . an employee must be compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week . . . ." 29 C.F.R. § 541.600(a). An employee is compensated on a "salary basis" if he "regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee's compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed." Id. § 541.602(a).
Here, defendants [*22]  have moved to dismiss the FLSA claims brought by plaintiffs Teasdell and Meyers on the grounds that they were salaried employees not entitled to overtime protection. D.C. ¶Thompson Mem. at 5-7. Plaintiffs concede that "they were classified by the District as exempt" from FLSA coverage, but they insist that the agency's leave policy — which required them "to take 'annual leave' hours when they had partial-day absences" — transformed them into nonexempt, covered employees because it reduced the amount of accrued paid leave plaintiffs could "redeem[ ] for cash payment at the end of employment." Pls.' D.C. & Thompson Opp. at 6-8; Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 307-09. In other words, plaintiffs claim, because "docking hours from [their] annual leave for absences of less than one day counts as a reduction of monetary compensation . . . they are not exempt employees under FLSA." Pls.' D.C. ¶Thompson Opp. at 6-8.
Plaintiffs' assertion that their annual leave "is a part of plaintiffs' employment compensation," Consolidated Compl. ¶ 308, is a legal conclusion not entitled to any weight, and it is counter to the plain language of the regulation. To qualify as an exempt salaried employee under section 541.602(a), the employee "must receive [*23]  the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked." 29 C.F.R. § 541.602(a). The inquiry therefore is tied to the employee's periodic salary, not their benefits — the regulation identifies an employee paid on a salary basis by focusing on the receipt "each pay period" of "a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee's compensation." Id. The regulation does not address annual leave benefits accrued throughout the duration of employment that may be redeemed for a cash payout at the conclusion of employment. So if plaintiffs were paid a set salary on a regular weekly or biweekly basis — a fact which they do not contest — their status under the FLSA is clear even if absences of less than one day may have ultimately reduced the additional benefit that would be available upon their departure from the agency.
This approach to the application of the regulation is consistent with binding precedent in this Circuit. In Cannon v. District of Columbia, 717 F.3d 200, 405 U.S. App. D.C. 141, the plaintiffs, retired police officers, alleged that the District deprived them of the minimum wage required under the FLSA when it began offsetting their government salaries by the amount of the pension payments [*24]  they were receiving based on prior employment with the District. Id. at 203. While the District admitted that "the amount each of these plaintiffs receives in their paychecks has fallen below" the salary basis threshold of $455 per week, it argued that the officers were nevertheless exempt salaried employees because "if these plaintiffs' [retirement] annuities are counted as compensation, they are paid well above $455 per week." Id. at 204-05.
The D.C. Circuit rejected the District's argument, and it strictly applied the text of the provision:
The crux of the dispute is whether [the plaintiffs] receive less than $455 per week in compensation . . . . [A]s the plaintiffs correctly argue, their compensation comes in the form of the salaries the District pays them. But the District slashed those salaries. As paychecks in evidence demonstrate, [the plaintiffs] did not actually receive $455 per week in pay once the District began applying the offset. Thus, the District cannot carry its burden of showing that these three plaintiffs are compensated "at a rate of not less than $455 per week."
Id.; accord Kinney v. District of Columbia, 994 F.2d 6, 8, 11, 301 U.S. App. D.C. 279 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (finding that employee subject to system where "his pay would be reduced, in hourly increments" for partial-day [*25]  absences if he did not have sufficient accrued leave "lack[ed] one of the characteristics explicitly identified in the . . . regulation on salaried pay"); Aiken v. Cly. of Hampton, 977 F. Supp. 390, 397 (D. S.C. 1997) ("Accrued leave and holiday pay are not a part of the predetermined pay Plaintiffs receive each workweek. Rather, they are fringe benefits Plaintiffs receive and their reduction is not equivalent to a reduction in pay.").
Here, plaintiffs Teasdell and Meyers do not claim that the pay they "actually received" each period was affected in any way by the leave policy — they state only that they were "docked hours from their annual leave," and that those deductions influenced the size of the "cash payment" they could receive "at the end of employment." Pls.' D.C. & Thompson Opp. at 8; Consolidated Compl. ¶ 308. So they cannot overcome defendants' showing that the salary basis exemption to the overtime provisions bars their FLSA claims, and defendants' motion to dismiss Count II will be granted as to those plaintiffs.3

2. Plaintiffs Jones and Reed
Defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs Jones and Reed were hourly employees subject to the FLSA's overtime protections, but they have moved to dismiss their overtime claims [*26]  on the grounds that the two plaintiffs failed to allege that the extra hours they worked were "authorized or ordered" by the agency, as required by the District's municipal regulations. D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 7-9, citing D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 6-B § 1138.2. Rather, defendants hypothesize, plaintiffs simply "felt that [they] needed to work more than 40 hours in some weeks in order to meet the demands of [the] job," and chose to do so without direction or permission from their supervisors. Id. at 7-8.
Defendants are correct that section 1138.2 of the D.C. Municipal Regulations provides that "entitlement to overtime may be extended . . . for hours of work authorized in excess of eight hours per day or forty hours per week. D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 6-B § 1138.2 (emphasis added). But both plaintiffs have plainly alleged that they were authorized, required, ordered, or otherwise directed to work in excess of their regular schedule by defendants Thompson and Williams. Plaintiff Jones states that he was Thompson's Executive Assistant, that he was "authorized and ordered by Dr. Thompson and Ms. Williams to work nights and overtime" for more than 100 uncompensated hours, and that he was terminated after refusing to work additional overtime [*27]  hours "authorized and ordered" by Thompson. Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 162-67. And plaintiff Reed alleges that "[d]efendants sometimes required [him] to work in excess of 40 hours a week without overtime compensation," and that "[b]etween January of 2014 and April or May of 2014, [he] worked a good deal of overtime that he was never compensated for." Id. ¶¶ 292, 315-16.
Construing the allegations of the complaint liberally and granting plaintiffs the reasonable inferences to which they are entitled at this stage, see Kowal, 16 F.3d at 1276, the Court finds that plaintiffs Reed and Jones have plausibly alleged that they were authorized and ordered to work overtime hours by defendant Thompson, the Executive Director of the agency, and defendant Williams, the Chief of Staff. So, defendants' motion to dismiss those plaintiffs' FLSA claims in Count II will be denied.

II. Count IV: D.C. Human Rights Act
Defendant Williams has moved to dismiss plaintiffs' DCHRA claims on the grounds that she "is exempt from individual liability" under the statute because she is not "a supervisor, or one who has extensive administrative authority for making work place policy." Williams Mem. at 4-5. But the DCHRA is a "remedial" statute [*28]  that "must be generously construed." Wallace v. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, 715 A.2d 873, 889 (D.C. 1998), quoting Simpson v. D.C. Off of Human Rights, 597 A.2d 392, 398 (D.C. 1991). It broadly defines "employer" as "any person who, for compensation, employs an individual[;] any person acting in the interest of such employer, directly or indirectly; and any professional association." D.C. Code § 2-1401.02(11).
In light of that expansive defmition, the D.C. Court of Appeals has expressly rejected the argument that "[b]ecause . . . a supervisor is not himself the employer, he cannot be held individually liable under the [DCHRA]," and it instead has concluded that individuals "who exercise[ ] extensive supervisory, management and administrative authority" can be held individually liable for discriminatory behavior. Purcell v. Thomas, 928 A.2d 699, 714-15 (D.C. 2007) (fmding that the President and Chief Operating Officer, who supervised the plaintiff, was "acting, directly or indirectly, in the interest of [the company] and hence fell within DCHRA's definition of employer"). Under that precedent, "[c]ourts have held individuals liable under the DCHRA when they were personally involved in the discriminatory conduct." Bilal-Edwards v. United Planning Org., 896 F. Supp. 2d 88, 97 n.13 (D.D.C. 2012) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (finding that it was "inappropriate" to dismiss individual capacity DCHRA claim against defendant who served as Chief of Staff and [*29]  Vice President of Administration).4
Here, Williams herself admits that "[s]he was the chief of staff" and "she administered the Office." Williams Mem. at 5. And plaintiffs allege that she exercised direct supervisory authority over employees, Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 45(a), 60, 75, 79, 85, 93-94, 109, 140, 163; managed employee workloads and work and leave schedules, id. ¶¶ 45(b), 45(d), 48, 96, 145-47, 164, 211, 215; played a role in hiring, promotion, demotion, and termination decisions, id. ¶¶ 63-66, 69-70, 89, 99, 150; and administered performance evaluations. Id. ¶¶45(a), 62, 81, 131. Furthermore, plaintiffs have alleged that Williams herself was individually responsible for the allegedly discriminatory conduct. See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 68, 79, 125, 127, 131, 159. At this early stage and granting plaintiffs the reasonable inferences to which they are entitled, the consolidated complaint contains sufficient factual allegations to state a plausible claim of supervisory liability against Williams under the DCHRA. So Williams's motion to dismiss Count W will be denied.

III. Counts V and VI: Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act
The District and defendant Thompson have moved to [*30]  dismiss plaintiff Reed's ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims in Counts V and VI because "a parking place is not an accommodation that an employer is required to provide," and because Reed "failed to properly participate [in] the interactive process" in requesting an accommodation for his disability. D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 9-13. Because the Court finds that plaintiff Reed's requested accommodation was not unreasonable as a matter of law, and because plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts, taken as true, to support the conclusion that he did not fail to participate in the interactive process in good faith, the Court will permit his ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims to proceed.5

A. Plaintiff Reed's request for a closer parking space was reasonable.
"The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act require the District to 'mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability."' Minter v. District of Columbia, 809 F.3d 66, 69, 420 U.S. App. D.C. 411 (D.C. Cir. 2015), quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). In general, "[d]etennining whether a particular type of accommodation is reasonable is . . . a contextual and fact-specific inquiry." Solomon v. Vilsack, 763 F.3d 1, 9, 412 U.S. App. D.C. 127 (D.C. Cir. 2014), citing Taylor v. Rice, 451 F.3d 898, 908, 371 U.S. App. D.C. 383 (D.C. Cir. 2006). "That is because the contours and demands of an employment position and the capacities of a workplace [*31]  can vary materially from employer to employer." Id. So "it is rare that any particular type of accommodation will be categorically unreasonable as a matter of law." Id. at 10.
In this case, plaintiff Reed requested an accommodation in the form of "closer parking in the Office's parking lot, so that he could get into the building more easily" while using crutches and wearing a cast on his foot. Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 266-68. On its face, this request is hardly unreasonable, and the Court would not be the first in this District to reach such a conclusion. See, e.g., Lenkiewicz v. Castro, 146 F. Supp. 3d 46, 53 (D.D.C. 2015) (finding the plaintiff's request "that she be given a parking space at [agency] headquarters and that her workstation be relocated" closer by was a reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act); Armstrong v. Reno, 172 F. Supp. 2d 11, 23 (D.D.C. 2001) (observing that requested accommodations under Rehabilitation Act of "a chair, a handicapped parking space, and a later lunch . . . were not especially burdensome").6 Furthermore, defendants offer no explanation whatsoever as to why such a request could not have been easily accommodated. In light of the "contextual and fact-specific" nature of the reasonableness inquiry, and without any binding precedent to the contrary,7 the Court [*32]  finds at this stage that plaintiff Reed's requested accommodation of a closer parking space was not unreasonable as a matter of law under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.8

B. Plaintiff Reed has plausibly alleged that he engaged in the interactive process.
Defendants have also moved to dismiss plaintiff Reed's failure to accommodate claims because he "did not engage in the interactive process required by the ADA [and the Rehabilitation Act] because he failed to provide his employer with a doctor's note showing he needed special parking." D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 11-13.
To respond to an accommodation request, "it may be necessary for the [agency] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation." Ward v. McDonald, 762 F.3d 24, 32, 412 U.S. App. D.C. 24 (D.C. Cir. 2014), quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). Often, "an employer needs information about the nature of the individual's disability and the desired accommodation — information typically possessed only by the individual or her physician." Id. at 31. Accordingly, "[w]hen the need for an accommodation is not obvious, an employer, before providing a reasonable accommodation, may require that the individual with a disability provide documentation of the need [*33]  for accommodation." Id. at 31-32, quoting Stewart v. St. Elizabeths Hosp., 589 F.3d 1305, 1309 (D.C. Cir. 2010). However, "[a]n individual seeking accommodation need not provide medical evidence of her condition in every case: ' [A]n employee confined to a wheelchair would hardly need a doctor's report to show that she needed help in getting to her workstation if this were accessible only by climbing a steep staircase.'" Id. at 31, quoting Langon v. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 959 F.2d 1053, 1058, 295 U.S. App. D.C. 49 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
Here, taking the allegations of the consolidated complaint as true, the Court finds that plaintiff Reed did not fail to engage in the interactive process by refusing to provide the agency with a doctor's note justifying his request for a closer parking space. First, Reed alleges that at the time of his accommodation request, he "had been sending the Office his medical information on a regular basis," Consolidated Compl. ¶ 270, and that "[t]hroughout his time on leave," "[h]e sent his verification of treatment documentation to Dr. Thompson [and] Ms. Williams." Id. ¶ 255. From these allegations, the Court can reasonably infer that the agency was in possession of at least some information about the nature of his disability. Second, and more importantly, Reed states that he "returned to work on crutches, while still wearing a cast on his [*34]  foot," that he was "hobbling around on crutches and in a cast," and that during the meeting in which he requested the accommodation, he "placed his cast foot loudly on the desk" and questioned why his cast was not "reason enough" to grant his request. Id. ¶¶ 266, 270-71. So it is not clear that he needed to "provide medical evidence of [his] condition" when his disability was obvious. See Ward, 762 F.3d at 31. For those reasons, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff Reed's failure to accommodate claims in Counts V and VI will be denied.

IV. Count VIII: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Defendants have also moved to dismiss the intentional infliction of emotional distress ("TIED") claims brought by plaintiffs Reed and Butler in Count VIII, on the grounds that plaintiffs have failed to allege that they were subjected to the sort of "extreme and outrageous" conduct that is required to support such a cause of action. D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 13-15; see also Williams Mem. at 5-7.9 The Court agrees.
In the District of Columbia, "[t]he tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress consists of (1) extreme and outrageous conduct on the part of the defendant which (2) intentionally or recklessly [*35]  (3) causes the plaintiff severe emotional distress." Kotsch v. District of Columbia, 924 A.2d 1040, 1045 (D.C. 2007). "As to the first element, ' Miability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.'" Id. at 1045-46, quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46, cmt. d. "It is for the court to determine, in the first instance, whether the defendant's conduct may reasonably be regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to permit recovery, or whether it is necessarily so." Newmyer v. Sidwell Friends Sch., 128 A.3d 1023, 1037 (D.C. 2015).
The D.C. Court of Appeals has consistently held that "employer-employee conflicts do not, as a matter of law, rise to the level of outrageous conduct" required to sustain an IIED claim Howard Univ. v. Best, 484 A.2d 958, 986 (D.C. 1984). Accordingly, courts "have been exacting as to the proof required to sustain such claims 'in an employment context.'" Futrell v. Dep't of Labor Fed. Credit Union, 816 A.2d 793, 808 (D.C. 2003), quoting Paul v. Howard Univ., 754 A.2d 297, 307 (D.C. 2000) ("[T]his court has been particularly demanding as to the proof required to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress in an employment context"); see also Kerrigan v. Britches of Georgetowne, Inc., 705 A.2d 624, 628 (D.C. 1997).

A. Plaintiff Butler
In support of her IIED claim, plaintiff Butler alleges that she "was demeaned multiple times both privately and publicly by Dr. Thompson and Ms. William's [*36]  [sic] to the extent that she began to experience near-syncopal episodes." Consolidated Compl. ¶ 344. She also alleges generally that Thompson discriminated against her by "isolat[ing] [her] in his seating arrangements" during a meeting, excluding her from "group activities and greetings with the rest of the executive team" during a holiday parade, requiring her to come into the office during her time off "for no purpose," depriving her of hazard pay, and forcing her to relocate her work area to the basement. Id. ¶¶ 181-85, 187, 190, 194, 202. With regard to defendant Williams, plaintiff Butler claims that Williams threatened to put her on "away without leave" status and then refused to give her leave for failing to provide medical documentation for her leave. Id. ¶¶ 211, 215.
These allegations, taken together, are the sort of "employer-employee conflicts" that may have caused plaintiff Butler some "[e]mbarassment and difficulty," but do not amount to the "extreme and outrageous conduct" required to sustain an IIED claim. See Best, 484 A.2d at 986; Waldon v. Covington, 415 A.2d 1070, 1078 (D.C. 1980) (finding conduct not outrageous when employer refused to give employee-professor keys to laboratory and notice of departmental meetings, threatened to begin [*37]  actions to test the plaintiff's competency with an aim to terminate her, and assigned the plaintiff classes outside her specialty knowing it would cause difficulty and embarrassment). Furthermore, while her allegations regarding the alleged mistreatment may "indicate a violation of public policy with regard to age discrimination . . . they do not rise to the level of outrageousness necessary to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress." See Hoffman v. Hill & Knowlton, Inc., 777 F. Supp. 1003, 1004-05 (D.D.C. 1991) (concluding that refusing to give an employee work responsibilities per the terms of his employment contract, moving the employee's desk to an unfavorable location, and promoting younger employees to positions for which plaintiff was qualified was not sufficiently outrageous conduct). Accordingly, plaintiff Butler's IIED claim in Count VIII will be dismissed.

B. Plaintiff Reed
In support of his IIED claim, plaintiff Reed alleges that he "was falsely accused of making threatening phone calls to Mr. Thompson and later banned from the work building." Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 280-90, 344. He also claims elsewhere in the complaint that Thompson made him walk to lunch several times a week, even though he knew that Reed's disability [*38]  made walking long distances painful, and that he ordered Reed to attend an event while on medical leave to serve as a photographer for Thompson and his wife. Id. ¶¶ 246-50, 256-57.
While plaintiff Reed has described a pattern of insensitive and inappropriate conduct, these personal disputes and "employer-employee conflicts do not, as a matter of law, rise to the level of outrageous conduct" required to sustain an IIED claim, Best, 484 A.2d at 986, even if Reed felt compelled to obey Thompson because he was the supervisor. The allegations that Thompson falsely accused Reed of threatening him and had Reed banned from the office are more serious, but they do not suffice under District of Columbia precedent, which emphasizes the sort of extreme and outrageous behavior for which this tort is reserved. For example, in Kerrigan, 705 A.2d 624, the D.C. Court of Appeals considered similarly troubling allegations and still found that the plaintiffs IIED claim failed as a matter of law:
[The plaintiff] alleges that [his employer] targeted him for a sexual harassment investigation, manufactured evidence against him in order to establish a false claim of sexual harassment, leaked information from the investigation to other employees, and [*39]  unjustifiably demoted him to the position of store manager in order to promote a woman to his position. This conduct, even construed as true, was of the type attributable to "employer-employee conflicts [that] do not, as a matter of law, rise to the level of outrageous conduct."
Id. at 628, quoting Best, 484 A.2d at 986; see also, e.g., Williams v. District of Columbia, 9 A.3d 484, 493-94 (D.C. 2010) (finding that the defendant employers' conduct was not sufficiently "extreme and outrageous" to sustain an IIED claim where the plaintiff claimed that his employers' agents spread false rumors that the employer terminated the plaintiff for embezzlement, when the plaintiff claimed that he was terminated for enforcing a park rule against the mayor's children).
For those reasons, plaintiff Reed has failed to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and defendants' motions to dismiss Count VIII in its entirety will be granted.

V. Count IX: Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress
Defendants have also moved to dismiss plaintiff Reed's claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress ("NIED") in Count IX "because there is no indication of any physical injury" or that he suffered severe emotional distress, and because he failed to allege facts sufficient to show [*40]  the sort of "special relationship" necessary to support such a claim D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 15-18; see also Williams Mem. at 7-8. The Court agrees, and it will dismiss this count in full.

A. Plaintiff Reed has failed to state a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress against defendant Thompson under the zone of physical danger rule.
Historically, courts evaluating negligent infliction of emotional distress claims "followed the 'physical impact' rule, which permits recovery for negligently inflicted emotional distress if the distress results from a physical impact and is accompanied by a physical injury." Hedgepeth v. Whitman Walker Clinic, 22 A.3d 789, 796 (D.C. 2011). But the D.C. Court of Appeals has "abandoned the 'physical impact' requirement in favor of the more liberal 'zone of physical danger' rule, which permits recovery for mental distress if the defendant's actions caused the plaintiff to be 'in danger of physical injury' and if, as a result, the plaintiff 'feared for his own safety.'" Id., quoting Williams v. Baker, 572 A.2d 1062, 1066 (D.C. 1990) (en banc).
Under this theory of liability, "[a] plaintiff who was not physically injured can recover on a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress only if he or she 'was in the zone of physical danger and was caused [*41]  by defendant's negligence to fear for his or her own safety.'" Destefano v. Children's Nat'l Med. Ctr., 121 A.3d 59, 72 (D.C. 2015). "[T]he zone of danger rule . . . requires that the plaintiffs presence in the zone of danger be contemporaneous with her fear for her own safety," Jones v. Howard Univ., Inc., 589 A.2d 419, 423 (D.C. 1991), and "the plaintiff must show that [ ]he was physically endangered by the defendant's negligent activity." Johnson v. District of Columbia, 728 A.2d 70, 77 (D.C. 1999).
In support of his NIED claim, Reed alleges that he suffered "serious emotional distress" as a result of Thompson's denial of his reasonable accommodation request and the threats accusation, and that those actions caused him to endure "an inordinate amount of pain, both physical and emotional, during the time he was on medical leave." Consolidated Compl. ¶ 350(e). He adds that he was "emotionally shook" upon learning that Thompson had "called the police on him" for making the alleged threat, and that he suffered "increased anxiety, depression, and serious emotional stress, which exacerbated his already serious physical ailments." Id. He also complains that Thompson "purposely on multiple occasions made Plaintiff Reed walk with him regardless of Plaintiff Reed's limitations," that he "feared for his job on multiple occasions," and that he felt bound to follow Thompson's [*42]  orders. Pls.' D.C. & Thompson Opp. at 19-20.
But none of these allegations supports a finding that plaintiff Reed was actually "physically endangered" by defendant Thompson's conduct in the manner contemplated by the case law. Compare Destefano, 121 A.3d at 69-70 (finding that mother "was not initially in the zone of danger" created by open vent shaft and that "she was not physically endangered by the hole in the wall" because she "could not have accidentally fallen in . . . because the top of the vent was too low in relation to her body") with District of Columbia v. Evans, 644 A.2d 1008,1018-19 (D.C. 1994) (finding that a plaintiff who was in close proximity to gunshots that killed her son was within the zone of physical danger). Nor do his allegations permit the Court to infer that he feared for his own physical safety at that time. Thus, plaintiff Reed has not pled sufficient factual allegations to bring him within the coverage of the zone of physical danger rule, although his failure to accommodate claims remain to be litigated.

B. Plaintiff Reed has failed to state a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress against defendant Thompson under the special relationship rule.
Beyond the zone of physical injury rule, a plaintiff may also state a claim for negligent [*43]  infliction of emotional distress if he makes the following showing:
(1) the defendant has a relationship with the plaintiff, or has undertaken an obligation to the plaintiff, of a nature that necessarily implicates the plaintiffs emotional well-being, (2) there is an especially likely risk that the defendant's negligence would cause serious emotional distress to the plaintiff, and (3) negligent actions or omissions of the defendant in breach of that obligation have, in fact, caused serious emotional distress to the plaintiff.
Hedgepeth, 22 A.3d at 810-11. Plaintiff Reed insists that he satisfies this test because he and defendant Thompson "were friends for years" — Reed states that they "confided in one another" and socialized together, and that Reed "supported [Thompson] and offered him friendly advice" during difficult times. Consolidated Compl. ¶ 350.
The Court is not persuaded that a friendship — even a close one — gives rise to the sort of special relationship contemplated by the case law. The D.C. Court of Appeals has emphasized that "not all relationships will give rise to a duty to avoid negligent infliction of emotional distress, as the law recognizes and imposes a duty of care on many different types of [*44]  relationships, not all of which necessarily implicate the emotional well-being of the parties." Hedgepeth, 22 A.3d at 812 n.39. While it has expressly declined "to catalog all the undertakings or relationships that give rise to a duty to avoid causing emotional distress," the Court has provided several examples: relationships between patients and mental-health caretakers and patients and physicians, which directly involve the patients' emotional well-being, and relationships involving a "hospital's false report of death" to a loved one, or "a funeral home's mishandling of a corpse," which implicate the loved ones' well-being. Id. at 812-14. The Court also mentioned appointed guardians and counsel for children, the elderly, and the disabled as caretakers whose activities have the potential to implicate emotional well-being, but it instructed that even for those types of relationships, "court[s] should weigh several factors" to determine "whether such appointments comprise a duty to care for the emotional well-being of wards and clients." Id. at 814-15.
In light of that high threshold, the D.C. Court of Appeals has observed that "many relationships . . . generally will not come within the [special relationship] rule, because neither the purpose [*45]  of the relationship nor the [defendant's] undertaking is to care for the plaintiff's emotional well-being." Id. at 815. Accordingly, "[w]hether the defendant breached [his] obligations is to be determined by reference to the specific terms of the undertaking agreed upon by the parties or, otherwise, by an objective standard of reasonableness applicable to the underlying relationship or undertaking." Id. at 811.
Based on the examples and guidance provided in Hedgepeth, the Court finds that the personal friendship between plaintiff Reed and defendant Thompson does not qualify as the sort of special relationship that is the necessary predicate for his NIED claim. There are no allegations that defendant Thompson specifically undertook to care for plaintiff Reed's well-being when he befriended him, or from which it would be objectively reasonable to conclude that Thompson owed Reed a specific duty to do so. And while the relationship between two friends may certainly be special in some sense, it is just not the sort of affirmative undertaking or dependence that necessarily implicates a party's emotional well-being in the manner contemplated by the case law. See, e.g., id. at 813 (observing that the physician-patient [*46]  relationship can support an NIED claim "[b]ecause care for the body and the emotions are so interlinked, and patients often are dependent on their physicians' exercise of due care, [and] they therefore are susceptible to suffer emotionally as well as physically as a result of their physicians' negligence"); accord Sibley v. St. Albans Sch., 134 A.3d 789, 798 (D.C. 2016) ("The relationship between a student and his school or the musical director of his choir program is not enough, without more, to impose the predicate duty of care for a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.").
If the Court were to find that every friendship gave rise to a special relationship for NIED purposes, any person slighted by a personal insult or being left off an invitation list could bring a tort claim the District of Columbia. The purpose of the NIED claim and the case law simply do not support such a cause of action. For those reasons, plaintiff Reed's NIED claim against defendant Thompson will be dismissed.

C. Plaintiff Reed has failed to state a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress against defendant Williams under any theory of liability.
Defendant Williams has also moved to dismiss plaintiff Reed's NIED claim against her, Williams [*47]  Mem. at 7-8, and plaintiffs state that they "consent to the dismissal of the NIED claim as it relates to Ms. Williams," provided that it is without prejudice. Pls.' Williams Opp. at 1. But even without plaintiffs' consent to the dismissal, this count would fail. Plaintiff Reed's claims regarding Williams's allegedly negligent conduct are even more sparse than those concerning defendant Thompson, and he has failed to state a claim against her under any theory of liability.
In the section of the complaint devoted to this count, plaintiff Reed offers no specific factual allegations about how defendant Williams caused him to suffer emotional distress. See Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 349-51. Elsewhere in the complaint, he alleges only that Thompson and Williams conspired "to build a false performance-based set of excuses to demote or fire" him, and that they falsely claimed that he was "insubordinate and unresponsive to communications." Id. ¶ 243. Nowhere does he offer any factual allegation that would support a finding that he was placed in contemporaneous, physical danger by defendant Williams, or that he was in the sort of special relationship with her that would permit him to bring an NIED [*48]  claim. Accordingly, Count IX will be dismissed in full.

VI. Count X: First Amendment
In Count X, plaintiffs Teasdell, Moreno, Meyers, Butler, and Reed allege that defendants violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of expression when Thompson and Williams retaliated against them for speaking out against defendants' "illegal practices." Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 356-58. Defendants have moved to dismiss this count in its entirety, arguing that "none of the Plaintiffs spoke as private citizens on a matter of public concern," as required to state a First Amendment claim, because their speech was about "their official duties, or concerns related directly to their employment." D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 19-22; Williams Mem. at 9-12.
"The speech of public employees enjoys considerable, but not unlimited, First Amendment protection." Wilburn v. Robinson, 480 F.3d 1140, 1149, 375 U.S. App. D.C. 257 (D.C. Cir. 2007), citing O'Donnell v. Barry, 148 F.3d 1126, 1133, 331 U.S. App. D.C. 272 (D.C. Cir. 1998). A public employee seeking to state a claim for retaliation in violation of the First Amendment must satisfy a four-factor test:
First, the public employee must have spoken as a citizen on a matter of public concern. Second, the court must consider whether the governmental interest in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees . . . outweighs the employee's interest, as a citizen, in commenting [*49]  upon matters of public concern. Third, the employee must show that her speech was a substantial or motivating factor in prompting the retaliatory or punitive act. Finally, the employee must refute the government employer's showing, if made, that it would have reached the same decision in the absence of the protected speech.
Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Court has emphasized that "[t]he first two factors . . . are questions of law for the court to resolve, while the latter are questions of fact ordinarily for the jury." Id., quoting Tao v. Freeh, 27 F.3d 635, 639, 307 U.S. App. D.C. 185 (D.C. Cir. 1994). At issue here is whether plaintiffs were speaking as "citizens" or as employees, and whether they were speaking "on a matter of public concern." See D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 19.
To state a claim of retaliation under the First Amendment, the public employee first must show that he was speaking as a public citizen, and not just as an employee, because "the First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee's expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities." Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 411, 126 S. Ct. 1951, 164 L. Ed. 2d 689 (2006). "Ordinarily, employees who make recommendations to their supervisors on subjects directly related to their jobs are carrying out their official duties and thus receive no [*50]  First Amendment protection. . . . even if the supervisors discourage this speech." Thompson v. District of Columbia, 530 F.3d 914, 916-17, 382 U.S. App. D.C. 1 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Moreover, speech made in the context of an "attempt to implement" official responsibilities, including "reporting conduct that interfere[s] with . . . job responsibilities" is unprotected. Mpoy v. Rhee, 758 F.3d 285, 291, 411 U.S. App. D.C. 94 (D.C. Cir. 2014).
"To determine whether speech 'was made pursuant to official responsibilities, the Court must take a hard look at the context of the speech,'" id. at 292, quoting Decotiis v. Whittemore, 635 F.3d 22, 32 (1st Cir. 2011), including the employee's job description, Thompson, 530 F.3d at 916, or the employee's testimony regarding his job responsibilities, Winder v. Erste, 566 F.3d 209, 215, 386 U.S. App. D.C. 26 (D.C. Cir. 2009), and whether the employee invoked his title and company resources to make the speech. Bowie v. Maddox, 642 F.3d 1122, 1134, 395 U.S. App. D.C. 301 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (holding that employee was not speaking as a "citizen" when the contested speech identified his job title, was undertaken at the direction of his employer, and drafted by employer's legal counsel).
Second, to qualify for First Amendment protection, a public employee's speech must address "a matter of public concern." Wilburn, 480 F.3d at 1149. This determination is based on a consideration of the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record. Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146, 103 S. Ct. 1684, 75 L. Ed. 2d 708 (1983). Matters of public concern, as opposed to "matters only of personal interest," are those matters that are "of political, social, or other concern to [*51]  the community " Id. at 146-47. The D.C. Circuit has further explained:
Speech by public employees may be characterized as not of "public concern" when it is clear that such speech deals with individual personnel disputes and grievances and that the information would be of no relevance to the public's evaluation of the performance of governmental agencies. On the other hand, speech that concerns "issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable members of society" to make informed decisions about the operation of their government merits the highest degree of first amendment protection.
LeFande v. District of Columbia, 613 F.3d 1155, 1159, 392 U.S. App. D.C. 188 (D.C. Cir. 2010), quoting McKinley v. City of Eloy, 705 F.2d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir. 1983). "In other words, the role of the whistle-blower merits protection; the expressions of personal dissatisfaction by a discontented employee do not." Murray v. Gardner, 741 F.2d 434, 438, 239 U.S. App. D.C. 212 (D.C. Cir. 1984).

A. Plaintiff Teasdell
In support of her First Amendment claim, plaintiff Teasdell states that she "informed Ms. Williams and Dr. Thompson that the Agency's practice of having persons work outside of their job descriptions and allowing persons funded by federal grants to work outside of the scope of their grant was illegal." Consolidated Compl. ¶ 356; see also Pls.' D.C. & Thompson Opp. at 23.
Teasdell served as the Associate Director of the agency's Aging and Disability Resource [*52]  Center. Consolidated Compl. ¶ 40. The Court does not have the benefit of her job description or her testimony regarding her job responsibilities that would enable it to "take a hard look at the context of [her] speech." Mpoy, 758 F.3d at 292. But especially in light of the fact that Teasdell states that she "was made the point of contact between the Office on Aging and various other entities including the Department of Homeland Security," Consolidated Compl. ¶ 41, it is reasonable to infer that ensuring that employees were properly assigned work within their job and federal grant descriptions was part of her official duties as Associate Director, and that her complaint to her supervisors on this topic was "directly related to [her] job." See Thompson, 530 F.3d at 916; Mpoy, 758 F.3d at 291. Teasdell has put forth no factual allegations that would support any other conclusion. So whether or not she was addressing a matter of public concern when she informed defendants that work was being illegally assigned, Teasdell has failed to plausibly allege any facts that would enable the Court to find that she was speaking as a public citizen, and so her First Amendment claim fails.

B. Plaintiff Meyers
Meyers states that she engaged in protected speech when she "advised Dr. [*53]  Thompson and Ms. Williams that the agency was in violation of federal overtime laws and regulation." Consolidated Compl. ¶ 356; see also Pls.' D.C. & Thompson Opp. at 23.
Meyers was employed as an Administrative Officer within the agency's General Services Division, and she states that her "job responsibilities" included "managing HR [Human Resources] for the Agency." Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 106-07. Certainly, ensuring that the agency was in compliance with federal overtime laws and regulations would fall within the official duties and responsibilities of the individual charged with managing human resources, and Meyers' complaint to her supervisors on that topic is therefore not protected speech. See, e.g., Wilburn, 480 F.3d at 1150-51 (holding that an employee who complained to her employer's personnel office about discrimination in salary decisions was speaking pursuant to her employment responsibilities as Interim Director of the Office of Human Rights, which included exposing discriminatory practices in salary and hiring matters). So plaintiff Meyers's First Amendment claim will be dismissed because she was acting in her capacity as an employee, not as a public citizen.

C. Plaintiff Moreno
In support of his First Amendment claim, plaintiff [*54]  Moreno alleges that he "raised issues of the Agency and Ms. Williams willfully violating Federal and DC age discrimination laws by specifically targeting older employees." Consolidated Compl. ¶ 356; Pls.' D.C. & Thompson Opp. at 23.
Moreno was employed as a "Strategic Planner," and in that position, he "created and developed the Agency's strategic plan and was given the opportunity to work on special projects and programs with the Executive Director," defendant Thompson. Consolidated Compl. ¶ 57. His "role also included fostering new and supporting existing partnerships with other organizations and companies in an effort to support the missions and goals of the Agency." Id. ¶ 59. In June 2013, he was promoted to "Manger of External Affairs and Communication." Id. ¶ 74.
Unlike plaintiffs Teasdell and Meyers, it is not immediately clear from plaintiff Moreno's title or the factual allegations concerning his responsibilities that his speech bore any connection to his role as Manager of External Affairs. So at this stage, and granting him the reasonable inferences to which he is entitled, the Court finds that it would be premature to dismiss plaintiff Moreno's First Amendment claim on the grounds that [*55]  his speech necessarily was made as an employee, and not as a public citizen.
Furthermore, the Court finds that it is plausible that speaking out about the fact that the Office on Aging was discriminating against its older employees qualifies as speech on a matter of public concern. The D.C. Circuit has instructed that "[a] statement concerning racial discrimination on the part of a public agency is a matter of public concern because it involves information that enables 'members of society to make informed decisions about the operation of their government.'" Tao, 27 F.3d at 640, quoting McKinley, 705 F.2d at 1114. And while it is true as a general matter that "an individual personnel dispute does not generally constitute a matter of public concern, an employee's speech aimed at resolving a personnel dispute may [nevertheless] touch upon an issue of public concern." Id. at 639-40 (internal citations omitted).
In the Tao case, the D.C. Circuit considered whether the plaintiff was speaking on a matter of public concern when she wrote a letter claiming that her employer was systematically discriminating against Chinese-American language specialists in its hiring and promotion practices. Id. at 640. The Court determined that the letter was "broader than an [*56]  individual employee personnel grievance" because it alleged that the discrimination was "occurring against all Chinese-Americans in [the plaintiff's] unit" and it specifically characterized the plaintiff's administrative appeal as a "protest" against that discrimination. Id. "While the letter may have been instigated by an individual personnel dispute," the Court found that "its content reache[d] beyond that dispute to a broader issue — racial discrimination in a public agency," and it reversed the district court's award of summary judgment to the agency on that issue. Id. at 640-41.
Here, plaintiff Moreno's complaint that the agency and defendant Williams were "willfully violating Federal and DC age discrimination laws by specifically targeting older employees" for demotions and terminations, see Consolidated Compl. ¶ 356, is "broader than an individual employee personnel grievance" because it alleges discrimination against an entire class of employees, and it touches upon "discrimination on the part of a public agency," which qualifies as a matter of public concern. See Tao, 27 F.3d at 640. Accordingly, the Court finds that he has plausibly alleged sufficient facts to support his First Amendment claim.
Finally, the Court notes [*57]  that the fact that plaintiff Moreno's complaints about age discrimination were made internally, and "not made public does not affect the analysis." Id. at 640. "The freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not 'lost to the public employee who arranges to communicate privately with his [or her] employer rather than to spread his [or her] views before the public.'" Id. at 640-41, quoting Givhan v. W. Line Consol. School Dist., 439 U.S. 410,415-16, 99 S. Ct. 693, 58 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1979).
For those reasons, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff Moreno's First Amendment claim in Count X will be denied.

D. Plaintiffs Butler & Reed
Plaintiffs Butler and Reed state that their First Amendment claim is based on the fact that they "attended a mediation in which Dr. Thompson and Ms. Williams were amongst other things accused of creating a hostile work environment." Consolidated Compl. ¶ 356; see also Pls.' D.C. & Thompson Opp. at 23. There is no allegation that plaintiffs Butler and Reed engaged in any speech at all at that meeting, let alone that they did so as citizens and on a matter of public concern. The sole allegation concerning the meeting describes it as an airing of workplace concerns, which is the sort of "expression[ ] of personal dissatisfaction by a discontented employee" that is not entitled to constitutional protection. See Murray, 741 F.2d at 438. So [*58]  the First Amendment claims brought by plaintiffs Butler and Reed in Count X will be dismissed.

VII. Punitive Damages
Plaintiffs seek "[p]unitive damages as will be proven at trial against each of the Defendants." Consolidated Compl., Prayer for Relief ¶ 11. The District argues that plaintiffs cannot recover punitive damages against it because such damages may not be awarded against a municipality without express statutory authorization or the presence of extraordinary circumstances. D.C. & Thompson Mem. at 22-23; see also Defs.' Reply to Pls.' D.C. & Thompson Opp. [Dkt. # 34] at 16-17. Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute that "as a general rule there can be no recovery of punitive damages against a municipality absent a statute expressly authorizing it," Smith v. District of Columbia, 336 A.2d 831, 832 (D.C. 1975), but they insist that punitive damages are nevertheless available against the District because this case involves the sort of "extraordinary circumstances" that courts have previously held provide a basis for such a claim. Pls.' D.C. & Thompson Opp. at 26-27.
"The term 'extraordinary circumstances' is a term of art in this context." Butera v. District of Columbia, 235 F.3d 637,658 (D.C. Cir. 2001). The D.C. Circuit has "clarified the meaning of 'extraordinary circumstances' to refer to circumstances such as 'where [*59]  a jurisdiction's taxpayers are directly responsible for perpetrating the policies that caused the plaintiffs injuries" or "where a municipality or its policymakers have intentionally adopted the unconstitutional policy that caused the damages in question." Id., quoting Daskalea v. District of Columbia, 227 F.3d 433, 447, 343 U.S. App. D.C. 261 (D.C. Cir. 2000).
While the first extraordinary circumstance is not present here, plaintiffs have pled enough facts for the Court to conclude that dismissal of their punitive damages claim against the District, based on the individual defendants' alleged unconstitutional and discriminatory conduct, would be premature at this time. Defendant Thompson was the Executive Director of the Office on Aging and defendant Williams served as Chief of Staff, Consolidated Compl. ¶¶ 20-21, and plaintiffs allege that those defendants intentionally adopted a policy of discriminating against older employees and retaliating against those who opposed the misconduct, in violation of statutory requirements and the First Amendment. See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 23-27, 32-33, 65-67, 131, 134, 298-302, 319-30, 338-42, 352-60. The evidence may not ultimately rise to the requisite level, but if proved, these facts may constitute the kind of "extraordinary circumstances" that could support [*60]  the awarding of punitive damages against the District. Without the full factual record, the Court will decline to dismiss this claim at this stage. See, e.g., Musgrove v. Gov't of D.C., 602 F. Supp. 2d 141, 146 (D.D.C. 2009) (finding that the plaintiffs claims that "there is a culture of gender discrimination against female high school principals in the District of Columbia," "[i]f true, . . . present circumstances upon which a jury might find that 'extraordinary circumstances' could warrant the awarding of punitive damages" and concluding that "[t]his issue is not ripe for a motion to dismiss").

VIII. D.C. Code § 12-309
Finally, in its partial motion for summary judgment, the District argues that plaintiffs' DCHRA claims in Counts W and VII must be dismissed because plaintiffs failed to comply with the notice requirement imposed by D.C. Code § 12-309. Summ. J. Mem. at 3-4.
Until recently, D.C. Code § 12-309(a) provided:
An action may not be maintained against the District of Columbia for unliquidated damages to person or property unless, within six months after the injury or damage was sustained, the claimant, his agent, or attorney has given notice in writing to the Mayor of the District of Columbia of the approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances of the injury or damage. A report in writing by [*61]  the Metropolitan Police Department, in regular course of duty, is a sufficient notice under this section.
D.C. Code § 12-309 (2014). But on May 2, 2015, that provision was amended to include the following caveat: "This section shall not apply to claims brought under § 2-1403.16 or § 1-615.54." D.C. Code § 12-309(b) (2016). The amended language was enacted specifically "to clarify that the section 12-309 notice requirement does not apply to Human Rights Act claims." Human Rights Amendment Act of 2014, 2014 District of Columbia Laws 20-266 (Act 20-605).
In light of the amendment, the District "concedes that [plaintiff Meyers] was not required to give the Mayor notice" of her DCHRA claim, and the same is true for plaintiff Butler, insofar as her claims accrued after May 2, 2015. D.C.'s Reply to Pls.' Opp. to Summ. J. Mot. [Dkt. # 37] at 2-3. But it insists that plaintiff Butler's claims "for injuries occurring in August 2014, or before," must be dismissed for failure to comply with the version of section 12-309 in effect at that time, and that plaintiff Moreno's DCHRA claim must be dismissed in its entirety because all of his claims accrued — and notice to the District was required — before the amendment took effect. Id. at 2.
Plaintiffs do not contest that they failed to notify the District of their claims prior to filing suit. But they argue that [*62]  the amendment "explicitly clarified that the notice requirement [in] § 12-309 never barred claims under the Human Rights Act," and that "any previous interpretation of § 12-309 that applied the notice requirement to cases brought under the Human Rights Act was incorrect." Pls.' Surreply to Summ. J. Mot. [Dkt. # 39] at 2-3. Plaintiffs also insist that the D.C. Council "chose to, by statute, waive its right to rely" on section 12-309 as "a defense of sovereign immunity" through the amendment, and that "this waiver cannot be taken back." Id. at 4.
But until the 2015 amendment, the law in the District of Columbia was clear: the section 12-309 notice requirement applied to all statutory claims, including DCHRA claims. See, e.g., Owens v. District of Columbia, 993 A.2d 1085, 1087-88 (D.C. 2010). And while the amendment may have clarified that the notice provision "shall not apply to claims brought" under the DCHRA from the date of its passage onward, see D.C. Code § 12-309(b) (2016), it said nothing about how the amendment would affect claims brought before that date. Because "[t]here is a 'well-settled presumption' against giving statutes retroactive effect," Davis v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 610 F.3d 750, 753, 391 U.S. App. D.C. 365 (D.C. Cir. 2010), quoting Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 277, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994), and there is no evidence that the D.C. Council intended for the amendment to apply retroactively, plaintiffs' argument is unavailing.
Accordingly, to the extent [*63]  that plaintiffs seek unliquidated damages as part of their DCHRA claims in Counts W and VII, those claims that accrued prior to May 2, 2015 were subject to the section 12-309 notice requirement. Because plaintiffs failed to comply with that notice requirement for those claims, defendant is entitled to judgment in its favor.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, it is
ORDERED that the District's and defendant Thompson's Partial Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. # 26], defendant Williams's Partial Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. # 31], and the District's Partial Motion for Summary Judgment are hereby GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Counts I, III, V, VI and the ADEA retaliation claim in Count VII will proceed in full. The FLSA claims brought by plaintiffs Jones and Reed in Count II will proceed and the claims brought by plaintiffs Teasdell and Meyers are dismissed. The DCHRA claims brought in Counts IV and VII will proceed for all plaintiffs, except for those claims seeking unliquidated damages that accrued prior to May 2, 2015, which are dismissed. The claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress in Counts VIII and IX are dismissed in their entirety. The First Amendment claims in Count X are dismissed, [*64]  with the exception of the claim brought by plaintiff Moreno, which will proceed. And finally, plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages against the District will go forward at this time.
SO ORDERED.
