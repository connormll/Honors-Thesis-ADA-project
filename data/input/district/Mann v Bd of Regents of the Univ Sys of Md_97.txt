Opinion



MEMORANDUM OPINION
Plaintiff Erica Mann ("Mann") brings this action against Defendants alleging violations of various federal civil rights laws related to her time as a student at the University of Maryland. Currently pending before the Court is Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 9).1 The Court has reviewed the entire record, as well as the pleadings and exhibits, with respect to the instant motion. The issues have been briefed, and no hearing is deemed [*2]  necessary. See Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2008). For the reasons stated more fully below, the Court will grant Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss.

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
The following facts are taken from the complaint and all inferences are drawn in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Mann has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities, and rote memory challenges. Beginning in the spring of 2002, Mann attended the University of Maryland and participated in the Academic Achievement Program ("AAP"). The AAP accepts students with disabilities and students from populations historically underrepresented at the University. Mann intended to earn a degree in kinesiology.
Before her classes began, Mann took her most recent neuropsychological evaluation and her high school individualized education program ("IEP") to the director of the University's Disability Support Services ("DSS"). Mann provided this information so that DSS could arrange for the provision of reasonable accommodations to assist Mann in her classes. DSS refused to provide any accommodations because Mann's neurological evaluation was out of date. To address this concern, Manny sought an updated neurological [*3]  evaluation from Dr. Adele Green in November 2002. Dr. Green recommended that Mann receive the following accommodations: (1) priority class registration; (2) un-timed tests; (3) the option of a reader; scribe, or laptop for in-class tests; (4) use of a calculator and formula card for tests; (5) priority or quiet seating for tests; (6) use of a note-taker, note-taking service, tape recorder, and laptop in class; (7) access to advance organizers or outlines of upcoming materials; and (8) the use of taped textbooks. Although Mann provided DSS with a copy of Dr. Green's neurological evaluation, Defendants decided not to provide Mann with any accommodations. As a result, Mann's grades suffered throughout 2002 and 2003. In the spring of 2003, the University dismissed Mann due to her academic performance.
Following a semester at Montgomery College (where Mann received some accommodations) the University readmitted Mann in the spring of 2004. At that time, the University again refused to provide the accommodations recommended by Dr. Green, as the University claimed it had lost Dr. Green's neurological evaluation. However, the University did begin providing Mann with some accommodations, which [*4]  had been recommended by Mann's original neurological evaluation and IEP. These accommodations consisted of: (1) extended time for test taking; (2) the services of a note-taker; and (3) use of a calculator during tests. Although the University instructed her professors to provide these accommodations, Mann rarely received them. Nonetheless, Mann's academic performance improved dramatically in the spring of 2004.
In the fall of 2004, Mann enrolled in an anatomy course, which was required to earn a kinesiology degree. For the first half of this class, Mann did not receive the accommodations allowed by the University, which were still based on the original neurological evaluation and IEP. After her professor, Dr. Opaku, learned that Mann was supposed to receive accommodations, she began providing them to Mann. Mann and Dr. Opaku then met with DSS, and Mann again requested the accommodations recommended by Dr. Green. These accommodations were not provided by the University. Dr. Opaku ultimately gave Mann an incomplete for the course as she did not feel it was fair to grade Mann given that she received accommodations for only half of the semester. Mann planned to retake the class in the summer [*5]  of 2005.
On January 21, 2005, Mann requested an override so that she could enroll in a class that had full enrollment. Dr. Elizabeth Brown, a guidance counselor, declined Mann's request and told Mann that the University did not want Mann to graduate with a kinesiology degree because of her rote memory problem. Dr. Brown then withdrew Mann from her kinesiology classes and enrolled her in the family studies program.
On January 25, 2005, Mann and her mother met with Dr. Philips, the head of the kinesiology department. Philips reiterated that the University did not want Mann to graduate with a kinesiology degree because of her memory impairment.
On January 27, 2005, Mann met with Dr. Robert Waters, the University's Provost. Dr. Waters told Mann that the University would not allow her to pursue a kinesiology degree. Dr. Waters also told Mann that he would withdraw her from her anatomy course. However, at the end of the spring of 2005 semester, Plaintiff's anatomy grade was changed from an incomplete to F, rather than withdrawn.
From the spring of 2005 forward, Plaintiff continued to struggle at the University. Despite numerous attempts, Mann was unable to convince the University to readmit [*6]  her to the kinesiology program or to change her anatomy grade from F to withdrawn. Nonetheless, Mann ultimately earned a degree in family studies in the spring of 2006.
Mann took the Law School Admissions Test ("LSAT") in January 2006. DSS refused to sign forms that would allow Mann to have accommodations while taking the LSAT.
Mann filed a four-count complaint on March 13, 2008.2 In Count III of the complaint, Mann alleges that Defendants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and the Rehabilitation Act by failing to provide her with reasonable accommodations. On June 13, 2008, Defendants filed the present motion. Based on the statute of limitations, Defendants seek dismissal of Count III of the complaint.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
The purpose of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is to test the sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint. See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir. 1999). Except in certain specified cases, a plaintiff's complaint need only satisfy the "simplified pleading standard" of Rule 8(a), Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 513, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002), which requires a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Nevertheless, "Rule 8(a)(2) still requires a 'showing,' rather than a blanket assertion, of entitlement to relief." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 n.3, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). That showing [*7]  must consist of at least "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. at 1974.
In its determination, the Court must consider all well-pled allegations in a complaint as true, Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 268, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1994), and must construe all factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Harrison v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 176 F.3d 776, 783 (4th Cir. 1999). The court need not, however, accept unsupported legal allegations, Revene v. Charles County Comm'rs, 882 F.2d 870, 873 (4th Cir. 1989), legal conclusions couched as factual allegations, Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986), or conclusory factual allegations devoid of any reference to actual events, United Black Firefighters v. Hirst, 604 F.2d 844, 847 (4th Cir. 1979). In sum, "[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)." Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965 (internal citations omitted).

III. ANALYSIS
A statute of limitations represents "a pervasive legislative judgment that it is unjust to fail to put the adversary on notice to defend within a specified period of time and that 'the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.'" United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 117, 100 S. Ct. 352, 62 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1979).
Under Maryland law, a three year statute of limitations applies to claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. See Schalk v. Associated Anesthesiology Practice, 316 F. Supp. 2d 244, 251 (D. Md. 2004); Kohler v. Shenasky, 914 F. Supp. 1206, 1211 (D. Md. 1995). Pursuant to a tolling agreement between the parties, Mann's complaint [*8]  is treated as if it were filed on January 17, 2008. Accordingly, the statute of limitations prevents recovery for conduct that occurred before January 17, 2005.
Defendants argue that Count III should be dismissed because the conduct that formed the basis for Count III occurred prior to January 17, 2005 and, therefore, Count III is barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiff argues that Defendants denied her accommodations before and after January 17, 2005. Plaintiff asserts that conduct that occurred before January 17, 2005 can be considered by the Court under the continuous violation doctrine. Defendants counter that the continuous violation doctrine does not apply to this case and that Count III is not supported by Plaintiff's allegations regarding conduct that occurred after January 17, 2005.
The Supreme Court has discussed the continuous violations doctrine at length in the context of Title VII employment cases. See Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 127 S. Ct. 2162, 167 L. Ed. 2d 982 (2007);3 Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). The Court has held that the continuous violations doctrine does not apply to causes of action based on discrete acts. See Morgan, 536 U.S. at 114-15. Discrete acts are defined as actions that can be said to occur on a particular day and are separately actionable. See id. The Court explained [*9]  that the continuous violation doctrine applies to cases where the alleged wrong "cannot be said to occur on any particular day. It occurs over a series of days or perhaps years and, in direct contrast to discrete acts . . . may not be actionable on its own." Id. at 115. For example, hostile work environment claims and certain claims under the Fair Housing Act can be considered continuous violations. See id.; Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 378-79, 102 S. Ct. 1114, 71 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1982). Courts have also distinguished continuous violations from continuous effects. See, e.g., Moseke v. Miller & Smith, Inc., 202 F. Supp. 2d 492, 506 (E.D. Va. 2002) ("[T]he Supreme Court has consistently held that a continuous violation was not present where there was a subsequent effect resulting from the defendant's prior discriminatory act"). Where a discrete act occurs outside of the statute of limitations but the effects of that discrete act continue into a time within the statute of limitations, the continuing violations doctrine is not applicable. Id. at 506-9.
Although Morgan was a Title VII case, courts have applied its logic to determine the applicability of the continuous violations doctrine in cases where a disabled plaintiffs' requests for reasonable accommodations under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act have been denied. See, e.g., Tobin v, Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 553 F.3d 121, 130-31 (1st Cir. 2009); Long v. Howard Univ., 512 F. Supp. 2d 1, 16 (D.D.C. 2007) ("[T]here is no principled basis for declining to apply Morgan to denials of requests for reasonable accommodations under the Rehabilitation Act or ADA"). While the Fourth Circuit has not published an opinion directly on point, it has issued an unpublished opinion that indicates it would apply Morgan to a denial of reasonable accommodations case. See Szedlock v. Tenet, 61 Fed. Appx. 88, 93 (4th Cir. 2003). The Court agrees that Morgan is applicable to this case.
Prior to January 17, 2005, Mann requested and was denied accommodations on at least four occasions (twice in 2002 and twice in 2004). Mann could have filed and maintained a lawsuit based on each individual [*11]  denial. As such, each denial was a discrete act. As stated in Tobin, "the denial of a disabled employee's request for accommodation starts the clock running on the day it occurs. As we have noted, such a denial is a discrete discriminatory act that . . . does not require repeated conduct to establish an actionable claim. Consequently, the continuing violation doctrine does not apply to this case." Tobin, 553 F.3d at 130-31. See also Szedlock, 61 Fed. Appx. at 93; Long, 512 F. Supp. 2d at 17. The Court finds that the continuous violation doctrine does not apply to Count III and, accordingly, any denial of accommodations to Mann prior to January 17, 2005 is barred by the statute of limitations.
The Court next must determine whether Plaintiff has alleged any conduct that occurred after January 17, 2005 that can support Count III. Mann argues that the she was denied reasonable accommodations by: (1) being forced out of the kinesiology department at meetings held between January 21-27, 2005; (2) being denied Dr. Opaku's offer to allow her to retake her anatomy class; (3) the University's failure to sign her LSAT accommodations form; and (4) the University's refusal to provide accommodations during the fall of 2005. As discussed below, the Court does not believe that [*12]  any of these allegations support Count III.
Mann's first argument is not a denial of accommodations. Rather, this argument relates to Mann's discrimination claim. The record does not support a finding that Mann's second argument is a denial of accommodations. By removing Mann from the kinesiology program, the University did not deny Mann any accommodations. Mann was free to retake the anatomy class and thereby gain the benefit of Dr. Opaku's offer. At the urging of the University, Mann chose not to retake the class. The fact that Mann made this decision at the suggestion of the University does not mean the University denied her any accommodations. Mann's third argument appears to based on a request for accommodations from the people who administered the LSAT exam, not from the University. Mann apparently only requested the University to sign a letter that showed that she was entitled to receive accommodations. It is not clear to the Court that the University had any obligation to sign the letter. It is even less clear how the refusal to sign the letter denied Mann any accommodations, as it appears that Mann's letter was signed by her doctor. By having her doctor sign the letter, Mann [*13]  presumably received the same accommodations on her LSAT exam that she would have received had the University signed the letter. In other words, it does not appear that Mann was denied any accommodations on the exam. Finally, Mann's fourth argument relates to the continuing effects of the prior decisions not to provide her accommodations. The continuing effects of a prior decision are not separately actionable. See Moseke, 202 F. Supp. 2d at 506.
The Court finds that Mann has not plead sufficient facts that support a cause of action based on the denial of reasonable accommodations after January 17, 2005. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants' motion and dismisses Count III. To the extent that Plaintiff believes that she can allege specific post-January 2005 acts to support a cause of action on the basis of denial of reasonable accommodations, she can file a motion to amend Count III within 10 days of the Order dismissing Count III.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss. A separate Order will follow.
