OPINION & ORDER
RAMOS, D.J.:
Anthony Girand, proceeding pro se, brings this action against his former employer, LiveTiles Corp., and two of its employees, Karl Redenbach and Peter Nguyen- Brown. The Amended Complaint includes claims for: (1) failure to provide reasonable accommodation and wrongful termination under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"); (2) retaliation under the ADA; (3) wrongful termination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"); (4) discrimination and retaliation on the basis of age, national origin, and disability under the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"), (5) discrimination and retaliation on the basis of age, national origin, and disability under the New York City Human Rights Law ("NYCHRL"); (6) common law fraud; (7) breach of contract; and (8) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (See Amended Complaint ("Am. Compl.") at Dkt. No. 1-3).
Defendants removed [*2]  this action to federal court on November 17, 2017 (see Dkt. No. 1), and, now, after discovery has concluded, move for summary judgment.
For the forgoing reasons, Defendants' motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Girand, a 51-year-old American, was hired as an Innovation Executive at LiveTiles, a New York-based technology company, on February 15, 2017, and was terminated only three months later, on May 8, 2017. (See Defendants' Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.1 Statement of Material Facts ("Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement") ¶¶ 1-3; Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.1 Statement of Material Facts ("Pltf. Rule 56.1 Statement") ¶¶ 1-3.) At the time he was hired, LiveTiles management was aware of his age and nationality. (Id. ¶ 2.) In May 2017, when Girand was terminated, LiveTiles employed 44 people, of which 32 were American. (Id. ¶ 161.) In his deposition, Girand testified with respect to LiveTiles that:
[T]he CEO is Australian, the COO is Australian. The colleague I worked with was Australian. The CFO is Australian. The new guy they hired is Australian. You know, I felt like I was suddenly working from New York for, you know, the Australian Trump family . . . But it always felt kind of - just odd being there as part [*3]  of - being an American [sic] New York office but working in Australia, basically."
(See Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 157 (citing Affirmation of Todd Parker ("Parker Aff.") Ex. 1 at 119:24-120:8.)
Plaintiff was employed pursuant to an employment agreement that provided that Girand would be compensated with a base salary and a bonus, subject to meeting a sales quota. (Id. ¶ 3.) The employment agreement provided that Girand could be terminated with or without cause, with the exception of unlawful or discriminatory reasons, upon two-weeks-notice. (Id. ¶ 6) The agreement stated that two-weeks-notice need not be given if the termination was for "non-performance or serious misconduct." (Id. ¶ 7.)1 The contract also included a warranty that Girand had "disclosed to LiveTiles any injuries and/or illnesses previously suffered that may affect your ability to effectively carry out your duties and responsibilities within your employment." (See Parker Aff. Ex. 2.) The contract warned that "[f]ailure by you to disclose any relevant factual information may result in termination of your employment summarily and/or you not being covered by workers' compensation insurance in certain instances." (Id.)

A. Girand's Conflicts with Colleagues and Clients
Starting in mid-March 2017, a little over a month after Girand was hired, employees at LiveTiles began identifying what they described as negative aspects of his performance with respect to his treatment of colleagues and clients. They provided some of this information to Redenbach and Nguyen-Brown, who made the decision to ultimately terminate Girand. (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 140; Pltf. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 140)
On March 14, 2017, Daniel Goss, VP of Innovation and Experience, sent Redenbach an email recounting a meeting between LiveTiles employees, including Girand, and representatives of one of LiveTiles's clients, HBO. (Id. at ¶ 17-18.) According to Goss, HBO said that "they would prefer not to deal with Anthony again" and that "HBO did not appreciate Anthony's behavior. The most senior guy in the meeting asked Anthony to stop talking as he wasn't listening to what HBO were [sic] saying . . . This has happened a few times lately." (Id. ¶¶ 18, 20; Parker Aff. Ex. 7.)
Five days later, on March 19, 2018, Goss sent another email to Redenbach, Nguyen-Brown, and Matt Brown, another LiveTiles Executive, forwarding an exchange between Girand and [*5]  a colleague. (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 27; Pltf. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 27; Parker Aff. Ex. 10.) The email stated that the colleague "was pretty pissed at Anthony, he thinks he is a bullshit artist who fails to listen." (Id.)
On April 3, 2017, Goss forwarded to Redenbach another email exchange between Girand and a partner, with a note that Girand's email "lack[ed] a little in 'bedside manner'" and noting that the partner had "gone quiet" since Girand's email. (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 28-31; Pltf. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 28-31; Parker Aff. Ex. 12.)
In mid-April 2017, Nguyen-Brown met with Mahdi Hamdi, who worked closely with Girand, and who, according to Hamdi, described ways in which he believed Girand had acted in a bullying or intimidating manner in his dealings with him and others. (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 133-35; Pltf. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 133-35.) Hamdi told Nguyen-Brown that he was considering leaving the company because of this behavior. (See id.) According to Hamdi, Girand would dominate meetings, "speak to [Hamdi] and other colleagues in a rude, belittling, and authoritarian way," "snap his fingers" at Hamdi, bad-mouth colleagues, and "would rudely talk over" clients and "not listen to what the client had to say or [*6]  to the question about product the client had." (See id.; Affidavit of Mahdi Hamdi ("Hamdi Aff.) ¶¶ 9-22.)
Redenbach testified that he, himself, witnessed Girand "us[ing] aggressive gestures" and "clicking [his] fingers" to get colleagues to stop talking. (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 34-35.)
Girand also acknowledged tension with some colleagues, stating in an email that he "need[ed] a reset" with some colleagues, and testifying that he wanted a "reboot," especially with Goss, with whom he could sense "tension." (Id. at 33; Parker Aff. Ex. 13; Parker Ex. 1 at 151:17-23.)

B. Girand's Cancer and Request for an Accommodation
On April 13, 2017, Girand emailed Redenbach and Nguyen-Brown disclosing that he had previously been diagnosed with cancer. (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 65-69; Pltf. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 65-69.) The email stated that he had been diagnosed with Non- Hodgkin's Lymphoma less than a year prior, and that he had undergone radiation treatment during the first nine weeks of his employment at LiveTiles. (Parker Aff. Ex. 16.) The email explained that his "focus and productivity may have lagged at times during the first several weeks" of his employment, but that his "focus [was] radically better now" and he was "feeling [*7]  himself again." (Id.) Nonetheless, Girand stated that he would "like to discuss with [Redenbach and Nguyen-Brown] a modified schedule and some way to work from home when not meeting with customers as well as a way to keep this quiet from the rest of the company." (Id.) Girand stated his desire to continue to work full time. (Id.) He also reiterated his request to "take a day or two a week to work from home" and requested "a dedicated sales assistant to help [him] manage the workflow, meetings, reports, account opening and other administrative tasks that come with the role." (Id.) The email concluded with a request to discuss the matter in person in two weeks. (Id.)
Nguyen-Brown responded that he would be "[h]appy to work out a schedule that works best for everyone, and to consider all options on the table for growth." (Id.) Redenbach responded that he and Nguyen-Brown were "here to support" Girand and suggested they meet week face-to-face the following week. (Id.)
Girand met with Nguyen-Brown on May 4, 2017. (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement; (Girand Declaration in Support of Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment ("Girand Decl.") ¶ 16.) Nguyen-Brown testified that the purpose of the meeting was [*8]  to discuss Girand's health and ability to work, and also to discuss certain performance concerns. (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 122-23.) He also testified that he told Girand, in sum and substance, that LiveTiles would make "any allowances that he needed around work/life schedule balance to support his treatment." (Id.) Nguyen-Brown said that, at this meeting, Girand did not repeat his request to work from home or for administrative assistance. (Id. at ¶ 124.) Girand, on the other hand, "emphatically den[ies]" that his disability or accommodation were discussed at this meeting. (Girand Decl. ¶ 16.) According to Girand, "[t]he only topic of discussion was [his] production, [his] sales and [his] accounts. There was a passing mention of interactions with co-workers which [Girand] said was getting better and [he] had just had a good conversation with one employee and resolved [their] differences amicably." (Id.)
Girand testified that, as a result of his cancer, among other things, he suffered from fatigue due to his radiation treatments, had pain, which was sometimes "[s]evere," felt a "lot of anxiety" and depression, had night sweats, had a slight limp, experienced difficulty focusing and "emotional [*9]  distraction," and may have had to "miss[] a day or two [of work] here or there." (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 103; Pltf. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 103; Parker Aff. Ex. 1 at 106:3; 109:18; 170:6-15; 172:18-19.)
As of February 13, 2017, Girand testified that his doctors advised him of dietary and alcohol consumption restrictions, and to reduce day-to-day "activities that would cause overstress and overexertion." (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 109; Pltf. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 109.) Girand testified his doctors "didn't specifically say, okay do this, don't do that. Just pull back on your day to day," and he could not recall getting any note or directive from this doctor that he was restricted from doing anything. (Id.)
Nonetheless, Girand testified that he thought he was going "a great job" at LiveTiles and that his doctors had not advised him to seek a modified work schedule. (Id. ¶¶ 110; 115.) On May 6, 2017, he emailed Redenbach and Nguyen-Brown and proposed that he take on the role of "senior sales manager" for three months, in addition to his current role, and that if Redenbach and Nguyen-Brown were satisfied with his performance, they promote him. (Id. ¶ 126.)

C. Girand's Termination
According to Defendants, Redenbach and Nguyen-Brown [*10]  made a joint decision that they needed to fire Girand on May 7, 2017. (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 140.)
Defendants state that the decision "was based on the way Girand treated employees and clients and the need to protect employee [sic] and the business from Girand's destructive behavior." (Id. ¶ 142.) Redenbach testified that at no stage during his May 7, 2017 conversation with Nguyen-Brown did anyone discuss Girand's health or cancer. (Id. ¶ 147.) Girand was terminated on May 8, 2017, during a meeting with Redenbach and Nguyen-Brown. (Id. ¶ 145.)
The parties provide limited documentary evidence about the termination decision. One is an email sent on May 6, 2017, two days before Girand was terminated, between Nguyen-Brown and Redenbach in which they appear to discuss how to communicate with Girand about the need for a conversation. (See Opp. at 18 (citing LiveTiles000577).) The email says: "If we need to protect ourselves, we may need to mention things like his behavior towards others, attitude towards more junior stuff [sic] and the intimidation it creates etc [sic]." (Id.)
Girand also cites another communication between Tania DeJean, who Girand identifies as working in Human Resources, and Jonathan [*11]  Green, who Girand identifies as a financial manager, which appears to discuss what reason to give for Girand's termination and which is copied below:

(Opp. at 19 (citing LiveTiles000573).) DeJean asserts in an affidavit that this discussion concerns what reason to give for Girand's termination, among a limited selection of dropdown options, to a third-party benefits provider. (Affidavit of Tania DeJean ¶¶ 11-21.)

II. STANDARD
Summary judgment is only appropriate where the "materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, [and] other materials" show "that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)-(c). "An issue of fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Senno v. Elmsford Union Free Sch. Dist., 812 F. Supp. 2d 454, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (citing SCR Joint Venture L.P. v. Warshawsky, 559 F.3d 133, 137 (2d Cir. 2009)). A fact is "material" if it might affect the outcome of the litigation under the governing law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The party moving for summary judgment is first responsible for demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. [*12]  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. CSX Lines, L.L.C., 432 F.3d 428, 433 (2d Cir. 2005). If the moving party meets its burden, "the nonmoving party must come forward with admissible evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact for trial in order to avoid summary judgment." Saenger v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., 706 F. Supp. 2d 494, 504 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (quoting Jaramillo v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 536 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 2008)).
In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must "'construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant.'" Brod v. Omya, Inc., 653 F.3d 156, 164 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Williams v. R.H. Donnelley, Corp., 368 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir. 2004)). However, a motion for summary judgment cannot be defeated on the basis of conclusory assertions, speculation, or unsupported alternative explanations of facts. Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 310 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Senno, 812 F. Supp. 2d at 467 (citing Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir. 1998)). The non-moving party must do more than show that there is "some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." McClellan v. Smith, 439 F.3d 137, 144 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)). To defeat a motion for summary judgment, "the non-moving party must set forth significant, probative evidence on which a reasonable fact-finder could decide in its favor." Senno, 812 F. Supp. 2d at 467-68 (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256-57).
Nonetheless, "summary judgment may not be granted simply because the court believes that the plaintiff will be unable to meet his or her burden of persuasion at trial." Danzer v. Norden Sys., Inc., 151 F.3d 50, 54 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal citations omitted). Indeed, "[t]here must either be a lack of evidence in support of [*13]  the plaintiff's position or the evidence must be so overwhelmingly tilted in one direction that any contrary finding would constitute clear error." Id.

III. DISCUSSION
Defendants seek summary judgment on Girand's claims for failure to accommodate his disability, wrongful termination on the basis of disability, age discrimination, national origin discrimination, fraud, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Court addresses each in turn.

A. Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination Claims
Claims of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate in violation of the ADA are analyzed using the McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green burden-shifting framework. See McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co. Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009)). Under that framework, the plaintiff bears the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, Sista v. CDC Ixis North Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006). Establishing a prima facie case "is not a demanding burden." Greenway v. Buffalo Hilton Hotel, 143 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 1998). If the plaintiff can satisfy that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to offer through the introduction of admissible evidence a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment action at issue. Sista, 445 F.3d at 169. If the defendant does, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that [*14]  the employer's proffered reason is pretext for a discriminatory motive. Id. The plaintiff may satisfy this burden either through "the presentation of additional evidence showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence, or by reliance on the evidence comprising the prima facie case." Heyman v. Queens Vill. Comm. for Mental Health for Jamaica Cmty. Adolescent Program, 198 F.3d 68, 72 (2d Cir. 1999). The ultimate burden of "persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Courts also analyze NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims under the McDonnell Douglas framework. See, e.g., Shao v. City of New York, No. 12 Civ. 1566 (RJS), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140125, 2014 WL 5038389, at *10 (Sept. 30, 2014); Nieblas-Love v. New York City Hous. Auth., 165 F. Supp. 3d 51, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). However, the Second Circuit has made clear that NYCHRL claims must be evaluated "independently from and 'more liberally' than their federal and state counterparts.'" Loeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 278 (2d Cir. 2009); see generally Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 109 (2d Cir. 2013) (noting that courts must "constru[e] the NYCHRL's provisions 'broadly in favor of discrimination plaintiffs, to the extent that such a construction is reasonably possible.'") (citation omitted).
1. Plaintiff's Failure to Accommodate Claims
"A plaintiff states a prima facie failure to accommodate claim by demonstrating that (1) plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; [*15]  (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 125- 26 (quoting McBride, 583 F.3d at 97 (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Defendants challenge Plaintiff's ability to meet the first and fourth prongs—that Girand had a qualifying disability, and that they refused to make an accommodation. (See Mot. at 11-17; Repl. at 2-5.)

a. Girand's Disability
Defendants argue that Girand's claim that he is disabled as a result of his cancer fails as a matter of law. (Mot. at 11-17) Specifically, while Defendants concede that the ADA Amendment Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") "substantially broadened the definition of a disability under the ADA," they argue that Girand cannot show that his cancer "substantially limits" a "major life activity" (Mot. at 11; Repl. at 2), as he is required to do. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1) (defining "disability" as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of having such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment"); see also Francis v. Wyckoff Heights Med. Ctr., 177 F. Supp. 3d 754, 768 (E.D.N.Y. 2016).
Defendants cite evidence in support of their claim that [*16]  Girand was not limited in any major life activity, including his ability to work. (Repl. at 2-3; Mot. at 13-14.) Among other things, they say his doctors did not recommend that he alter his life activities, including work, and that "other than dedicating himself to a healthy diet, [Girand] identified no restriction on his ability to function."2 (Id.)
But, Defendants' argument fails to meaningfully address the statutory language of the ADAAA. See Baron v. Advanced Asset & Prop. Mgmt. Sols., LLC, 15 F. Supp. 3d 274, 282 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) ("Although defendant validly points out that plaintiff's claimed disability has not affected his performance at work, the Court must be guided by the clear language of the ADA."). Major life activities are defined to include not just tasks such as work, but also "the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B) (emphasis added); see also Morris v. Town of Islip, No. 12 Civ. 2984 (JFB)(SIL), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133168, 2014 WL 4700227, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2014). As courts have recognized, the inclusion of "normal cell growth" in the definition of "major life activities" means that "[c]ancer will 'virtually always' be a qualifying disability. See, e.g., Katz v. Adecco USA, Inc., 845 F. Supp. 2d 539, 548 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)-(iii) (2011)); see [*17]  also Vera v. Donado Law Firm, No. 17 Civ. 03123 (LGS) (DF), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104635, 2019 WL 3306117, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 19, 2019), report and recommendation adopted, No. 17 Civ. 3123 (LGS), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122477, 2019 WL 3302607 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2019).3
While Defendants quote the statutory language including "normal cell growth," they do not address the application here, focusing instead on other "major life activities," such as working. (See Mot. at 11-17; Repl. at 2-3.) Their discussion of cancer is largely limited to a conclusory citation to three cases in their reply brief, which they say support their argument that cancer is not a per se disability under the ADA. (See Repl. at 2.) One, Thomsen v. Stantec, Inc., does not address the statutory language at all. See 785 F. Supp. 2d 20, 22-23 (W.D.N.Y. 2011). Another, an out-of-Circuit report and recommendation, merely cites to Thomsen as its only support for the statement (offered in a footnote) that "[c]ancer is not a per se disability under the ADA." See LaForge v. Gets Down, No. 17 Civ. 48 (BMM) (TJC), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217410, 2017 WL 8787068, at *4 n. 4 (D. Mont. Dec. 28, 2017), report and recommendation adopted in part, rejected in part sub nom. No. 17 Civ. 48 (BMM)(TJC), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21877, 2018 WL 826380 (D. Mont. Feb. 9, 2018). And the third addresses only part of the statutory language defining "major life activity"—addressing 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A), not (B), which includes "normal cell growth"—and in any event concerns a plaintiff who was diagnosed with cancer 18 years before the alleged wrongdoing occurred. Wade v. New York City Dep't of Educ., No. 11 Civ. 05278 (LGS), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32134, 2014 WL 941754, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2014), aff'd on other grounds, 667 F. App'x 311 (2d Cir. 2016). Indeed, in affirming the District Court's decision in Wade, the Second Circuit noted [*18]  that "[t]he EEOC, in an amicus brief, argues powerfully that Wade's breast cancer constitutes a disability under the ADA, and indeed Wade would qualify under the ADA even if the employer perceived her as disabled," but ultimately decided the issue was "immaterial" because Wade had not shown her employer was motivated by her disability." See 667 F. App'x at 313.
With respect to the NYSHRL and NYCHRL, Defendants concede that the standards for establishing disability under these statutes is more lenient, focusing their arguments on Plaintiff's alleged failure to establish disability under the ADA. (See Mot. at 13 n. 7 (citing Levine v. Smithtown Central School Dist., 565 F. Supp. 2d 407 (E.D.N.Y. 2008); NYC Admin Code. § 8-102(16)(a))) As courts have recognized, "[t]he New York State Executive Law and the New York City Administrative Code have a broader definition of 'disability' than does the ADA; neither statute requires any showing that the disability substantially limits a major life activity." Reilly v. Revlon, Inc., 620 F. Supp. 2d 524, 541 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (citing Giordano v. City of New York, 274 F.3d 740, 753 (2d Cir. 2001). And courts have recognized that cancer may qualify as a disability under these statutes. See, e.g., Katz, 845 F. Supp. 2d at 548-49 ("Plaintiff's breast cancer likely constitutes a "record" of an impairment that limited her "normal bodily function.").
Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants have not established as a matter of law [*19]  that Girand's cancer does not constitute a disability.

b. Refusal to Accommodate
Defendants also challenge Girand's ability to establish the fourth element of a prima facie case for a failure to accommodate claim—that they refused to make a reasonable accommodation for plaintiff's disability. (See Mot. at 17; Repl. at 3-5.) "A reasonable accommodation is one that 'enable[s] an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position . . . [or] to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment." Noll v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 787 F.3d 89, 94-95 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii), (iii)). Specifically, Defendants dispute that (1) Girand made a request for an accommodation, and (2) that they refused that accommodation. (Repl. at 3-4.) The Court takes each argument in turn.

i. Plaintiff's Request
The Second Circuit has recognized that "generally . . . 'it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.'" Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 184-85 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. at 363 (2003); Flemmings v. Howard Univ., 198 F.3d 857, 861, 339 U.S. App. D.C. 110 (D.C. Cir. 1999)).
Defendants point to two emails as indication that Plaintiff made it clear to them that he did not need an accommodation, the first on April 14, 2017 and the second on May 6, 2017, both from Girand to Redenbach and Nguyen-Brown. (Repl. at 4 (citing Parker Aff. Exs. 16, 23).)
With regards to the first [*20]  email, in which Girand disclosed his cancer, Defendants note statements by Girand that his "focus is radically better now and I'm feeling myself again" and about his desire "to continue to work full time." (Repl. at 4; Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 67-72.) With regards to the second, sent a few weeks later, on May 6, 2017, they note that Girand proposed that he take on the role of "senior sales manager" in addition to his current role. (Reply at. 4; Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶126; Parker Aff. Ex. 23.) Defendants also submit evidence that Girand did not reiterate his request at the May 4, 2017 in-person meeting with Nguyen-Brown for a work-from-home accommodation, or for an administrative assistant. (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 124.)
Examining the contents of the April 14, 2017 email, however, the Court believes that a reasonable juror could infer that Girand made a request for an accommodation. In the email, after explaining the nature of his cancer and treatment, Girand specifically states that "[g]oing forward, I'd like to discuss with you both a modified schedule and some way to work from home when not meeting with customers," and after confirming his commitment to working full time at LiveTiles, he repeats that request [*21]  and adds a request for an assistant: "What I would like though is to take a day or two a week to work from home and get a dedicated sales assistant to help me manage the workflow, meetings, reports, account opening and other administrative tasks that come with the role." (Parker Aff. Ex. 16.) The email concludes with a request to meet with Redenbach and Nguyen-Brown in person. (Id.)
The May 6, 2017 email does not make a request for an accommodation, and arguably demonstrates Girand's desire to take on more work, but it was also sent after the May 4, 2017 meeting, at which Defendants claim Nguyen-Brown offered that LiveTiles "would make 'any allowances that he needed around work/life schedule to balance his treatment.'" (See Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 122-23.) Girand denies that his cancer or request for an accommodation were discussed at the May 4, 2017 meeting. (See Girand Decl. ¶ 16.)
A reasonable juror could infer from these documents that Girand was requesting an accommodation as a result of his disability. See Graves, 457 F.3d at 185 ("[W]e believe that a reasonable jury could infer from this testimony that" plaintiff was requesting an accommodation.).

ii. Defendants' Accommodation
Defendants also argue that, [*22]  even if they were required to offer Girand an accommodation, they did in fact offer him one. (See Mot. at 17; Rep. at 4-5.) As Defendants note, an employer is entitled to summary judgment on a failure to accommodate claim if "the employer has already taken (or offered) measures to accommodate the disability." Noll, 787 F.3d at 94 (citing Wernick v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., 91 F.3d 379, 385 (2d Cir. 1996).
Defendants argue that in response to Girand's April 14, 2017 email requesting an accommodation, "Redenbach responded with concern, as did Nguyen-Brown who said they were 'happy to work out a schedule' that would accommodate Plaintiff's needs." (Repl. at 5.) Defendants also aver that at the May 4, 2017 meeting, the purpose of which, they claim, "was to discuss Girand's health and ability to work, and also certain performance concerns," that Nguyen-Brown told Girand that LiveTiles would make "any allowances that he needed around work/life schedule balance to support his treatment." (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 122-23.)
The Court finds that there remains a genuine dispute of material fact as to this issue as well. Nguyen-Brown's offer to "work out a schedule that works best for everyone" could reasonably be read not as an offer to accommodate Plaintiff's requests, but as an offer to discuss the matter [*23]  further. Further, as previously noted, Girand "emphatically den[ies]" in his declaration that his disability or accommodation were discussed at the May 4, 2017 meeting. (Girand Decl. ¶ 16.) Defendants do not say what, if anything, Girand had to say about this meeting at his deposition.4
* * *
Having rejected Defendants' arguments with respect to Girand's ability to make out a prima facie failure to accommodate claim, the Court DENIES Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to these claims.
2. Plaintiff's Wrongful Termination and Retaliation Claims
Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Girand's wrongful termination claims because (1) Girand has not established a disability; (2) he cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination because he cannot show that his termination was imposed because of his disability; (3) even if Girand could make out a prima facie case, Defendants terminated him for a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason; and (4) there is no evidence that Defendants' proffered reason for termination is pretextual. The Court has already considered and rejected the first argument (see supra Section III(A)(1)(a)).
Defendants also seek [*24]  summary judgment on Girand's claim that his termination was a result of retaliation for seeking an accommodation.5 To establish a prima facie retaliation case, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: "(1) she engaged in protected activity, (2) the employer was aware of this activity, (3) she was subjected to an adverse employment action against her, and (4) a causal connection existed between the alleged adverse employment action and her protected activity." McGuire-Welch v. House of the Good Shepherd, 720 F. App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order) (citing Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of City of N.Y., 287 F.3d 138, 148 (2d Cir. 2002)). Defendants challenge Plaintiff's ability to meet the fourth prong, to establish that there was a causal connection between his termination and his request for an accommodation.
The discrimination and retaliation claims are separate and require separate analyses. Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. 2002) ("A plaintiff may prevail on a claim for retaliation even when the underlying conduct complained of was not in fact unlawful."). But, there is substantial evidentiary overlap between the two claims here, as Defendants were only made aware of Girand's disability at the same time that he requested an accommodation.

a. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case
Defendants argue that Girand cannot make out a prima facie case that he was terminated because of his disability [*25]  or as retaliation for seeking an accommodation. As Defendants concede, however, a "plaintiff's burden at this prima facie stage is de minimis. Treglia, 313 F.3d at 719 (citing Richardson v. New York State Dept. of Correctional Serv., 180 F.3d 426, 444 (2d Cir. 1999)).
The Court finds that Girand is able to establish a prima facie case given the proximity of the April 14, 2017 disclosure about his disability, in which he also requested an accommodation, and his eventual termination on May 8, 2017, twenty-four days later. Courts have regularly recognized that "temporal proximity of events give rise to an inference of [discrimination] for purposes of establishing a prima facie case." See Treglia, 313 F.3d at 719; see also Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 110- 11 (2d Cir. 2010) ("Though [the Second Circuit] has not drawn a bright line defining, for the purposes of a prima facie case, the outer limits beyond which a temporal relationship is too attenuated to establish causation, [it has] previously held that five months is not too long to find the causal relationship.")
Having established a prima facie case, and therefore established a presumption that Defendants acted improperly, the burden now shifts to Defendants to provide a non- discriminatory reason for the adverse action. See Clark v. Jewish Childcare Ass'n, Inc., 96 F. Supp. 3d 237, 257 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).

b. Defendants' Stated Justification for Dismissal
Defendants argue that they terminated Girand's [*26]  employment because of the "unceasing complaints they received from employees and clients" about Girand during his short tenure at LiveTiles. (See Mot. at 20-21.)
Among the evidence presented, Defendants say that Mahdi Hamdi, who worked closely with Girand, told Nguyen-Brown at a mid-April meeting that he was considering leaving the company because of Girand's bullying and intimidation of him and other colleagues.6 (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 134; Affidavit of Mahdi Hamdi ("Hamdi Aff.) ¶ 22.) Hamdi says that Girand would dominate meetings (Hamdi Aff. ¶ 9), "speak to [Hamdi] and other colleagues in a rude, belittling, and authoritarian way" (id.), "snap his fingers" at Hamdi (id. ¶ 10), bad-mouth other colleagues (id. ¶ 11), and "would rudely talk over" clients and "not listen to what the client had to say or to the questions about product the client had" (id. ¶ 18).
Defendants also point to a March 17, 2017 email, which Redenbach and Nguyen- Brown received, in which Daniel Goss wrote that one of Girand's colleagues "was pretty pissed at Anthony, he thinks he is a bullshit artist who fails to listen," and which forwarded an email from Girand that Defendants argue was combative. (Parker [*27]  Aff. Ex. 10; Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 25-27.) They also point to a March 25, 2017 email from Girand to a partner, which, on April 3, 2017, Goss forwarded to Redenbach with a note that it "lack[ed] a little in 'bedside manner,'" and that the partner "had gone quiet" since Girand's email. (Parker Aff. Ex. 12; Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶¶ 28-31)
Defendants also provide evidence that Nguyen-Brown and Redenbach were made aware of clients' unhappiness with Girand's behavior. In a March 14, 2017 email, Goss wrote that HBO had "said they would prefer not to deal with Anthony again."7 (Parker Aff. Ex. 7; Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 18.) Goss wrote that "HBO did not appreciate Anthony's behavior. The most senior guy in the meeting asked Anthony to stop talking as he wasn't listening to what HBO were saying. . . . This has happened a few times lately. Anthony has some great attributes but just needs to learn to listen and not talk over people." (Parker Aff. Ex. 7.) Redenbach testified that if "Mr. Girand was still with the company, trying to manage that account, HBO would not be a customer." (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 24.)
Redenbach also testified that he witnessed Girand acting inappropriately towards colleagues. [*28]  (Id. at ¶¶ 34-35). And Girand himself stated in an email that he "need[ed] a reset" with some colleagues, and testified that he wanted a "reboot," especially with Goss, with whom he could sense "tension." (Parker Aff. Ex. 13; Ex. 1 at 151:17-23)8
The Court finds that this evidence is more than sufficient to establish a nondiscriminatory and non-retaliatory reason for Girand's termination.

c. Pretext
Because Defendants have provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory, nonretaliatory reason for Girand's termination, the burden shifts back to Girand to demonstrate that those reasons were pretextual, either false or not the reason for the termination decision. See Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2008); Wellner v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., No. 17 Civ. 3479 (KPF), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147844, 2019 WL 4081898, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 2019).
The Second Circuit has held that while "temporal proximity of events may give rise to an inference of [discrimination or retaliation] for the purposes of establishing a prima facie case . . . without more, such temporal proximity is insufficient to satisfy [Plaintiff's] burden to bring forward some evidence of pretext." El Sayed v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 627 F.3d 931, 933 (2d Cir. 2010); see also Ben-Levy v. Bloomberg, L.P., 518 F. App'x 17, 19-20 (2d Cir. 2013) (recognizing that even a NYCHRL claim does not survive if the only evidence of retaliatory or discriminatory purpose is the temporal proximity between events). Thus, to prevail, Girand must put forward [*29]  additional evidence, beyond temporal proximity.
The strongest evidence Girand points to is portions of his employment contract with LiveTiles. (Opp. at 19-20.) The contract includes a warranty that Girand had "disclosed to LiveTiles any injuries and/or illnesses previously suffered that may affect [his] ability to effectively carry out [his] duties and responsibilities within [his] employment." (See Opp. at 20; Parker Aff. Ex. 2.) The contract warned that "[f]ailure by [Girand] to disclose any relevant factual information may result in termination of [his] employment summarily and/or [him] not being covered by workers' compensation insurance in certain instances." (Id.)
Defendants dismiss this provision, addressed only in a footnote, as "merely requir[ing] potential employees to disclose any illness that could prevent them from doing their jobs." (Repl. at 8 n. 5) The Court is unconvinced that Defendants' cabined reading of this provision is the only one, particularly without evidence about why this provision was included in the contract.
The Second Circuit has "repeatedly expressed the need for caution about granting summary judgment to an employer in a discrimination case where, as here, the merits turn on a dispute as to the employer's [*30]  intent." See Holcomb, 521 F.3d at 137 (citing Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir. 1997); Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. P'ship, 22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir. 1994); Meiri v. Dacon, 759 F.2d 989, 998 (2d Cir. 1985)). As the Circuit has noted, "[w]here an employer has acted with discriminatory intent, direct evidence of that intent will only rarely be available, so that 'affidavits and depositions must be carefully scrutinized for circumstantial proof which, if believed, would show discrimination.'" Id. (citing Gallo, 22 F.3d at 1224).
While not the only reading of these contractual provisions, a juror might reasonably infer from this employment contract that Defendants included this provision because they did not wish people with disabilities, or certain disabilities, to work at their company. Or that these provisions were included to scare an employee away from requesting an accommodation for that disability. And, when Plaintiff disclosed that he had been diagnosed with a disability months before his employment started, and requested an accommodation as a result, he was terminated for doing so.
Deferring to this reading is especially warranted with respect to Girand's NYCHRL claims, which the Second Circuit has made clear must be evaluated "independently from and 'more liberally' than their federal and state counterparts,'" Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 278; see also Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 109, and because "the drafters of the NYCHRL expressed a preference [*31]  for claims to be resolved by juries." Wellner, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147844, 2019 WL 4081898, at *6 (citing Williams v. New York City Hous. Auth., 61 A.D.3d 62, 77, 872 N.Y.S.2d 27 (2009).
Finding a genuine dispute of material fact, Defendants' request for summary judgment on Girand's wrongful termination and retaliation claims is DENIED.

B. Plaintiff's Age Discrimination Claims
Defendants also seek summary judgment on Girand's claim that his termination was the result of discrimination based on age in violation of the Age Discrimination Act, and the NYSHRL and NYCHRL. (Mot. at 23-25.) Girand's age discrimination claims fare worse than his disability claims.
ADEA claims are also considered under the burden-shifting framework articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802-04. See, e.g., Friedman v. Swiss Re Am. Holding Corp., 643 F. App'x 69, 70-71 (2d Cir. 2016). "Under this framework, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by proving: (1) he or she is a member of a protected class; (2) he or she was qualified for the position; (3) he or she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination." Id. (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802).
Age discrimination claims under the NYSHRL "have long been considered to be identical to those under the ADEA," Marcus v. Leviton Mfg. Co., Inc., 661 F. App'x 29, 33 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing Gorzynski, 596 F.3d at 105 n. 6), but while both the ADEA and NYSHRL require "but-for causation," the NYSCHRL [*32]  requires only that plaintiff prove that age was a "motivating factor" for the adverse employment action. Weiss v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., No. 06 Civ. 4402 (DLC), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2505, 2010 WL 114248, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 13, 2010).
1. Prima Facie Case
Defendants challenge Girand's ability to establish causation, and indeed the evidence Girand's put forward on that front is very limited. In his brief opposing summary judgment, Girand argues only that he was the oldest employee at LiveTiles. (Opp. at 21-22.) Although establishing a prima facie case is not difficult, courts have previously found this evidence alone to be insufficient. See Vargas v. Manhattan & Bronx Surface Transit Operating Auth., No. 08 Civ. 9254 (AKH), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42736, 2010 WL 1783555, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2010), aff'd, 436 F. App'x 24 (2d Cir. 2011).
In his Amended Complaint, Girand alleges that after his termination, his responsibilities were assigned to "individuals substantially younger in age" (Am. Compl. ¶ 82), although he provides no evidentiary support for that assertion on summary judgment.

2. Pretext
Nonetheless, even assuming that Girand could make out a prima facie case, he cannot meet the burden that reverts to him after Defendants put forward their legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Girand's termination discussed above, see supra Section III(A)(2)(b).
Girand points to no further evidence of alleged age discrimination, attempting only to show that Defendants' proffered reason is false. The Court finds that he does not convincingly [*33]  do so.
Girand argues about a lack of "supporting documentation that should exist if the employee really was a poor performer" (see Opp. at 21), an argument that ignores the numerous written and oral communications, discussed above, in which complaints against Girand were raised. He argues that there were "no emails or notes to human resources," without citation to authority that supports that proposition, nor with indication of why such evidence would be necessary when the complaints were being received by the individuals who made the termination decision. (See id.)
Elsewhere in his opposition brief, Girand makes other attempts to rebut Defendants' proffered termination reason. The Court finds none convincing, but discusses some below.
Girand cites an email correspondence from Nguyen-Brown to Redenbach two days before he was terminated in which Nguyen-Brown and Redenbach discuss how to communicate with Girand about their need for a conversation. (Opp. at 13, 18.) The email says "[i]f we need to protect ourselves, we may need to mention things like his behavior towards others, attitude towards more junior stuff [sic] and the intimidation it creates etc [sic]." (Opp. at 18 (citing LiveTiles000577).) Girand argues that the [*34]  email, and the reference to the need to "protect" themselves, could be read to betray a discriminatory intent. (Id.) The Court disagrees that such an inference would be reasonable. To the contrary, the statements in the email would tend to support Defendants' stated reasons for Girand's termination.
The same is true of another written exchange between Tania DeJean and Jonathan Green about what reason to give, among a selection of drop-down options, for Girand's termination to a third-party benefits provider. (Opp. at 19.) The reason given, "neglect/performance of duty," is not inconsistent with Defendants' stated reasons for the termination, particularly when compared with the other options being considered by DeJean, and does not suggest a discriminatory motive. Green's concern that Girand might be able to see the selection also does not reasonably suggest an improper intent. (See Opp. at 19.)
Girand also argues that because Defendants had not taken disciplinary action or discussed the reasons for his termination before the May 8, 2017 termination meeting, a jury could find discriminatory or retaliatory intent. (Opp. at 13, 18-19.) This argument, offered without legal support, would seem to be somewhat contradicted by [*35]  evidence that his interactions with co-workers were discussed at the May 4, 2017 meeting between Nguyen-Brown and Girand (see Girand Decl. ¶ 16), but in any event cannot reasonably be read to betray improper motive, particularly when there is evidence that Nguyen- Brown and Redenbach were made aware of complaints about Girand before his termination. See Natofsky v. City of New York, 921 F.3d 337, 351 (2d Cir. 2019) ("[D]rawing all inferences in [plaintiff's] favor, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the explanation of poor performance proffered by [defendants] was pretextual . . . given contemporaneous evidence of plaintiff's poor performance."). The same is true of Plaintiff's claim that a juror might reasonably infer improper intent because Redenbach had previously told Girand that he was "doing great," a statement made on March 16, 2017, a little over a month after Girand's started with LiveTiles and when Defendants were starting to receive evidence of complaints against Girand. (Opp. at 13; Parker Aff. Ex. 13, see supra Section III(A)(2)(b))
* * *
Because Plaintiff cannot establish that his age was a "but-for" cause of termination, as is required for his ADEA and NYSRHL age discrimination claims, Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect [*36]  to those claims is GRANTED.
Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to Girand's NYCHRL age discrimination claims is also GRANTED. While those claims are to be analyzed independently from, and more liberally than, the federal or state discrimination claims, they still require a showing of some evidence from which discrimination can be inferred. See Ben-Levy, 518 F. App'x at 19-20. Here, Girand is unable to establish that his age was even a "motivating factor" in his termination. See Weiss, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2505, 2010 WL 114248, at *1.

C. Plaintiff's National Origin Discrimination Claims
Defendants move for summary judgment on Girand's national origin discrimination claims, brought pursuant to the NYSHRL and NYCHRL. Defendants argue Girand cannot establish that he was terminated because he is American, as claimed in the Amended Complaint. (Mot. at 26-28.)
In support of his claim that he was fired because he was American, Girand offers few facts. He claims that "at the time of hire, all of the managers, supervisors and board members of the Australian-listed public company of LiveTiles were either of Australian or New Zealand heritage, including Defendants Redenbach, Nguyen-Brown, Goss and witnesses Salter, Hennessey, [sic] Ferguson." (Opp. at 21.) Elsewhere he adds [*37]  that: he "was hired to manage accounts for" an individual on maternity leave who "is Australian"; the "co-worker assigned to work under" Girand "is Australian"; and the "employee who replaced Girand on several accounts after he left . . . is Australian." (Opp. at 23.)
The Court notes, however, that Girand does not provide adequate factual support for these statements. Only the statement on page 21 cites a source, and, even then, simply to "Defendants Statement of Undisputed Facts." (See Opp. at 21.) But these facts are not supported by statements in that document either. The closest thing to support in Defendants' Rule 56.1 Statement comes from a statement offered by Girand in deposition, which Defendants offer to show the paltry nature of Girand's national origin discrimination claims (see Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 157), and which Girand claims is a disputed fact (see Pltf. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 157): "Well, the CEO is Australian, the COO is Australian. The colleague I worked with was Australian. The CFO is Australian. The new guy they hired is Australian. You know, I felt like I was suddenly working from New York for, you know, the Australian Trump family . . . But it always felt kind of - just odd being there as part of - being [*38]  an American [sic] New York office but working in Australia, basically."9 (See Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 157 (citing Girand Dep. Tr. (Parker Ex. 1.) at 119:24-120:8).)
In any event, even if these statements were true, the legal analysis with respect to Girand's age discrimination claims applies here as well. Girand fails to provide evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that he was terminated as a result of his national origin, and certainly cannot rebut Defendants' stated reason for termination. See, e.g., Mavrommatis v. Carey Limousine Westchester, Inc., 476 F. App'x 462, 465 (2d Cir. 2011); Jacob v. NYSARC, Inc., No. 13 Civ. 1677 (KPF), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166470, 2014 WL 6750654, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2014) (finding "conclusory allegations of discrimination, and complaints about her co-workers' allegedly anti-American sentiments, are insufficient to give rise to any inference of discrimination"); Vinokur v. Sovereign Bank, 701 F. Supp. 2d 276, 288 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) ("Plaintiff's conclusory allegation that she was terminated based on her national origin is insufficient to give rise to an inference of discrimination or raise a triable issue of fact for trial."). It is undisputed that at the time that Girand was terminated the great majority of LiveTiles employees were American (32 of 44).10 (Defs. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 161; Pltf. Rule 56.1 Statement ¶ 161) And, Girand does not point to any remark by a LiveTiles employee that would support an inference of discriminatory [*39]  intent. (Id. at ¶ 160.)11
While the bar is lower with respect to his NYCHRL claims, causation remains an element and "a defendant is not liable if the plaintiff fails to prove the conduct is caused at least in part by discriminatory or retaliatory motives." Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 113; see also Goonewardena v. New York Workers Comp. Bd., 258 F. Supp. 3d 326, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), aff'd sub nom. Goonewardena v. New York State Workers' Comp. Bd., 788 F. App'x 779 (2d Cir. 2019). And Girand has not demonstrated that he was terminated, even in part, because he is American.
Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to Girand's national origin discrimination claims is GRANTED.

D. Plaintiff's Fraud Claim
Defendants move for summary judgment with respect to Girand's fraud claim. (Mot. at 28-29; Repl. at 9-10) As stated in the Amended Complaint, the fraud claim centers on allegedly false statements that LiveTiles employees made, and on which Girand allegedly relied in accepting employment at LiveTiles. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 98- 101.)
Under New York law, the elements of a claim for fraud are: "(1) a material misrepresentation or omission of fact (2) made by defendant with knowledge of its falsity (3) and intent to defraud; (4) reasonable reliance on the part of the plaintiff; and (5) resulting damage to the plaintiff." Crigger v. Fahnestock & Co., 443 F.3d 230, 234 (2d Cir. 2006). Defendants argue that Girand provides no evidence of a false [*40]  statement, fails to show intent and reliance, and also cannot show damages. (Mot. at 28-29.)
In his opposition brief, Girand appears to abandon his fraud claim as framed in his pleading, and reframes it to relate to provisions in his employment contract about how sales would be credited for purposes of meeting targets to qualify for a bonus, which he alleges Defendants did not follow. (Opp. at 23-27.) Girand states that he suffered damages because, although he was only employed for less than 100 days, he would have met this bonus target "had he not been wrongfully terminated." (Id. at 27.)
But because it is undisputed that, under either Girand's or LiveTiles's measure, Girand had not met his sales targets by the time of his termination, he cannot show that he was damaged as a result of the alleged fraud. See Connaughton v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 135 A.D.3d 535, 538, 23 N.Y.S.3d 216 (N.Y. App. Div. 2016), aff'd, 29 N.Y.3d 137, 53 N.Y.S.3d 598, 75 N.E.3d 1159 (2017) (noting that the measure of damages for fraud is the "out-of-pocket rule . . . damages are calculated to compensate plaintiffs for what they lost because of the fraud, not for what they might have gained in the absence of fraud") (citing Lama Holding Co. v. Smith Barney, 88 NY2d 413, 421, 668 N.E.2d 1370, 646 N.Y.S.2d 76 (1996)). Rather, Girand's statement that he would have received the bonus allocation he claims "had he not been wrongfully terminated" suggests that what he is seeking [*41]  here is damages not for fraud, but for wrongful termination.
Accordingly, Defendants' request for summary judgment with respect to Girand's fraud claim is GRANTED.

E. Plaintiff's Breach of Contract Claim
Defendants seek summary judgment on Girand's claims that Defendants breached Girand's employment contract by terminating him for "unlawful or discriminatory reasons" and terminating him without the two-weeks-notice contemplated in the agreement. (Opp. at 29-30; see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 51-56.)
Girand's employment contract, which specified that LiveTiles could terminate Girand "at will, at any time," stated that Girand could not be terminated for "unlawful or discriminatory reasons," and required two-weeks-notice unless the "reason of termination was due to non-performance or serious misconduct." (Parker Aff. Ex. 2 at LiveTiles000018.) Because the Court disagrees that Defendants have established that they fired Girand for a permissible reason and that he was terminated for nonperformance or serious misconduct, there remain genuine disputes of material fact as to this claim. Accordingly, Defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to Girand's breach of contract claim is DENIED.

F. Plaintiff's Breach [*42]  of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Claim
Defendants seek summary judgment on Girand's claims that Defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by (1) "reassigning accounts away from Girand in order to frustrate his ability to meet quotas, and demonstrate his ability to increase his sales and revenues to the Company and qualification [sic] for promotion"; and (2) "manufacturing false claims of misconduct and/or negative client and employee complaints against Girand in order to justify a pretextual termination." (Am. Compl. ¶ 62; Mot. at 30.)
Defendants argue the claim is duplicative of the breach of contract claim, and that the implied covenant does not attach to at-will employment contracts. (Mot. at 30.)
Girand fails to respond to Defendants' arguments. (See Opp. at 27-28.) And, as such, the Court deems Girand's breach of the implied covenant claim to be abandoned. See Brandon v. City of New York, 705 F. Supp. 2d 261, 268 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that claims are abandoned when party fails to rebut argument that claims should be dismissed and collecting cases). In any event, courts have held that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not attach to at-will employment contracts. See, e.g., Nunez v. A-T Fin. Info. Inc., 957 F. Supp. 438, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) ("As the courts [*43]  within this district have repeatedly recognized, well-settled New York law holds that no implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing attaches to at-will employment contracts.")
Accordingly, Defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to Girand's claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is GRANTED.
