Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Timothy Hamilton filed the above-captioned action on August 28, 2017, and filed an Amended Complaint [3] on August 29, 2017. Plaintiff claims that his former employer, Schneider National Carriers, Inc., discriminated against him on the basis of a disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. The action is before the Court on the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [38]. For the reasons discussed below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [38] be GRANTED and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant on all of Plaintiff's claims in the Amended Complaint.

I. FACTS
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts [*2]  from the "Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts" [38-1] ("Def. SMF"), and the Plaintiff's "Statement of Additional Material Facts" [47] ("Pl. SMF"). The Court also draws some facts from Plaintiff's "Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts" [45] ("Pl. Resp. SMF"), and the Defendant's "Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts" [51] ("Def. Resp. SMF").
The Defendant has objected to the Court's consideration of the Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts [47] on the ground that it was not timely filed with the Court. See Def. Resp. SMF at 1-2 ("Schneider objects to each and every Paragraph set forth in Plaintiff's SAMF because they were untimely filed and should not be considered when ruling on Schneider's Motion for Summary Judgment"). The docket reflects that the deadline for Plaintiff to respond to the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment was extended until September 26, 2018. See Order [43]. Although Plaintiff filed his "Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment" [44] on September 26, 2018, Plaintiff did not file his Statement of Additional Material Facts [47] until the following day, September [*3]  27, 2018. Plaintiff failed to file any motion requesting leave of Court to file his Statement of Additional Material Facts out of time. Thus, Defendant is correct that Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts [47] was not timely filed with the Court. Nevertheless, the Court has exercised its discretion to consider Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts as it was filed only one day late, and there does not appear to be significant prejudice. The Court cautions Plaintiff that in the future, the Court may not consider untimely filed material.
For those facts submitted by the Defendant that are supported by citations to record evidence, and for which the Plaintiff has not expressly disputed with citations to record evidence, the Court must deem those facts admitted, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1B. See LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGa ("This Court will deem each of the movant's facts as admitted unless the respondent: (i) directly refutes the movant's fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (ii) states a valid objection to the admissibility of the movant's fact; or (iii) points out that the movant's citation does not support the movant's fact [*4]  or that the movant's fact is not material or otherwise has failed to comply with the provisions set out in LR 56.1 B.(1).").
Accordingly, for those facts submitted by Defendant that Plaintiff has failed to dispute with citations to record evidence, the Court must accept the facts as true, so long as the facts are supported by citations to record evidence, do not make credibility determinations, and do not involve legal conclusions. See E.E.O.C. v. Atlanta Gastroenterology Associates, LLC, No. CIV. A. 1:05-CV-2504-TWT, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11312 2007 WL 602212, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2007). The Court has nevertheless viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on a defendant's motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
The Court has excluded assertions of fact by either party that are clearly immaterial, or presented as arguments or legal conclusions, and has excluded assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record, or asserted only in a party's brief and not in its statement of facts. See LR 56.1B(1), NDGa ("The court will not consider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence . . . or (d) set out only in the brief and not in the movant's [or respondent's] statement of undisputed facts."); [*5]  see also LR 56.1B(2)(b) (respondent's statement of facts must also comply with LR 56.1B(1)). Indeed, both parties object to some of the opposing party's proffered facts on various grounds, including that the asserted fact is not relevant or material to the claims and defenses presented in this case. Nevertheless, the Court includes certain facts that are not necessarily material, but which are helpful to present the context of the parties' arguments. The Court will not rule on each objection or dispute presented by the parties, and will discuss those objections and disputes only when necessary to do so regarding a genuine dispute of a material issue of fact.
Defendant Schneider National Carriers, Inc. ("Schneider") is a transportation and logistics company that operates as a common and contract motor carrier throughout the United States and Canada, and it employs more than 10,000 drivers nationwide. Def. SMF at ¶ 1; Pl. SMF at ¶ 15. Schneider has implemented an Equal Opportunity Employer Policy and Disability Accommodation Policy, which all employees can access on Schneider's intranet. Def. SMF at ¶ 1; Declaration of Ryan Burzinski ("Burzinski Decl.") ¶ 4. Schneider's policy prohibits discrimination based upon [*6]  "physical or mental disability... or any other classification protected by applicable federal, state, or local law." Def. SMF at ¶ 2; Burzinski Decl. ¶¶ 4-5. Schneider contends that it enforces its Equal Opportunity Employer Policy and Disability Accommodation Policy and takes steps to ensure that all employees are aware of and understand these policies. Burzinski Decl. ¶¶ 4-5. Plaintiff does not dispute that Schneider has an Equal Opportunity Employer Policy and Disability Accommodation Policy but contends that it "disregarded" the policies with respect to him. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 2; Pl. SMF at ¶ 62; Pl. Decl. [46] at ¶ 29.
Schneider hired Plaintiff Timothy Hamilton on or around November 13, 2013 as a Regional Driver based out of Atlanta. Def. SMF at ¶ 3; Pl. SMF at ¶ 1. About a year later, Plaintiff transferred to the McCalla, Alabama hub to work as a Van Driver on the Home Depot dedicated account. Def. SMF at ¶ 3; Pl. Dep. [39-1] at 67, 74. In May of 2015, Schneider approved Plaintiff's request to transfer to Schneider's McDonough, Georgia hub, which covers a geographic region that includes Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Def. SMF at ¶ 4. While Plaintiff does not [*7]  dispute that the region includes those states, he contends that it also covers Florida and Mississippi. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 4; Pl. SMF at ¶ 37; Pl. Decl. ¶ 4. As a result of the transfer, Veann Nguyen, Schneider's Account Service Manager for the Home Depot dedicated account in McDonough, became Plaintiff's supervisor. Def. SMF at ¶ 4.
Plaintiff's primary job duty as a Van Driver on the Home Depot dedicated account was to haul freight for Home Depot. Def. SMF at ¶ 5. Van Drivers are assigned loads of freight that must be transported from one location to another. Def. SMF at ¶ 5. According to Schneider, it also assigns Van Drivers based in the McDonough, Georgia hub a "backhaul," which means the driver will pick up another shipment in or around the destination and deliver the backhaul to a location on the driver's return trip to McDonough. Def. SMF at ¶ 6; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 4. Dispatching loads in this fashion allows Schneider to meet customer needs while maximizing economic and operational efficiencies. Def. SMF at ¶ 6; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 4. Plaintiff contends that Van Drivers are not always assigned a "backhaul" and sometimes "bobtail," which means driving with no trailer and hauling no freight [*8]  on the return to the hub. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 6; Pl. SMF at ¶ 44; Pl. Decl. ¶ 11.
To meet Home Depot's needs and demands, Schneider contends that it requires Van Drivers in the McDonough, Georgia hub to be ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours per eight-day period. Def. SMF at ¶ 7; Burzinski Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. B; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 6. According to Schneider, these are essential job requirements designed to provide both Schneider and the drivers with maximum scheduling flexibility while ensuring full compliance with the Department of Transportation's Hours of Service Regulations ("DOT Regulations"). Def. SMF at ¶ 7; Burzinski Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. B ("Essential Job Functions Analysis" form stating that the position of "Van Driver (Basic)" for Schneider National requires 11 hours of driving and 14 consecutive hours "on-duty," with 10 hours "off-duty"))); Nguyen Decl. ¶ 6. Plaintiff disputes this and contends that no Schneider employee ever told him of these requirements, nor was he aware of a written policy including those requirements. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 7; Pl. SMF at ¶ 38; Pl. Decl. ¶ 5.
Defendant contends that, during the time period in which Nguyen served as the Account [*9]  Service Manager for the Home Depot account from April of 2014 to January of 2018, no Van Driver in the McDonough, Georgia hub was excused, on a regular or permanent basis, from the requirement of being ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours in an eight-day period. Def. SMF at ¶ 8; Nguyen Decl. ¶¶ 2, 6. Plaintiff contends, however, that there were Van Drivers who were excused "on a regular or permanent basis, from the requirement of being ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours in an eight-day period." Pl. SMF at ¶ 40; Pl. Decl. ¶ 7. In response, Defendant objects to the Plaintiff's contention on the basis that Plaintiff has failed to provide any foundation to establish his "personal knowledge" of that fact, and because Plaintiff has admitted that he does not have knowledge of other driver's work schedules, and admitted that he cannot name even one driver who was excused from that requirement. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 40; Pl. Dep. at 111-16.
Plaintiff further contends that "he was aware of at least two people who worked fewer than 11 hours per day and who may have been employed part time," although he fails to identify either of [*10]  those individuals. Pl. SMF at ¶ 41; Pl. Decl. ¶ 8. In response, Defendant objects to the Plaintiff's contention on the basis that Plaintiff has failed to provide any foundation to establish his "personal knowledge" of that fact, and because Plaintiff has admitted that he does not have knowledge of other driver's work schedules, and admitted that he cannot name even one driver who was excused from the "essential job requirement of being ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours in an eight-day period." Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 41; Pl. Dep. at 111-16.
Plaintiff also contends that light-duty assignments were available at Schneider's Driver's Service Center for drivers who are injured or otherwise unable to perform their regular duties, and further contends that Schneider "regularly recruits for part-time Dedicated Van Drivers." Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 5, 7, 8, 45, 46; Pl. Decl. ¶¶ 12-13. Defendant has also objected to those contentions on the basis that Plaintiff has no "admissible evidence" that anyone who worked as a driver for the Home Depot account in the McDonough hub did so on a "light duty" or part-time basis, or that Schneider ever recruited any driver to work on that [*11]  account to work on a part-time basis. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 5, 7, 8, 45, 46.
Defendant contends that scheduling flexibility is of utmost importance in the trucking industry, and especially for the Home Depot account, due to unpredictable and fluctuating customer needs, tight delivery schedules, inclement weather, and delays during the route. Def. SMF at ¶ 9; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 5; Burzinski Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. B. Plaintiff disputes that and contends that safety is of the utmost importance in the trucking industry. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 9; Pl. SMF at ¶ 49; Pl. Decl. ¶ 16.
The volume of freight that needed to be delivered for the Home Depot account by Van Drivers based in the McDonough, Georgia hub fluctuated greatly from month-to-month. Def. SMF at ¶ 10; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 6. Defendant contends that, during the relevant time period, only 15 to 20 Van Drivers worked on the Home Depot account in McDonough, Georgia, thus Schneider needed all drivers in McDonough to be available to work the maximum hours allowed under the DOT Regulations in order to meet the needs of Home Depot. Def. SMF at ¶ 11; Nguyen Decl. ¶¶ 5-6. Plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that only 12 to 15 drivers were on the Home Depot account. [*12]  Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 11; Pl. Dep. at 104. Defendant also contends that, as a Van Driver on the Home Depot account based in McDonough, Georgia, Plaintiff worked at least 55-60 hours per week most of the time. Def. SMF at ¶ 12; Pl. Dep. at 114 ("Most time you get, like on my pay stub say like 55, 60 hours per week."). It is undisputed that drivers on the Home Depot account typically averaged 12 hours per day. Pl. SMF at ¶ 33; Burzinski Dep. 61.
Deliveries for the Home Depot account in the McDonough, Georgia hub are scheduled and assigned in a manner to usually allow most Van Drivers sufficient time to make a return trip to McDonough at the end of the work day. Def. SMF at ¶ 13; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 7. Being able to make a return trip back to the McDonough, Georgia hub at the end of work day was a well-known perk of working on the Home Depot account in McDonough, and according to Defendant, this was the reason Plaintiff requested the transfer to McDonough. Def. SMF at ¶ 14; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 7. Plaintiff contends that he sought to transfer to McDonough because the account paid more than working on the McCalla account and "the position promised weekly home time and weekends off." Pl. Resp. SMF at [*13]  ¶ 14; Pl. SMF at ¶ 36; Pl. Decl. ¶¶ 3, 14.
Schneider contends that, in order to be able to assign routes in a manner that would usually allow most Van Drivers sufficient time to make a return trip to McDonough, it required maximum scheduling flexibility from its Van Drivers based in McDonough. Def. SMF at ¶ 15; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 8. Plaintiff disputes this. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 15; Pl. SMF at ¶ 42; Pl. Decl. ¶ 9. Assigning routes in a manner that would usually allow most Van Drivers sufficient time to make a return trip to McDonough also made business sense because it allowed Schneider to routinely assign drivers backhauls to deliver on their return trip, but it also required drivers to have sufficient driving hours remaining to guarantee that the backhauls were timely delivered. Def. SMF at ¶ 16; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 8. Plaintiff contends that whether a driver has sufficient driving hours remaining "is a consideration that is always relevant, irrespective of Schneider's desire to maximize the assigning routes and the delivery of backhauls." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 16; Pl. SMF at ¶ 43; Pl. Decl. ¶ 10.
In late June of 2015, Plaintiff submitted a request for vacation, but Schneider was not able to approve [*14]  his request due to business needs. Def. SMF at ¶ 17; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 9. On June 29, 2015, Plaintiff sent a message via his truck's Qualcomm system to Schneider's after-hours support center based in Green Bay, Wisconsin in which he stated that he "was enduring a lot of stress due to the overload of assignments," but did not mention that he suffered from any other ailment. Def. SMF at ¶ 18. Qualcomm is a navigation and messaging system with built-in GPS connected to the truck, which allows Schneider to track the driver's work hours, monitor the truck's location and movement, and send and receive messages with the driver, similar to email. Def. SMF at ¶ 19.
Shortly after receiving Plaintiff's Qualcomm message, Schneider's Associate Human Resources Business Partner, Cassie Byers, called Plaintiff to follow up on his Qualcomm message, but Plaintiff did not answer his telephone, so Byers left Plaintiff a voicemail message. Def. SMF at ¶ 20. Plaintiff and Byers spoke by phone on July 6, 2015 and during this conversation, Plaintiff explained to Byers that he was suffering from job-related stress. Def. SMF at ¶ 21. Schneider contends that Byers informed Plaintiff of his right to take medical [*15]  leave under the FMLA, irrespective of the fact that Schneider recently denied his vacation request. Def. SMF at ¶ 21; Pl. Dep. at 154-59. Plaintiff disputes this and contends that he and Byers never discussed FMLA leave. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 21; Pl. SMF at ¶ 49; Pl. Decl. ¶ 17.
On July 7, 2015, Plaintiff went to Schneider's Atlanta Operating Center, completed a request for leave, signed the form and submitted it to Schneider. Def. SMF at ¶ 22; Pl. Dep. at 161-70. While Defendant contends that this form was a "medical leave request form," Plaintiff contends that he "signed what he believed was a vacation request form." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 22; Pl. SMF at ¶ 51; Pl. Dep. at 168-70; Pl. Decl. ¶ 18. It is undisputed, however, that, on or around July 9, 2015, Plaintiff received a letter from Schneider informing him of his eligibility for leave under the FMLA and requesting additional medical information to support his FMLA leave request. Def. SMF at ¶ 23; Pl. Dep. at 159-65, Ex. J. Plaintiff provided the FMLA forms to his physician Dr. Catherine Burley. Def. SMF at ¶ 24. On July 23, 2015, Schneider received Plaintiff's FMLA medical certification forms completed by Dr. Burley and approved his [*16]  FMLA leave request, starting on July 7, 2015 and ending on July 27, 2015. Def. SMF at ¶ 24; Pl. Dep. at 10. 170-76, Ex. K, L.
Plaintiff's FMLA certification, dated July 21, 2015, states that Plaintiff was suffering from "extreme stress and fatigue due to work-related stress" which caused neck pain, fatigue and dehydration. Def. SMF at ¶ 25; Pl. Dep. at 14-75, Ex. K. Plaintiff's FMLA certification dated July 21, 2015 also states that Plaintiff could return to work on July 27, 2015 with the following permanent restrictions: (1) no working more than 8-9 hours per day; and (2) no working more than 45-50 hours per week. Def. SMF at ¶ 26; Pl. Dep. at 178-79, Ex. L.
On August 10, 2015, Dr. Burley completed another medical certification imposing similar permanent restrictions on Plaintiff: (1) no sitting more than 7-10 hours per day; and (2) no working more than 8-10 hours per day. Def. SMF at ¶ 27; Pl. Dep. at 195-200, Ex. M. Like the July 21, 2015 certification, the August 10, 2015 certification does not identify any specific medical condition other than job-related stress. Def. SMF at ¶ 27. When Plaintiff presented his permanent work restrictions to Schneider, Schneider informed Plaintiff [*17]  that it could not excuse him from performing one of the essential functions of the Van Driver position on a permanent basis, namely being ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours per eight-day period, consistent with the schedule that Schneider required for all other Van Drivers in McDonough. Def. SMF at ¶ 28; Nguyen Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10.
While Plaintiff does not dispute that he was informed that he would not be excused on a permanent basis, he contends that Schneider never informed him that "being ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours per eight-day period" was a requirement of his position as a Van Driver. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 28; Pl. SMF at ¶ 39; Pl. Decl. ¶ 6. Plaintiff also contends that Schneider "could have potentially accommodated" him on a temporary basis. Pl. SMF at ¶ 13; Nguyen Dep. 18-19. He further contends that no alternative positions were offered to him, but he would have accepted light-duty, part-time employment, or employment on another account. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 9, 19, 34, 47; Burzinski Dep. 65; Pl. Decl. ¶ 14.
It is undisputed that Schneider approved Plaintiff for additional FMLA leave and extended the leave period through [*18]  September 27, 2015. Def. SMF at ¶ 29; Pl. SMF at ¶ 52; Pl. Dep. at 208-09, Ex. P. Plaintiff contends that, while he was paid through July 31, 2015, he earned no pay from August to November of 2015. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 22-31; Burzinski Dep. 42-43.
Plaintiff contends that, on August 12, 2015, he was administered a "DOT physical" at Concentra Medical Centers of Georgia and the result was "able to perform essential functions" and "no medical restrictions." Pl. SMF at ¶ 18; Burzinski Dep., Ex. 10. Defendant contends, however, that Plaintiff admits that he did not believe he could return to work at that time. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 18; Pl. Dep. 205-08 (Plaintiff testified that he "did not believe" that he could return to work with no restrictions and, as of August 12, 2015, Dr. Burley had not released him to return to work). On September 2, 2015, Dr. Burley diagnosed Plaintiff with "cervical spinal stenosis" and issued new restrictions, prohibiting him from working in any capacity until he consulted with a neurosurgeon, which was scheduled for October of 2015. Def. SMF at ¶ 30; Pl. Dep. at 216-19, Ex. Q, R. After Plaintiff exhausted his FMLA leave entitlement on September 27, 2015, Schneider allowed [*19]  Plaintiff to remain on medical leave. Def. SMF at ¶ 32; Burzinski Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. C.
On or around October 13, 2015, Plaintiff's new physician, Dr. Paul King, diagnosed Plaintiff with a herniated disc and recommended surgery. Def. SMF at ¶ 33; Pl. Dep. at 229-31, Ex. V. On October 19, 2015, Schneider received a letter from Dr. Burley informing Schneider of Dr. King's diagnosis and Plaintiff's need for surgery to remedy the herniated disc, but Dr. Burley's letter did not provide any additional information, such as the expected date of Plaintiff's surgery and whether he would be able to return to work after his surgery. Def. SMF at ¶ 34; Pl. Dep. at 229-31, Ex. V.
Defendant contends that, after it received Dr. Burley's October 19, 2015 letter, Schneider's Leave Analyst Ryan Burzinski attempted to contact Plaintiff numerous times. Def. SMF at ¶ 35; Burzinski Decl. ¶¶ 10-14. Plaintiff disputes this and contends that he "received no email or voicemails." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 35; Pl. Decl. ¶ 22. Plaintiff does not dispute, however, that on October 20, 2015 and November 5, 2015, Burzinski sent letters to Plaintiff reminding him that Schneider needed additional medical information in order to assess [*20]  whether it could provide a reasonable accommodation for his medical condition. Def. SMF at ¶ 36; Burzinski Decl. ¶¶ 10-11; Pl. Dep. at 231-37, Ex. W, X. Plaintiff received Burzinski's letters sent on October 20, 2015 and November 5, 2015, but he never contacted anyone at Schneider to respond to the letters. Def. SMF at ¶ 37; Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 37; Pl. Decl. ¶ 21. Plaintiff contends that he "provided the letters to either Dr. Burley or Dr. King and asked that she or he respond on his behalf." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 37, 42; Pl. SMF at ¶ 54; Pl. Decl. ¶ 21.
According to the Defendant, Burzinski called Plaintiff and left voicemail messages on November 5, 2015; November 10, 2015; and November 13, 2015; and Nguyen tried to call Plaintiff on November 10, 2015, but Plaintiff did not answer or return any of these calls. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 38-41; Burzinski Decl. ¶¶ 12-15; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 12. Plaintiff contends that he has "no record" of these calls or messages, but he remembers speaking to Burzinski, although he does not remember the date. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 38-41; Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 55-58; Pl. Decl. ¶¶ 22-25. After receiving Dr. Burley's October 19, 2015 letter, Schneider did not receive any further information [*21]  from Plaintiff or his health care providers about his medical condition. Def. SMF at ¶ 42; Burzinski Decl. ¶ 15.
On November 16, 2015, Schneider sent a final reminder letter to Plaintiff stating that Schneider needed to hear from him as soon as possible so it could determine whether he intended to return to work, and informing him that, if Schneider did not hear from Plaintiff by November 20, 2015, it would assume that Plaintiff did not intend on returning to work and would treat his absence as a voluntary resignation. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 44-45; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. A; Pl. Dep. at 240-41, Ex. Y. Although Plaintiff does not dispute that Schneider sent him a letter dated November 16, 2015, he contends that he did not receive it until "about two weeks after the date on the letter." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 44-46; Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 59, 65; Pl. Dep. at 240-41; Pl. Decl. ¶ 26.
Although previous correspondence had been sent to Plaintiff's P.O. Box, the letter dated November 16, 2015 was sent to Plaintiff's home address, and Schneider did not send the letter by certified mail with return receipt requested. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 63-64; Burzinski Dep. 96-98. It is undisputed that Plaintiff never contacted Schneider [*22]  after receiving the letter. Def. SMF at ¶ 46; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 14; Pl. Dep. at 241-42.
On November 23, 2015, Schneider terminated Plaintiff's employment. Def. SMF at ¶ 47; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 14. According to Defendant, Schneider terminated Plaintiff's employment for job abandonment. Def. SMF at ¶ 47; Nguyen Decl. ¶ 14. Plaintiff contends that Schneider terminated his employment "because of his disability." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 47; Pl. SMF at ¶ 60; Pl. Decl. ¶ 27.
Plaintiff has been completely unable to work in any capacity, with or without reasonable accommodation, since Dr. Burley diagnosed him with "cervical spinal stenosis" and restricted him from working in any capacity starting on September 2, 2015. Def. SMF at ¶ 48; Pl. Dep. at 23-24, 36-37 (Plaintiff testified that he has not sought employment since June 1, 2015 because he is completely unable to work), 218-19, Ex. R. According to Defendant, no physician has "cleared" Plaintiff to return to work in any capacity since his September 2, 2015 diagnosis. Def. SMF at ¶ 48. Plaintiff contends, however, that he "has been told that he could work 'light duty.'" Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 48; Pl. SMF at ¶ 61; Pl. Decl. ¶ 28.
On November 19, 2015, Plaintiff [*23]  filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging discrimination and retaliation based on a disability. Pl. SMF at ¶ 2; Pl. Ex. 2. On December 14, 2015, Plaintiff filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC, also alleging discrimination and retaliation based on a disability. Pl. SMF at ¶ 3, Pl. Ex. 3. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he received a Notice of Right to Sue from the EEOC on both charges of discrimination and that he timely filed this lawsuit within 90 days of receipt of that Notice. Am. Comp. [3] at ¶ 7.

II. DISCUSSION
A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is authorized when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 175, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); Bingham, Ltd. v. United States, 724 F.2d 921, 924 (11th Cir. 1984). The movant carries this burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). In making its determination, the court must view [*24]  the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.
Once the moving party has adequately supported its motion, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmoving party's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
If a fact is found to be material, the court must also consider the genuineness of the alleged factual dispute. Id. An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Id. at 250. A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 242. Moreover, for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." [*25]  Id. at 586. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 587 (quoting First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968)). Thus, the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict: "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 259.
When considering motions for summary judgment, the court does not make decisions as to the merits of disputed factual issues. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249; Ryder Int'l Corp. v. First Am. Nat'l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, the court only determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried. Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those that are irrelevant. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do not resolve or affect the outcome of a suit will not properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id.
B. Plaintiff's Claims
In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts two counts against Defendant, both asserted under the ADA. In Count I, Plaintiff asserts a claim against Defendant under the ADA for "disability discrimination." Am. Comp. [3] at ¶¶ 35-50. Plaintiff alleges that, at all relevant times, he was a qualified individual [*26]  with a disability under the ADA, and that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation, but Defendant terminated his employment because of his "disability, perceived disability, or record of having a disability." Id. at ¶¶ 42-44.
In Count II of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim against Defendant for "failure to accommodate in violation of ADA." Id. at ¶¶ 51-67. Plaintiff alleges that, at all relevant times, he was a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA, and that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation. Id. ¶¶ 45-57. Plaintiff alleges that he "requested that Defendant accommodate his disability by allowing him to take intermittent medical leave to attend to periodic doctor's appointments," but "Defendant failed to engage in any interactive process with Plaintiff regarding his request for a reasonable accommodation of his disability." Id. ¶¶ 59-60. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant failed to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation for his disability and that refusal violated the ADA. Id. at ¶¶ 61-62.
1. Standards of Proof under the ADA
The ADA was [*27]  "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (Carnes, J.) (quoting Harding v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F.Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). Title I of the ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001).
The definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of that individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity").
In general, the burden of proof for a claim [*28]  of disability discrimination under the ADA is based on the framework established by the Supreme Court for Title VII employment discrimination cases in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Durley v. APAC, Inc., 236 F.3d 651, 657 (11th Cir. 2000) (McDonnell Douglas framework generally applies to disability discrimination claims under the ADA); see also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 50 n.3, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003) (reviewing disparate treatment disability claim under McDonnell Douglas framework and noting that courts of appeals use this framework in disparate treatment ADA cases); Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007), Bennett v. Dominguez, 196 Fed. Appx. 785, 791 (11th Cir. 2006).
Under this framework, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, a plaintiff may establish a claim under the ADA by first presenting a prima facie case through circumstantial evidence of discrimination under the same burden-shifting analysis used in Title VII employment discrimination cases. Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1242; see also Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999). If a plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of a disability, the burden would shift to the defendant to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action, such as termination. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004). If the defendant produced evidence of a legitimate reason for the adverse action that was unrelated to the alleged disability, the burden would then shift back to the plaintiff to "demonstrate that the [*29]  defendant's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is a mere pretext for discrimination." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir. 1997).
For those cases in which an employee claims that an employer violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability, however, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting framework does not apply. See Nadler, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *9 ("An employer must reasonably accommodate an otherwise qualified employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship in the operation of the business. . . . Thus, applying McDonnell Douglas to reasonable accommodation cases would be superfluous, since there is no need to prove discriminatory motivation.") (emphasis in original); see also Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (in an ADA failure to accommodate case, there are no additional burdens on defendant to show that it had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff or on plaintiff to establish that defendant's proffered reasons were pretextual); Jones v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, No. 1:07-cv-1228, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22142, 2008 WL 779326, *6 (N.D.Ga. March 18, 2008) (Vining, J.) ("The Eleventh Circuit came to the logical conclusion that the McDonnell Douglas test does not apply to reasonable accommodation [*30]  claims in [Nadler], but it inexplicably did not publish the opinion and provide trial courts with a clear answer to this previously unaddressed issue.").
2. Disability Discrimination
As discussed, Plaintiff has asserted two separate counts in the Amended Complaint against Defendant under the ADA, and in both counts he alleges that Defendant discriminated against him because of his disability. In Count I, which Plaintiff titles "disability discrimination," Plaintiff alleges that, at all relevant times, he was a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA, and that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation, but Defendant terminated his employment because of his "disability, perceived disability, or record of having a disability." Am. Comp. [3] at ¶¶ 35-50. In Count II, which Plaintiff titles "failure to accommodate in violation of ADA," Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation for his disability and that refusal violated the ADA. Id. at ¶¶ 51-67. The Court will first address Plaintiff's claim in Count II that Defendant violated the ADA when it failed to provide his request for a [*31]  reasonable accommodation for his disability, and will then address Plaintiff's claim in Count I that Defendant violated the ADA when it terminated him because of his disability.
a. Failure to Accommodate
As noted above, the definition of "discriminate" under the ADA includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of that individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). In order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must generally demonstrate that he: (1) has a disability as defined in the ADA, (2) is a "qualified individual," meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, he can perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) was discriminated against because of his disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007); Rossbach v. City of Miami, 371 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (11th Cir. 2004); Witter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998).
Similarly, to prevail on a claim of disability discrimination based on an alleged failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he: (1) is disabled; (2) was a "qualified individual" when he suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) he was discriminated against because of his disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow him to keep working. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Hilburn, 181 F.3d at 1226; Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 519 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996). In addition, a plaintiff must present evidence [*32]  establishing that his employer had actual knowledge of his alleged disability or regarded him as disabled. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assoc., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910-911 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky, 80 F.3d at 447-48.
The first prima facie element requires the plaintiff to show that he has a disability as it is defined under the ADA. The relevant provision of the ADA defines "disability" as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A); see also Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268. A person may also have a "disability" under the ADA if the person has a record of such an impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment by an employer. See Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)). In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") amended the ADA in 2008 to further provide that, for the purpose of establishing the existence of a "disability," "a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B).1
The second element of the prima facie case requires the Plaintiff to establish that he is a "qualified individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA defines the term "qualified [*33]  individual" as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987); Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 278 (11th Cir. 1994).
Thus, an employee must show that he is able to meet all of a job's requirements, despite any disability, in order to establish a valid ADA claim. See Southeastern Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
"Courts consider the employer's judgment regarding whether a function is essential, as well as (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of [*34]  not requiring the individual to perform the function, (3) the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of individuals who held the job in the past, and (5) the work experience of individuals currently in similar jobs." Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 Fed. Appx. 924, 927-28 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1257-58 (11th Cir. 2007)). If a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of his job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then he is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case. See Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).
The third and final element of the Plaintiff's prima facie case requires him to present sufficient evidence to establish that he was discriminated against because of his disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007). As noted above, the ADA expressly provides that an employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer does not make "reasonable accommodations" for the employee, unless "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 Fed. Appx. 924, 927 (11th Cir. 2010) ("An employer impermissibly discriminates against a qualified individual when the employer does not reasonably accommodate the individual's disability."). A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment [*35]  to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b).
An employer is not required, however, to provide an employee with "the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F.Supp. 931, 947 (N.D.Ga. 1997)). Furthermore, although the ADA lists types of possible accommodations, the fact that a particular accommodation may be included does not mean that such accommodation is automatically deemed "reasonable" under the statute. See Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.1998). The accommodation must also be reasonable based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Id.; Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285. "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001). "In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 (internal citation and quotation omitted).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job [*36]  rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Thus, it is the plaintiff who "bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the employee desires." Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 500 Fed. App'x 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86). Moreover, an employer's "duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999) ("[T]he initial burden of requesting an accommodation is on the employee. Only after the employee has satisfied this burden and the employer fails to provide that accommodation can the employee prevail on a claim that her employer has discriminated against her."); see also Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016).
An employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify his or her limitations and possible accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). But when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's [*37]  burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id. at 1367; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 Fed. Appx. 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) ("where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In this case, for the purpose of resolving the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, the Defendant does not appear to dispute that the Plaintiff can establish that he had a disability as of September 2, 2015, when Dr. Burley diagnosed Plaintiff with "cervical spinal stenosis" and prohibited him from working in any capacity until he consulted with a neurosurgeon, which was scheduled for October of 2015. Def. SMF at ¶ 30; Pl. Dep. at 216-19, Ex. Q, R. Thus, Defendant argues, Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination based on an alleged "failure to accommodate" must be based on the Defendant's denial of a request for a permanent reduced work schedule beginning on July 27, 2015, but prior to the Plaintiff's September 2, 2015 diagnosis of cervical spinal stenosis [*38]  that rendered him unable to work. Def. Br. [38-1] at 13.
Defendant argues further that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination based on an alleged "failure to accommodate" because, at the time that Plaintiff allegedly requested an "accommodation" for his alleged disability in late July of 2015, Schneider had no knowledge that Plaintiff had an alleged disability. Instead, Defendant argues, Plaintiff informed Schneider only that he was suffering from job-related stress that caused neck and back pain, but Plaintiff never informed Schneider that he had any alleged disability prior to September 2, 2015. Id. at 14-15.
Further, Defendant argues, even if Plaintiff had put Defendant on notice that he had an alleged disability, it is also entitled to summary judgment on this claim because Plaintiff has failed to present evidence that he was a "qualified individual" who could otherwise perform the essential functions of his job. Id. at 16-19. According to Defendant, because Plaintiff could not work more than 8-10 hours per day, he was unable to perform the essential functions of his job that required being available to work up to 14 hours per day and 70 hours per eight-day [*39]  period. Finally, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because it provided Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation for his medical restrictions when it provided him with medical leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq. ("FMLA"). Id. at 19-20.
In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he "requested that Defendant accommodate his disability by allowing him to take intermittent medical leave to attend to periodic doctor's appointments," but "Defendant failed to engage in any interactive process with Plaintiff regarding his request for a reasonable accommodation of his disability." Am. Comp. at ¶¶ 59-60. In the Plaintiff's Statement of Facts, he does not contend, nor does he cite to any evidence in the record, that he ever made any specific request that Defendant "accommodate his disability by allowing him to take intermittent medical leave to attend to periodic doctor's appointments." Nevertheless, in his brief, Plaintiff contends that, "by submitting Dr. Burley's notes, [he] requested the accommodations recommended (and clarified) therein, even if it was not clear what specific ailment he suffered." Pl. Br. [44] at 9. Thus, it appears that Plaintiff is arguing that [*40]  he requested a "reasonable accommodation" for his alleged disability when he submitted notes from his doctor, Dr. Burley, regarding his work restrictions.
(1) Did Schneider Have Notice of Plaintiff's Alleged Disability?
Defendant first argues that Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on an alleged "failure to accommodate" because Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence that Defendant knew of any alleged disability. According to Defendant, at the time that Plaintiff contends that he requested an "accommodation" for his alleged disability in late July of 2015, Schneider did not know that Plaintiff had an alleged disability. Instead, Defendant argues, Plaintiff informed Schneider only that he was suffering from job-related stress that caused neck and back pain, but Plaintiff never informed Schneider that he had any significant medical condition that constituted an alleged disability prior to September 2, 2015.
The evidence cited by the parties, as set forth above, indicates that, on June 29, 2015, Plaintiff sent a message via his truck's Qualcomm system to Schneider's support center based in Green Bay, Wisconsin in which he stated that [*41]  he "was enduring a lot of stress due to the overload of assignments," but did not mention that he suffered from any other ailment. Def. SMF at ¶ 18. On July 6, 2015, Plaintiff spoke to Cassie Byers on the telephone and explained to Byers that he was suffering from job-related stress. Def. SMF at ¶ 21. On July 7, 2015, Plaintiff went to Schneider's Atlanta Operating Center, completed a request for leave, signed the form and submitted it to Schneider. Def. SMF at ¶ 22. On or around July 9, 2015, Plaintiff received a letter from Schneider informing him of his eligibility for leave under the FMLA and requesting additional medical information to support his FMLA leave request. Def. SMF at ¶ 23. Plaintiff then provided the FMLA forms to his physician Dr. Catherine Burley, and on July 23, 2015, Schneider received Plaintiff's FMLA medical certification forms completed by Dr. Burley and approved his FMLA leave request, starting on July 7, 2015 and ending on July 27, 2015. Def. SMF at ¶ 24.
It is undisputed by the parties that Plaintiff's FMLA certification, dated July 21, 2015, stated that Plaintiff was suffering from "extreme stress and fatigue due to work-related stress" which caused neck [*42]  pain, fatigue and dehydration. Def. SMF at ¶ 25; Pl. Dep. at 14-75, Ex. K. That FMLA certification also stated that Plaintiff could return to work on July 27, 2015 with the following permanent restrictions: (1) no working more than 8-9 hours per day; and (2) no working more than 45-50 hours per week. Def. SMF at ¶ 26; Pl. Dep. at 178-79, Ex. L.
On August 10, 2015, Dr. Burley completed another medical certification imposing similar permanent restrictions on Plaintiff: (1) no sitting more than 7-10 hours per day; and (2) no working more than 8-10 hours per day. Def. SMF at ¶ 27; Pl. Dep. at 195-200, Ex. M. It is undisputed that, like the July 21, 2015 certification, the August 10, 2015 certification also did not identify any specific medical condition other than job-related stress. Def. SMF at ¶ 27. When Plaintiff presented his permanent work restrictions to Schneider, Schneider informed Plaintiff that it could not excuse him from performing one of the essential functions of the Van Driver position on a permanent basis, namely being ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours per eight-day period, consistent with the schedule that Schneider required for all other [*43]  Van Drivers in McDonough. Def. SMF at ¶ 28; Nguyen Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10.
In sum, it is undisputed that, at the time the Plaintiff submitted the two FMLA certifications from Dr. Burley dated July 21, 2015, and August 10, 2015, these forms did not inform the Defendant that Plaintiff suffered from any significant physical or mental impairment other than stating that Plaintiff was suffering from work-related stress, which caused neck pain, fatigue, and dehydration. Thus, Defendant argues, because Plaintiff failed to notify Schneider that he suffered from any serious impairment that could be considered a "disability," or failed to notify Schneider that he was requesting any reasonable accommodation for an alleged "disability," the Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA because he has failed to present any evidence that the Defendant had any knowledge of any alleged "disability" at any time prior to September 2, 2015. Def. Br. at 14-15.
Defendant argues that, under the ADA, an employer's obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless it has actual knowledge of an employee's disability. Id. at 14 (citing Colclough v. Gwinnett Pub. Sch., 734 Fed. Appx. 660, 2018 WL 2175428, at *3 (11th Cir. May 11, 2018); Morisky v. Broward Cty., 80 F.3d 445, 448-49 (11th Cir. 1996) ("Vague or conclusory [*44]  statements revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations under the ADA.")).
Further, Defendant argues, the fact that Plaintiff took FMLA leave is not sufficient to establish that Schneider had actual knowledge of his disability, because the fact that an employee takes FMLA leave does not mean that the employee is disabled under the ADA. Id. at 14-15 (citing Morales v. Georgia Dep't of Human Res., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118154 2010 WL 4639279, at *8 (M.D. Ga. Nov. 8, 2010), aff'd sub nom., 446 Fed. Appx. 179 (11th Cir. 2011) ("Placing an employee on FMLA leave does not mean that an employer regards the employee as disabled for ADA purposes. 'ADA's "disability" and FMLA's "serious health condition" are different concepts, and must be analyzed separately.'") (quoting 29 C.F.R. 825.702(a)); Sneed v. Ken Edwards Enterprises, Inc., No. 1:07-CV-1088-RLV-LTW, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135287, 2009 WL 10668429, at *13-14 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 18, 2009) ("[T]he employer's mere awareness of some symptoms of an employee's alleged disability does not put the employer on notice that the employee is suffering from a disability."), report and recommendation adopted as modified, No. 1:07-CV-1088-RLV, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135187, 2009 WL 10672371 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 17, 2009) (employer's awareness that plaintiff injured his back and was "in a lot of pain" was insufficient to establish that employer had actual knowledge of disability); Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 950 (N.D. Ga. 1995) (knowledge that employee suffered from "stress" did not put employer [*45]  on sufficient notice of employee's disability)).
Thus, Defendant argues, "there can be no dispute that Schneider did not have actual knowledge of Plaintiff's disability, and thus had no obligation to provide any reasonable accommodation." Id. at 15-16 (citing Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26624, 2003 WL 21295143, at *8-9 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 24, 2003), aff'd, 82 Fed. Appx. 219 (11th Cir. 2003) ("It is not reasonable to suppose that Defendant . . . had concrete, actual knowledge of Plaintiff's disability when Plaintiff herself appeared ignorant about such status[.]"); Keeler v. Florida Dep't of Health, 324 Fed. Appx. 850, 856-57 (11th Cir. 2009) (affirming dismissal of plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim when employer did not have sufficient knowledge of plaintiff's alleged disability); Franklin v. Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI), 875 F. Supp. 2d 66, 71 (D.D.C. 2012) (post-ADAAA, "allegations of stress caused by the conduct of others at an employee's workplace will generally fail to state a claim for disability under the ADA")).
In response, the Plaintiff argues that Schneider is "simply wrong" when it contends that the ADA requires that an employee show that his employer had "actual knowledge" of his disability in order to trigger the requirement for the employer to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability. Pl. Br. [44] at 6. Plaintiff argues that the Defendant's cited cases are from outside the Eleventh Circuit, unpublished, or otherwise distinguishable, [*46]  and that Plaintiff's submission of his medical certifications from his doctor were "sufficient to trigger an employer's obligation to engage in the interactive process to determine whether a reasonable accommodation can be made." Id. at 6-7.
In Colclough v. Gwinnett Pub. Sch., 734 Fed. Appx. 660, 663 (11th Cir. 2018), one of the unpublished cases cited by Defendant, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the employer because it found that the plaintiff, who had cancer, failed to present any evidence indicating that his supervisor, or any other decisionmaker, knew about his cancer. Colclough, 734 Fed. Appx. at 663. The plaintiff in that case admitted that he did not inform his employer of his cancer diagnosis and he also did not present any evidence suggesting that the employer's decisionmakers had—or even should have had—notice of his cancer. Id. Significantly, the plaintiff did not request any specific accommodation but contended that his employer should have noticed that he requested numerous days off, derived from this that he needed an accommodation, and approached him to ask how it could help. Id. In affirming the grant of summary judgment to the employer, the Eleventh Circuit held that, because the employer was not aware "or reasonably on notice" of the plaintiff's [*47]  cancer, the employer had no legal duty to approach the plaintiff on its own accord and ask whether he needed an accommodation. Id. at 664.
In Keeler v. Florida Dep't of Health, 324 Fed. Appx. 850, 856-57 (11th Cir. 2009), another unpublished case cited by Defendant, the Eleventh Circuit also affirmed the district court's granting summary judgment to the employer because the plaintiff had failed to present any evidence indicating that her employer was aware of any medical impairment she had at the time it denied her request for a transfer. Keeler, 324 Fed. Appx. at 856. The plaintiff had testified that "nobody knew" of her disabilities when she requested a transfer to another position, and she admitted that she did not disclose her disabilities to her supervisors until after that position had been filled. Id. at 856-57. Although the plaintiff contended that the employer "should have known of her limitations" because she took lots of notes, cried while speaking to her supervisor about the transfer, and advised him that her position "was stressful and overwhelming," the Court held that this behavior was not sufficient to put the employer on notice that the plaintiff was disabled because "it in no way suggested that [the plaintiff] was substantially limited in any major life activity." Id. at 857. As a result, the employer [*48]  could not be liable under the ADA for any failure to accommodate an alleged disability. Id.
In this case, Plaintiff argues that, although he did not actually inform Schneider expressly that he had a "disability," his FMLA certifications from Dr. Burley should have been sufficient to put Schneider on notice that he had a disability and that he was requesting a reasonable accommodation for that disability. See Pl. Br. [44] at 7 ("the submitting of a physician's medical certifications setting out work restrictions, are sufficient to trigger an employer's obligation to engage in the interactive process to determine whether a reasonable accommodation can be made"). In support of that contention, Plaintiff cites to two district court cases from other districts, Quitto v. Bay Colony Golf Club, Inc., No. 206CV-286-FTM-29DNF, 580 F. Supp. 2d 911 2007 WL 2002537, at *9 (M.D. Fla. July 5, 2007) (unpublished), and Anderson v. Ga-Pacific Wood Prods., LLC, 942 F.Supp.2d 1195, 1206 n.9 (M.D. Ala. 2013). While neither case is binding on this Court, the Court finds that both cases are distinguishable from the facts of this case and do not support the Plaintiff's argument that the mere act of submitting a doctor's note can serve to put an employer on notice that an employee has a disability and is requesting a reasonable accommodation for a disability. [*49] 
In Quitto, the plaintiff, who was a sous-chef at a Golf Club restaurant, suffered an injury while at work, and returned to work using a cane to assist with walking. Quitto, 580 F. Supp. 2d 911, 2007 WL 2002537, at *1. His supervisor asked him what happened, and he responded that he had tripped on a mat and re-injured an old hip injury that resulted in hip replacement surgery a few years before. 580 F. Supp. 2d 911, [WL] at 1-2. The supervisor instructed him to go home and see a doctor as he believed that it was unsafe for the plaintiff to remain in the kitchen with a cane. 580 F. Supp. 2d 911, [WL] at 2. After seeing a doctor, the plaintiff was diagnosed with advanced osteoarthritis, which would require a knee replacement, and was also informed that he would need hip surgery and would be out of work for twelve weeks, and his employer granted him FMLA leave. Id. Approximately three months after his injury, the plaintiff faxed his employer a note from his doctor that stated that he "may return to work—light duty," and the employer contacted the doctor for more information about what "light duty" meant. Id. When the doctor responded that the plaintiff could not lift more than ten pounds and could not perform a job that required "walking or standing to a significant degree," the employer ultimately [*50]  terminated the plaintiff's employment at the end of his FMLA leave, on the ground that he could not perform the essential functions of the position. Id.
The plaintiff sued his employer for violations of the ADA and FMLA, among other claims. Id. In addressing his claim under the ADA, the court found that the plaintiff had only a temporary limitation on his ability to walk, and thus, was not disabled under the ADA, but that the plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence that the employer "regarded" the plaintiff as disabled under the ADA, which satisfied an alternative definition of "disabled" under the ADA. Id. at 8. The court stated that "the record contains sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that [the employer] perceived Quitto as being disabled. Both [the supervisor] and [the HR director] testified that they believed Quitto could not perform his job. Furthermore, Thirion, the general manager of Bay Colony, stated that an attempt should be made to accommodate Quitto, which a reasonable jury could find to mean that he regarded Quitto as disabled." Id. at 9. The court further stated that the plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence that he had requested an accommodation [*51]  by faxing his doctor's note to his employer and then referring his employer to contact to his doctor for any follow up questions, and that finding was "further supported" by the general manager's statement to the HR director to "try to and accommodate [Quitto]." Id. at 10.
In the second case cited by Plaintiff, Anderson, the plaintiff worked at a mill around dust and fumes, but suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("COPD"), and his physician submitted an FMLA certification for the plaintiff stating that he would require periodic treatment for his COPD. Anderson, 942 F.Supp.2d at 1198. Ultimately, the employer asked the plaintiff for a new FMLA certification form, and he submitted a form in which his physician stated that his lung disease permanently restricted him from working in conditions of extreme temperatures and humidity and from exposure to wood dust, fumes, gases, or chemicals, and that he would require the protection of a respirator as an accommodation of his permanent physical restrictions if he was working in areas with exposure to dust and fumes. Id. at 1201. After several discussions and meetings with the plaintiff, the employer determined that there were no positions at the mill the plaintiff could perform [*52]  with the doctor's restrictions and advised him that his employment would be terminated. Id. at 1202-03.
The plaintiff in Anderson sued his employer for violations of the ADA, among other claims. Id. at 1198. In addressing the plaintiff's claim under the ADA based on the employer's alleged failure to accommodate his disability, the court noted that the parties did not dispute that the plaintiff was disabled. See id. at 1205. The employer did not argue that it had no knowledge of his disability, as that also appeared to be undisputed. In a footnote, however, the court noted that the employer did argue that the plaintiff never actually requested a respirator as an accommodation for his lung condition, reasoning that the need for a respirator was only mentioned by his physician on the form that the physician sent directly to the employer. Id. at 1206 n.9. The court stated that it was "unconvinced by this argument," because the Eleventh Circuit has held that the request for an accommodation need not be made directly by the employee, but can be made by a representative. Id. (citing Warren v. Volusia Cnty., Fl., 188 Fed. Appx. 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2006) (dismissing case when plaintiff never requested any accommodation, either on her own or through a representative)).
In sum, the Court finds that the two cases [*53]  cited by Plaintiff, Quitto and Anderson, do not support his argument that "the submitting of a physician's medical certifications setting out work restrictions" should be "sufficient to trigger an employer's obligation to engage in the interactive process to determine whether a reasonable accommodation can be made," in the absence of any evidence that the employer was aware that the employee had a physical or mental impairment that could be considered a "disability" under the ADA. See Pl. Br. at 7. Instead, the issues presented in both Quitto and Anderson were whether a plaintiff could request a reasonable accommodation, through a note from a physician, for a disability that was otherwise known to the employer. In Quitto, the court ultimately found that the plaintiff did not have a disability, but his employer regarded him as having a disability, which the Plaintiff in this case does not argue. In Anderson, the employer never disputed that it had actual knowledge of the plaintiff's disability. Thus, neither case supports the Plaintiff's argument that, merely by submitting a physician's note in support of his request for FMLA leave to address job-related stress, he put Schneider on [*54]  notice that he had a disability and was requesting a reasonable accommodation for his disability.
As Defendant argues, merely because an employee is suffering from stress, particularly job-related stress, even if he has work-related limitations from that stress, does not constitute a disability under the ADA. See Gonzagowski v. Widnall, 115 F.3d 744, 746-47 (10th Cir. 1997) ("An impairment [limited to and arising from stress at work] does not qualify as a disability."); see also Belton v. Snyder, 249 F. Supp. 3d 14, 25 (D.D.C. 2017) (an employee who contends that he suffers from anxiety and depression as a result of job-related stress "is not a sufficient ground to establish a disability under the ADA") (citing Adams v. Alderson, 723 F.Supp. 1531, 1531 (D.D.C. 1989) (the plaintiff's condition related to a reaction to stress was not substantial for purposes of the ADA); Franklin v. Pepco Holdings, Inc., 875 F.Supp.2d 66, 71 (D.D.C. 2012) ("[A]llegations of stress caused by the conduct of others at an employee's workplace will generally fail to state a claim for disability under the ADA, because workplace-specific stress does not affect an employee's ability to perform 'either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.'" (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (EEOC regulation discussing "disability" under the ADA)); Coleman-Adebayo v. Leavitt, 326 F.Supp.2d 132, 141 n.6 (D.D.C. 2004) ("An impairment limited to and arising from stress at work does not qualify as a disability.") (citations and alterations [*55]  omitted))).
That Plaintiff's physician submitted a note to Schneider that included restrictions on Plaintiff's working more than eight hours a day was also not sufficient to put Schneider on notice that the Plaintiff had a physical or mental impairment that constituted a disability under the ADA. As discussed, Dr. Burley submitted two FMLA certifications for Plaintiff, one dated July 21, 2015 and one dated August 10, 2015, and those certifications stated that Plaintiff suffered from "extreme stress" and could not work more than 8-10 hours per day. See Def. SMF at ¶¶ 26-27. Numerous courts have held, however, that an inability to work more than eight hours a day does not constitute a disability under the ADA because an employee is not "substantially limited" in "one or more major life activities" if the employee is capable of working a typical forty-hour work week. See, e.g., Boitnott v. Corning Inc., 669 F.3d 172, 175 (4th Cir. 2012); Bialko v. Quaker Oats Co., 434 Fed. Appx. 139, 142 (3d Cir. 2011); Cotter v. Ajilon Servs., Inc., 287 F.3d 593, 598-99 (6th Cir. 2002); Miller v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., No. 01-21318, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 29424, 2002 WL 31415083, at *5 (5th Cir. 2002); Kellogg v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 233 F.3d 1083, 1087-88 (8th Cir. 2000); Taylor v. Nimock's Oil Co., 214 F.3d 957, 960-61 (8th Cir. 2000); Tardie v. Rehab. Hosp. of Rhode Island, 168 F.3d 538, 542 (1st Cir. 1999); Berg v. Norand Corp., 169 F.3d 1140, 1145 (8th Cir.1999); see also Parkinson v. Anne Arundel Med. Ctr., 214 F.Supp.2d 511, 514-15 (D.Md. 2002) ("[C]ourts have uniformly held that 'an inability to work overtime is not a substantial limitation on the ability to work.'").
Plaintiff argues in his brief that Defendant is "simply wrong" when it argues that, in the absence of "actual knowledge" of his disability, it had no obligation [*56]  to provide him with a reasonable accommodation for his alleged disability. Pl. Br. at 6. Contrary to Plaintiff's argument, the Eleventh Circuit, in a published opinion, has held that an employee must show that the employer has actual knowledge of an employee's disability in order for the employer to be held liable for discrimination against the employee because of the disability, and even constructive knowledge of the disability would not be sufficient. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1185 (11th Cir. 2005) ("In granting summary judgment in favor of Dillard's, the district court correctly disregarded these references to 'constructive knowledge' as dicta. Once the issue is framed clearly, it is evident that an employee cannot be fired 'because of' a disability unless the decisionmaker has actual knowledge of the disability.") (emphasis in original).
The Court in Cordoba stated that it is a matter of common sense and logic that an employer cannot discriminate against an employee because of a disability when the employer does not know about the disability. "As a matter of logic, Groo could not have fired Cordoba "because of" a disability that she knew nothing about. This is why we have said that "'[d]iscrimination is about actual knowledge, [*57]  and real intent, not constructive knowledge and assumed intent.'" Id. at 1183 (quoting Silvera v. Orange County Sch. Bd., 244 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir. 2001)); see also Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 800 (11th Cir. 2000).
Thus, when an employee contends that he was discriminated against because of his disability, regardless of whether he alleges that his employer terminated him because of his disability or failed to accommodate his disability, the employee must present evidence that the employer had actual knowledge of the disability in order to hold the employer liable for a violation of the ADA. Plaintiff in this case has failed to do so. While he argues that the FMLA certifications from Dr. Burley should have been sufficient to put Schneider on notice of his alleged disability, those certifications did not inform Schneider that Plaintiff had any mental or physical impairment, nor did they inform Schneider that Plaintiff was substantially limited in a major life activity. Instead, the certifications stated only that Plaintiff suffered from job-related stress and was limited to working 8-10 hours a day, but neither of those statements constituted notice to Schneider that Plaintiff had a disability.
Accordingly, the Court finds that, even assuming that Plaintiff had a disability in July or August of 2015 (although [*58]  the evidence shows that he was not actually diagnosed with a specific medical condition until September 2, 2015), the undisputed evidence reflects that the Defendant did not have any knowledge of any alleged disability when the Plaintiff submitted his FMLA certifications from Dr. Burley on July 21, 2015, and August 10, 2015. Thus, the Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on a failure to accommodate because he has failed to present evidence that Defendant knew about his alleged disability at the time that it denied his alleged request for an accommodation. For that reason, the undersigned finds that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim of failure to accommodate in Count II of the Amended Complaint.
(2) Was Plaintiff a "Qualified Individual"?
Defendant argues further that, even if it had knowledge of Plaintiff's alleged disability at the time he submitted his FMLA certifications from his doctor, his ADA claim based on a failure to accommodate would still fail because he has failed to present evidence that he was a "qualified individual" who was able to perform the essential functions of his position. Defendant [*59]  contends that the essential functions of the Plaintiff's position included a requirement that all Van Drivers in the McDonough, Georgia hub to be ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours in an eight-day period.
As discussed above, the second element of the prima facie case requires the Plaintiff to establish that he is a "qualified individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The Eleventh Circuit follows a two-step approach to determining when a disabled person is otherwise qualified. Reed v. Heil Co., 206 F.3d 1055, 1062 (11th Cir. 2000). First, the court determines whether the person has the requisite qualifications for the positions, such as sufficient experience and skills, education, and any appropriate licenses. Id. Second, the court assesses whether the person can perform the essential functions of the job in question, either with or without a reasonable accommodation. Id.; see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987). Defendant in this case does not dispute that Plaintiff had the requisite qualifications for the position, but it argues that Plaintiff cannot perform the essential functions of the job in question, either with or without a reasonable accommodation. Def. Br. at 16-19.
Essential functions are the fundamental job duties of the employment position and do [*60]  not include marginal functions. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); see also Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2001). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes: (1) the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential; (2) written job descriptions; (3) the amount of time spent performing the particular function; and (4) the consequences of not requiring the job holder to perform the function. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000).
In determining what functions of a given job are deemed to be essential, "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment . . . and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. The regulations also state three factors that make it more likely that a specific duty is an essential function of the job: (1) the reason the position exists is to perform the function; (2) there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of the job function can be distributed; and (3) the function is highly specialized so that the person holding the position was hired for his or her ability to perform the particular [*61]  function. See Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1526 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i)-(iii)).
Thus, the Court must accord substantial weight to Defendant's job description of the essential duties of the position. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir. 2007). The Court is not required to accept all functions in the job description, however, because it must weigh the Defendant's job description against all other relevant factors, including the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; the consequences of not requiring the employee to perform the function; the terms of any collective bargaining agreement; the work experience of past employees in the job; and the current work experience of employees in similar jobs. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)(ii)-(vii).
It is not enough for an employer to merely label a function essential; the employer must instead actually require employees in the position at issue to perform those functions that the employer claims are essential to the position. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n). If a plaintiff cannot perform the essential functions of the position without a reasonable accommodation, he must make a prima facie showing that a reasonable accommodation is possible, and that such an accommodation would enable him to perform those essential functions. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56; Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 281 (11th Cir. 1994). If a plaintiff is able to meet this burden, the [*62]  defendant must produce evidence of an affirmative defense that the accommodation requested is unreasonable or that it would cause an undue hardship on the employer. See Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827, 831 (3d Cir. 1996). The plaintiff, however, retains the burden at all times of identifying a reasonable accommodation that is available and demonstrating that the accommodation would allow him to perform the essential functions of the job. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56; Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1527; Moses v. Am. Nonwovens, Inc., 97 F.3d 446, 447 (11th Cir. 1996).
Determining what is reasonable for each individual employer is a highly fact-specific inquiry that will vary depending on the circumstances and necessities of each employment situation. See Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1527. The regulations provide that an employer may restructure a job by reallocating or redistributing nonessential, marginal job functions, but is not required to reallocate essential functions. The essential functions are by definition those that the individual who holds the job would have to perform, with or without accommodation, in order to be considered qualified for the position. See 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(n); Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1527; Milton v. Scrivner, Inc., 53 F.3d 1118, 1124 (10th Cir. 1995) (an employer is not required to reallocate job duties in order to change the essential functions of a job); Larkins v. CIBA Vision Corp., 858 F. Supp. 1572, 1583 (N.D. Ga. 1994) (a reasonable accommodation does not require an employer to eliminate the essential functions of a position). [*63]  Thus, if the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the position with reasonable accommodations, the employer has no duty to eliminate the essential functions of the position or to hire someone else who can perform those functions for the employee.
In this case, Defendant argues that Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of his job. Defendant contends that, to meet Home Depot's needs and demands, it requires Van Drivers in the McDonough, Georgia hub to be ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours per eight-day period. Def. Br. at 17; Def. SMF at ¶ 7. According to Defendant, these are essential job requirements designed to provide both Schneider and the drivers with maximum scheduling flexibility while ensuring full compliance with DOT Regulations. Def. SMF at ¶ 7; Burzinski Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. B ("Essential Job Functions Analysis" form stating that the position of "Van Driver (Basic)" for Schneider National requires 11 hours of driving and 14 consecutive hours "on-duty," with 10 hours "off-duty"))); Nguyen Decl. ¶ 6.
It is undisputed that the volume of freight that needed to be delivered for the Home Depot account by Van Drivers [*64]  based in the McDonough, Georgia hub fluctuated greatly from month-to-month. Def. SMF at ¶ 10. Defendant contends that, during the relevant time period, only 15 to 20 Van Drivers worked on the Home Depot account in McDonough, Georgia, thus Schneider needed all drivers in McDonough to be available to work the maximum hours allowed under the DOT Regulations in order to meet the needs of Home Depot. Def. SMF at ¶ 11. Defendant also contends that, as a Van Driver on the Home Depot account based in McDonough, Georgia, Plaintiff worked at least 55-60 hours per week most of the time, and it is undisputed that drivers on the Home Depot account typically averaged twelve hours per day. Def. SMF at ¶ 12; Pl. SMF at ¶ 33.
Thus, Defendant argues, because Plaintiff was unable to work more than 8-10 hours a day, according to the restrictions from his doctor, he was not a "qualified individual" under the ADA because he could not perform the essential functions of his position as a Van Driver. Def. Br. at 18 (citing Spears v. Creel, 607 Fed. Appx. 943, 949 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that plaintiff's request for a modified work schedule was not reasonable because it "would have caused uncertainty in scheduling, caused other officers to be held over from previous [*65]  shifts or called into work on their days off, and increased the amount of overtime others worked")).
Defendant argues further that courts have "routinely" granted summary judgment for employers when employee truck drivers cannot work up to 14 hours a day because of "the unique nature and demands of the trucking industry." Id. at 18-19 (citing Faidley v. United Parcel Serv. of Am., Inc., 889 F.3d 933, 940-41 (8th Cir. 2018) (plaintiff's request to work no more than eight hours per day was not reasonable because working overtime was an essential job function for UPS drivers who face unpredictable and fluctuating workloads as well as unpredictable weather conditions); Manigan v. Sw. Ohio Reg'l Transit Auth., 385 Fed. Appx. 472, 478 (6th Cir. 2010) (plaintiff was not qualified to work as a bus driver due to his eight-hour per day driving restriction because "the hours of driving changed every time he was assigned a new route," thus "the ability to drive more than eight hours when the route requires is an essential function of the position"); Nance v. Quickrete Co., No. 4:06CV00058, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40872, 2007 WL 1655154, at *4 (W.D. Va. June 5, 2007) (plaintiff was not qualified to work as a truck driver because he could only work up to eleven hours per day instead of the required 14 hours per day consistent with DOT Hours of Service Regulations)).
Defendant further contends that, during the time period in which Nguyen served [*66]  as the Account Service Manager for the Home Depot account from April of 2014 to January of 2018, no Van Driver in the McDonough, Georgia hub was excused, on a regular or permanent basis, from the requirement of being ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours in an eight-day period. Def. SMF at ¶ 8; Nguyen Decl. ¶¶ 2, 6. While Plaintiff does not actually dispute Defendant's contention in his response to Defendant's Statement of Facts by citing to record evidence (which, under the Local Rules, deems that fact "admitted"), in his own Statement of Facts, he contends that there were Van Drivers who were excused "on a regular or permanent basis, from the requirement of being ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours in an eight-day period." Pl. SMF at ¶ 40; Pl. Decl. ¶ 7. Significantly, however, Plaintiff has failed to identify even one Van Driver who he claims was excused from the requirements "on a regular or permanent basis." Further, Defendant objects to Plaintiff's contention on the basis that Plaintiff has failed to provide any foundation to establish his "personal knowledge" of that fact, Plaintiff has admitted that he does not [*67]  have knowledge of other driver's work schedules, and he has admitted that he cannot name even one driver who was excused from that requirement. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 40; Pl. Dep. at 111-16.
Plaintiff also contends that "he was aware of at least two people who worked fewer than 11 hours per day and who may have been employed part time," although he again fails to identify either of those individuals. Pl. SMF at ¶ 41; Pl. Decl. ¶ 8. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to identify even one person, let alone one Van Driver in the McDonough hub, who worked fewer than 11 hours per day or who was employed part-time by Schneider. Defendant objects to Plaintiff's contention on the basis that Plaintiff has failed to provide any foundation to establish his "personal knowledge" of that fact, Plaintiff has admitted that he does not have knowledge of other driver's work schedules, and he has admitted that he cannot name even one driver who was excused from the "essential job requirement of being ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours in an eight-day period." Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 41; Pl. Dep. at 111-16.
The Court sustains the Defendant's objection on the ground that the Plaintiff [*68]  has failed to provide any foundation for how he would have personal non-hearsay knowledge of another Van Driver's schedule. Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that "[a]n affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4); see also Fed. R. Evid. 602 ("A witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.").
"Personal knowledge" refers to what a witness directly observes or perceives, and generally does not include what a witness may have learned from hearsay statements from other people or in documents. See U.S. v. Evans, 484 F.2d 1178, 1181 (2nd Cir. 1973) (a matter is within a witness's personal knowledge when it is "derived from the exercise of his own senses, not from the reports of others—in other words, [it] must be founded on personal observation" (quoting 2 Wigmore, Evidence, 3d ed. 1940, § 657)); Revis v. T&A Farms, No. 5:14-CV-88, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85036, 2017 WL 2415915, at *2 n.1 (S.D. Ga. June 2, 2017) (a witness does not have "personal knowledge" of a fact because she saw a document that allegedly included a statement by an unknown person attesting to that fact); [*69]  see also Fed. R. Evid. 801 ("'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted."); Macuba v. DeBoer, 193 F.3d 1316, 1322-23 (11th Cir. 1999) ("The general rule is that inadmissible hearsay 'cannot be considered on a motion for summary judgment.'") (quoting Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1990)).
Because Plaintiff has not provided any foundation for how he would be able to offer admissible testimony as to another Van Driver's work schedule, it appears that Plaintiff's statement that there were other Van Drivers who were excused "on a regular or permanent basis, from the requirement of being ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours in an eight-day period," may be based on hearsay or mere speculation. "'Speculation does not create a genuine issue of fact.'" Howard v. Oregon Television, Inc., 276 Fed. Appx. 940, 941 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1181 (11th Cir. 2005)); see also Shuler v. Ingram & Assoc., 441 Fed. Appx. 712, 715 (11th Cir. 2011) ("Speculation or conjecture cannot create a genuine issue of material fact.") (quoting Cordoba, 419 F.3d at 1181).
While Plaintiff attests in a conclusory fashion that he "is aware" of these facts, he supplies no factual basis for the Court to find that Plaintiff has the requisite personal knowledge or is otherwise competent to testify as to these matters. Accordingly, the Court may not consider these statements. [*70]  See Jefferson v. Sewon Am., Inc., 891 F.3d 911, 925 (11th Cir. 2018) (affirming district court's exclusion of portion of affidavit at summary judgment because the affiant "did not provide any facts from which to conclude that [the witness] had personal knowledge about the reasons for [the plaintiff's] termination").
Thus, the Court finds that the Defendant has presented sufficient evidence to establish that an essential function of the job for Van Drivers in the McDonough, Georgia hub was that they were required to be ready and available to work up to 14 hours per day and up to 70 hours per eight-day period, and Plaintiff has failed to present evidence to dispute this fact, by showing that any driver was not actually subject to this requirement, or through any other evidence. Generally, it is unreasonable to require an employer to permanently excuse an employee from performing aspects of the job, redefine the job to exclude the functions he cannot perform, or reassign those tasks to other employees. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1260 (11th Cir. 2001) ("[E]mployers are not required to transform the position into another one by eliminating functions that are essential to the nature of the job as it exists."); Ammons v. Aramark Uniform Servs., Inc., 368 F.3d 809, 819 (7th Cir. 2004) (employer need not alter employee's job such that he would be performing functions he [*71]  could do, omitting other essential functions."). More specifically, employers are not required to modify an employee's existing medium or heavy-duty position into exclusively light-duty work because of a physical restriction. See, e.g., Richardson v. Friendly Ice Cream, 594 F.3d 69, 80-81 (1st Cir. 2010) (employer need not excuse a restaurant manager from necessary lifting on the basis of a shoulder injury and lifting restrictions); Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, 174 F.3d 615, 620-21 (5th Cir. 1999).
In sum, the Court finds that, even assuming that Plaintiff had a disability and that Defendant had actual knowledge of the disability (which, as discussed above, it did not), the Plaintiff has also failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on his failure-to-accommodate claim because he has failed to present sufficient evidence that he was an otherwise "qualified individual" who could perform all of the essential functions of the position, with or without a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Count II of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the ADA based on Defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability, and RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary [*72]  Judgment [38] be GRANTED as to Count II.
b. Termination
In Count I of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim against Defendant under the ADA for "disability discrimination." Am. Comp. [3] at ¶¶ 35-50. Plaintiff alleges that, at all relevant times, he was a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA, and that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation, but the Defendant terminated his employment because of his "disability, perceived disability, or record of having a disability." Id. at ¶¶ 42-44.
As discussed above, in order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he: (1) has a disability as defined in the ADA, (2) is a "qualified individual," meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, he can perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) was discriminated against because of his disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007); Witter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). In addition, a plaintiff must present evidence establishing that his employer had actual knowledge of his alleged disability or regarded him as disabled. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assoc., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910-911 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward County, 80 F.3d 445, 447-48 (11th Cir. 1996).
The Defendant does not dispute that, as of September 2, 2015, the [*73]  Plaintiff had an alleged disability. It is undisputed that, on September 2, 2015, Dr. Burley diagnosed Plaintiff with "cervical spinal stenosis" and issued new restrictions, prohibiting him from working in any capacity until he consulted with a neurosurgeon, which was scheduled for October of 2015. Def. SMF at ¶ 30. Defendant argues that Plaintiff has nevertheless failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on his termination because he cannot show that he was a "qualified individual" who could perform the essential functions of his job, with or without a reasonable accommodation. Def. Br. at 22-23. Indeed, Defendant argues, the undisputed evidence shows that, at the time that it terminated the Plaintiff's employment on November 23, 2015, the Plaintiff was unable to perform the job at all.
The relevant facts surrounding Plaintiff's termination are set forth above. In sum, the undisputed evidence shows that Schneider granted Plaintiff FMLA leave starting on July 7, 2015, and originally ending on July 27, 2015, and it was later extended through September 27, 2015. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 24, 32. Plaintiff contends that, on August 12, 2015, while he was still on FMLA [*74]  leave, he was administered a "DOT physical" at Concentra Medical Centers of Georgia and the result was "able to perform essential functions" and "no medical restrictions." Pl. SMF at ¶ 18; Burzinski Dep., Ex. 10. Defendant notes, however, that Plaintiff himself admits that he did not believe he could return to work at that time. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 18; Pl. Dep. 205-08 (Plaintiff testified that he "did not believe" that he could return to work with no restrictions and, as of August 12, 2015, Dr. Burley had not released him to return to work).
On September 2, 2015, Dr. Burley diagnosed Plaintiff with "cervical spinal stenosis" and issued new restrictions, prohibiting him from working in any capacity. Def. SMF at ¶ 30. After Schneider extended the Plaintiff's FMLA leave, Plaintiff eventually exhausted his available FMLA leave on September 27, 2015, but Schneider allowed Plaintiff to remain on medical leave. Def. SMF at ¶ 32. On or around October 13, 2015, Plaintiff's new physician, Dr. Paul King, diagnosed Plaintiff with a herniated disc and recommended surgery. Def. SMF at ¶ 33. On October 19, 2015, Schneider received a letter from Dr. Burley informing Schneider of Dr. King's diagnosis [*75]  and Plaintiff's need for surgery to remedy the herniated disc, but Dr. Burley's letter did not provide any additional information, such as the expected date of Plaintiff's surgery or whether he would be able to return to work after his surgery. Def. SMF at ¶ 34.
It is undisputed that on October 20, 2015 and November 5, 2015, Burzinski sent letters to Plaintiff advising him that Schneider needed additional medical information in order to assess whether it could provide a reasonable accommodation for his medical condition. Def. SMF at ¶ 36. It is further undisputed that Plaintiff received Burzinski's letters sent on October 20, 2015 and November 5, 2015, but he never contacted anyone at Schneider to respond to the letters. Def. SMF at ¶ 37; Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 37. After receiving Dr. Burley's October 19, 2015 letter, Schneider did not receive any further information from Plaintiff or his health care providers about his medical condition. Def. SMF at ¶ 42. While Plaintiff does not dispute this, he contends that he "provided the letters to either Dr. Burley or Dr. King and asked that she or he respond on his behalf." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 42; Pl. Decl. ¶ 21. Plaintiff has presented no evidence, [*76]  however, that either physician ever responded to Schneider's requests for information about his condition.
On November 16, 2015, Schneider sent a final reminder letter to Plaintiff stating that Schneider needed to hear from him as soon as possible so it could determine whether he intended to return to work, and informing him that, if Schneider did not hear from Plaintiff by November 20, 2015, it would assume that Plaintiff did not intend on returning to work and would treat his absence as a voluntary resignation. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 44-45. It is undisputed that Plaintiff never contacted Schneider after receiving the letter. Def. SMF at ¶ 46. On November 23, 2015, Schneider terminated Plaintiff's employment. Def. SMF at ¶ 47.
According to Defendant, Schneider terminated Plaintiff's employment for job abandonment. Def. SMF at ¶ 47. Plaintiff contends that Schneider terminated his employment "because of his disability." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 47; Pl. SMF at ¶ 60; Pl. Decl. ¶ 27. While Plaintiff contends that his employment was terminated "because of his disability," he has not presented any evidence to dispute the Defendant's contention that he failed to show up for work between July 7, 2015, and [*77]  November 23, 2015, a period lasting over four months, and, although he was repeatedly asked for information about his medical condition or an expected date of return, he failed to give Defendant any information or any proposed date on which he expected to be able to return to work.
Plaintiff makes much of the fact that Defendant's final letter to him, dated November 16, 2015, was sent to Plaintiff's home address rather than a P.O. Box, and that Schneider did not send the letter by certified mail with return receipt requested. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 63-64. But Plaintiff does not dispute that he had already received the two previous letters dated October 20, 2015 and November 5, 2015, advising him that Schneider needed additional medical information in order to assess whether it could provide a reasonable accommodation for his medical condition, nor does Plaintiff dispute the fact that he never responded to Schneider's repeated requests for information about his condition or his expected date of return to work.
Defendant contends that Plaintiff has been completely unable to work in any capacity, with or without reasonable accommodation, since Dr. Burley diagnosed him with "cervical spinal stenosis" [*78]  and restricted him from working in any capacity starting on September 2, 2015. Def. SMF at ¶ 48; Pl. Dep. at 23-24, 36-37 (Plaintiff testified that he has not sought employment since June 1, 2015 because he is completely unable to work), 218-19, Ex. R. According to Defendant, no physician has "cleared" Plaintiff to return to work in any capacity since his September 2, 2015 diagnosis. Def. SMF at ¶ 48. Plaintiff contends only that he "has been told that he could work 'light duty.'" Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 48; Pl. SMF at ¶ 61; Pl. Decl. ¶ 28. Significantly, however, Plaintiff has presented no evidence that he ever submitted any information to Schneider after September 2, 2015, that his physician had cleared him to work at all, or that he ever gave Schneider any proposed date on which he planned to return to work.
Thus, it is undisputed that, on September 2, 2015, Dr. Burley issued a restriction prohibiting the Plaintiff from working in any capacity, and then on October 19, 2015, Dr. Burley further informed Schneider that Plaintiff needed surgery to remedy a herniated disc, but Dr. Burley's letter did not provide any information regarding whether Plaintiff would be able to return to work after [*79]  his surgery. For this reason, the only information that Schneider had at the time of the Plaintiff's termination was that he was completely unable to work in any capacity, and Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to dispute that.
As discussed, if a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of his job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then he is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA. See Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000). It is well-settled law in the Eleventh Circuit that an individual is not an otherwise "qualified individual" for his position if he is unable to meet the attendance requirements of the job. See Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1231 (11th Cir. 1999) (citing Tyndall v. National Educ. Ctrs. Inc., 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994)); Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 279 (11th Cir. 1994) (holding under Rehabilitation Act that an employee had failed to prove that he was "an otherwise qualified individual because he had failed to satisfy the presence requirement of his job"); Allen v. GTE Mobile Communs. Serv. Corp., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3539 1997 WL 148670 (N.D. Ga. 1997) ("It is well-settled that presence at the job site is an essential function of most jobs."); Mears v. Gulfstream Aerospace, 905 F. Supp. 1075, 1080 (S.D. Ga. 1995) (employee who cannot meet the attendance requirements of the job at issue cannot be considered a qualified individual under the ADA); Stevens v. Stubbs, 576 F. Supp. 1409, 1415 (N.D. Ga. 1983) (stating that the law does not protect absenteeism because it renders an employee unable [*80]  to perform his or her job); see also Rogers v. Int'l Marine Terminals, Inc., 87 F.3d 755, 759 (5th Cir. 1996) ("Because [the plaintiff] could not attend work, he [was] not a 'qualified individual with a disability' under the ADA."); Gassaway v. BellSouth Advert. & Publ'g Corp., No. 1:03-CV-3841-BBM-ECS, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110132, 2006 WL 8431267, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 3, 2006), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:03-CV-3841-BBM, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110133 2006 WL 8431263 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 8, 2006) ("Courts in this circuit have repeatedly held that an individual is not qualified for her job if she is unable to meet the attendance requirements of the job.").
Because the undisputed evidence shows that Plaintiff was unable to work and could not perform the essential functions of his position, and he never informed Schneider of a date that he could return to work, he has failed to present evidence that he was a "qualified individual," and thus, he has failed to present a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on the termination of his employment. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Count I of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the ADA based on the termination of his employment, and RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [38] be GRANTED as to Count I.

III. RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons discussed above, [*81]  IT IS RECOMMENDED that the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [38] be GRANTED and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant on all of Plaintiff's claims.
As this is a Final Report and Recommendation, there is nothing further in this action pending before the undersigned. Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 24th day of January, 2019.
