Opinion


FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
YOU, Magistrate Judge:
Plaintiff Nora Lee ("Lee") alleges claims against Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Northwest ("Kaiser") for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 USC §§ 12101-12213, and the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 USC §§ 2601-2654. Compl., ECF #1. Kaiser has filed a motion for summary judgment (ECF #19) seeking dismissal of both claims. For the reasons set forth below, the motion (ECF #19) should be DENIED with respect to Lee's ADA claim and GRANTED with respect to her FMLA claim.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Lee has worked as a full-time pharmacist for Kaiser since 1992. She worked at the Mt. Scott Clinical Out-Patient Pharmacy ("Mt. Scott") from 1993 until December 2016, when she transferred to Kaiser's Mt. Talbert location. Decl. of Nora Lee ¶¶ 1, 48 ("Lee Decl."), ECF #27. Mt. Scott operated long hours, seven days a week. Decl. [*2]  of Ivy Markesino ¶ 3, ("Markesino Decl."), ECF #23.
Lee suffers from major depressive disorder, sleep apnea, and an eating disorder. Lee Decl. ¶ 2. Because these conditions substantially impair one or more of her major life activities, she qualifies as a disabled individual under the ADA, 42 USC § 12111, and because they constitute serious health conditions, she is entitled to leave benefits under the FMLA. 29 USC § 2611(11).
Beginning in 2011, Lee began receiving ongoing therapeutic treatment and counseling for her medical conditions. Lee Decl. ¶ 7. Kaiser approved Lee's use of intermittent medical leave, and she took leave periodically. Id. ¶ 4; Markesino Decl. ¶¶ 9-10. In January 2013, Lee requested to work a set 40-hour Wednesday—Sunday schedule with every Monday and Tuesday off. Lee Decl. ¶ 3. She did not tell her supervisor that her need for this schedule was related to her medical conditions. Id. Nevertheless—and without asking about Lee's need for the restriction—Lee's supervisor approved her request, despite the fact that her job description required that she "demonstrate flexibility in adjusting personal schedule to complete workload as required" and "[r]otate shifts as required, including evenings, weekends, [*3]  and holidays." Markesino Decl., Ex. 1, at 3 (ECF #23-1); Lee Decl. ¶ 3. In reality, Lee had therapy and counseling appointments on Mondays and Tuesdays that could not be rescheduled, and she needed time off to attend these appointments and to rest. Lee Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.
In July 2014, Kaiser began taking steps to address underperformance at Mt. Scott. Markesino Decl. ¶¶ 4-8; Supp. Decl. of Linh Chau ¶ 9 ("Suppl. Chau Decl."), ECF #37. By September 2014, Kaiser had introduced a new pharmacy software system and brought in a new interim manager, Fadi Chehab. Lee Decl. ¶ 9.
Lee continued to work a 40-hour Wednesday—Sunday schedule until January 2015. Id. ¶¶ 9-10. In December 2014, Lee noticed that Chehab had scheduled her to work January 12, 2015, which was a Monday. Id. Lee asked Chehab if he would allow her to keep the 40-hour Wednesday—Sunday schedule, but he denied her request citing "business needs." Id. On December 24, 2014, Lee revealed—for the first time—that she needed a Wednesday-Sunday schedule to address serious medical conditions. Id. ¶ 10. When Chehab refused to make an exception, Lee took the day off using FMLA leave. Id. ¶ 13.
Lee attended a meeting with Chehab and her union representative [*4]  in February 2015, where Chehab explained that Lee's FMLA certification did not say she needed every Monday off. Id. ¶¶ 12, 15. Lee revised her FMLA certification to include time off every Monday and Tuesday to attend medical appointments. Id. ¶ 16. She also added that she should be scheduled to work full-time Wednesday—Sunday. Id.
Lee began working "split shifts," i.e., before and after her appointments, when she was scheduled to work on a Monday or a Tuesday until Chehab prohibited that arrangement. Id. ¶ 17. Thereafter, Lee took a full day of sick leave whenever she was scheduled to work on a Monday or a Tuesday. Id. Thus, if her supervisor scheduled her to work on both a Monday and Tuesday, Lee would take leave on those days and would only be able to work three days that week. If her supervisor scheduled her to work Wednesday—Sunday, however, she was able to work all five days.
In March 2015, Lee contacted Kaiser's Disability Case Manager and requested a reasonable accommodation under the ADA of a 40-hour Wednesday—Sunday schedule. Id. ¶ 18. After discussions with Lee, her physician, and her new supervisor, Linh Chau, Kaiser denied Lee's request in April 2015. Decl. of Tanya Thompson [*5]  ("Thompson Decl.") ¶¶ 10-17. Thompson acknowledged that Lee would have preferred a 40-hour Wednesday—Sunday schedule, but decided that Lee's need for time away from work could "be best met by updating [her] current approved intermittent leave of absence [request.]" Id. ¶ 20. Moreover, the collective bargaining agreement between Lee's union and Kaiser required that employees use sick leave when absent for medical reasons. Suppl. Markesino Decl. ¶ 2, ECF #35. Additionally, all other pharmacists rotated through shifts seven days a week and no pharmacist was regularly scheduled on specific days of the week. Suppl. Chau Decl. ¶ 9.
On April 9, 2015, Lee's therapist, Tracy Farmer, advised Kaiser that Lee needed a "regular work schedule Wednesday [through] Sunday with Monday and Tuesday off for treatment." Decl. of Holly Lloyd ("Lloyd Decl."), Ex. 11, at 3 (ECF #26-11). Farmer emphasized that Lee "cannot function without [a] regular consistent schedule," and that "[i]rregular scheduling exacerbates [her] inability to cope with stress." Id. Again on April 14, 2015, Farmer reiterated, "It is strongly medically recommended that Nora Lee have a consistent routine weekly schedule with 2 days off [*6]  in a row to incorporate rest and recovery and to ensure stabilization from high risk psychiatric symptoms." Id., Ex. 13.
In May 2015, Lee e-mailed Thompson with another accommodation request identifying twelve ways she believed she was not being accommodated, including that she wanted to work full time, she did not want to use her sick leave unless absolutely necessary, she was being forced to use her sick leave, she was losing money in her pension that was associated with her sick bank, and FMLA only provided for 12 weeks of protected leave. Lee Decl. ¶ 22; id., Ex. 12 (ECF #27-12). A month later, Kaiser held an interactive-process meeting to figure out how to accommodate Lee's medical disabilities and considered reassigning her to the Automated Refill Center. Id. ¶ 30.
Lee took June 1, 2015, through July 4, 2015, off using vacation time because of stress and an exacerbation of her symptoms. Id. ¶ 29; Markesino Decl. ¶ 19. She provided Kaiser with additional accommodation requests, and Kaiser held three subsequent interactive-process meetings in June, July, and August 2015. Lee Decl. ¶¶ 31-32, 35, 37. On July 29, 2015, Lee's health care provider, Dr. Gretchen Hein, verified that Lee [*7]  needed a "release from work on Mondays and Tuesdays." Thompson Decl. ¶ 29 ("Thompson Decl."), ECF #22; id., Ex. 13 (ECF #22-13).
Lee was hospitalized from February 26, 2016, until March 1, 2016, for severe depression and suicidal ideation. Id. ¶ 42. For the first time during her employment with Kaiser, Lee exhausted her FMLA leave during this time. Id. ¶ 43. She received letters denying her use of FMLA leave for multiple days between February 26, 2016, through March 2, 2016. Id. However, Kaiser did not discipline Lee for these absences. Decl. of Laura Rosenbaum ("Rosenbaum Decl."), ECF #21, Ex. 1 (ECF #21-1) (Lee Dep. 65:17-66:5).
Additional interactive-process meetings were held in March, April, and May 2016, after which Kaiser temporarily granted Lee a 40-hour Wednesday—Sunday schedule. Lee Decl. ¶¶ 44, 46. In July 2016, Kaiser permanently granted Lee her requested schedule until there was a change in her medical condition or in its business needs that could no longer support the accommodation. Id. ¶ 47. In late 2016, Kaiser transferred Lee to its Mt. Talbert location so that she could maintain her schedule after it stopped offering weekend hours at Mt. Scott. Id. ¶ 48 (noting that [*8]  several meetings were held to affect this transfer).
From January 2015 through May 2016, Lee exhausted her paid and unpaid sick leave, including three separate sick banks: an "extended sick bank" with 220 hours of sick leave, an "annual sick bank" that accrues 80 hours of sick leave per year, and a "new extended sick bank" consisting of unused sick time from prior years. Id. ¶¶ 5-6. Because these sick banks were exhausted, she was ineligible for a supplemental pension contribution. Lee Decl. ¶ 6; id., Exs. 1-4 (ECF ##27-1-4). Kaiser has not disciplined or otherwise penalized Lee for her use of leave. Rosenbaum Decl., Ex. 1 (Lee Dep. 65:17-66:5, 78:22-79:4); Chau Decl. ¶ 19, ECF #20. Lee continues to be an employee in good standing and has received positive performance reviews. Lee Decl. ¶ 51.

STANDARDS
A party is entitled to summary judgment if the "movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." FRCP 56(a). The moving party has the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "When judging the evidence at the summary judgment stage, the district court is not to make credibility determinations [*9]  or weigh conflicting evidence, and is required to draw all inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Musick v. Burke, 913 F.2d 1390, 1394 (9th Cir. 1990); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) ("The evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor."). Although "[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge . . . ruling on a motion for summary judgment," the "mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position [is] insufficient . . . ." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 255. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citation and quotation marks omitted).

FINDINGS
Drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to Lee, genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on her ADA claim. However, her FMLA claim fails as a matter of law.

I. Failure to Accommodate Under the ADA (42 USC § 12112(b)(5)(A))
Because a reasonable jury could find that (1) Kaiser's accommodation did not allow Lee to enjoy the same benefits and privileges of employment as similarly situated non-disabled employees, (2) Lee's requested [*10]  accommodation would not have eliminated an essential function of her position and did not pose an undue hardship to Kaiser, and (3) Kaiser did not engage in the interactive process in good faith, Kaiser's motion for summary judgment on the ADA claim should be denied.

A. Relevant Law
The ADA declares that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability. . . ." 42 USC § 12112(a). A qualified individual is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. 42 USC § 12111(8); see also 29 CFR § 1630.2(m).
To establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate under the ADA, Lee must show that (1) she is disabled; (2) she is qualified for the job in question and capable of performing it with reasonable accommodation; (3) the employer had notice of her disability; and (4) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1237 (9th Cir. 2012).
Kaiser does not dispute that Lee has satisfied the first three elements of her prima facie case. Thus, only the last element is in dispute—whether Kaiser reasonably accommodated Lee's disability.
"Title I of the ADA insures full opportunities [*11]  for people with disabilities in the workplace by requiring reasonable accommodation of employees' disabilities by their employers." Humphrey v. Meml. Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir. 2001). An employer discriminates by failing to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." 42 USC § 12112(b)(5)(A); U.S. EEOC v. UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d 1103, 1110 (9th Cir. 2010).
"Once an employee requests an accommodation, the employer must engage in an interactive process with an employee to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation." UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d at 1110 (quoting Zivkovic v. S. California Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002)) (alterations omitted). The duties to provide a reasonable accommodation and engage in the interactive process in good faith are continuing duties that are not exhausted by a single effort. Humphrey, 239, F.3d at 1138.
Whether an accommodation is reasonable requires an individualized case-by-case assessment. Barnett v. U.S. Air, 228 F.3d 1105, 1114-15 (en banc), vacated sub nom., US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002). The "reasonableness of an accommodation is ordinarily a question of fact." UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d at 1110 (quoting Lujan v. Pac. Mar. Ass'n, 165 F.3d 738, 743 (9th Cir. 1999)). An employee, however, is entitled only to a reasonable accommodation, not the employee's preferred [*12]  accommodation. Id. at 1110-11. When more than one reasonable accommodation exists, "the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations, and may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide." Id. at 1111 (quoting 29 CFR § 1630, App. § 1630.2(n)).
Reasonable accommodation is defined in 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1) as:
(i) Modifications or adjustments to a job application process that enable a qualified applicant with a disability to be considered for the position such qualified applicant desires; or
(ii) Modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position; or
(iii) Modifications or adjustments that enable a covered entity's employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employees without disabilities.
(emphasis added).
Only the last two definitions are relevant to the discussion in this case: (1) essential functions and (2) equal benefits and privileges. "[E]ssential [*13]  functions are those functions that the individual who holds the position must be able to perform unaided or with the assistance of a reasonable accommodation." 29 CFR App. § 1630.2(n). They are the "fundamental job duties of the employment position . . . not includ[ing] the marginal functions of the position." Id. § 1630.2(n)(1); see also id. § 1630.2(n)(2)-(3) (listing reasons and evidence relevant to making an essential function showing). Moreover, an employer who disputes the plaintiff's claim that he can perform the essential functions must put forth evidence establishing those functions. Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 991 (9th Cir. 2007).
Benefits and privileges of employment include compensation, insurance, leave, fringe benefits, access to facilities, and access to social events, among other things. See 42 USC § 12112(a) (referring to "employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment"); U.S. EEOC, A Technical Assistance Manual on The Employment Provisions (Title I) of the Americans with Disabilities Act §§ 3.3, 7.1, 7.12 (1992) ("TAM"). TAM § 7.1 refers to "compensation, insurance, leave, and other benefits and privileges of employment," indicating that compensation and leave are forms of benefits and privileges. TAM § 7.12 defines "other benefits and privileges of employment" to [*14]  include things such as access to facilities and social events. However, a reasonable accommodation "does not have to ensure equal results or provide exactly the same benefits or privileges." TAM § 3.4.

B. Analysis

1. Kaiser's Accommodation: As-Needed Intermittent Leave
Kaiser argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because it reasonably accommodated Lee by allowing her to take paid and unpaid sick leave on an as-needed basis. It is undisputed that Kaiser's accommodation allowed Lee to perform the essential functions of her position. See 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii). However, Lee asserts her claim under a different provision of 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1). She contends that Kaiser's accommodation did not allow her to enjoy the equal benefits and privileges of employment enjoyed by similarly-situated non-disabled employees under 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1)(iii).
In her complaint, Lee alleges that Kaiser "violated the ADA by failing to reasonably accommodate [her] with a Wednesday through Sunday schedule which would have allowed her to work 40 hours per week and enjoy the same privileges and benefits as those employees without disabilities." Compl. ¶ 30 (emphasis added). More specifically, Lee contends that she was "forced to use her accrued sick leave for Mondays and Tuesday[s], [*15]  which resulted in economic losses including a loss of accrued sick time, loss of premium pay for Saturdays and Sundays, and loss of contributions to her Supplemental Pension Plan in the approximate amount of $64,000.00." Id. ¶ 31. She also contends that she suffered from emotional distress damages, and that because Kaiser acted "with malice or reckless indifference to [her] federally protected rights," punitive damages should be awarded. Id. ¶ 33.
It is clear that 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii), which requires modifications and adjustments to perform "essential functions," is distinct from 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1)(iii), which requires modifications and adjustments to enjoy "equal benefits and privileges," and that both provisions are equally enforceable. They are independent requirements of the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation. Otherwise stated, that a modification or adjustment satisfies one of the provisions of 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1), does not mean that the employer has satisfied its duty to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability under the other provisions.
The Ninth Circuit recognized this distinction in Buckingham v. U.S., 998 F.2d 735 (9th Cir. 1993), in which it stated:
Employers are not relieved of their duty to accommodate when employees are already able to perform the essential functions [*16]  of the job. Qualified handicapped employees who can perform all job functions may require reasonable accommodation to allow them to . . . enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment equal to those enjoyed by non-handicapped employees. . . . In other words, an employer is obligated not to interfere, either through action or inaction, with a handicapped employee's efforts to pursue a normal life.
Id. at 740 (citation omitted); see also UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d at 1111-12 (holding there was a genuine issue of fact regarding whether written materials were sufficient to enable a deaf employee to enjoy the same benefits and privileges of attending and participating in weekly meetings "even when those [benefits and privileges of employment had] no bearing on an employee's job performance").
Other courts throughout the country have held that employers have a separate duty under subsections (ii) and (iii). For example, in Merrill v. McCarthy, 184 F. Supp. 3d 221, 238 (E.D.N.C. 2016), the court held:
To be sure, an employer has a duty to provide reasonable accommodations that enable a disabled employee to perform essential job functions. 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii). But, that is not the employer's only duty. If the employee needs reasonable accommodation to enable her "to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment," the employer is obligated [*17]  to provide it as well.
Id. at 238; see also Feist v. Louisiana, Dep't of Justice, Office of the Atty. Gen., 730 F.3d 450, 453 (5th Cir. 2013) (recognizing that under 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1), a modification that enables an individual to perform the essential functions of a position is only one of three categories of reasonable accommodation); E.E.O.C. v. Life Techs. Corp., WMN-09-2569, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117563, 2010 WL 4449365, at *4 (D. Md. Nov. 4, 2010) (holding "29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1)(iii) . . . requires employers to make modifications and adjustments, not just to minimally permit disabled employees to do their job, but also to permit them to enjoy all of the 'benefits and privileges' of the job as would any other employee"); Campbell v. Wal—Mart Stores, Inc., 272 F.Supp. 2d 1276, 1291 (N.D. Okla. 2003) ("Plaintiff's contention that the purpose of a reasonable accommodation is not merely for the performance of job functions, but also to enable employees to 'enjoy the privilege and benefits of employment' is well-taken."); Kessler v. AT & T, No. 3:13-CV-00207, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126888, 2015 WL 5598866, at *12 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 22, 2015) (holding there was a "triable dispute of fact as to whether or not AT&T failed to provide Plaintiff with reasonable accommodations, notwithstanding her own testimony that she was able to" perform the essential functions of her job).
Kaiser asserts that "[t]he purpose of a reasonable accommodation is to enable an employee to perform the essential functions of a position," and that it provided Lee with such an accommodation when it allowed her to take leave [*18]  on an intermittent basis. Reply 6. Kaiser's "understanding of reasonable accommodation is inconsistent with other provisions in the [ADA]." Life Techs, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117563, 2010 WL 4449365, at *5. The ADA's "definition of a 'qualified individual with a disability' includes those who can 'perform the essential functions of the employment position' 'without reasonable accommodations.'" Id. (citing 42 USC § 12111(8)). "Implicit in that definition is the expectation that some accommodations are provided to do more than just permit the qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of the position." Id.; see also Scalera v. Electrograph Sys., Inc., 848 F. Supp. 2d 352, 366 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) ("Defendants' interpretation of the ADA is too narrow. . . . [The] requested accommodations did not necessarily have to go to essential functions of the job, as long as Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job, with or without accommodations."); Cadoret v. Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., No. 3:15CV1377 (JBA), 323 F. Supp. 3d 319, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21971, 2018 WL 806548, at *4 (D. Conn. Feb. 9, 2018) ("Despite the fact that Plaintiff concedes he can perform the essential functions of his job, there is a triable issue of fact with respect to whether Plaintiff required an ASL interpreter to access meetings and trainings in the workplace in order to receive equal benefits and privileges of employment.").
The next [*19]  question is whether sick leave accrual, premium pay, and supplemental pension contributions are, as Lee contends, "benefits and privileges" encompassed by subsection (iii). While the terms "benefits and privileges" are not expressly defined in 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1), employee compensation is recognized as a "privilege" in the language of the ADA itself. Specifically, 42 USC § 12112(a) prohibits discrimination against "a qualified individual with a disability . . . in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." (emphasis added). The ADA elsewhere states that a "reasonable accommodation" may include "modified work schedules," which is what Lee requested in this case. 42 USC § 12111(9). The TAM also refers to "compensation, insurance, leave, and other benefits and privileges of employment," thereby recognizing that compensation and leave are forms of benefits and privileges. TAM § 7.1 (emphasis added). As the court in Life Techs. noted:
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o) essentially tracks the language of the [ADA]: subsection (i) references modification and adjustments to the job application process; subsection (ii) references modifications and adjustments necessary to enable a qualified [*20]  individual to perform the essential functions of the position; and subsection (iii) references modifications and adjustments that enable a qualified individual "to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employees without disabilities."
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117563, 2010 WL 4449365, at *4 (emphasis in original).
Citing Roloff v. SAP Am., Inc., 432 F. Supp. 2d 1111, 1113 (D. Or. 2006), Kaiser argues that benefits and privileges are limited to "access to lunchrooms, employee lounges, rest rooms, meeting rooms, and other employer sponsored services such as health programs, transportation, and social events." Reply 8, ECF #34. The Roloff opinion, however, copied this language from the underlying Findings and Recommendations, which quoted the TAM § 3.3. Findings and Recommendations, March 20, 2006, 3:04-cv-00756-HU, ECF #56, at 17. Section 3.3 of the TAM provides only a non-exclusive list of "examples" of benefits and privileges:
Reasonable accommodations must be provided to enable an employee with a disability to enjoy benefits and privileges of employment equal to those enjoyed by similarly situated non-disabled employees.
For example: Employees with disabilities must have equal access to lunchrooms, employee lounges, rest rooms, meeting rooms, and other employer-provided or sponsored services [*21]  such as health programs, transportation, and social events.
TAM § 3.3. Kaiser ignores § 7.1 of the TAM, which refers to "compensation, insurance, leave, and other benefits and privileges of employment." (emphasis added.) More importantly, Kaiser ignores that the ADA includes "employee compensation" among its list of "privileges of employment."1 42 USC § 12112(a).
The decision in Bower v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 156 F.Supp. 2d 678, 681 (W.D. Tenn. 2001) ("Bower I"), illustrates that benefits and privileges may constitute substantially more than access to restrooms, transportation, and social events. In Bower I, defendant FedEx offered its employees the opportunity to ride "jumpseat," i.e., to use the limited passenger seating available on its cargo flights as a fringe benefit of employment. However, FedEx did not permit Bower, a disabled employee, and the other disabled employees to ride jumpseat. The plaintiffs sued, claiming FedEx failed to provide them with a reasonable accommodation. Bower also claimed that FedEx's policy of denying him the privilege of riding jumpseat caused him to suffer lost wages, to incur expenses for air travel, and to suffer emotional distress damages.
The court held that "riding jumpseat constitutes a fringe benefit covered by the ADA." Id. at 681. "Despite Defendant's argument [*22]  that the ADA does not cover personal benefits, § 12112(a) specifically includes 'privileges of employment' within its coverage." Id. at 686 (citing 42 USC § 12112(a)). The court also recognized that under 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1)(iii), "[r]easonable accommodation includes not only those measures necessary for an employee to perform the essential functions of his position, but also those that enable the employee to enjoy equal privileges and benefits of employment as are enjoyed by other similarly-situated employees without disabilities." Id. at 687. Thus, the court held, "FedEx must consider reasonable accommodations for Plaintiffs with regard to all of its fringe benefits, including the jumpseat privilege." Bower v. Fed. Express Corp., 287 F. Supp. 2d 840, 845 (W.D. Tenn. 2003) ("Bower II").
The court further held that it was for the jury to decide whether the plaintiffs' requested accommodation of placing them on commercial airline flights was a reasonable accommodation, even though it would result in a cost to FedEx and provide the plaintiffs with a preference. Id. at 846. The court cited Supreme Court's decision in U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 398, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002), which held that "[t]he simple fact that an accommodation would provide a 'preference'—in the sense that it would permit the worker with a disability to violate a rule that others must obey—cannot, in and of itself, automatically [*23]  show that the accommodation is not 'reasonable.'" Bower II, 287 F. Supp. at 846.
In Lee's case, full-time pharmacists without disabilities were scheduled to work five shifts per week, and received benefits and privileges in the form of sick leave accrual, premium pay, and supplemental pension contributions. Lee wanted to work a full-time schedule, like her non-disabled counterparts. Although she was scheduled to work five days a week, depending on whether Lee's supervisor scheduled her to work on Mondays and Tuesdays—days that her supervisor knew Lee could not work for medical reasons—Lee only had the potential to work full time. In fact, during a 54-week period, Lee worked only two full-time, five-day weeks, and those weeks were the only ones where she was given her requested Wednesday-Sunday schedule.2 Lee Decl., Ex. 22, ECF #27-22. Lee otherwise had to use sick leave, thereby losing the ability to accrue sick leave and supplemental pension contributions in the same manner as her non-disabled colleagues. Thus, Lee has presented evidence that Kaiser did not provide her with a modification or adjustment that allowed her to enjoy the same benefits and privileges that her non-disabled counterparts received.
Kaiser [*24]  argues that "the benefit of [Lee's] employment with Kaiser was her right to use FMLA leave and take advantage of Kaiser's generous paid sick time program when she was not able to come to work." Reply 8-9, ECF #34. Kaiser's argument misses the point. Lee does not complain that she was unable to use sick leave. Rather, she asserts that Kaiser failed to provide her with a modification or adjustment that allowed her to maintain the equal benefits and privileges, i.e., the sick leave accrual, premium pay, and supplemental pension contributions, that her non-disabled counterparts received. "Qualified handicapped employees," like Lee, "who can perform all job functions may require reasonable accommodation to allow them to . . . enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment equal to those enjoyed by non-handicapped employees." Buckingham, 998 F.2d at 740. Kaiser was "obligated not to interfere, either through action or inaction, with [Lee's] efforts to pursue a normal life." Id.
Kaiser argues that it "reasonably accommodated [Lee's] disability by providing her with the precise accommodation that she needed, and that her providers recommended: time off to seek medical treatment on Mondays and Tuesdays." Reply 2, ECF [*25]  #34. That argument is flatly contradicted by the uncontroverted evidence in the record.
Lee's treating therapist, Tracy Farmer, unequivocally stated that Lee needed a "regular work schedule Wednesday [through] Sunday with Monday and Tuesday off for treatment." Lloyd Decl., Ex. 11, at 3 (ECF #26-11). Farmer emphasized that Lee "cannot function without [a] regular consistent schedule," and that "[i]rregular scheduling exacerbates [her] inability to cope with stress." Id. When Kaiser requested clarification, Farmer again stated "[i]t is strongly medically recommended that [Lee] have a consistent routine weekly schedule with 2 days off in a row to incorporate rest and recovery and to ensure stabilization from high risk psychiatric [symptoms]." Lloyd Decl., Ex. 13 (ECF #26-13) (emphasis added).
Lee has produced evidence that, contrary to what was professionally prescribed, her schedule was anything but regular and consistent. Rather than receiving the Wednesday—Sunday schedule with two consecutive days off that was "strongly medically recommended," Lee did not know from one month to the next what days she would be working; her schedule was erratic. Lee Decl. ¶ 40. For example, one week she [*26]  was scheduled to work Monday—Wednesday and Friday—Saturday, and the following week she was scheduled to work Sunday—Tuesday and Thursday—Friday. Id., Ex. 22, at 3, ECF #27-22. In neither of those weeks she was scheduled to work Wednesday-Sunday or scheduled for two consecutive days off. As predicted by her therapist, Lee's condition deteriorated. Because she was "at [her] wits end" and "could no longer cope" due to Kaiser's "lack of support," Lee became severely depressed and suicidal, and voluntarily hospitalized herself on February 26, 2016. Id. ¶ 42. Documentation from that hospital stay corroborates that the reason for Lee's hospitalization was the stress related to Kaiser's failure to accommodate. Id., Exs. 23, 24, ECF ##28, 29.
Kaiser relies on a number of cases to support its argument that providing Lee with leave on an as-needed basis was reasonable as a matter of law. Mot. Summ. J. 18-21, ECF #19; Reply 3-8, ECF #34. However, these cases are wholly distinguishable because they do not pertain to the question presented in this case—whether Lee was provided with a modification or adjustment that allowed her to enjoy equal benefits and privileges as similarly-situated non-disabled [*27]  employees.
For instance, Kaiser cites Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir. 1999), as an example of how "[u]npaid medical leave may be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." Reply 5, ECF #34. In Nunes, the plaintiff suffered from a stress-related fainting disorder that caused her to lose consciousness. After experiencing an episode that resulted in injury, she took a medical leave of absence. Her doctor certified that she was incapable of performing her regular or customary work through the end of the year, and she applied for temporary state disability benefits. The employer terminated her employment after learning she was in the hospital. 164 F.3d at 1245-46. The district court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment, and the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiff was totally disabled and therefore unqualified under the ADA. Id. at 1247. The court held that "[t]he ADA requires that Nunes be able to perform the essential functions of her job 'with or without reasonable accommodation'" and that "[u]npaid medical leave may be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." Id. (citing 42 USC § 12111(8)). "Even an extended medical leave, or an extension of an existing leave period, may be a reasonable [*28]  accommodation if it does not pose an undue hardship on the employer." Id.
In Nunes, the question was whether any accommodation could have allowed the plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her position, as her doctor certified that she was completely incapable of performing her regular or customary work. Id. at 1245. Thus, Nunes provides no guidance on the situation presented here. Lee, unlike the plaintiff in Nunes, was able to perform the essential functions of her job.
Kaiser also cites Surrell v. California Water Service Company, 518 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 2008), for the proposition that "providing leave (including FMLA leave) to an employee who needs time off work because of a disability is a reasonable accommodation as a matter of law." Reply 4, ECF #34. Surrell did not involve an ADA claim, but instead a claim under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act. Nevertheless, the issue in that case was whether the employee was able to return to work after she was involved in an automobile accident and then, a year later, when her son was murdered. Like Nunes, this case is silent on the issue of a reasonable accommodation in relation to benefits and privileges. Moreover, the employee in that case "admit[ted] that she did not know of any accommodation that [*29]  [the employer] could have provided for her claimed physical disability." Id. at 1109. Here, Lee knew of another accommodation that Kaiser could have provided, and she repeatedly protested that she was not receiving the benefits and privileges afforded to similarly-situated non-disabled employees. Lee Decl. ¶ 10, 15 18, 22, 30, 35, 37, 44-48.
Finally, Kaiser cites Goos v. Shell Oil Co., 451 F. App'x 700 (9th Cir. 2011), a case in which the employee suffered from debilitating depression and her employer accommodated her by providing a leave of absence for several years. However, by certifying that she could not return to work, the plaintiff represented that there were no alternative reasonable accommodations that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her position. Again, like the cases above, Goos does not address the benefits and privileges argument that Lee raises here.
In sum, these Ninth Circuit cases cited by Kaiser illustrate that leave is a reasonable accommodation when the employee cannot perform the essential functions of his or her position without an alternative accommodation. These cases, however, are silent on the issue of what modification and adjustments are required for a disabled employee to receive equal benefits and [*30]  privileges of employment enjoyed by similarly situated non-disabled employees.
Kaiser next relies on three cases to argue that allowing Lee to use paid and unpaid sick leave on Mondays and Tuesdays was reasonable regardless if it required her to forfeit financial benefits. Mot. Summ. J. 19, ECF #19; Reply 5-8, ECF #34. The problem with these cases is that they again focus on the "essential functions" definition of reasonable accommodation to the exclusion of the "benefits and privileges" definition.
In the first case, Santacrose v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 288 Fed.Appx. 655 (11th Cir. 2008), the employer regularly required its employees to work overtime, i.e., more than eight hours per day. The plaintiff suffered from a back injury that prevented him from sitting more than eight consecutive hours. For some time, the employer approved a work restriction under which the plaintiff was not required to work overtime. When the employer revoked this restriction, the plaintiff used unpaid sick leave to avoid working overtime. The plaintiff sued under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, arguing that the employer denied him a reasonable accommodation by not allowing him to "avoid overtime without having to use his company sick leave or FMLA leave." Id. The court held that [*31]  the employer had provided the plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation because "he was allowed to avoid working overtime and maintain an eight-hour restriction by using his leave." Id. The court also noted that the plaintiff had "never been disciplined for failing to work overtime shifts or using his leave time in lieu of working overtime." Id.
However, there is no indication that the employee in Santacrose claimed, as Lee does here, that he could have otherwise made up the hours for which he was required to use leave with a different accommodation. In contrast, Lee claims that she could have performed the essential functions of her position if she had been scheduled to work Wednesdays through Sundays.
Kaiser next relies on James v. Munson Medical Center, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34278, 2016 WL 1055756 (W.D. Mich. 2016). There, the plaintiff's health care provider recommended that the plaintiff have 16 hours of rest between 12-hour shifts, and from two to seven days off per month. The employer granted a series of the plaintiff's requests for leave until she missed six months of work in a nine-month period. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34278, [WL] at *1-2. When one of the plaintiff's doctors opined that he did not know when the plaintiff would be able to return to work if at all, the employer terminated her employment. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34278, [WL] at *4. The [*32]  plaintiff brought a retaliation claim under the FMLA and a discrimination claim under the ADA; the court dismissed both claims on summary judgment. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34278, [WL] at *6.
The court pointed to the fact that plaintiff was allowed to use intermittent FMLA leave to "cover both her need for days off during the month as well as her need for 16 hours of rest between shifts," and therefore found there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the employer denied her a reasonable accommodation. Id. Again, however, as in Santacrose, there is no indication that the plaintiff in James could have otherwise performed the essential functions of her position with a different accommodation. Lee, on the other hand, has provided evidence that she could have.
Finally, Kaiser relies on Ravel v. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Inc., 228 F. Supp. 3d 1086, 1095 (E.D. Cal. 2017). There, the employer placed the plaintiff, who suffered from sciatica and herniated discs, on paid disability leave instead of allowing her to work from home as she requested. Id. at 1095. The court dismissed the plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim, holding that the employer "went beyond what is required under the ADA when it placed plaintiff on paid disability leave." Id. (citing Nunes, 164 F.3d at 1247). Notably, in that case, the plaintiff incurred a 30% pay [*33]  cut by being placed on paid disability leave as opposed to what she would have received if she had been allowed to work from home. Id.
In Ravel, however, the court did not consider whether permitting the plaintiff to work from home was a modification or adjustment that would have allowed her to enjoy benefits and privileges of employment equivalent to those enjoyed by similarly-situated non-disabled employees. See id. at 1093 (discussing 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii) but not 29 CFR § 1630.2(o)(1)(iii)). The Ravel court also cited Humphrey, Nunes, and Dark v. Curry County, 451 F.3d 1078 (9th Cir. 2006), for the proposition that placing an employee on paid leave went beyond the unpaid leave that is required by the ADA. Id. at 1090. However Humphrey, Nunes, and Dark held that granting leave may be a reasonable accommodation when the employee cannot otherwise perform the essential functions of her position—not that leave is a reasonable accommodation when the employee can, as is the case here. Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1135-37 ("A leave of absence for medical treatment may be a reasonable accommodation . . . where a leave of absence would reasonably accommodate an employee's disability and permit him, upon his return, to perform the essential functions of the job, that employee is otherwise qualified under the ADA."); Nunes, 164 F.3d at 1247 (same); Dark, 451 F.3d at 1090 (same).
Moreover, in a case cited by Lee, [*34]  Mamola v. Group Manufacturing Services, Inc., CV-08-1687-PHX-GMS, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35433, 2010 WL 1433491 (D. Ariz. Apr. 9, 2010), which Kaiser does not try to distinguish, the court reached the opposite result than Ravel.
In Mamola, the plaintiff underwent an eye surgery and requested intermittent FMLA leave and permission to telecommute. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35433, [WL] at *1, *4. The employer denied his request and instead put him on unpaid leave. Id. However, the plaintiff "could have performed the duties of his position while he was recovering from eye surgery if the [employer had] granted his request to work from home." Id. (alterations omitted). The court held:
Here, Plaintiffs present evidence that Mr. Mamola could have "perform[ed] the duties of [his] position" while he was recovering from eye surgery if the Company had granted his request to work from home." A reasonable fact finder could therefore conclude that unpaid leave actually prevented [plaintiff] from earning wages for work that he would have performed if [the employer] had granted the requested accommodation. Thus, the Court holds that unpaid leave may not be reasonable when an employee specifically requests another accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of the position without missing work.
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35433, [WL] at *4.
The [*35]  employee in Mamola could have performed the essential functions of his position with an alternative reasonable accommodation, but his employer instead required him to take leave. Similarly, Lee could have worked on other days when she was not scheduled to work and, in fact, wanted to do so. See Lee Decl. ¶ 22; id., Ex. 12 (ECF #27-12) ("I WANT to work 40 hours per week (full-time)."). While Kaiser did not place Lee on a leave of absence, it scheduled her to work on days it knew she would be unable to work. This raises genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Lee was given a modification or adjustment that enabled her to enjoy the equal benefits and privileges of similarly-situated non-disabled employees in the form of "compensation" and "leave" under the ADA, i.e., sick leave accrual, premium pay, and supplemental pension contributions.

2. Lee's Requested Accommodation—Undue Hardship
The court next considers whether Lee's requested accommodation was reasonable and whether providing it would have imposed an undue hardship. It is undisputed that Lee's requested accommodation would have provided her with the opportunity to enjoy all the benefits and privileges of her employment. [*36]  However, genuine issues of material fact remain regarding whether providing this accommodation would have eliminated an essential function of her position and whether it would have been an undue hardship for Kaiser to provide it, thus precluding summary judgment.

2. Lee's Requested Accommodation—Undue Hardship
Kaiser contends that the ability to work rotating shifts was an essential function of Lee's position from January 2015 through May 2016, the time period during which it did not provide her with a full-time Wednesday—Sunday schedule. Kaiser relies on Lee's job description and her supervisor's testimony that no other pharmacists were scheduled on specific days or otherwise allowed to opt out of the rotating-shift requirement. Markesino Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 1; Chau Decl. ¶ 12. Moreover, Kaiser alleges that Lee was one of its weaker pharmacists and that if it had scheduled her to work every weekend, it would have had to schedule one of its stronger pharmacists to make up for her performance, which would have been unfair to the stronger pharmacists. Reply 11-12 (citing Mason v. Avaya Commc'ns, Inc., 357 F.3d 1114, 1121 (10th Cir. 2004) (finding plaintiff's "suggestion that teamwork is not an essential function because other service coordinators can pick [*37]  up the slack in her stead is simply irrelevant in determining whether teamwork is an essential function of the job")). Kaiser also alleges that significant operational changes, including the adoption of new software and the obligation to staff a "Refill Protocol" pharmacist from the Mt. Scott pool of pharmacists, made granting Lee her preferred accommodation an undue hardship. Chau Decl. ¶¶ 15, 18, 29. Kaiser contends that it was able to accommodate Lee's preferred schedule again in May 2016 only because of an improvement in operational performance at Mt. Scott. Id. at ¶¶ 37-40.
However, Lee has proffered evidence to the contrary. For instance, Lee has offered evidence that weekends were less busy and had lower prescription volume than weekdays because the weekend prescriptions were solely from Urgent Care. Sundays were even less busy than Saturdays. Lloyd Decl., Ex. 2, ECF #26-2 (Chau Dep. 33:19-34:6); Id., Ex. 3, ECF #26-3 (Chehab Dep. 32:7-25). She has also offered evidence that her manager, Fadi Chahab, was "very hostile and aggressive toward" her when she made her requested accommodation. Lee Decl. ¶ 15. Lee claims, "It was obvious that he was very angry and I felt bullied and [*38]  threatened because I had called in an FMLA absence." Id. Since being reassigned to a different supervisor, Lee's performance reviews have been "positive," she is consistently told that her numbers are "good," and it is not unusual for her to be assigned to duties normally referred to as the "captain," to keep workflow moving along. Lee Dec. ¶ 51. In sum, the extent of the operational changes at Mt. Scott, scheduling demands, demands on other pharmacists, and underperformance at Mt. Scott, in addition to Lee's relative strength as a pharmacist and as a leader, are inquiries replete with issues of fact. Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Lee, a reasonable jury could find that rotating shifts were merely a pretext to refuse Lee's accommodation and not an essential function of her position and that Kaiser suffered no undue hardship.

3. Interactive Process
Finally, with respect to the last prong of the analysis, a reasonable jury could find that Kaiser did not engage in the interactive process in good faith. The interactive process requires: "(1) direct communication between the employer and employee to explore in good faith the possible accommodations; (2) consideration of the [*39]  employee's request; and (3) offering an accommodation that is reasonable and effective." UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d at 1110 (quoting Zivkovic, 302 F.3d at 1089).
The record contains evidence that Kaiser repeatedly communicated with Lee. Besides the many e-mails and telephone calls exchanged, Kaiser staff met with Lee at least nine times between February 12, 2015, and late 2016. Lee Decl. ¶ 15 (February 12, 2015), ¶ 30 (June 17, 2015), ¶ 35 (July 28, 2015), ¶ 37 (August 6, 2015), ¶ 44 (March 17, 2016), ¶ 45 (April 21, 2016), ¶ 46 (May 5, 2016), ¶ 47(July 14, 2016), ¶ 48 (several meetings in late 2016).
However, "talk alone is not enough." EEOC v. MCI Telecomm. Corp., 993 F. Supp. 726, 732 n.10 (D. Ariz. 1998). Moreover, whether these communications were undertaken in good faith is a question for the jury. See Miller v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 149 F. Supp. 3d 1262, 1278-79 (D. Or. 2016) (holding "this case does not raise the unusual scenario under which the question of the employer's good faith can be resolved at summary judgment"). As mentioned above, Lee asserts that her manager was hostile toward her when she requested her accommodation and was obviously angry at her use of leave. Lee Decl. ¶ 15. Additionally, there is evidence that Kaiser had an ulterior motive in denying her requested accommodation. In an email, Lee's supervisor related that "one of the biggest concerns in regards to [*40]  this accommodation is that it would create a precedent in how future ADA request[s] would be determined." Lloyd Decl., Ex. 28, at 3, ECF #26-28 (emphasis added). Finally, there is the evidence that Kaiser originally allowed Lee to work a Wednesday—Sunday schedule, took it away, and then coincidentally returned it to her after she had exhausted all three of her sick banks and her FMLA leave.3 Thus, construing all inferences in favor of Lee as required by FRCP 56, there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Kaiser engaged in the interactive process in good faith.

C. Punitive Damages
Kaiser argues that, even if Lee's ADA claim survives summary judgment, it is entitled to summary judgment on the issues of compensatory and punitive damages because it acted in good faith. Mot. Summ. J. 28, ECF #19. Under 42 USC § 1981a(a)(3), a plaintiff is not entitled to compensatory or punitive damages under the ADA when the employer "demonstrates good faith efforts . . . to identify and make a reasonable accommodation that would provide [the employee] with an equally effective opportunity and would not cause an undue hardship on the operation of the business."
As discussed above in Section I.B.3, supra, there are genuine [*41]  issues of material fact regarding whether Kaiser acted in good faith. Accordingly, this aspect of Kaiser's motion should be denied as well.

II. FMLA Interference Claim
Lee argues that Kaiser interfered with her rights under the FMLA by forcing her to use involuntary intermittent FMLA leave rather than approving her request for a Wednesday-Sunday schedule, thereby forcing her to exhaust her leave in 2015 and preventing her from using it in February and March of 2016. Compl. ¶40. Kaiser counters that it could not have interfered with Lee's FMLA benefits because she received the full FMLA leave to which she was entitled and because it did not impermissibly force her to take leave. Because Lee's FMLA claim fails as a matter of law, Kaiser's motion for summary judgment should be granted regarding this claim.

A. Relevant Law
It is "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under [the FMLA]." 29 USC § 2615(a)(1). To prove an FMLA interference claim, the employee must establish that: (1) she was eligible for the FMLA's protections, (2) her employer was covered by the FMLA, (3) she was entitled to leave under the FMLA, (4) she provided [*42]  sufficient notice of her intent to take leave, and (5) her employer denied her FMLA benefits to which she was entitled." Sanders v. City of Newport, 657 F.3d 772, 778 (9th Cir. 2011). Here, only the fifth element—whether Kaiser denied Lee FMLA benefits to which she was entitled—is at issue.
The Ninth Circuit has "declined to apply the type of burden shifting framework recognized in McDonnell Douglas [v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)] to FMLA 'interference' claims; rather, '[an employee] can prove this claim, as one might any ordinary statutory claim, by using either direct or circumstantial evidence, or both.'" Sanders, 657 F.3d at 778 (citing Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc., 259 F.3d at 1112, 1125 (9th Cir. 2001)) (alterations in original). The employee must prove her claim by a preponderance of the evidence. Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1125. Further, the employee must prove that she was prejudiced. See Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 89, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002) (defining prejudice as a real impairment resulting in harm). "The employer is liable only for compensation and benefits lost 'by reason of the violation,' § 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I), for other monetary losses sustained 'as a direct result of the violation,' § 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(II) . . . . The remedy is tailored to the harm suffered." Id. "[T]he employer's intent is irrelevant to a determination of liability [in interference claims]." Sanders, 657 F.3d at 778.
The Ninth Circuit has recognized a type of interference claim that the Sixth Circuit has termed an "involuntary-leave [*43]  claim." See Escriba v. Foster Poultry Farms, Inc., 743 F.3d 1236, 1244 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Wysong v. Dow Chem. Co., 503 F.3d 441, 449 (6th Cir. 2007)); see also Clink v. Oregon Health & Sci. Univ., No. 3:13-CV-01323-SI, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107307, 2014 WL 3850013, at *5 (D. Or. Aug. 5, 2014) ("Forcing an employee to take FMLA block leave in an effort to 'burn up' an employee's leave entitlement may constitute unlawful interference under FMLA.") (citing Escriba, supra). An employee may have such a claim "when an employer forces an employee to take FMLA leave when the employee does not have a 'serious health condition' that precludes her from working." Wysong, 503 F.3d at 449. The claim is ripe when the employee later needs to take FMLA leave for a protected purpose but is unable to do so because her FMLA leave has already been exhausted. Id.
When a "serious health condition" of the employee makes the employee "unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee," the employee "has the right to take FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule" but only if such leave is "medically necessary." 29 USC §§ 2612(a) & (b). To take intermittent leave or leave on a reduced-leave schedule, "there must be a medical need for leave and it must be that such medical need can be best accommodated through an intermittent or reduced leave schedule." 29 CFR § 825.202(b) (emphasis added).

B. Analysis
Lee argues that she was forced to "burn up" her FMLA time [*44]  when she was denied her request for a modified Wednesday-Sunday schedule. Response 34, ECF #25. In support, she relies on the "best accommodated through an intermittent or reduced leave schedule" language in 29 CFR § 825.202(b). Id. However, Lee takes the language of the regulation out of context.
The regulations elsewhere state that "the leave provisions of the [FMLA] are wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations of employers covered under the [ADA] . . . ." 29 CFR § 825.702(a) (emphasis added). Whether Kaiser could have modified Lee's schedule to avoid using FMLA leave on Mondays and Tuesdays is irrelevant, because the FMLA does not require an employer to adjust an employee's schedule. See Villegas v. Albertsons, LLC, 96 F. Supp. 3d 624, 634 (W.D. Tex. 2015) ("Adjusting plaintiff's schedule . . . [was] a benefit not conferred by FMLA leave."); Lushute v. Louisiana, Dep't of Soc. Servs., 479 F. App'x 553, 555 (5th Cir. 2012) (holding that a schedule change is not an adverse employment action under the FMLA); Rodriguez v. Webb Hosp. Corp., 234 F. Supp. 3d 834, 840 (S.D. Tex. 2017) (holding that a change in schedule that created more stress for the plaintiff was not an adverse employment action under the FMLA).
Moreover, Lee has otherwise failed to establish an involuntary-leave claim under Escriba and Wysong. Lee was never forced to take FMLA time for a non-medical reason. See Wysong, 503 F.3d at 449 (holding that an employee may have such a [*45]  claim "when an employer forces an employee to take FMLA leave when the employee does not have a 'serious health condition' that precludes her from working"). Kaiser was responsible for designating Lee's leave as FMLA-qualifying, and did exactly what it was required to do. See 29 CFR § 825.300(d)(1) ("[t]he employer is responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as FMLA-qualifying. . . ."); see also Bailey v. Sw. Gas Co., 275 F.3d 1181, 1185 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that employees "need not expressly assert their FMLA rights or even mention the FMLA. Rather, the employer bears the responsibility of determining whether an employees' leave request is covered by the Act. . . .").
Lee's reliance in Jadwin v. Cty. of Kern, 610 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1169-70 (E.D. Cal. 2009), is misplaced. There, the plaintiff claimed that his doctor certified he could work part-time, but his employer forced him to take full-time FMLA leave. Thus, the question was whether the employer forced the plaintiff to take more FMLA leave than was "medically necessary." Here, Lee does not claims that she was forced to take more FMLA leave than medically necessary. Rather she complains that she was not given the modified schedule she requested; however, she was not entitled to such a modified scheduled under the FMLA. The other case Lee cites, Clink, is also [*46]  distinguishable. In Clink, the question was whether the employer impermissibly forced the plaintiff to use block FMLA time. However, the plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of his job, and therefore was not entitled to FMLA leave. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107307, 2014 WL 3850013, at *6. Here, Lee was able to perform the essential functions of her job, but claims that she was denied a modified Wednesday-Sunday schedule. Although, as discussed above, she may have an ADA claim on those facts, her FMLA claim fails as a matter of law.

RECOMMENDATIONS
For the reasons set forth above, Kaiser's motion (ECF #19) should be denied with respect to Lee's ADA claim and granted with respect to her FMLA claim.
