CIVIL MINUTES — GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): Order GRANTING Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) [36] (Filed 12/21/10)

I. INTRODUCTION
Currently before this Court is Defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District's ("Defendant"), Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (Dkt. #36.) Plaintiff, Youlanda Williams ("Plaintiff"), filed an Opposition on January 10, 2011, (Dkt. # 41), to which Defendants filed a Reply on January 14, 2011 (Dkt. # 42). Having considered the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the instant Motion, the Court deems the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED.
Plaintiff, Youlanda Williams, alleges that she has suffered, among other things, Title VII Civil Rights, American with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), and California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") violations throughout her course of employment with the Los Angeles Unified School District. (SAC ¶ 3.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges [*2]  that she has been subjected to continuous acts of harassment, job discrimination, and has had to endure an overall hostile work environment. (Id. ¶ 1.) Plaintiff also alleges that she has been subjected to employment discrimination in violation of the ADA for failure to reasonably accommodate her disability. (Id. ¶ 2.) Lastly, Plaintiff alleges that she has been subjected to retaliation for opposing unlawful employment practices. (Id. ¶ 155.)
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's background facts give rise to causes of action that are barred by the statute of limitations. (Dkt # 42 at 4.) Defendant further argues that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation. (Id. at 5, 7-8.) Accordingly, Defendant moves to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The facts giving rise to this action began in August 2002, when Plaintiff contends that her employer questioned why she had received a poor evaluation at her previous employment and began monitoring her differently than other employees. (SAC ¶ 38.) Shortly thereafter, in September 2002, Plaintiff alleges that her employer made an unwelcomed sexual [*3]  advance, which caused her to submit a complaint. She believes that the filing of the complaint then subjected her to employer retaliation. (Id. ¶ 42-43.) In addition to retaliation, Plaintiff contends that she was subjected to a hostile work environment and disparate treatment for the next six years. (Id. ¶ 43.) As a result of her work environment, Plaintiff alleges that she developed anxiety and depression and was forced to take a leave of absence in November 2004. (Id. ¶ 66.) Upon her return, Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability; specifically, she was transferred to a new place of employment more than 12-15 miles from her place of residence. (Id. ¶ 110.) She also alleges that Defendant's negative job references have resulted in her being unable to find employment elsewhere. (Id. ¶ 107.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD
"To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint generally must satisfy only the minimal notice pleading requirements of Rule 8(a)(2)." Porter v. Jones, 319 F.3d 483, 494 (9th Cir. 2003). Rule 8(a)(2) requires "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). For a complaint to sufficiently state a claim, its "[f]actual allegations must be enough [*4]  to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). Mere "labels and conclusions" or a "formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Id. Rather, to overcome a 12(b)(6) motion, "a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). "The plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement of relief." Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). In light of Twombly and Iqbal, the Ninth Circuit has construed the governing standard to mean that "non-conclusory factual content, and reasonable inferences from that content, must be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief" for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss. Moss v. U.S. Secret Service, 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).
When considering a 12(b)(6) motion, a court is generally limited to considering material within the pleadings [*5]  and must construe "[a]ll factual allegations set forth in the complaint . . . as true and . . . in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff]." See Lee v. City of L.A., 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 453 (9th Cir. 1994) and Epstein v. Washington Energy Co., 83 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 1996)). A court is not, however, "required to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences." Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Plaintiff's Title VII Claims Occurring Before April 30, 2009 are Barred By the Statute of Limitations
Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint ("Complaint") asks this Court to consider allegations between 2002-present. (SAC ¶¶ 38-110.) This Court has previously determined, however, that all claims prior to April 30, 2009, are time-barred by the statute of limitations. (Dkt. #31 at 3-4.)
Accordingly, only the following conduct occurring after April 30, 2009, will be considered "timely acts" in considering Plaintiff's Title VII claims.
• May 2009: Plaintiff alleges she was not paid for overtime work she performed in a timely manner. (Id. ¶ 103.)
• July 2009: Plaintiff alleges that she complained about the delay in overtime payment and that her paycheck was placed on hold with no explanation. (Id. ¶ 104.)
• August 2009: Plaintiff alleges that she was called names [*6]  such as "Ms. Conspiracy" and "Banning Bull-Dog" by other co-workers. She also alleges being labeled as having an attitude, anxiety symptoms and aggressive behavior. (Id. ¶ 105.) Plaintiff alleges that she complained but that no corrective action was taken. Id.
• October 2009: Plaintiff alleges that she was given heavier job assignments. (Id. ¶ 106.)
• October 2009: Plaintiff alleges that Defendant gave her a negative job reference to US Customs and Border Patrol. (Id. ¶ 107.)
• November 2009: Plaintiff alleges that none of her work was covered in her absence during a three-day medical leave. (Id. ¶ 109.)
• February 2010: Plaintiff alleges that she was transferred to a different place of employment, which required her to travel 24 miles each way. (Id. ¶ 110.)
• March 2010: Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated her seniority rights when she was transferred by moving her out of her former position. (Id. ¶ 159.)
• June 2010: Plaintiff alleges that she was replaced by a less senior employee in her former position. (Id. ¶ 162.)
• August 2010: Plaintiff alleges that she failed to receive her paycheck in a timely manner. (Id. ¶ 147.)
• September 2010: Plaintiff alleges that she was transferred [*7]  to a new school that harbored a hostile environment. (Id. ¶ 148.) She contends that she warned the principal that she would write an appeal if she was forced to remain at the school. Id.
• September 2010: Plaintiff alleges that she was transferred to a new school that was overstaffed with people in her position. (Id. ¶ 150.)
This Court will only consider the foregoing acts in determining whether to grant Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.

B. Plaintiff Cannot Establish a Continuing Violation for the Title VII Claims
In an effort to include the acts excluded by the Statute of Limitations, Plaintiff alleges that her Title VII claims establish a continuing violation, thus warranting this Court to consider all charges, including time-barred allegations. (SAC ¶ 19.) Plaintiff contends that amended charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") in February 2010, as well as amended charges filed on May 04, 2010 with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") and EEOC permit tolling of the statute of limitations. Id. This Court previously ruled that Plaintiff's allegations do not qualify as a continuing violation and will not again address this issue. (Dkt. #31 [*8]  at 5.)

C. Plaintiff's Claim for Disability Discrimination Fails to State a Cause of Action
This Court has previously determined that Plaintiff's Claim for Disability Discrimination fails to state a cause of action because she repeatedly alleges adverse treatment without providing any factual allegations that she was negatively treated "because of" discrimination. (Dkt. #31 at 7.) Plaintiff asserts that she was transferred to another place of employment for "pre-textual reasons" and "that the above discriminatory actions were with intent because of Plaintiff's race, color, and mental medical conditions, among other things," but does not support these conclusory statements. (SAC ¶ 142, 145.) Because Plaintiff has not alleged any new facts to support her conclusory statements, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination claim is GRANTED.

D. Plaintiff's Claim for Failure to Accommodate Fails to State a Cause of Action
The ADA requires covered entities to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the [*9]  accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also 42 U.S.C.A. § 12111(2) ("The term 'covered entity' means an employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee.").
However, "[a]n 'employer is not obligated to provide an employee the accommodation he requests or prefers, the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation.'" Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir.2002) (citing E.E.O.C. v. Yellow Freight Sys. Inc., 253 F.3d 943, 951 (7th Cir.2001) (en banc) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Furthermore, "'liability for failure to provide reasonable accommodations ensues only where the employer bears responsibility for the breakdown' in the interactive process." Zivkovic, 302 F.3d at 1089 (quoting Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1137 (7th Cir.1996)). The interactive process requires: (1) direct communication between the employer and employee to explore in good faith the possible accommodations; (2) consideration of the employee's request; and (3) offering an accommodation that is reasonable and effective. Id. at 1114-15 Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1112 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), vacated on other grounds, U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S.Ct. 1516, 152 L.Ed.2d 589 (2002).
Using the same April 30, 2009 window of time to access Plaintiff's alleged wrongful acts, this Court is able to consider the accommodations requested by Plaintiff following her September 2007 to October 2008 leave of absence. Upon returning [*10]  to work in February 2009, Plaintiff alleges to have made three accommodation requests: (1) To be assigned to a work location within a twelve to fifteen mile commute; (2) Not to work in an unfriendly, hostile work environment; and (3) Not to be in the immediate area of the co-worker who threatened her with violence. (SAC ¶ 120, 122.)
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her disability when it transferred her to a site which she characterizes as a hostile work environment that was outside her twelve to fifteen mile commute in February 2010. (Id. ¶ 126, 128.) Plaintiff further alleges that this change caused her to continuously suffer extreme migraine headaches and a sleep disorder both of which affected her ability to concentrate at work and negatively impacted her job performance. (Id. ¶ 127.) Plaintiff does contend, however, that she was transferred to another school in September 2010, which environment she also found to be hostile. Her subsequent transfer request was granted. (Id. ¶ 148, 150.) Plaintiff alleges that her final placement failed to reasonably accommodate her because the school was staffed with five other office technicians. (Id.)
Plaintiff, [*11]  here, fails to establish Defendant's liability for failure to provide reasonable accommodations. Plaintiff communicated her desire to explore alternative accommodations, and as a result, Defendant transferred her to a different school upon each request. As previously discussed, Defendant is not obligated to provide the accommodation that Plaintiff requests or prefers, but only to offer a reasonable and effective placement. Plaintiff does not allege that her final placement fails to satisfy her disability requests to be within a 12-15 mile radius of her place of residence, nor does she allege that it is hostile or in close proximity to threatening co-workers. Instead, Plaintiff allegedly disapproves of her final placement because the school was already staffed with five other employees in her position. She fails, however, to allege why this fact renders the accommodation unreasonable. Consequently, Plaintiff fails to provide any factual support to bolster her assertions that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her requests.
Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Failure to Accommodate claim is GRANTED.

E. Plaintiff's Claim for Disparate Treatment Fails to State [*12]  a Cause of Action
This Court has previously determined that Plaintiff's Claim for Disparate Treatment fails to provide any showing of Defendant's discriminatory intent or motive as required by the Supreme Court. (Dkt. #31 at 10.) Plaintiff's Complaint simply offers conclusory statements alleging she is a victim of discrimination without any evidence which might give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. Because Plaintiff has not alleged any new facts to support her conclusory statements, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Individual Disparate Treatment claim is GRANTED.

F. Plaintiff's Claim for Retaliation Fails to State a Cause of Action
This Court has previously determined that Plaintiff's Claim for Retaliation fails to provide a causal link between Plaintiff's activity and the employment decision (Dkt. #31 at 10.) Plaintiff offers a transcript of the negative job reference given by her employer, but this transcript simply confirms Plaintiff's assertions that were previously dismissed for failure to establish a causal link. Because Plaintiff has not alleged any new facts to support her conclusory statements, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Retaliation claim [*13]  is GRANTED.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. The Court shall afford Plaintiff a final opportunity to amend her complaint within 20 days from the date of this order. Failure to serve and file an amended complaint will result in dismissal of this action.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
