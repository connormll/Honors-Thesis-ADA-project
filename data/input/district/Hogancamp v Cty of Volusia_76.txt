Opinion



ORDER
Plaintiff Wanda Hogancamp sued her employer Defendant County of Volusia for purported violations of the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). (See Docs. 1, 61.) Defendant moved for summary judgment. (Doc. 64 ("Motion").) Plaintiff responded (Doc. 66), and Defendant replied (Doc. 68). Upon review, the Motion is due to be granted.

I. Background1
Plaintiff has worked for Defendant since 2009, and she currently holds the position of Office Assistant III in the Fleet Management Department of Central Services. (Doc. 64-2, ¶ 2; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 2.) During her employment, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant interfered with her FMLA leave, failed to accommodate her mental health disability, and otherwise discriminated and retaliated against her for asserting her rights under the FMLA and ADA. (See Doc. 61.) The Court begins with Plaintiff's assertion of her FMLA [*2]  and ADA rights and then turns to what followed.

A. Plaintiff's Assertion of FMLA and ADA Rights
This case stems from an undeniable tragedy: in June of 2017, Plaintiff's son died in an automobile accident—the second son she lost in this type of accident. (Doc. 66-1, ¶ 4; Doc. 65-1, p. 7:12-14.) After the accident, Plaintiff's sister contacted Plaintiff's direct supervisor, Fleet Operations Manager Robert Gilmore. (Doc. 65-4, pp. 7:7-8:3; Doc. 64-2, ¶ 2.) Mr. Gilmore told Plaintiff to take as much time away from work as needed and helped her obtain the necessary paperwork for FMLA leave. (Doc. 65-2, pp. 2-9; Doc. 65-1, pp. 13:4-19:23.) Plaintiff was then approved for full-time FMLA leave until August 15, 2017 due to her mental health condition following the accident, as supported by her doctor's certifications. (Doc. 64-2, ¶¶ 3-4; Doc. 65-1, pp. 7:12-12:20.)
As the end of Plaintiff's approved full-time FMLA leave approached, Plaintiff and Mr. Gilmore discussed Plaintiff's plan via text message. (Doc. 65-2, pp. 13-16.) During those conversations, Plaintiff expressed a desire to return to work part time, and Mr. Gilmore was empathetic and supportive of Plaintiff's decision, noting that if [*3]  her doctor disagreed, she should follow the doctor's advice. (See id.) Despite text messages to the contrary, Plaintiff says Mr. Gilmore pressured her to return to work during a phone conversation—a conversation Mr. Gilmore says didn't happen.2 (See Doc. 65-1, pp. 25:23-35:9; Doc. 66-1, ¶¶ 5, 8; Doc. 66-3, ¶¶ 6-7; Doc. 66-2, ¶¶ 6-7; Doc. 65-4, pp. 9:5-12:15.) So Plaintiff returned to work on intermittent FMLA leave starting August 21, 2017, but only after her doctor approved her to work part time. (Doc. 64-1, ¶ 2; Doc. 64-2, ¶ 4; Doc. 65-3, p. 2; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 9.)
According to Plaintiff, in October 2017, she was told to return to work full time because her FMLA hours were about to be exhausted. (See Doc. 66-1, ¶ 11.) In response, Plaintiff spoke to Mr. Gilmore at length about her condition and treatment and requested an adjusted schedule to manage her condition. (Doc. 66-1, ¶ 13; Doc. 65-1, pp. 42:2-43:12.) Plaintiff says Mr. Gilmore told her that an adjusted schedule wouldn't be a problem—another conversation he says never happened.3 (Doc. 65-1, pp. 42:25-53:11; Doc. 66-1, ¶¶ 14, 16; Doc. 64-2, ¶¶ 5-6; Doc. 65-4, pp. 13:1-14, 87:24.) Then on October 25, 2017, Plaintiff's doctor certified [*4]  that Plaintiff could return to work full duty with no restrictions.4 (Doc. 64-1, pp. 4-5.)
Plaintiff returned to work full time but did not work her previous 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. schedule that week, so Mr. Gilmore told her on October 27, 2017 to return to her previous schedule.5 (See Doc. 66-1, ¶ 17; Doc. 65-2, pp. 25-26; Doc. 64-2, ¶¶ 5-6.) Plaintiff then submitted a formal letter to Mr. Gilmore on October 30, 2017 requesting an adjusted schedule of 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.6 (Doc. 65-3, p. 7; Doc. 65-1, p. 53:15-19; Doc. 64-2, ¶ 4; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 21.) The letter states the schedule change would allow Plaintiff to care for her son and attend extensive grieving meetings; it says nothing about Mr. Gilmore promising Plaintiff a schedule change. (Doc. 65-3, p. 7.) This request was denied.7 (Doc. 66-1, ¶ 22.) Plaintiff then texted Mr. Gilmore on November 1, 2017, indicating that her request for a modified schedule was a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA—Mr. Gilmore's first indication the ADA was at issue. (Doc. 65-2, p. 26; Doc. 65-3, p. 6; Doc. 65-4, pp. 20:17-21:1.)
Plaintiff then sought clarification on what documentation she needed to support her accommodation [*5]  request by writing a letter and speaking to the Director of Central Services, George Baker.8 (Doc. 66-1, ¶ 24; Doc. 65-3, pp. 8-9; Doc. 65-6, p. 15:2-7.) After this, Plaintiff provided a letter from her therapist, Gina-Marie Francolino. (Doc. 64-1, p. 6 ("Francolino Letter").) The Francolino Letter states:
Please be advised that Wanda Hogancamp and her son . . . have been receiving services via the Halifax Health-Hospice BeginAgain Children's Grief Center and Traumatic Loss Program since July 21, 2017 due to the traumatic and untimely deaths of her 2 oldest sons. Wanda presents with symptoms of PTSD which meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis as well as Complicated Grief. Various treatment modalities are being utilized in sessions within the scope of trauma informed care and evidenced based practice. Wanda has been actively participating in therapy and is committed to the therapeutic process for both herself and her son.
Due to the immensely traumatic nature of this family's circumstance, consistent grief support and counseling is imperative to their healing and continued growth. Wanda and [her son] continue to struggle with both the imagery and circumstances surrounding their loved [*6]  ones['] deaths which demonstrate their need for ongoing therapeutic services. She and [her son] would benefit if they were able to attend various individual and social supports. I am hopeful that you may consider allowing Wanda the opportunity to have a reasonable, flexible, more open schedule in order for her to accommodate any grief counseling or related-medical appointment needs for her or [her son].
It is this clinician's recommendation that Wanda and [her son] continue to participate in grief and trauma therapy to continue healing their trauma allowing them to move forward with their life.
(Id.) Plaintiff also contacted the Director of Human Resources, Tom Motes, as Human Resources is responsible for ADA accommodation requests. (Doc. 65-3, p. 9; Doc. 64-1, ¶ 5; Doc. 65-5, p. 11:18-23; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 27.)
On November 29, 2017, Plaintiff met with Mr. Baker, Mr. Motes, and two other HR employees ("HR Meeting"). (See Doc. 65-5, pp. 13:4-16:2; Doc. 64-1, ¶ 7; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 30.) Plaintiff remembers the HR Meeting like this:
I have been treated by my superiors less than favorable [sic] since the announcement of my disability. After my repeated requests for my accommodations have been denied, [*7]  the tone of the meeting became one [of] marginalization, invalidation, and barely repressed hostility towards myself. . . .
It was no longer a real question to help, it was an interrogation: who my doctors were, what kind of doctors, what and why was I seeing these doctors and why couldn't I see them after 5:00 p.m.? There was an inquiry of as to why I needed to see someone almost every day.
. . . .
As I was looking around the table, I became aware that not one person was really there to help me out in this situation. I felt betrayed, alone and afraid.
(Doc. 65-1, pp. 68:7-71:17.) Although Plaintiff says she provided sufficient information to support her request, the others continued to interrogate her about private medical information, and Mr. Motes even slammed a book on the table in anger. (Doc. 65-1, pp. 68:7-71:22, 142:8-143:10; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 30.) Due to the fear and intimidation she felt from this, Plaintiff asked that they put their request for additional information in writing so the meeting could end. (Doc. 66-1, ¶ 30.)
The others at the HR Meeting remember it differently. According to them, they asked Plaintiff many questions to try to discern whether Plaintiff was entitled to [*8]  her requested accommodation, including why Plaintiff needed to leave work early every day, what counseling sessions she had scheduled during work hours, and whether she could attend counseling after work. (Doc. 65-5, pp. 13:4-16:2; Doc. 65-6, pp. 35:2-36:21; 64-1, ¶¶ 6-7.) But Plaintiff consistently refused to answer and instead was evasive and accusatory, ultimately demanding that all questions be put in writing. (Doc. 64-1, ¶ 7; Doc. 65-5, pp. 14:1-16:2; Doc. 65-6, p. 36:10-21.) After pleading for answers, Mr. Motes told Plaintiff he would put the requested information in writing and said if she provides the information, he will change her schedule. (Doc. 65-5, p. 15:2-6; Doc. 65-6, pp. 36:22-37:7.)
After the HR Meeting, the HR Activity Project Manager, Chandra Gordon, sent Plaintiff a letter from Mr. Motes acknowledging the information they had in support of Plaintiff's ADA accommodation and requesting additional documents. (Doc. 64-1, pp. 8-9 ("Motes Letter").) Specifically, the Motes Letter requested Plaintiff provide: (1) a letter from her grief counselor stating how often Plaintiff needs to attend counseling, how long the appointments last, and what time appointments can be scheduled; [*9]  (2) a release of information form; and (3) an ADA Medical Certification form completed by Plaintiff's doctor. (Id.) At bottom, Mr. Motes needed something more definitive—that Plaintiff required her requested schedule. (Doc. 65-6, pp. 29:25-31:7.) The Motes Letter gave Plaintiff fifteen days to comply and listed Ms. Gordon's contact information should Plaintiff have questions. (Doc. 64-1, pp. 8-9.) But Plaintiff never provided the requested information or contacted Ms. Gordon with any questions. (Doc. 65-1, pp. 72:22-82:20; Doc. 64-1, ¶ 10.) Ms. Gordon even emailed Plaintiff reminding her about the outstanding request, but she never responded. (Doc. 64-1, ¶ 9.) Instead, Plaintiff used her personal leave for appointments during work hours.9 (Doc. 65-1, p. 145:11-16; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 31.)
Then, in January 2018, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission ("EEOC") regarding her assertion of FMLA and ADA rights and escalating harassment Plaintiff alleged she was suffering due to exercising those rights. (Doc. 66-1, ¶ 35; Doc. 65-1, pp. 99:23-25; Doc. 65-3, p. 36.)

B. The Aftermath of the Assertion of Rights
After Plaintiff asserted her rights under [*10]  the FMLA and ADA, the following happened. Plaintiff says around the time she filed her EEOC Charge, Mr. Gilmore and others began acting hostile toward her by not speaking to her, being rude to her, and taking away her job responsibilities. (Doc. 66-1, ¶¶ 32, 34, 53.) In early February, Plaintiff was notified that Activity Project Manager Michele Leigh cancelled the desk audit scheduled to consider Plaintiff's proposal for a new position of "Senior Staff Specialist." (Doc. 64-3, ¶¶ 2-8; Doc. 65-3, pp. 58-61; Doc. 65-6, pp. 42:4-44:4.) This, Plaintiff perceived, was a denial of a promotion and pay raise she says she discussed with Mr. Gilmore prior to taking FMLA leave.10 (Doc. 66-1, ¶¶ 3, 6, 37; Doc. 66-2, ¶ 8; Doc. 66-3, ¶ 8.) Later in February, due to her excessive absenteeism, Mr. Baker directed Plaintiff to provide certifications from her physician or clinician whenever she took sick leave or unscheduled leave.11 (Doc. 64-5, ¶¶ 3-4; id. at 3; Doc. 65-3, p. 37; Doc. 64-2, ¶ 13; Doc. 65-6, pp. 45:21-46:10.) Plaintiff was also told to indicate a reason ("medical appointment, clinical appointment, vacation") when she submitted a leave request using the computer system. (Doc. 64-5, ¶ 4; Doc. 65-3, [*11]  p. 37; Doc. 65-1, pp. 112:24-113:24.) Plaintiff says she complied, but Defendant says it gave up requiring Plaintiff to submit these certifications due to sporadic compliance. (Doc. 66-1, ¶¶ 38-39, 47, 61; Doc. 65-3, pp. 38-42; Doc. 65-4, pp. 60:6-74:1.) And later in 2018, Plaintiff received multiple employee performance notices ("EPN")—written reprimands—for calling in sick after the start of her shift, making errors in her work, using an aromatherapy device, and having excessive absenteeism. (Doc. 65-4, p. 121-22.) But none of these EPNs resulted in suspension, demotion, or a reduction in pay.12 (Doc. 64-2, ¶ 15.)
Ultimately, from June 22, 2017 to August 18, 2017, Plaintiff used 328 hours (8.2 weeks) of full-time FMLA leave and an additional 88 hours (2.2 weeks) of intermittent FMLA leave. (Doc. 64-2, ¶ 8.) And from November 2017 to June 22, 2018, Plaintiff took an additional 311 hours and 15 minutes (7.78 weeks) of leave. (Doc. 64-2, ¶ 8.) So in the 12-month period starting June 22, 2017, Plaintiff used over 18 weeks of paid leave to manage her condition. (Doc. 64-2, ¶¶ 8.) This is coupled with Plaintiff's 20 unscheduled late-in or early-out occurrences and 40.5 hours of unscheduled [*12]  leave around this time. (Doc. 64-2, ¶ 13.) Still, Plaintiff remains in the same position she held when that period began and never received any reduction in pay. (Doc. 64-2, ¶ 8; Doc. 65-1, p. 11:10-15.)
Finally, in September 2018, Plaintiff provided Defendant an ADA Medical Certification form completed by her counselor, Bart Colom. (Doc. 64-4, p. 2; Doc. 65-3, pp. 62-64.) As a result, Mr. Motes approved Plaintiff's requested schedule change of 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., with a half hour for lunch. (Doc. 64-4, ¶ 4; id. at 2.) But according to Plaintiff, her condition has not improved because things remain very "hostile" at work as certain employees are rude and do not speak to her. (Doc. 65-1, pp. 146:21-147:18; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 53; Doc. 66-2, ¶ 10; Doc. 66-3, ¶ 10.) In sum, Plaintiff says if she had known she would be treated this way, she wouldn't have taken FMLA leave, requested an accommodation, or filed the EEOC Charge. (Doc. 66-1, ¶¶ 59-61.)

C. The Instant Action
Plaintiff sued Defendant on April 1, 2018 for retaliation under the FMLA. (Doc. 1 ("Original Complaint").) With the Original Complaint, she also filed an emergency motion for preliminary injunction seeking, inter alia, that the Court [*13]  order Defendant to cease its inquiries into Plaintiff's condition and allow Plaintiff to resume full-time work on her requested schedule, which the Court denied. (Docs. 2, 5, 43.) Following multiple amendments to her Original Complaint (see Docs. 26, 29), Plaintiff filed the operative complaint on October 3, 2018, this time asserting: Count I, FMLA retaliation; Count II, FMLA interference; Count III, ADA discrimination; Count IV, ADA retaliation; and Count V, ADA violation for perceived disability. (Doc. 61 ("Complaint").)
Now Defendant moves for summary judgment on all Counts, arguing that Defendant did not violate the FMLA or ADA. (Doc. 64.) Briefing complete (Docs. 66, 68), the matter is ripe.

II. Legal Standards
Summary judgment is appropriate only if the movant shows there is "no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). On issues for which the movant has the burden at trial, it must show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and support its motion with credible evidence demonstrating that no reasonable jury could find for the nonmoving party on the essential elements. Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir. 1993) (citing United States v. Four Parcels of Real Property, 941, F.2d 1428, 1438 (11th Cir. 1991)). [*14] 
On issues for which the nonmovant would bear the burden of proof the movant has two options: (1) it may simply point out a lack of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case; or (2) it may provide "affirmative evidence demonstrating that the nonmoving party will be unable to prove its case at trial." Four Parcels, 941 F.2d at 1438 (citing Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325). "The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party, who must go beyond the pleadings and present affirmative evidence to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists." Porter v. Ray, 461 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir. 2006) (citing Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1115-17).
"A factual dispute is genuine 'if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'" Four Parcels, 941 F.2d at 1437 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Battle v. Bd. of Regents, 468 F.3d 755, 759 (11th Cir. 2006), so that "when conflict arises between the facts evidenced by the parties, [the] court credit[s] the nonmoving party's version," Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272, 1278 (11th Cir. 2005). Yet "[the] court need not permit a case to go to a jury . . . when the inferences that are drawn from the evidence, and upon which the nonmovant relies, are 'implausible.'" Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., 93 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir. 1996). "When opposing parties tell two different stories, [*15]  one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007).

III. Analysis
Defendant moves for summary judgment because: (1) it did not interfere with Plaintiff's FMLA rights ("FMLA Interference Argument"); (2) it did not discriminate against Plaintiff by failing to provide her ADA accommodation ("ADA Discrimination Argument"); and (3) it did not retaliate against Plaintiff for asserting her FMLA and ADA rights ("Retaliation Argument"). (Doc. 64.) Plaintiff disagrees. (Doc. 66.) The Court address each in turn.13

A. FMLA Interference Argument
First up is whether Defendant interfered with Plaintiff's FMLA rights. Under the FMLA, it is "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise" of FMLA rights. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1).14 To establish an FMLA interference claim, an employee must "demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the benefit denied." Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1206-07 (11th Cir. 2001). The employee must also demonstrate that she "has been prejudiced by the violation in some way." Evans v. Books-A-Million, 762 F.3d 1288, 1295 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 89, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002)). To prove such prejudice an [*16]  employee "need only demonstrate some harm remediable by either 'damages' or 'equitable relief.'" See id. at 1296 (citing Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89)). "An employee need not 'allege that his employer intended to deny the right; the employer's motives are irrelevant.'" Martin v. Brevard Cty. Pub. Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208).
Here, considering Plaintiff's best case, the Court finds that although genuine issues of material fact may exist as to whether Plaintiff's FMLA leave was interfered with—namely, by pressure and demands from Mr. Gilmore to return to work (see Doc. 65-1, pp. 25:23-35:9; Doc. 66-1, ¶¶ 5, 8; Doc. 66-3, ¶¶ 6-7; Doc. 66-2, ¶¶ 6-7; Doc. 65-4, pp. 9:5-12:15)—Plaintiff cannot show she was prejudiced by any interference. These facts are undisputed: (1) Plaintiff received all the FMLA leave she requested; (2) Defendant acted in accordance with her doctor's certifications that she could work; (3) in total she received paid leave in excess of the FMLA's guaranteed 12-week period; (4) she remains in the position she held before she took FMLA leave; and (5) she did not suffer a pay decrease or loss of benefits. (Doc. 64-2, ¶¶ 3-4, 8; Doc. 64-1, ¶ 2, pp. 4-5; Doc. 65-3, p. 2; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 9; Doc. 65-1, pp. 11:10-15, 98:2-99:9.) Thus, Plaintiff cannot show that [*17]  she suffered any harm remediable by any monetary damages or equitable relief provided by the FMLA. See Evans, 762 F.3d at 1296; see also Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir. 1999) ("[A] plaintiff suffers no FMLA injury when she receives all the leave she requests, and indeed is paid for most of it.").
Plaintiff's proffered prejudice is unavailing. Plaintiff contends she would be entitled to equitable relief from the FMLA interference, such as an additional two weeks of full-time leave to compensate for the FMLA leave she did not receive, even though she didn't suffer any monetary damages. (Doc. 66, p. 11.) While the FMLA does provide for both monetary damages and other appropriate equitable relief, see 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1),15 Plaintiff cannot show the equitable relief of additional leave is appropriate. Although Plaintiff used only about 10 weeks of FMLA leave, she was paid for over 18 weeks of leave—well in excess of the FMLA's 12 weeks. (See Doc. 64-2, ¶ 8; Doc. 65-1, pp. 98:2-99:9.) Additionally, had Plaintiff taken the full 12 weeks of FMLA leave, Plaintiff's personal leave balance would have been even less, as FMLA leave constitutes personal leave. (Doc. 66-4, p. 18; see also Doc. 64-2, ¶ 9.) So Plaintiff would not be entitled to any additional paid leave for the [*18]  alleged FMLA interference.16 Thus, summary judgment is warranted on Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim.

B. ADA Discrimination Argument
Next is whether Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff because of her disability. To establish a prima facie case of ADA discrimination, "the plaintiff must show that: (1) he is disabled; (2) he was a 'qualified individual' at the relevant time, meaning he could perform the essential functions of the job in question with or without reasonable accommodations; and (3) he was discriminated against because of his disability." Lucas v. WW. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing Reed v. Heil Co., 206 F.3d 1055, 1061 (11th Cir. 2000)). "An employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer fails to provide 'reasonable accommodations' for the disability—unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the employer." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255 (first citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); then citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a)). "Whether an accommodation is reasonable depends on specific circumstances." Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626 (11th Cir. 1998).
"'To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation, it may be necessary for [an employer] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual with a disability in need of the accommodation' to identify the employee's limitations and any possible accommodations." [*19]  Williams v. Revco Disc. Drug Ctrs., Inc., 552 F. App'x 919, 922 (11th Cir. 2004)17 (alteration in original) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)). If this happens, "[l]iability simply cannot arise under the ADA when an employer does not obstruct an informal interactive process; makes reasonable efforts to communicate with the employee and provide accommodations based on the information it possesses; and the employee's actions cause a breakdown in the interactive process." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted).
Here, the Court finds that Defendant did not discriminate against Plaintiff by failing to provide her the reasonable accommodation of a modified schedule. When Plaintiff made her accommodation request, the only information Defendant had to rely on—apart from Plaintiff's own assertions—was her doctor's certification that she could work without restrictions and the Francolino Letter suggesting scheduling accommodations. (See Doc. 64-1, pp. 4-9.) Yet the Francolino Letter is silent as to Plaintiff's limitations or the need for a modified schedule, such as by noting that Plaintiff cannot work in the afternoons or attend treatment after work hours. (See Doc. 64-1, p. 6.). As Defendant could not determine the precise nature of Plaintiff's limitations or the appropriateness of her requested accommodation [*20]  on this information alone, Defendant—as permissible—engaged in an interactive process and requested additional documentation to make those determinations. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3) (permitting an interactive process for this reason); see also 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. ("When the need for an accommodation is not obvious, an employer, before providing a reasonable accommodation, may require that the individual with a disability provide documentation of the need for accommodation.").
The extent of the interactive process is undisputed. The process began with the HR Meeting, which involved asking Plaintiff for additional details about her limitations and treatment and why she needed her requested schedule. (See Doc. 65-5, pp. 13:4-16:2; Doc. 64-1, ¶¶ 6-7; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 30; Doc. 65-6, pp. 35:2-36:21.) It ended with the Motes Letter requiring Plaintiff to provide, inter alia, a letter from her therapist and a doctor certification establishing Plaintiff's precise limitations and the need for a schedule change. (Doc. 64-1, pp. 8-9.) Plaintiff never provided this information and instead opted to use her personal leave for appointments rather than pursuing her accommodation further. (Doc. 65-1, pp. 72:22-82:20, 145:11-16; Doc. 64-1, [*21]  ¶¶ 9-10; Doc. 66-1, ¶ 31.) So Defendant did not deny Plaintiff's accommodation request; Plaintiff abandoned it. With that, no reasonable jury could find ADA discrimination on this record. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287 (stating no liability under the ADA when the employer properly engages in interactive process and "the employee's actions cause a breakdown in the interactive process").
Plaintiff attempts to avoid blame for the lack of accommodation by arguing that Defendant did not engage in good faith in the interactive process and instead discriminated against her. (Doc. 66, pp. 12-14.) This, she says, is evidenced by: (1) discriminatory statements made during the HR Meeting; (2) Defendant's unwritten policy to deny accommodation requests; and (3) the "disingenuous" requests for additional information as she already provided sufficient information to support her requested accommodation. (Id. at 12-14.) The Court is unpersuaded given the unsupported, conclusory nature of the assertions about Defendant's purported discriminatory statements and unwritten policies and given the appropriateness of Defendant's request for additional documentation as discussed above. Plaintiff cannot point the finger at Defendant when her own [*22]  shortcomings in seeking the accommodation prevented her from receiving it.18
Because Plaintiff caused the breakdown in the interactive process by not providing the requested information and opted not to pursue her accommodation request further—meaning Defendant never even denied the request—the Court concludes no reasonable jury could find Defendant failed to engage in good faith in the interactive process or otherwise improperly failed to provide Plaintiff's requested accommodation. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287; see also Anderson v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 418 F. App'x 881, 883-84 (11th Cir. 2011) (finding summary judgment appropriate for an employer where the employer engaged in interactive process and attempted to accommodate the plaintiff). So Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim.19

C. Retaliation Argument
Last is whether Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff for asserting her rights under the FMLA or ADA. Both the FMLA and ADA prohibit retaliation.20 See Batson v. Salvation Army, 897 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir. 2018). In assessing an FMLA or ADA retaliation claim in the absence of direct evidence of an employer's retaliatory intent, courts apply the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Id. at 1328-29. First, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation [*23]  by demonstrating that: "(1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) he experienced an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action." Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1297 (11th Cir. 2006) (citations omitted). If the plaintiff does, the defendant has the burden "to articulate a legitimate reason for the adverse action." Id. And "[i]f the defendant does so, the plaintiff must then show that the defendant's proffered reason for the adverse action is pretextual." Id.
Here, the Court starts with Plaintiff's prima facie case, specifically the adverse employment action element.21 Plaintiff contends that she experienced the following adverse employment actions: For FMLA retaliation, she experienced heightened scrutiny of her ADA accommodation request and the ultimate denial of the request, discouragement from accessing her disability rights, a hostile work environment, invasion of her medical privacy, different treatment, and difficulty in maintaining employment.22 (Doc. 61, ¶ 66; Doc. 66, pp. 14-17.) For ADA retaliation, she was no longer considered for a promotion, disciplined and placed under additional scrutiny, and subjected to a hostile work environment.23 (Doc. [*24]  61, ¶ 97; Doc. 66, pp. 14-17.) Plaintiff also contends that the requisite causal connection is established by the temporal proximity between these alleged adverse actions and her assertion of her FMLA and ADA rights. (Id. at 14.)
At issue is whether Plaintiff's proffered adverse employment actions constitute the requisite adverse action for a retaliation claim. For retaliation claims, "adverse action . . . encompass[es] any action by an employer which has a materially adverse effect on the plaintiff." Hodgetts v. City of Venice, Fla., 794 F. Supp. 2d 1265, 1275 (M.D. Fla. 2011) (citing Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 973 (11th Cir. 2008). The "plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse." Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006). Materially adverse actions are those that "might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, "[a]n employment action is considered 'adverse' only if it results in some tangible, negative effect on the plaintiff's employment." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260; see also Luna v. Walgreen Co., 575 F. Supp. 2d 1326, 1342 n.14 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (noting that anti-retaliation provisions only protect employees "from retaliation that produces injury or harm").
Plaintiff's asserted adverse actions fall short of this standard as Plaintiff failed to demonstrate she experienced anything [*25]  that negatively affected her employment or harmed her in any way. Defendant's request for additional medical documentation to support Plaintiff's ADA accommodation request was proper, and Defendant never even denied the request. See supra Section III.B.24 The additional documentation Plaintiff had to provide to support her absences and any other "heightened scrutiny" she experienced was at most inconvenient for Plaintiff and her providers. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260. The only "discipline" Plaintiff experienced, receiving EPNs, never led to any other repercussions. See id. at 1261 ("Negative performance evaluations, standing alone, do not constitute adverse employment action . . . under the ADA."). And Plaintiff was never promised a promotion. (See Doc. 65-1, pp. 120:6-124:21.) Her desire for a reclassification to a position that did not even exist, accompanied by a $5.00 an hour pay raise, was purely speculative—she suffered no tangible harm by not receiving it.25 See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260; Luna, 575 F. Supp. 2d at 1342 n.14.
Ultimately, Plaintiff remains in the same position she had before she asserted any of her FMLA or ADA rights, without suffering any decrease in pay or loss of benefits due to Defendant's actions. [*26]  As such, Plaintiff had a high hill to climb to show she experienced any adverse employment action, and she didn't reach the summit. See Luna, 575 F. Supp. 2d at 1342 n.14; Burlington, 548 U.S. at 68. Thus, on this record, the Court finds that Plaintiff failed to meet her burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation, warranting summary judgment on her retaliation claims.26
Still, assuming arguendo Plaintiff had established a prima facie case of retaliation, her retaliation claims would fare no better as she has not shown that Defendant's nondiscriminatory, nonretaliatory reasons for its employment actions were pretextual. "Once the employee has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action." Batson, 897 F.3d at 1328-29 (citing Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1297). To that end, Defendant maintains: (1) it did not accommodate Plaintiff's request for a schedule change because she did not provide the necessary information to justify the change and because Defendant needed administrative staff to work in the afternoons to cover the service desk and phones; (2) it did not make Plaintiff "Senior Staff Specialist" because the job did not exist and because her job duties fell within her current classification; [*27]  (3) it did not give Plaintiff a raise because it was not promised or deserved; and (4) it required Plaintiff to justify her leave requests and provide documentation of her appointments because of her excessive absenteeism, consistent with how other employees with excessive absenteeism were treated, and to determine whether Plaintiff was attempting to unilaterally change her job schedule. (Doc. 64, pp. 24-25.) The Court finds that these suffice to meet Defendant's burden here.
Because Defendant articulated nondiscriminatory, nonretaliatory reasons for its actions, Plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the proffered reasons are pretextual. Batson, 897 F.3d at 1329. This can be done by "presenting evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision." Id. (quoting Martin, 543 F.3d at 1268); see also Jackson v. Ala. State Tenure Comm'n, 405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir. 2005) (stating that a plaintiff may show pretext by pointing to "weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions" in the employer's proffered reasons). The plaintiff "must meet that reason head on and rebut it." See Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir. 2000). "[C]onclusory allegations of discrimination, without more, are not sufficient [*28]  to raise an inference of pretext . . . where [an employer] has offered . . . extensive evidence of legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions." Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., 101 F.3d 1371, 1376 (11th Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). Further, "a reason cannot be proved to be 'pretext for discrimination' unless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason." St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993).
At best, Plaintiff's evidence of pretext is scant. For instance, Plaintiff argues that Defendant's heightened scrutiny of her accommodation request is evidence of retaliation. (Doc. 66, p. 15.) Putting aside Plaintiff's failure to define the "heightened scrutiny" she supposedly experienced, Plaintiff has offered no evidence that Defendant improperly evaluated her accommodation request or the limited documentation in support thereof.27 See supra Section III.B (finding Defendant properly requested additional information in assessing Plaintiff's accommodation request). Next, Plaintiff contends that Defendant's claim that her promotion was impossible is pretextual (Doc. 66, p. 17), but Defendant never said she was not promoted because it was impossible—the position she wanted did not exist and Plaintiff's job performance did not warrant a reclassification [*29]  or her requested raise. (See Doc. 64-2, ¶¶ 10-11; Doc. 65-3, pp. 47-56; Doc. 64-3, ¶¶2-8.) Last, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's claim that it needed to enforce rules against Plaintiff by seeking notes from her providers to support her leave requests is pretextual as Defendant did not have the right to request those notes and she was providing proper notice of her scheduled leave.28 (Doc. 66, p. 17.) But Plaintiff has failed to provide evidence of her compliance with the rules or to counter Defendant's evidence that others with excessive absences were treated the same way. (See Doc. 64-5, ¶¶ 3-4; Doc. 65-3, p. 37; Doc. 64-2, ¶ 13; Doc. 65-6, pp. 45:21-46:10.) At bottom, Plaintiff has provided little more than unsupported assertions of pretext and has not met any of Defendant's proffered assertions head on and rebutted them. See Mayfield, 101 F.3d at 1376; Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1030.
With that, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not even shown Defendant's proffered reasons for any of the alleged adverse actions were false, and she remains a far cry from showing the real reason was discrimination. See St. Mary's Honor Ctr., 509 U.S. at 515. As no reasonable jury could conclude otherwise, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the retaliation claims. See [*30]  Batson, 897 F.3d at 1329.29
