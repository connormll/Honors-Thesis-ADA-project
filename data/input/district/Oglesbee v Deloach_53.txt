Opinion



ORDER
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant's Case Dispositive Motion for Summary Judgment and Supporting Memorandum of Law (Doc. 19; Motion), Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 29; Cross-motion), and Defendant's Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Cross-motion (Doc. 31; Opposition). The Court also considers Defendant's Motion to Strike Portions of Affidavit of Michael Oglesbee and Exhibit 6 to Plaintiff's Cross-Motion (Doc. 32; Motion to Strike), and Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Strike (Doc. 33; Opposition to Motion to Strike).
On June 21, 2017, Plaintiff Michael Oglesbee ("Plaintiff" or "Mr. Oglesbee") filed the Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (Doc. 8; Amended Complaint) involving [*2]  alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (the "ADA"), and the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Section 760.10 et seq. Florida Statutes (the "FCRA") against Defendant Gator Deloach, in his official capacity as the Sheriff for Putnam County, Florida ("Defendant" or "Sheriffs Office"). Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 5-7.1 The Amended Complaint includes the following two counts against Defendant: Count I: Disability Discrimination in Violation of the ADA and the FCRA; and Count II: Retaliation in Violation of the ADA and the FCRA. Id. ¶¶ 37-48. Plaintiff's claims surround his employment with the Putnam County Sheriff's Office in a variety of positions including the chief bailiff position. See id. ¶¶ 1, 8. The Court will first address Defendant's Motion to Strike to set the factual basis then proceed to the parties' motions for summary judgment.

I. Motion to Strike
Defendant moves to strike portions of Plaintiff's Affidavit (Doc. 29-2; Oglesbee's Affidavit), and the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Letter of Determination (Doc. 29-6; EEOC Letter), which were both submitted in support of Plaintiff's Cross-Motion. See Motion to Strike at 2-10. The Court has broad [*3]  discretion when considering a motion to strike. See Saunders v. Emory Healthcare, Inc., 360 F. App'x 110, 112 (11th Cir. 2010). Generally, courts in the Eleventh Circuit "allow[ ] 'otherwise admissible evidence to be submitted in inadmissible form at the summary judgment stage, though at trial it must be submitted in admissible form.'" Kimbrough v. City of Cocoa, No. 605CV471ORL31KRS, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64180, 2006 WL 8439593, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 7, 2006) (quoting McMillian v. Johnson, 88 F.3d 1573, 1584 (11th Cir. 1996), affd sub nom. McMillian v. Monroe Cty., Ala., 520 U.S. 781, 117 S. Ct. 1734, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1997)). Thus, the Court will not strike evidence at the summary judgment stage if it is likely that the evidence will be available in an admissible form at trial. See Kimbrough, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64180, 2006 WL 8439593 at *1.
Regarding Oglesbee's Affidavit, Defendant argues that numerous statements in the Affidavit contradict Plaintiff's deposition testimony and are based on nothing more than Plaintiff's subjective beliefs. See Motion to Strike at 1-7 (moving to strike the following 12 paragraphs from Oglesbee's 28-paragraph Affidavit: 4, 5, 7-9, 11, 18, 22-25, and 28). Defendant also argues that the EEOC Letter would likely be inadmissible at trial because it is conclusory in nature and contains issues of trustworthiness. See id. at 2, 8-10.
Plaintiff argues that the Court should deny Defendant's Motion to Strike arguing that (1) Oglesbee's Affidavit contains consistent statements in an admissible form of evidence at trial based [*4]  on his personal knowledge and (2) that the EEOC Letter should be considered with the rest of the evidence in the record in that the Letter is not determinative and EEOC letters are generally admissible at trial. See generally Opp. to Motion to Strike 2-8.
Initially, the Court notes that the EEOC Letter is highly probative and likely to be admitted at trial. See e.g., Barfield v. Orange Cty., 911 F.2d 644, 649 (11th Cir. 1990) ("EEOC reports and findings have been held to be admissible evidence and 'highly probative.'"). Oglesbee Affidavit is also likely to be available in admissible form at trial through Plaintiff's personal knowledge. For purposes of this Order, the Motion to Strike is due to be denied.
While the Court considers Oglesbee's Affidavit in its entirety, it also finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact. In paragraph six of Oglesbee's Affidavit, Plaintiff states that "[i]n June 2007 as a result of being diagnosed with idiopathic cardiomyopathy I requested from Sherriff Dean Kelly to be reassigned to the position of Chief Bailiff." Plaintiff testified during his deposition that in 2007 he verbally requested that Sheriff Kelly transfer him from the school resource unit sergeant to the chief bailiff position. (Doc. 21-1 [*5]  at 47:3-15; Deposition of Oglesbee). Plaintiff testified that this request was in a verbal "passing type situation" where Plaintiff did not explicitly mention his heart condition to Sheriff Kelly. See id. at 47:3-15. Regardless, there is no dispute that the Sheriff's Office was aware of Plaintiff's heart condition. See id.; (see also Doc. 19-2 ¶ 5; Affidavit of Deloach) ("Prior to November 2012, the Putnam County Sheriffs Office had knowledge that Michael Oglesbee suffered from heart disease/hypertension, but had no record or knowledge of any ongoing work restrictions."). There is also no dispute that in June 2007, Plaintiff had no medical restrictions. See Oglesbee Depo. at 56:9-23, 65:16-20.
In paragraph seven of Oglesbee's Affidavit, Plaintiff concludes that Sheriff Kelly understood Plaintiff's request to be transferred to the chief bailiff position as a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA in light of his heart condition. See Oglesbee Aff. ¶ 7. However, Sheriff Kelly stated under oath that Plaintiff's transfer to the chief bailiff position was "based solely on [Plaintiff's] fraternization with the married female staff at the schools." (Doc. 31-2 ¶¶ 2-3; Kelly Affidavit). [*6]  For purposes of this Order, there remains no dispute that the Sheriff's Office knew of Plaintiff's heart condition, but that Plaintiff had no medical restrictions at this time.

II. Summary Judgment Standard of Law
Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, "[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P 56(a). The record to be considered on a motion for summary judgment may include "depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). An issue is genuine when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the non-movant. See Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., 93 F.3d 739, 742 (11th Cir. 1996) (quoting Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Publ'g Co., 9 F.3d 913, 919 (11th Cir. 1993)). "[A] mere scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party's position is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment." Kesinger ex rel. Estate of Kesinger v. Herrington, 381 F.3d 1243, 1247 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)).
The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating to the Court, by reference to the record, that there are no genuine issues of material fact to be determined at trial. See Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991). "When a moving party has discharged [*7]  its burden, the non-moving party must then go beyond the pleadings, and by its own affidavits, or by depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Jeffery v. Sarasota White Sox, Inc., 64 F.3d 590, 593-94 (11th Cir. 1995) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Substantive law determines the materiality of facts, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. In determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, a court "must view all evidence and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment." Haves v. City of Miami, 52 F.3d 918, 921 (11th Cir. 1995) (citing Dibrell Bros. Int'l, S.A. v. Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro, 38 F.3d 1571, 1578 (11th Cir. 1994)).

III. Background
On October 7, 1991, Plaintiff was hired to work at the Putnam County Sheriff's Office ("Sheriff's Office") as a deputy sheriff. Oglesbee Depo. at 20:9-10, 23-25, Ex. 1. As a deputy sheriff, Plaintiff's duties included patrolling the streets and enforcing the laws. Id. at 21:10-14, Ex. 2 (Deputy Sheriff Job Description) (stating that the major function of a deputy sheriff is the "[r]esponsible work of a general public safety nature, with primary emphasis on the protection of life and property and the [*8]  enforcement of laws[.]"). His duties also included "the ability to make arrests and exercise law enforcement authority." Deloach Aff. ¶ 12; see also Deputy Sheriff Job Description at 1 (including as illustrative duties that the deputy sheriffs enforce laws, make arrests, and transport or escort prisoners).
On November 1, 1995, Plaintiff was promoted to a sergeant position. Oglesbee Depo. at Ex. 3. As a sergeant, Plaintiff was required to be a sworn law enforcement officer and meet the minimum qualifications of a sergeant and a deputy sheriff. Deloach Aff. ¶ 11; see also Oglesbee Depo. at Ex. 4 at 1 (Sergeant Job Description) (stating that the minimum qualifications for a sergeant include four years as a deputy sheriff and the illustrative duties include instructing, assigning, and supervising the subordinate deputies); (see also Doc. 29-7 at 13:8-14:9; Sheriff's Office Corporate Representative Deposition ("If you're in a sworn position . . . if you carry a gun and you're certified by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as a law enforcement officer, or corrections, . . . your underlying base duties are always going to be a deputy sheriff . . . .")). On July 15, 2002, Plaintiff was transferred to the school resource [*9]  unit still working as sergeant. Oglesbee Depo. at 32:12-16, 33:19-21, Ex. 5.
During Plaintiff's time at the Sheriff's Office, he was involved in the Sergeant's Union for the Putnam County Sheriff's Office ("Union") and served as the Union's president. Oglesbee Aff. ¶ 10; see also Oglesbee Depo. at 43:23-44:9 (where Plaintiff testified that he was the Union president). Through the Union, Plaintiff "was consistently active in attempting to collectively bargain for all of the [s]ergeant's[,] . . . was responsible for the advocation of changes in benefits, pay or work conditions for all the sergeant's[,] . . . [and] was oftentimes in contentious discussions with the Sherriff." Oglesbee Aff. ¶ 10.
In 2007, Dean Kelly was the Sheriff of Putnam County. See Oglesbee Depo. at 45:24-46:11; see also Oglesbee Aff. ¶ 6 (indicating that Dean Kelly was the Sheriff in 2007). On May 4, 2007, while Plaintiff was still working as a school resource unit sergeant, he filed a worker's compensation claim related to a "heart disease condition." Oglesbee Depo. at Ex. 8 (emphasis omitted). The heart disease condition was discovered when Plaintiff went to a doctor for a medical release to undergo knee surgery. [*10]  Id. at 48:11-15, 51:6-53:18, Ex. 7-9. During the consultation, it was discovered that Plaintiff had an abnormal EKG and needed further testing. See id. 51:16-52:15, Ex. 9.2 Thereafter, Plaintiff underwent a heart catheterization procedure performed by cardiologist Dr. Ferris George. See id. at 52:6-53:22, Ex. 9. Dr. George diagnosed Plaintiff with idiopathic cardiomyopathy. See id. at 59:24-60:3, Ex. 9. Plaintiff was prescribed medication and ultimately cleared for the knee surgery. See id. at 55:5-8, 56:24-57:1, Ex. 9. As a result of Plaintiff's heart condition and knee surgery, Plaintiff missed work from May 4, 2007 through June 21, 2007. See id. at 55:1-4, 56:18-23, Ex. 7, 8. When Plaintiff returned to work in June 2007 as a sergeant in the school resource unit, he returned with no medical or other restrictions. See id. at 56:9-23, 65:16-20.
On June 25, 2007, upon Plaintiff's verbal request to Sheriff Kelly, Plaintiff was transferred from the school resource unit sergeant to the patrol division as chief bailiff. See id. at 46:21-47:9, 65:16-20, Ex. 6. As chief bailiff, Plaintiff supervised eight to ten deputy sheriffs and several armed security officers. See id. at 34:23-35:9, [*11]  Ex. 12 (Chief Bailiff Job Description) (including as illustrative duties that a chief bailiff supervises and assigns work to bailiffs and coordinates personnel to insure coverage of courts). Plaintiff's duties also included escorting prisoners and required Plaintiff to have the "[a]bility to maintain control and safeguard prisoners individually or in groups [and] . . . maintain order in courtrooms during the course of trials." Chief Bailiff Job Description at 1.
As chief bailiff, Plaintiff carried a firearm and a taser on his person and had arrest power. See Oglesbee Depo. at 79:21-80:4, 84:12-14. Plaintiff drove a marked patrol vehicle to and from the courthouse, Id. at 42:9-18. During his time as chief bailiff, Plaintiff pursued a defendant outside of the courthouse who was acting belligerent with a judge. See id. at 137:1-138:16. Plaintiff pursued the defendant and tackled him to the ground on his own and then two other officers assisted Plaintiff with placing the defendant under arrest. See id. at 137:1-138:22. Plaintiff worked as chief bailiff from June 2007 through November 2012. See id. at 66:13-16, 139:8-25.
In 2008, Jeff Hardy was elected as the Sheriff of Putnam County and in 2012 he was reelected. See id. [*12]  at 46:2-11; see also Oglesbee Aff. ¶ 11 ("By November 2012, Sheriff Hardy was in office and had just won re-election."). During the 2012 reelection, Plaintiff campaigned for Sheriff Hardy's opponent. See Oglesbee Aff. ¶ 11. On March 8, 2012, Plaintiff was placed on medical leave pending the results of testing relating to his heart condition. See Oglesbee Depo. at 131:17-133:1, Ex. 17. On March 14, 2012, Plaintiff returned to work as chief bailiff "with no restrictions." See id. at 133:13-135:8, Ex. 18. Plaintiff worked as chief bailiff with no restrictions until November 2012. See id. at 66:13-16, 139:8-25.
On November 9, 2012, after Sheriff Hardy was reelected, Major Gary Bowling notified Plaintiff that he would be transferred from chief bailiff to road patrol effective on November 24, 2012. See id. at 140:3-25, Ex. 19. The transfer "would have been a lateral transfer from sergeant to sergeant" with no loss of pay. Id. at 140:17-22. Plaintiff refused the transfer by explaining to Major Bowling that Plaintiff's doctor would not permit him to work on road patrol. See id. at 141:18-21. Thereafter, on November 13, 2012, Plaintiff's worker's compensation attorney sent a letter to the Sheriffs Office, explaining the following: (1) that Plaintiff's doctor "restricted him from regular patrol duties" and that the transfer would place Plaintiff "and the citizens of [the] County at risk should he suffer from a cardiac event of some kind;" and (2) that the transfer was in retaliation for Plaintiff's filing of a worker's compensation claim. See id. at 147:14-148:6, Ex. 20. Two days later, on November 15, 2012, the Sheriffs Office responded by letter submitting Plaintiff to a "fitness for duty examination" "[b]ased on the concerns brought [*13]  forth by" Plaintiff's November 13, 2012 letter from his attorney. See id. at 148:7-25, Ex. 21.
The Sheriff's Office placed Plaintiff on paid administrative leave effective November 15, 2012 pending the results of Plaintiff's fitness for duty examination. See id. at 151:8-16, Ex. 21. Also on November 15, 2012, the Sheriffs Office sent Plaintiff a letter to provide to a doctor of Plaintiff's choice explaining that Plaintiff is required "to submit to a fitness for duty evaluation to determine if he can meet the demands of his position." See id. at 151:24-152:5, Ex. 22. The letter to Plaintiff's doctor included the job descriptions for Sergeant and Deputy Sheriff. See id. at 152:6-10, Ex. 22.
On November 20, 2012, Dr. George, Plaintiff's doctor of choice, made the following evaluation of Plaintiff:
Patient has moderate to severe cardiomyopathy. Patient's ejection fraction is 34% by muga scan of 3/8/2012. In my opinion patient is at risk of cardiac event during encounters or physical altercations requiring takedowns. Patient should remain on light active duty or comparable to current position.
See id. at 162:6-16, Ex. 24 (Dr. George's Evaluation). On November 27, 2012, the Sheriff's Office [*14]  sent a letter to Plaintiff stating that based on Dr. George's Evaluation that Plaintiff was "at risk of a cardiac event during encounters or physical altercations requiring takedowns," Plaintiff was "not capable of performing the essential functions of a Deputy Sheriff/Sergeant." See id. at 175:10-13, Ex. 25 (Reassignment Letter). As a result, the Sheriffs Office offered to reassign Plaintiff to a communications officer position. See Reassignment Letter at 1.
A communications officer is a "dispatcher" who is not a sworn law enforcement officer and does not have arrest power. See Oglesbee Depo. at 176:2-177:3. The communications officers do not carry firearms and do not wear law enforcement uniforms. See id. at 176:5-18. While the communications officers are not required to hold a Florida Department of Law Enforcement ("FDLE") certification, they are required to undergo training and receive a certification. See id. at 176:19-24. The reassignment from chief bailiff to communications officer would have resulted in a salary decrease, loss of benefits, and a demotion. See id. at 175:14-16; see also Oglesbee Aff. ¶ 19 (where Plaintiff states that he "was offered a non-sworn communications dispatcher position, which [*15]  was half of [his] current pay, loss of benefits and a demotion.").
On December 6, 2012, Plaintiff denied the reassignment offer to the communications officer position, filed a grievance against the Sheriff's Office, and then on December 10, 2012 participated in a meeting with the Sheriff's Office. See Oglesbee Depo. at 177:11-180:18, Ex. 26, 27, 28. Plaintiff requested a transfer back to the chief bailiff position, or to a sergeant maintenance position in the jail or an evidence custodian position. See id. at 181:4-9, 25-182:2, 185:5-11, Ex. 28. As of November 27, 2012, the evidence custodian position was vacant. See Oglesbee Aff. ¶ 21. The Sheriffs Office denied Plaintiff's request because the requested positions were "sworn positions which may require use of force to restrain an inmate or defend [himself] or another officer, for which [Plaintiff] would not be qualified due to [his] medical condition." See Oglesbee Depo. at 189:21-190:1, Ex. 29. Effective December 12, 2012, Plaintiff's employment with the Sheriffs Office terminated. See id. at 190:2-8.
On January 10, 2013, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). See Plaintiff's [*16]  Cross-motion at Ex. 5 (EEOC Complaint). In its Letter of Determination (Doc. 29-6; EEOC Letter), the EEOC found that the Sheriff's Office violated the ADA. See EEOC Letter at 2.

IV. Discussion

a. Disability Discrimination under the ADA and the FCRA (Count I)

i. Legal Standard
The ADA "prohibits employers from discriminating against 'a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees . . . and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.'" Frazier-White v. Gee, No. 8:13-CV-1854-T-36TBM, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48923, 2015 WL 1648551, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 14, 2015), aff'd, 818 F.3d 1249 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). Likewise, the FCRA prohibits employment discrimination based on an individual's handicap. See Frazier-White, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48923, 2015 WL 1648551 at *5; see also Fla. Stat. § 760.10(1)(b)(2) (making it unlawful for an employer to "discriminate against, any individual because of . . . handicap . . . ."). "Disability discrimination claims under the FCRA are analyzed under the ADA." Frazier-White, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48923, 2015 WL 1648551 at *5; see also Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263-64 (11th Cir. 2007) ("Claims raised under the Florida law are analyzed under the same framework as the ADA."); Wimberly v. Sec. Tech. Grp., Inc., 866 So. 2d 146, 147 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004) ("Because Florida courts construe the FCRA in conformity with the ADA, a disability discrimination cause of action is analyzed under the ADA.").
To pursue an ADA claim, a plaintiff may "proceed on theories of [*17]  intentional discrimination, disparate treatment, or failure to make reasonable accommodations." Rylee v. Chapman, 316 F. App'x 901, 906 (11th Cir. 2009). Discrimination under the ADA includes
not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity[.]
42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To establish a prima facie claim for the failure to accommodate, "the plaintiff must show that: (1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) he was discriminated against by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." McKane v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., 363 F. App'x 679, 681 (11th Cir. 2010). Where a plaintiff proceeds on the theory of a failure to make reasonable accommodations, "the defendant's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered until the plaintiff makes a 'specific demand' for an accommodation." Id.
An ADA discrimination claim alleging failure to make a reasonable accommodation is not analyzed under the McDonnell Douglas3 burden-shifting analysis. Frazier-White, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48923, 2015 WL 1648551 at *7 (citing Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *9 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007) (unpublished)). Rather, the plaintiff is required to show that he is a qualified [*18]  individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA and that the defendant-employer has not provided a reasonable accommodation. See Frazier-White, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48923, 2015 WL 1648551 at *7 (quoting Nadler, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705 at *9). "Upon such a showing, the defendant may then establish the affirmative defense of undue hardship." Id. (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)).
A qualified individual with a disability under the ADA is "'an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds.'" McKane, 363 F. App'x at 681 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). In other words, the plaintiff must demonstrate "'either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation.'" Id. (quoting Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000)). If the plaintiff is unable to perform an essential function of his job, even with an accommodation, he is not a qualified individual and thus not covered under the ADA. McKane, 363 F. App'x at 681 (quoting Davis, 205 F.3d at 1305).
The ADA does not require defendant-employers to eliminate essential functions of a plaintiff's job. See id. Whether a function is essential is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The ADA provides that "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what [*19]  functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). The ADA regulations state that a function may be considered essential "because the reason the position exists is to perform that function[.]" 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i). The regulations also provide that evidence of whether a function is essential may include the following:
(i) The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential;
(ii) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job;
(iii) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function;
(iv) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function;
(v) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement;
(vi) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or
(vii) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)(i)-(vii).
An accommodation is reasonable when it "enables the employee to perform an essential function of the job." McKane, 363 F. App'x at 681 (citing Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255). A reasonable accommodation may include the following:
(A) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible [*20]  to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and
(B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(9); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)-(4). The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the essential functions of the job. See McKane, 363 F. App'x at 681. "An employee with a disability is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation." Id.

ii. Analysis
The parties disagree on whether Plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA. Plaintiff argues that he is a qualified individual because his "idiopathic cardiomyopathy—without treatment—would substantially limit the operation of his cardiovascular system." See Cross-motion at 9 (citing Oglesbee Aff. ¶ 3). Plaintiff argues that his condition is a disability under the ADA because it is a physical impairment that limits one or more life activities including the [*21]  operation of a major bodily function such as the circulatory and cardiovascular functions. Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102(1)(A), (2)(B), 12102(4)(E)(i); 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(i)(1)(ii)).
On the other hand, Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual because his heart condition is not a disability under the ADA. See Motion at 11 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)).4 Defendant also argues that at the time of Plaintiff's termination in 2012, he could not perform the essential functions of a sworn law enforcement officer. See Motion at 12-14.

1. Qualified Individual with a Disability
There is no dispute that Plaintiff was diagnosed with idiopathic cardiomyopathy. On November 20, 2012, Dr. George opined that Plaintiff was "at risk of cardiac event during encounters or physical altercations requiring takedowns" and that Plaintiff "should remain on light active duty or comparable to current position." To determine whether Plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA, the Court must first determine whether encounters or physical altercations requiring takedowns are essential functions of the chief bailiff position. If so, then the Court must determine whether Plaintiff was able to perform the essential functions with or without a reasonable accommodation.
According to Defendant's judgment as the employer, an essential function of sworn law enforcement officers including [*23]  chief bailiffs is to be able to make arrests, which may require encounters and physical altercations requiring takedowns. See Motion at 18-19; see also Deloach Aff. ¶ 12 ("The minimum job requirements of a chief bailiff, sergeant, and deputy sheriff include the ability to make arrests and exercise law enforcement authority."). The Chief Bailiff Job Description provides that a major function is to escort prisoners and maintain order in the court. See Chief Bailiff Job Description ("Major Function"). Plaintiff also testified that on at least one occasion he physically pursued a belligerent defendant out of the courthouse and alone took the defendant to the ground to be placed under arrest. See Oglesbee Depo. at 137:1-138:22.
There is no dispute that Plaintiff engaged in physical encounters less frequently as a chief bailiff than on road patrol. See Oglesbee Aff. ¶¶ 9, 18. Despite the infrequency that Plaintiff was required to engage in physical encounters and takedowns as the chief bailiff, the reason that the chief bailiff position exists is to provide security to the courthouse and exercise arrest powers when necessary. See Oglesbee Depo. at 113:7-115:5 (where Plaintiff testified that [*24]  as chief bailiff, if there was a threat to the courthouse he would act and respond to the threat and not simply direct other subordinates to respond to the threat); see also Deloach Aff. ¶¶ 10, 17 ("As the chief bailiff, Oglesbee was required to be a sworn law enforcement officer and meet the minimum requirements of a chief bailiff, sergeant, and deputy sheriff."). Every deputy sheriff, regardless of experience or title, is required to be able to take law enforcement action and effectuate arrests. See Oglesbee Depo. at 22:4-23; see also Deloach Aff. ¶ 12 ("The minimum job requirements of a chief bailiff, sergeant, and deputy sheriff include the ability to make arrests and exercise law enforcement authority."). Simply because the chief bailiff position requires less day-to-day physical encounters that would have put Plaintiff at risk of a cardiac event does not mean that the function was not essential to the position.
Moreover, the consequences of not requiring Plaintiff as chief bailiff to provide security to the courthouse and to exercise his arrest powers as needed, including encounters or physical altercations requiring takedowns, could have extremely detrimental effects on the judicial [*25]  system and the public. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)(iv) (permitting the Court to consider the consequences of not requiring Plaintiff to perform a certain function). Not only would Plaintiff's life be at risk if he was required to perform in the chief bailiff position with his heart condition, but the other officers, defendants, courthouse personnel, and the public would also be at serious risk of harm. A reasonable juror could not find that permitting Plaintiff as a sworn law enforcement officer to refrain from encounters and physical altercations requiring takedowns would not have grave consequences. As a result, encounters or physical altercations requiring takedowns are essential function of the sworn officer positions including the chief bailiff position.
Next, the Court considers whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions with a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff's doctor prohibited him from duties that required encounters or physical altercations requiring takedowns. See Dr. George's Eval. In other words, Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of the chief bailiff position without an accommodation. The only accommodation that would have permitted Plaintiff to continue working [*26]  as a sworn law enforcement officer was to assign him to a position that did not require him to engage in any encounters or physical altercations requiring takedowns. See Dr. George's Eval. Indeed, Dr. George recommended that Plaintiff remain in his current position or something comparable. See Dr. George's Eval. However, the chief bailiff position would indisputably require Plaintiff to engage in activity that Dr. George opined would Plaintiff at risk of a cardiac event. See id.; see also Deloach Aff. ¶ 17 ("Based on Dr. George's assessment, the Sheriffs Office determined that Oglesbee was not capable performing the essential functions of the job of a deputy sheriff and sergeant, including but not limited to the ability to make arrests and exercise law enforcement authority.").5
The vacant evidence custodian position that Plaintiff requested is also a sworn law enforcement position that would have required Plaintiff to carry a firearm, meet the minimum qualifications of a deputy sheriff, including the ability to make arrests and exercise law enforcement authority. See Deloach Aff. ¶ 25; see also Sheriff's Office Corp. Rep. Depo. at 47:9-50:30, Ex. 10 (stating that an evidence custodian [*27]  is a deputy sheriff, carries a firearm, and gets called out to active crimes scenes); Oglesbee Depo. at 187:15-189:16 (describing that the evidence custodian gets called out to crimes scenes and has the same arrest power as chief bailiff). Similar to the chief bailiff position, simply because the evidence custodian does not frequently engage in physical encounters or make arrests does not mean that the functions are not required. Rather, even as an evidence custodian Plaintiff would have the same responsibilities as other armed sworn law enforcement officers and would be required to engage in physical encounters as necessary albeit infrequently.
Likewise, the sergeant maintenance position that Plaintiff requested would have required Plaintiff to be a sworn corrections officer, which he was not. See Oglesbee Depo. at 185:5-186:14. The sergeant maintenance position would have also required Plaintiff to work in a jail to supervise inmates. See id. at 186:11-23; see also Deloach Aff. ¶ 26 ("Oglesbee was not qualified to be transferred to the position of sergeant maintenance supervisor in the jail because he was not a sworn corrections officer and had no training or experience working in [*28]  the jail or any correctional facility.").
Plaintiff fails to show that his requested accommodations—allowing him to work as the chief bailiff, evidence custodian, or a sergeant maintenance supervisor—were reasonable. On this record, a sworn position that does not require encounters or physical altercations requiring takedowns does not exist. See Deloach Aff. ¶¶ 10-12, 17, 20, 22, 25-26. In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of his job without accommodations, and there were no reasonable accommodations that would have allowed Plaintiff to remain working as a sworn law enforcement officer with arrest power. Plaintiff is therefore not a qualified disabled individual and thus not covered under the ADA.6

2. Reasonable Accommodation
Even if Plaintiff was a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA, Plaintiff failed to show that Defendant has not provided a reasonable accommodation. Under the ADA, reasonable accommodations may include reassignments to vacant positions for which the individual is qualified. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12111(9); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1256 ("The reassignment duty . . . does [*29]  not require the employer to bump another employee from a position in order to accommodate a disabled employee . . . [n]or does it require the employer to promote a disabled employee." (internal quotations and citations omitted)). Based on Dr. George's Evaluation, Defendant offered to place Plaintiff in a non-sworn communications position. See Deloach Aff. ¶ 18.7 The communications position did not require Plaintiff to make arrests, exercise law enforcement authority, or carry a firearm. See id.; see also Oglesbee Depo. at 175:10-177:10 (where Plaintiff testified that the communications position was offered to him, was a non-sworn position, and would not have required him to carry a firearm or exercise arrest power).
Accordingly, Plaintiff has not presented evidence that he is a qualified individual within the meaning of the ADA. The Court also finds that Defendant's offered accommodation was reasonable. Defendant's Motion is therefore due to be granted as to Plaintiff's discrimination claims in Count I and Plaintiff's Cross-motion is due to be denied.

b. Retaliation under the ADA and the FCRA (Count II)
The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because [*30]  such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [the ADA]." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). "Courts assess ADA and FCRA retaliation claims under the same framework as retaliation claims arising under Title VII." Russell v. City of Tampa, Fla., No. 8:16-CV-912-T-30JSS, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140759, 2017 WL 3782861, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 31, 2017), aff'd, 737 F. App'x 922 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing Harper v. Blockbuster Entm't Corp., 139 F.3d 1385, 1389 (11th Cir. 1998); Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge. Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997)). Accordingly, ADA retaliation claims are assessed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. See Russell, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140759, 2017 WL 3782861 at *5 (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)). Under this framework, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation, which consists of the following elements: that "(1) he engaged in a statutorily protected expression; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the adverse action and his protected expression." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260.
The first element may be satisfied by a request for a reasonable accommodation. See Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258 (internal citation omitted). The third element "can be met by showing close temporal proximity between the statutorily protected activity and the adverse employment action." Thomas v. Cooper Lighting. Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007). However, "mere temporal proximity, without more, must be 'very [*31]  close.'" Id. The third element also "requires a showing of but-for causation." Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258; see also Russell, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140759, 2017 WL 3782861 at *5 (The plaintiff "has the ultimate burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence 'that the legitimate reasons offered by the employer for taking the adverse action were pretexts for unlawful retaliation, and that the plaintiff's protected activity was the "but-for" cause of the adverse action."' (quoting Mealing v. Georgia Dep't of Juvenile Justice, 564 F. App'x 421, 427 (11th Cir. 2014)); Univ. of Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013)).
Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the defendant-employer then has an opportunity to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. See Pennington v. City of Huntsville, 261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir. 2001) (internal citation omitted). If the defendant-employer "presents a legitimate explanation for its actions, the burden then returns to the plaintiff to show that the explanation is pretextual." Russell, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140759, 2017 WL 3782861 at *5 (citing Pennington, 261 F.3d at 1266).
Plaintiff argues that he first asserted his rights under the ADA in 2007 by requesting a reasonable accommodation through Sheriff Kelly to transfer Plaintiff from the school resource unit sergeant to the chief bailiff position. See Cross-motion at 16-17; see also Oglesbee Aff. ¶¶ 6-7 ("In June 2007 as a result of being diagnosed with idiopathic cardiomyopathy I requested from Sherriff Dean Kelly to be reassigned [*32]  to the position of Chief Bailiff . . . . Sherriff Dean Kelly understood this to be a request for a reasonable accommodation, under the [ADA]."). Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, even if Sheriff Kelly transferred Plaintiff in 2007 as a reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff failed to establish that the protected activity under the ADA was the but-for cause of Plaintiff's termination.8
Plaintiff argues that in addition to his heart condition, he was also terminated in retaliation for serving as the president of the Union and for filing a worker's compensation claim. See Cross-motion at 16-17; see also Oglesbee Depo. at 153:11-16, 154:7-156:13 ("I believe there was a target on my back . . . they were looking for a way to get rid of me because I represented the [U]nion."). Plaintiff also states that Sheriff Hardy "did not like" him because Plaintiff campaigned for Sheriff Hardy's opponent during the 2012 reelection and that Sheriff Hardy "wanted to dismantle" the Union. Oglesbee Aff. ¶ 11.
Moreover, the transfer in 2007 was not in close proximity to Plaintiff's termination in 2012. See e.g., Thomas, 506 F.3d at 1364 ("A three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse [*33]  employment action is not enough."). Between 2007 and 2012, Plaintiff's heart condition changed, and Dr. George placed medical restrictions on Plaintiff. Thus, even if the 2007 transfer was a reasonable accommodation that Defendant unlawfully revoked in 2012, Defendant presented a legitimate explanation for its actions—that Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of a sworn law enforcement officer position with or without a reasonable accommodation. The facts interpreted in a light most favorable to Plaintiff preclude Plaintiff's retaliation claim regarding the 2007 transfer. See Sims v. MVM, Inc., 704 F.3d 1327, 1335-36 (11th Cir. 2013) (A "'but-for' cause requires a closer link than mere proximate causation; it requires that the proscribed animus have a determinative influence on the employer's adverse decision.").
Additionally, Plaintiff's requests to be transferred back to the chief bailiff position, or to be transferred to the evidence custodian position or to the sergeant maintenance position also fail as a basis for Plaintiff's retaliation claims. These requests occurred in 2012 after Plaintiff was transferred to road patrol and thus could not have been denied in retaliation to Plaintiff's requests.
In light of the foregoing, [*34]  a reasonable juror could not find that Defendant terminated Plaintiff in retaliation for either the 2007 transfer or the other requests in 2012. Defendant's Motion is therefore due to be granted as to Plaintiff's retaliation claims in Count II and Plaintiff's Cross-motion is due to be denied.
Accordingly, after due consideration, it is
ORDERED:
1. Defendant's Motion to Strike Portions of Affidavit of Michael Oglesbee and Exhibit 6 to Plaintiff's Cross-Motion (Doc. 32) is DENIED.
2. Defendant's Case Dispositive Motion for Summary Judgment and Supporting Memorandum of Law (Doc. 19) is GRANTED.
3. Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 29) is DENIED.
4. The Clerk of the Court is directed to DISMISS with prejudice Plaintiff Michael Oglesbee's claims against Defendant Gator Deloach, in his official capacity as the Sheriff for Putnam County, Florida, TERMINATE any pending motions, and CLOSE this file.
DONE and ORDERED in Jacksonville, Florida this 24th day of January, 2019.
