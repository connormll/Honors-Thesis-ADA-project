Opinion



ORDER
Weldon Williams sued his former employer, Revco Discount Drug Centers, Inc. d/b/a CVS Pharmacy, Inc., for allegedly violating, inter alia, the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Doc. 1; see also doc. 13. Revco has since moved for summary judgment, doc. 24, and it has been through one round of briefing. Docs. 29, 30, 31 & 37. Weldon moves for leave to file a reply brief, doc. 38, even though the Court long ago authorized parties to file as many reply briefs as they want whenever they want. Podger v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., 212 F.R.D. 609, 609 (S.D. Ga. 2003); see also S.D. Ga. LR 7.6 (authorizing reply briefs but imposing notice requirements and time limits).
What Williams really wants is for the Court to abstain from ruling until he  [*2] can get another brief filed. Doc. 38 at 1 ("Plaintiff request[s] this Court allow Plaintiff to file a Surreply within 10 days of the Order granting same."). Revco opposes. Doc. 39. The motion (doc. 38) is DENIED because the Podger rule applies — Williams is free to file as many briefs as he wants — and Williams shows no good cause to delay consideration of a fully briefed summary judgment motion. The parties are subject to the "sudden death" aspect of the Podger rule — they risk a ruling ahead of any brief they might file. That is incentive enough to say what they want to say, and say it now.
SO ORDERED, this 7th day of August, 2012.
