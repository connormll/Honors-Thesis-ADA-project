Opinion



ORDER
Before the Court are Defendant BNSF Railway Company's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion") (ECF No. 35), Brief in Support ("Brief") (ECF No. 36), and Appendix in Support (Defendant's Appendix) (ECF No. 37), filed on July 31, 2019; Plaintiff Jay Weber's Response (ECF No. 40) and Brief in Support ("Response") (ECF No. 41), filed August 21, 2019; and Defendant's Reply ("Reply") (ECF No. 43), filed September 4, 2019. Having reviewed the Motion, related briefing, and applicable law, the Court finds that Defendant's Motion should be and is hereby GRANTED in part as to Weber's disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and Federal Railroad Safety Act (FRSA) claims. Weber's Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) claim is set for oral argument before this Court on December 10, 2019 at 2:00 pm in the 3rd floor Jury [*2]  Assembly Room.

I. BACKGROUND
The following factual recitation is primarily taken from Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, Defendant's Appendix, and Plaintiff's Response Brief. The Court addresses the claims alleged in the Amended Complaint, except those conceded by Plaintiff. Weber began his employment with BNSF as a train dispatcher in 1989 until his termination on May 18, 2016. Amended Compl. 2, ECF No. 14. Weber suffered a seizure as a result of a brain neoplasm on April 15, 2015, which required inpatient care at UT Parkland through his release on April 23, 2015, when he was permitted to conduct administrative and educational duties not around heavy equipment. Id. Weber was placed on a medical leave of absence from April 20, 2015 through July 20, 2015 by Defendant BNSF. Id. This medical leave of absence exhausted his entire FMLA bank of hours. Id.
After returning to work as a train dispatcher, Weber was required to attend office visits with his doctor, which BNSF required him to attend in order to remain medically qualified for his position. Id. at 2. Weber's doctor advised him to avoid triggering events that create a risk of seizure—which included getting less than four hours of sleep. [*3]  Id. Weber discussed his need for accommodations with his supervisors including: Sterling Barker - Director of Scheduling; Tanner Wyatt - Corridor Superintendent; Gilbert Lemen - Scheduler; and Bobby Pechal - General Director of Scheduling. Id. See also Def.'s App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Weber Depo Excerpts) 12, 55, 107, 112-13, 133-34, ECF No. 37.
BNSF charged Weber with excessive absenteeism on February 16, 2016—for absences that occurred on January 20 and 29, 2016—on March 19, 2016—for an absence that occurred on February 9, 2016—and on April 18, 2016—for absences that occurred on March 4 and 11, 2016. Id. Hearings were held subsequent to each charge. Id. At each hearing Weber was found guilty of excessive absenteeism. Id. Weber requested reassignment and medical leave of absences, which were denied, upon his return to work as a train dispatcher. Id. Weber was subsequently terminated on May 18, 2016. Id. at 2, 3-4.
BNSF's attendance guidelines state that,
absenteeism is considered excessive when an individual's incidents of absenteeism disrupts the regular working schedule of dispatchers in their assigned office . . . An incident of absenteeism means any non-recognized absence from work including, [*4]  but not limited to, laying off sick without justifiable reason, pattern layoffs, sporadic absences, tardiness or leaving work early, etc. Absences due to medical leave, vacation, bereavement leave, military leave, personal leave, COMP time and jury duty are not considered 'incidents' in the evaluation of employee absenteeism . . . The employee will receive counseling from his or her supervisor when excess absenteeism becomes apparent. . . . Should an employee fail to improve, a second meeting with the supervisor will be held. . . . Subsequent failure to achieve regular, punctual attendance by the employee will result in progressive discipline.
Def.'s App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Decl. of Jacquinet) 319, ECF No. 37. Additionally, the collective bargaining agreement between BNSF and Weber requires BNSF to conduct investigations before issuing discipline for attendance issues. Id. at 301; see also Def.'s App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Weber Depo. Excerpts) 93-95, ECF No. 37. Weber was disciplined multiple times from 2004 to 2013, and received three coaching and counselling letters, four formal reprimands, and a ten-day suspension due to his repeated violations of the attendance guidelines. Def.'s App. Supp. [*5]  Mot. Summ. J. (Decl. of Jacquinet) 322-23, ECF No. 37. Weber had the second highest amount of unexcused absences for the "last rolling 12 months" as of the month of January 2016. Id. at 322.
When a train dispatcher does not show up for work, BNSF utilizes its extra board to fill vacancies as they occur. Def.'s App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Pechal Depo. Excerpts) 263, ECF No. 37. The extra board is intended to make up for the vacancy left when a dispatcher is not at work, but there are not always enough dispatchers on the extra board to cover all of the vacant positions; and when there are more vacancies than extra board dispatchers, BNSF must combine desks for a shift. Id. at 266.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

A. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 - Motion for Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings and evidence on file show "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "[T]he substantive law will identify which facts are material." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A genuine dispute as to any material fact exists "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. The movant makes a showing that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact [*6]  by informing the court of the basis of its motion and by identifying the portions of the record which reveal there are no genuine material fact issues. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "The party opposing summary judgment is required to identify specific evidence in the record and to articulate the precise manner in which that evidence supports his or her claim." Diaz v. Kaplan Higher Educ., L.L.C., 820 F.3d 172, 176 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Ragas v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co., 136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir. 1998)) (internal quotations and emphasis omitted).
When reviewing the evidence on a motion for summary judgment, the Court must resolve all reasonable doubts and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant. See Walker v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 853 F.2d 355, 358 (5th Cir. 1988). The Court cannot make a credibility determination in light of conflicting evidence or competing inferences. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. As long as there appears to be some support for the disputed allegations such that "reasonable minds could differ as to the import of the evidence," the motion for summary judgment must be denied. Id. at 250.

III. ANALYSIS

A. Disability-Discrimination Claim
Weber has withdrawn his claim of disability discrimination under the ADAAA and Rehabilitation Act. Pl.'s Resp. 1, ECF No. 40. Therefore, BNSF's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Weber's claim of disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act, as [*7]  amended (ADAAA), the Rehabilitation Act, and corresponding state claims is GRANTED.

B. Failure to Accommodate Claims
Weber maintains his claim of denial of reasonable accommodations—in 2015 for reassignment under the Rehabilitation Act and in 2016 for denial of medical leave under the ADAA, Rehabilitation Act and Texas Human Rights Act (THRA). Pl.'s Resp. 1, ECF No. 40.1
"Under the ADA, it is unlawful for an employer to fail to accommodate the known limitations of an employee's disability." Credeur v. La. Office of Att'y Gen., 860 F.3d 785, 792 (5th Cir. 2017) (quoting Griffin v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 661 F.3d 216, 224 (5th Cir. 2011)) (internal quotations omitted). "A prima facie claim for failure to accommodate requires that: (1) the plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) the disability and its consequential limitations were known by the covered employer; and (3) the employer failed to make reasonable accommodations for such known limitations." Clark v. Charter Commc'ns, L.L.C., 775 F. App'x. 764, 766-67 (5th Cir. 2019); Credeur, 661 F.3d 224 (quoting Neely v. PSEG Tex., Ltd. P'ship, 735 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir. 2013)) (internal quotations omitted); Grant v. Harris County,   794F. App'x352   2019 WL 5618164, at *5 (5th Cir. Oct. 30, 2019). If the Court finds Weber to be a qualified individual, it must then determine whether BNSF failed to make reasonable accommodation for his disability; however, if the Court finds Weber is not a qualified individual, no further inquiry is necessary. Credeur, 860 F.3d 792. "To avoid summary judgment on whether he is a qualified individual, [*8]  [Weber] needs to show 1) that he could perform the essential functions of the job in spite of his disability or 2) that a reasonable accommodation of his disability would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of the job." Turco v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 101 F.3d 1090, 1093 (5th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted); see also Nall v. BNSF Ry. Co., 917 F.3d 335, 342 (5th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).
For purposes of summary judgment, Defendant concedes that Weber has a statutory disability. Def.'s Br. 24, ECF No. 36. Because the inquiry is not solely whether Weber was disabled, but rather whether he was a qualified individual with a disability, the Court addresses whether Weber was a qualified individual. A "qualified individual" is someone who, "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "To be 'qualified' under the ADA, [Weber] must be able to 'perform the essential functions' [of a dispatcher] 'with or without reasonable accommodation.'" Credeur, 860 F.3d 792 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)).
"Essential functions are fundamental, as opposed to marginal, job duties, . . . such that a job is fundamentally altered if an essential function is removed." Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8), 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1), 29 C.F.R. § Pt. 1630, App.) (internal quotations omitted). "Fact-finders [*9]  must determine whether a function is essential on a case-by-case basis." Id. (quoting E.E.O.C. v. LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 698 (5th Cir. 2014)) (internal quotations omitted). This inquiry should begin by considering "the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Additionally, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") promulgated regulations listing seven non-exhaustive factors to guide the essential-function inquiry:
(i) The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential;
(ii) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job;
(iii) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function;
(iv) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function;
(v) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement;
(vi) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or
(vii) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3). "Both the statute and regulations indicate that [the Court] must give greatest weight to the 'employer's judgment.' It [*10]  is the only evidence the statute requires [the Court] to consider, absent a written job description." Credeur, 860 F.3d 792 (emphasis in original). The Court, however, "should not give blind deference to an employer's judgment, but should instead evaluate the employer's words alongside its policies and practices." Id. at 794 (citing E.E.O.C. v. Ford Motor Co., 782 F.3d 753, 765-66 (6th Cir. 2015)). Further, it is not a reasonable accommodation "to require the employer to eliminate essential job functions, modify job duties, reassign existing employees, or hire new employees." Toronka v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 411 F. App'x 719, 724 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, 174 F.3d 615, 621 (5th Cir. 1999)).
BNSF moves for summary judgment on, among other things, Weber's reasonable accommodation claims contending that "Weber was not a qualified individual, which is an essential element of a failure-to-accommodate claim." Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 30. BNSF supports this contention by citing to Weber's statement that he could only work as a dispatcher if BNSF allowed him to "go to the follow-up doctor appointments . . . and [] would've needed to have been able to be off . . . for triggering events . . . [which] could be anytime [he] receive[d] less than four hours sleep per night." Def.'s App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Weber Depo. Excerpts), 24, ECF 37. BNSF alleges that this accommodation is fatal to Weber's [*11]  failure to accommodate "claim because regular and predictable attendance is an essential function of a dispatcher." Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 25 (citing Def.'s App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Decl. of Mr. Pechal) 233 ("Due to the 24/7 nature of train traffic, regular and reliable attendance at work is an essential job duty of a dispatcher.")), ECF No. 35.
The Court considers the summary judgment evidence using the relevant EEOC factors listed above.2 As to the first factor, the employer's judgment as to which functions are essential, Mr. Bobby Pechal worked as the General Director of Transportation Support for BNSF during the time at issue, and his duties included "ensuring that all dispatchers were treated fairly and consistently under BNSF's attendance guidelines." Def.'s App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Decl. of Pechal) 232, ECF No. 37. In Mr. Pechal's judgment, "regular and reliable attendance at work is an essential job duty of a dispatcher." Id. at 233. BNSF also has an attendance policy where a dispatcher's absence constitutes an "incident" when it is a "non-recognized absence from work including, but not limited to, laying off sick without justifiable reason, pattern layoffs, sporadic absences, tardiness [*12]  or leaving work early, etc." Id. at 319. BNSF's policy dictates that once a dispatcher shows "excess absenteeism" the "employee will receive counseling from his or her supervisor" and further states that "[s]ubsequent failure to achieve regular, punctual attendance by the employee will result in progressive discipline." Id.
Considering the fourth factor—the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform his duties—when a dispatcher does not show up for work, BNSF has an "extra board" in place to "fill vacancies as they occur." Id. at 263. While this extra board is intended to make up for a dispatcher not attending work on any given day, there are not always enough people on the extra board to cover all vacant dispatcher positions; when there are more vacancies than there are extra board dispatchers to make up for them, BNSF then must combine desks for a shift which causes a dispatcher to cover double the territory they should be working. Id. at 266. This means that when a dispatcher is absent, and there are not enough extra board dispatchers to cover that dispatcher's position, the trains still run, but not efficiently and it impacts the work group. Id. at 266-67.
Finally, considering the fifth factor, the terms of the [*13]  collective bargaining agreement between BNSF and Weber required BNSF to conduct "investigations before issuing attendance-related discipline," which it did. Id. at 301; see also Def.'s App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Weber Depo. Excerpts) 93-95, ECF No. 37. As to the seventh factor, comparing this instance to the experience of others, the undisputed facts show of the other 683 dispatchers, Weber had the second highest number of unexcused layoffs for the month of January 2016. Id. at 98, 205.
The evidence, in conjunction with the regulations and extensive case law stating that "regular work-site attendance is an essential function of most jobs,"3 raises no dispute of fact that regular and reliable attendance at work is an essential function of a dispatcher and, further, that Weber was unable to perform that function with or without reasonable accommodation. Weber's request for intermittent leave would not allow him to regularly and reliably attend work as a dispatcher. Because Weber was unable to perform the essential functions of a dispatcher with or without reasonable accommodations, Weber was not a qualified individual as required by the ADA.
Weber appears to argue that attendance was not an essential function [*14]  and that intermittent leave may be a reasonable accommodation that would allow Weber to perform the essential functions of a dispatcher. Weber relies on Carmona v. Southwest Airlines Company where the Fifth Circuit found that there was reason to doubt that attendance was an essential job function because the employer granted frequent leave. 604 F.3d 848, 859-60 (5th Cir. 2010). Weber contends that this case is similar because "BNSF granted managerial leniency numerous times but then 'fast-tracked' his discipline by charging him three months in a row." Pl.'s Resp. Br. 11, ECF No. 41.
In Carmona, the employer's attendance policy "was extremely lenient" and because the attendance for the plaintiff's position was so flexible, attendance was not an essential function of the plaintiff's position. 604 F.3d at 859. Southwest's attendance policy stands in stark contrast to BNSF's attendance policy, which provided any non-recognized absence constituted an "incident" and each incident results in some form of discipline. Def.'s App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Decl. of Jacquinet), 319, ECF No. 37. This distinction is indicative of the essential nature of attendance in the position of a dispatcher, as intermittent leave as a reasonable accommodation would [*15]  preclude an individual from performing the essential functions of the job.
Based on the foregoing, no further inquiry need be made regarding Weber's other ADA complaints. Accordingly, BNSF's motion for summary judgment on Weber's reasonable accommodation claims is GRANTED, and Weber's reasonable accommodation claims are DISMISSED.

C. FMLA Claims
Weber has withdrawn his claim of FMLA retaliation but maintains his claim of interference with prospective rights under the FMLA. Pl.'s Resp. Br. 1, ECF No. 40. The FMLA allows eligible employees "to take reasonable leave for medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition." Elsensohn v. St. Tammany Par. Sheriff's Office, 530 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2601(b)(2)). An employer may not "interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise" any right provided under the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). This provision creates a claim for interference in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his rights under the FMLA. To establish a prima facie interference case, Weber must show that "(1) he was an eligible employee; (2) his employer was subject to FMLA requirements; (3) he was entitled to leave; (4) [*16]  he gave proper notice of his intention to take FMLA leave; and (5) his employer denied him the benefits to which he was entitled under the FMLA." DeVoss v. Southwest Airlines Co., 903 F.3d 487, 490 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting Caldwell v. KHOU-TV, 850 F.3d 237, 245 (5th Cir. 2017)) (internal quotations omitted). An interference claim does not require proof of discriminatory intent—Weber must prove only an act of interference. See Cuellar v. Keppel Amfels, LLC, 731 F.3d 342, 350 (5th Cir. 2013). While Weber need not prove intent, he must prove some prejudice as a result of the employer's interference. Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 89, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002).
BNSF seeks summary judgment on Weber's FMLA interference claim, arguing that Weber cannot make out a prima facie case of interference under the FMLA because, at the time his employment ended, "he was not an eligible employee, he was not entitled to any FMLA leave, and he was not denied any leave to which he was entitled." Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 35, ECF No. 35. BNSF further argues that the Fifth Circuit does not recognize this sort of prospective interference claim, and that even if it did, the Fifth Circuit, through Perkins v. Child Care Associates, requires the employee to show that he notified the employer of his intention to take leave.4 And that Weber did not show sufficient notice, but merely "suggest[ed] that he might take intermittent FMLA leave as necessary at some [*17]  unspecified point in the future, and he submitted paperwork requesting to be approved for intermittent FMLA leave to be used at an unspecified time in the future." Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 36, ECF No. 35. Additionally, BNSF argues that Weber "cannot establish that BNSF's stated reason for terminating his employment is pretext, and that BNSF acted with the specific intent to interfere with his rights under the FMLA." Id.
In response, Weber argues that the evidence and inferences show his "intention to take leave" when he formally applied for FMLA leave, was denied, and told he would be eligible on April 21, 2016, when Carole Wilks informed Weber that FMLA could be used for absences related to doctors' appointments and treatment. Pl.'s Resp. Br. 19, ECF No. 41. Further, Weber contends that "[a] reasonable jury conclude [sic] that a high-level supervisor like Mr. Pechal would be unlikely in the normal course of business to inquire when Mr. Weber would be eligible for FMLA leave." Id. at 18. And finally, Weber alleges that Mr. Pechal departed from the regular procedure in evaluating absences—as evidenced by his email stating, "I want to take him every month when he hits. No more skipping."—and knew [*18]  that Weber's absences would be covered by the FMLA, but he does not state any facts to support this inference. Id. at 19.
Weber also argues that Perkins acknowledged that other circuits recognized prospective interference with FMLA. 751 F. App'x at 476. He cites to one of these cases, Erdman v. Nationwide Insurance Company,5 where an employee was terminated before his FMLA was scheduled to begin, and he asserts this case is similar because BNSF fast-tracked his discipline, deviated from BNSF policy, and charged him three months in a row for absences, in order to interfere with his scheduled FMLA eligibility on April 21, 2016. Pl.'s Resp. Br. 19, ECF No. 41; Pl.'s App. Supp. Resp. 184 (McCall Depo. Excerpts), ECF No. 42.
Bearing in mind that the Court cannot make credibility determinations in light of competing inferences,6 and having reviewed the summary judgment record, the Court finds that Weber has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether BNSF "fast-tracked his charges for absenteeism and resulting in progressive discipline" but the Court questions whether this fast track resulted "in interference with FMLA rights." Amended Compl. 2, ECF No. 14, ¶ 34.
While this evidence, and its inferences, viewed in [*19]  favor of Weber may raise a fact issue as to whether BNSF fast-tracked his discipline, the question remains whether it was the fast-track of discipline, or his later termination, that is the basis for his interference claim. This is important because Weber has only alleged that the fast-track of discipline, not termination, interfered with his FMLA rights.
After requesting FMLA leave, Weber does not dispute that he was told on February 14, 2016 that he had no remaining FMLA leave and would not be eligible for additional FMLA leave until April 21, 2016. Nor does Weber contend this recitation was inaccurate. Given the February 14 response was accurate, his response does not explain how this notice interfered with his FMLA leave.
In addition, it appears undisputed that Weber was employed and not terminated until May 2016, such that he was eligible and entitled to FMLA leave by April 21, before he was terminated. Yet, he proffers no information that Defendant interfered with FMLA leave during this time, apart from his contention that fast-tracking his discipline was interference. In other words, he presents no facts indicating he took or sought FMLA leave during this period and was denied [*20]  it by BNSF. Weber does not assert that fast-tracking discipline prevents an eligible and entitled BNSF employee from exercising FMLA leave during that process, or how that process interfered with his exercise or attempt to exercise those rights. Therefore, even if the Fifth Circuit recognizes a prospective interference claim, it is not clear that the evidence demonstrates BNSF interfered with Weber's FMLA leave. To address these questions, the Court sets this for oral argument on December 10, 2019.

D. FRSA Claims
Weber also asserts claims pursuant to the FRSA. In his response, he has withdrawn his FRSA claim under (c)(2), which prohibits employers from disciplining an employee for following a physician's treatment plan. He concedes his FRSA claim "more appropriately fall under the disability discrimination laws that do not draw a distinction between medical conditions during the course of employment." Pl.'s Resp. Br. 19, ECF No. 40. Weber therefore maintains his claim for FRSA violations under section (b) for reporting an unsafe condition. Id. at 1.
Section (b) of the FRSA prohibits railroad carriers from "discharge[ing], demot[ing], suspend[ing], reprimand[ing], or in any other way discriminat[ing] [*21]  against an employee for . . . reporting, in good faith, a hazardous safety or security condition." 49 U.S.C. § 20109. Weber asserts if he has an episode under his medical condition, his working will create a hazard. BNSF moves for summary judgment arguing that this claim fails as a matter of law because § 20109(b)(1)(A) is limited to "work-related" conditions and injuries. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 37-38, ECF No. 35.7 And further, BNSF argues that even if off-duty injuries or illnesses could give rise to an FRSA claim, Weber cannot prove that BNSF terminated his employment because of his doctor's visits or reports that he did not feel safe to work, stating that "if Weber had used his available paid leave days to attend to those matters, he would not have been disciplined." Def. Summ. J. 38, ECF No. 35 (citing Def.'s App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (Decl. of Pechal), 236, ECF No. 37).
In response, Weber contends that he was protected under § 20109(b)(1) because he reported his medical condition and subsequent absences because his medical condition created a hazardous condition. Pl.'s Resp. Br. 20. Additionally, Weber stresses the importance of protecting railroad employees for reporting hazardous conditions by laying out [*22]  the history of the FRSA, and argues—through Third8 and Federal Circuit9 opinions—that the causation question is whether the protected act(s) were a contributing factor in the adverse action, whether alone or in connection with other factors which tend to affect in any way the outcome of the case. Araujo, 708 F.3d 159 (citing Marano, 2 F.3d at 1140). Finally, Weber contends—through Third Circuit10 and Western District of Louisiana11 opinions—that the proximity between the employee's protected activity and the adverse action can be circumstantial evidence that the protected activity was a contributing factor. Weber states that he did not merely mark off "sick" but provided details about his medical condition to his supervisor about his increased risk of seizure when fatigued. Contra Winch v. Dir., OWCP, 725 F. App'x 768, 771 (11th Cir. 2018) (noting that employee only called in "sick" and did not make any statements to notify employer that he was reporting a hazardous condition).
In resolving the issue of whether a non-work related medical infirmity constitutes a hazardous condition under subsection (b), the Court finds persuasive the analysis in Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Secretary, U.S. Dept. of Labor and Williams v. Illinois Central Railroad Company. See 776 F.3d 166; No. 3:16-cv-00838- [*23] CWR-FKB, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92054, 2017 WL 2602996 (S.D. Miss. June 15, 2017) (finding that self-reported illnesses are not covered by 20109(b) because they are covered in other parts of the FRSA and finding that they are also covered by (b) would render the other provisions superfluous.).
In Williams, Judge Reeves confronted a situation similar to that presented here; whether an employee's personal illness was a hazardous condition under the (b)(1) reporting provision. Following standard canons of statutory construction, he concluded that reports of hazardous conditions under (b)(1) applied to those conditions that are within the employer's control and impacted its operation.
When interpreting a statute, it "should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous." Clark v. Rameker, 573 U.S. 122, 131, 134 S. Ct. 2242, 189 L. Ed. 2d 157 (2014). "Judges should hesitate . . . to treat [as surplusage] statutory terms in any setting, and resistance should be heightened when the words describe an element of a criminal offense." Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 145, 116 S. Ct. 501, 133 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1995) (quoting Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 140-41, 114 S. Ct. 655, 126 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1994) (internal quotations omitted)). Finally,
Statutory construction . . . is a holistic endeavor. A provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme-because the same terminology is used elsewhere [*24]  in a context that makes its meaning clear, . . . or because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.
United Savings Ass'n of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Ass'n Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, 371, 108 S. Ct. 626, 98 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1988) (internal citations omitted).
Self-reporting an illness is not mentioned in subsection (b). Williams, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92054, 2017 WL 2602996, at *2. Instead, other provisions deal with self-reporting illness and injury. See (a)(4). Subsection (c)(2) prohibits a railroad carrier from disciplining an employee who requests medical treatment or follows the orders of a treating physician. Reading protection for self-reported infirmities into subsection (b) would make some of the statute's other text superfluous. Williams, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92054, 2017 WL 2602996, at *2. Judge Carlton also noted that in 2008 Congress added § 20109(c)'s protections for following the direction of a physician, therfore concluding that if a self-report was covered by (b)(1), it would make this amendment trivial. Id. at 2.
Based on these authorities, Weber's § 20109(b) claim fails as a matter of law because subsection (b) does not protect an employee who reports an off-duty infirmity as a hazardous condition. Because it is undisputed that Weber's illness was sustained off-duty, § 20109(b) protections do not protect him for reporting his condition. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS BNSF's motion for summary judgment on Weber's FRSA claim and the claim [*25]  is therefore DISMISSED.

E. Back pay and Emotional Distress Claims
Defendant also seeks summary judgement on Weber's back pay and emotional distress claims. Given the disposition of the claims in the previous paragraphs, the Court defers ruling on these claims pending further explanation from the parties on which issues remain.

IV. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Defendant's Motion is granted in part and denied in part. Weber withdraws his claim of disability discrimination, therefore that claim is DISMISSED. The Court GRANTS Defendant BNSF's motion as to Plaintiff Weber's failure to accommodate and FRSA claims, and they are hereby DISMISSED. The Court DEFERS Defendant BNSF's motion as to Weber's back pay and emotional distress claims. Weber's FMLA claim is hereby set for oral argument on December 10, 2019.
SO ORDERED on this 6th day of December, 2019.
