Opinion



Report & Recommendation
The Plaintiff, through counsel, filed this employment action against Georgetown County ("the County") in the Court of Common Pleas for Georgetown County on April 21, 2016. (Dkt. No. 1-1.) The County removed this action on May 19, 2016. (Dkt. No. 1.) Now before the court is the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. (Dkt. No. 22.) The Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment has been fully briefed by both parties. (Dkt. Nos. 22-2, 25, 26.) Pursuant to the provisions of Title 28, United States Code, Section 636(b)(1)(A), and Local Rule 73.02(b)(2)(G), D.S.C., all pretrial matters in employment discrimination cases are referred to a United States Magistrate Judge. For the reasons stated herein, the undersigned recommends that the Defendants' Motion for Summary (Dkt. No. 22) be granted.

Factual Background
The Plaintiff is an African American male over the age of 60. The Plaintiff was employed by Georgetown County in the Parks and [*2]  Recreation Department as a program assistant starting on August 23, 2000. (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 12.) The Plaintiff was disciplined throughout his employment with the County for issues ranging from tardiness to failing to perform parts of his job. (Dkt. Nos. 22-7, 22-8, 22-9, 22-10, 22-11, 22-13, 22-15, 22-16, 22-18, 22-21, 22-22, 22-23, 22-24, 22-25, 22-26, 22-27, 22-28, 22-29, 22-30.) The Plaintiff was disciplined approximately twenty times during his employment. He was twice placed on performance improvement plans. (Dkt. Nos. 22-14, 22-20.) In 2011, the County posted an opening for a community specialist. (Dkt. No. 22-32.) The Plaintiff applied for the position but did not receive an offer. (Dkt. No. 22-31 at 7.)
On January 9, 2015, the Plaintiff was working at the Beck Recreation Center and broke up a fight between two boys. (Dkt. No. 33-2 at 27.) The Plaintiff eventually determined that he had injured his shoulder and required surgery. (Id. at 29.) The Plaintiff went on leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") on March 13, 2015, which was exhausted on June 4, 2015. (Dkt. No. 22-35.) The Plaintiff remained on unpaid leave after the exhaustion of his FMLA leave.
Upon the exhaustion [*3]  of the Plaintiff's FMLA leave, the Plaintiff was responsible for paying for his own health insurance premiums. (Dkt. No. 22-38.) By July 10, 2015, the Plaintiff's health insurance premiums were $999.00 in arrears. (Dkt. No. 22-42.) The Plaintiff was informed by letter dated July 10, 2015, that if his premiums were not brought current by Monday, July 13, 2015, his coverage would be cancelled. (Id.) Following the letter being sent, the Plaintiff and his attorney met with Gregory Troutman, director of administrative services and human resources for the County. (Dkt. No. 22-37.) The Plaintiff retired from the County. (Id.)

Standard of Review
Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment "shall" be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "Facts are 'material' when they might affect the outcome of the case, and a 'genuine issue' exists when the evidence would allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party." The News & Observer Publ'g Co. v. Raleigh-Durham Airport Auth., 597 F.3d 570, 576 (4th Cir. 2010)(citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, "'the nonmoving party's evidence is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in that party's [*4]  favor.'" Id. (quoting Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 552, 119 S. Ct. 1545, 143 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1999)); see also Perini Corp. v. Perini Constr., Inc., 915 F.2d 121, 123-24 (4th Cir. 1990).

Analysis
The Plaintiff brings the following causes of action against Georgetown County:
1. Race Discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C 2000 et seq., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a).1
2. Retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C 2000 et seq., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a).
3. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Workers' Compensation Statute
4. Age Discrimination in Violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
5. Disability Discrimination in Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(Dkt. No. 1-1.)

1) Race Discrimination under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981
Title VII makes it "an unlawful employment practice for an employer to...discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin...." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Section 1981 states that "[a]ll persons...shall have the same right...to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens." 42 U.S.C. § 1981. "The required elements of a prima facie case of employment [*5]  discrimination are the same under Title VII and Section 1981." Bryant v. Bell Atl. Maryland, Inc., 288 F.3d 124, 133 n.7 (4th Cir. 2002) (citing Gairola v. Commonwealth of Va. Dept. of Gen. Servs., 753 F.2d 1281, 1285 (4th Cir.1985)). Racial discrimination claims under Title VII require proof of intentional discrimination, either by direct evidence2 or by the structured procedures set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Diamond v. Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 318 (4th Cir. 2005).
The Supreme Court of the United States articulated a three-part formula for analyzing discrimination cases in McDonnell Douglas. First, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. If a prima facie case is established, a rebuttable presumption is created that the defendant unlawfully discriminated against her. Second, once this presumption has been established, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. Third, if the defendant shows a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions, the burden is then on the plaintiff to come forward with evidence that the defendant's asserted reasons for its actions are a mere pretext for its true discriminatory motives, and that the actions of the defendant were really based on the plaintiff's race. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802-05; Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-56, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981); Conkwright v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 933 F.2d 231, 234-35 (4th Cir. 1991). Despite these shifting burdens of production, a plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of discrimination throughout. [*6]  Texas Dep't of Community Affairs, 450 U.S. at 252-53; see also St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 507, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993).
In order to meet the first prong of the McDonnell Douglas formula and establish a prima facie case of race discrimination under Title VII, the Plaintiff must show (1) that he is a member of a protected class; (2) that he was performing his job satisfactorily; (3) that he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (4) that other employees who were not members of his protected class were treated more favorably, that he was replaced (in the case of a discharge claim) by someone from outside of her protected class, or there is some other evidence giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. Coleman v. Maryland Court of Appeals, 626 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir. 2010), aff'd sub nom. Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland, 566 U.S. 30, 132 S. Ct. 1327, 182 L. Ed. 2d 296 (2012) (citing White v. BFI Waste Servs., LLC, 375 F.3d 288, 295 (4th Cir.2004)).

a) Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
"Before a plaintiff has standing to file suit under Title VII, he must exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a charge with the EEOC." Bryant v. Bell Atl. Maryland, Inc., 288 F.3d 124, 132 (4th Cir. 2002). The Fourth Circuit has characterized the exhaustion of administrative remedies in Title VII claims to be a jurisdictional requirement and subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Agolli v. Office Depot, Inc., 548 F. App'x 871, 875 (4th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1077, 134 S. Ct. 1920, 188 L. Ed. 2d 944 (2014) (citing Balas v. Huntington Ingalls Indus., Inc., 711 F.3d 401, 406 (4th Cir. 2013)). Only acts occurring within the 300 days prior to the filing of the EEOC charge are actionable under Title VII. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). Filing a charge with the EEOC serves the functions of notifying [*7]  the alleged offending party of the claims and allowing that party to voluntarily comply with Title VII in the proceeding before the EEOC. Balas, 711 F.3d at 407. The EEOC charge "serves a vital function in the process of remedying an unlawful employment practice." Id.
The EEOC charge limits the scope of any subsequent Title VII lawsuit to only the allegations contained in the charge. Id. (citing Evans v. Techs. Applications & Serv. Co., 80 F.3d 954, 962-63 (4th Cir.1996)). EEOC charges must be read by courts with the "utmost liberality." Id. at 408 (internal citations and quotations omitted.) However, courts "are not at liberty to read into administrative charges allegations they do not contain." Id. If a party alleging discrimination finds that their EEOC charge is incomplete, the proper recourse is an amended EEOC charge, not federal court. Id. "If the plaintiff's Title VII claims exceed the scope of the EEOC charge and any charges that would naturally have arisen from an investigation thereof, they are procedurally barred." Id. at 407 (internal citations and quotations omitted).
The Plaintiff filed two EEOC charges on June 15, 2015, against Georgetown County Parks and Recreation.3 (Dkt. No. 25-1.) The charge alleged discrimination based on race, sex, age, disability, and a hostile work environment. [*8]  (Id.) The charge stated the following [verbatim]:
I. That I began my employment with the Department in September 2000. That I was considered an exemplary employee. During my employment I received several awards. I was employed with the Employer as a Programmer Assistant.
II. During my employment the Employer has failed to promote me on several occasions. The Employer most recently failed to promote me to Community Specialist in April 2015 and November 2014.
III. That I am qualified for the positions. The Employer failed to post the position and allow for the proper application process.
IV. The individual hired for the April 2015 position was a younger African American Male. The individual hired for the November 2014 position was a younger White Male.
V. During my employment I have suffered from Stenosis. As a result of my medical condition I received a reasonable accommodation.
VI. After receiving the reasonable accommodation I received an on the job injury. When I attempted to return to work the Employer has refused to continue my accommodation. The Employer non-discriminatory reason for failing to continue my accommodation is pretextual.
VII. That the employer has treated me differently [*9]  based on my Age and Race.
VIII. That my employer has treated me differently based on my disability.
IX. That I have been discriminated against on the basis of my race, Age and Disability in violation of State of South Carolina and Federal Laws to include but not limited to the South Carolina Human Affairs laws and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e, Americans' with Disabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
(Dkt. No. 25-1 at 2.)
The Plaintiff has exhausted his administrative remedies only to acts that occurred within 300 days of filing his charge on June 15, 2015, and that are discernable from the charge. Therefore, any acts that are alleged to have occurred before August 19, 2014, are not exhausted and outside of this court's jurisdiction.

b) Prima Facie Case under Title VII and § 1981 for Failure to Promote
The Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie of racial discrimination under Title VII or § 1981 for not being promoted. The Fourth Circuit has held that, in order to make a prima facie case of a discriminatory failure to promote under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) []he is a member of a protected group, (2) there was a specific position for which []he applied, (3) []he was qualified for that [*10]  position, and (4) [his employer] rejected [his] application under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination." McCaskey v. Henry, 461 F. App'x 268, 269-70 (4th Cir. 2012) (quoting Williams v. Giant Food Inc., 370 F.3d 423, 430 (4th Cir.2004)).
The Plaintiff alleged in the Complaint and on his EEOC charge that the County failed to promote him to the position of "community specialist" in April of 2015 and November of 2014 in violation of Title VII and § 1981. (Dkt. No. 1-1 at 5, 8-10; Dkt. No. 25-1.) The County argues that the position of community specialist was not available or posted since February of 2014, which predates 300 days before the EEOC charge was filed. (Dkt. No. 26 at 2; 22-33 at 3.) The County additionally argues that the position of community specialist required a bachelor's degree, which the Plaintiff does not have, and that there is no evidence that the Plaintiff was not promoted under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination. (Dkt. No. 22-2 at 17-20.) There is no dispute that the Plaintiff is African American and therefore a member of a protected group under Title VII.
The parties dispute in their arguments whether or not the position of community specialist was available in November of 2014 or April of 2015 as the Plaintiff stated in his EEOC Charge. The County [*11]  cites to a letter that Gregory Troutman wrote to the EEOC on August 7, 2015, stating that "no community specialist vacancies have existed, been advertised or filled since February, 2014." (Dkt. No. 22-33 at 3.) The court notes that the Plaintiff did not independently allege in his Complaint that he was discriminated against by not being promoted in November of 2014 or April of 2015. The only references in the Complaint to these alleged positions were contained in a recitation of the EEOC charge. (Dkt. No. 1-1 at 4-5.)
The Plaintiff did not provide any testimony in his deposition about the alleged community specialist positions in November of 2014 or April of 2015. The Plaintiff testified during his deposition of two instances where a white male was promoted to community specialist over him. The first instance was the promotion of Hunter Cox, which occurred in 2004. (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 38.) This instance was not alleged in the Complaint or on the Plaintiff's EEOC charge. The second instance involved a man name Matthew. (Id.) The Plaintiff could not recall Matthew's last name. The Plaintiff first testified that Matthew became a community specialist "before Hunter," but then later stated [*12]  that Matthew was "after 2004" and he could not recall the year. (Id.) The Plaintiff was asked if there was "any other basis for your race discrimination claim against the county." (Id.) The Plaintiff responded, "No, I can't remember." (Id.) The Plaintiff agreed to inform his counsel if he remembered any other instances.
The Plaintiff's only argument to support that community specialist positions were available in November of 2014 or April of 2015 is that his EEOC charge stated that they existed.4 (Dkt. No. 25 at 14.) It is well established that a plaintiff's self-serving affidavit is not sufficient to withstand summary judgment. National Enterprises, Inc. v. Barnes, 201 F.3d 331, 335 (4th Cir. 2000). Assuming arguendo that the positions existed, the Plaintiff's argument does not state that he applied for them. He states that they were "not posted." (Dkt. No. 25 at 14.) To the extent these positions existed, the Plaintiff concedes that he did not apply for them. (Dkt. No. 25 at 24.) The Plaintiff contends that he was "not allowed to apply for these positions." (Id.) The Plaintiff provides no evidence to support his contention. The Plaintiff has had the full benefit of discovery in this case. The Plaintiff has had ample opportunity to acquire some documentation [*13]  from the County as to the existence of the positions. The Plaintiff has failed to establish that any available positions existed in November of 2014 or April of 2015 and that he applied for them.
Assuming arguendo that community specialist positions were available in November of 2014 and April of 2015, the Plaintiff has failed to present evidence that he was qualified for the positions. The position of community specialist requires "a Bachelor's degree in Recreation Administration or related field...." (Dkt No. 22-32.) The Plaintiff argues, without any evidence in support, that the County "specifically created requirements to eliminate the Plaintiff being able to accept the position." (Dkt. No. 25 at 24.) The Plaintiff does not have any evidence to support his conspiratorial accusation that the County created job requirements solely to exclude the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has not established that he was qualified to be a community specialist.
The Plaintiff has not presented any other evidence that he was not promoted "under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination." McCaskey, 461 F. App'x at 269-70. The Plaintiff himself alleged in his charge that one of the two positions was filled by an African [*14]  American male. (Dkt. No. 25-1.) The County asserts, and the Plaintiff does not refute, that as of August of 2015, there were six communities specialists employed by the county with three being African American and three being white. (Dkt. No. 22-33.) The Plaintiff has not provided any evidence that he was not promoted because of his race. This court concludes that the Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to support a prima facie case for failure to promote in violation of Title VII or § 1981. The undersigned recommends that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 22) be granted.

c) Prima Facie Case under Title VII and § 1981 for Constructive Discharge
The Plaintiff argues that his retirement was a constructive discharge. To prove constructive discharge, Plaintiff must show that the County deliberately made his working conditions intolerable in order to make him quit. Munday v. Waste Mgmt. of N. Am., Inc., 126 F.3d 239, 244 (4th Cir. 1997). He must prove two elements: (1) the "deliberateness of [the County's] actions;" and (2) the "intolerability of the working conditions." Martin v. Cavalier Hotel Corp., 48 F.3d 1343, 1354 (4th Cir. 1995). "Deliberateness exists only if the actions complained of were intended by the employer as an effort to force plaintiff to quit." Taylor v. Virginia Union Univ., 193 F.3d 219, 237 (4th Cir.1999) (en banc), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1189, 120 S. Ct. 1243, 146 L. Ed. 2d 101 (2000). To establish the intolerability of [*15]  working conditions, a plaintiff "must show working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign." Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 147, 124 S. Ct. 2342, 159 L. Ed. 2d 204 (2004); Scott v. Ameritex Yarn, 72 F. Supp. 2d 587, 594 (D.S.C. 1999). The Fourth Circuit has held that constructive discharge claims must be "strictly cabined" "[b]ecause constructive discharge claims are susceptible to abuse by those who voluntarily leave their employment." Alba v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 198 F. App'x 288, 294 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Honor v. Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Inc., 383 F.3d 180, 187 (4th Cir. 2004)).
The Plaintiff argues that he was satisfactorily performing his job duties and was then given "no option" by being told he could retire or be terminated. (Dkt. No. 25 at 25.) The Plaintiff testified that he decided to go on retirement instead of being fired because he wanted to keep his health insurance. (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 35.) Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff and accepting his arguments on their face, the Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence to support a constructive discharge claim. See Williams v. Giant Food Inc., 370 F.3d 423, 434 (4th Cir. 2004) (holding that plaintiff's allegations "that her supervisors yelled at her, told her she was a poor manager and gave her poor evaluations, chastised her in front of customers, and once required her to work with an injured back" were insufficient to support a constructive discharge claim); Burns v. AAF—McQuay, Inc., 96 F.3d 728, 733-34 (4th Cir.1996) (finding [*16]  the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence of constructive discharge where her former supervisor demoted her, harassed and criticized her, and inexplicably threatened to fire her); Alba, 198 Fed. Appx. at 294-95 (finding the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence of intolerable working conditions where the employer forced the plaintiff's son to resign, threatened the plaintiff with loss of certain benefits if he refused to retire, told some of the plaintiff's coworkers that he was going to be terminated, and disconnected the plaintiff's access to the employer's computer system); Mozingo v. S. Fin. Grp., Inc., 520 F. Supp. 2d 733, 735 (D.S.C. 2007) (Plaintiff's belief he would be fired if he did not resign after reporting possible securities fraud insufficient to support a claim for constructive discharge). The Plaintiff's allegation that he retired only because he would otherwise be terminated does not support a constructive discharge claim. This court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to present evidence to support a constructive discharge claim under Title VII.

2) Retaliation under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981
Under Title VII, an employer is forbidden from taking action that discriminates against an employee because that employee has either "opposed any practice made an unlawful [*17]  employment practice by this subchapter" or has "made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). The purpose of this antiretaliation provision is to prevent "an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee's efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act's most basic guarantees." Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 63, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006).
A plaintiff may establish a violation of Title VII's antiretaliation provision either through direct and indirect evidence of retaliatory animus or through the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas discussed supra. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the plaintiff must demonstrate "(1) [he] engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer acted adversely against h[im], and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the asserted adverse action." Hoyle v. Freightliner, LLC, 650 F.3d 321, 337 (4th Cir. 2011) (citing Holland v. Wash. Homes, Inc., 487 F.3d 208, 218 (4th Cir. 2007)).
The County argues that the Plaintiff's retaliation claim fails because it was not exhausted before the EEOC and that the Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case for retaliation and carry his burden under McDonnell Douglas. (Dkt. No. 22-2 at 23-27.) The Plaintiff argues that he suffered an [*18]  adverse employment action when he was given the choice to be fired or to retire. (Dkt. No. 25 at 30.) The Plaintiff argues that the County's failure to return the Plaintiff to work after his medical leave was adverse as well. The Plaintiff argues that these actions were taken to retaliate against the Plaintiff for complaining about racial discrimination. (Id.)
The Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before the EEOC for his retaliation claim. The Plaintiff's EEOC charge did not have "Retaliation" checked to indicate it was a basis for his charge. Examining the narrative portion of the charge, quoted supra, the Plaintiff did not allege that any retaliatory act took place. "[A] failure by the plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies concerning a Title VII claim deprives the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction over the claim." Jones v. Calvert Grp., Ltd., 551 F.3d 297, 300 (4th Cir. 2009). The exhaustion requirements for a Title VII claim include retaliation claims. Sloop v. Mem'l Mission Hosp., Inc., 198 F.3d 147, 149 (4th Cir. 1999). In Nealon v. Stone, 958 F.2d 584 (4th Cir. 1992), the Fourth Circuit carved out a narrow exception to the exhaustion requirements for retaliation claims where a plaintiff was subject to retaliation for filing a claim with the EEOC. See Jones v. Calvert Grp., Ltd., 551 F.3d 297, 301-02 (4th Cir. 2009) (holding that Nealon addressed "whether a plaintiff asserting [*19]  a Title VII claim of retaliation for filing a previous EEOC charge must exhaust administrative remedies before suing in federal court" and that a plaintiff was not required to file a subsequent EEOC charge.) The Nealon exception does not apply to Title VII retaliation claims where a plaintiff "had knowledge of the factual basis for [his] retaliation claim before [he] filed h[is] charge with the EEOC." Tonkin v. Shadow Mgmt., Inc., 605 F. App'x 194 (4th Cir. 2015).
The Plaintiff does not argue that he was retaliated against for filing an EEOC charge. The Plaintiff retired before he filed his EEOC charge, so there is no possibility he was retaliated against after he filed the charge. The Complaint alleged that the Plaintiff "participated in protected activities when he reported racial discrimination, racial harassment, failure to promote, and hostile work environment." (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 82.) The Complaint does not contain any date for when the Plaintiff took part in these activities. During his deposition, the Plaintiff testified as to his complaints about his treatment and not being promoted. (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 38-39.) The Plaintiff testified that he had complained in 2009 about his treatment to his supervisor and had complained to a member of county [*20]  council at an unknown time. (Id.) There is no evidence in the record that the Plaintiff was not fully aware of his retaliation claim when he filed his EEOC charge in June of 2015. Therefore, this court concludes that the district court lacks jurisdiction over the Plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim.
Assuming arguendo that the Plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim was exhausted, the Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case for retaliation. As noted supra, the only instances where the Plaintiff can recall reporting racial discrimination was in 2009 and at an unknown time to a county council member. The Plaintiff's claims that he participated in a protected activity are scant at best and are not close in time to the alleged adverse employment actions in this case. See Dowe v. Total Action Against Poverty in Roanoke Valley, 145 F.3d 653, 657 (4th Cir. 1998) ("A lengthy time lapse between the employer becoming aware of the protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action, as was the case here, negates any inference that a causal connection exists between the two."). Additionally, this court has already found that the Plaintiff has not presented evidence that he applied for a promotion or that he was constructively discharged. Therefore, the Plaintiff [*21]  has failed to demonstrate he was subject to any adverse employment action.
Assuming arguendo that the Plaintiff's retaliation claim was exhausted and the Plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the Plaintiff has failed to show that that retaliation "was the real reason for the [adverse employment action]," Holland v. Wash. Homes, Inc., 487 F.3d 208, 218 (4th Cir.2007). The Plaintiff's burden is "functionally equivalent" with "but-for" causation—i.e. the adverse employment action would not have occurred but-for the employer's retaliation. Foster v. Univ. of Maryland-E. Shore, 787 F.3d 243, 252 (4th Cir. 2015). This court concludes that no reasonable jury could find that the Plaintiff was "forced to retire" in 2015 because he complained of racial discrimination in 2009. There is no evidence of a causal link between these two alleged events. This court concludes that the Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and has not established a prima facie case as to his Title VII retaliation claim. The undersigned recommends that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 22) be granted.

3) Wrongful Termination in Violation of Workers' Compensation Statute
The Plaintiff appears to abandon this claim in his Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Dkt. No. 25 at 30.) The Plaintiff states [*22]  "Pursuant to South Carolina law [sic] the Plaintiff cannot be terminated for filing a workers' compensation action. However, based on the Plaintiff's own testimony [sic] the Plaintiff has no cause of action for Workers' Compensation retaliation because of the Statute of Limitations." (Id.) The Plaintiff's concession is correct. The statute of limitations for filing a claim for workers' compensation retaliation is one year. S.C. Code § 41-1-80. The Plaintiff testified he filed a workers' compensation claim "right after" an accident on January 9, 2014. (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 9.) The County concedes that the Plaintiff appears to have stated the wrong year and that his accident was on January 9, 2015. (Dkt. No. 22-2 at 28.) Regardless of which date is correct, the Plaintiff filed his Complaint on April 21, 2016, well over a year after his accident. (Dkt. No. 1-1.) This court concludes that the Plaintiff's claim for worker's compensation retaliation under S.C. Code § 41-1-80 is barred by the statute of limitations. The undersigned recommends that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 22) be granted.

4) Age Discrimination
The Complaint contains a claim which is identified as a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment [*23]  Act ("ADEA"). (Dkt. No. 1-1 at 14-15.) However, the entire body of the cause of action, spanning over 7 paragraphs, refers exclusively to "Terminix" as the defendant. (Id.) The paragraphs refer to "Larry Parker" and "John Stroman." (Id.) These individuals do not appear anywhere else in the record before the court and do not work for the County. (Dkt. No. 22-2 at 2 n.3.) Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Rule 8 "does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A complaint must "state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face" to survive a motion to dismiss. Id. A "complaint's factual allegations must allow a 'court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.'" McCleary-Evans v. Maryland Dep't of Transp., State Highway Admin., 780 F.3d 582, 585 (4th Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 1162, 194 L. Ed. 2d 176 (2016) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). "The complaint must provide enough specificity to 'give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is.'" Pringle v. City of Charleston Police Dep't, No. 2:06-cv-3295-PMD, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103748, 2007 WL 295629, at *5 (D.S.C. Jan. 29, 2007) (quoting Leatherman v. Tarrant Cnty. Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168, 113 S. Ct. 1160, 122 L. Ed. 2d 517, (1993) (internal quotation omitted)).
During his deposition, the Plaintiff was asked, "Are you alleging a claim [*24]  of age discrimination against Georgetown?" (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 39.) The Plaintiff responded "No." (Id.) The Plaintiff was then asked to clarify, and he replied "No. I didn't say anything about my age, But as you see, I'm 62, will be 63 in January." (Id.)
Despite the Complaint's total lack of allegations under the ADEA against the County and the Plaintiff's unequivocal statement that he was not making an age discrimination claim, the Plaintiff's attorney argues that the "Plaintiff met all the requirements of the law and was discriminated against based on his age" without any elaboration. (Dkt. No. 25 at 31.) The Plaintiff's argument is a mere regurgitation of the elements of a prima facie case under the ADEA. (Id.) The Plaintiff's argument does not contain a single reference to the record and is wholly conclusory. This court concludes that the Plaintiff has not stated a claim under the ADEA and has abandoned any claim he attempted to make. The undersigned recommends that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 22) be granted.

5) Disability Discrimination
The Complaint alleges the County failed to accommodate the Plaintiff's disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities [*25]  Act ("ADA"). (Dkt. No. 1-1 at 15-17.) The County argues that the Plaintiff abandoned this claim during his deposition. During the Plaintiff's deposition, he clearly and unequivocally stated that he was not pursuing a claim for disability discrimination against the County. The Plaintiff's deposition contained the following exchange:
Q. To the right is says "Do you have a disability?"
A. Okay. I said no.
Q. You checked No?
A. Right.
Q. Are you alleging a disability claim in this lawsuit against Georgetown County?
A. I didn't do that.
Q. You didn't do—
A. I didn't do a claim for disability.
Q. You are not suing Georgetown County for disability?
A. No.
(Dkt. No. 22-3 at 37.) Later in the deposition, the Plaintiff was again asked to clarify if he was "pursuing a claim of disability." (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 39.) The Plaintiff replied, "No. I didn't claim disability." (Id.) The Plaintiff's attorney did not object to this testimony or clarify the testimony. The Plaintiff now argues that he is not an attorney and did not know what law applied to his case. (Dkt. No. 25 at 31.) A plaintiff's "admissions during litigation are binding." Lightner v. City of Wilmington, N.C., 545 F.3d 260, 264 (4th Cir. 2008). However, Lightner did not specifically discuss deposition testimony. Other [*26]  courts have held that finding that a Plaintiff abandoned a claim through deposition testimony is improper. McGuire v. Bourbon Cmty. Hosp., No. 04-cv-480-KSF, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95696, 2006 WL 208826, at *3 (E.D. Ky. Jan. 25, 2006) ("The plaintiff's testimony may reflect her personal opinion as to why she was terminated, but the legal issue of whether a claim has been abandoned or waived requires much more than a lay person's opinion.). Therefore the court analyzes the Plaintiff's ADA claim on its merits.
The burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), applies to claims under the ADA. Ennis v. National Ass'n of Business and Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 58 (4th Cir.1995). The Plaintiff brings a failure to accommodate claim and a wrongful termination claim under the ADA. (Dkt. No. 1-1 at 15-17.) The Plaintiff alleges that he was injured on the job and requested reasonable accommodation because of the results of the injury. (Id.) The Plaintiff alleges that the County refused to accommodate him. (Id.) The Plaintiff alleges that he was not promoted because of his disability and loss of his position. (Id.) The County argues that the Plaintiff's ADA claim fails because he has not established a prima facie case of disability discrimination (Dkt. No. 26.) The County conceded for the sake of argument that the Plaintiff has a disability within the meaning of the ADA. [*27]  (Dkt. No. 26 at 8.)

a) Failure to Accommodate
Violations of the ADA occur when the employer fails to make reasonable accommodations for a qualified individual with a disability. Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n. 11 (4th Cir.2001). "In a failure to accommodate case, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing '(1) that he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of his disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the position ...; and (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations.'" Rhoads, 257 F.3d at 387 n. 11 (quoting Mitchell v. Washingtonville Ctr. Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 1, 6 (2d Cir.1999)).
There is evidence in the record that the County had notice of the Plaintiff's disability. The Plaintiff injured his shoulder while working for the County. (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 29.) The Plaintiff told his supervisor of the injury and filed a worker's compensation claim with human resources. (Id. at 29-30.) On April 15, 2015, May 28, 2015, and June 8, 2015, the Plaintiff's doctor provided the County with a work status update. (Dkt. No. 22-34, 22-36, 22-39.) The Plaintiff has established that the County had notice of his disability.
The Plaintiff's doctor's reports indicate the Plaintiff was first cleared to go back to work [*28]  on June 5, 2016, in a report dated May 28, 2015. (Dkt. No. 22-36 at 2.) The report stated that the Plaintiff could not drive while taking pain medication, could not lift more than one pound, was limited to sedentary duty, and could not reach overhead. (Id.) The Plaintiff testified that he met with Mr. Troutman at the end of May 2015, and that Mr. Troutman told the Plaintiff that he could drive a minibus for senior citizens if his doctor removed the driving restrictions. (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 34.) The Plaintiff received another report from his doctor dated June 8, 2015, which stated the Plaintiff could return to work that day, removed the necessity of sedentary duty and modified the Plaintiff's driving restriction to not driving on narcotic painkillers.5 (Dkt No. 22-39.) The Plaintiff's doctor indicated that the Plaintiff could drive on ibuprofen. (Id.) The Plaintiff testified that he then found out that his FMLA leave had expired and that his job had been filled.6 (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 34-35.) The Plaintiff testified that he met with Mr. Troutman again to discuss his job being filled and he was given the choice to retire or be terminated. (Id.)
"The ADA does not require that the employer go [*29]  out of his way to provide an accommodation for a disabled employee, but only requires that accommodations are 'reasonable.'" Schneider v. Giant of Maryland, LLC, 389 F. App'x 263, 271 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing Vande Zande v. State of Wis. Dep't of Admin., 44 F.3d 538, 542 (7th Cir.1995) ("To 'accommodate' a disability is to make some change that will enable the disabled person to work ... [and] at the very least, the cost could not be disproportionate to the benefit.")). The Plaintiff does not put forth any evidence to support that he could return to his position with the County and perform his position with reasonable accommodations. The Plaintiff merely argues "the Defendant failed to accommodate the Plaintiff." (Dkt. No. 25 at 34.) The Plaintiff does not cite to any evidence to support his contention. The Plaintiff does not assert and provide any evidence that he could return to his position.
Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, he qualified as disabled under the ADA and the County was aware of his disability. The Plaintiff's FMLA leave began on March 13, 2015 and was exhausted on June 4, 2015. (Dkt. No. 22-35.) The Plaintiff was cleared to work on June 5, 2015, with restrictions that would not allow him to work in any available job. When the Plaintiff was cleared to perform more work on June 8, 2016, the [*30]  Plaintiff's former position was no longer available because his FMLA leave had been exhausted.7 While the timing of the Plaintiff's circumstances is unfortunate, they do not show that the County violated the ADA. There is no evidence that the Plaintiff could return to his former position with accommodations or that the County failed to accommodate the Plaintiff. This court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to present evidence that he could return to his position with reasonable accommodations or that the County refused to make reasonable accommodation.

b) Discharge in Violation of the ADA
To survive summary judgment on an ADA employment claim and establish a prima facie case for discharge in violation of the ADA, a plaintiff is required to produce evidence sufficient to demonstrate the following elements:
(1) he was a qualified individual with a disability;
(2) he was discharged;
(3) he was fulfilling his employer's legitimate expectations at the time of discharge; and
(4) the circumstances of his discharge raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.
Reynolds v. Am. Nat. Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 150 (4th Cir. 2012) (citing Rohan v. Networks Presentations LLC, 375 F.3d 266, 273 n. 9 (4th Cir.2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Evidence of all four of these elements is necessary to survive summary judgment." [*31]  Id.
As discussed supra, the Plaintiff failed to put forth evidence that he was constructively discharged. The Plaintiff testified that he retired to keep his health benefits. (Dkt. No. 22-3 at 35.) The Plaintiff has failed to show he was discharged by the County.
To survive summary judgment on whether he was fulfilling the legitimate expectations of his employer, the Plaintiff must "present...probative evidence that he was, in fact, performing at a level that met [his] employer's legitimate expectations." Hill v. Se. Freight Lines, Inc., 877 F. Supp. 2d 375, 391 (M.D.N.C. 2012), aff'd, 523 F. App'x 213 (4th Cir. 2013). When determining whether an employee is meeting her employer's legitimate expectations, courts do not sit as a "superpersonnel department weighing the prudence of employment decisions." Id. at 385 (quoting Anderson v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 406 F.3d 248, 272 (4th Cir. 2005). "[I]t is the perception of the decision maker which is relevant, not the self-assessment of the plaintiff," when determining whether an employee was performing at a level that met the employer's legitimate expectations. Id. at 386.
The County notes that the Plaintiff had a long history of disciplinary infractions at work dating back to 2001. (Dkt. Nos. 22-7, 22-8, 22-9, 22-10, 22-11, 22-13, 22-15, 22-16, 22-18, 22-21, 22-22, 22-23, 22-24, 22-25, 22-26, 22-27, 22-28, 22-29, 22-30.) The Plaintiff's [*32]  most recent discipline record dated from January 13, 2014, for the Plaintiff's failure to clean an aerobics room for two weeks. (Dkt. No. 22-30.) The Plaintiff has not provided any evidence other than his own self-assessment that he was fulfilling the County's expectations at the time of his retirement. In addition, there is no evidence the Plaintiff was physically able to return to his previous position, and the record shows that his doctor never released him back to work with no limitations. (Dkt No. 22-3 at 35-36.) The Plaintiff has failed to present evidence to establish that he was meeting his employer's legitimate expectations.
A plaintiff must show that his "discharge occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination." Haulbrook v. Michelin North America, 252 F.3d 696, 702 (4th Cir.2001). "To raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination, [a plaintiff] must provide more than speculative evidence, generalities, or gut feelings." Olliff v. Potter, No. 3:08-cv-049, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84402, 2008 WL 4681986, at *4 (E.D. Va. Oct. 21, 2008) (citing Bryant v. Bell Atl., Inc., 288 F.3d 124, 134-35 (4th Cir.2002) (evidence of subjective beliefs "without more, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to any discriminatory conduct.")). As discussed supra, the timing of the Plaintiff' exhaustion of FMLA leave and when [*33]  the Plaintiff's doctor partially lifted his restrictions is unfortunate, but there is no evidence that the County unlawfully discriminated against the Plaintiff because of his disability. The Plaintiff has not cited to any evidence in the record that he was "discharged" because of his disability. (Dkt. No. 25 at 31-34.) Therefore, this court concludes that the Plaintiff' has failed to establish a prima facie case for his ADA claims. The undersigned recommends that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 22) be granted.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, this court recommends that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 22) be GRANTED.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
