Opinion



UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Both Defendants—the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta, Inc. and RCAA Administrative Services, Inc.—filed motions for summary judgment, (Docs. 138; 139), and they also jointly filed a motion for leave to file supplemental materials, (Doc. 165), which are pending before the Court. For the below reasons, the Court DENIES the motion for leave to file supplemental materials. (Doc. 165.) The Court RECOMMENDS that the Archdiocese's motion, (Doc. 138), be DENIED IN PART as to Counts One, Two, Five and Six, and GRANTED IN PART as to Counts Three and Four. The Court further RECOMMENDS that RCAA's motion, (Doc. 139), be DENIED IN PART as to its alternative liability argument, and as to Counts One, [*2]  Two, Five and Six; and GRANTED IN PART as to Counts Three and Four.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff initiated this action on March 9, 2021, naming the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta, Inc. as the only Defendant. (Doc. 1.) Plaintiff later moved to amend her complaint to add two additional parties as Defendants—RCAA Administrative Services, Inc., and the Catholic Foundation of North Georgia—which the Court granted on July 1, 2022. (Docs. 104; 105.) Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the Catholic Foundation of North Georgia on September 6, 2022. (Doc. 122.) The amended complaint, which is the operative complaint, alleges violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 621, et seq. (count 1); violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),1 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., (counts 2-4); and violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq., (counts 5-6.) (Doc. 105 at 14-25.)
The discovery period ended on October 12, 2022. (Doc. 125.) Both Defendants filed summary judgment motions on December 5, 2022. (Docs. 138; 139.) On May 17, 2023, having granted Plaintiff's request, the Court also held an oral argument hearing. (Docs. 162; 163; 166.) Two days later, on May, 19, 2023, Defendants jointly filed a motion for leave to file supplemental materials, seeking to supplement the summary judgment record with a version of the employee [*3]  policy that they assert was the version in effect at the relevant time. (Doc. 165.) Plaintiff filed an opposition response to the motion on June 2, 2023. (Doc. 167.) According to Defendants, the version of the policy attached to their present motion was produced during the course of discovery, (Doc. 165 at 3); yet, though the policy was available, and though they objected to Plaintiff's facts discussing the version of the policy she cited and provided, they did not cite to or provide the document they now present. (PAMF ¶¶48-49; DRPF ¶¶48-49; Doc. 137-3 at 34 (Ex. 197).) Similarly, in reply to Plaintiff's response, Defendants argued that the version of the policy Plaintiff cited was not the correct policy, but they again did not cite to or provide the document they now present. (Docs. 151 at 10; 153 at 2 (incorporating Doc. 151).) Defendants provided no reason for that failure. (Docs. 165). At oral argument, for the first time, Defendants discussed the contents of what they assert is the "current" policy, though they could not definitively answer the Court's questions about the contents, and they conceded that it was not part of the present summary judgment record. (Doc. 166 at 5-8.) [*4]  In response to the Court asking "where is the current policy," Defendants stated that they were "not sure that that was mentioned in either of our statements of material fact," and they "would have to double-check that in terms of the current version that was available at the time." (Doc. 166 at 6, 8.) Defendants seek to supplement the record and provide what they assert is the correct version now, in support of their motions for summary judgment. (Doc. 165). But the Court is not obligated to consider facts or argument raised for the first time at oral argument, and it declines to do so. See Young v. W. Pub. Corp., 724 F. Supp. 2d 1268, 1280 n. 5 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (noting that the court is not obligated to consider arguments raised for the first time at oral argument); see also LR 56.1(A), NDGa (stating that "the parties shall not be permitted to file supplemental briefs and materials, with the exception of a reply by the movant, except upon order of the Court"). Indeed, the Court explained at the oral argument hearing that it would not "entertain any new legal arguments that were not presented in the motions for summary judgment," nor would it "entertain any new facts that were not previously presented in the parties' statement of material facts that were filed along [*5]  with the motions for summary judgment and the responses . . ." (Doc. 166 at 3.) Accordingly, Defendants' joint motion for leave to file supplemental materials, (Doc. 165), is DENIED.2
The summary judgment motions, having now been fully briefed and argued, are ripe for review. (Docs. 138; 139; 145; 146; 151; 153; 166.)

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment shall be granted when the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are the facts that "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law," and accordingly, "the substantive law will identify which facts are material." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); see also Allen v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997) (explaining that "[a]n issue of fact is 'material' if it is a legal element of the claim under the applicable substantive law which might affect the outcome of the case"). "A factual dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Peppers v. Cobb Cnty., Georgia, 835 F.3d 1289, 1295 (11th Cir. 2016) (internal quotations omitted).
The movant carries the initial burden of "informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, [*6]  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact," or the "absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the movant fails to meet this initial burden, then the motion must be denied, and the Court need not consider any showing that the non-movant has made. Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1116 (11th Cir. 1993) (citing Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991)). But if the movant meets the initial burden, the burden then shifts to the non-movant to show that there is indeed a genuine issue of material fact, which precludes summary judgment. Clark, 929 F.2d at 608. The non-movant must "go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, admissions, and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324. "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" in support of the non-movant's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. In other words, when the movant has carried its initial burden under Rule 56(c), the non-movant "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (citations omitted). If the record taken as a whole [*7]  could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-movant, then there is no "genuine issue for trial." Id.
The Court must view the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant only if there is a "genuine" dispute as to those facts. Scott, 550 U.S. at 380; United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop., 941 F.2d 1428, 1437 (11th Cir. 1991) (en banc). To the extent that material facts are genuinely in dispute, the Court must resolve the disputes in the non-movant's favor. Scott, 550 U.S. at 380; Vaughan v. Cox, 343 F.3d 1323, 1326 n.1 (11th Cir. 2003). If the record does not blatantly contradict the non-movant's version of events, the Court must determine whether reasonable jurors could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the non-movant is entitled to a verdict. Scott, 550 U.S. at 380 (when opposing parties tell two different stories, and one is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, then the Court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
"A district court has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence" on a motion for summary judgment. See Hetherington v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 511 F. App'x 909, 911 (11th Cir. 2013) (evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion) (citing Equity Lifestyle Props., Inc. v. Fla. Mowing & Landscape Serv., Inc., 556 F.3d 1232, 1243 (11th Cir.2009)). In determining if evidence is admissible, the Court applies the same rules and standards that would apply [*8]  to admissibility at trial. Munoz v. Int'l All. of Theatrical Stage Emp. & Moving Picture Mach. Operators of U. S. & Canada, 563 F.2d 205, 207 (5th Cir. 1977).3 Generally, inadmissible hearsay cannot be considered on a motion for summary judgment. Macuba v. Deboer, 193 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir. 1999). In Celotex, the Supreme Court held that the nonmoving party is not required to "produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment," which the Eleventh Circuit has interpreted "as simply allowing otherwise admissible evidence to be submitted in inadmissible form at the summary judgment stage, though at trial it must be submitted in admissible form." McMillian v. Johnson, 88 F.3d 1573, 1584 (11th Cir. 1996) (emphasis in original) (citing Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324). For example, a hearsay statement might be admissible because it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule, it does not constitute hearsay at all (because it is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted), or it is used solely for impeachment and not as substantive evidence. Macuba, 193 F.3d at 1323-24. "The most obvious way that hearsay testimony can be reduced to admissible form is to have the hearsay declarant testify directly to the matter at trial." Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, 683 F.3d 1283, 1294 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Pritchard v. S. Co. Servs., 92 F.3d 1130, 1135 (11th Cir. 1996) (an affidavit "can be reduced to admissible form at trial" by having the affiant testify as a witness)). But the possibility that unknown witnesses will emerge to provide testimony, when the record contains [*9]  no such indication, is insufficient to establish that the hearsay statement could be reduced to admissible trial evidence. Jones, 683 F.3d at 1294.
Affidavits and deposition testimony, as required by Rule 56, "must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(4); Macuba, 193 F.3d at 1323 (the rule for affidavits applies to testimony given on deposition); see also Joassin v. Murphy, 661 F. App'x 558, 559 (11th Cir. 2016) (declarations based on personal knowledge are admissible summary judgment evidence); Pritchard, 92 F.3d at 1135. For documents, "[t]o be admissible in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment, a document must be authenticated by and attached to an affidavit that meets the requirements of Rule 56 and the affiant must be a person through whom the exhibits could be admitted into evidence." Barrow v. United States, No. 1:18-CV-5858-CAP, 2021 WL 9720798, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 25, 2021) (alteration omitted) (citing Saunders v. Emory Healthcare, Inc., 360 F. App'x 110, 113 (11th Cir. 2010)). Unsworn statements, on the other hand, do not meet the requirements of Rule 56, and the Court will not consider them. Dudley v. City of Monroeville, Ala., 446 F. App'x 204, 207 (11th Cir. 2011); see also Carr v. Tatangelo, 338 F.3d 1259, 1273 n.26 (11th Cir. 2003) (because the preliminary report submitted was without attestation, it had no probative value and properly was not considered by the district judge in ruling on the summary judgment motions) (citing Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158 n. 17, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970)).

III. STATEMENT OF FACTS
Unless otherwise [*10]  indicated, the Court draws the following facts from Defendants' statements of undisputed material facts, (DSMF, Docs. 138-1 and 139-1); Plaintiff's responses to Defendants' statements of undisputed material facts, (PRDF, Docs. 145-1 and 146-1); Plaintiff's statements of additional material facts, (PAMF, Docs. 145-2 and 146-2); and Defendants' responses to Plaintiff's statements of additional material facts, (DRPF, Docs. 152 and 157.) As indicated, and as needed, the Court may draw some facts directly from the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record".)
The Court deems admitted and accepts as true those facts submitted by either party that: (1) are supported by citations to admissible record evidence; (2) are not disputed and refuted by the other party with citations to admissible record evidence; and (3) do not make credibility determinations or state legal conclusions. See LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGA;4 see also E.E.O.C. v. Atlanta Gastroenterology Assocs., LLC, No. CIV. A. 1:05-CV-2504-TWT, 2007 WL 602212, at *3 n.2 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2007). The Court has nevertheless viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant, as required on a motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
The Court has excluded any assertions of fact by either party that are immaterial, presented as arguments or legal conclusions, are unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record, or are asserted only in a party's brief and not in the statement(s) of facts.5 See LR 56.1(B)(1), NDGa; see also LR 56.1(B)(2)(b) (non-movant's statement of additional facts must also comply with LR 56.1(B)(1)). But the Court includes certain facts that are not necessarily material if they are helpful to present the context of the parties' arguments. The Court will not rule on each objection or dispute presented by the parties, and will discuss those objections and disputes only when necessary to do so regarding a genuine dispute of a material issue of fact.

A. Organizational Structure of the Archdiocese and RCAA
 [*12] The Secretariat is the governing body of the Archdiocese and includes, among others, the Archbishop, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Operating Officer (COO), the Director of Human Resources, and the Bishops. (PAMF ¶12; DRPF ¶12.) Gregory Hartmayer became Archbishop of the Atlanta Archdiocese on May 6, 2020. (PAMF ¶9; DRPF ¶9.) Joel Konzen became Auxiliary Bishop of Atlanta in 2018. (Doc. 131-1 at 24-27.) David Spotanski held the position of COO from 2014 until March 31, 2022. (PAMF ¶7; DRPF ¶7.) Brad Wilson is an employee of RCAA, the President of RCAA, and the CFO of the Archdiocese. (PAMF ¶¶8, 114; DRPF ¶¶8, 114.) Chuck Thibaudeau is the Director of Human Resources, and Lillian Gallagher, the Benefits Manager, reports to Thibaudeau. (PAMF ¶¶3, 6; DRPF ¶¶3, 6.) Dennis Dorner is the Chancellor of the Archdiocese, and Kathleen Owens is his executive assistant. (PAMF ¶¶4, 10; DRPF ¶¶4, 10.)
The Chancery is the Archdiocese's corporate headquarters, and is the office in which Plaintiff worked as an "Events Coordinator" or "Events Planner.6 (DSMF ¶5; PRDF ¶5; PAMF ¶¶11, 16; DRPF ¶¶11, 16.) The Chancery's budget consists of two portions: the Archdiocese's portion, which totals [*13]  approximately $28 million in revenue, and RCAA's portion, which totals approximately $18 million in revenue. (PAMF ¶117; DRPF ¶117.) The Archdiocese funds a portion of the payroll for RCAA. (PAMF ¶119; DRPF ¶119.)

B. Archdiocese's Insurance and Procedures for Claims
The Archdiocese is self-insured for its group medical health coverage that covers its employees. (PAMF ¶22; DRPF ¶22.) RCAA is the sponsor of the Archdiocese's group health plan, and it indirectly pays for medical claims for the Archdiocese's self-insured medical insurance plan. (PAMF ¶¶115-116; DRPF ¶¶115-116.) A third-party administrator—Meritain—processes the medical claims for Archdiocese employees and withdraws money from an administrative account to pay those claims. (PAMF ¶¶23-24; DRPF ¶¶23-24.) Wilson, as CFO of the Archdiocese, is responsible for ensuring that there are sufficient funds in the administrative account to cover the withdrawals that Meritain makes. (PAMF ¶28; DRPF ¶28.) On a weekly basis, Wilson reviewed the total amount deducted from the administrative account to cover medical claims. (PAMF ¶25; DRPF ¶25.) The Archdiocese's [*14]  insurance and benefits committee, of which Wilson is a member, met quarterly, and when the committee reviewed the claims the Archdiocese paid, or discussed individuals on the high claimant's list, the individuals were never identified by name or any other identifying characteristic; the individuals were assigned numbers. (DSMF ¶44; PRDF ¶44; PAMF ¶¶26, 76; DRPF ¶¶26, 76; Doc. 136-1 at 242:9-20.) Wilson received information about the high claimants from the case management notes, but without reference to individual names. (DSMF ¶44; PRDF ¶44.) Wilson would periodically reconcile the numbers he reviewed with the amount Meritain deducted from the administrative account to see if they matched up. (PAMF ¶27; DRPF ¶27.)

C. Plaintiff's Employment
In April 1997, Plaintiff was hired by the Archdiocese to work as the house manager at the Archbishop's residence, and by 2010, she had transitioned to the position of "Events Coordinator" or "Events Planner," which is a position in the Chancery office. (DSMF ¶3; PRDF ¶3; PAMF ¶¶11, 15-16; DRPF ¶¶11, 15-16.) Plaintiff worked for the Archdiocese from April 1997 until her employment was terminated in December 2020, though Wilson testified that RCAA employed [*15]  Plaintiff. (PAMF ¶¶15, 118; DRPF ¶¶15, 118.) As Events Planner, Plaintiff's duties included: (1) planning, organizing, promoting, and facilitating special events sponsored by the Archdiocese, including luncheons, dinners, receptions, and the Eucharistic Congress, which is a yearly event, usually scheduled in June, with general attendance of 25,000 to 30,000 people; (2) scheduling and maintaining communication with speakers, vendors, hotels, and participants; (3) coordinating and monitoring event timelines; (4) reviewing and analyzing evaluations; (5) assisting in preparing a variety of publications, materials, and programs for events; (6) attending meetings and representing the Archbishop's office with Archdiocesan and parish staffs; (7) coordinating participation in charitable contribution campaigns; (8) acting as the prime source for promotion of activities and special events including all pilgrimages; and (9) initiating, coordinating and/or participating in all efforts to promote the Archdiocese, its parishes, activities, services, and events. (DSMF ¶4; PRDF ¶4; PAMF ¶¶13-14, 17; DRPF ¶¶13-14, 17.) Plaintiff was "great" at her job as an Events Planner. (DSMF ¶14; PRDF ¶14; PAMF [*16]  ¶18; DRPF ¶18.) At the time of her termination, Plaintiff's total compensation was $107,000 per year. (DSMF ¶14; PRDF ¶14.) Throughout her employment, Plaintiff participated in the group health insurance coverage that the Archdiocese offered to its employees. (PAMF ¶19; DRPF ¶19.)
Plaintiff was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on her pancreas in January 2017, and she underwent two surgeries in March 2017, as a result of her cancer and subsequent complications. (DSMF ¶29; PRDF ¶29; PAMF ¶29; DRPF ¶29.) She returned to work in June 2017, but since then, she has been in ongoing treatment for cancer, which includes medical appointments, gallium dotate scans, MRIs, CAT scans, lanreotide infusions, and blood labs. (DSMF ¶32; PRDF ¶32; PAMF ¶¶2, 30-31; DRPF ¶¶2, 30-31; Doc. 145-3 ¶9.) When Plaintiff dealt with physical symptoms from her surgery, Spotanski, her supervisor at that time, questioned why she was not at work; but she never received a disciplinary write up from him. (DSMF ¶¶33-34; PRDF ¶¶33-34.) Plaintiff testified that Spotanski made comments such as "[y]ou old-timers, old people, think you own this place; that's going to change," but that Wilson, Konzen, Thibaudeau, and other management [*17]  members never made any comments to her about her age. (DSMF ¶35; PRDF ¶35.) When Plaintiff asked to report to someone other than Spotanski, her supervisor was changed to Dorner, with whom she had no problems or concerns, and Dorner remained Plaintiff's supervisor until her employment was terminated. (DSMF ¶¶36-37; PRDF ¶¶36-37; PAMF ¶ 5; DRPF ¶ 5.) Plaintiff never complained to the human resources office about Spotanski, and she never reported to human resources that she felt subjected to any kind of hostile work environment, discrimination or harassment. (DSMF ¶38; PRDF ¶38.)
In the Fall of 2019, Plaintiff signed a new employment agreement with the Archdiocese, which superseded her old employment agreement, and was similar to the agreement other Archdiocese employees had signed. (DSMF ¶39; PRDF ¶39; PAMF ¶20; DRPF ¶20.) The new employment agreement was prepared by Thibaudeau, and signed by Konzen. (PAMF ¶¶20-21; DRPF ¶¶20-21.)
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. (PAMF ¶36; DRPF ¶36.) It was not immediately clear which events at the Archdiocese would continue, which events would be modified, and which events would be cancelled. (PAMF ¶37; DRPF [*18]  ¶37.) The Archdiocese was forced to close down churches and the Chancery due to COVID-19. (DSMF ¶5; PRDF ¶5.) Most of the Archdiocese's bigger events were also cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns. (DSMF ¶5; PRDF ¶5.) The Eucharistic Congress was cancelled for both 2020 and 2021, though by the time the decision was made to cancel the 2020 Eucharistic Congress, much of the planning had already been done. (DSMF ¶16; PRDF ¶16; PAMF ¶39; DRPF ¶39.) Cancelling the 2020 Eucharistic Congress, and attempting to reschedule it, was a significant undertaking that included numerous meetings, securing a reschedule date, figuring out if deposits received would be applied to the following year, returning money to vendors, and securing documentation from vendors for attendance the following year. (PAMF ¶40; DRPF ¶40.)
With churches closed, parishes were still electronically receiving offertory from their parishioners, but offertory was down, and there was a reduction in funds available to the Archdiocese. (DSMF ¶6; PRDF ¶6.) During the COVID-19 lockdowns that occurred over the summer of 2020, Wilson would "[a]t every opportunity . . . talk to the Secretariat and others about [the Archdiocese's] financial [*19]  condition" to ensure that the Archdiocese did not "spend more than [the Archdiocese brought] in." (PAMF ¶42; DRPF ¶42.) The Archdiocese applied for and received a federal Payroll Protection Program (PPP) loan,7 to pay certain payroll expenses of Archdiocese employees, but those funds were expended by September 2020.8 (DSMF ¶7; PRDF ¶7.)
In the weeks following Hartmayer being named Archbishop of Atlanta, Plaintiff had meetings with Hartmayer to coordinate the logistics of putting on a "big event" for his installation, and she began planning a "big ceremony" for his Pallium Mass. (PAMF ¶¶45-46; DRPF ¶¶45-46.) Both events were pared down due to COVID-19 restrictions. (DSMF ¶16; PRDF ¶16; PAMF ¶¶45; DRPF ¶¶45.) The installation took place on May 6, 2020, in a private ceremony held at the Cathedral. (PAMF ¶45; DRPF ¶45.)
Also in May 2020, Plaintiff had a gallium dotate scan, and after this scan, she began lanreotide infusions to treat her cancer. (PAMF ¶¶32-33; DRPF ¶¶32-33.) Throughout the summer of 2020, Plaintiff attended multiple appointments related to beginning the infusions. (PAMF ¶34; DRPF ¶34.) Plaintiff had her first cancer-related infusion treatment in October 2020, and [*20]  she will continue infusion treatment for the rest of her life. (PAMF ¶35; DRPF ¶35.)
On September 24, 2020, at the insurance and benefits committee's quarterly meeting, which Hartmayer also attended, Wilson commented on the fact that large medical claims were up above average for 2020. (PAMF ¶¶76-77; DRPF ¶¶76-77; Doc. 136-1 at 242:9-20.) The committee also discussed the fact that the majority of claimants with claims over $100,000 had cancer-related diagnoses. (PAMF ¶78; DRPF ¶78.) By their attendance at this meeting, Hartmayer and Wilson were aware that large claims, which were primarily due to cancer-related diagnoses, were higher than average in 2020. (PAMF ¶79; DRPF ¶79.)
Hartmayer's Pallium Mass took place on October 4, 2020, and was held in Atlanta rather than in Rome, Italy. (PAMF ¶¶46, 83; DRPF ¶¶46, 83; Doc. 140-1 at 94:14-21.) In an email on October 12, 2020, Hartmayer acknowledged and thanked Plaintiff for all of her hard work planning his Pallium Mass, which included paring down the guest list from over 1,000 people to 300 people, working around COVID-19 restrictions at hotels and venues, planning a cocktail party and dinner for 50 people at Hartmayer's house, and coordinating [*21]  air travel for guests. (PAMF ¶¶83-84; DRPF ¶¶83-84.)
In late-October or early-November of 2020, Wilson and Hartmayer began discussing the possibility of a reduction in force (RIF). (PAMF ¶47; DRPF ¶47.) As part of the RIF, 108 school employees and five people from the Chancery had their employment with the Archdiocese terminated.9 (DSMF ¶9; PRDF ¶9.) Hartmayer and Wilson jointly made the decision about which Chancery employees would be included in the RIF. (DSMF ¶¶9, 15, 19; PRDF ¶¶9, 15, 19; PAMF ¶63; DRPF ¶63.) Wilson provided information to Hartmayer regarding "who was not doing anything" and "being paid for it." (PAMF ¶69; DRPF ¶69.) Wilson believed that clerical services like the duties Plaintiff performed should be acquired at the "best appropriate price," and that employers have the economic incentive to hire lower-cost individuals. (PAMF ¶¶109-110; DRPF ¶¶109-110.) Hartmayer testified that it was "obvious" that Plaintiff was "not doing anything," though he also admitted that he had no personal knowledge of what Plaintiff was doing either before or after his installation. (PAMF ¶104; DRPF ¶104.) Hartmayer further testified that terminating Plaintiff's employment "wasn't a question [*22]  of money; it was a question of are we paying people for not doing anything." (PAMF ¶105; DRPF ¶105.) The initial list of people included in the RIF named Ray Egan, Plaintiff, and Richard Tolcher, and the final list included Egan, Plaintiff, Tolcher, Pat DeJarnett, and Shannon Gerard. (PAMF ¶¶64-65; DRPF ¶¶64-65.) All of the included individuals were elderly, or had a disability or condition likely to result in higher medical costs for the Archdiocese.10 (PRDF ¶17; Doc. 166 at 9.) During the discussions about the possibility of a RIF, Wilson and Hartmayer discussed reducing Plaintiff's role to part-time, which would not have included medical benefits. (PAMF ¶62; DRPF ¶62.) The initial proposal was to switch Egan, Plaintiff, and Tolcher to part-time work. (PAMF ¶68; DRPF ¶68.) Wilson was aware that Ray Egan had cancer, was in his 80s, was "very ill," and had medical problems. (PAMF ¶67; DRPF ¶67.)
On November 17, 2020, Wilson met with Thibaudeau, Spotanski, and Dorner to let them know about the RIF. (DSMF ¶18; PRDF ¶18.) Thibaudeau, Spotanski, and Dorner had not been consulted about the RIF. (PAMF ¶¶51-52, 55-56; DRPF 51-52, 55-56.) Thibaudeau felt that he should have been consulted, [*23]  and Spotanski and Dorner were both in "disbelief" at not being consulted. (PAMF ¶¶51, 55-56; DRPF ¶¶ 51, 55-56.) Spotanski described his reaction to learning that Ray Egan was included in the RIF as "flabbergasted" because Egan's sudden termination without notice to Spotanski caused Spotanski "a bit of a scramble." (PAMF ¶¶52, 54; DRPF ¶¶52, 54.) Spotanski also expressed frustration because supervisors of the affected employees were not taken into account. (PAMF ¶57; DRPF ¶57.) Dorner was surprised to learn that Plaintiff was included in the RIF, and he felt that the RIF had not been handled in keeping with normal personnel practices. (PAMF ¶56; DRPF ¶56.) Konzen felt that the process of the RIF was "rushed or somewhat jagged," and he was under the impression that Plaintiff had ongoing work to handle that would have made her termination problematic. (PAMF ¶¶58-59; DRPF ¶¶58-59.) Konzen asked Thibaudeau about the possibility of Plaintiff working part-time but keeping medical benefits, and Thibaudeau responded that it could not be done. (PAMF ¶91; DRPF ¶91.)
Also on November 17, 2020, Hartmayer met with Plaintiff to discuss the status of upcoming events. (DSMF ¶20; PRDF ¶20.) Later that [*24]  same day, Plaintiff sent an email to Hartmayer confirming certain items discussed at their meeting, and asking that he "please keep me in your prayers as I have my second cancer treatment this Thursday."11 (DSMF ¶22; PRDF ¶22; Doc. 140-2 at 32 (Ex. 11).) Also later that same day, in the parking lot at the Chancery, Dorner informed Plaintiff that he had been instructed that morning that on Friday, he would have to "let her go," though he felt that she was still needed. (DSMF ¶21; PRDF ¶21; PAMF ¶94; DRPF ¶94.)
On November 19, 2020, Thibaudeau sent an email to Hartmayer stating that he was "uncomfortable with the process that led up to" the announcement of the RIF, and thought the RIF was "rushed . . . through." (PAMF ¶60; DRPF ¶60; Doc. 133-3 at 24 (Ex. 43).) In the same email, Thibaudeau stated that, even working part-time, Plaintiff "would still not have anything to do" given that all events had been cancelled, and also that he had recommended having her bid on event planning jobs as an independent contractor because, as he testified, he believed she would make more money doing that. (DSMF ¶24; PRDF ¶24; PAMF ¶61; DRPF ¶61; Docs. 133-1 at 71:25-72:3; 133-3 at 24 (Ex. 43).) [*25]  Also on November 19, 2020, Dorner sent Plaintiff an email with a formal notification letter attached, which stated that her "position is being eliminated due to a reduction in force, effective December 21, 2020," and that she would receive her last severance payment on April 23, 2021. (DSMF ¶23; PRDF ¶23; PAMF ¶15; DRPF ¶15; Doc. 140-2 at 28-29.) Plaintiff was 68 years old when her employment was terminated, and still battling cancer. (PAMF ¶¶2, 32-35; DRPF ¶¶2, 32-35.)
At the time Plaintiff's employment was terminated, the Archdiocese had 24 claimants on the high claimant's list, meaning that the claimant had over $100,000 in medical claims from the first three quarters of 2020. (DSMF ¶45; PRDF ¶45.) Plaintiff was not on the high claimant's list, meaning that she did not have over $100,000 in medical claims from the first three quarters of 2020.12 (DSMF ¶45; PRDF ¶45.) Wilson perceived cancer-related claims to be expensive. (PAMF ¶43; DRPF ¶43.) But Wilson never said anything to Plaintiff about the expense of her medical care or treatment. (DSMF ¶42; PRDF ¶42.)
After Plaintiff's employment termination, some of the event planning duties were assigned to Spotanski, though he [*26]  did not have the capacity to perform them, and some of the duties were assigned to other individuals. (DSMF ¶25; PRDF ¶25; PAMF ¶96; DRPF ¶96.) To date, the event planner position has not been filled. (DSMF ¶25; PRDF ¶25.) An "Engagement Marketing Specialist" position was advertised and filled in October of 2020, prior to the termination of Plaintiff's employment, and Plaintiff did not apply for it. (DSMF ¶26; PRDF ¶26.) Plaintiff was never notified about any option to bid on event planning jobs as an independent contractor. (PAMF ¶¶90, 112; DRPF ¶¶90, 112.)

D. Prior Reorganizations/RIFs
When Hartmayer was the Bishop of the Savannah Archdiocese, he oversaw a major reorganization of employees. (PAMF ¶98; DRPF ¶98.) In overseeing that reorganization, Hartmayer did not make key decisions in a vacuum. (PAMF ¶99; DRPF ¶99.) He sought input from relevant leadership, including the Secretariat, and from people who would be affected by the reorganization. (PAMF ¶99; DRPF ¶99.)
Wilson was involved in a 2008 RIF that was conducted at the Archdiocese. (PAMF ¶106; DRPF ¶106.) During the 2008 RIF at the Chancery, Wilson gathered data and worked with advisory committees to make recommendations on which [*27]  positions to eliminate. (PAMF ¶107; DRPF ¶107.) There was a process of seeking input from pastors and Chancery department heads to decide which positions to eliminate. (PAMF ¶108; DRPF ¶108.)

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Framework to prove employment discrimination
A plaintiff that alleges intentional discrimination must present sufficient facts to permit a jury to rule in his or her favor using either circumstantial, or direct evidence. See Lewis v. City of Union City, Georgia, 918 F.3d 1213, 1220 and n.6 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc). To evaluate a claim supported by circumstantial evidence, Courts apply either the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, or the convincing mosaic framework.13 See Jenkins v. Nell, 26 F.4th 1243, 1249 (11th Cir. 2022); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).

(i) McDonnell Douglas Framework—Circumstantial Evidence
Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, for a plaintiff to prevail on a claim of intentional discrimination, he or she must first establish a prima facie case. Jenkins, 26 F.4th at 1249 (11th Cir. 2022); Lewis, 918 F.3d at 1220. Once a prima facie case is established, an inference of discrimination is raised, and the burden shifts to the defendant/employer, who may rebut that inference by providing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Lewis, 918 F.3d at 1221; see also St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993); McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802-804. This intermediate burden "is merely one of production; [the defendant] [*28]  need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons." Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000); Sims v. MVM, Inc., 704 F.3d 1327, 1333 (11th Cir. 2013); see also Turnes v. AmSouth Bank, NA, 36 F.3d 1057, 1061 (11th Cir. 1994) (explaining that the employer's intermediate burden of production is "exceedingly light"). If the defendant offers a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, then the presumption of discrimination is eliminated, and the plaintiff must show that the defendant's non-discriminatory reason is a pretext for the adverse employment action. St. Mary's Honor Ctr., 509 U.S. at 508; McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 804; see also Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1024-25. Though the burden shifts, the plaintiff retains the "ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that he has been the victim of intentional discrimination." St. Mary's Honor Ctr., 509 U.S. at 508 (internal citations and alterations omitted); Sims, 704 F.3d at 1333 (through the entire burden-shifting process, the ultimate burden of persuasion remains with the plaintiff).

(ii) Convincing Mosaic—Circumstantial Evidence
Under the convincing mosaic framework, a plaintiff "can still survive summary judgment by presenting circumstantial evidence that creates a triable issue concerning the employer's discriminatory intent." Jenkins, 26 F.4th at 1250 (internal quotations omitted). In other words, "if the record, viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, presents a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow [*29]  a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the decisionmaker," then a triable issue of fact exists. Jenkins, 26 F.4th at 1250; see also Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011) ("the McDonnell Douglas framework is not, and never was intended to be, the sine qua non for a plaintiff to survive a summary judgment motion in an employment discrimination case"). A convincing mosaic is established with "evidence that demonstrates, among other things, (1) suspicious timing, ambiguous statements, or other information from which discriminatory intent may be inferred, (2) systematically better treatment of similarly situated employees, and (3) pretext." Jenkins, 26 F.4th at 1250 (internal quotations omitted). A plaintiff need not present evidence in all three of these categories, but the totality of the circumstantial evidence must present a convincing mosaic of discrimination. See Smith, 644 F.3d at 1347 (to create a mosaic, plaintiff must show that "based on the totality of the circumstances . . . the record contains sufficient circumstantial evidence from which a jury could infer" that a decisionmaker discriminated against an employee).

B. Archdiocese's Motion for Summary Judgment14

(i) ADEA Claim—Count One
Under the ADEA, employers are prohibited from firing employees who are between the ages [*30]  of 40 and 70 years old because of their age. See W. Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell, 472 U.S. 400, 403-410, 105 S. Ct. 2743, 86 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1985) (explaining that the ADEA generally prohibits mandatory retirement before age 70, but that there is an exception to that rule when age is a "bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business," e.g., the FAA regulation requiring that pilots must retire by age 60) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1)); see also 29 U.S.C. § 631(a) (providing that covered individuals must be "at least 40 years of age"). To prevail on a claim under the ADEA, the employee must establish that his or her age was the "but-for" cause of the adverse employment action. Liebman v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 808 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir. 2015). To establish a prima facie case for age discrimination, a plaintiff generally must show that: "(1) [s]he was a member of the protected group between the age of forty and seventy; (2) [s]he was subject to an adverse employment action; (3) a substantially younger person filled the position from which [s]he was discharged; and (4) [s]he was qualified to do the job from which [s]he was discharged." Liebman, 808 F.3d at 1298. But in a case involving a reduction in force (RIF), like the case here, the plaintiff must show that: "(1) [s]he was in a protected age group; (2) [s]he was adversely affected by an [*31]  employment decision; (3) [s]he was qualified for [her] current position or to assume another position at the time of discharge; and (4) the evidence could lead a factfinder reasonably to conclude that the employer intended to discriminate on the basis of age." Mitchell v. City of LaFayette, 504 F. App'x 867, 870 (11th Cir. 2013); see also Watkins v. Sverdrup Tech., Inc., 153 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir. 1998). The RIF version of the prima facie case removes the prong requiring the plaintiff to show replacement by a younger person "because, in RIFs, employers rarely seek replacements for the discharged employee." Mitchell, 504 F. App'x at 870. "In order to satisfy the last prong, the plaintiff must produce some evidence that the employer did not treat [her] neutrally with respect to [her] age, but, instead, discriminated based upon it." Mitchell, 504 F. App'x at 870.
In count one of the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that, in violation of the ADEA, Defendants discriminated against her based on her age by taking adverse actions that included making ageist comments to or about her, interfering with her medical leave and treatment, and terminating her employment. (Doc. 105 at 14-15.) The section of Defendant's motion that addresses Plaintiff's ADEA claim consists of one paragraph, in which it makes conclusory statements, asserting that: (1) the only evidence Plaintiff offers in support [*32]  of her ADEA claim is an ageist remark made by her former supervisor, and any claim based on that remark would now be time-barred, though Defendant cites no authority in support of an untimeliness argument; (2) no decision-makers made ageist comments; and (3) because Defendant entered into a new employment agreement with Plaintiff the year before the RIF, "[i]t makes no sense" that it would terminate her employment the following year because of her age. (Doc. 138 at 25.) Defendant then states that Plaintiff "fails to meet her burden to bring an ADEA claim and summary judgment should, therefore be granted." (Doc. 138 at 25.)
Defendant misunderstands the summary judgment standard. It is Defendant who has not met its burden to show that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. "The moving party bears the initial burden to show the district court, by reference to materials on file, that there are no genuine issues of material fact that should be decided at trial." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991). "An issue of fact is 'material' if it is a legal element of the claim under the applicable substantive law which might affect the outcome of the case." Allen v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (explaining that "the substantive law will identify which [*33]  facts are material")). "A factual dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Peppers v. Cobb Cnty., Georgia, 835 F.3d 1289, 1295 (11th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation omitted). In deciding whether Defendant has met this burden, the Court "must view the [Defendant's] evidence and all factual inferences arising from it in the light most favorable to the [Plaintiff]." Allen, 121 F.3d at 646.
Defendant here does not address the governing law, including the legal elements of an ADEA claim, let alone show that there are no genuine issues of material fact under the governing law. (Doc. 138 at 25.) "[I]t is never enough simply to state that the non-moving party cannot meet its burden at trial." Clark, 929 F.2d at 608; see also Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 328 (J. White, concurring) ("It is not enough to move for summary judgment without supporting the motion in any way or with a conclusory assertion that the Plaintiff has no evidence to prove his case"). And because Defendant has not met its initial burden, its motion for summary judgment must be denied. See Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1116 ("If the party moving for summary judgment fails to discharge the initial burden, then the motion must be denied and the court need not consider what, if any, showing the non-movant has made"); Clark, 929 F.2d at 609 n. 9 (asking that [*34]  district courts "adhere to the mandates of the Supreme Court and Rule 56 and begin their inquiries on a motion for summary judgment by asking whether the moving party has met its burden").
Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 138), be DENIED as to Count One.

(ii) ADA Claims—Counts Two, Three, and Four

(a) Discrimination (Count Two)
To establish a prima facie case of ADA discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she has a disability; (2) she was a "qualified individual," at the relevant time; and (3) she was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability. Cleveland, 369 F.3d at 1193. If she does so, the burden of production shifts to Defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment, and if Defendant does so, Plaintiff must then show that the non-discriminatory reason is pretext. Cleveland, 369 F.3d at 1193; see also Jenkins, 26 F.4th at 1249 (11th Cir. 2022); Lewis, 918 F.3d at 1220.
In count two of the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants discriminated against her based on her disability by taking adverse actions that included making comments about the inconvenience caused by disabled employees, interfering with her medical leave and treatment, [*35]  and terminating her employment. (Doc. 105 at 15-17.) Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case. (Doc. 138 at 12-18.) Defendant argues only that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment—namely, the RIF due to COVID-19—and that Plaintiff cannot show pretext, i.e., that the true reason for terminating her employment was her cancer and cost of medical treatment, not the COVID-19 pandemic. (Doc. 138 at 13-18.) In support of its argument, Defendant points to the following undisputed facts: (1) Plaintiff's cancer treatment began in 2017, and her employment was not terminated until three years later, during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) Defendant entered into a new employment agreement with Plaintiff in Fall 2019; (3) churches were closed, and though parishes were still electronically receiving offertory, the offertory was down, and there was a reduction in funds available to the Archdiocese; (4) by September 2020, the funds from the PPP loan Defendant received for payroll expenses was gone; (5) in addition to the employees terminated from the Chancery, over 100 other employees of the Archdiocese were also let go; (6) [*36]  Plaintiff's job was event planning, and COVID-19 necessitated the cancellation of the vast majority of events; (7) following the RIF, Plaintiff's event planner position has not been filled; (8) a third-party administrator processes the medical claims for Archdiocese employees, so the RIF decision-makers—Hartmayer and Wilson—had no access to specific information about Plaintiff's medical treatment or expenses given that, to the extent they received information about claims, the individuals were never identified by name or any other identifying characteristic; and (9) Plaintiff was not one of the 24 claimants on the high claimant's list, i.e., the list of individuals that had over $100,000 in medical claims from the first three quarters of 2020.15 (Id. at 14-17.) Defendant also includes the fact that the same criteria was used for terminating the other employees from the Chancery, asserting that, for example, the employee responsible for prison ministry was included because prisons were closed to visitors. (Id. at 15; Doc. 166 at 9-11.) Plaintiff disputes this fact, however, arguing that it is refuted by evidence in the record, which Plaintiff cites, that indicates Wilson and Hartmayer [*37]  knew that all of the included individuals were elderly, or had a disability or condition likely to result in higher medical costs for the Archdiocese. (PRDF ¶17, citing testimony of Wilson, Hartmayer and Plaintiff.) Defendant argues that if medical expenses were the determinative factor, as Plaintiff alleges, the 24 people on the high claimant's list would have been terminated.16 (Doc. 138 at 17.) Defendant also argues that Hartmayer and Wilson did not know that Plaintiff had cancer, and acknowledges that Plaintiff disputes that fact, but argues that it is not material because there is no evidence that Hartmayer and Wilson included Plaintiff in the RIF because of her medical condition. (Id. at 16, citing DSMF ¶13.) According to Defendant, the economic concerns and the "declined need for event planning" caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were the reasons that Plaintiff's employment was terminated. (Id. at 15.)
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment is pretext. (Docs. 145 at 9-14, 18-21; 166 at 13-33.) To establish pretext, and avoid summary judgment, Plaintiff "must introduce significantly probative evidence showing that the asserted [*38]  reason is merely a pretext for discrimination." Brooks v. Cnty. Comm'n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., 446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir. 2006). "A reason is not pretext for discrimination unless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason." Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp. Inc., 509 F.3d 1344, 1349 (11th Cir. 2007) (emphasis in original; internal quotation omitted); Brooks, 446 F.3d at 1163 (citing St. Mary's Honor Ctr., 509 U.S. at 515). When the burden shifts to Plaintiff to show pretext, she must "meet [the proffered] reason head on and rebut it." Brooks, 446 F.3d at 1163 (alteration in original); see also Crawford v. City of Fairburn, Ga., 482 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir. 2007) (the Plaintiff must meet the employer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason "head on and rebut it"). Plaintiff "cannot show that [Defendant's] proffered reasons for terminating [her] were pretextual simply by 'quarreling with the wisdom' of those reasons." Jones v. Gulf Coast Health Care of Delaware, LLC, 854 F.3d 1261, 1274 (11th Cir. 2017) (citing Brooks, 446 F.3d at 1163). A court may not second-guess the wisdom of a defendant's business decisions, or sit as a "super-personnel department." Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1266 (11th Cir. 2010) (explaining that the Court does not "sit as a super-personnel department," nor "second guess the wisdom of an employer's business decisions," given that the wisdom of the decisions are irrelevant so long as they are not made with a discriminatory motive) (internal quotation omitted); Rowell v. BellSouth Corp., 433 F.3d 794, 798 (11th Cir. 2005) ("It is by now axiomatic that we cannot second-guess the business decisions of an employer"); Howard v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., No. 1:14-CV-03667-LMM-AJB, 2017 WL 8186848, at *4 (N.D. Ga. July 28, 2017, report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:14-CV-03667-LMM-AJB, 2017 WL 8217516 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 8, 2017). "[Plaintiff] may, however, [*39]  establish pretext by demonstrating 'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.'" Jones, 854 F.3d at 1274.
Here, Plaintiff disputes that, despite the fact that many events were cancelled, Plaintiff's job duties were eliminated, and she had nothing to do. (Doc. 145 at 10.) Plaintiff points to Hartmayer's inconsistent testimony that it was "obvious" Plaintiff was "not doing anything," though he also admitted that he had no personal knowledge of what Plaintiff was doing either before or after his installation. (Id.; PAMF ¶104; DRPF ¶104; Doc. 166 at 22.) Plaintiff also challenges the credibility of Hartmayer's testimony that he had no personal knowledge of what Plaintiff was doing before or after his installation given that it is undisputed that Hartmayer met with Plaintiff multiple times to plan his installation, which took place on May 6, 2020, and his Pallium Mass, which took place on October 4, 2020. (Doc. 145 at 10; PAMF ¶¶45-46, 83-84; DRPF ¶¶45-46, 83-84; Doc. 166 at 22.) Plaintiff also points to the testimony of Plaintiff's supervisor—Dorner—who [*40]  testified that, at the time of the RIF, Plaintiff was still needed; and to Spotanski's testimony that he had been assigned some of Plaintiff's job duties, but he did not have the capacity to perform them. (Doc. 145 at 11-12; PAMF ¶¶94, 96; DRPF ¶94, 96; Doc. 166 at 23.)
Plaintiff next challenges the fact that the Archdiocese did not follow its own policy in conducting the RIF, which required that every employment termination be reviewed by the director of Human Resources, and the fact that Hartmayer, who had previously overseen a prior reorganization in Savannah, did not consult with any of the leadership members who would normally be consulted, nor with any of the supervisors of the affected employees. (Doc. 145 at 10-11; Doc. 166 at 26-27.) It is undisputed that Hartmayer and Wilson did not consult with Thibaudeau—the director of HR—nor with Spotanski, Dorner or Konzen. (PAMF ¶¶51-52, 54-59; DRPF 51-52, 54-59.) It is disputed, however, whether or not the Archdiocese's policy at the time of the RIF required that every employment termination be reviewed by HR. (PAMF ¶¶48-49; DRPF ¶¶48-49; Doc. 166 at 5-8, 26-27) The Archdiocese's written policy, under the heading "Involuntary Terminations," [*41]  states:
The policy of the Archdiocese of Atlanta requires that every termination be reviewed and approved by the Director of Human Resources. As required by Catholic Mutual Insurance Company for employment practices liability coverage, the Director of HR will present each termination to legal counsel for approval.
(Doc. 137-3 at 34 (Ex. 197).) And Lillian Gallagher, the Benefits Manager for the Archdiocese, testified that this was the policy, which is included in the employee handbook, and that the policy, as she understood it, was not followed. (Doc. 137-1 at 96:1-22; PAMF ¶¶48-49; DRPF ¶¶48-49.) Thibaudeau, however, testified that this policy "certainly has changed," because he does not require that "the field locations" get his approval for a reduction in force. (Doc. 133-1 at 177:24-178:24; PAMF ¶¶48-49; DRPF ¶¶48-49.) According to Thibaudeau, the "only requirement today for my approval is for cause in a non-renewal. . . for cause and non-renewals we treat as termination requiring HR's approving." (Doc. 133-1 at 178:17-179:2.)
As for Defendant's assertion that it paid for Plaintiff's cancer treatments for three years, and entered into a new employment contract with her in 2019, which [*42]  according to Defendant indicates that Plaintiff's cancer was not the reason for her termination, Plaintiff points to the fact that only Thibaudeau and Konzen were involved with entering into the new employment agreement, and that Hartmayer—one of the RIF decision-makers—was not Archbishop then. (Doc. 145 at 12; DSMF ¶39; PRDF ¶39; PAMF ¶¶20-21, 45-46; DRPF ¶¶20-21, 45-46.) Plaintiff also challenges whether or not there was a true financial need for the RIF, given that multiple departments were under budget, and Defendants have given no justification for "needing" to save $441,000. (Doc. 145 at 12; Doc. 166 at 27-28).
Lastly, Plaintiff disputes that Hartmayer and Wilson did not know that she had cancer, and that there is no evidence that Hartmayer and Wilson included Plaintiff in the RIF because of her medical condition. (Docs. 145 at 8, 13-14; Doc. 166 at 25-26.) Hartmayer testified that he did not know that Plaintiff was being treated for cancer, and Wilson testified that he knew Plaintiff had surgery in 2017, but did not know what the surgery was for, or that she had cancer. (DSMF ¶13.) Plaintiff, on the other hand, testified that Konzen, Spotanski, Hartmayer, and Wilson all had knowledge [*43]  of her medical condition, and that she had multiple conversations about it with both Hartmayer and Wilson. (PRDF ¶30; PAMF ¶¶70-75.) As for evidence that Plaintiff was included in the RIF because of her medical condition, Plaintiff cites to the evidence indicating that Wilson and Hartmayer knew that all of the individuals included from the Chancery were either elderly, or had a disability or condition likely to result in higher medical costs for the Archdiocese.17 (PRDF ¶17; Doc. 166 at 9, 25-26.) Plaintiff also cites to suspicious timing—she had her first cancer-related infusion treatment in October 2020, and Wilson and Hartmayer began discussing the RIF in late-October or early-November of 2020, (PRDF ¶13; PAMF ¶¶35, 47; DRPF ¶¶35, 47; Docs. 145 at 19; 166 at 23-25.) Further, Plaintiff points to the facts that: (1) Wilson made comments to another employee, Kathleen Owens, in 2018 about her "costing us a lot of money" when she was out on medical leave, (DSMF ¶43; PRDF ¶¶13, 43); (2) Wilson perceived cancer-related claims to be expensive, (PRDF ¶13; PAMF ¶43; DRPF ¶43; Doc. 166 at 29); (3) Wilson believes that clerical services like the duties Plaintiff performed should be acquired at [*44]  the "best appropriate price," and that employers have the economic incentive to hire lower-cost individuals, (PAMF ¶¶109-110; DRPF ¶¶109-110; Doc. 166 at 29); (4) Wilson, who was responsible for ensuring that there were sufficient funds in the administrative account to cover Meritain's withdrawals, reviewed the total amount deducted from the administrative account on a weekly basis, (PRDF ¶13; PAMF ¶¶25, 28; DRPF ¶¶25, 28; Doc. 166 at 29); and (5) during COVID-19, Wilson would "[a]t every opportunity . . . talk to the Secretariat and others about [the Archdiocese's] financial condition" to ensure that the Archdiocese did not "spend more than [the Archdiocese brought] in," (PRDF ¶13; PAMF ¶42; DRPF ¶42; Doc. 166 at 29).
Considering all of the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff has sufficiently established pretext. As discussed, a Plaintiff may "establish pretext by demonstrating 'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.'" [*45]  Jones, 854 F.3d at 1274. Here, Plaintiff has done just that, particularly as to the several instances of inconsistent and conflicting testimony on material facts, including whether or not Plaintiff's job duties had in fact been eliminated due to the pandemic; whether or not the decision-makers—Wilson and Hartmayer—knew that Plaintiff had cancer prior to the RIF decision; whether or not Wilson and Hartmayer knew that the Chancery individuals were all elderly with a high cost disability or condition, and included that fact in their decision about who to terminate; and whether or not Defendant failed to follow its own policy.18 See King v. Sec'y, US Dep't of the Army, 652 F. App'x 845, 848 (11th Cir. 2016) (failure to follow established policies can be evidence of pretext); Chambers v. Fla. Dep't of Transp., 620 F. App'x 872, 879 (11th Cir. 2015) (an employer's failure to follow its own policies may be evidence of pretext).
It is not the Court's role on summary judgment to weigh conflicting evidence or make credibility determinations, and the Court must avoid doing so. Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., 93 F.3d 739, 742 (11th Cir. 1996); Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Pub. Co., 9 F.3d 913, 919 (11th Cir. 1993) (the court's function, when deciding a motion for summary judgment, is not to decide issues of material fact; it is to determine whether such issues exist to be tried). "Instead, the evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [*46]  [her] favor." Hairston, 9 F. 3d at 919 (internal quotations and alteration omitted); see also Mize, 93 F.3d at 742 ("the non-movant's evidence is to be accepted for purposes of summary judgment"). When a Plaintiff alleging discrimination "presents factual and credibility disputes which require a jury to resolve and 'would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination,' summary judgment is improper." Jenkins, 26 F.4th at 1251. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 138), be DENIED as to Count Two.

(b) Failure to Accommodate (Count Three)
The elements to establish a prima facie case for a failure to accommodate claim are the same as for a discrimination claim, as discussed above—Plaintiff must show that: (1) she has a disability; (2) she was a "qualified individual," at the relevant time; and (3) she was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability. Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007); Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). But for the third prong, "an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and unless the employer can show undue hardship." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262 (emphasis in original); Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255. An accommodation—a modification or adjustment to the work environment—is [*47]  "reasonable" and necessary under the ADA, only if it enables the employee to perform the position's essential functions. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii)). If the individual cannot perform an essential function of the job, even with an accommodation, then by definition, she is not a "qualified individual," and is not covered under the ADA. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256. But the duty of an employer to provide or investigate a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation is made by the Plaintiff. Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999); Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000). "The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367; see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56. Importantly, "reasonable accommodation" does not mean that an employer is required "to accommodate an employee in any manner in which that employee desires." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367. When a Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a "reasonable accommodation," the employer's delay or failure in investigating a reasonable accommodation is unimportant, and further, an employer has no duty to show undue hardship until the Plaintiff first shows that a reasonable accommodation [*48]  exists. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367.
In count three, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. (Doc. 105 at 17-19.) Defendant disputes that Plaintiff can establish the third prong of the prima facie case, arguing that Plaintiff never requested an accommodation and that Defendant never denied a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 138 at 19-20.) Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's claim is time-barred to the extent that it is based on Spotanski's comments and conduct in 2017, because Plaintiff did not file a timely EEOC charge. (Id. at 19.) Plaintiff responds that Defendant's argument that it never denied an accommodation is "irrelevant" because Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim is based on Defendant terminating her employment, not on her treatment going back to 2017, and for that same reason, her claim is not time-barred. (Docs. 145 at 21-22; 166 at 33-34.)
Plaintiff's assertion now that her claim is not based on any events from 2017, contradicts her allegations in the complaint that she "sought an accommodation under the ADAA when, among other things, she notified Defendants of her cancer diagnosis, her need for ongoing monthly treatment, and when she sought accommodation [*49]  for recovery from treatment," but that Defendants failed to accommodate her by making "ageist and threatening comments about her need for treatment," and also by terminating her employment "instead of allowing her to continue working and seeking treatment." (Doc. 105 at 18.) It also contradicts the allegations in her EEOC charge, filed on December 14, 2020, that her claim is based, in part, on the comments by Spotanski, and his insistence that Plaintiff needed to be physically present in the office. (Doc. 138-1 at 172-177 (Ex. K—EEOC charge); DSMF ¶27; PRDF ¶27.) It is undisputed that the ageist comments Spotanski made about "old-timers," and his insistence that Plaintiff be physically present in the office, occurred in 2017, when he was her supervisor. (DSMF ¶¶33-35; PRDF ¶¶33-35.) The only evidence Plaintiff cites in support of there being "many times that there was an insistence that she be in the office," are conversations she had with Spotanski around the time of her surgery, which was in 2017. (PRDF ¶31, citing Doc. 140-1 at 71:1-20; 140:5-11; 141:21-142:23.)
Because Plaintiff does not rely on any 2017 events in defense of her claim, and, indeed, disavows that her failure to accommodate [*50]  claim is based on any 2017 events, those grounds are abandoned. (Doc. 145 at 21-22; Doc. 166 at 33-34); see Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995) ("grounds alleged in the complaint but not relied upon in summary judgment are deemed abandoned"); see also Perez v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., No. 1:12-CV-3161-MHS, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183026, 2013 WL 6970898, at *11 n. 13 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 19, 2013) (finding that, although Plaintiff alleged in the complaint that defendant retaliated against him after he filed his EEOC charge, Plaintiff did not address this ground in defending his retaliation claim on summary judgment, and it, therefore, was abandoned.) But also, to the extent that Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim is based on any 2017 events, or any events prior to June 17, 2020, the claim is time-barred. Abram v. Fulton Cnty. Gov't, 598 F. App'x 672, 674-76 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that each specific instance of defendant's failure to grant Plaintiff's requested accommodation is a discrete act, requiring that Plaintiff file an EEOC charge within 180 days of the denial of the accommodation, and otherwise, the claim is time barred); see also Salser v. Clarke Cty. Sch. Dist., No. 3:10-CV-17 (CDL), 2011 WL 56064, at *4 (M.D. Ga. Jan. 5, 2011) (citations and internal marks omitted) ("Each alleged denial of a reasonable accommodation is a discrete act that must be challenged as separate statutory discrimination and retaliation claims").
To the extent that Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim is based only on the fact that Defendant [*51]  terminated her employment in December 2020, "instead of allowing her to continue working and seeking treatment," as she now asserts, her claim still fails. (Docs. 105 at 18; 145 at 22; 166 at 33-34.) First, neither Plaintiff's complaint, nor her response to Defendant's motion, identify any specific accommodation request that was made by Plaintiff, and denied by Defendant, after 2017. (Docs. 105 at 17-19; 145 at 21-22.) In her response, Plaintiff states only that Defendant's argument that she never requested an accommodation and was never denied an accommodation is "irrelevant." (Doc. 145 at 22.) The Court disagrees. It is undisputed that when Plaintiff asked to report to someone other than Spotanski, her supervisor was changed to Dorner, with whom she had no problems or concerns, and Dorner remained Plaintiff's supervisor until her employment was terminated in December 2020. (DSMF ¶¶36-38; PRDF ¶¶36-38; PAMF ¶ 5; DRPF ¶ 5.) Plaintiff does not dispute that when Dorner was her supervisor, she was allowed to work at home. (PRDF ¶31; see also Doc. 1401 at 140:12-20.) And Plaintiff also testified that she never asked anyone else, either in HR or management, for the option to telecommute [*52]  instead of coming into the office, and that she was never denied time off from work for medical procedures or treatment. (Doc. 140-1 at 135: 7-21, 140:21-25, 141:16-20.) "An employee's failure to request a reasonable accommodation is fatal to the prima facie case; the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Warren v. Volusia Cnty., Fla., 188 F. App'x 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2006); see also Connelly v. WellStar Health Sys., Inc., 758 F. App'x 825, 831 (11th Cir. 2019) (affirming grant of summary judgment on failure to accommodate claim because Plaintiff never alleged that she requested any disability-specific accommodation that triggered defendant's duty to accommodate her).
Second, Plaintiff cites to no authority supporting her argument that terminating her employment, instead of allowing her to "continue" her employment, constitutes failure to provide a "reasonable accommodation" under the ADA. (Docs. 145 at 21-22; 166 at 33-34); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii) (defining the term reasonable accommodation as "Modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position").
Plaintiff [*53]  cannot establish a prima facie case under the ADA for a failure to accommodate because she has not alleged, nor pointed the Court to any evidence showing that she made a specific demand for a reasonable accommodation after 2017, when her supervisor was changed to Dorner, that triggered Defendant's duty, and that Defendant denied. Gaston, 167 F.3d 1363; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367; Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 138), be GRANTED as to Count Three.

(c) Retaliation (Count Four)
"An employer may not retaliate against an employee for opposing any employment practice made unlawful by the ADA." Branscomb v. Sec'y of Navy, 461 F. App'x 901, 905 (11th Cir. 2012). To establish a prima facie case under the ADA for retaliation, Plaintiff must show that: "(1) [s]he engaged in a statutorily protected expression; (2) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the adverse action and [her] protected expression." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260; Satchel v. Sch. Bd. of Hillsborough Cnty., 251 F. App'x 626, 629 (11th Cir. 2007). And the same burden-shifting McDonnell Douglas framework applies. Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 49 n.3, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003); Satchel, 251 F. App'x at 629 (citing Pennington v. City of Huntsville, 261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir. 2001)).
In count four of the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she engaged in statutorily protected activity by "requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disabilities," and that Defendant retaliated against her by "terminating her [*54]  employment after she required frequent and costly medical treatment for her disability." (Doc. 105 at 19-21). Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim is a "reclothed" version of her other ADA claims, and should be dismissed on that ground. (Doc. 138 at 21.) The Court agrees.
In her response to Defendant's motion, and at oral argument, Plaintiff changed the protected activity she engaged in, for which Defendant retaliated against her, to "taking time for medical treatment and appointments and the corresponding costs," and she does not address the allegation in her complaint that Defendant's retaliation was based on her request for a reasonable accommodation. (Docs. 145 at 23; 166 at 34-36.) Because Plaintiff does not address that ground in defense of her retaliation claim, it is abandoned.19 (Doc. 145 at 22-23); see Resol. Tr. Corp., 43 F.3d at 599 ("grounds alleged in the complaint but not relied upon in summary judgment are deemed abandoned"); see also Perez, 2013 WL 6970898, at *11 n.13 (finding that, although Plaintiff alleged in the complaint that defendant retaliated against him after he filed his EEOC charge, Plaintiff did not address this ground in defending his retaliation claim on summary judgment, and it, therefore, was abandoned).
As modified, Plaintiff's claim that Defendant retaliated against her by terminating her employment because she required, and took time for, frequent and costly medical treatment, (Docs. 145 at 22-23; 166 at 34-36), is a duplicate of her ADA discrimination claim set forth in count two, and it should, therefore, be dismissed. See Supra, Section IV(B)(ii)(a); Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1261 (rejecting retaliation claim because it "merely reclothes [Plaintiff's] ADA discrimination claim"); Jernigan v. Bellsouth Telecommunications, LLC, 17 F. Supp. 3d 1317, 1320 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (holding that Plaintiff's retaliation claim is duplicative of his discrimination claim as Plaintiff presented no independent evidentiary basis upon which the retaliation claim may be anchored, and insufficient additional evidentiary grounds exist in the record to support the retaliation claim's survival past summary judgment); Perez, 2013 WL 6970898, at *11 (dismissing ADA retaliation claim because all the acts that Plaintiff describes in support of his retaliation claim relate to his discrimination claim, and the retaliation claim "is a duplicate of his discrimination claim"); see also see also Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1288 (11th Cir.1997) (refusing to address Plaintiff's "retaliation" claims that were based on simple refusals to accommodate because the "the acts [Plaintiff] describes relate directly to [*56]  her 'reasonable accommodation' discrimination claim, not her retaliation claim"); Calvo v. Walgreens Corp., 340 F. App'x 618, 626 (11th Cir. 2009) (rejecting Plaintiff's retaliation claim because the "gist" of her claim was that defendant refused to accommodate her, which "misunderstands the statute").
Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 138), be GRANTED as to Count Four.

(iii) FMLA Claims—Counts Five and Six

(a) Statute of Limitations
In count five of the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants interfered with her exercise of her FMLA rights by pressuring her to return to work after her March 2017 surgery; by making ageist and threatening comments; by terminating her employment rather than allowing her to continue her monthly cancer treatments that began on October 23, 2020; and by considering her desire to take protected FMLA leave as a "motivating factor" in deciding to terminate her employment. (Doc. 105 at 21-23.) In count six, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants retaliated against her for exercising her FMLA rights by making ageist and threatening comments following her March 2017 surgery; by terminating her employment when she was entitled to take leave under the FMLA to continue her monthly [*57]  cancer treatments that began on October 23, 2020; and by considering her desire to take protected FMLA leave as a "motivating factor" in deciding to terminate her employment. (Id. at 23-25.)
Defendant argues that both of Plaintiff's FMLA claims (counts five and six) are time-barred because they are based on Plaintiff's surgery in March 2017, and events surrounding Plaintiff's surgery, but Plaintiff filed this action four years later, outside the two-year statute of limitations for an FMLA claim. (Doc. 183 at 23.) Again contradicting some of the allegations in her complaint, Plaintiff now states, both in her response and at oral argument, that Plaintiff's FMLA claims are not based on any 2017 events—i.e., pressuring her to return to work after her March 2017 surgery, and making ageist and threatening comments. (Docs. 145 at 23-24; 166 at 36.) Thus, those grounds are abandoned. Resol. Tr. Corp., 43 F.3d at 599 ("grounds alleged in the complaint but not relied upon in summary judgment are deemed abandoned"); Perez v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183026, 2013 WL 6970898, at *11 n. 13 (finding that, although Plaintiff alleged in the complaint that defendant retaliated against him after he filed his EEOC charge, Plaintiff did not address this ground in defending his retaliation claim on summary [*58]  judgment, and it, therefore, was abandoned). Instead, Plaintiff asserts that her FMLA claims are based on Plaintiff's ongoing need for FMLA leave for her cancer treatments, which began on October 23, 2020, and Defendants terminating her employment, which Plaintiff alleges was motivated by her future need to take protected FMLA leave. (Docs. 145 at 23-24; 166 at 36-37; see also Doc. 105 at 21-25.)
Plaintiff's claims are not time-barred. An FMLA claim is not ripe until a materially adverse action, such as loss of pay or termination, occurs. Jacobs v. Lockheed Martin Corp., No. 1:14-CV-03575-CAP-AJB, 2016 WL 11544772, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 23, 2016); see also Jackson v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., No. 1:20-CV-00859-MLB-JEM, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 222604, 2022 WL 17488712, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 24, 2022), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:20-CV-859-MLB, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39308, 2023 WL 2429481 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 9, 2023)(explaining that "an FMLA claim begins to accrue when a materially adverse action, such as termination, occurs"). The statute of limitations for bringing a claim under the FMLA is generally two years "after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought." 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1); Henry v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., No. 1:18-CV-005907-MLB-LTW, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145133, 2020 WL 4550936, at *7 (N.D. Ga. May 20, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:18-CV-05907, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 208571, 2020 WL 6482986 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 1, 2020). Here, the "last event" that constituted an "adverse action" was Plaintiff's termination on December 21, 2020, and this action was filed on March 9, 2021, (Doc. 1), which was within two years.

(b) Interference (Count Five)
The FMLA applies to private-sector employers [*59]  with 50 or more employees, and it grants eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for the employee's own serious health condition that renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the position, or for the employee to care for a close family member with a serious health condition. Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1204 (11th Cir. 2001); Kaylor v. Fannin Reg'l Hosp., Inc., 946 F. Supp. 988, 995 (N.D. Ga. 1996); 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a). To be "eligible," the employee must have been employed for at least 12 months, and also worked at least 1,250 hours during the prior 12-month period. Kaylor, 946 F. Supp. at 996; 29 U.S.C. § 2611(2). The FMLA also provides for "intermittent" leave, which means that leave may be taken "in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason," and allows leave for an employee to attend appointments with a healthcare provider for necessary treatment of a serious health condition. Diamond v. Hospice of Fla. Keys, Inc., 677 F. App'x 586, 592 (11th Cir. 2017); Kaylor, 946 F. Supp. at 996; 29 U.S.C. § 2612(b); 29 C.F.R. § 825.202(a) ("Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason").
Plaintiff testified, and also conceded at oral argument, that during the time that Plaintiff was employed by Defendants, she was never denied leave—presumably paid sick leave, though the record is silent as to that fact—to have surgery, recover, and attend all of her subsequent medical appointments and treatments. [*60]  (Docs. 140-1 at 135:7-21, 140:12-20, 141:16-20; 166 at 37-38.) Plaintiff's FMLA claims, as discussed above, are based on Plaintiff's need for future intermittent FMLA leave for her cancer treatments, which began on October 23, 2020, and Defendants terminating her employment, which Plaintiff alleges was motivated by her need to take future protected FMLA leave. (Docs. 105 at 21-25; 145 at 23-24; 166 at 36-38); see also Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir. 2010) (an FMLA interference claim may be based on "the right to commence FMLA leave," though the right to non-interference with the commencement of leave is not absolute).
An FMLA interference claim has two elements: (1) the employee was entitled to a benefit under the FMLA, and (2) her employer denied her that benefit. White v. Beltram Edge Tool Supply, Inc., 789 F.3d 1188, 1191 (11th Cir. 2015). The first element subsumes several sub-elements, including that: (1) the defendant is a covered entity; (2) the Plaintiff is eligible for FMLA benefits; (3) the Plaintiff sought leave for a qualifying reason; and (4) the Plaintiff provided notice meeting certain criteria. See Moore v. GPS Hosp. Partners IV, LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 1293, 1297 (S.D. Ala. 2019) (citing Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Civil) 4.16 (2013)). But a technical violation alone is not enough. Ramji v. Hosp. Housekeeping Sys., LLC, 992 F.3d 1233, 1241 (11th Cir. 2021). To prevail on an FMLA interference claim, Plaintiff must "demonstrate some harm from the alleged interference, and [*61]  that harm must be remediable by either damages or equitable relief." Ramji, 992 F.3d at 1241 (internal quotations omitted); Munoz v. Selig Enterprises, Inc., 981 F.3d 1265, 1274-75 (11th Cir. 2020); Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1284 (11th Cir. 1999) ("Even if the defendants have committed certain technical infractions under the FMLA, Plaintiff may not recover in the absence of damages"). Damages include wages, salary, employment benefits, or other compensation that the employee did not receive due to the FMLA violation, and equitable relief includes employment, reinstatement, and promotion. Ramji, 992 at 1245. When bringing an interference claim, unlike a retaliation claim, the employer's motives are irrelevant. Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207-08; White, 789 F.3d at 1191 n.2 (an employer may be liable for FMLA interference despite good intentions as its "motives are irrelevant").
In sum, to prevail on an FMLA interference claim, Plaintiff must show that:
(1) Plaintiff was entitled to a benefit, which means that:
• Defendant was a covered entity;
• Plaintiff was eligible for FMLA benefits;
• Plaintiff sought leave for a qualifying reason; and
• Plaintiff provided proper notice; and
(2) Defendant denied the benefit.
If Plaintiff shows these elements, she must then show that she suffered harm, and that the harm is remediable by damages or equitable relief. An employer is not liable for interfering with FMLA leave, [*62]  however, if the employer shows that the employee who was dismissed would have been dismissed regardless of any request for leave, meaning that the dismissal was "wholly unrelated" to the FMLA leave. Davis v. Yellowpages.com LLC, No. 1:17-CV-397-ELR-JKL, 2019 WL 13292976, at *16 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 25, 2019), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:17-CV-00397-ELR, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 250452, 2019 WL 13292974 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 28, 2019) (recommending that summary judgment be granted on claim that defendant interfered with Plaintiff's future intermittent FMLA leave by terminating her employment, in part because defendant showed that Plaintiff's dismissal was "wholly unrelated" to her FMLA leave; defendant had to reduce her team by one employee, and Plaintiff was chosen in the Rate and Rank process); see also Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1236 (holding that an employee can be dismissed, preventing her from exercising her right to commence FMLA leave, without violating the FMLA, if the employee would have been dismissed regardless of any request for FMLA leave). Although a causal nexus is not an element of an interference claim, the employer can raise this lack of causation as an affirmative defense to liability. Spakes v. Broward Cnty. Sheriff's Off., 631 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir. 2011). Thus, the Court must also determine whether the FMLA leave (or future FMLA leave) was the proximate cause of the employee's discharge. Davis, 2019 WL 13292976, at *16 (citing Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236, 1242 (11th Cir. 2010)).
Here, Defendant does not dispute the first three prongs under [*63]  element one, but it disputes the fourth prong, arguing that Plaintiff did not provide adequate notice that she was seeking future FMLA leave, as Plaintiff admitted "she never asked to take FMLA leave." (Doc. 138 at 23-24.) Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's future FMLA leave was not the proximate cause of her employment termination, asserting that her employment was terminated as a result of the RIF due to COVID-19. (Id.) Plaintiff responds that she was not required to specifically request FMLA leave, and that Defendant's alleged reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment "has been addressed." (Docs. 145 at 23-24; 166 at 37-38.)

(1) Notice
Though having a qualifying reason for FMLA leave is necessary, the qualifying reason alone is not sufficient for an employee to earn FMLA leave. White, 789 F.3d at 1195. The employee "must also give her employer notice of her need for leave, and she can state an interference claim only if she gave proper notice." Id. (internal citations omitted). Under the federal regulations, what a notice must say and when notice must be given depends on whether the need for leave is foreseeable or unforeseeable. Id.
First, for timing, if the need for leave is foreseeable, the employee [*64]  must give at least 30 days advance notice, unless giving 30 days' notice is impracticable, in which case the employee must give only "such notice as is practicable." White, 789 F.3d at 1195 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2612(e)(2) and 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(a)). But if the need for leave is unforeseeable, the 30-day requirement does not apply, and instead, the employee must provide notice to the employer "as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case." Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(a)).
Second, for content, an employee is not required to explicitly mention the FMLA when giving notice, "[b]ut the FMLA and its regulations do require that the notice convey certain information." White, 789 F.3d at 1196. If the need for leave is foreseeable, an employee must give notice that is "sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave," and must provide the "anticipated timing and duration of the leave." White, 789 F.3d at 1196 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(c) (alteration in original)). But if the need for leave is unforeseeable, "an employee need only 'provide sufficient information for [her] employer to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request.'" Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(b) (alteration in original)).
The federal regulations for both foreseeable and unforeseeable leave also allow an [*65]  employer to establish notice and procedure requirements, absent unusual circumstances. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(c) ("When the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances."); 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(d) (when leave is foreseeable, "[a]n employer may require an employee to comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances.").
Neither the FMLA, nor its implementing regulations defines the terms "foreseeable" and "unforeseeable," but generally, "an employee's need for leave is foreseeable if it is based on planned medical treatment." White, 789 F.3d at 1196. Here, it is undisputed that beginning in May 2020, and throughout the summer of 2020, Plaintiff attended multiple appointments related to beginning lanreotide infusions to treat her cancer; she had the first infusion treatment in October 2020; and she will continue the infusion treatment for the rest of her life. (PAMF ¶¶32-35; DRPF ¶¶32-35.) Because the infusions were "planned medical treatment," her need for FMLA leave for these infusions was foreseeable. White, 789 F.3d at 1196. Thus, Plaintiff was required [*66]  to: (1) give notice 30 days in advance, or as much notice as practicable; (2) provide information "sufficient to make [Defendant] aware that [she] needs FMLA-qualifying leave," and provide the "anticipated timing and duration of the leave"; and (3) absent a showing of unusual circumstances, "comply with [Defendant's] usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave." White, 789 F.3d at 1195-96; 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(d).
Whether or not Plaintiff provided adequate notice of her need for future intermittent FMLA leave is disputed. There are no written requests for leave in the record before the Court that establish notice. As previously discussed, Plaintiff testified that she had multiple conversations about her medical condition with both Hartmayer and Wilson, and Plaintiff argues that those conversations put Defendants "on notice" of her need for future intermittent FMLA-qualifying leave. (PRDF ¶30; PAMF ¶¶70-75; Doc. 166 at 36-38.) Hartmayer, on the other hand, testified that he did not know that Plaintiff was being treated for cancer, and Wilson testified that he knew Plaintiff had surgery in 2017, but did not know what the surgery was for, or that she had cancer. (DSMF ¶13.) Plaintiff sent an email to Hartmayer [*67]  on November 17, 2020—the same day that Dorner informed Plaintiff he had been instructed to "let her go"—in which Plaintiff asked that Hartmayer "please keep me in your prayers as I have my second cancer treatment this Thursday," but Defendant argues that the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment was made before the email was sent. (DSMF ¶¶21-22; PRDF ¶¶21-22; PAMF ¶94; DRPF ¶94; Docs. 140-2 at 32 (Ex. 11); 166 at 42-43.)
Viewing the evidence before the Court in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required, and given the conflicting testimony regarding whether Plaintiff provided sufficient notice, summary judgment is not appropriate. See Mize, 98 F.3d at 742 ("It is not the court's role to weigh conflicting evidence or to make credibility determinations"); see also Fuller v. AT&T, No. 12-1001, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1832, 2014 WL 66019, *6 (W.D. Penn. Jan. 8, 2014)("In a dispute over an employee's adequacy of notice, the issue is generally a question of fact") (citing Lichtenstein v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 691 F.3d 294, 304 (3d Cir. 2021)); Ruark v. Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc., No. 4:13-cv-00283-KGB, 2014 WL 1809606, *5 (E.D. Ark. May 2, 2014) ("the adequacy of an employee's notice requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances and is typically a jury question") (citing Murphy v. FedEx Nat'l LTL, Inc., 618 F.3d 893, 903 (8th Cir. 2010)).

(2) Causation
Summary judgment is also inappropriate given that Defendant has not established that Plaintiff's termination was "wholly unrelated" to the FMLA leave. Davis, 2019 WL 13292976, at *16. As discussed [*68]  above, a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff sufficiently established that Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment—the RIF due to COVID-19—is pretext. See Supra, Section IV(B)(ii)(a).
Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 138), be DENIED as to Count Five.

(c) Retaliation (Count Six)
Similar to an ADA retaliation claim, to establish a prima facie case under the FMLA for retaliation, Plaintiff must show that: "(1) [s]he engaged in a statutorily protected activity;20 (2) [s]he suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) the decision was causally related to the protected activity." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367. And similarly, the burden-shifting McDonnell Douglas framework applies. That is, once a Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the inference of discrimination by providing a legitimate, non-discriminatory/non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action, and if the defendant does so, the Plaintiff must show that the defendant's nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext. Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207 (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)).
Similar to Plaintiff's ADA claim, Defendant does not dispute that [*69]  Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case, and argues only that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment—namely, the RIF due to COVID-19—and that Plaintiff cannot show pretext, i.e., that the true reason for terminating her employment was her cancer and cost of medical treatment, not the COVID-19 pandemic. (Doc. 138 at 24-25, citing its ADA argument.) Plaintiff responds that she also relies on her ADA argument, which presumably refers to Plaintiff's assertion that Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment is pretext. (Doc. 145 at 23-24.) The Court, therefore, finds that, for the same reasons discussed previously, a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff has sufficiently established pretext. See Supra, Section IV(B)(ii)(a).
Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 138), be DENIED as to Count Six.

C. RCAA's Motion for Summary Judgment
RCAA states that it adopts and incorporates all of the arguments raised in the Archdiocese's motion for summary judgment, and asserts that for all of the same reasons, summary judgment should be granted in favor of [*70]  RCAA. (Doc. 139 at 2.) But RCAA also raises an alternative argument, asserting that all of Plaintiff's claims arise from actions taken by the Archdiocese, which is a separate legal entity, and that Plaintiff failed to allege any wrongdoing on the part of RCAA. (Id.) In other words, according to RCAA, even as a joint employer, it is not liable for the separate actions of the Archdiocese, it is liable only for its own actions, and the discriminatory acts and adverse employment action—i.e., termination of Plaintiff's employment—that underly Plaintiff's claims were committed by the Archdiocese without any participation by RCAA "in any of the decisions." (Id. at 3-8; Doc. 166 at 18-20.) In support of its argument, RCAA cites to several paragraphs of Plaintiff's complaint, and then states that Plaintiff "offers no facts that would support a claim that RCAA participated in any of the decisions or actions that give rise to her claims." (Doc. 139 at 7.) Thus, RCAA argues that even if summary judgment is not granted for the Archdiocese, it should be granted in favor of RCAA. (Id.)
RCAA has not met its burden to show that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on its alternative liability [*71]  argument. "The moving party bears the initial burden to show the district court, by reference to materials on file, that there are no genuine issues of material fact that should be decided at trial." Clark, 929 F.2d at 608; see also LR 56.1(B)(1)(b), NDGa ("The Court will not consider any fact . . . supported by a citation to a pleading rather than to evidence"). "[I]t is never enough simply to state that the non-moving party cannot meet its burden at trial." Clark, 929 F.2d at 608; Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 328 (J. White, concurring) ("It is not enough to move for summary judgment without supporting the motion in any way or with a conclusory assertion that the Plaintiff has no evidence to prove his case"). In deciding whether Defendant has met this burden, the Court "must view the [Defendant's] evidence and all factual inferences arising from it in the light most favorable to the [Plaintiff]." Allen, 121 F.3d at 646.
RCAA here does not show that there are no genuine issues of material fact under the governing law. (Doc. 139.) Indeed, contrary to its conclusory statement that RCAA had no participation in the discriminatory acts and adverse employment action underlying Plaintiff's claims, the undisputed facts include that: (1) Brad Wilson is an employee of RCAA, the President of RCAA, and the CFO of [*72]  the Archdiocese, (PAMF ¶¶8, 114; DRPF ¶¶8, 114); (2) according to Wilson, Plaintiff is an employee of RCAA, (PAMF ¶118; DRPF ¶118); and (3) Wilson and Hartmayer were the two decision-makers, who jointly made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment, (PAMF ¶¶47, 63, 69; DRPF ¶¶47, 63, 69; DSMF ¶¶9, 15, 19; PRDF ¶¶9, 15, 19.) Those facts alone refute RCAA's assertion that it had no participation "in any of the decisions," and instead indicates that RCAA, through Wilson, had significant participation in the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment. (Doc. 139 at 7); see also Llampallas v. Mini-Cirs., Lab, Inc., 163 F.3d 1236, 1244-45 (11th Cir. 1998) (explaining that, under a "single employer" theory, or a "joint employer" theory, an employer's liability depends on "the degree of control an entity has over the adverse employment decision"). In any event, because RCAA has not met its initial burden, its motion for summary judgment, based on its alternative liability argument, must be denied. See Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1116 ("If the party moving for summary judgment fails to discharge the initial burden, then the motion must be denied and the court need not consider what, if any, showing the non-movant has made"); Clark, 929 F.2d at 609 n. 9 (asking that district courts "adhere to the mandates of the Supreme [*73]  Court and Rule 56 and begin their inquiries on a motion for summary judgment by asking whether the moving party has met its burden").
To the extent that RCAA adopted the Archdiocese's motion and arguments, the same rulings discussed above apply. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that RCAA's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 139), be DENIED IN PART as to its alternative liability argument, and as to Counts One, Two, Five and Six; and GRANTED IN PART as to Counts Three and Four.

V. CONCLUSION
For the above reasons, the Court RECOMMENDS that the Archdiocese's motion, (Doc. 138), be DENIED IN PART as to Counts One, Two, Five and Six, and GRANTED IN PART as to Counts Three and Four. The Court further RECOMMENDS that RCAA's motion, (Doc. 139), be DENIED IN PART as to its alternative liability argument, and as to Counts One, Two, Five and Six; and GRANTED IN PART as to Counts Three and Four.
As all matters referred to the undersigned have been ruled upon, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned Magistrate Judge.
SO RECOMMENDED and DIRECTED this 5th day of June, 2023.
