Opinion



MEMORANDUM & ORDER
MARGO K. BRODIE, United States District Judge:
Plaintiff Cameron Gardin commenced the above-captioned action against Defendant Delta Air Lines, Inc. on April 13, 2018, alleging interference and retaliation under the Family Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. ("FMLA"), and discrimination and intentional infliction of emotional distress in violation of the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law § 290 et seq. (the "NYSHRL"), and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-101 et seq. (the "NYCHRL"). (Compl., Docket Entry No. 1.) On October 7, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint ("TAC"),1 asserting claims for interference with FMLA rights; retaliation for exercising FMLA rights; failure to accommodate, constructive discharge, and retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. ("ADA"); and discrimination in violation of the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL. (TAC, Docket Entry No. [*2]  45.)2 Plaintiff alleges that Defendant disciplined him for exercising his rights under the FMLA and violated the ADA, the NYSHRL, and the NYCHRL by discriminating against him on the basis of his disability — HIV-associated myelopathy — a nervous disorder that causes involuntary muscle spasms. (TAC ¶ 29.)
Defendant moves for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Plaintiff opposes the motion.3 Plaintiff also moves for leave to file a sur-reply in further opposition to Defendant's motion, arguing that Defendant's reply brief "mischaracterizes a number of [his] arguments."4 (Pl.'s Mot. to file Sur-reply, Docket Entry No. 65; Sur-reply, annexed to Pl.'s Mot. to file Sur-reply as Ex. A, Docket Entry No. 65-1.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Court grants Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's claims of (1) interference under the FMLA, (2) failure to accommodate and constructive discharge under the ADA, (3) discrimination in violation of the NYSHRL, and (4) constructive discharge in violation of the NYCHRL and dismisses these claims with prejudice. The Court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment as [*3]  to Plaintiff's claims of (1) retaliation under the FMLA, the ADA, the NYSHRL, and the NYCHRL, and (2) failure to accommodate under the NYCHRL.

I. Background
The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. Defendant is a global airline and transportation company with locations and services throughout the world. (Def.'s Stmt, of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 ("Def.'s 56.1") ¶ 1, Docket Entry No. 57.) In March of 2008, Plaintiff began working for Defendant as a flight attendant. (Id. ¶ 20.) At some point between May and July of 2008, Plaintiff was diagnosed with HIV. (Pl.'s Dep. 23:3-12, annexed to Decl. of David A. Berlin ("Berlin Decl.") as Ex. A, Docket Entry No. 64-1.) Several years later, in 2012, Plaintiff was diagnosed with HIV-related myelopathy, a nervous disorder that causes involuntary muscle spasms. (Pl.'s Dep. 31:3-15, 32:15-17, 35:24-36:3.)

a. Defendant's relevant policies and procedures
Defendant's policies for flight attendants are set forth in several documents, including The Way We Fly, which is a written outline of Defendant's expectations for its employees, that establishes its standard of reliability. (Def.'s 56.1 ¶¶ 3-4 (first citing The Way We Fly, annexed [*4]  to the Decl. of Michael Friel Fleming ("Fleming Decl.") as Ex. F, Docket Entry No. 58-6; and then citing Pl.'s Dep. 81:14-82:2).) The Way We Fly advises employees that in order to meet its "customer commitments, [flight attendants'] regular and timely attendance is essential." (The Way We Fly 16.) In furtherance of this standard, the document advises employees to "talk with [their] leader" — Field Service Managers ("FSMs") — "for more information" regarding Delta's absence policies. (Id.; Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 4.) Defendant also "maintain[s] an Absence Notification Policy that requires [flight attendants using FMLA] to notify the Management Support Team ('MST') and [In Flight Scheduling] if they are unable to cover a flight assignment at least three hours before the report time for an assignment." (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 5 (first citing Delta's Absence Notification Policy (the "Absence Policy") 4, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. G, Docket Entry No. 58-7; and then citing The Way We Fly 16).) In the event a flight attendant fails to notify In Flight Scheduling more than three hours in advance of their report time, the flight attendant's schedule will be "marked with the code 'CFSM' (which stands for [*5]  'Failure to Cover, See Manager')." (Id. ¶ 6.) A flight attendant who receives a CFSM code must meet with their FSM to discuss the absence before they are permitted to fly again. (Id) After the meeting, the FSM will determine whether the code should be changed to "FCOK," which stands for "Failure to Cover, Okay to Fly," or "MTO," which stands for "Managed Time Out." (Id.)
During the relevant time period, Defendant maintained a Leave of Absence Policy ("Leave Policy"), providing the terms under which eligible employees may take time off from work, including for medical reasons as provided for under the FMLA. (Id. ¶¶ 18, 33 (citing Leave Policy, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. K, Docket Entry No. 58-11).) Defendant's Leave Policy provides, in relevant part, that "[f]light attendants using FMLA must follow [In Flight Scheduling] call-in procedure which is contacting the MST desk at least [three] hours prior to sign-in of a trip," and notifying Sedgwick Claims Management ("Sedgwick"), Defendant's third-party administrator of FMLA, "on the same day as the first absence, if initiating a new FMLA claim." (Leave Policy 4; see also Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 33.) Thus, where an employee is approved for intermittent [*6]  FMLA leave, Defendant's policy requires that the employee advise Sedgwick "of each absence that the employee takes pursuant to the condition for which they have FMLA [l]eave." (Decl. of Thomas Kluxdal ("Kluxdal Decl") ¶ 20, Docket Entry No. 59.) Defendant maintains this policy to "ensure[] that the employee's leave usage is consistent with the frequency and duration for which they received approval." (Id.) In the event Defendant notifies Sedgwick that an employee violated one of Defendant's policies in connection with an absence, Sedgwick will contact the employee for additional information and then "make a determination as to whether the absence will be covered under the employee's approved FMLA leave." (Id. ¶ 22.) Even in cases where the employee violated Defendant's absence policy, if the absence is subsequently approved for FMLA leave, Defendant will remove from an employee's file any "cases where performance development [was] issued based on absences that are subsequently approved for FMLA leave." (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 40.)
Employee performance issues are handled through Defendant's four-level manager intervention procedure. (Id. ¶ 8 (citing Def.'s Performance Policy, annexed to Fleming [*7]  Decl. as Ex. H, Docket Entry No. 58-8).) "The first level of performance development is verbal coaching, during which an employee and manager will meet and discuss an observed performance issue." (Id. ¶ 9.) Verbal coaching does not impact an employee's pay or benefits. (Id.) The second "level of performance development is written coaching, which is documentation of a counseling session that is administered if an employee's performance does not improve after verbal coaching." (Id. ¶ 10.) The written performance review is maintained in the employee's file for eighteen months but does not impact the employee's pay or benefits. (Id.) "The third level of performance development is a Corrective Action Notice[,]... which is issued if an employee's performance does not improve after verbal and written coaching." (Id. ¶ 11.) The Corrective Action Notice remains in the employee's file for twenty-four months. (Id.) The Corrective Action Notice does not directly impact an employee's wages or benefits, but it renders the employee ineligible for promotion so long as the notice remains on file. (Id.; Pl.'s Counter Stmt, of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 ("Pl.'s Counter 56.1") ¶ 11, Docket Entry No. [*8]  63.)
The final level of performance development is a Final Corrective Action Notice, which is issued if an employee fails to improve their performance after receiving a Corrective Action Notice. (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 12.) Employees are notified that a Final Corrective Action Notice "may result in review for termination for any infraction or failure to demonstrate adequate improvement" during the thirty-six-month period for which the notice remains in the employee's file. (Id.) Like the Corrective Action Notice, the Final Corrective Action Notice does not directly impact an employee's wages or benefits but renders the employee ineligible for promotion so long as the notice remains on file. (Id. ¶ 12; Pl.'s Counter 56.1 ¶ 12.)

b. Plaintiff's employment history with Delta

i. March 2008 to December 2012 — Commencement of employment and long-term disability leave
Defendant hired Plaintiff in March of 2008 as a flight attendant. (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 20.) Several months later, he was diagnosed with HIV. (Id. ¶ 21 (citing Pl.'s Dep. 23:3-12).) Between 2008 and 2012, Plaintiff received both verbal and written coaching on five separate occasions for "poor reliability."5 (Id. ¶ 23 (citing Pl.'s Performance Report [*9]  7, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. L, Docket Entry No. 58-12).)
Several months after Plaintiff's initial diagnosis, Defendant, through Sedgwick, applied for and was granted FMLA leave in response to his HIV diagnosis. (Id. ¶¶ 21-22.) In December of 2012, Defendant granted Plaintiff long-term disability leave for twenty-eight months due to "symptoms he experienced as a result of his myelopathy and other nerve related issues that were associated with his HIV status." (Id. ¶ 25.)

ii. April to September 2015 — Plaintiff's disciplinary history following return from long-term disability leave
At the conclusion of Plaintiff s long-term disability in April of 2015, Plaintiff returned to "active employment status." (Id. ¶ 26.) However, because Plaintiff had been on leave for twenty-eight months, he did not have enough accrued service time to be eligible for FMLA leave. (Id. ¶ 27 (citing Leave Policy 3).) Plaintiff's reliability issues persisted after he returned to work from disability leave. (Def.'s 56.1 ¶¶ 26-28.) Plaintiff was late to work on May 19, June 7-9, and June 28-30, 2015; he had unexcused absences on August 8-10 and August 28-30, 2015; and he missed a flight on June 13, 2015, for [*10]  which he was scheduled to work. (Def.'s 56.1 ¶¶ 28-29.) Plaintiff advised FSM Giacomo Suriano that he missed his flight because of difficulties with his commute, explaining that he "lost track of time," and as a result, failed to call In Flight Scheduling within three hours of his assigned flight as required under the Absence Policy. (Id. ¶ 29.)
In response to these reliability issues, on June 18, July 16, and August 17, 2015, Plaintiff met with managers for verbal coaching. (Id. 130 (citing Pl.'s Performance Report).) In addition, on September 8, 2015, Plaintiff received written coaching from FSM Suriano and FSM Kris Sooknanan regarding his "poor reliability during the prior six months." (Id. ¶ 31.) The written coaching advised Plaintiff that he would be required to provide a doctor's certification for any additional absences in the subsequent six-month period and that failure to provide certification and improve his reliability would result in additional disciplinary action. (Id.)

iii. October 2015 — Plaintiff's First Intermittent FMLA Leave
On October 11, 2015, Plaintiff failed to "timely notify" In Flight Scheduling that he would be absent from work through October 13, and, as a result, [*11]  Plaintiff's October 11 absence was coded CFSM. (Id. ¶ 41.) On October 12, 2015, Plaintiff contacted Sedgwick and initiated the process of applying for FMLA leave. (Id. ¶ 42; Sedgwick Notes for Plaintiff's 2015-2016 FMLA Leave 38, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. T, Docket Entry No. 58-20.) On October 13, 2015, Plaintiff met with FSM Suriano regarding the October 11 policy violation and as a result of that conversation, FSM Suriano revised the absence code from CFSM to "a UPS (which stands for 'unpaid sick')." (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 43.) Also on October 13, 2015, "Tracy Kohn, the Sedgwick Leave Advocate assigned to Plaintiff's FMLA leave application," provided Plaintiff with the "leave application packet, including the Medical Certification Form and the Notice of Rights and Responsibilities." (Id. ¶ 44.) The leave application packet indicated that Plaintiff would be responsible for notifying his FSM of any absences, including absences covered under the FMLA, and that Plaintiff would "be required to provide Sedgwick with periodic updates about his status during his leave." (Id.)
Plaintiff was again absent from work on October 23 through 25, 2015, but the parties dispute whether Plaintiff submitted [*12]  the necessary doctor's certification to cover these days under his FMLA leave. (Id. ¶ 45; Pl.'s Counter 56.1 ¶ 45.) Plaintiff contends that "[i]n October [of] 2015, [he] submitted his doctor's certifications to Sedgwick," that Sedgwick acknowledged that Plaintiff "reported his condition requiring FMLA approval on October 12, 2015," and that he missed work for the same condition later that same month. (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 ¶ 45.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not contact Sedgwick to have his October 23-25 absences covered by the FMLA, (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 45), but that rather, on October 26, 2015, "Plaintiff's physician submitted a medical certification to Sedgwick in connection with Plaintiff's FMLA application," which stated that Plaintiff should be granted intermittent FMLA leave for "urgent or regularly scheduled clinic visits" from November of 2015 to November of 2016, with an "expected frequency of one to two episodes per year and two treatment visits per year," (id. ¶ 46 (citing Pl.'s Medical Certification, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. Q, Docket Entry No. 58-17)).
On October 27, 2017, Kohn mailed Plaintiff a letter notifying him of deficiencies in the medical certification submitted [*13]  on October 26 and indicating that the following corrections should be made:
• The certification did not indicate that Plaintiff would need leave for missed time due to flare-ups of his condition;
• The certification only indicated that Plaintiff would need to use leave beginning in November 2015, even though Plaintiff had absences in October 2015;
• The certification only indicated that Plaintiff would need to leave for two trips per year, and Plaintiff had already been absent for two trips in October 2015.
(Id. ¶ 47 (citing Letter from Kohn to Pl. dated Oct. 27, 2015, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. R, Docket Entry No. 58-18).) The letter further indicated that Plaintiff should have his doctor amend the certification and resubmit it to Sedgwick by November 11, 2015. (Id. ¶ 48.) Kohn reiterated this request to Plaintiff on October 27, 2015, and November 6, 2016, but Plaintiff did not provide Sedgwick with the additional information.6 (Id. ¶¶ 49-50.) As a result, by letter dated November 19, 2015, Sedgwick notified Plaintiff that his intermittent FMLA leave was approved from November 1, 2015, until October 31, 2016, (the "First Intermittent FMLA Leave"), but that his absences on October [*14]  11-13, 2015, and October 23-25, 2015, would not be covered by FMLA due to his failure to submit the medical certification supporting leave for those dates. (Id. ¶¶ 51-52 (citing Letter from Kohn to Pl. dated Nov. 19, 2015, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. S, Docket Entry No. 58-19; Pl.'s Counter 56.1 ¶ 51.) Plaintiff did not appeal Kohn's determination regarding the October 11-13, 2015, and October 23-25, 2015, absences.7 (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 53.)

iv. November and December 2016 — Corrective Action Notice
Plaintiff was again absent from work from November 22-24, 2015. (Id. ¶ 54.) Defendant contends that, although Plaintiff was required pursuant to the September 8, 2015 written coaching to provide a "doctor's certification" for any subsequent absences, Plaintiff did not provide certification or contact Sedgwick to have his absence covered by FMLA leave. (Id.) Plaintiff maintains that he "provided a [doctor's] certification and was approved for FMLA leave for this time period by Sedgwick, [and that] Sedgwick's letter certified the period from November 1, 2015, through October 31, 2016. (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 ¶ 54 (citing Sedgwick Correspondence 124-28, annexed to Pl.'s Opp'n as Ex. B, Docket Entry [*15]  No. 64-2).)
On November 1 and 28, 2015, Plaintiff was late to work. (Def.'s 56.1 ¶¶ 50, 55.) The parties dispute whether Plaintiff's lateness was covered under his First Intermittent FMLA Leave.8 (Compare id., with Pl.'s Counter 56.1 ¶¶ 54-55.) In addition, on December 14, 2015, Plaintiff failed to cover his flight assignment and advised FSM Suriano that he "missed this flight because of a weather condition that delayed his arrival to [John F. Kennedy ('JFK')] International Airport." (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 56.) The absence was accordingly coded as FCOK because Plaintiff did not timely report that he would not make the flight.9 (Id. (citing Pl.'s Email to Suriano, dated December 15, 2015, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. U, Docket Entry No. 58-21).)
On December 29, 2015, finding Plaintiff had not sufficiently improved his reliability after the September 8, 2015 written performance review, FSM Suriano again met with Plaintiff and this time, issued a Corrective Action Notice for poor reliability. (Id. ¶ 57.) At this meeting, Plaintiff informed Defendant's Base Director David Gilmartin and FSM Suriano of his HIV status and explained that his condition is manageable with medication. (Id. ¶ 60.) Plaintiff [*16]  contends that following his disclosure to Director Gilmartin and FSM Suriano, he understood that Defendant retroactively approved the absences under his FMLA leave. (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 60.) Defendant contends that, to the contrary, Plaintiff "did not request an accommodation for any disability during this meeting." (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 60.) During this meeting, Director Gilmartin and Plaintiff also discussed Plaintiff's request to transfer his base airport from New York to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport ("DTW") to avoid future issues with his commute. (Id. ¶ 61.)

v. January 2016 to March 2017 — Final Corrective Action Notice
On February 1, 2016, Director Gilmartin and FSM Suriano approved Plaintiff's transfer to DTW despite the issuance of the Corrective Action Notice two months earlier. (Id. ¶ 63.)
On March 6-8 and March 25-27, 2015, Plaintiff was absent from work but did not apply to have this absence approved under the First Intermittent FMLA Leave as required under Defendant's Leave Policy. (Id ¶¶ 64-65.) On April 16, 2016, Plaintiff received informal verbal coaching from FSM Charlotte Ling regarding this seven-day absence. (Id. ¶ 66.)
On May 1, 2016, Plaintiff transferred base [*17]  airports from DTW back to JFK where he was assigned to FSM John Marsh's team. (Id. ¶ 67.) At some unspecified time, Plaintiff disclosed his HIV status to FSM Marsh and FSM Marsh encouraged Plaintiff to use his FMLA leave to cover his absences.10 (Id ¶¶ 69-70.) On September 4-7, 2016, Plaintiff was again absent from work and did not apply to have his absence covered by the First Intermittent FMLA Leave. (Id. ¶ 72.) On September 7, 2016, FSM Marsh gave Plaintiff an informal verbal coaching, although the incident rendered Plaintiff eligible for a Final Corrective Action Notice. (Id. ¶ 73.) On October 28, 2016, Plaintiff was absent from work and failed to have his absence covered by the First Intermittent FMLA Leave. (Id. ¶ 76.) On that day, FSM Marsh gave Plaintiff an informal verbal coaching and warned Plaintiff that his next "unexcused absences would result in further performance development." (Id. ¶ 77.) FSM Marsh also "encouraged Plaintiff to get his absences approved by Sedgwick." (Id.)
On November 1, 2016, Sedgwick advised Plaintiff that "his FMLA leave had expired," and that "any absences after November 1, 2016, would not [be] eligible for FMLA leave." (Id. ¶ 78 (citing Letter [*18]  from Kohn to Pl. dated Nov. 1, 2016 ("2016 Kohn Letter"), annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. R, Docket Entry No. 58-27)) The letter further notes that Plaintiff had not exercised his FMLA rights during the covered period, indicating that Plaintiff had "used approximately [zero] days of [FMLA] leave for this claim." (2016 Kohn Letter.)
Plaintiff was again absent from work from February 26 to March 3, 2017. (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 79.) On March 23, 2017, FSM Carla Boudier met with Plaintiff and issued a Final Corrective Action Notice, citing eighteen "unexcused absences."11 (Id. ¶ 80.) The parties dispute whether Plaintiff had sought to cover any of these absences under the First Intermittent FMLA Leave. (Id.; Final Corrective Action Notice dated Mar. 23, 2017 ("Final Corrective Action Notice"), annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. BB, Docket Entry No. 58-28.) Plaintiff told FSM Boudier that he was in the process of obtaining "FMLA approval for his February 6 through March 3[, 2017] absences." (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 81.) FSM Boudier indicated that "if [Plaintiff] was approved for FMLA leave for the dates in question, the decision to issue the [Final Corrective Action Notice] would be revisited." (Id.) Plaintiff [*19]  disputes Defendant's allegation that he failed to contact Sedgwick regarding the medical reasons for these absences, and contends that "[m]any of the dates" in the Final Corrective Action Notice "should have been excused," as Plaintiff had submitted "doctor's certifications" indicating that he was receiving treatment related to his HIV on those dates.12 (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 In 79-80 (citing Sedgwick Correspondence 194-95).)

vi. April to October 2017 — Plaintiff's Second Intermittent Leave
Plaintiff contacted Sedgwick on April 1, 2017, to apply for a second intermittent FMLA leave. (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 84.) In response, Kohn provided Plaintiff with the relevant documents and followed up with him by telephone on April 3, 2017. (Id. ¶¶ 85-86.) During this call, Plaintiff informed Kohn that he had received a Final Corrective Action Notice due to medical-related absences and asked whether the FMLA could be applied retroactively to cover those absences. (Id. ¶ 86.) Kohn explained that Sedgwick could retroactively apply his FMLA leave to cover absences thirty days prior to the application of approved leave, if his doctor provided the necessary paperwork by "indicat[ing] on the medical certification [*20]  that the start date for his leave was the date of the first absence." (Id. (citing Sedgwick Notes for Pl.'s 2017 FMLA Leave 7, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. HH, Docket Entry No. 58-34).)
On April 20, 2017, Plaintiff's doctor submitted a certification stating that "Plaintiff was expected to have flare-ups of his condition with a frequency of six days per month and two to four treatments per year (May 4, 2017, July 15, 2017, September 15, 2017, and October 31, 2017)," and indicating that Plaintiff should be approved for intermittent FMLA leave from April 1, 2017 to October 1, 2017. (Id. ¶ 87.) On April 24, 2017, Kohn notified Plaintiff that his letter contained the following deficiencies:
• The certification did not set forth the job functions that Plaintiff would be unable to perform due to flare-ups;
• The certification set forth the time that Plaintiff would miss work due to flare-ups as a number of days, however, for flight attendants, absences had to be set forth as a number of trips.
(Id. ¶ 88 (first citing Letter from Kohn to Pl. 1-2, dated Apr. 24, 2017 ("2017 Kohn Letter"), annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. EE, Docket Entry No. 58-31; and then citing Sedgwick Notes for Pl.'s 2017 [*21]  FMLA Leave 17-18).) The 2017 Kohn Letter did not notify Plaintiff that his doctor's certification failed to retroactively cover the absences cited in the Final Corrective Action Notice. (2017 Kohn Letter.)
On April 26, 2017, Plaintiff's doctor submitted a revised medical certification addressing the issues identified by Kohn, (id ¶ 89), and on April 27, 2017, Sedgwick approved "Plaintiff for intermittent FMLA leave from April 1, 2017 to October 1, 2017 with a frequency of three episodes per month and four treatments per year," (the "Second Intermittent FMLA Leave"). (Id. ¶ 90.) Sedgwick notified Plaintiff that he was still required to comply with Defendant's absence notification procedures, "including notifying [In Flight Scheduling] of any absence more than three hours prior to sign-in." (Id.) Plaintiff used his FMLA leave to cover fifty days between April of 2017 and August of 2017.13 (Id. ¶ 93.)
On April 30, June 4, and June 24, 2017, during Plaintiff's Second Intermittent FMLA Leave, Plaintiff was absent from work and failed to comply with Defendant's Absence Policy. (Id. ¶¶ 95, 98-99.) However, Plaintiff was "approved to use FMLA leave on [these] date[s] and was not issued an FCOK [*22]  on his schedule." (Id.) On May 26, 2017, Plaintiff failed to cover a flight from Charlotte Airport and was absent from work from May 26 through 28, 2017, and received an informal coaching from FSM Marsh as a result of these absences, even though he "had previously been advised that further unexcused absences could result in a review for termination." (Id. ¶ 97.) In addition, these absences were coded as "MTO" or "Managed Time Out" instead of FCOK. (Id.)
On July 6, 2017, Plaintiff violated Defendant's Absence Policy by failing to notify Defendant of his absence within three hours of the flight assignment. (Id. ¶ 100.) Although, on July 18, Sedgwick approved Plaintiff's request to use FMLA to cover the absence, (Sedgwick Notes for Pl.'s 2017 FMLA Leave 57), on August 9, 2017, "Plaintiff received an FCOK for violation [of Defendant]'s Absence Notification Policy" and an informal verbal coaching from FSM Marsh regarding the absence and violation of Defendant's policy. (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 100.)

c. Plaintiffs disability leave and resignation
On October 5, 2017, during a call with Sedgwick, Plaintiff stated that he would not be renewing his FMLA leave and would instead be pursuing his disability [*23]  leave claim. (Id. ¶ 103.) Sedgwick notified Plaintiff on October 19, 2017, that his disability leave application was approved from September 3, 2017 through October 22, 2017. (Id. ¶ 105.) On November 8, 2017, Sedgwick extended Plaintiffs disability leave through January 12, 2018. (Id. ¶ 107.)
On December 8, 2017, Plaintiff tendered his resignation to FSM Shirley Whitehead, stating as follows:
I have thought very long and very, very hard about this but I am writing to you for the last time on my email. I would like you to accept this as my formal resignation effective immediately. I have been out of work for several months and treatment and appointments are not getting any easier. I have been out since approximately the end of [A]ugust technically September 11th but this has been to[o] tough for me for too long. I have had to go through getting my car repossessed and still try to make it to doctor appointments. Now I am facing eviction from my apartment and still my condition I am going through is not showing any signs of improvement. I want to thank you and everyone else at [the company] for the time I have spent with all of you. I have thoroughly enjoyed working as a flight attendant [*24]  and will miss it, so very much. However due to money, and everything going on in my life right now I need to make the decision to part ways.
(Id. ¶ 108 (second alteration in original) (citing Email from Pl. to Whitehead dated Dec. 8, 2017, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. NN, Docket Entry No. 58-40).)
On February 17, 2018, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the "EEOC"). (Charge of Discrimination, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. OO, Docket Entry No. 58-41.)

II. Discussion

a. Standard of review
Summary judgment is proper only when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Wandering Dago, Inc. v. Destito, 879 F.3d 20, 30 (2d Cir. 2018); see also Cortes v. MTA N.Y.C. Transit, 802 F.3d 226, 230 (2d Cir. 2015). The court must "'constru[e] the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party' and "'resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.' Lenzi v. Systemax, Inc., 944 F.3d 97, 107 (2d Cir. 2019) (first quoting VKK Corp. v. Nat'l Football League, 244 F.3d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 2001); and then quoting Johnson v. Goord, 445 F.3d 532, 534 (2d Cir. 2006)). The role of the court "is not to resolve disputed questions of fact but only to determine whether, as to any material issue, a genuine factual dispute exists." Rogoz v. City of Hartford, 796 F.3d 236, 245 (2d Cir. 2015) (first quoting Kaytor v. Elec. Boat Corp., 609 F.3d 537, 545 (2d Cir. 2010); and then citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A genuine issue of [*25]  fact exists when there is sufficient "evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. The "mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" is not sufficient to defeat summary judgment. Id. The court's function is to decide "whether, after resolving all ambiguities and drawing all inferences in favor of the non-moving party, a rational juror could find in favor of that party." Pinto v. Allstate Ins. Co., 221 F.3d 394, 398 (2d Cir. 2000).

b. Plaintiff's FMLA and ADA claims are partially barred by the statute of limitations
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's FMLA and ADA claims are partially time-barred. (Def.'s Mem. 6, 19.) Plaintiff has not responded to Defendant's arguments regarding the impact of the statute of limitations on his claims under the FMLA and ADA. (See generally Pl.'s Opp'n.)

i. Plaintiff's FMLA claims regarding conduct that occurred on or before April 23, 2016 are time-barred
Defendant contends that "Plaintiff's FMLA claims are time-barred to the extent they are based on alleged events occurring prior to April 13, 2016," because Plaintiff commenced this action on April 13, 2018. (Def.'s Mem. 7.) Specifically, Defendant argues that "the allegations concerning Plaintiff's return to work after a two-year disability leave, [*26]  the performance development he received in 2015 (including verbal and written coachings), his application for FMLA leave in October 2015, which was . . . granted in November 2015, and his receipt of a [Corrective Action Notice] in December 2015," all occurred prior to April 13, 2016 and are time-barred. (Id.)
"FMLA claims are generally subject to a two-year statute of limitations, but that limitations period extends to three years when the violation is 'willful."' Offor v. Mercy Med. Ctr., 676 F. App'x 51, 53 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Porter v. N.Y. Univ. Sch. of Law, 392 F.3d 530, 531 (2d Cir. 2004) (per curiam)); see also 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1) ("[A]n action may be brought under [the FMLA] not later than [two] years after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought.").14
The Court finds that because Plaintiff commenced this action on April 13, 2018, and has not alleged any willful conduct by Defendant, Plaintiff's FMLA claims based on any alleged violations more than two years prior to the filing of the Complaint, April 13, 2016, are time-barred. See Lewis v. N.Y.C. Police Dep't, 908 F. Supp. 2d 313, 325 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) ("[T]he record indicates that [the] [p]laintiff's last request for FMLA leave was on March 19, 2007, which was denied on September 19, 2007; [p]laintiff's December 17, 2009 complaint filed here is therefore two months past the statutory [*27]  deadline and untimely."), aff'd, 537 F. App'x 11 (2d Cir. 2013); Ungerleider v. Fleet Mortg. Grp. of Fleet Bank, 329 F. Supp. 2d 343, 362 (D. Conn. 2004) ("The FMLA requires that 'an action . . . be brought under this section not later than [two] years after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought.' 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1). The statute of limitations period began running at the very latest when [the defendant] accepted [the plaintiff's] resignation on May 24, 2000. She did not amend her complaint to add a FMLA claim until May 5, 2003, nearly a year after the statute of limitation had run.").
Accordingly, Plaintiff's FMLA claims based on alleged events occurring prior to April 13, 2016, are barred by the statute of limitations.

ii. Plaintiff's ADA claims based on conduct prior to April 20, 2017 are time-barred
Defendant argues that plaintiff's ADA claims are partially time-barred as "Plaintiff's disability claims under the ADA are subject to a 300-day statute of limitations running backward from the date that Plaintiff filed his charge with the EEOC." (Def.'s Mem. 19.) Because Plaintiff filed his complaint with the EEOC on February 14, 2018, (Charge of Discrimination), Defendant maintains that Plaintiff's claims must be predicated on events that occurred within the statutory [*28]  period. (Def.'s Mem. 19.)
"A plaintiff who wishes to pursue an ADA claim of discrimination or retaliation must file a complaint with the EEOC within 300 days of the allegedly unlawful act." Osby v. City of New York, 748 F. App'x 375, 377 (2d Cir. 2018) (citing Harris v. City of New York, 186 F.3d 243, 247-48 (2d Cir. 1999); see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e). Failure to timely file with the EEOC renders the underlying claim time-barred in federal court. Osby, 748 F. App'x at 377 (citing Harris, 186 F.3d at 248); see also McPartlan-Hurson v. Westchester Cmty. Coll., 804 F. App'x 41, 43 (2d Cir. 2020) ("Claims concerning discrete acts outside this [300-day] window will be time barred." (citing Nat'l R. R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002))).
Because Plaintiff filed a complaint with the EEOC on February 14, 2018, (Charge of Discrimination), any alleged conduct outside the limitations period — before April 20, 2017 — cannot serve as a basis for an ADA discrimination claim. See Ayazi v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 586 F. App'x 600, 602 (2d Cir. 2014) (upholding dismissal of discrimination claim where the plaintiff's claims "fell well outside the ADA's 300-day limitations period" (first citing Butts v. N.Y. Dep't of Hous. Pres. & Dev., 990 F.2d 1397, 1401 (2d Cir. 1993); and then citing Zerilli-Edelglass v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 333 F.3d 74, 80 (2d Cir. 2003))); Hoffman v. Williamsville Sch. Dist., 443 F. App'x 647, 650 (2d Cir. 2011) (dismissing an ADA discrimination claim because the complaint "fail[ed] to allege a violation of the ADA that [fell] within the 300-day window"); Bartone v. Mattera, No. 15-CV-6362, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152659, 2016 WL 6537957, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 3, 2016) ("Because [p]laintiff has not alleged a violation of the ADA within the 300-day statutory filing period, [p]laintiff's claim under the ADA is dismissed.").
Accordingly, Plaintiff's ADA claims regarding Defendant's conduct [*29]  prior to April 20, 2017, including the Final Corrective Action Notice issued on March 23, 2017, are time-barred.

c. FMLA interference and retaliation claims

i. FMLA interference
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a claim of FMLA interference because "it is undisputed that Plaintiff was granted and permitted to use FMLA leave throughout his employment with [Defendant]." (Def's Mem. 7.) In addition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has abandoned his FMLA interference claim by failing to present any counterargument in his opposition to address Defendant's statement that Plaintiff was never denied FMLA leave when requested. (Def's Reply 3.)
In his opposition to the motion Plaintiff argues that "[t]here were several clear interferences with [his] FMLA in spring and summer of 2017." (Pl.'s Opp'n 5.) In support, Plaintiff argues that although "Sedgwick's records ... show it advised Plaintiff in early April that it would retroactively cover Plaintiff for absences once doctor's certifications were received," and that Defendant was aware of Plaintiff's medical condition and Plaintiff informed Director Gilmartin and FSM Marsh "that his February absences (which were the dates that initiated [*30]  the [Final Corrective Action Notice] discipline) were for medical reasons," the Final Corrective Action Notice was never revisited or removed from Plaintiff's file. (Id. at 5-6.)
"The FMLA gives eligible employees an 'entitlement' to twelve weeks per year of unpaid leave '[b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.'" Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 174 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D)); see also Greenberg v. State Univ. Hosp., 838 Fed. Appx. 603, 605, 2020 WL 7380245, at *1 (2d Cir. 2020) (same). It '"creates a private right of action to seek both equitable relief and money damages against any employer ...' should that employer 'interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of' FMLA rights.'" Id. (quoting Nev. Dep't Hum. Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 724-25, 123 S. Ct. 1972, 155 L. Ed. 2d 953 (2003)). "Under the FMLA, an employer may neither interfere with an employee's exercise of this entitlement nor retaliate against an employee for exercising this entitlement." Greenberg, 638 F. App'x at 605, 2020 WL 7380245, at *1 (citing Woods v. START Treatment & Recovery Ctrs., Inc., 864 F.3d 158, 166 (2d Cir. 2017)); see also Kelly v. Hartford Fin. Servs. Grp., Inc., 818 F. App'x 83, 84 (2d Cir. 2020) ("FMLA claims come in at least two varieties: interference and retaliation." (quoting Woods, 864 F.3d at 166)); Sista, 445 F.3d at 175 ("rejecting claims of interference and retaliation."). "[A]n employee brings an 'interference' claim when her employer has prevented or otherwise impeded the employee's ability to exercise rights under the FMLA." Woods, 864 F.3d at 166 (citing Graziadio v. Culinary Inst. of Am., 817 F.3d 415, 424 (2d Cir. 2016)) ("To succeed on a claim of FMLA interference, [*31]  a plaintiff must establish that the defendant denied or otherwise interfered with a benefit to which she was entitled under the FMLA."); Graziadio, 817 F.3d at 424 ("[T]o prevail on a claim of interference with her FMLA rights, a plaintiff must establish: 1) that [he] is an eligible employee under the FMLA; 2) that the defendant is an employer as defined by the FMLA; 3) that [he] was entitled to take leave under the FMLA; 4) that [he] gave notice to the defendant of [his] intention to take leave; and 5) that [he] was denied benefits to which [he] was entitled under the FMLA.").
The parties only dispute whether Plaintiff was denied benefits to which he was entitled under the FMLA. Therefore, the Court considers whether in failing to retroactively cover the "February absences" cited in the Final Corrective Action Notice based on the doctor's certification, (see Pl.'s Opp'n 5-6), Defendant wrongly denied Plaintiff benefits under the FMLA.
As discussed above, when Plaintiff contacted Sedgwick on April 1, 2017, to apply for a second intermittent FMLA leave, (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 84), he informed Kohn that he had received a Final Corrective Action Notice due to medical-related absences, (id. ¶ 86). Kohn explained that Sedgwick [*32]  could retroactively apply his FMLA leave to cover absences thirty days prior to the application of approved leave, if his doctor provided the necessary paperwork by "indicat[ing] on the medical certification that the start date for his leave was the date of the first absence [cited in the Final Corrective Action Notice]." (Id. (citing Sedgwick Notes for Pl.'s 2017 FMLA Leave 8).) Plaintiff's doctor subsequently submitted a letter indicating that Plaintiff should be approved for intermittent FMLA leave from April 1, 2017 to October 1, 2017. (Id. ¶ 87.) Citing various deficiencies with this letter, Sedgwick requested additional information from Plaintiff but failed to advise him that the doctor's certification would not cover the dates cited in the Final Corrective Action Notice. (Id. 188.) Plaintiff submitted the additional information requested and Sedgwick granted the FMLA leave for the period specified by Plaintiff's doctor — April 1, 2017 to October 1, 2017. (Id. 190). Because the record indicates that Plaintiff never requested leave for the absences cited in the Final Corrective Action Notice by providing a doctor's certification for those dates, there is no evidence that Defendant [*33]  interfered with Plaintiff's rights under the FMLA. Moreover, Plaintiff understood the process for taking FMLA leave as he successfully used his Second Intermittent FMLA Leave to cover fifty days between April of 2017 and August of 2017. (Id. 193.) There is likewise nothing in the record to indicate that Sedgwick would not have retroactively approved the absences cited in the Final Corrective Action Notice had Plaintiff provided a doctor's certification for the relevant dates as Kohn initially advised. (See Sedgwick Notes for Pl.'s 2017 FMLA Leave 8 (advising Plaintiff that Sedgwick can "usually go back [thirty] days in the past . . . [and] to have [General Practitioner] fill out forms and acquire new information from specialists").)
Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant did not interfere with Plaintiff's FMLA rights by approving the Second Intermittent FMLA Leave starting on the date indicated on the doctor's certification — April 1, 2017 — as opposed to the date of Plaintiff's first absence cited in the Final Corrective Action Notice. See Sefovic v. Mem'l Sloan Kettering Cancer Ctr., No. 15-CV-5792, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135217, 2017 WL 3668845, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 23, 2017) (finding that "[the] [d]efendants are entitled to summary judgment on [the plaintiff's] FMLA interference claim because [the plaintiff] has [*34]  failed to present evidence ... that [the] [d]efendants impeded him in exercising his rights under the FMLA. All evidence indicates that the process for taking leave was well known and established. Certainly, [the plaintiff] had no trouble requesting or taking his FMLA leave; and he took all of the twelve weeks of leave he was entitled to under the FMLA" (citation omitted)).
Nor did Defendant interfere with Plaintiff's FMLA rights by issuing the Final Corrective Action Notice based on Plaintiff's pattern of violating Defendant's Absence Policy or by conditioning removal of the Final Corrective Action Notice on Plaintiff's compliance with the Leave Policy as Plaintiff did not seek to cover the dates cited in the Final Corrective Action Notice under his Second Intermittent FMLA Leave. See Logan v. Saks & Co., No. 18-CV-9023, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178126, 2020 WL 5768322, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2020) ("The 'FMLA is not a shield to protect employees from legitimate disciplinary action by their employers if their performance is lacking in some manner unrelated to their FMLA leave.'" (quoting Hill v. N.Y.C. Hous. Auth, 220 F. Supp. 3d 499, 506 (S.D.N.Y. 2016)).
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim.

ii. FMLA retaliation
Defendant argues that "Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case" of retaliation. [*35]  (Def.'s Mem. 10-11.) In support, Defendant maintains that: (1) there "are long periods of his employment during which Plaintiff did not exercise his FMLA rights"; (2) "he cannot identify any adverse employment action that followed an exercise of such right"; and (3) he is unable to identify any "facts giving rise to an inference of retaliatory intent." (Id. at 11.)
Plaintiff argues that the repeated informal coaching he received was "materially adverse" because it served as a basis for the Corrective Action Notice and Final Corrective Action Notice, (Pl.'s Opp'n 10), and that as a result of the Final Corrective Action Notice, FSM Marsh denied his request to transfer to "a different position with less travel so that Plaintiff could be closer to his home base and near his doctors," (id. at 11-13).15 In addition, although Plaintiff testified during his deposition that the Corrective Action Notice did not affect his wages or ability to bid on Defendant's flights, (Pl.'s Dep. 121:22-122:7), he argues in his opposition to Defendant's motion that the Corrective Action Notice and Final Corrective Action Notice impacted his wages to the extent they prevented him from receiving a promotion, (Pl.'s [*36]  Counter 56.1 ¶ 82). For example, Plaintiff had expressed interest in joining the "Purser Program" — a higher-paying, "managerial program for Defendant's international flight attendants," (id ¶ 11) — but as a result of the Corrective Action Notice and Final Corrective Action Notice, Plaintiff was ineligible. (Pl.'s Counter 56.1 ¶42-13; Pl.'s Dep. 129:19-22.) Finally, Plaintiff argues that "[t]he close temporal proximity of the [Final Corrective Action Notice] very soon after Plaintiff's flare-up of his medical condition, combined with the fact that Plaintiff's managers knew Plaintiff had HIV and did not question the validity of his condition, raise an inference" of retaliatory intent on Defendant's behalf. (Pl.'s Opp'n 6.)
Retaliation claims under the FMLA "involve [] an employee actually exercising her rights or opposing perceived unlawful conduct under the FMLA and then being subjected to some adverse employment action by the employer." Blodgett v. 22 S. St. Operations, LLC, 828 F. App'x 1, 4 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoting Woods, 864 F.3d at 166). "At the summary judgment stage, retaliation claims brought pursuant to the FMLA are analyzed under the burden-shifting test set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)." Alexander v. Bd. of Educ. of City of N.Y., 648 F. App'x 118, 121 (2d Cir. 2016); Greenberg, 838 F. App'x at 605, 2020 WL 7380245, at *2 (citing Graziadio, 817 F.3d at 424).16 "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FMLA, [*37]  a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) [he] 'exercised rights protected under the FMLA'; (2) [he] 'was qualified for [his] position'; (3) [he] 'suffered an adverse employment action'; and (4) 'the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of retaliatory intent.'" Greenberg, 838 F. App'x at 606, 2020 WL 7380245, at *2 (quoting Potenza v. City of New York, 365 F.3d 165, 168 (2d Cir. 2004) (per curiam)).
If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to "demonstrate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions." Greenberg, 838 F. App'x at 606, 2020 WL 7380245, at *2 (quoting Graziadio, 817 F.3d at 429). The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the "proffered explanation is pretextual." Id. (quoting Graziadio, 817 F.3d at 429). The plaintiff may establish pretext '"by demonstrating weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered' reason or by providing evidence such that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the prohibited reason was a 'motivating factor' in the adverse employment action. Id. (citation omitted) (first quoting Graziadio, 817 F.3d at 430; and then quoting Woods, 864 F.3d at 168-69).

1. Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of retaliation
The parties do not dispute [*38]  that Plaintiff was qualified for his position, but the parties disagree as to (1) whether Plaintiff "exercised rights protected under the FMLA" within the statutory period;17 (2) whether Plaintiff "suffered an adverse employment action"; and (3) whether the adverse action "occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of retaliatory intent." (See Def.'s Mem. 10-18.)

A. Plaintiff exercised his FMLA rights
Defendant maintains that Plaintiff failed to exercise his rights under the FMLA because "although Plaintiff applied for FMLA leave in October [of] 2015 and was approved to use FMLA leave beginning in November [of] 2015, Plaintiff never used his approved leave and let his approval expire at the end of October [of] 2016." (Id. at 11; see also 2016 Kohn Letter.) Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff exercised his rights under the FMLA during his Second Intermittent Leave, which was approved from April 1, 2017 to October 1, 2017. (Id. at 8.)
In order to exercise rights protected under the FMLA, an employee must explicitly invoke his rights due to a qualifying illness or condition. See Hahn v. Off. & Prof'l Emps. Int'l Union, Local 153, No. 13-CV-946, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96581, 2016 WL 4120517, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2016) (citing Wahl v. County of Suffolk, 466 F. App'x 17, 20 (2d Cir. 2012)); see also Seitz v. N. Y. State, No. 18-CV-4149, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169680, 2019 WL 4805257, at *12 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2019) ("Plaintiff exercised her rights under the FMLA when she applied for FMLA [*39]  leave.").
The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the first prong of the prima facie case. Although the record indicates Plaintiff failed to follow Defendant's Leave Policy by providing doctors' certifications to cover each absence under the approved FMLA leave period, it is undisputed that Plaintiff formally requested the Second Intermittent FMLA Leave on April 1, 2017, (see id. ¶ 84 (first citing 2017 Kohn Letter 1; and then citing Sedgwick Notes for Plaintiff's 2017 FMLA Leave 1)), due to a qualifying medical condition. By making this formal request for leave, Plaintiff exercised his rights protected by the FMLA. See Dighello v. Thurston Foods, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 3d 5, 14 (D. Conn. 2018) ("In order to exercise rights under the FMLA, one must request FMLA leave due to a qualifying illness or condition." (citing Hahn, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96581, 2016 WL 4120517, at *5)); see also Ottley-Cousin v. MMC Holdings, Inc., No. 16-CV-577, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76229, 2019 WL 1994488, at *17 (E.D.N.Y. May 6, 2019) ("Plaintiff exercised rights protected under the FMLA when she requested and was granted leave in October of 2014."); cf. White v. Smiths Med. ASD, Inc., No. 15-CV-1501, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178060, 2017 WL 4868556, at *11 (D. Conn. Oct. 27, 2017) (finding that the plaintiff "did not exercise rights protected under the FMLA ... [as] it [was] undisputed that [the plaintiff] failed to contact Sedgwick [to request FMLA leave] . . . and give actual notice as required").

B. Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action
Defendant argues that Plaintiff did [*40]  not suffer an adverse employment action as "[t]he only employment actions that occurred within the statutory period are informal verbal coachings that Plaintiff received from his supervisors in April, September, and October [of] 2016; the [Final Corrective Action Notice] he received in March [of] 2017; and an informal verbal coaching in August [of] 2017." (Def's Mem. 12.) Defendant contends that "[n]one of these actions — the majority of which occurred before Plaintiff exercised any FMLA rights — rises to the level [of] an adverse action under the FMLA." (Id.)
Plaintiff argues that the informal verbal coachings qualify as adverse employment actions under the FMLA because: (1) "the history of informal coachings were used by Delta as the basis for its [Corrective Action Notice] and [Final Corrective Action Notice]," (Pl.'s Opp'n 10); (2) FSM "Marsh told Plaintiff he could not transfer or receive a disability accommodation while on probation for the [Final Corrective Action Notice], that was a material and direct consequence of the prior informal coachings that caused the [Final Corrective Action Notice]," (id.); (3) when FSM "Marsh gave Plaintiff a coaching in July [sic] 2017, he also [*41]  threatened to terminate Plaintiff if he received any further infractions" (id.); and (4) "[t]hese repeated coachings, which should not have been given at all, caused Plaintiff to resign from a hostile work environment," (id.).
For purposes of FMLA retaliation claims, an adverse employment action is "any action by the employer that is likely to dissuade a reasonable worker in the plaintiff's position from exercising his legal rights." Millea v. Metro-N. R.R., 658 F.3d 154, 164 (2d Cir. 2011); see also Sosa v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ, 819 F. App'x 30, 34 (2d. Cir. 2020) ("[A] plaintiff may recover for retaliation by 'show[ing] that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.'" (alterations in original) (quoting Davis-Garett v. Urban Outfitters, Inc., 921 F.3d 30, 43 (2d Cir. 2019))). "[T]he test is whether a 'reasonable' employee would be deterred, and does not take into consideration a plaintiff's 'unusual subjective feelings.'" Dearden v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC, No. 15-CV-7628, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149408, 2017 WL 4084049, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, 2017) (quoting Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68-69, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006)).18 '"[P]etty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners will not' give rise to actionable retaliation claims." Millea, 658 F.3d at 165 (alteration in original) (quoting Burlington, 548 U.S. at 68). "In determining whether conduct amounts to an adverse employment action, the alleged acts of retaliation need to [*42]  be considered both separately and in the aggregate, as even minor acts of retaliation can be sufficiently 'substantial in gross' as to be actionable."

In addition, "[a]dverse employment actions are not limited to 'pecuniary emoluments.'" Lovejoy—Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 223 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Preda v. Nissho Iwai Am. Corp., 128 F.3d. 789, 791 (2d Cir. 1997)) (concluding that negative evaluation letters were adverse actions for purposes of a retaliation claim); see also Kercado-Clymer v. City of Amsterdam, 370 F. App'x 238, 242 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding that counseling memorandums and disciplinary charges could dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination (citing Burlington, 548 U.S. at 57)); Wu v.

Feb. 7, 2020) ("A formal reprimand can be an adverse action for purposes of a [FMLA] retaliation claim, 'even when . . . the letter does not directly or immediately result in any loss of wages or benefits, and does not remain in the employment file permanently,' because 'it can reduce an employee's likelihood of receiving future bonuses, raises, and promotions, and it may lead the employee to believe (correctly or not) that his job is in jeopardy.'" (quoting Bowen-Hooks v. City of New York, 13 F. Supp. 3d 179, 227 (E.D.N.Y. 2014))); Weber v. City of New York, 973 F. Supp. 2d 227, 268 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (finding that a teacher's "unsatisfactory performance evaluations" qualified as adverse actions for purposes of a retaliation claim); Taylor v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., No. 11-CV-3582, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170917, 2012 WL 5989874, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2012) (finding that receipt of a unsatisfactory rating qualified as an adverse [*43]  action for retaliation purposes); Siddiqi v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosps. Corp., 572 F. Supp. 2d 353, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) ("[F]or the purposes of a retaliation claim, bad performance reviews are an adverse employment action.").
Although a Corrective Action Notice or a Final Corrective Action Notice does restrict an employee's ability to receive transfers, promotions, and special assignments, it does not directly impact an employee's pay, benefits, or ability to bid on flights. (See Def.'s 56.1 ¶¶ 11-12.) Accordingly, the Court finds that the Final Corrective Action Notice issued against Plaintiff on March 23, 2017, constitutes an adverse employment action as it could dissuade a reasonable worker from exercising their rights under the FMLA.19 (Id. ¶ 80 (citing Final Corrective Action Notice); Pl.'s Counter 56.1 ¶ 82); see Wu, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22641, 2020 WL 615626, at *14 ("A jury could appropriately conclude that the formal notices which [the plaintiff] received in October 2017 and in May, June, and July 2018 were sufficient to 'dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.' (quoting Bien-Aime v. Equity Residential, No. 15-CV-1485, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25036, 2017 WL 696695, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2017))). Likewise, although the informal verbal coachings Plaintiff received within the statutory period on April 16, 2016, September 7, 2016, October 28, 2016, May 28, 2017, and August 9, 2017, did not impact [*44]  Plaintiff's compensation or benefits, (see Def's 56.1 ¶ 9; Pl.'s Performance Report), Defendant relied on these coachings as the basis for subsequent written performance reviews and other more severe disciplinary action, (Pl.'s Opp'n 10 (citing Final Corrective Action Notice)). The Court therefore finds that under the circumstances of this case, these verbal performance reviews constitute adverse employment actions as they could dissuade a reasonable employee in Plaintiff's position from complaining of unlawful discrimination. (See Pl.'s Opp'n 8); see also Bowman v. NY State Hous. & Cmty. Renewal, No. 18-CV-11596, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44138, 2020 WL 1233701, at *7 (S.D.N.Y.

April 19, 2019) ("Unlike in a discrimination context, 'a negative performance review can constitute an adverse action for purposes of a retaliation claim . . . .'" (citing Cerni, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 539)).

C. Plaintiff has established an inference of retaliatory intent
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish an inference of retaliatory intent, because (1) "Plaintiffs issues with [*45]  reliability and [Defendant's] efforts to address the same pre-date Plaintiff's exercise of any FMLA rights in the timely period," (Def.'s Mem. 13-14); (2) "Plaintiff was approved to use FMLA leave throughout his employment, even when he failed to comply with [Defendant's] absence notification policies," (id. at 14); (3) "the record is replete with evidence that Plaintiffs supervisors encouraged him to apply for and use his FMLA leave," (id. at 15); (4) "Plaintiffs supervisors — including [FSM] Marsh — repeatedly chose to informally coach Plaintiff, even when more advanced forms of performance development were called for under Delta's Performance Development Policy," (id.); and (5) the timing of Defendant's disciplinary actions against Plaintiff "rebut[] any inference of retaliatory animus," (id.).
Plaintiff argues that the timing of the verbal performance reviews and the Final Corrective Action Notice create an inference of discrimination because: (1) Plaintiff received a verbal performance review from FSM Marsh on August 9, 2017, and Defendant coded his July 6, 2017 absence FCOK, even though the absence was approved by Sedgwick due to "extenuating circumstances to warrant the late [*46]  reporting of the absence," (Sedgwick Notes for Plaintiff's 2017 FMLA Leave 58); and (2) the Final Corrective Action Notice was issued "a week after [Plaintiff] had a flare-up of his myelopathy condition related to his HIV, which caused Plaintiff to be absent," (Pl.'s Opp'n 5). In support, Plaintiff contends that notwithstanding Sedgwick's approval of the July 6 absence, he was held accountable for violating Defendant's Absence Policy, (id. at 7), and further, that he informed Defendant and Sedgwick "that his February absences (which were the dates that initiated the [Final Corrective Action Notice] discipline)20 were for medical reasons," such that "[t]he close temporal proximity of the [Final Corrective Action Notice] very soon after Plaintiff's flare-up of his medical condition, combined with the fact that Plaintiff's managers knew Plaintiff had HIV and did not question the validity of his condition, raise an inference [of discrimination]," (id at 6).
A causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action can be shown either "(1) indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment, or through other circumstantial [*47]  evidence such as disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in similar conduct; or (2) directly, through evidence of retaliatory actions directed against the plaintiff by the defendant." Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 319 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Gordon v. N.Y. C. Bd of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000)). "Direct evidence may . . . include evidence of discriminatory statements or actions by employees who, while not the ultimate decisionmakers, have 'enormous influence in the decision-making process.' Emmanuel v. Cushman & Wakefield, Inc., No. 13-CV-2894, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113280, 2015 WL 5036970, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2015) (quoting Rose v. NY C. Bd. of Educ., 257 F.3d 156, 162 (2d Cir. 2001)). Indirect evidence may include a "showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse action." Colon v. Fashion Inst. of Tech., 983 F. Supp. 2d 277, 287 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting Manoharan v. Columbia Univ. Coll. of Physicians & Surgeons, 842 F.2d 590, 593 (2d Cir. 1988)); see also, e.g., Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2004) ("[T]he requirement that [the plaintiff] show a causal connection between his complaints and his termination is satisfied by the temporal proximity between the two." (collecting cases)); Nonnenmann v. City of New York, No. 02-CV-10131, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8966, 2004 WL 1119648, at *22 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2004) ("Causation can be established either indirectly by means of circumstantial evidence, for example, by showing that the protected activity was followed by adverse treatment in employment, or directly by evidence of retaliatory animus." (quoting Morris v. Lindau, 196 F.3d 102, 110 (2d Cir. 1999))).
"However, [w]here timing is the only basis for a claim of retaliation, and gradual adverse job actions began well before the plaintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an inference [*48]  of retaliation does not arise." Chung v. City Univ. of N.Y., 605 F. App'x 20, 23 (2d Cir. 2015) (alteration in original) (quoting Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance Am. Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir. 2001)); see also Lue v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 768 F. App'x 7, 10-11 (2d Cir. 2019) (affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment as to the plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim where the record showed that "[the] defendants' criticisms of [the plaintiff's] communication style and her response to feedback predated her complaints of discrimination" and there was no other "evidence of an intent to retaliate"); Martinez v. Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, 713 F. App'x 53, 57 (2d Cir. 2017) (finding that the plaintiff failed to show an inference of retaliation under Title VII where the plaintiff "began receiving performance reviews that noted her struggles with time and project management as early as . . . three years before [the plaintiff's] filing of the EEOC charges" because "[u]nder these circumstances, a reasonable jury could not conclude that [the defendant's] treatment of [the plaintiff] in the wake of her EEOC filing . . . was retaliatory as opposed to the culmination of 'gradual adverse job actions' that began three years prior to the alleged retaliatory event"); Elliot-Leach v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 710 F. App'x 449, 452 (2d Cir. 2017) ("Because [the plaintiff] had been disciplined for work absences before she requested FMLA leave, and because she relies only on temporal proximity to suggest retaliatory intent, her [*49]  retaliation claim fails."); Sotomayor v. City of New York, 713 F.3d 163, 164 (2d Cir. 2013) (finding no prima facie case of FMLA retaliation where the plaintiff began receiving negative evaluations in her disciplinary file before her application for FMLA leave); Powell v. Merrick Acad. Charter Sch., No. 16-CV-5315, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32810, 2018 WL 1135551, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2018) (finding no inference of retaliation where the complaint made "extensive allegations that both (1) suggest an obvious alternative explanation for the decision to fire her and (2) make clear that Plaintiff was subject to disciplinary action and demonstrably at risk of losing her job before she engaged in any identifiable protected activity"); Catanzaro v. City of New York, No. 10-CV-1825, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9623, 2011 WL 335648, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2011) (finding that the plaintiff cannot rely solely on temporal proximity to raise inference of retaliation where he was "demonstrably at risk" of adverse action prior to engaging in the protected activity).
Plaintiff cannot establish that the Final Corrective Action Notice was issued with retaliatory intent based on his Second Intermittent FMLA Leave because he began the leave application process "nine days after he received" the Final Corrective Action Notice.21 (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 84); see Pickett v. Baldwin Union Free Sch. Dist., No. 13-CV-3527, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40061, 2016 WL 1714928, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 2016) ("It is clear that "[t]here can be no inference of retaliatory animus where the adverse employment action occurred prior to the protected activity." (alteration in original) [*50]  (quoting Pinero v. Long Island State Veterans Home, 375 F. Supp. 2d 162, 168 (E.D.N.Y. 2005)); see also Slattery, 248 F.3d at 95 ("Where timing is the only basis for a claim of retaliation, and gradual adverse job actions began well before the plaintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an inference of retaliation does not arise."). However, the Court finds that the August 9, 2017 verbal performance review regarding Plaintiff's July 6, 2017 absence creates an inference of discriminatory intent as this disciplinary action was taken after Sedgwick approved Plaintiff's late-reported absence due to extenuating circumstances created by his medical condition. (See Pl.'s Performance Report 4; Sedgwick Notes for Plaintiff's 2017 FMLA Leave 57.) In addition, Defendant contravened its own Leave Policy, (see Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 40), by holding Plaintiff accountable for an FMLA covered absence by coding the absence FCOK, (Failure to Cover, Okay to Fly), issuing a verbal performance review, and indicating that "[t]he next occurrence, Late/MTO/CFSM/UPS will be a review for termination," (Pl.'s Performance Report 3).
The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation solely as to the August 9, 2017 verbal performance review, shifting the burden to Defendant [*51]  to establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action.

2. Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason
Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted regardless of whether Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case because Defendant can show legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the informal verbal coaching relating to Plaintiff's violations of Defendant's Absence Policy and for issuing the Final Corrective Action Notice. (Def.'s Mem. 16-17.)
"[A]n employer's explanation of its legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons must be 'clear and specific' . . . so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext." Bucalo v. Shelter Island Union Free Sch. Dist., 691 F.3d 119, 132 (2d Cir. 2012) (first quoting Mandell v. County of Suffolk, 316 F.3d 368, 381 (2d Cir. 2003); and then quoting Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255-56, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)); see also Milione v. City Univ. of N.Y., 567 F. App'x 38, 41 (2d Cir. 2014) (same) (quoting Dister v. Cont'l Grp., Inc., 859 F.2d 1108, 1115 (2d Cir. 1988)). "If the defendant proffers such a reason, the presumption of discrimination . . . drops out of the analysis, and the defendant will be entitled to summary judgment . . . unless the plaintiff can point to evidence that reasonably supports a finding of prohibited discrimination." Spiegel v. Schulmann, 604 F.3d 72, 80 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Dawson v. Bumble & Bumble, 398 F.3d 211, 216-17 (2d Cir. 2005), overruled on other grounds en banc by Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc., 883 F.3d 100 (2d Cir. 2018)).
As discussed above, Defendant maintains that all verbal coaching provided in 2016 "pertained to unexcused absences for which Plaintiff [*52]  did not seek to use his approved FMLA leave." (Def.'s Mem. 17 (citing Def.'s 56.1 ¶¶ 66, 73, 77).) With respect to the August 2017 verbal coaching, Defendant maintains that it "was only a reminder of the conditions that were set forth in his [Final Corrective Action Notice] (and [Corrective Action Notice]), including that further unexcused absences would result in a review for termination[, and] it had no additional effect on Plaintiff's employment." (Id.. (citing Def.'s 56.1 ¶¶ 80, 100).)
Defendant has satisfied its burden of production by showing a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action at issue. Having articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to show Defendant's reason was, in fact, pretext for discrimination. See Hua Lin v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 720 F. App'x 89, 90 (2d Cir. 2018) (citing Zann Kwan v. Andalex Grp. LLC, 737 F.3d 834, 845 (2d Cir. 2013)).

3. Pretext
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's stated reason for the August 9, 2017 verbal coaching is pretext because Defendant was aware that "the majority of Plaintiffs absences were legitimately related to Plaintiffs serious and life-threatening HIV condition." (Pl.'s Opp'n 8.) In addition, even though this absence was covered under Plaintiffs FMLA leave, Defendant reprimanded and threatened [*53]  Plaintiff with termination on August 9, 2017, for violating Defendant's Absence Policy on July 6, 2017. (Id.. at 9-10.)
A plaintiff may show pretext "by demonstrating weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate, [nondiscriminatory] reasons for its action. From such discrepancies, a reasonable juror could conclude that the explanations were a pretext for a prohibited reason." Graziadio, 817 F.3d at 430 (quoting Zann Kwan, 737 F.3d at 846); see also Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) ("Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is . . . one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive."); Doe v. Bd. of Educ. of Fallsburgh Cent. Sch. Dist., 63 F. App'x 46, 49-50 (2d Cir. 2003) ("Evidence that could permit a jury to believe that the defendant's proffered reasons are not believable can support an inference that they are pretexts for discrimination." (citing Reeves, 530 U.S. at 147)); Pediford-Aziz v. City of New York, 170 F. Supp. 3d 480, 486 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) ("From . . . 'implausibilities, inconsistencies, [and] contradictions in' the proffered reasons . . . , one 'could conclude that . . . explanations [are] pretext.'" (first alteration in original) (quoting Zann Kwan, 737 F.3d at 846)).
Under the circumstances of this case, the Court finds that there are inconsistencies and contradictions in Defendant's proffered reason for the adverse [*54]  employment action taken on August 9, 2017, establishing a triable issue of fact. First, it is undisputed that Defendant was aware of the unpredictable nature of Plaintiff's medical condition that made it impossible, at times, for Plaintiff to comply with Defendant's Absence Policy.22 (Pl.'s Dep. 64:19-65:11.) Second, Defendant's policy provides that it "does not hold flight attendants accountable for absences that are covered by an approved FMLA leave. In cases where performance development is issued based on absences that are subsequently approved for FMLA leave, [Defendant] will remove the performance development from an employee's file." (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 40 (first citing Gilmartin Dep. 20:1-6, 21:3-5, 40:23-41:21, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. B, Docket Entry No. 58-2; and then citing Marsh Dep. 15:17-16:6, annexed to Fleming Decl. as Ex. C, Docket Entry No. 58-3).) Defendant violated its own policy when it penalized Plaintiff for his July 6, 2017 absence by issuing the August 9, 2017 verbal coaching, even though Defendant was aware of the nature of Plaintiff's medical condition and even though the absence was covered under his FMLA leave "because there were extenuating circumstances [*55]  to warrant the late reporting of the absence." (Sedgwick Notes for Plaintiff's 2017 FMLA Leave 57.)
Under the circumstances, a reasonable jury could find that this inconsistency undermines the proffered reason for the verbal coaching and threatened termination, and that it was pretext for retaliatory intent. See Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd P'ship, 22 F.3d 1219, 1226-27 (2d Cir. 1994) (finding sufficient evidence of discriminatory intent where employer's treatment of plaintiff violated its own policy); Bonura v. Chase Manhattan Bank NA., 795 F.2d 276, 277 (2d Cir. 1986) (per curiam) (finding "evidence indicating that [the defendant] disregarded its internal Organization and Policy Guide" supported a finding of defendant's willful discrimination); Solomon v. Fordham Univ., No. 18-CV-4615, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46350, 2020 WL 1272617, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) ("[A] failure to follow an anti-discrimination policy can give rise to an inference of discrimination." (citing Collins v. Cohen Pontani Lieberman & Pavane, No. 04-CV-8983, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58047, 2008 WL 2971668, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2008)); Corona v. Clarins U.S.A., Inc., No. 17-CV-4438, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155862, 2019 WL 4393082, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2019) ("That a company ignores its own policies or procedures when it takes action against an employee can cast doubt on the good faith of the process." (citing Stern v. Trs. of Columbia Univ., 131 F.3d 305, 313 (2d Cir. 1997))); Infantolino v. Joint Indus. Bd. of Elec. Indus., 582 F. Supp. 2d 351, 361 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (finding that violations of protocol in the defendant's dealings with the plaintiff "support a conclusion that [the defendant's] asserted reason was actually a pretext"); see also Ledbetter v. Alltell Corp. Servs. Inc., 437 F.3d 717, 723 (8th Cir. 2006) ("An employer's failure to follow its own policies may support an inference of pretext." (quoting Floyd v. State of Mo. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 188 F.3d 932,937 (8th Cir. 1999))).
The Court therefore denies [*56]  Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim.

d. ADA claims
Defendant moves for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claims for failure to accommodate, constructive discharge, and retaliation under the ADA. (Def.'s Mem.) In support of its motion, Defendant argues that (1) Plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate fails as "he cannot satisfy his burden with regard to establishing the existence of a reasonable accommodation," (Def.'s Mem. 19-22); (2) Plaintiff fails to satisfy the "demanding" burden necessary to establish a claim of constructive discharge, (id. at 23-24); and (3) Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim fails for the same reason his FMLA retaliation claim fails as Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination, (id. at 22-23).
Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to accommodate his disability because (1) Defendant disciplined him for requesting FMLA leave and denied his request "for a different position with less travel so that [he] could be closer to his home base and near his doctors," (Pl.'s Sur-reply 1); and (2) Defendant's rationale for denying his request to transfer — that "he was on probation . . . after receiving [*57]  a Corrective Action Notice and Final Corrective Action Notice" — violates the ADA, (id. at 2; see also Pl.'s Dep. 84:11-24).
ADA employment discrimination and retaliation claims are subject to the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Flieger v. E. Suffolk BOCES, 693 F. App'x 14,18 (2d Cir. 2017) ("[T]o establish a prima facie case, the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that: `(1) [his] employer is subject to the ADA; (2) [he] was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) [he] was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of [the] job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) [he] suffered [an] adverse employment action because of [his] disability." (quoting Sista, 445 F.3d at 169); see also Miceli v. Mehr, 830 F. App'x 63, 64-65 (2d Cir. 2020) (same); Pistello v. Bd of Educ. Canastota Cent. Sch. Dist., 808 F. App'x 19, 21 (2d Cir. 2020) ("To make out a prima facie case of retaliation under [the ADA], a plaintiff 'must show that: (1) [he] engaged in an activity protected by the[se statutes]; (2) the employer was aware of this activity; (3) the employer took adverse employment action against [him]; and (4) a causal connection exists between the alleged adverse action and the protected activity.'" (third alteration in original) (quoting Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. 2002))). "A plaintiff's burden to establish an initial prima facie case is, by design, 'minimal and de minimis.'" Kelleher v. Fed A. Cook Inc., 939 F.3d 465, 468 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting [*58]  Woodman v. WWOR—TV, Inc., 411 F.3d 69, 76 (2d Cir. 2005)); Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2008) (holding that a plaintiff's burden at this stage is "minimal" (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993))). If the plaintiff satisfies this initial burden, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Miceli, 830 F. App'x at 65 (quoting Treglia, 313 F.3d at 719). The defendant's burden "is not a particularly steep hurdle." Hyek v. Field Support Servs., Inc., 702 F. Supp. 2d 84, 93 (E.D.N.Y. 2010), aff'd, 461 F. App'x 59 (2d Cir. 2012). It "is one of production, not persuasion; it 'can involve no credibility assessment."' Reeves, 530 U.S. at 142 (quoting Hicks, 509 U.S. 509). If the defendant offers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for its action, the court must nevertheless deny summary judgment if the plaintiff can show that the explanation was pretext.

i. Failure to accommodate claim
Defendant argues that (1) "it is unclear from the record what accommodation Plaintiff alleges he sought, and when," (Def.'s Mem. 20); (2) Plaintiff was aware he could request assistance from Defendant's "Accommodations Department" but failed to formally contact the department or make the request, (id.); (3) Plaintiff has not "satisf[ied] his burden to show that [a reasonable] accommodation was available at [the] time," (id.); and (4) Defendant "provided Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation in the form of [FMLA] leave," (id. at 21), which "permitted [*59]  him to perform the essential functions of a flight attendant until sometime in September [of] 2017, when his condition deteriorated and he was no longer able to work" and he "was no longer covered under law," (id. at 22).
Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to accommodate his disability because it disciplined him for requesting FMLA leave and denied his request "for a different position with less travel so that [he] could be closer to his home base and near his doctors." (Pl.'s Sur-reply 1.) Plaintiff also argues that Defendant's rationale for denying his request to transfer — that "he was on probation . . . after receiving a Corrective Action Notice and Final Corrective Action Notice" — violates the ADA. (Id. at 2; see also Pl.'s Dep. 84:11-24.)
To establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate under the ADA, the plaintiff must show "(1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation;" and (4) "his employer refused to make a reasonable accommodation." Woolf v. Strada, 949 F.3d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 2020) (citing McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 126 (2d Cir. 2013)); see also Fox v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 918 F.3d 65, 73 (2d Cir. 2019) (same). Reasonable accommodation "may include [*60]  . . . modification of job duties and schedules, alteration of the facilities in which a job is performed, acquisition of devices to assist the performance of job duties, and, under certain circumstances, reassignment to a vacant position." Molina v. City of Rochester, 764 F. App'x 49, 51 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 97-98 (2d Cir. 2009)).
In a claim for failure to accommodate, "the plaintiff 'bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow [him] to perform the essential functions of [his] employment.'" McMillan, 711 F.3d at 126 (alterations in original) (quoting McBride, 583 F.3d at 96). "This burden is not heavy: 'It is enough for the plaintiff to suggest the existence of a plausible accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits.' Id. at 127 (quoting Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1995)). However, "[a]n ADA plaintiff does not satisfy [his] burden to identify a potential accommodation merely by reciting the formula that her employer could have reassigned [him]." McBride, 583 F.3d at 96 (citing Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000)). To shift the burden to the defendant, the plaintiff "must demonstrate the existence, at or around the time when accommodation was sought, of an existing vacant position to which [he] could have been reassigned." Id at 97-98.
The Court finds that while Plaintiff has established that he informally requested accommodation, [*61]  Plaintiff has not shown that there was a suitable vacancy and therefore has not satisfied his burden. Although Plaintiff did not formally request accommodation after broaching the subject with FSM Marsh, (see Pl.'s Dep. 92:1-10),23 the Second Circuit has held that "under certain circumstances, an employer is required to act proactively to accommodate the disability of an employee even if the employee does not request accommodation." McBride, 583 F3d at 102 (citing Brady v. Wal—Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir. 2008)); Brady, 531 F.3d at 135 ("We therefore hold that an employer has a duty reasonably to accommodate an employee's disability if the disability is obvious — which is to say, if the employer knew or reasonably should have known that the employee was disabled."). Defendant was on notice of Plaintiff's disability, (see, e.g., Def.'s 56.1 TT 21-22, 25; Pl.'s Dep. 92:1-10), and Plaintiff informally requested accommodation from his supervisor, FSM Marsh, triggering Defendant's obligation to "engage in 'an "interactive process" [with Plaintiff to] work together to assess whether [Plaintiff] can be reasonably accommodated.' Brady, 531 F.3d at 135 (quoting Jackan, 205 F.3d at 566).
However, although Defendant was aware of Plaintiff's disability and Plaintiff's informal request for accommodation through FSM Marsh is sufficient [*62]  for the purposes of the prima facie showing, Plaintiff's claim nevertheless fails because he does not allege that there was a suitable vacancy at the time he requested a transfer. See McBride, 583 F.3d at 101 ("The employer's failure to engage in [the required] interactive process, however, does not relieve a plaintiff of [his] burden of demonstrating, following discovery, that some accommodation of [his] disability was possible."); see also id at 97-98 ("ADA plaintiff does not satisfy [his] burden to identify a potential accommodation merely by reciting the formula that her employer could have reassigned [him]. Instead, [he] must demonstrate the existence, at or around the time when accommodation was sought, of an existing vacant position to which [he] could have been reassigned." (first citing Jackan, 205 F.3d at 566-67; and then citing Shannon v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 332 F.3d 95, 104 (2d Cir. 2003))); see also Hodges v. Holder, 518 F. App'x 45, 47 (2d Cir. 2013) (finding that Plaintiff's "mere speculation" that there was an existing vacant position did "raise a genuine issue as to whether there was a vacant position that [the plaintiff] was qualified for and to which he could have been assigned").
Plaintiff testified that he knew of a flight attendant who had been reassigned to "light duty" office work when she became unable to perform the essential functions [*63]  of the job, (see Pl.'s Dep. 91:7-17), and that other flight attendants sometimes performed light office duties, (id. 92:2-8), but there is no evidence in the record that such a job was available at the time Plaintiff discussed the possibility of a transfer with FSM Marsh. In addition, Plaintiff has not shown that had such a job been available, he would have been able to perform its essential functions, since during this time period he was experiencing "more flare-ups" related to his myelopathy, eventually precipitating his decision to take disability leave. (Pl.'s Dep. 70:19-71:13.)
For these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not established a prima facie case against Defendant for failing to provide reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim.
ii. Constructive discharge claim
Defendant argues that the Court should dismiss Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim because Plaintiff "cannot show that he was a qualified individual with a disability at the time he resigned in December 2017," and there is no evidence to suggest that Defendant "made Plaintiff's work environment intolerable [*64]  because [he] was disabled." (Def.'s Mem. 24-25.)
Plaintiff argues that "[i]n the summer of 2017, the invalid coachings and threat of termination for legitimate medical absences, were coupled with a number of other instances of harassment around the same time period, including being told his absences were a huge burden on the system and being humiliated during meetings." (Pl.'s Sur-reply 5-6 (citing Pl.'s Counter 56.1 II 19-51).) In addition, Plaintiff contends that during the July of 2017 verbal performance review, FSM Marsh threatened to terminate him if he received any future infractions. (Pl.'s Opp'n 9-10.)
The ADA prohibits an employer from discharging an employee because of his disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). A termination "may consist of either the employer's actual termination of the plaintiff's employment or the existence of intolerable conditions, attributable to the employer, amounting to a 'constructive' discharge." Green v. Town of East Haven, 952 F.3d 394, 404 (2d Cir. 2020). Constructive discharge claims require the employee to "show both (1) that there is evidence of the employer's intent to create an intolerable environment that forces the employee to resign, and (2) that . . . a reasonable person would have found the work conditions so intolerable [*65]  that he would have felt compelled to resign." Makinen v. City of New York, 722 F. App'x 50, 52 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Shultz v. Congregation Shearith Isr., 867 F.3d 298, 308 (2d Cir. 2017)); see also Green, 952 F.3d at 404 ("A plaintiff may prove constructive discharge by establishing that his employer, rather than acting directly, deliberately ma[de his] working conditions so intolerable that [he was] forced into an involuntary resignation, and such an intolerable condition may be shown by evidence that the employer gave the plaintiff the choice of resigning or being fired." (citation omitted) (quoting Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., 148 F.3d 149, 161 (2d Cir. 1998)); Adams v. Festival Fun Parks, LLC, 560 F. App'x 47, 49-50 (2d Cir. 2014) (stating that constructive discharge is a "high standard to establish" as an employee must "show both (1) that there is evidence of the employer's intent to create an 'intolerable' environment that forces the employee to resign, and (2) that the evidence shows that a reasonable person would have found the work conditions so intolerable that he 'would have felt compelled to resign' (citing Petrosino v. Bell Atl., 385 F.3d 210, 229 (2d Cir. 2004)); United States v. Bank of Am. Corp., No. 12-CV-8399, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44279, 2016 WL 1298985, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2016) ("A plaintiff can successfully plead the third element [of a retaliation claim under the False Claims Act] by showing that he was constructively discharged by his employer."). When alleging constructive discharge, plaintiffs "face a demanding standard." See Miller v. Praxair, Inc., 408 F. App'x 408, 410 (2d Cir. 2010) (stating that the standard for constructive discharge is a "demanding one").
In order [*66]  to establish a claim for constructive discharge, it is not enough for a plaintiff to fear termination. Massie v. Ikon Off Sols. Inc., 381 F. Supp. 2d 91, 96-100 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (holding that "fear of being terminated [was] not an adverse employment action because of its lack of consequence"). However, threats of termination may be sufficient to establish a constructive discharge claim. Grey v. City of Norwalk Bd of Educ., 304 F. Supp. 2d 314, 324 (D. Conn. 2004) (finding that "threats of termination alone are sometimes sufficient to show constructive discharge" (citing Lopez v. S.B. Thomas, Inc., 831 F.2d 1184, 1188 (2d Cir. 1987))); see also Chertkova v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 92 F.3d 81, 89-90 (2d Cir. 1996) ("In Lopez, we held that telling plaintiff he would be fired following probation, 'no matter what he did to improve his allegedly deficient performance,' was sufficient alone to support a finding of constructive discharge." (quoting Lopez, 831 F.2d at 1188)).
To determine whether threats of termination are sufficient to establish constructive discharge, courts look at factors such as whether the threats of termination were repeated, direct, or involved additional adverse conduct. See, e.g., Stull v. N. Shore-LIJ CareConnect Ins. Agency, Inc., No. 16-CV-2682, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113499, 2018 WL 3350319, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. July 9, 2018) ("[E]xcessive questioning, micro-management, and threats of termination are insufficient to support a claim of constructive discharge." (collecting cases)); Murray v. Town of North Hempstead, 853 F. Supp. 2d 247, 270 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (finding no constructive discharge where employee merely heard a rumor that supervisor wanted him terminated); Grey, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 324 (noting that a variety [*67]  of circumstances made the employee's situation "intolerable," including the repeated threat that her position would be eliminated, a rumored letter announcing her termination, petty reprimands, a suggestion that the District buy back her contract, and a subsequent comment that she should consider herself "finished"); Valdes v. NY.C. Dep't Env't Prot., No. 95-CV-10407, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16625, 1997 WL 666279, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 27, 1997) ("[The] [p]laintiff's allegation that his supervisors told him that 'it was best if [he] resigned' because he 'was going to be terminated' creates a triable issue of fact on the question of whether a constructive discharge occurred." (third alteration in original) (citation omitted)); Rupert v. City of Rochester, Dep 't of Env't Servs., 701 F. Supp. 2d 430, 440 (W.D.N.Y. 2010) ("A triable issue of fact as to constructive discharge may be demonstrated by proof that an employee was presented with the decision to resign or be fired." (citing Lopez, 831 F.2d at 1188-89)).
Plaintiff fails to establish a constructive discharge claim because the record does not contain any evidence of an abusive work environment that would compel a reasonable person to resign. Despite being approved through Sedgwick for intermittent FMLA leave starting November 1, 2015, Plaintiff failed to exercise his rights under the FMLA in order to cover any of his absences during the leave period. (2016 Kohn Letter (indicating [*68]  that Plaintiff had "used approximately [zero] days of [FMLA] leave for this claim").) The record indicates a similar pattern of conduct from November to December of 2016, the months preceding the Corrective Action Notice, and from January of 2016 to March of 2017, the months preceding the Final Corrective Action Notice. During these periods, Plaintiff was approved for intermittent FMLA leave but failed to follow Defendant's absence policy or take the necessary measures (other than on one occasion) to have his unexcused absences covered under the leave, triggering the adverse employment actions.24(See supra Sections I.b.iv—I.b.v.) Moreover, despite the issuance of the Corrective Action Notice just two months earlier, Director Gilmartin and FSM Suriano approved Plaintiff's request to transfer to DTW to facilitate his commute and subsequently allowed Plaintiff to transfer back to JFK at his request. (Def.'s 56.1 ¶¶ 63, 67 (citing Pl.'s Dep. 94:511).) Finally, despite Plaintiff being eligible for termination because he had a Final Corrective Action Notice on file issued on March 23, 2017, Defendant only gave Plaintiff an informal coaching on May 26, 2017, (Def.'s 56.1 ¶ 97), and on August [*69]  9, 2017, (id ¶ 100).25 Based on Defendant's policy specifying that a Final Corrective Action Notice "may result in review for termination for any infraction or failure to demonstrate adequate improvement" during the thirty-six-month period for which it remains on the employee's file, (Def.'s Performance Policy 3), FSM Marsh demonstrated leniency on May 26 by warning Plaintiff rather than terminating him. As discussed above, the August 9, 2017 verbal performance review and threat of termination regarding Plaintiff's July 6 absence, violated Defendant's Leave Policy and created an inference of retaliatory intent. (See supra Section II.c.ii.) However, this threat of termination, without more,26 is insufficient to establish constructive discharge. See Stull, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113499, 2018 WL 3350319, at *8. Under the circumstances of this case, no reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff's disciplinary history, which demonstrates leniency, amounts to the sort of abusive work environment that would make an employee feel compelled to resign. See Miller, 408 F. App'x at 410 (finding that "routine disagreements with supervisors or mild criticisms are simply insufficient to establish the sort of 'intolerable' working conditions necessary to a constructive discharge claim" (citing [*70]  Pena v. Brattleboro Retreat, 702 F.2d 322, 325-26 (2d Cir. 1983)); see also Clarke v. Pacifica Found., No. 07-CV-4605, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105468, 2011 WL 4356085, at *17 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, 2011) (finding that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence that she was constructively discharged because there was no evidence that her "employer 'intentionally create[d] a work atmosphere so intolerable that [the employee] [was] forced to quit involuntarily' (second alteration in original) (quoting Miller, 408 F. App'x at 409)).
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim.

iii. Retaliation
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA because Plaintiff did not suffer an adverse employment action, there is no evidence of retaliatory intent, and Plaintiff cannot establish that the legitimate reasons for the employment actions were pretextual. (Des Mem. 23.)
Plaintiff argues that even if Defendant escapes liability under the FMLA, it is unable to do so under the ADA because the ADA "is broader than the FMLA." (Pl.'s Opp'n 10.)
For the reasons discussed above with regard to Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim, the Court finds Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA. Plaintiff sought accommodation for his disability [*71]  in the form of FMLA leave, Defendant was aware of this activity, Plaintiff suffered adverse employment action on August 9, 2017, and this action gives rise to an inference of retaliatory intent against Plaintiff for exercising his rights under the ADA. (See supra Section II.C.ii.) Although "Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation," which "requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer," see Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013), Plaintiff may still establish causation by demonstrating temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action, see Zann Kwan, 737 F.3d at 845 ("[T]he but-for causation standard does not alter the plaintiff's ability to demonstrate causation at the prima facie stage on summary judgment or at trial indirectly through temporal proximity ")
The Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated but-for causation, as the August 9, 2017 verbal performance review occurred shortly after Sedgwick granted Plaintiff's request to cover the late-reported absence under his FMLA leave. Therefore, Plaintiff has established a prima facie case.
Although Defendant had a legitimate, [*72]  nondiscriminatory reason for its action,27 Plaintiff nevertheless raises a genuine issue of fact as to pretext because Defendant violated its own policy by penalizing Plaintiff for his July 6, 2017 absence in issuing the August 9, 2017 verbal coaching. The August 9, 2017 verbal coaching creates a triable issue of fact. A reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant's true motivation for the August 9 coaching was to retaliate against Plaintiff for seeking accommodation for his disability as Defendant was aware of the nature of Plaintiff's medical condition and that the absence was covered under his FMLA leave. (See Sedgwick Notes for Plaintiff's 2017 FMLA Leave 57.) Accordingly, the Court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim.

e. NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's unspecified claims for discrimination under the NYSHRL and NYCHRL fail because Plaintiff has not identified "an adverse employment action, [or] raise[d] an inference of animus, and [has] fail[ed] to rebut [Defendant's] legitimate business reasons" for the employment action. (Def.'s Mem. 23 n.15.)

i. NYSHRL
Defendant argues that "[t]o the extent Plaintiff's [*73]  NYSHRL discrimination claim is deemed also to be a retaliation claim, [it fails] for the same reasons," as Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim. (Id.)
Plaintiff does not directly respond to Defendant's arguments regarding his claims under the NYSHRL but argues that the same arguments in defense of his claims under the ADA apply to his claim under the NYSHRL.28(See Pl.'s Opp'n 10.)
Claims of disability-based discrimination and retaliation under the NYSHRL are analyzed under the same standard as claims of discrimination and retaliation under the ADA.29See Treglia, 313 F.3d at 719 ("[The NYSHRL] contain[s a] similar provision[] against retaliation and [is] governed in this respect by the same standards as the ADA." (citing Weissman v. Dawn Joy Fashions, Inc., 214 F.3d 224, 234 (2d Cir. 2000))); Hyek, 461 F. App'x at 60 ("Claims brought under the NYSHRL 'are analyzed identically' [to Title VII claims] and 'the outcome of an employment discrimination claim made pursuant to the NYSHRL is the same as it is under . . . Title VII.'" (quoting Smith v. Xerox Corp., 196 F.3d 358, 363 n.1 (2d Cir. 1999))); see also Rodal v. Anesthesia Grp. of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 117 n.1 (2d Cir. 2004) ("New York State disability discrimination claims are governed by the same legal standards as federal ADA claims."); Lovejoy-Wilson, 263 F.3d at 212 n.3 ("[T]he analysis under the state law parallels that used in the ADA context . . . ." (citing Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 332 n.1 (2d Cir. 2000))). Accordingly, the Court finds that for the same reasons [*74]  Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim survives summary judgment, but Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claims do not, Plaintiff's NYSHRL retaliation claim survives, while Plaintiff's NYSHRL discrimination claim does not.
The Court therefore grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's NYSHRL discrimination claims and denies Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

ii. NYCHRL
Defendant argues that "although the NYCHRL takes a broader view of what constitutes a qualifying disability, Plaintiff's NYCHRL claim fails for the same reasons — i.e., his failure to identify an adverse employment action, raise an inference of animus, and failure to rebut [Defendant's] legitimate business reasons." (Def.'s Mem. 23 n.15.)
Plaintiff argues that the "acts and practices of [Defendant] constitute unlawful discriminatory employment practices under the [NYCHRL]," and that as a result of these "acts Plaintiff has suffered and shall continue to suffer monetary damages and damages for mental suffering and humiliation."30 (TAC ¶¶ 100-101.)

1. Retaliation
Because the NYCHRL is "more liberal" than its federal and state counterparts, Makinen, 857 F.3d at 495 (quoting Loeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 278 (2d Cir. 2009)), the Court denies [*75]  Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's retaliation claims under the NYCHRL. See Zann Kwan, 737 F.3d at 843 n.3 ("[T]o the extent that the defendant has failed to show it is entitled to summary judgment [under Title VII], it would not be entitled to summary judgment under the more expansive standard of the NYCHRL.").

2. Discrimination
We "must analyze NYCHRL claims separately and independently from any federal and state law claims, construing its provisions broadly in favor of discrimination plaintiffs to the extent that such a construction is reasonably possible." Jones v. NY.C. Trans. Auth., 837 F. App'x 642, 644, 2021 WL 864694, at *2 n.1 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting Ya-Chen Chen v. City Univ. ofNY., 805 F.3d 59, 75 (2d Cir. 2015)). However, under the NYCHRL, a "plaintiff still bears the burden of showing that the conduct is caused by a discriminatory motive." Id; see also Ya-Chen Chen, 805 F.3d at 75 (stating that NYCHRL discrimination claims must be analyzed separately from federal and state discrimination claims but are evaluated using a "similar framework"). "[T]he plaintiff must establish a prima facie case, and the defendant then has the opportunity to offer legitimate reasons for its actions." Ya-Chen Chen, 805 F.3d at 75-76 (citing Bennett v. Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc., 92 A.D.3d 29, 936 N.Y.S.2d 112, 124 (App. Div. 2011)). If the defendant meets that burden, then "summary judgment is appropriate if 'the record establishes as a matter of law' that discrimination or retaliation 'play[ed] no role' in the defendant's [*76]  actions." Id at 76 (first quoting Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 110 n.8 (2d Cir. 2013); and then citing Williams v. N.Y.C. Hous. Auth., 61 A.D.3d 62, 872 N.Y.S.2d 27, 38, 40 n.27 (App. Div. 2009)). However, even under this more liberal standard, a plaintiff must "show that he 'has been treated less well at least in part "because of" either his [disability] or his age." Mathew v. N Shore-Long Island Jewish Health Sys., Inc., 582 F. App'x 70, 71 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110); see also White v. Andy Frain Servs., Inc., 629 F. App'x 131, 133 (2d Cir. 2015) ("[T]hough we must construe NYCHRL claims more liberally than federal and state law claims, NYCHRL similarly only prohibits discrimination in the 'terms, conditions or privileges of employment' when such discrimination is 'because of' a protected characteristic." (first quoting N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(1)(a); then citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1); and citing Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 109)).

A. Constructive Discharge
"New York courts have expressed the view . . . that the proper standard for constructive discharge claims under the amended NYCHRL has not been fully articulated." Tulino v. City of New York, 813 F. App'x 725, 727 n.2 (2d Cir. 2020) (citing Simmons-Grant v. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP, 116 A.D.3d 134, 981 N.Y.S.2d 89, 92 n.1 (App. Div. 2014)). However, the Second Circuit recently held that "any standard for constructive discharge . . . will require deliberate actions taken by the employer sufficient to cause a reasonable person to feel compelled to resign." Id at 727 (holding that plaintiffs "complain[t] that her work assignments were reduced" as a result of engaging in protected activity "is typically not considered enough to compel a reasonable person to resign" (citing Petrosino, 385 F.3d at 231); see also Short v. Deutsche Bank Sec., Inc., 79 A.D.3d 503, 913 N.Y.S.2d 64, 66 (App. Div. 2010) (holding [*77]  that to prevail on a claim of constructive discharge under the NYCHRL, the plaintiff must prove that the employer "deliberately created working conditions so intolerable, difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign" (quoting Mascola v. City Univ. of NY, 14 A.D.3d 409, 787 N.Y.S.2d 655, 656 (App. Div. 2005))). Even under the NYCHRL's more liberal standard, Plaintiffs allegations of isolated criticism from his supervisors coupled with FSM's Marsh's threat of termination if Plaintiff continued to violate Defendant's Leave Policy is insufficient to establish a claim of constructive discharge.
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claim of constructive discharge in violation of the NYCHRL.

B. Failure to accommodate
As stated above, the NYCHRL provides broader protections against disability discrimination than the NYSHRL, such that "the [NYCHRL] unquestionably forecloses summary judgment where the employer has not engaged in a good faith interactive process regarding a specifically requested accommodation." Jacobsen v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosps. Corp., 22 N.Y.3d 824, 837-38, 988 N.Y.S.2d 86, 11 N.E.3d 159 (2014) (first citing Phillips v. City of New York, 66 A.D.3d 170, 884 N.Y.S.2d 369, 373 (App. Div. 2009); and then citing Romanello v. Intesa Sanpaolo, S.p.A., 22 N.Y.3d 881, 884-85, 998 N.E.2d 1050, 976 N.Y.S.2d 426 (2013)). As discussed above, Plaintiff's informal request for accommodation from his supervisor, FSM Marsh, triggered Defendant's obligation to "engage [*78]  in 'an "interactive process"' with Plaintiff to "work together to assess whether [Plaintiff] can be reasonably accommodated." Brady, 531 F.3d at 135 (quoting Jackan, 205 F.3d at 566); Phillips, 884 N.Y.S.2d at 373 ("[W]hen confronted with a disabled employee's request for reasonable accommodation, the employer is required to engage in a good faith interactive process whereby employer and employee clarify the individual needs of the employee and the business, and identify the appropriate reasonable accommodation.").
By declining to engage Plaintiff in an interactive process when faced with Plaintiff's informal request for accommodation, (see Pl.'s Dep. 87:15-91:3), Defendant violated the NYCHRL, which requires employers to "engage in a cooperative dialogue . . . with a person who has requested an accommodation." N.Y.C. Admin. Code § § 8-102, 8-107(28)(a). See Hosking v. Mem'l Sloan-Kettering Cancer Ctr., 186 A.D.3d 58, 126 N.Y.S.3d 98, 103 (App. Div. 2020) ("It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer, labor organization or employment agency or an employee or agent thereof to refuse or otherwise fail to engage in a cooperative dialogue within a reasonable time with a person who has requested an accommodation or who the covered entity has notice may require such an accommodation." (quoting N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(28)(a))).
The Court, therefore, denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment with respect [*79]  to Plaintiff's NYCHRL failure to accommodate claim.

III. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Court grants Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's claim of (1) interference under the FMLA, (2) failure to accommodate and constructive discharge under the ADA, (3) discrimination in violation of the NYSHRL, and (4) constructive discharge in violation of the NYCHRL and dismisses these claims with prejudice. The Court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claims of retaliation under the FMLA, the ADA, the NYSHRL, and the NYCHRL and Plaintiff's claim of failure to accommodate under the NYCHRL.
