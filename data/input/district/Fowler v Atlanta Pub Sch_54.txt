Opinion



NON-FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
The above-styled case is presently before the Court on a motion [Doc. 8] to dismiss filed by Defendant Atlanta Public Schools ("APS") pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. Plaintiff Stephanie Fowler ("Fowler") filed her original Complaint [Doc. 1] in this case on July 13, 2018, and an Amended Complaint [Doc. 6] on October 2, 2018. In her Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts claims against Defendant alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), as amended by the ADA Amendments of 2008 ("ADAAA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq, retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehab Act"), 29 U.S.C. § 701, et seq., and violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 ("Title IX"), 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. [Doc. 6 - Plaintiff's Amended Complaint ("Am. Compl.")]. The matter has been fully briefed by the parties and is submitted to the undersigned for a report and recommendation to the District Judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B).

I. Factual Background
On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the complaint's factual allegations [*2]  are assumed true and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Hardy v. Regions Mortg., Inc., 449 F.3d 1357, 1359 (11th Cir. 2006); M.T.V. v. DeKalb Cty. School Dist., 446 F.3d 1153, 1156 (11th Cir. 2006). "However, conclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal." Oxford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis, 297 F.3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir. 2002) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the following factual allegations are drawn from the Amended Complaint and the relevant underlying documents.1
Plaintiff Fowler suffers from panic disorder, anxiety, and depression. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 20-21]. Fowler was employed by APS from August 1, 2011, through January 4, 2018, as a Special Education Teacher. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 16-17]. Plaintiff holds a Ph.D. in Education and Human Development and Masters Degrees of Education in Special Education, Educable Mental Retardation, and Elementary Education. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 18-19].
In August 2016, Plaintiff was assigned to L.O. Kimberly Elementary School ("LO"). [Am. Compl. ¶ 23]. Joseph Salley ("Salley") was Plaintiff's supervisor at LO. [Am. Compl. ¶ 22]. During Plaintiff's employment at LO, Salley harassed female employees, including Plaintiff, which resulted in complaints being filed against Salley. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 24, 26]. For instance, on July 28, 2017, Salley attempted to get [*3]  Plaintiff to wear a shirt that he provided and Plaintiff declined. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 27-28]. In response, Salley told another teacher to "knock the shit out of" Plaintiff. [Am. Compl. ¶ 29]. In addition, Salley reportedly told another female teacher that her "nipples [were] making [him] hard."2 [Am. Compl. ¶ 25].
Plaintiff reported Salley's July 28, 2017, comment to APS and was advised that Salley was "working on his communication skills." [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 30-31]. On September 26, 2017, Plaintiff received a poor evaluation from the Assistant Principal. [Am. Compl. ¶ 32; Charge 1185].
In October 2017, Plaintiff began seeing a psychologist and was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 33-34]. On October 19, 2017, Plaintiff provided APS with a doctor's note stating that Plaintiff had symptoms of anxiety and depression due to her work environment and recommending that Plaintiff be transferred to a different location.3 [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 35-37].
On or around October 20, 2017, Plaintiff advised Salley that she had never had any Principal speak to her in such a manner. [Am. Compl. ¶ 38]. Salley responded, "Oh, so you were a virgin and I was your first?" [Am. Compl. ¶ 39]. Plaintiff advised [*4]  APS of Salley's October 20, 2017, comments, and APS suggested that Plaintiff take FMLA leave. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 40-41]. APS also informed Plaintiff that Salley was placed on a Professional Development Plan. [Am. Compl. ¶ 42].
On October 23, 2017, Plaintiff requested a transfer as a reasonable accommodation.4 [Am. Compl. ¶ 43]. On October 24, 2017, Plaintiff's doctor signed off on her FMLA leave, and Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave was approved the same day. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 44-45]. The Amended Complaint does not attach as an exhibit a copy of Plaintiff's formal request for transfer and / or reasonable accommodation or any FMLA paperwork.
On October 27, 2017, Plaintiff filed a police report with the Fulton County Police Department against Salley alleging that Salley was sexually harassing her and threatening her.5 [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46-48]. Upon information and belief, APS knew that Plaintiff filed the police report against Salley. [Am. Compl. ¶ 49].

EEOC Charge 1185
On November 21, 2017, while she was on FMLA leave, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC checking the boxes indicating that the alleged discrimination complained of was based on "Race[,]" "Sex[,]" "Retaliation[,]" [*5]  and "Age[.]" [Charge 1185]. Plaintiff represented that the discrimination began as early as July 28, 2017, and continued through October 20, 2017, and that the discrimination was a "Continuing Action[.]" [Charge 1185]. Plaintiff's description of the particulars reads:
I was hired by the [APS] on August 10, 2011, as a Special Education Teacher. In August of 2016, I was assigned to L.O. Kimberly Elementary School with Joseph Salley as the Principal. On July 28, 2017, Mr. Salley told another teacher to, "knock the shit" out of me and then repeated it in my classroom. On September 26, 2017, Kristy Resse[sic], Assistant Principal, conducted an unannounced evaluation and meted out an unfavorable evaluation. Ms. Reese gave preferential treatment to a younger white co-worker and she received a higher evaluation. On October 20, 2017, I met with Mr. Salley to discuss my treatment. Mr. Salley told me, "Oh, so you were a virgin, and I was your first?" I have filed numerous complaints, but nothing has been done. On October 24, 2017, I was placed on a FMLA.
I believe I have been discriminated against because of my sex (female), race (African-American), and retaliated against for opposing unlawful [*6]  employment practices, in violation of Title VII . . . and because of my age (46), in violation of [the] Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 [ADEA], as amended.
[Charge 1185]. Plaintiff's Right to Sue Letter was issued on November 29, 2017, and advised that, based upon its investigation of Charge 1185, "the EEOC is unable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violations of the statutes." [Doc. 8-2 / Exhibit 2].
On November 30, 2017, while Plaintiff was on FMLA leave, Plaintiff's doctor diagnosed her with panic disorder and advised Plaintiff not to return to LO. [Am. Compl. ¶ 51]. During Plaintiff's FMLA leave period, she made several inquiries of APS about her transfer request and complained that her accommodation (i.e., transfer) had not been approved. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 52-53]. As of December 5, 2017, there was no decision on Plaintiff's request for transfer or requested accommodation. [Am. Compl. ¶ 54]. Plaintiff's FMLA leave was extended through January 16, 2018. [Am. Compl. ¶ 55]. As of January 4, 2018, when Plaintiff's request for transfer had still not been decided, Plaintiff resigned.6 [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 56, 61]. The Amended Complaint alleges that, "[b]ecause Plaintiff was not granted her accommodation, [*7]  Plaintiff was forced to resign her employment." [Am. Compl. ¶ 61]. Salley was never terminated by APS or otherwise removed from his position. [Am. Compl. ¶ 60].

EEOC Charge 4125
On April 6, 2018, Plaintiff filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC. [Charge 4125]. In Charge 4125, Plaintiff checked the boxes for "Disability" and "Retaliation" and noted that the alleged illegal actions took place from October 23, 2017, to January 4, 2018. Charge 4125 alleges:
I. I was hired by [APS] on August 10, 2011, as a Special Education Teacher. I am a person with a disability. On October 23, 2017, I met with Dr. Isis Manboard, Program Director, to request a transfer (Reasonable Accommodation) due to my disability. I was approved for FMLA beginning October 24, 2017. I filed a previous charge (410-2018-01185), for sexual harassment and hostile work environment by the Principal, Mr. Salley. While on FMLA, I contacted my employer on several occasions to find out about my request for transfer, but it had not been approved. Because my FMLA was due to run out soon, my medical provider stated that I should not return to work. On January 4, 2018, based on the medical provider's recommendation, I [*8]  resigned (Constructive Discharge).
II. I believe I have been discriminated against because of my disability, and retaliated against for opposing unlawful employment practices in violation of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended.
[Charge 4125]. Plaintiff did not allege continuing action. [Charge 4125]. On April 12, 2018, the EEOC sent Plaintiff a Right to Sue Letter. [Doc. 9, Exhibit B].
On July 13, 2018, Plaintiff commenced this lawsuit with the filing of her Complaint. [Doc. 1]. Plaintiff amended her Complaint as a matter of course on October 2, 2018. [Docs. 6-7]. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint asserts the following causes of action: Count I - Failure to Accommodate under the ADA; Count II - Disability Discrimination under the ADA (i.e., constructive discharge); Count III - Retaliation under the ADA; Count IV - Retaliation under Title VII; Count V - Failure to Accommodate under the Rehab Act; and Count VI - Hostile Work Environment / Sexual Harassment Based Upon Gender under Title IX. [Doc. 6]. Defendant moves for dismissal of all claims. [Docs. 8, 8-1].
Additional facts will be set forth as necessary during discussion of the parties' legal arguments.

II. Standard of Review
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [*9]  include no requirement that a plaintiff detail the facts upon which the plaintiff bases a claim. Rule 8(a)(2) requires a complaint to contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) (as amended 2007).
"While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, . . . a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of [her] 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do[.]" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1964-65 (2007) (citations omitted); accord Financial Sec. Assurance, Inc. v. Stephens, Inc., 500 F.3d 1276, 1282-83 (11th Cir. 2007) (recognizing that "while notice pleading may not require that the pleader allege a specific fact to cover every element or allege with precision each element of a claim, it is still necessary that a complaint contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). "Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level," i.e., they must do more than merely create a "'suspicion [of] a legally cognizable right of action,' on the assumption [*10]  that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)." Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965 (citations omitted) (emphasis omitted). "Stated differently, the factual allegations in a complaint must 'possess enough heft' to set forth 'a plausible entitlement to relief[.]'" Stephens, 500 F.3d at 1282 (quoting Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1966-67). A plaintiff's complaint will be dismissed if it does not contain "factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (citation omitted). "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id. In short, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion "is granted only when the movant demonstrates that the complaint has failed to include 'enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Dusek v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 832 F.3d 1243, 1246 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1974).
The court's inquiry at this stage of the proceedings focuses on whether the challenged pleadings "give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 2200 (2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). And, a court reviewing a motion to dismiss must keep in mind that a "motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted merely [*11]  tests the sufficiency of the complaint; it does not decide the merits of the case." Wein v. American Huts, Inc., 313 F. Supp. 2d 1356, 1359 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (citing Milburn v. United States, 734 F.2d 762, 765 (11th Cir. 1984)). "Regardless of the alleged facts, however, a court may dismiss a complaint on a dispositive issue of law." Bernard v. Calejo, 17 F. Supp. 2d 1311, 1314 (S.D. Fla. 1998) (citing Marshall Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Marshall Cty. Gas Dist., 992 F.2d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir. 1993) ("[T]he court may dismiss a complaint . . . when, on the basis of a dispositive issue of law, no construction of the factual allegations will support the cause of action.")); see also Glover v. Liggett Group, Inc., 459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir. 2006) (same); Aque v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 629 F. Supp. 2d 1336, 1350 (N.D. Ga. 2009).
The Court will apply these standards in ruling on Defendant's motion [Doc. 8] to dismiss.

III. Discussion
Defendant contends that: 1) Plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim is barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and is untimely [Doc. 8-1 at 5-9]; 2) Plaintiff's ADA claims fail on multiple grounds, including (a) failure of Plaintiff to allege sufficient facts in support of disability [Doc. 8-1 at 10-12] and (b) because Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts in support of any materially adverse action / or in support of her claim that she was constructively discharged [Doc. 8-1 at 12-14]; and 3) Title VII is Plaintiff's exclusive remedy for employment discrimination claims, and, even if Plaintiff was capable of maintaining a Title IX claim, she has not alleged sufficient [*12]  facts to show that the Defendant subjected her to the severe and pervasive conduct required to state a claim for hostile work environment [Doc. 8-1 at 14-17; Doc. 10].

A. Administrative Exhaustion / Count IV - Title VII Retaliation
Defendant first contends that Plaintiff failed to administratively exhaust her Title VII retaliation claim (depriving the Court of subject matter jurisdiction) and that the claim is untimely.7 [Doc. 8-1 at 5-9; Doc. 10 at 2-5].
Both Title VII and the ADA require Plaintiff to exhaust her administrative remedies.8 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e) (Title VII); 42 U.S.C. §§ 12117 (ADA); Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 Fed. Appx. 924, 926 (11th Cir. 2010) ("Before filing suit under Title VII, . . . a plaintiff must exhaust the available administrative remedies by filing a charge with the EEOC.") (citation omitted); and see Maynard v. Pneumatic Products Corp., 256 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir. 2001) (ADA requires exhaustion) (citations omitted); see also Latson v. Holder, 82 F. Supp. 3d 377, 385-86 (D. D.C. March 9, 2015) ("As with other forms of alleged discrimination, plaintiffs must first exhaust their administrative remedies under Title VII . . . by raising these claims in an administrative complaint.") (citations omitted). It is well established in the Eleventh Circuit that a "'plaintiff's judicial complaint is limited by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out [*13]  of the charge of discrimination.'" Gregory v. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources, 355 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted); accord Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 465-66 (5th Cir. 1970) (deciding as a matter of first impression the standard to be utilized in measuring the proper scope of an EEOC complaint).9 "Claims omitted from the EEOC charge may still be litigated when 'reasonably related' to those claims brought in the EEOC charge." Waldemar v. American Cancer Soc., 971 F. Supp. 547, 553 (N.D. Ga. 1996) (citing Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 466). "If not reasonably related, the court is precluded from considering claims not raised in the EEOC complaint." Id. (citation omitted). The reason for this rule is that under the statutory scheme of Title VII, the EEOC is given the first opportunity to investigate the alleged discrimination and attempt to achieve voluntary compliance. See Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 466. Thus, raising a claim at the administrative level is a condition precedent to filing a Title VII action asserting a given claim. Giles v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 542 Fed. Appx. 756, 758 (11th Cir. 2013) ("as a condition precedent to filing a law suit an individual must exhaust [her] administrative remedies by filing a charge of unlawful discrimination with the EEOC"); accord Mulhall v. Advance Security, Inc., 19 F.3d 586, 589 n.8 (11th Cir. 1994); but see Peppers v. Cobb Cty., Georgia, 835 F.3d 1289, 1296-97 (11th Cir. 2016) (observing that certain Eleventh Circuit cases have treated the administrative exhaustion requirement as a "'jurisdictional prerequisite to filing a Title VII action'") (quoting Crawford v. Babbitt, 186 F.3d 1322, 1326 (11th Cir. 1999)).10 Accordingly, "[t]he starting point [*14]  of ascertaining the permissible scope of a judicial complaint is the administrative charge and investigation." Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1522 (11th Cir. 1985). In Wu v. Thomas, 863 F.2d 1543 (11th Cir. 1989), the Eleventh Circuit explained as follows:
As long as allegations in the judicial complaint and proof are reasonably related to charges in the administrative filing and no material differences between them exist, the court will entertain them. . . . Judicial claims which serve to amplify, clarify, or more clearly focus earlier EEO complaints are appropriate. Allegations of new acts of discrimination, offered as the essential basis for the requested judicial review are not appropriate.
Id. at 1547 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
Moreover, in determining whether a claim has been exhausted, the scope of Plaintiff's EEOC Charge is not to be strictly construed. See Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 465 (explaining that "procedural technicalities are not to stand in the way of Title VII complainants . . . [and that n]othing in the Act commands or even condones the application of archaic pleading concepts") (citations omitted); accord Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280 (quoting Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 465). Rather, as a rule, courts have been "reluctant to allow procedural technicalities to bar claims" and instead have resolved "procedural ambiguities [*15]  in the statutory framework . . . with virtual unanimity . . . in favor of the complaining party." Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 460-61 (discussing "the remedial and humanitarian underpinnings of Title VII"). With these principles in mind, the Court turns to the allegations within Plaintiff's Amended Complaint and the parties' respective exhaustion arguments.
In her Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that APS retaliated against her in violation of Title VII and that her claim is supported by protected expression, namely, her complaints about Salley's treatment of her and other women, her objections to Salley's conduct as well as Plaintiff's filing of a police report against Salley, and Charge 1185. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 87-90]. Plaintiff alleges that her complaints about Salley were met with adverse actions, including being subjected to a hostile work environment, being given a negative performance review, and finally, constructive discharge.11 [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 92-94].
As stated earlier, "'plaintiff's judicial complaint is limited by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.'" Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280 (citation omitted).12 In this case, there are two different charges of discrimination [*16]  to evaluate. As previously recited, Charge 1185 reads in part:
I was hired by the [APS] on August 10, 2011, as a Special Education Teacher. In August of 2016, I was assigned to L.O. Kimberly Elementary School with Joseph Salley as the Principal. On July 28, 2017, Mr. Salley told another teacher to, "knock the shit" out of me and then repeated it in my classroom. On September 26, 2017, Kristy Resse[sic], Assistant Principal, conducted an unannounced evaluation and meted out an unfavorable evaluation. Ms. Reese gave preferential treatment to a younger white co-worker and she received a higher evaluation. On October 20, 2017, I met with Mr. Salley to discuss my treatment. Mr. Salley told me, "Oh, so you were a virgin, and I was your first?" I have filed numerous complaints, but nothing has been done. On October 24, 2017, I was placed on a FMLA.
I believe I have been discriminated against because of my sex (female), race (African-American), and retaliated against for opposing unlawful employment practices, in violation of Title VII . . . and because of my age (46), in violation of [the ADEA], as amended.
[Charge 1185 (emphasis added)]. The EEOC completed its investigation and issued the Right [*17]  to Sue on November 29, 2017. [Doc. 8-1, Exhibit 2].
As an initial matter, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim - admittedly premised upon the allegations within Charge 1185 - is untimely. [Doc. 8-1 at 7-8]. With respect to timeliness, Defendant correctly argues that any Title VII retaliation claim Plaintiff wished to pursue based on claims in Charge 1185 would have had to be filed on or before February 27, 2018, or ninety (90) days after the date of the Right to Sue Letter for Charge 1185 (November 29, 2017). [Doc. 8-1 at 7-8]. Plaintiff's lawsuit was filed July 13, 2018, approximately five months later.13 Simply put, Plaintiff cannot rely on the existence of Charge 1185, or the factual allegations within Charge 1185, to support her Title VII retaliation claim as Plaintiff is "barred from asserting [any claims] based upon the acts asserted in this charge." Spears v. Missouri Dep't of Corrections and Human Resources, 210 F.3d 850, 853 (8th Cir. 2000); accord Cannady v. Automatic Data Processing, Inc., 2006 WL 3422424, at *10 (N.D. Ga. November 28, 2006) (applying Spears); Labady v. Gemini Air Cargo, Inc., 350 F. Supp. 2d 1002, 1010 (S.D. Ga. 2004) ("Plaintiff may not circumvent the timeliness requirements of Title VII by alleging the time-barred acts of discrimination are at issue in his timely filed retaliation claim. The law is clearly established that discrete, time-barred discriminatory actions are not actionable, [*18]  regardless of how they may relate to actions that were filed in a timely fashion."). For this reason, the Court finds that Plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim is subject to dismissal as a matter of law for being untimely.
Likewise, Defendant correctly argues that mention of Charge 1185 within Charge 4125 does not "revive" the Title VII claims or theories. [Doc. 8-1 at 6]. Approximately four months after receiving her Right To Sue on Charge 1185, Plaintiff alleged in Charge 4125:
I. I was hired by [APS] on August 10, 2011, as a Special Education Teacher. I am a person with a disability. On October 23, 2017, I met with Dr. Isis Manboard, Program Director, to request a transfer (Reasonable Accommodation) due to my disability. I was approved for FMLA beginning October 24, 2017. I filed a previous charge (410-2018-01185), for sexual harassment and hostile work environment by the Principal, Mr. Salley. While on FMLA, I contacted my employer on several occasions to find out about my request for transfer, but it had not been approved. Because my FMLA was due to run out soon, my medical provider stated that I should not return to work. On January 4, 2018, based on the medical provider's recommendation, [*19]  I resigned (Constructive Discharge).
II. I believe I have been discriminated against because of my disability, and retaliated against for opposing unlawful employment practices in violation of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended.
[Charge 4125 (emphases added)]. According to Plaintiff, Charge 4125, her second EEOC Charge, asserts retaliation under both Title VII and the ADA because it "discusses her claims of sexual harassment and hostile work environment against Mr. Salley and Defendant[,]" such that "Title VII retaliation is clearly within the scope of [Charge 4125]. . . ."14 [Doc. 9 at 10].
As detailed herein, Charges 1185 and 4125 contain distinct legal theories and dates for the alleged discrimination. With the exception of Plaintiff's one-sentence reference to her previous EEOC Charge (hardly a discussion as argued in her brief), the two charges allege wholly different types of discrimination based upon different protected classes. Although both EEOC Charges allege a form of retaliation, Charge 1185 is premised upon Title VII and the ADEA (and does not allege disability or disability discrimination) while Charge 4125 is premised solely on the ADA with no mention of Title VII or the ADEA. [Charge [*20]  1185, Charge 4125]. Significantly, Charge 4125, filed April 6, 2018, provided Plaintiff, who was and is represented by counsel, an opportunity to describe the particulars of her charge of discrimination.15 [Charge 4125]. At the time Plaintiff filed Charge 4125, she had already tendered her resignation to APS and was already asserting constructive discharge. [Charge 4125]. And the facts in support of alleged constructive discharge are premised on disability as opposed to Title VII protected characteristics. For instance, Plaintiff explained that, "based on the medical provider's recommendation, I resigned (Constructive Discharge)." [Charge 4125]. Charge 4125 plainly refers to retaliation under the ADA only - with no mention of Title VII. [Doc. 10 at 5]. Given these material differences, it is not reasonable to conclude that Plaintiff's Title VII allegations within the Amended Complaint are "like or related to, or grew out of" an investigation of the factual allegations in Charge 4125. See Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280; Wu, 863 F.2d at 1547; see e.g., Thomas v. Miami Dade Pub. Health Tr., 369 Fed. Appx. 19, 22 (11th Cir. 2010) (although retaliation was generally mentioned in charge of discrimination, it did not assert specific facts of retaliation later alleged in judicial complaint). Rather, by the time Plaintiff [*21]  filed Charge 4125, her legal theory shifted to disability discrimination and retaliation because of her disability.16 [Charge 4125]. In short, Charge 4125 presents entirely new allegations of discrimination and retaliation and, on its face, limits Plaintiff's claims to the ADA. See Wu, 863 F.2d at 1547.
For these reasons, the Court RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Title VII claim alleging retaliation (Count IV) be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

B. Plaintiff's ADA17 & Rehab Act Claims
"In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Congress intended that the Act 'provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities' and provide broad coverage[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(1)(2008). The ADA was "designed [in part] to . . . enable . . . persons [with disabilities] 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (quoting Harding v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F. Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and [*22]  privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001).
"The Rehabilitation Act . . . prohibits federal agencies [or state and local agencies receiving federal funding] from discriminating in employment against otherwise qualified individuals with a disability." Sutton v. Lader, 185 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir. 1999) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 791). The Rehabilitation Act expressly incorporates the standards of the ADA.18 See 29 U.S.C. § 794(d). Accordingly, the prima facie elements are the same for disability discrimination claims under both statutory schemes. Sutton, 185 F.3d at 1207 (citation omitted); and see, e.g., Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assocs., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910, 915 (11th Cir. 1996) (ADA case relying on Rehab Act regulations to determine liability).

1. Alleged Discrimination Based Upon Plaintiff's Disability
"Subchapter I of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination on account of disability in employment, covers the same employers and provides the same remedies contained in Title VII. . . ." Albra v. Advan, Inc., 490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117). As a result, "[t]he ADA adopts in large part the Title VII case precedent[,]" and "courts have used the Title VII cases as a guide for determining employer liability under the ADA." Huck v. Mega Nursing Services, Inc., 989 F. Supp. 1462, 1463 (S.D. Fla. 1997); and see Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2007) (in summary judgment context, "[t]he burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims is applicable to ADA claims") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Durley v. APAC, Inc., 236 F.3d 651, 657 (11th Cir. 2000) (applying analytical framework [*23]  prescribed in McDonnell Douglas19 and Title VII cases in the context of ADA disability discrimination case) (citation omitted).
To establish a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she has a disability as defined in the ADA; (2) she is a "qualified individual," meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, she can perform the essential functions of the job she holds; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007). The ADA's definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of an individual with a disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
"To state [an ADA disability] discrimination claim, a complaint need only provide enough factual matter to 'plausibly suggest' that the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action due to intentional discrimination." Davis v. Johnson, 2016 WL 3360568, at *3 (N.D. Ga. April 22, 2016) (quoting Surtain v. Hamlin Terrace Foundation, 789 F.3d 1239, 1246 (11th Cir. 2015)), report and recommendation adopted by 2016 WL 3349343 (N.D. Ga. June 15, 2016). The Eleventh Circuit clarified in Surtain that the that Iqbal-Twombly pleading standard governs the motion to dismiss analysis - not the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting evidentiary framework. See Surtain, 789 F.3d at 1245-46 (holding that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework is not the governing standard [*24]  in deciding motion for default, which requires the court to find a sufficient basis in the pleadings for the judgment entered and is akin to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim).

a. Disability
The first prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that she has a disability as it is defined under the ADA. The ADA defines the term "disability" as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment . . . ."20 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C) (2009).
The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff is entitled to protection under the ADA due to mental impairments, including panic disorder, anxiety, and depression. [Am. Compl. ¶ 21]. In Paragraph 21, Plaintiff expressly alleges that she "suffers from the disabilities of panic disorder, anxiety, and depression." [Am. Compl. ¶ 21 (emphasis added)]. In addition, Plaintiff alleges that, when APS was advised by Plaintiff's doctor that she was experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression, Defendant suggested that Plaintiff take FMLA leave. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 21, 35-36, 41].
Plaintiff claims to proceed under the "regarded as" disabled [*25]  prong, 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(C), and argues that she has sufficiently pleaded that Defendant APS regarded her as disabled when APS suggested that Plaintiff apply for FMLA leave after learning that Plaintiff had been diagnosed with anxiety disorder.21 [Doc. 9 at 13-14 (citing Am. Compl. ¶¶ 35, 36, 41, 44-45)]. "An individual meets the requirement of 'being regarded as having such an impairment' if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." 42 U.S.C.A. § 12102(3)(A). An individual, however, will not be able to meet the requirement of being "regarded as" disabled if her impairment is "transitory and minor."22 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(B). Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(l), an individual is regarded as impaired if such individual:
(1) Has a . . . mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation;
(2) Has a . . . mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or
(3) Has none of the impairments defined in paragraph (h)(1) or [*26]  (2) of this section but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(l). Thus, a plaintiff may establish that she is disabled simply by showing that defendant "perceived [her] to have a . . . mental impairment, 'whether or not the impairment . . . is perceived to limit a major life activity.'" Adkison v. Willis, 214 F. Supp. 3d 1190, 1196-97 (N.D. Ala. 2016) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A)); and see Dulaney v. Miami-Dade Cty., 481 Fed. Appx. 486, 489 n.3 (11th Cir. 2012) ("In 2008, . . . Congress changed the definition of 'disability' such that being 'regarded as' having a disability no longer requires a showing that the employer perceived the individual to be substantially limited in a major life activity."). In support, Plaintiff cites Pritchard v. Southern Co. Services, 92 F.3d 1130 (11th Cir. 1996), for the proposition that an employer's placement of the plaintiff-employee on disability leave was evidence (albeit not determinative) that the plaintiff had a record of being impaired and that the employer regarded her as being impaired. Id. at 1132-34 (in a summary judgment posture, recognizing plaintiff's depression as a mental impairment, and considering disability under both §§ 12102(1)(A) and (1)(C) and finding genuine issues of material fact as to both types of disability; finding that the placement of plaintiff on paid and unpaid disability leave sufficient to preclude summary judgment on "regarded as" [*27]  disabled issue), amended on rehearing in part, 102 F.3d 1118 (11th Cir. 1996). In response, Defendant posits that a qualifying FMLA condition does not establish a disability under the ADA and that "[t]here is nothing to suggest that Defendant's approval of Plaintiff's FMLA leave correlates to Defendant regarding Plaintiff as disabled." [Doc. 10 at 8]. Viewing the facts as alleged in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, on October 19, 2017, Plaintiff provided APS with a doctor's note stating that Plaintiff had symptoms of anxiety and depression due to her work environment and recommending that Plaintiff be transferred to a different location. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 35-37]. "The mere fact that an employer is aware of an employee's impairment is insufficient to demonstrate that the employer regarded the employee as disabled." Sutton, 185 F.3d at 1209 (Rehab Act case); accord Kelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d 102, 109 (3rd Cir. 1996). However, given APS's response to Plaintiff's doctor's note - suggesting that Plaintiff take FMLA leave - an inference could be drawn that APS perceived or regarded Plaintiff as disabled whether factually correct or not.23 [Am. Compl. ¶ 41 ("Defendant suggested that Plaintiff take FMLA leave.")]. The Court finds that such an inference is supported by the facts as alleged notwithstanding [*28]  the distinctions between the FMLA and ADA statutory schemes.
The Court finds that Plaintiff plausibly alleges that she is an individual with a disability under 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(C).

b. Qualified Individual
The second prima facie element, that Plaintiff be a "qualified individual[,]" is conceded. The ADA defines the term "qualified individual" as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. . . .
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Defendant does not challenge that Plaintiff's factual allegations are sufficient to support the "qualified individual" requirement. [Doc. 8-1 at 10; Doc. 9 at 12 ("Defendant makes no challenge to Plaintiff's ability to perform the essential functions of her employment position . . . [and its] sole challenge to Plaintiff as a 'qualified individual' is that Plaintiff allegedly suffers from no 'disability' as contemplated by the ADA."].

c. Disability Discrimination
The final element necessary to establish a prima facie case under the ADA requires Plaintiff to show that she was discriminated [*29]  against because of her disability. See Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268 (emphases provided); and see Mattingly v. Univ. of South Florida Bd. of Trustees, 931 F. Supp. 2d 1176, 1181-82 (M.D. Fla. 2013). "Under the ADA, there are two distinct categories of disability discrimination: (1) disparate treatment and (2) failure to accommodate." Toliver v. City of Jacksonville, 2017 WL 1196637, at *5 (M.D. Fla. March 31, 2017) (citing Holly, 492 F. 3d at 1261-62); see also Mattingly, 931 F. Supp. 2d at 1182 (plaintiff may satisfy third prima facie element by alleging facts showing intentional discrimination, disparate treatment, or failure to make reasonable accommodations) (citing Rylee v. Chapman, 316 Fed. Appx. 901, 906 (11th Cir. 2009)); and see 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) (failure to make reasonable accommodations included within ADA's definition of discrimination).
Plaintiff's Amended Complaint seeks to assert both types of disability discrimination. Even so, Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims are premised on her allegation that by not accommodating her, APS forced her to resign. As noted, Defendant seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's ADA claims (including retaliation) based on inability to allege adverse employment action.24

i. Counts I, V - Failure To Provide Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant APS failed to provide reasonable accommodation in violation of both the ADA and the Rehab Act. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 65-71, 97-103]. Because the ADA and Rehab Act rely on the same law, supra, Plaintiff's failure to accommodate [*30]  claims are discussed together.
As discussed supra, disability discrimination under the ADA encompasses an employer's failure to make reasonable accommodations for the limitations of an individual with a disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "Thus, an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and unless the employer can show undue hardship."25 Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262 (emphasis in original); and see McKane v. UBS Financial Services, Inc., 363 Fed. Appx. 679, 681 (11th Cir. 2010) (recognizing an employer's failure to provide reasonable accommodation as the third prima facie element in ADA failure to accommodate claim and one way a plaintiff can show disability discrimination) (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1259-60; and see Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 (citation omitted). Whether an accommodation is reasonable depends upon the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285.
Here, Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim is based on her allegation that she requested and was denied a transfer to a different location (different school within APS).26 [Doc. 9 at 13-14; Doc. 10 at 9]. Although the Court finds [*31]  that Plaintiff has adequately pled facts in support of the threshold question of disability, as previously discussed, Plaintiff does not argue in her memorandum of law that she has an actual disability or a record of disability but instead contends that she meets the definition of disability under the ADA because she was "regarded as" disabled, 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(C). [Doc. 9 at 13-14]. The relevant regulations provide that an employer "is not required to provide a reasonable accommodation to an individual who meets the definition of disability solely under the 'regarded as' prong." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(e). Because the Court has already determined that § 12102(1)(C) is Plaintiff's sole basis for alleging disability under the ADA, the Court finds that Defendant was not required to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation. See id.; and see Smart v. DeKalb Cty., Georgia, 2018 WL 1089677, at *11 n.9 (N.D. Ga. February 26, 2018) (citations omitted); Cooney v. Barry School of Law, 2016 WL 7130941, at *6 (M.D. Fla. March 9, 2016) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(e)). As a result, Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim is due to be dismissed.
The undersigned RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion be GRANTED with respect to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims alleging failure to accommodate (Counts I, V) and that these claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

ii. Count II - Disability Discrimination / Constructive [*32]  Discharge
In Count II, Plaintiff identifies her claim as "ADA Discrimination" and appears to allege disability discrimination based upon a disparate treatment theory. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 75-78 (referencing adverse action, similarly situated disabled employees, and inference of discrimination)]. In order to plead a prima facie case of disability discrimination based upon disparate treatment, Plaintiff must allege facts that plausibly show: 1) Plaintiff was a member of a protected class (i.e., disability); 2) Plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action; and 3) Plaintiff's employer treated similarly situated employees outside the protected class differently or more favorably.27 See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1087, 1091 (11th Cir. 2004) (Title VII action before the court on motion for summary judgment); accord Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir. 2008) (same); and see Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997).
The gist of Count II is that Defendant APS failed to provide Plaintiff with reasonable accommodations and forced Plaintiff to resign. Plaintiff's allegations in support of this claim include no new factual allegations, and the only alleged adverse employment action is constructive discharge.28 [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 56-61, 75 (constructive discharge)]. Indeed, the Amended Complaint alleges, "Plaintiff suffered the adverse [*33]  action of constructive discharge when her accommodation request was denied." [Am. Compl. ¶ 75]. Plaintiff alleges that "the timing of Plaintiff's condition and Defendant's failure to provide reasonable accommodations give rise to an inference of discrimination." [Am. Compl. ¶ 78 (emphasis added)]. Plaintiff fails to allege any other facts in support of the intentional discrimination element of a disparate treatment claim and the Amended Complaint acknowledges as much. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 76-77 (plaintiff unaware of similarly situated employees being discharged under similar circumstances and unaware of similarly situated disabled employees working for Defendant during relevant time period)]. And see Floyd v. Lee, 968 F. Supp. 2d 308, 330 (D. D.C. 2013) (citations omitted) (explaining why reasonable accommodation claims under ADA do not require proof of discriminatory intent and how constructive discharge claim may arise where "an employer deliberately denies an accommodation knowing that the denial will make working conditions so intolerable that the disabled employee will be forced to resign"). Accordingly, the Court analyzes this cause of action as a claim for constructive discharge.
"To prove constructive discharge, [*34]  the employee must demonstrate that [her] working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in [her] position would be compelled to resign." Kilgore v. Thompson & Brock Mgmt., Inc., 93 F.3d 752, 754 (11th Cir. 1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Wardwell v. School Bd., 786 F.2d 1554, 1557 (11th Cir. 1986). "Moreover, an employer must have been given sufficient time to remedy the situation for an employee to successfully assert that [she] was constructively discharged." Hernandez v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 977 F. Supp. 1160, 1166 (M.D. Fla. 1997) (citing Kilgore, 93 F.3d at 754). A finding of constructive discharge is appropriate only where a reasonable person would have found the conditions of employment intolerable. See Hill v. Winn-Dixie Stores, 934 F.2d 1518, 1527 (11th Cir. 1991); and see Perry v. Harris Chernin, Inc., 126 F.3d 1010, 1015 (7th Cir. 1997).
[C]onstructive discharge . . . can be regarded as an aggravated case of . . . hostile work environment. For an atmosphere of . . . hostility to be actionable, . . . the offending behavior "must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." . . . A hostile-environment constructive discharge claim entails something more: A plaintiff who advances such a compound claim must show working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign.
Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 124 S. Ct. 2342, 2354 (2004) (quoting Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2405 (1986) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); see also Hipp v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 252 F.3d 1208, 1231 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). "In [*35]  evaluating constructive discharge claims, . . . . [the Court] employ[s] an objective standard." Hipp, 252 F.3d at 1231 (citing DeKalb Cty. School Dist., 145 F.3d at 1450) ("we do not consider the plaintiff's subjective feelings"); and see Hellums v. Webster Indus., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d 1287, 1296-97 (M.D. Ala. 1998) ("In assessing constructive discharge claims, [courts] do not consider a plaintiff's subjective feelings about [her] employer's actions. Rather, [courts] determine whether a reasonable person in [the plaintiff's] position would be compelled to resign.") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
"Establishing a constructive discharge claim is a more onerous task than establishing a hostile work environment claim." Bryant v. Jones, 575 F.3d 1281, 1298 (11th Cir. 2009); accord Suders, 124 S. Ct. at 2354. With respect to constructive discharge, Plaintiff specifically alleges that:
• On November 30, 2017, Plaintiff's doctor diagnosed her with panic disorder and advised that she not return to LO.
• Plaintiff contacted APS several times regarding her transfer request and complained that her accommodation had not yet been approved.
• As of December 5, 2017, Plaintiff's transfer request was not approved.
• Plaintiff's FMLA leave was extended to January 16, 2018.
• As of January 4, 2018, Plaintiff's transfer request was not approved.
• Mr. Salley was never terminated or otherwise removed from his [*36]  position at LO.
• Because Plaintiff was not granted her accommodation, Plaintiff was forced to resign her employment.
[Am. Compl. ¶¶ 51-61].
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot plausibly allege that she was constructively discharged from employment where she never returned to the work environment at the conclusion of her FMLA leave period and voluntarily resigned. [Doc. 8-1 at 13; Doc. 10 at 9]. In essence, Defendant's position is that Plaintiff's remedy was to remain on the job (or return) and pursue relief through the appropriate channels. See Perry, 126 F.3d at 1015 ("[U]nless conditions are beyond 'ordinary' discrimination, a complaining employee is expected to remain on the job while seeking redress."); and see Adkison, 214 F. Supp. 3d at 1199 (finding summary judgment record contained no evidence plaintiff was forced to resign where plaintiff was on leave for evaluation of impairment and sheriff remained in contact with employee throughout leave during which time employer paid for evaluations and where plaintiff obtained other employment before sheriff received fitness-for-duty certification permitting plaintiff's return to work). Arguably, by resigning two weeks before her FMLA leave period was set to expire and not returning to [*37]  work, Plaintiff did not give Defendant the opportunity to explore reasonable accommodations (or to definitively deny Plaintiff's request for accommodation). See Kilgore, 93 F.3d at 754 (affirming grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant on constructive discharge claim where plaintiffs complained of sexual harassment yet did not return to work after complaining to management and stating that employer must be given sufficient time to remedy the situation); see also Garner v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 807 F.2d 1536, 1538-39 (11th Cir. 1987) (affirming trial court's ruling that plaintiff was not constructively discharged where plaintiff returned to work from maternity leave to learn that her position had been filled, where plaintiff resigned after only one full day back at work and explaining that plaintiff did not realistically give defendant a chance to place plaintiff in a position substantially similar to job held prior to leave); see also Davis v. KARK-TV, Inc., 421 F.3d 699, 706 (8th Cir. 2005) (Summary judgment in favor of employer affirmed on plaintiff's constructive discharge claim where plaintiff quit after employer offered to work with her on scheduling issues. "An employee who quits without giving [her] employer a reasonable chance to work out a problem has not been constructively discharged.") (citation and internal quotation [*38]  marks omitted).29 In Garner, the Eleventh Circuit emphasized that, "[p]art of an employee's obligation to be reasonable is an obligation not to assume the worst, and not to jump to conclusions too fast." Id. at 1539 (emphasis in original) (identifying alternative reasonable responses short of resigning and noting absence of any harassment that might have caused a reasonable person in plaintiff's shoes to resign).
Observing that "[t]he line between discrimination and accommodation is a fine one[,]" the Eleventh Circuit recently acknowledged that an employer's denial of an employee's request for transfer or accommodations could constitute an adverse employment action for purposes of the ADA and form the basis of a constructive discharge claim. Hicks v. City of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, 870 F.3d 1253, 1258-61 (11th Cir. 2017) (ruling on post-trial motions and upholding jury verdict in favor of plaintiff on constructive discharge claim under Title VII's Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k), based upon employer's denial of accommodations in the form of temporary reassignment to alternative duty for breastfeeding employee)30; accord Talley v. Family Dollar Stores of Ohio, Inc., 542 F.3d 1099, 1109 (6th Cir. 2008) ("Assuming that [the plaintiff] was denied a reasonable accommodation that forced her to work in excess of her medical restrictions, a reasonable jury could infer that the defendants knew that [the plaintiff's] [*39]  working conditions would become intolerable to a reasonable person suffering from her particular disability."); Johnson v. Shalala, 991 F.2d 126, 132 (4th Cir. 1993) (recognizing "that a complete failure to accommodate, in the face of repeated requests, might suffice as evidence to show the deliberateness necessary for constructive discharge").
In the instant case, Plaintiff argues that, once her FMLA leave expired, she "was only given the choice to return to LO and Mr. Salley." [Doc. 9 at 17 (citing Am. Compl. ¶ 60)]. "Involuntary resignation may constitute constructive discharge, but only where the employer (1) forces the resignation by coercion or duress, or (2) obtains the resignation by deceiving or misrepresenting a material fact to the employee." Mattingly, 931 F. Supp. 2d at 1189 (citing, inter alia, Hargray v. City of Hallandale, 57 F.3d 1560, 1568 (11th Cir. 1995)); see also Floyd, 968 F. Supp. 2d at 330 (denying motion to dismiss finding that complaint alleged enough to support a plausible inference that defendant knew plaintiff would be forced to quit if her disability were not accommodated and that defendant intended that result where plaintiff's request for accommodation for monocular vision was met with hostility by employer and subsequent request was either not responded to by employer or not answered definitively after initial negative [*40]  response). Plaintiff does not allege here that Defendant deceived or misrepresented any material fact to her, and Plaintiff's allegations concerning duress stem from Plaintiff's aversion to working with and being supervised by Salley. As discussed, Salley was the alleged perpetrator of the sexual harassment, activities prohibited under Title VII. Accepting the facts alleged by Plaintiff as true, Salley made highly offensive, condescending, and inappropriate comments to females in the workplace, and, on one occasion, mentioned physical retaliation when Plaintiff refused to accept an invitation to wear a shirt.31 [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 24-29, 32, 38-39]. Plaintiff does not allege that Mr. Salley was engaging in disability discrimination, yet, the Amended Complaint alleges that Salley's continued presence at LO and supervisory role was a factor.
Plaintiff's allegation that she was "forced to resign" in that her inquiries were not answered such that her only choice was to return to work at LO under Salley's supervision might reasonably give rise to an inference that Plaintiff resigned under duress. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 24-29, 32, 38-39, 52-53]. Critically, Plaintiff alleges that her treating medical provider [*41]  recommended that she not return to work at LO when her FMLA leave expired for health reasons.32 [Am. Compl. ¶ 51]. See, e.g., Hernandez, 977 F. Supp. at 1166-68 (summary judgment precluded on plaintiff's constructive discharge claim where plaintiff with HIV argued that his health was in jeopardy due to defendant's failure to reasonably accommodate disability and where plaintiff's physician attested to discussing plaintiff's stressful working environment with him and offering opinion that plaintiff's employment was an underlying cause of his stress); and see Boutillier v. Hartford Public Schools, 221 F. Supp. 3d 255, 272 (D. Conn. 2016) (summary judgment disposition precluded on constructive discharge theory pursuant to Title VII and state law employment statute where plaintiff received medical recommendation from physician that she not return to working environment due to adverse health effects of stress and anxiety created by defendant's alleged hostility and stating that plaintiff created triable issue under objective standard). Because Plaintiff alleges that her physician advised her not to return to LO, the allegations in support of constructive discharge speak to more than her subjective belief.33 See Hernandez, 977 F. Supp. at 1166-68; see also Boutillier, 221 F. Supp. 3d at 272. As evidenced by the cases discussed herein, the constructive discharge analysis [*42]  is fact-intensive. In the Court's view, at this stage of the case, the allegation that Plaintiff resigned on doctor's orders is sufficient to nudge Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim beyond dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). See Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1966-67.
The Court RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion be DENIED as to this issue and that Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim based upon constructive discharge (Count II) proceed.

2. Count III - Retaliation
Plaintiff alleges in Count III that Defendant subjected her to retaliation in violation of the ADA. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1-79, 80-85]. The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). Section 12117 of the ADA, which speaks to remedies for violation of the ADA's anti-retaliation provision in the employment context, incorporates the remedies available under Title VII. See Albra, 490 F.3d at 832 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a)). The Eleventh Circuit has held that, because these provisions create prohibitions on retaliation that are similar to the prohibition [*43]  on retaliation found in Title VII, courts should evaluate ADA retaliation claims under the same framework used for Title VII retaliation claims. See Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287; and see Mattingly, 931 F. Supp. 2d at 1186-90 (applying burden-shifting paradigm of McDonnell Douglas to ADA retaliation claim in resolving summary judgment motion).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show the same elements generally required for a claim of illegal retaliation under Title VII: (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that there is a causal connection between the expression and the adverse employment action. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287.

a. Protected Activity
The first prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that she engaged in protected expression as it is defined under the ADA. "An employee is protected from discrimination if (1) '[s]he has opposed any practice made an unlawful practice by [the ADA]' (the opposition clause) or (2) '[s]he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [the ADA]' (the participation clause)."34 Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting § 2000e-3(a)); and see EEOC v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 221 F.3d 1171, 1174-75 (11th Cir. 2000) (distinguishing between the opposition clause and the [*44]  participation clause). Under the ADA, this element may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation or the filing of an EEOC charge. See Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016) (first prima facie element of ADA retaliation claim that plaintiff engage in statutorily protected expression satisfied by request for accommodation).
Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges, "On October 23, 2017, Plaintiff requested a transfer as a reasonable accommodation." [Am. Compl. ¶ 43]. Although not cited by Plaintiff in support of the protected activity element, the Court finds that Plaintiff's request for accommodation constitutes protected activity under the ADA.35 See Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258. Plaintiff alleges that her "complaints" during the pendency of her request for accommodation also constitute protected activity. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 52-53, 81]. More specifically, the Amended Complaint alleges that, "[d]uring her FMLA leave, Plaintiff contacted Defendant several times regarding her transfer request" and "complained that her accommodation had not yet been approved." [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 52-53]. The Amended Complaint does not include dates for any of her alleged complaints and does not identify how Plaintiff contacted [*45]  APS to inquire about her transfer request or the means for voicing her complaints. In addition, Plaintiff does not allege that when she complained to APS, she complained about disability discrimination, namely, that APS's delay in deciding and / or APS's denial of her request to transfer was because of her disability. For this reason, as currently plead, the Court does not find that Plaintiff's alleged complaints amount to statutorily protected expression for purposes of the ADA. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287.
The Court finds that the protected expression element is supported by Plaintiff's October 23, 2017, request for accommodation.

b. Adverse Employment Action
As for the second prima facie element of her ADA retaliation claim, Plaintiff must identify an adverse employment action. See Mattingly, 931 F. Supp. 2d at 1187. "[T]he 'adverse action' test applied to retaliation claims is distinct from that applied to disparate treatment claims." Sharpe v. Global Security Int'l, 766 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1291 (S.D. Ala. 2011). In the retaliation context, an adverse employment action includes employer conduct "which has a materially adverse effect on the plaintiff, irrespective of whether it is employment or workplace-related." Crawford, 529 F.3d at 973. The Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff bringing a retaliation claim "must show that [*46]  a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 2415 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Conde, 2017 WL 1395519, at **5-6 (applying Burlington). This standard for determining adverse actions in retaliation claims is "decidedly more relaxed" than that used in discrimination claims. Crawford, 529 F.3d at 973. "Although '[the ADA's] protection against retaliatory discrimination extends to adverse actions which fall short of ultimate employment decisions,' the plaintiff must still demonstrate 'some threshold level of substantiality.'" Cotton v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., 434 F.3d 1227, 1233 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir. 1998)).
Plaintiff contends that she was constructively discharged from her employment and that constructive discharge was an adverse action taken in retaliation for her protected activity under the ADA. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 81, 83]. As discussed supra, the adverse action requirement in the retaliation context is less stringent than in a disability discrimination context. Because the Court deems Plaintiff's allegations of constructive discharge sufficient to survive Rule 12(b)(6) on her disability discrimination claim, discussed supra, the facts are likewise [*47]  adequate to support this element of a retaliation claim. See, e.g., Mattingly, 931 F. Supp. 2d at 1189.
The only remaining issue is whether Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges facts that plausibly show a causal connection.

c. Causal Connection
The third and final element of a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA requires Plaintiff to show that there is a causal connection between the protected expression and the adverse employment action. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. Under the ADA, the causal link element "requires a showing of but-for causation." Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258 (citing Univ. of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2533-34 (2013)). If an employer takes an adverse employment action against an employee shortly after becoming aware of the employee's protected expression, then the close temporal proximity between the two events is sufficient to meet the "but-for" causation requirement. See Adams v. City of Montgomery, 569 Fed. Appx. 769, 773 (11th Cir. 2014) (Title VII case); accord Brungart, 231 F.3d at 799 ("Temporal proximity alone . . . is not sufficient to establish a causal connection when there is unrebutted evidence that the decision maker was not aware of the protected activity."). "But mere temporal proximity, without more, must be very close." Adams, 569 Fed. Appx. at 773 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In the Eleventh Circuit, a "delay of four to nine months is too remote, as a matter of law, to show [*48]  a causal connection." Cazeau v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 614 Fed. Appx. 972, 980 (11th Cir. 2015) (citing Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 2007)).
The Court has already determined that the only protected activity under the ADA is Plaintiff's request for accommodation. According to the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff's request for accommodation was made on October 23, 2017. [Am. Compl. ¶ 43]. Plaintiff resigned her employment on or after January 4, 2018. [Am. Compl. ¶ 56]. Therefore, the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's request for accommodation and her separation from employment is approximately two and a half months. The Eleventh Circuit has held that, without other evidence, "[a] three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough" to establish a causal connection. Thomas, 506 F.3d at 1364 (citation omitted). Here, the two and a half month period between her request for accommodation or transfer and her notice of resignation given January 4, 2018, is right on the cusp of factual scenarios deemed to plausibly allege a causal link for purposes of a retaliation claim. See Adams, 569 Fed. Appx. at 773. For this reason, the Court finds that the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's request for accommodation and her separation from employment is enough to survive Rule 12(b)(6) scrutiny.
 [*49] The Court RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion be DENIED as to this issue and that Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim (Count III) proceed.

C. Count VI - Title IX Claim Alleging Sexual Harassment Based Upon Gender
Defendant argues that Plaintiff, as a former employee of an educational institution, may not bring a claim alleging employment discrimination under Title IX. [Doc. 8-1 at 15-16]. According to Defendant, the Court should find that Title VII is the exclusive remedy for claims for employment discrimination.36 [Doc. 8-1 at 15 (acknowledging Eleventh Circuit has not ever decided)]. In the alternative, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not (and cannot) plausibly allege facts sufficient to state a claim for hostile work environment based upon gender in that the facts alleged, taken as true, fall short of both the severity and pervasiveness requirements. [Doc. 8-1 at 16-17]. Defendant has the better argument on both points.
First, while the Eleventh Circuit has not had an opportunity to decide this issue, the weight of legal authority holds that Title VII preempts relief under Title IX for employment discrimination. Title IX provides, "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded [*50]  from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . ." 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Lakoski v. James, 66 F.3d 751 (5th Cir. 1995), "that Title VII provides the exclusive remedy for individuals alleging employment discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded educational institutions." Id. at 753; see also Cooper v. Georgia Gwinnett College, 2016 WL 6246888, at **5-7 (N.D. Ga. September 16, 2016) (agreeing with courts holding that Title VII preempts Title IX relief for teacher-employees of educational institutions subject to Title IX), report and recommendation adopted by 2016 WL 6217124 (N.D. Ga. October 25, 2016); accord Torres v. School Dist. of Manatee Cty., Florida, 2014 WL 4185364 (M.D. Fla. August 22, 2014); Blalock v. Dale Cty. Bd. of Educ., 84 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 1298 (M.D. Ala. 1999) (same). As explained in Lakoski, "[g]iven the availability of a private remedy under Title VII for aggrieved employees," to allow relief under Title IX "would disrupt a carefully balanced remedial scheme for redressing employment discrimination by employers such as [universities]." Lakoski, 66 F.3d at 754; and see Cooper, 2016 WL 6246888, at **6-7. Relying heavily on Lakoski, the Torres court summarized the issue and its ruling as follows:
There is no question that Title IX prohibits employment discrimination: employment discrimination comes within the prohibition of Title IX. . . . The question . . . is whether teachers, such as [Plaintiff], have a private right of action for [*51]  [discrimination] under Title IX when such teachers complain that they are the victims of sexual harassment. . . . [S]uch a private right of action does not exist under Title IX because it is preempted by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. . . .
If the Court were to hold otherwise, it would eviscerate Title VII's technical and administrative requirements, thereby giving plaintiffs who work at federally funded [educational] institutions unfettered ability to bring what are in reality Title VII sexual discrimination claims without adhering to the same rules required of every other employment discrimination plaintiff in the country.
Torres, 2014 WL 4185364, at **4-6 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Cooper, 2016 WL 6246888, at **6-7 (applying Lakoski and Torres). Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff's employment discrimination claims alleging a sexually hostile work environment are preempted by Title VII.
With respect to the sufficiency of the complaint, Plaintiff's factual allegations are insufficient for the reasons discussed below. In order to state a plausible claim for a sexually hostile work environment under Title IX, Plaintiff would have to allege, inter alia, that the discrimination was "'so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively [*52]  bars the victim's access to an educational opportunity or benefit.'" Williams v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. System of Georgia, 477 F.3d 1282, 1293 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Davis v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 119 S. Ct. 1661, 1666 (1999)) (looking to Title VII hostile work environment law and setting out elements for establishing Title IX action). In Count VI, Plaintiff alleges that she was subject to a hostile work environment in light of the sexually explicit comments made by Salley. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 107-08]. Plaintiff contends that the sexually explicit nature of Salley's comments and behavior establish that they were based on gender and that the work environment was hostile due to gender. [Am. Compl. ¶ 108]. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to take prompt remedial action despite being made aware of Salley's comments. [Am. Compl. ¶ 109]. Plaintiff bases her hostile work environment claim on the following factual allegations:
• During her employment at LO, Mr. Salley harassed female employees, including Plaintiff.
• Mr. Salley told another female teacher that her "nipples [were] making [him] hard."
• Female teachers, including Plaintiff, filed complaints against Mr. Salley.
• On July 28, 2017, Mr. Salley attempted to convince Plaintiff to wear a shirt he provided.
• Plaintiff told Mr. Salley that she did not wish to wear the shirt he provided. [*53] 
• Mr. Salley responded by telling another teacher to "knock the shit out of" Plaintiff.
• On September 26, 2017, Plaintiff received a poor evaluation.
• Plaintiff advised Mr. Salley that she never had any Principal speak to her in such a manner.
• Mr. Salley told Plaintiff, "Oh, so you were a virgin and I was your first?"
[Am. Compl. ¶¶ 24-29, 32, 38-39]. Plaintiff identifies only a handful of events where Salley allegedly made sexually explicit comments in the workplace, and the known dates reveal incidents approximately two months apart (7/28/17, 9/26/17). The alleged statement about the female teacher's nipples, the most graphic or explicit comment, did not even involve the Plaintiff, and the Amended Complaint does not allege that Plaintiff witnessed or overheard the comment. [Am. Compl. ¶ 25]. Plaintiff cannot rely on incidents that she did not personally observe or witness to support her own claims of harassment. See, e.g., Ogletree v. Necco, 2016 WL 11467577, at *11 (N.D. Ga. November 9, 2016) (citing Adams v. Austal, U.S.A., LLC, 754 F.3d 1240, 1250 (11th Cir. 2014) (holding that claims of racial harassment could not be supported with evidence of incidents of harassment the plaintiff did not experience firsthand)), report and recommendation adopted by 2016 WL 7010869 (N.D. Ga. November 30, 2016). Accepting the facts alleged by Plaintiff as true, Salley made [*54]  highly offensive, condescending, and inappropriate comments to females in the workplace, and, on one occasion, mentioned physical retaliation when Plaintiff refused to accept an invitation to wear a shirt. [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 24-29, 32, 38-39]. Even if the Court found that Title VII was not Plaintiff's exclusive remedy, the Court would find Plaintiff's allegations insufficient to plausibly allege actionable discrimination under Title IX as collectively they fail to satisfy the severity or pervasiveness requirements. See Williams, 477 F.3d at 1293.
The Court RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDS that the Defendant's motion be GRANTED as to this issue and that Plaintiff's claim alleging violation of Title IX (Count VI) be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

IV. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons and cited authority, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion [Doc. 8] to dismiss the amended complaint be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as follows:
(1) That Defendant's motion be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's Title VII claim alleging retaliation (Count IV) and that this claim be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE;
(2) That Defendant's motion be GRANTED with respect to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim alleging failure to accommodate pursuant [*55]  to the ADA and Rehab Act (Counts I, V) and that these claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE;
(3) That Defendant's motion be DENIED as to Plaintiff's claim alleging disability discrimination based upon constructive discharge under the ADA (Count II);
(4) That Defendant's motion be DENIED as to Plaintiff's claim alleging retaliation under the ADA (Count III); and
(5) That Defendant's motion be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim alleging violation of Title IX (Count VI) and that the claim be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
If the District Court adopts the instant R & R, Plaintiff's ADA claims alleged in Counts II and III will proceed.
SO RECOMMENDED THIS 3rd day of May, 2019.
