MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
This matter is before the Court on defendant Louis DeJoy's ("DeJoy") Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Filing No. 18). Plaintiff Julie J. Eggen ("Eggen") brought suit against DeJoy, who serves as the Postmaster General for the United States Postal Service ("USPS"), for employment discrimination based on her sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. ("Title VII"), and based on her disability, in violation of Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehabilitation Act"), as amended 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.1 She also asserts USPS failed to accommodate her disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. For the reasons stated below, USPS's motion for partial summary judgment is granted.

I. BACKGROUND2
In March 1997, Eggen began working for USPS in the Omaha Processing and Distribution Center. Eggen, a disabled veteran, had a documented disability of her right knee and claims other undocumented disabilities. In December 2014, Eggen had a partial-knee replacement surgery. Upon returning to work, she was granted four hours of "light-duty" work per day and performed "full-duty" work for the remaining four hours. But [*2]  even after surgery, the condition of her knee continued to worsen. Eggen made further requests for light duty, such as to sit while working, based on her continued knee pain and additional pain in her shoulder. She made those requests to USPS on August 4, 2015; February 16, 2016; March 15, 2016; and August 30, 2016. She also submitted a workers'-compensation claim in October 20153 based on the injury to her shoulder.

A. Equal-Employment-Office Reports
USPS displayed Poster 72 on its employee bulletin board, which provides employees with information on how to request Equal Employment Office ("EEO") counseling following any discriminatory acts. It was posted in the employee breakroom next to the employee time clock and in the lobby. Poster 72 states that individuals must bring "complaints to the attention of the EEO office by requesting counseling within 45 days" of the discrimination. USPS also provided Eggen with a publication titled, "What You Need to Know About EEO" when she made contact with the EEO counselor on September 17, 2015. That form stated she "must contact" the EEO office "within 45 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory action." Finally, Eggen received training on June [*3]  23, 2016, which included information on the requirement to contact an EEO counselor within 45 days of the discriminatory act. Eggen does not otherwise dispute that she was made aware of the requirement to contact an EEO counselor within 45 days of an alleged discriminatory act.
In fact, Eggen did comply with the requirement to contact an EEO counselor within 45 days of an alleged discriminatory act. In addition to making light-duty requests directly to USPS throughout 2015 and 2016, Eggen contacted an USPS EEO counselor on September 8, 2015, and September 17, 2015, alleging sex and disability discrimination. The two complaints were processed together. Eggen cited four instances when she was sent home without working a full shift and complained that her August 4, 2015, request for light duty was denied. Eggen filed a formal discrimination complaint on December 22, 2015, relating to two of those instances. More specifically, she complained that (1) she was sent home on August 26, 2015, after working just six hours, and (2) from September 11-15, 2015, she was sent home and missed a total of 21.39 hours of work. USPS investigated both issues and agrees Eggen exhausted her administrative [*4]  remedies related to those instances.
About two years later, on October 16, 2017, Eggen again contacted an EEO counselor, alleging that on October 4, 2017, she was assigned to work on the Delivery Bar Code Sorter #11 machine and was denied light duty on numerous occasions. She filed a formal EEO complaint regarding her assignment to work on the Delivery Bar Code Sorter #11 machine on January 25, 2018. USPS investigated the October 4, 2017, incident but did not investigate the light-duty allegations because those related to her previous case originating in September 2015. USPS does not otherwise discuss this October 2017 claim in its briefing.

B. Reasonable-Accommodation Requests
To determine whether an individual qualifies for a reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act, USPS utilizes a District Reasonable Accommodation Committee ("DRAC"). According to USPS, "Supervisors or managers must refer a request for accommodation to the DRAC when an employee has requested an accommodation or modification of his or her work assignment or job duties based on a medical reason and one or more factors" set forth in its handbook. If the employee does qualify, the DRAC "works with the individual and management [*5]  to evaluate potential accommodations, including transfer or reassignment."
On December 5, 2015, Eggen's supervisor submitted a Management's Referral for Reasonable Accommodation Consideration form for Eggen, detailing her inability to lift objects above her shoulder, her capacity to work only six hours each day, and her limits on "twisting, pushing, and pulling." The form stated that Eggen refused to participate in the reasonable-accommodation process with DRAC. To confirm her refusal, DRAC sent Eggen a memo by certified mail on December 9, 2015, which she received on December 18, 2015, stating she was offered access to but refused to engage in the reasonable-accommodation process. The memo also notified her that her needs could not be addressed without her participation but that DRAC would reopen her file if she wanted to participate. Eggen did not respond to DRAC's December 9, 2015, letter, and DRAC was unable to facilitate a meeting between Eggen and management.
In March 2019, Eggen settled "any claims for lost and/or reduced leave hours or work hours as asserted" in her EEO claims with USPS. The settlement was to "completely resolve any and all light duty (or related) claims up to [*6]  the date of this settlement." The settlement agreement did leave open her ability to "seek[] damages, except the work hours and leave hours reduced and/or lost from August 4, 2015 through February 6, 2018."

II. DISCUSSION

A. Standard of Review
Summary judgment must be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden to demonstrate there is no genuine dispute of material fact. See Lipp v. Cargill Meat Sols. Corp., 911 F.3d 537, 543 (8th Cir. 2018). "If the movant does so, the nonmovant must respond by submitting evidentiary materials that set out specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Gannon Int'l, Ltd. v. Blocker, 684 F.3d 785, 792 (8th Cir. 2012). The nonmovant may not simply rest on allegations it made in its complaint. See Wilson v. Miller, 821 F.3d 963, 970 (8th Cir. 2016) (noting that "at the summary judgment stage, [a plaintiff] cannot rely solely upon the bare allegations in her Complaint.").

B. Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies
USPS argues Eggen asserts five discriminatory acts and the causes of action relating to four of them should be dismissed because Eggen did not exhaust her administrative remedies. Before bringing discrimination claims in federal court, "plaintiffs must exhaust available [*7]  administrative remedies." Bailey v. U.S. Postal Serv., 208 F.3d 652, 654 (8th Cir. 2000). For a federal postal employee, this requires they contact an EEO counselor "within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory" to try and resolve the matter informally. 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a). This requirement applies to claims made under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. See Bailey, 208 F.3d at 654 (Title VII); Ballard v. Rubin, 284 F.3d 957, 964 (8th Cir. 2002) (Rehabilitation Act). USPS contends Eggen failed to initiate contact with an EEO counselor within 45 days of four discrete discriminatory acts.
While there are certain exceptions to this 45-day deadline, see 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(2), Eggen does not assert any apply to her. Instead, Eggen argues she raises only "a single issue, not five discrete incidents" because all her "requests for light duty were related to the disability of her knee." Eggen states she timely contacted the EEO counselor in September 2015 regarding the disability of her knee, and as Eggen sees it, that report was sufficient to cover every additional request (and subsequent denial) for light duty. While such a theory is cognizable for a hostile-work-environment claim, Eggen does not raise one. See, e.g., Rowe v. Hussmann Corp., 381 F.3d 775, 779 (8th Cir. 2004) (explaining a hostile work environment is a claim "based on the 'cumulative effect of individual acts,'" so such a claim is "timely if 'an [*8]  act contributing to [the] claim occur[ed] within the filing period.'" (quoting Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 115, 117 (2002))). Without citing any cases in support of her position, Eggen proposes that each discriminatory act does not need to be addressed individually. She is mistaken.
USPS correctly argues that Eggen needed to administratively exhaust each discrete act of discrimination. "Each incident of discrimination . . . constitutes a separate actionable 'unlawful employment practice.'" Morgan, 536 U.S. at 114. An employer's denial of a request for a reasonable accommodation is a discrete act of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. Dick v. Dickinson State Univ., 826 F.3d 1054, 1059 (8th Cir. 2016). Each discrete act—even if related to another—needs to be exhausted. Morgan, 536 U.S. at 114 ("[D]iscrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges."); see also Betz v. Chertoff, 578 F.3d 929, 938 (8th Cir. 2009) (finding an employee was "required [] to contact an EEO counselor within 45 days" of each discriminatory act, and her failure to do so "barred [her] from bringing an action based specifically on those occurrences").
USPS asserts that Eggen failed to exhaust her discrimination claims except "whether Eggen was discriminated on the basis of her disability when Defendant denied her August 2015 request for light duty." [*9]  As to that occasion, USPS acknowledges Eggen did exhaust by contacting an EEO counselor in September 2015. Eggen did not, however, contact an EEO counselor within 45 days after (1) she was sent home without pay in October 2015; (2) her February 2016 request for light duty was denied and hours reduced; (3) her March 2016 request for light duty was denied; (4) her standing hours increased in September 2016, and her request for light duty was again denied.
As to those four occasions,4 USPS's motion for summary judgment is granted on all Eggen's causes of action.5 Remaining, at this point, are Eggen's disability6 discrimination claims involving her August 4, 2015, light-duty request and related EEO report. But as the Court discusses next, her failure-to-accommodate claim as to that occurrence will also be dismissed.

C. Reasonable Accommodation
Under the Rehabilitation Act, "[t]he failure to make reasonable accommodations in the employment of a disabled employee is a separate form of prohibited discrimination," which is "framed in terms of the failure to fulfill an affirmative duty . . . to reasonably accommodate the disabled individual's limitations." Peebles v. Potter, 354 F.3d 761, 766-67 (8th Cir. 2004) (explaining such a claim is analyzed under a "modified [*10]  burden-shifting analysis," not the familiar McDonnell Douglas framework).7 When an "employee truly and affirmatively requested accommodation," the employer's duty is to engage in an "'informal, interactive process' between the employer and the employee, identifying the limitations arising from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations." Ballard, 284 F.3d at 960 (quoting Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 951 (8th Cir. 1999)).
To show that an employer failed to participate in this interactive process, the employee must demonstrate that [(1)] the employer knew about the employee's disability, [(2)] the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability, [(3)] the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations, [(4)] the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith.
Ballard, 284 F.3d at 960.
As to Eggen's remaining allegation of discrimination—the denial of her "August 2015 request for light duty,"—USPS "concedes Eggen had a disability" and made a request for accommodation. Nevertheless, USPS argues Eggen's failure-to-accommodate claim fails because she refused to engage in the interactive process with USPS. See, e.g., Nahal v. Allina Health Sys., 842 F. App'x 9, 10 (8th Cir. 2021) (unpublished per curiam) (affirming defendant's [*11]  motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's reasonable-accommodation claim because "[t]he breakdown in the interactive accommodation process was not because of [the defendant]").
USPS attempted to engage in the interactive process with Eggen, which she does not dispute. Her supervisor submitted a referral to DRAC, explaining Eggen had shoulder and knee pain and was unable to lift above her shoulder; could only work six hours per day; and was limited to twisting, pushing, and pulling for six hours each day. On her supervisor's referral form, he indicated that Eggen stated she did not wish to participate in the DRAC process. Eggen was notified in writing that DRAC would not facilitate a meeting but would reopen her case if she wanted to participate. Eggen never contacted DRAC or asked to have her case reopened. Instead, she now argues "nowhere in Postal Service rules and regulations is the DRAC procedure made mandatory or deemed the only 'interactive process' to determine accommodations for disabilities," and states she repeatedly asked for light duty and to sit while working.
Even so, USPS has established that it attempted to engage in the interactive process with Eggen, and she impeded [*12]  that process by failing to participate. Id.; see also Kratzer v. Rockwell Collins, Inc., 398 F.3d 1040, 1045 (8th Cir. 2005) (noting "the breakdown in the interactive process was due to [the employee's] failure to provide an updated evaluation" and affirming a grant of summary judgment in favor of employer). Eggen presents no facts to the contrary. USPS argues, and the Court agrees, no reasonable jury could find USPS did not make a good-faith effort to participate in an informal interactive process with Eggen. See Faidley v. United Parcel Serv. of Am., Inc., 889 F.3d 933, 944 (8th Cir. 2018) (finding "a reasonable jury could not find that UPS acted in bad faith" when the employer "participated in the interactive process prescribed in its ADA Procedural Compliance Manual" and discussed options with the employee). USPS followed its procedures, contacted Eggen, and she caused the breakdown in the interactive process by failing to respond or otherwise engage with USPS.

D. Lost Wages and Punitive Damages
Eggen concedes in her brief that "her claims for lost wages have been previously settled," and she is not pursuing lost wages or punitive damages in this lawsuit.
In light of the foregoing,
IT IS ORDERED:
1. Defendant Louis DeJoy's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Filing No. 18) is granted in full.
2. Plaintiff Julie Eggen's claims for [*13]  lost wages and punitive damages are dismissed as moot.
3. Remaining are Plaintiff Julie Eggen's non-contested disability-discrimination claims stemming from August 4, 2015, and October 16, 2017.
Dated this 28th day of December 2021.
