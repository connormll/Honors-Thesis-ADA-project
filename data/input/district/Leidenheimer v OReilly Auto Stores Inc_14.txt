Opinion



ORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
[Dkt. No. 34]
Presently before the Court is Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. After considering the parties' submissions, the Court adopts the following order.

I. BACKGROUND
Defendant O'Reilly Automotive Stores, Inc. is operated by Defendant CSK Auto, Inc. (collectively, "Defendants" or "O'Reilly"). (See First Am. Comp. ("FAC") ¶¶ 9-10, 13-14; Defs. Mot. Summ. J. at 1.) Plaintiff Mark Leidenheimer is a sixty-three-year-old, Caucasian male. (FAC ¶ 12.) Beginning in May 2010, Plaintiff worked for Defendant O'Reilly as an Assistant Manager and Parts Clerk. (Id. at 15; Decl. of Timothy A. Pico in Opp'n Defs. Mot. Summ. J. ("Pico Decl.") Ex. 30 to Leidenheimer Depo.) [*2]  During his employment, Plaintiff received three outstanding customer service awards. (Pico Decl. Ex. 2.)

A. Time Card Alteration Complaint
Around May 2012, Plaintiff alleges that he was directed by O'Reilly managers to alter employees' time cards to eliminate meal break penalties. (Pico Decl. Ex. 1 at 176:10-25, 180:7-183:6, 196:15-197:1.) After he was instructed to alter employees' time cards, Plaintiff met with Defendants' District Manager Ben Gutierrez ("Gutierrez") to discuss Plaintiff's concern over the meal break violations. (Defs. Notice of Lodgement of Exhibits ISO Mot. Summ. J. ("NOL") Ex. E at 181:6-183:6.) Plaintiff alleges that during this meeting Gutierrez said, "[P]erhaps we're putting too much on you, and there's plenty of jobs out there for elderly people like you if you can't handle this one." (Id. at 183:17-20.)
On June 11, 2012, Plaintiff wrote an email to Defendants' Divisional Vice-President Chad Keel ("Keel") regarding these meal break violations and also the discrimination Plaintiff felt he was experiencing based on his age and race. (Pico Decl. Ex. 30 to Leidenheimer Depo.)
On July 3, 2012, Plaintiff filed a class action lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court [*3]  against Defendants O'Reilly and CSK Auto, Inc. for violations of the California Labor Code and the Business and Professions Code. (Pl. Req. Judicial Notice ("RJN") at Ex. A.) In the complaint, Plaintiff alleged that Defendants' managers were instructing Plaintiff to illegally alter employees' time to avoid meal break penalties. (Id.)
On July 11, 2012, Keel and Defendants' Human Resources Specialist Don Beck ("Beck") met with Plaintiff to discuss the meal break claims and the discrimination. (Pico Decl. Ex. 9 at 205:21-208:21; see also Ex. 15.) On August 27, 2012, Plaintiff and Defendants signed a settlement agreement to resolve Plaintiff's individual meal break claims. (NOL at Ex. Z.) Plaintiff asserts his class action suit is ongoing. (Pl. Opp'n at 9 n.3.)
In or around early 2013, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' District Manager Oscar Corona ("Corona") told Plaintiff, "my people work for the wage and the satisfaction that doing the job brings," which Plaintiff took to refer to Plaintiff's different race. (NOL Ex. E at 361:14-364:10.) Plaintiff alleges that the same or similar statement was also made by Gutierrez on a separate occasion. (Id. at 362:6-19.) Corona also told Plaintiff's [*4]  co-worker Rafael Arreola ("Arreola") that Plaintiff was "too old and shouldn't be closing." (Decl. Rafael Arreola ¶ 6.)

B. Plaintiff Is Hospitalized
On May 16, 2013, Plaintiff worked his last shift for O'Reilly Auto Parts. (NOL Ex. E at 80:14-16.) The next day, Plaintiff started suffering severe abdominal and leg pain, which resulted in a trip to the hospital where he was diagnosed with kidney stones and released. (Id. at 80:17-83:20, 87:17-88:17.) Plaintiff informed Defendants that he would not be able to come into work because of his hospital stay. (Id. at 298:4-299:22; NOL Ex. M.) Plaintiff and Defendants had further communications regarding Plaintiff's condition and ability to come to work. (NOL Ex. M; NOL Ex. A at 44:8-45:13; NOL Ex. C at 89:17-100:8.) Defendants' managers also internally communicated about Plaintiff's illness and absence from work. (NOL Ex. C at 94:25-100:8; NOL Ex. L at 35:15-21.)
On May 22, 2013, Store Manager Will Salguero emailed Gary Morse from Human Resources and Corona regarding Plaintiff's absence, noting that Salguero was "not sure when [Plaintiff is] coming back or what [Plaintiff's] condition is." (NOL Ex. M.) Morse wrote a note on an email — presumably [*5]  Salguero's email — regarding Plaintiff's absence that said "DM-Involved in lawsuit," with "DM" referring to "district manager." (Pico Decl. Ex. 10 at 147-49.)
On May 23, 2013, Plaintiff was readmitted to the hospital where he stayed until June 23, 2013. (NOL Ex. E at 143:2-20, 300:8-17.) Plaintiff called Salguero on his way to the hospital and told Salguero that Plaintiff expected to be in the hospital for "at least a week or two." (Id. at 300:8-17.) Salguero told Plaintiff to call Corona. (Id. at 300:18-23.) Plaintiff let Corona know that he was in the hospital for "another couple weeks at least." (Id. at 312:4-314:3.) Corona asked Plaintiff to call back when he had more information about his condition, how long he was staying in the hospital, and when he would be back to work. (Id. at 312:13-314:3.)
Under Human Resources' instructions, Corona contacted Defendants' Leave of Absence Coordinator to find out if Plaintiff was qualified for a leave of absence. (NOL Ex. C at 106:12-108:16.) The Leave of Absence Coordinator confirmed that Plaintiff was eligible for a leave of absence and instructed Corona to tell Plaintiff about his eligibility. (Id. at 109:20-112:11.)
On May 30, 2013, Salguero [*6]  emailed Corona and Morse stating that he had called the Leave of Absence team per Corona's request and James Updegraff ("Updegraff") had confirmed Plaintiff was eligible for a leave of absence. (NOL Ex. A at 52:7-54:2; NOL Ex. N.) The email also stated that Updegraff would be sending Plaintiff a letter explaining the leave of absence in the next day or two. (NOL Ex. N.)

C. The Disputed Phone Call
Plaintiff alleges that on or around May 25, 2013, Plaintiff called Corona a second time from the hospital. (NOL Ex. E at 314:15-315:19.) The content of this phone call is disputed by the parties. (See, e.g., Defs. Mot. Summ. J. at 5, 10; Pl. Opp'n at 4-5; Def. Reply to Pl. Opp'n to Statement of Uncontroverted Facts at Nos. 9-14.)
Plaintiff declares that he "went to great lengths to keep the company informed of [his] medical condition while [he] was hospitalized for the purpose of preserving [his] job." (Mark Leidenheimer Decl. ("Leidenheimer Decl.") ¶ 24; see also NOL Ex. E at 316:11-24.) Plaintiff told Corona that he was unsure of his diagnosis but he had eye problems, was in pain, and had a "blood apron." (NOL Ex. E at 316:12-24.) Plaintiff told Corona that he "would need to go out on disability [*7]  leave." (Leidenheimer Decl. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff alleges that Corona "acted like he didn't hear [Plaintiff] when [Plaintiff] said [he] wanted to go out on disability." (NOL Ex. E at 317:18-19.)
Instead, Corona responded to Plaintiff's mention of disability by asking, "[Y]ou're going to need your last check then; right?" (Id. at 317:17-21.) Plaintiff responded "yes," believing Corona was referring to the check from his last pay period. (Id. at 317:22-318:2.) Corona told Plaintiff that Plaintiff would need to sign an authorization for the funds. (Id. at 318:3-4.) Plaintiff stated that it would be hard to do because he was in the hospital. (Id. at 318:5-6.) Corona said that Plaintiff could do an electronic signature. (Id. at 318:16-20.) Corona said that he had a person with him as a witness and that when he asked if Plaintiff wanted his final check, Plaintiff could say "yes" and that would signify an electronic signature. (Id.) Corona then asked, "Do you want me to release your last check to you?" to which Plaintiff answered "yes." (Id. at 318:21-24.)
In Plaintiff's declaration, he states that he had asked Corona about disability paperwork and Corona replied something to the effect of "I'll [*8]  get that started," and "Don't worry, I'll take care of that." (Leidenheimer Decl. ¶ 13.) This phone call was the last time Plaintiff spoke with anyone affiliated with O'Reilly. (NOL Ex. E at 320:10-12.)
Defendants offer a different version of this last conversation between Plaintiff and Corona. According to Defendants, sometime before May 31, 2013, but after Corona learned that Plaintiff was eligible for a leave of absence, Plaintiff and Corona spoke on the phone. (NOL Ex. C at 114:23-115:5.) Corona asked if Plaintiff knew when Plaintiff would be coming back and Plaintiff said he did not. (Id. at 115:12-14.) Corona told Plaintiff that Plaintiff qualified for a leave of absence and asked if he would like to take that option. (Id. at 115:15-20.) Plaintiff said he would think about it and call back with a decision. (Id. at 116:6-22.)
Plaintiff called back later and told Corona that he could not see himself returning to work because of his health issues. (Id. at 124:5-9.) Plaintiff said he would take care of it on his own with Medicare. (Id. at 124:11-125:11.) Corona told Plaintiff he would call the leave of absence department to let them know his decision and then call Plaintiff back. ( [*9] Id. at 125:14-18.) Corona and Plaintiff spoke again and Corona told Plaintiff that based on Corona's conversation with the leave of absence team, Corona needed a written statement regarding Plaintiff's resignation. (Id. at 133:1-15, 135:4-13.) However, because Plaintiff could not write or see, Corona said that Plaintiff could resign over the phone if Corona had a witness with him. (Id. at 135:5-13.) Then Plaintiff told Corona "I, Mark Leidenheimer, assistant store manager from O'Reilly Auto Parts, resign my position." (Id. at 135:18-24.) Corona testified at deposition that he could not recall if he had a witness there, and then said that Salguero was present during this phone call. (Id. at 135:2-23.) However, Salguero does not remember being present for the call. (Pico Decl. Ex. 3 at 73:12-21.) Keel testified that he was present for the call, but did not hear Plaintiff through the phone. (NOL Ex. O at 65:3-67:10.)

D. After Plaintiff's Termination
On June 5, 2013, O'Reilly mailed Plaintiff a letter confirming Plaintiff's alleged voluntary termination and stating that Plaintiff was aware of his rights and declined to take a leave. (NOL Ex. R.) Plaintiff claims he never received the letter. [*10]  (Pico Decl. Ex. 1 at 332:13-333:22.) While Plaintiff was still in the hospital, he received paperwork regarding his 401k and his final check, which is when Plaintiff states he learned he was fired. (Id. at 68:4-25.) Thereafter, Plaintiff filed for state disability benefits. (Leidenheimer Decl. ¶ 30.)
On November 25, 2013, Plaintiff filed the present action in California state court. (Defs. Notice of Removal Ex. A.) Defendants removed the case on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. (Defs. Notice of Removal at 2-5.) On January 22, 2014, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint alleging: (1) Interference in Violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"); (2) Retaliation in Violation of CFRA; (3) Wrongful Termination; (4) Disability Discrimination in Violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (5) Failure to Accommodate Medical Disability in Violation of FEHA; (6) Failure to Engage in Interactive Process in Violation of FEHA; (7) Discrimination on the Basis of Age in Violation of FEHA; (8) Discrimination on the Basis of Race in Violation of FEHA; (9) Violation of Labor Code § 1102.5 regarding whistle blower retaliation; and (10) Declaratory Relief based on the above causes [*11]  of action. (FAC.) Defendants have now filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show "that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). All reasonable inferences from the evidence must be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). If the moving party does not bear the burden of proof at trial, it is entitled to summary judgment if it can demonstrate that "there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.
Once the moving party meets its burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party opposing the motion, who must "set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. Summary judgment is warranted if a party "fails to make a showing sufficient [*12]  to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. A genuine issue exists if "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party," and material facts are those "that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. There is no genuine issue of fact "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).
It is not the court's task "to scour the record in search of a genuine issue of triable fact." Keenan v. Allan, 91 F.3d 1275, 1278 (9th Cir.1996). Counsel has an obligation to lay out their support clearly. Carmen v. San Francisco Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir.2001). The court "need not examine the entire file for evidence establishing a genuine issue of fact, where the evidence is not set forth in the opposition papers with adequate references so that it could conveniently be found." Id.

III. DISCUSSION
Defendants have moved for summary judgment on each of Plaintiff's ten claims.

A. CFRA Claims
The California Family Rights Act ("CFRA") requires employers to grant any qualified employee's request "to take up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12-month period for family care and medical leave." Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(a). The [*13]  CFRA is contained within the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"). See Cal. Gov't Code § 12900 et seq. CFRA claims are California's equivalent of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") as the "CFRA adopts the language of the FMLA and California state courts have held that the same standards apply." Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1132 (9th Cir. 2003)
Plaintiff alleges two causes of action under the CFRA: (1) Interference and (2) Retaliation.

1. Interference
Defendants have three main arguments against Plaintiff's interference claim. First, Defendants argue that Plaintiff was not harmed or prejudiced by any alleged violation of the CFRA because Plaintiff was not able to return to work within the twelve-week time period provided by the CFRA. (Def. Mot. Summ. J. at 21-22.) Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiff is estopped from alleging harm because he received disability benefits after the leave time would have ended. (Id.) Finally, Defendants argue that Defendants did not interfere with Plaintiff's CFRA rights because Defendants had no notice and because Defendants offered Plaintiff CFRA leave and Plaintiff declined to accept it. (Id. at 18.)
Plaintiff responds that he has established a claim for interference with his CFRA rights because he was eligible [*14]  for CFRA leave, he informed his employer that he was in the hospital and would need disability leave, and he was consequently fired. (Pl. Opp'n at 16-17.) Plaintiff alleges that he never received notice of his CFRA eligibility, written or otherwise. (Leidenheimer Decl. ¶ 21; Pico Decl. Ex. 1 at 72:5-74:21.) He argues that Defendants' failure to comply with the statutory notice requirement constitutes inference with his CFRA rights. (Pl. Opp'n at 17-18.)
Plaintiff states he was harmed because he was not aware of his benefits and the twelve-week deadline to return to work. (Pl. Opp'n at 18.) Plaintiff also argues that the fact that he claimed disability benefits does not mean that he could not work with accommodations because disability benefits applications do not take into account the possibility of working with reasonable accommodations. (Pl. Opp'n at 18.)
Under the CFRA it is unlawful for an employer to "interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the attempt to exercise, any right provided" under the CFRA. Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(t). To establish a claim for interference with CFRA rights, the plaintiff must show that "(1) he is an eligible employee; (2) his employer is an employer under the FMLA; [*15]  (3) he was entitled to take leave; (4) he gave notice of his intention to take leave; and (5) the defendant denied him the benefits to which he was entitled under the FMLA." Hurley v. Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Inc., No. C 05-05028 JSW, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15760, 2006 WL 708656, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2006). An interference claim under the CFRA does not involve the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis. Faust v. California Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 879, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007). Here, the parties do not dispute the first three elements of the claim. Plaintiff was an eligible employee, Defendants are an employer under the CFRA, and Plaintiff was entitled to take leave. (See Pico Decl. Ex. 5 at 109:21-110:24)

a. Harm
The first issue is whether Plaintiff is precluded from his CFRA interference claim because he cannot prove that he was harmed by the violation.
Plaintiff's deposition testimony is unclear: Plaintiff alleges at different points that he could have returned to work with accommodations in August 2013 or October 2013 or August 2014. (Defs. Notice of Lodgement of Exs. ISO Defs. Reply ("RNOL") Ex. 7 at 98:24-119:25.) He states now that he "was nervous and became confused as to the dates" during his deposition but that August 2013 is the date he could have returned. (Leidenheimer Decl. ¶ 28.)
Defendants argue that if Plaintiff could not return until October 2013, Plaintiff would have [*16]  surpassed the twelve-week CFRA leave period. (Defs. Mot. Summ. J. at 22.) Defendants also points to the fact that Plaintiff was on disability until May 2014. (Id.) Thus, Defendants argue that Plaintiff did not suffer harm from any alleged violation of his CFRA rights. (Id.)
But Plaintiff has raised the issue that Defendants interfered with his CFRA rights by never offering him leave at all. Further, it is unknown whether Plaintiff could have returned to work within twelve weeks with reasonable accommodations because Plaintiff did not get an opportunity to return to work to find out. Plaintiff alleges and has evidence that he was harmed by Defendants' failure to notify him of his right to leave and if Plaintiff was never offered CFRA leave, then he was harmed. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact as to whether Defendants failed to notify Plaintiff of his CFRA rights.

b. Estoppel
The second issue is whether Plaintiff is precluded from his CFRA interference claim because he is judicially estopped from alleging that he could return to work in twelve weeks due to his statements on his disability benefits applications.
Judicial estoppel applies when [*17]  a party presents a totally inconsistent position in a second litigation from a previous litigation for the purposes of seeking some advantage in the current litigation. See Rissetto v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 343, 94 F.3d 597, 600-02 (9th Cir. 1996). The concern is that the party is "playing fast and loose with the court" and causing the court harm by manipulating the court to achieve the party's ends. Id. But judicial estoppel is discretionary and is not meant to prevent a party from introducing new evidence or explaining previous statements. See, e.g., Stoll v. The Hartford, No. 05-CV-1907IEG (LSP), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81781, 2006 WL 3955826, at *11 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2006). In Stoll, the court held that judicial estoppel did not apply to a plaintiff in a disability case "simply because she claimed to be temporarily totally disabled on her application for workers' compensation and disability benefits" because "her claim for reasonable accommodation can be reconciled with a benefits application stating that she cannot work without accommodation." Id.
Similar to the plaintiff in Stoll, Plaintiff here wrote "yes" to the question on the disability benefits application about being disabled and unable to do his "regular work." And as the court held in Stoll, this statement is not inconsistent with the ability to work with an accommodation. Therefore, judicial estoppel does not apply here.

c. Notice [*18] 
The third issue is whether Plaintiff's statements to Corona and Salguero adequately notified Defendants that Plaintiff needed to take a CFRA leave.
Both employer and employee are obligated to give notice to facilitate the CFRA leave. First, an employee must notify his or her employer of the need for CFRA. The California Code of Regulations states:
[A]n employee shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs CFRA leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. The employee need not expressly assert rights under CFRA or FMLA, or even mention CFRA or FMLA, to meet the notice requirement; however, the employee must state the reason the leave is needed, such as, for example, the expected birth of a child or for medical treatment.
Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11091.
Second, an employer "shall respond to the leave request as soon as practicable and in any event no later than five business days after receiving the employee's request." Id.
Here, the parties dispute whether Plaintiff's statements to Corona and Salguero adequately notified Defendants that Plaintiff needed to take a CFRA leave. Plaintiff did inform Defendants that he was in the hospital and needed time [*19]  off work because of his illness. (NOL Ex. E at 300:6-301:12, 308:15-310:25, 316:11-319:25; Leidenheimer Decl. ¶ 12.) Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff did provide notice of Plaintiff's medical condition. (NOL Ex. C at 124:4-23.) However, Defendants allege that Plaintiff was offered but declined a leave and voluntarily quit. (Id. at 115:9-25, 135:4-24.)
The parties agree that no written notice was provided to Plaintiff regarding his eligibility before his termination. Defendants allege that Corona verbally informed Plaintiff of his eligibility over the phone. (Id. at 115:15-20.) After Plaintiff's termination, Defendants mailed a letter to Plaintiff confirming that Plaintiff declined to take his CFRA leave. (NOL Ex. R.) Plaintiff alleges he did not receive this letter. (Pico Decl. Ex. 1 at 332:13-24.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants did not tell him he was eligible for leave. (Leidenheimer Decl. ¶ 21; Pico Decl. Ex. 1 at 72:5-74:9.)
Again, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Plaintiff's statements to Corona and Salguero adequately notified Defendants that Plaintiff needed to take a CFRA leave and whether Defendant actually informed Plaintiff of his right to [*20]  leave.

2. Retaliation
Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot prove that Plaintiff was terminated because he exercised his right to CFRA leave. (Defs. Mot. Summ. J. at 23.) Defendants argue that the only evidence showing a causal link between Plaintiff's alleged request for leave and his discharge is temporal proximity, which is insufficient at summary judgment. (Id. at 23-24.) Therefore, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of retaliation. (Id. at 23.)
Plaintiff claims Defendants retaliated against him because he was eligible for leave and attempted to exercise his right to leave. (Pl. Opp'n at 20.) Further, Plaintiff argues that Defendants' pretextual charge that he voluntarily quit is undermined by the temporal proximity between his request for leave and his termination. (Id.) Plaintiff also points to statements allegedly made by Defendants' managers shortly after Plaintiff's termination regarding getting rid of Plaintiff because Plaintiff was sick. (Decl. Rafael Arreola ¶ 4; Decl. Hector Santiago ¶ 4.)
Under the CFRA it is unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual because the individual exercised their right to family care and medical leave [*21]  provided by the statute in subdivision (a). Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(l)(1).
Retaliation in violation of the CFRA follows a burden-shifting analysis similar to the McDonnell Douglas framework for proving discrimination claims. Faust v. California Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 885, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007). The burden shifting requires first for the plaintiff to make a prima facie case of discrimination, second for the employer to rebut the presumption of discrimination with evidence of the employer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action, and third for the plaintiff to offer evidence of discriminatory motive and attack the employer's reason as pretextual. See Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal.4th 317, 354-56, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000); see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).
To establish a prima facie claim of retaliation in violation of the CFRA, plaintiff must show: "(1) the defendant was an employer covered by CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised [his] right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, fine, or suspension, because of [his] exercise of [his] right to CFRA leave." Faust, 150 Cal. App. 4th at 885 (citations omitted).
Here, Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of retaliation. As discussed above, Plaintiff argues that he sufficiently notified Defendants of his need to take [*22]  CFRA leave by informing both Salguero and Corona of his medical condition. Defendants allege that Plaintiff refused the offered CFRA leave and voluntarily quit. Plaintiff alleges that he asked to use his disability benefits and received termination paperwork shortly thereafter. Thus, there is a genuine dispute of fact regarding whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action sufficient to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.

B. Discrimination Claims Under FEHA
Plaintiff has three claims for discrimination under FEHA: race, disability, and age. (FAC at 16-17, 21-26.)
FEHA prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of age, race, and disability, as well as other forms of discrimination, in statutory language that is similar to federal employment laws. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12904(a); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 354 (2000). Because of this similarity, California courts have adopted the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting test for discrimination claims based on disparate treatment. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 354.
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, "[g]enerally, the plaintiff must provide evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an [*23]  adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive." Id. at 355.
Here, Plaintiff has made a prima facie case for discrimination on the basis of race, age, and disability. Because Plaintiff's theory and evidence for these three discrete bases of discrimination are intertwined, the claims will be discussed together.
Plaintiff is a member of protected classes as a Caucasian, sixty-three year old man with a disability that resulted in a hospital stay. (FAC ¶ 12; NOL Ex. E at 80:17-22.) Plaintiff performed well at work, as evidenced by his customer service awards. (Pico Decl. Ex. 2.) And then after Plaintiff entered the hospital, and after several alleged remarks regarding Plaintiff's race and age, Plaintiff was either fired or quit. (Leidenheimer Decl. ¶ 17, 19-20, 24.)
Defendants argue that there is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action: Plaintiff voluntarily resigned. (Defs. Mot. Summ. J. at 9-11.) But this exact point about resignation versus termination is the most disputed part of this case. (See, e.g., id. At 5, 10; Defs. Reply to Pl. Opp'n to Statement of Uncontroverted [*24]  Facts at No. 9.)
Defendants also argue that the stray remarks Plaintiff raises to show discrimination are insufficient, out of context, and inadmissible. (Defs. Mot. Summ. J. at 11-17; Defs. Reply at 2-10.) Defendants are incorrect on these points. Plaintiff's evidence of what he alleges his managers said about his age, race, and disability are admissible as party admissions. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D). Further, "stray remarks" like the ones alleged here are sufficient to pass summary judgment as they are numerous, supported by admissible evidence, and are temporally consistent with discrimination. See Reid v. Google, Inc., 50 Cal.4th 512, 538-45, 113 Cal. Rptr. 3d 327, 235 P.3d 988 (2010).
Further, Plaintiff has produced evidence to demonstrate that he never voluntarily resigned, as discussed above. Also, Plaintiff has evidence of statements made by Defendants' agents regarding Plaintiff's age, race, and disability, which shows that Defendants' proferred reason for the adverse employment action could be pretextual. (See, e.g., Arreola Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6; NOL at Ex. E 183:17-20, 361:14-364:10, 362:6-19; Decl. Hector Santiago ¶ 4.)
But the real problem is that there is a material factual dispute here — what happened during the phone call regarding Plaintiff's termination or resignation. This factual [*25]  dispute cannot be resolved by this Court on summary judgment.

C. Accommodation and Interaction Claims Under FEHA
Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants failed to accommodate his disability and engage in the interactive process required under FEHA for determining those accommodations. (FAC at 17-21.) Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to show that he requested leave or any other accommodation, and that Plaintiff therefore did not initiate any interactive process for Defendants to fail to engage in. (Defs. Mot. Summ. J. at 17-20; Defs. Reply at 12-14.)
Under FEHA, an employer must make reasonable accommodations for the known disability of an employee. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). To determine these reasonable accommodations, the employer must "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations." Id. § 12940(n). The burden to initiate the interactive process is on the employee, "unless the disability and resulting limitations are obvious." Scotch v. Art Institute of Cal.-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). There are no requirements that the employee use "magic words" and the employer's obligation to engage in the interactive process "arises once the employer becomes aware of the need to consider an accommodation." [*26]  Id. (internal quotation omitted).
"The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Id. at 1009-10.
Defendants' arguments here belie why summary judgment is inappropriate in this case: the key argument that Plaintiff did not request and was not denied leave is subject to the same factual dispute as for the rest of the claims. As discussed above, Plaintiff has produced evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment that he did request some kind of a leave accommodation and that this resulted in his termination rather than an interactive process or accommodation.
Defendants' argument that because Plaintiff accepted disability benefits past the twelve-week window for leave, Plaintiff would be unable to perform his work even with reasonable accommodations is unavailing. The length of Plaintiff's disability was not known to Defendants at the time they allegedly failed to accommodate Plaintiff and to engage in an interactive process of determining what that accommodation could be. Further, [*27]  as Plaintiff argues, Plaintiff's request for leave might not have been indefinite and there is evidence that Defendants failed to even engage in a discussion to determine what kind of leave would be appropriate for his then-existing medical needs. Therefore, this claim survives summary judgment as well.

D. Whistle-blower Retaliation Under Labor Code § 1102.5
Section 1102.5 prohibits retaliation against employees who are whistle-blowers: those who disclose information about or who refuse to participate in unlawful activities of the employer. See Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5. "[T]o establish a prima facie case under section 1102.5(c), a plaintiff must offer proof that: (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) the defendant subjected him to adverse employment actions; and (3) that there is a causal link between the two." Tobin v. City & Cnty. Of San Francisco Police Dept., No. 13-cv-01504-MEJ, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54917, 2015 WL 1885632, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2015). The analysis then tracks McDonnell Douglas burden shifting: the employer must show legitimate, nondiscriminatory motive and the plaintiff must rebut that showing with evidence of pretext. See Hallman v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., No. 2:13-cv-02139-ODW (SSx), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139903, 2013 WL 5441753, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 27, 2013).
Here, Plaintiff has offered evidence showing that (1) he engaged in a protected activity by filing a lawsuit against Defendants for wage and hour violations; (2) he was fired; and (3) [*28]  there is a temporal proximity between his firing and the protected activity because he was fired less than a year later and suffered discrimination at work until that time. Defendants argue that the eleven months between the lawsuit filing and the alleged termination is too long to show any causal connection and that Plaintiff's evidence of pretext is insufficient to survive summary judgment. (Defs. Mot. Summ. J. at 24-25; Defs. Reply at 15.)
Plaintiff's evidence is minimal but is sufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment in the context of the rest of his claims. Plaintiff has produced evidence that there was an adverse employment action — that he was fired — and the dispute over whether that actually happened is the kind of material fact dispute that cannot be resolved on summary judgement. Further, Plaintiff has alleged other discrimination against him in the eleven months between his filing the lawsuit and his termination. In sum, this claim survives summary judgment.

E. Wrongful Termination and Declaratory Relief
Both Plaintiff's Wrongful Termination and Declaratory Relief arguments rely on Plaintiff's success in his other claims. (See FAC at 15 (wrongful termination based [*29]  on CFRA claims), 28-31 (declaratory relief based on discrimination and CFRA claims).) Because summary judgment was denied for Plaintiff's claims under the CFRA and FEHA, Plaintiff's wrongful termination and declaratory relief claims also survive summary judgment.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
