FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
YOU, Magistrate Judge:
Plaintiff Lou Colasanti ("plaintiff") brought this action against the City of Portland ("the City") and the State of Oregon ("the State") (collectively "defendants") in Multnomah County Circuit Court, and the City timely removed. See Removal Notice, ECF #1. This court has original jurisdiction over the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3). Against the City, plaintiff alleges claims for employment discrimination and retaliation under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12111-12117 (claims one and two), and O.R.S. Chapter 659A (claim three), Oregon law prohibiting unlawful discrimination against persons with disabilities. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 47-88, ECF #3. Against the State, plaintiff alleges claims [*2]  for discrimination (1) by a public entity1 under Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165 (claim four), (2) under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701-797 (claim five), and (3) by the state government under O.R.S. 659A.142 (claim six). Am. Compl. ¶¶ 89-123, ECF #3.
Defendants have each filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim under F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6). Def.'s Mot. Dismiss ("City's Mot."), ECF #7; Def.'s Mot. Dismiss ("State's Mot."), ECF #12. The City seeks dismissal of plaintiff's retaliation claims, i.e., claim two (ADA) and part of claim three (O.R.S. 659A.109). City's Mot., ECF #7. Further, the City seeks to dismiss the plaintiff's prayer for compensatory damages under the second claim. Id. The State seeks dismissal of all claims against it (claims four, five, and six). State's Mot., ECF #12.
For the reasons that follow, (1) the City's motion to dismiss plaintiff's retaliation claims should be GRANTED, but plaintiff should be granted leave to amend his complaint to allege that he engaged in the protected activity of requesting an accommodation. The City's motion to strike plaintiff's prayer for compensatory and noneconomic damages in the second claim should be GRANTED, as plaintiff concedes that motion. The State's [*3]  motion to dismiss should be GRANTED, but plaintiff should be granted leave to amend his complaint to allege a discrimination in public services claim.

STANDARD
To state a claim for relief, a pleading must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]" F.R.C.P. 8(a)(2). This standard "does not require 'detailed factual allegations,'" but does demand "more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). "A pleading that offers 'labels and conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.'" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).
A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests whether there is a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory. Taylor v. Yee, 780 F. 3d 928, 935 (9th Cir. 2015). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, "a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). In evaluating a motion to dismiss, the court must accept the allegations of material fact as true and construe those allegations in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v. Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995).

BACKGROUND
The Amended Complaint alleges the following facts:
Plaintiff applied for and was hired as a police officer [*4]  by the Portland Police Bureau ("PPB"), subject to successfully completing basic police officer training administered by the State. Am. Compl. ¶ 19, ECF #3. Plaintiff worked for PPB a little over two months, from January 4, 2018, when PPB swore in plaintiff as a police officer, until March 14, 2018, when PPB terminated plaintiff. Id. ¶ 21, 45. Shortly after his swearing in, plaintiff attended a basic police training course coordinated by the Department of Police Standards and Training ("DPSST") at its academy. Id. ¶ 27. The State, through DPSST, certifies officers. Id. ¶ 11.
Plaintiff suffers from Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart condition caused by a combination of heart defects. Id. ¶ 15. Before adulthood, plaintiff had four open-heart surgeries for his condition. Id. ¶ 16. The condition results in oxygen-poor blood, impairing plaintiff's major life activities of running, jumping, pushing, and pulling, in addition to causing plaintiff to become fatigued at a faster rate during exercise and to be fatigued after exercise. Id. ¶ 15.
In 2017, plaintiff applied for a job with the City as a police officer. Id. ¶ 19. He disclosed his heart condition to a doctor at his PPB prehire physical [*5]  medical examination. Id. On November 22, 2017, plaintiff received an offer letter from PPB. Id. ¶ 21. In the weeks that followed plaintiff's January 4, 2018 swearing in, he forwarded his personal health history to PPB's employee health department, disclosed his heart condition in writing as part of his health history prior to seeing a nurse at PPB Training Center, discussed his condition with that nurse, and explained the condition over the telephone to a doctor inquiring about plaintiff's suitability to wear a gas mask in connection with his duties as a police officer. Id. ¶¶ 22, 24-25.
On January 16, 2018, plaintiff spoke with his supervisor, PPB Sergeant William Goff, who was the DPSST liaison and would later be plaintiff's direct supervisor at the DPSST academy, about his heart condition, thereby "disclosing his disability and requesting accommodations." Id. ¶ 23. Plaintiff told Sergeant Goff about his heart condition, expressing to Sergeant Goff that he was worried he would receive bad reviews if his heart caused him to fatigue during evaluations. Id. In response, Sergeant Goff said, "Keep this to yourself. It is likely no one else will need to know about this. It probably will [*6]  not be an issue." Id.
On January 21, 2018, plaintiff entered the DPSST Academy. Id. ¶ 27. During his first week there, plaintiff took and failed the Oregon Physical Abilities Test (ORPAT or pre-ORPAT), a timed obstacle-style course.2 Id. As a result of pushing himself to complete the test, plaintiff became fatigued, had trouble breathing, became faint, and tasted blood in his mouth. Id. Plaintiff told the DPPST instructor and evaluator that he had trouble breathing during the test and tasted blood in his mouth, and the instructor replied it "was normal to taste blood" during the test. Id. That night, plaintiff was physically ill in bed and was coughing. Id.
On January 24, 2018, plaintiff submitted a "Goal Assignment" from his personal email account to DPSST Instructor Lieutenant Donald Sedlacek. Id. ¶ 28. Plaintiff alleges that, in the email, he notified Lieutenant Sedlacek of his disability and "requested an accommodation," stating that "due to my serious health condition[,] . . . I can fatigue at a fast rate," meaning that his heart condition results in his fatiguing more quickly than others when engaging in high intensity drills. Id.
On January 25, 2018, plaintiff spoke with Sergeant [*7]  Goff about his heart condition, its history, and his score on the pre-ORPAT. Id. ¶ 30. At first, Sergeant Goff said he would let all of plaintiff's instructors know about his heart condition. Id. Then Sergeant Goff said, "On second thought, you should talk to your instructors yourself about your heart. I don't want to get involved 'for legal reasons.'" Id. Plaintiff told Sergeant Goff that he was not sure if he could ever pass the ORPAT, as it was not an issue of effort or training, but due to limitations related to his heart condition. Id. Sergeant Goff advised plaintiff to tell his instructors about his condition and train harder and said that he did not want plaintiff to mention his heart condition again. Id.
On January 26, 2018, plaintiff disclosed his heart condition to Lieutenant Sedlacek. Id. ¶ 32. Plaintiff asked Lieutenant Sedlacek which staff members needed to know about plaintiff's condition. Id. Lieutenant Sedlacek told plaintiff that he did not need to go around telling anyone else about the details of his heart condition and should keep his heart condition to himself because some people in the past had used health conditions as an "excuse." Id. This made plaintiff feel [*8]  diminished for having a disability and requesting accommodation. Id.
Between January 26, 2018, and March 4, 2018, plaintiff put immense pressure on himself to train harder to meet the ORPAT goals. Id. ¶ 33. Plaintiff worked out in his free time, increasing his physical index score by fifteen points. Id. Plaintiff gradually worked himself into a dangerous state of exhaustion, largely due to "a lack of physical accommodations provided by PPB and DPSST; numerous failed attempts for a meaningful dialogue; and instructors telling [him] to keep quiet about his disability." Id. ¶ 35.
On March 5, 2018, the date of his written midterm examination, plaintiff felt extremely fatigued and ill. Id. ¶ 37. Plaintiff did not pass the exam, scoring a 74.38% instead of a 75% passing score.3 Id. Lieutenant Sedlacek then dismissed plaintiff from the Academy.4 Id. Plaintiff explained to Lieutenant Sedlacek that he had not performed well on the written exam due to his efforts to improve his physical performance on the ORPAT. Id.
On March 6, 2018, plaintiff reported to PPB Lieutenant Peter Mahuna at PPB headquarters. Id. ¶ 39. Plaintiff explained that he was dismissed from the Academy [*9]  because he had underperformed on the midterm exam due to fatigue from trying to train past his heart condition. Id. Plaintiff asked Lieutenant Mahuna for the accommodation of being allowed to complete his probationary period with PPB. Id. Plaintiff also asked Lieutenant Mahuna if PPB had ever provided an accommodation to a recruit attending the DPSST Academy. Id. Lieutenant Mahuna volunteered that PPB had modified physical testing in the past.5 Id. Lieutenant Mahuna asserted that PPB "never knew" about plaintiff's heart condition and that his dismissal was final. Id.
Plaintiff's dismissal letter from the Academy instructed him to contact DPSST Academy Manager Michael Herb to request an appeal. Id. ¶ 38. On March 6, 2018, plaintiff left a voicemail for Manager Herb requesting an appeal. Id. ¶ 40. On March 7, 2018, plaintiff sent an email to Manager Herb (copying Sergeant Goff and DPSST Director Erik Gabliks) requesting an appeal. Id. ¶ 41. Manager Herb did not respond to plaintiff's voicemail or email. Id. On March 8, 2018, plaintiff received an email from Director Gabliks (copying DPPST Trainer Mike Leloff, Sergeant Goff, and Manager Herb) denying plaintiff's appeal. Id.
On March 8, 2018, [*10]  plaintiff submitted a second appeal to Director Gabliks, Sergeant Goff, Manager Herb, and Trainer Leloff. Id. ¶ 42. Plaintiff specifically asked to be allowed to retake the midterm exam as a "reasonable accommodation" under both Titles I and II of the ADA. Id. Director Gabliks responded by email the same day and stated he would look into the matter, but did not specify a response date or potential course of action. Id.
On the evening of Thursday, March 8, 2018, plaintiff submitted a third appeal to Director Gabliks, Sergeant Goff, Manager Herb, Trainer Leloff, and PPB Sergeant Christopher Gjovik. Id. ¶ 43. In this appeal, plaintiff provided further information about his heart-related health symptoms and circumstances surrounding the test as reasons for deserving an in-person appeal. Id.
On March 14, 2018, Sergeant Gjovik delivered a letter signed by PPB Chief Danielle Outlaw firing plaintiff for failing "to meet academic and physical standards." Id. ¶ 45. After plaintiff was terminated, he received an email from Director Gabliks stating that the DPSST had "no record" of plaintiff "asking for accommodations," and thus DPSST considered his appeal closed. Id. ¶ 46.

FINDINGS

I. City's Motion [*11]  to Dismiss Second Claim for Retaliation and Part of Third Claim Alleging Retaliation (ADA Title I and O.R.S. 659A.109)
In his second and third claims, plaintiff alleges that the City retaliated against him by terminating him for pursuing an ADA protected activity, i.e., requesting accommodation for his disability, without engaging in an interactive process. Am. Compl. ¶ 62, 76.
The City contends that these claims fail on two grounds. City's Mot. 1, ECF #7. First, the City asserts that plaintiff has not adequately alleged a protected activity because he has not pleaded that he requested a timely and specific accommodation. Id. at 8-14. Second, the City asserts that plaintiff has failed to allege a causal connection between the protected activity (requesting an accommodation for his disability) and the adverse employment action (his termination). Id. at 14-16. For the reasons discussed below, the City's first argument is well taken, but the second is not.

A. Relevant Law

1. ADA Retaliation
Under Title I of the ADA, it is unlawful to "discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated [*12]  in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203.
In evaluating claims of retaliation under the ADA, the Ninth Circuit applies the burden-shifting analysis set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1186 (9th Cir. 2003). To state a prima facie claim of retaliation under the ADA, the plaintiff must show: "(1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link between the two." Pardi v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 389 F.3d 840, 849 (9th Cir. 2004).6

2. State Law Retaliation
Oregon law is similar and provides: "It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual with respect to hire or tenure or any term or condition of employment because the individual has applied for benefits or invoked or used the procedures provided for in ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145 or has given testimony under the provisions of ORS 659A.103 to 659A.145." O.R.S. 659A.109. The standard for establishing a prima facie case under the Oregon disability statutes is the same as under the analogous ADA provision. See Wheeler v. Marathon Printing, Inc., 157 Or. App. 290, 301 n.6, 974 P.2d 207 (1998) (noting that the Oregon statutory scheme regarding workplace discrimination against disabled persons "contain[s] language significantly similar to the ADA"); see also O.R.S. 659A.139 ("ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139 shall be construed to the extent possible in a manner that is consistent with any similar provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities [*13]  Act of 1990, as amended.").

B. Analysis

1. Protected Activity
Making a request for an accommodation is a protected activity. See Coons v. Secretary of U.S. Dept. of Treasury, 383 F.3d 879, 887 (9th Cir. 2004). Such a request "does not need to be phrased in terms of 'demand for accommodation.'" Roloff v. SAP Am., Inc., 432 F. Supp. 2d 1111, 1119 (D. Or. 2006); see also Barnett v. U.S. Air, 228 F.3d 1105, 1112 (9th Cir. 2002) ("An employee requesting a reasonable accommodation should inform the employer of the need for an adjustment due to a medical condition using 'plain English' and need not mention the ADA or use the phrase 'reasonable accommodation.'") (internal quotation omitted). Indeed, the "standard for determining whether an employer has been put on notice that an employee is seeking a reasonable accommodation for the employee's limitations is low." Hayes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 781 F. Supp. 2d 1080, 1090 (D. Or. 2011). An employer is on notice of an employee's accommodation request when the employee "provides the employer with enough information that, under the circumstances, the employer can be fairly said to know of both the disability and desire for an accommodation." Id. (citation omitted). An employer's notice of an employee's disability and desire for accommodation triggers the interactive process. Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1114.
Plaintiff alleges that he "had a running dialogue with Sergeant Goff, and had requested accommodations from Sergeant Goff." Am. Compl. ¶ 39. [*14]  He also alleges that he specifically requested accommodation for his disability on several occasions, including:
(1) On January 16, 2018, plaintiff told Sergeant Goff that he had undergone four heart surgeries for Tetralogy of Fallot and was worried instructors might give him bad reviews should his heart cause him to fatigue during evaluations, "thereby disclosing his disability and requesting accommodations." Id. ¶ 23.
(2) On January 24, 2018, plaintiff communicated to DPSST instructor Lieutenant Sedlacek and "requested an accommodation" related to his disability and his tendency to fatigue when engaging in higher intensity drills. Id. ¶ 28.
(3) On March 6, 2018, plaintiff reported to Lieutenant Mahuna after his dismissal from the Academy. Plaintiff told Lieutenant Mahuna that he had underperformed on the midterm exam due to fatigue from trying to train past his heart condition and specifically "requested the accommodation[] of being allowed to complete his probationary status with PPB." Id. ¶ 39.
(4) On March 8, 2018, before plaintiff was terminated by PPB, he requested the specific accommodation of being allowed to retake the test. Id. ¶ 42.
The Complaint does not allege how plaintiff [*15]  specifically requested an accommodation on January 16 and 24, 2018, other than by disclosing his medical condition. The general rule is that the employee must make a specific initial request for accommodation. Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 246 F.3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1112). An employer's recognition of the need for an accommodation, however, may trigger the interactive process "even if the employee does not specifically make the request." Id. This exception to the general rule only applies "when the employer (1) knows that the employee has a disability, (2) knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability, and (3) knows, or has reason to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, plaintiff fails to allege that he falls under the exception to the general rule. There is no dispute that plaintiff sufficiently alleges that PPB was aware that he had a disability--a heart condition. He disclosed it not only to Sergeant Goff and Lieutenant Mahuna but also, in writing and orally, to many others connected to his city employment, including to a physician at his PPB prehire physical medical examination, [*16]  as part of his personal health history file sent to PPB's employee health department, and to a nurse at PPB's training center. He also alleges that he experienced workplace problems because of his disability--a tendency to fatigue that hampers his ability to perform "high intensity drills" and physical evaluations. Plaintiff does not allege, however, that his disability prevented him from requesting an accommodation, i.e., that his heart condition prevented him from requesting an accommodation for the written midterm exam. Plaintiff's claim, then, falls under the general rule that he needed to make an initial, specific accommodation request. Although he did make two specific requests--to complete his probationary status and to retake the midterm--they were not timely. He made both requests after failing the midterm.
Accordingly, plaintiff has not alleged that he engaged in the protected activity of requesting accommodation.

2. Causation
The City also argues that plaintiff's amended complaint is deficient because it does not sufficiently allege causation between the protected activity (seeking accommodation for his disability) and plaintiff's termination, largely because no specific accommodation [*17]  was requested until after plaintiff's dismissal from the Academy. The adverse employment action complained of, however, is plaintiff's termination by PPB on March 14, 2018, which was after all of his requests for accommodations were made. See supra I.B.1. The City's argument, therefore, is unavailing.
Sufficient causation "may be inferred from circumstantial evidence, such as the employer's knowledge that the plaintiff engaged in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected action and the allegedly retaliatory employment decision." Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987). Causation may be established when the adverse employment action occurred shortly after the protected activity. Alpha Energy Savers, Inc. v. Hansen, 381 F.3d 917, 927 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Coszalter v. City of Salem, 320 F.3d 968, 977-78 (9th Cir. 2003) (a three-month period between a protected activity and retaliatory action "easily" supports an inference of retaliation); Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1065 (9th Cir. 2002) (causation can be inferred from timing alone).
Here, proximity in time is apparent from the complaint. The events, from plaintiff's swearing in as a police officer to his termination, took place just over two months. Plaintiff's causation allegations, therefore, are sufficient to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.

II. The City's Motion to Dismiss Prayers for Compensatory and Noneconomic Damages Under the [*18]  Second Claim
Plaintiff concedes that, under Ninth Circuit law, he cannot recover compensatory or noneconomic damages under an ADA retaliation claim. Pl.'s Resp. City 1, ECF #13. Accordingly, those allegations, as contained in paragraphs 65 and 66 of the Amended Complaint, should be stricken.

III. State's Motion to Dismiss Claims Four, Five, and Six--Discrimination on Basis of Disability by Public Entity (ADA Title II, Rehabilitation Act, and O.R.S. 659A.142)
Plaintiff contends that the State violated Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and O.R.S. 659A.142 when it engaged in discriminatory acts or practices, such as failing to grant accommodations, failing to engage in the interactive process, advising plaintiff not to tell others about his disability, failing to allow plaintiff further testing, dismissing plaintiff from the Academy, and failing to grant plaintiff's appeal. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 94, 118. Plaintiff also alleges that the State's conduct showed deliberate indifference to his rights.7 Id. ¶¶ 95, 108.
The State moves to dismiss plaintiff's discrimination claims, arguing that the allegations do not support the claim that the State, through the DPSST, denied accommodation, deliberate or otherwise, for plaintiff's written [*19]  midterm examination. State's Mot. 5, ECF #12. In support of its motion, the State asserts that plaintiff did not alert DPSST to the need for accommodation, as the State was only aware of plaintiff's physical condition--his heart condition that caused fatigue during heavy exercise--which had no obvious bearing on plaintiff's ability to take a written test. Id. at 5, 6. Further, the state contends that plaintiff's request for accommodation, which came only after he failed the exam, was too late. Id. at 7.
For the reasons that follow, the State's motion should be granted.

A. Relevant Law
1 under Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and O.R.S. 659A.142 all address discrimination against and accommodation of disabled people in services, programs, or activities provided by a public entity.
Title II provides:
Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.
42 U.S.C. § 12132.
Section 504 provides:
No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her [*20]  or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . .
29 U.S.C. § 794(a).
O.R.S. 659A.142(5)(a) provides:
(5)(a) It is an unlawful practice for state government to exclude an individual from participation in or deny an individual the benefits of the services, programs or activities of state government or to make any distinction, discrimination or restriction because the individual has a disability.
Title II and Section 504 include "an affirmative obligation for public entities to make benefits, services, and programs accessible to people with disabilities." Updike v. Multnomah Cnty., 870 F.3d 939, 949 (9th Cir. 2017). Although the Rehabilitation Act requires plaintiffs to plead that the public entity receives federal financial assistance, these statutes are otherwise identical and are analyzed together. Vinson v. Thomas, 288 F.3d 1145, 1152 n.7 (9th Cir. 2002). Additionally, as stated above, the standard for establishing a prima facie case under the Oregon disability statutes is the same as the analogous ADA provision. See supra I.A.2. Thus, the same analysis applies to all three claims.

B. Analysis
A plaintiff bringing suit for failure to accommodate under 1 under Title II of the ADA or Section 504 must show that: (1) the plaintiff is a qualified [*21]  individual with a disability; (2) the plaintiff was denied a reasonable accommodation that the plaintiff needs in order to enjoy meaningful access to the benefits of public services; and (3) the program in question receives federal financial assistance.8 Mark H. v. Hamamoto, 620 F.3d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir. 2010). Where, as here, a disability action seeks monetary relief, a plaintiff must additionally prove a fourth element--intentional discrimination--met by allegations that satisfy the "deliberate indifference" standard. Duvall v. Cty. of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1138-39 (9th Cir. 2001).
A plaintiff sufficiently alleges deliberate indifference by pleading two elements: (1) notice of the need for accommodation, and (2) a failure to act. Id.. A plaintiff can allege notice by pleading that: (1) the plaintiff "alerted the public entity to [the plaintiff's] need for accommodation[,]" (2) "the need for accommodation [was] obvious[,]" or (3) the need for accommodation was "required by statute or regulation." Id. at 1139. Because plaintiff does not allege that the accommodation was required by statute or regulation, the court must determine if he has adequately alleged either that he alerted the State to his need for an accommodation or that the need was obvious.
Plaintiff makes [*22]  many detailed allegations that he incorporates by reference in his claims against the State. See Am. Compl, ¶¶ 89, 104, 114. Plaintiff alleges that the State had notice of his disability and need for accommodation when he told Sergeant Goff, in his DPSST supervisory capacity, and Lieutenant Sedlacek about his heart condition before his dismissal from the Academy. Id. ¶¶ 23, 32. Plaintiff essentially argues that he does not need to plead that he requested an accommodation before taking the written test because the State knew of his need for an accommodation and it deliberately dissuaded him from requesting accommodations for any exams, physical or written. Pl's Resp. State 11-13, 15-16; see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 23, 31, 32, 34.
However, where plaintiff needed an additional accommodation, he was required to alert defendant to that need. See R.Z.C. v. Northshore Sch. Dist., No. 17-35933, 2017 WL 4868845 *17 (W.D. Wash Oct. 27, 2017) ("Critically, nothing in this evidence demonstrates that the Student alerted the District of a need for an additional accommodation[.]"). Plaintiff has failed to allege that he alerted the State to his additional need for accommodation for purposes of taking the written examination. Plaintiff did request to retake the midterm examination after he failed the [*23]  test and after the State had dismissed him from the training academy for failing the test. Am. Compl. ¶ 42. Requesting accommodations after the fact does not weigh into the discrimination determination in a failure to accommodate claim. See Barker v. Yassine, No. 2:11-cv-00246-KJM, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65224, 2013 WL 1907510 *10 (E.D. Cal. May 7, 2013) (explaining that "[i]n order to alert [defendant] to [plaintiff's] disability discrimination and accommodation claims, plaintiff would have to raise some concern" before the event appropriate to the accommodation). The DPSST, then, was under no obligation to allow plaintiff to retake the midterm after he failed it.
As noted, there may be situations where a public entity's duty to look into and provide a reasonable accommodation may be triggered when "the need for accommodation is obvious[,]" i.e., the defendant is constructively on notice of the need. Duvall, 260 F.3d at 1139. On the face of the Amended Complaint, this was not the case. As plaintiff has alleged these claims, his need for accommodations for the written midterm was not obvious because the State only knew about his heart condition and his tendency to fatigue easily during and after physical exercise.
In sum, under 1 under Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the RA, and O.R.S. 659A.142(5)(a), plaintiff must allege that the State was [*24]  on notice that he was requesting an accommodation. Even accepting as true the allegations in the complaint and construing them in favor of the plaintiff, he has failed to do so.

IV. Leave to Amend
Plaintiff has requested leave to amend if the court grants any part of the City or State's motions. Pl.'s Resp. City 16, ECF #13; Pl.'s Resp. State 18, ECF #16. Under F.R.C.P. 15(a)(2), "[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires." "Although the rule should be interpreted with 'extreme liberality,' leave to amend should not be granted automatically." Jackson v. Bank of Hawaii, 902 F.2d 1385, 1387 (9th Cir. 1990) (quoting United States v. Webb, 655 F.2d 977, 979 (9th Cir. 1981)). Whether to grant leave to amend lies within the sound discretion of the court. Webb, 655 F.2d at 979. "In exercising this discretion, a court must be guided by the underlying purpose of Rule 15 to facilitate decision on the merits, rather than on the pleadings or technicalities." Id.
The court "may exercise its discretion to deny leave to amend due to 'undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party. . . , [and] futility of amendment.'" Carvalho v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC, 629 F.3d 876, 892-93 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962)).
This case is in the early stage of litigation and there is no evidence of undue delay, bad [*25]  faith, or dilatory motive by plaintiff, or prejudice to defendants. No other amendments have been previously allowed, and there is no indication that amendment would be futile. Accordingly, plaintiff should be allowed to amend the complaint.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The City's motion to dismiss (ECF #7) should be GRANTED regarding plaintiff's retaliation claims, but he should be given leave to amend his complaint to allege that he engaged in the protected activity of requesting an accommodation. The City's motion to dismiss (ECF #7) should GRANTED regarding plaintiff's prayer for compensatory and noneconomic damages, which should be stricken. The State's motion to dismiss (ECF #12) also should be GRANTED, and plaintiff should be given leave to amend his complaint to allege a discrimination in public services claim.
