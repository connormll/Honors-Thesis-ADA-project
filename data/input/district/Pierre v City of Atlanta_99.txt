Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Pascale Pierre filed the above-styled employment discrimination action against Defendant City of Atlanta on December 22, 2014. [Doc. 1]. Plaintiff Pierre alleges that Defendant subjected her to retaliation and discrimination on the basis of her disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111, et seq. [Doc. 1, Counts I, II]. Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant discriminated against her based on national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. [Doc. 1, Count III; Docs. 7, 9]. Defendant has moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 on Plaintiff's claims [*2]  based upon the pleadings, statements of material facts, exhibits, and discovery materials submitted to the court. [Doc. 30].

I. Facts
When evaluating the merits of a motion for summary judgment, the court must "view the evidence and all factual inferences raised by it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-moving party." Comer v. City of Palm Bay, Florida, 265 F.3d 1186, 1192 (11th Cir. 2001). However, mere conclusions and unsupported statements by the party opposing summary judgment are insufficient to avoid summary judgment. See Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005). Therefore, the evidence presented by the parties having been evaluated in accordance with the foregoing principles, the following facts are deemed to be true for the limited purpose of evaluating Defendant's motion [Doc. 30] for summary judgment.1
Defendant City of Atlanta hires prospective police officers as police recruits. [Defendant's Statement of Material Facts ("DSMF") ¶ 1]. In 2011, Plaintiff Pascale Pierre, who is a Haitian-American, applied to become a police officer with the Atlanta Police Department. [Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts ("PSMF") ¶¶ 1, 4; Plaintiff's Affidavit ("Pla. Aff.") ¶ 3]. Plaintiff was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2002. [PSMF ¶ 2; Pla. Aff. ¶ 2]. This condition requires Plaintiff to receive Remicade infusion therapy every eight weeks to manage her symptoms. [PSMF ¶ 3; Pla. Aff. ¶ 2]. Before Plaintiff was accepted into the Atlanta Police Department as a police recruit, the City of Atlanta required her to obtain clearance from her physician with respect to her Crohn's disease. [PSMF ¶ 5; Pla. Aff. ¶ 3]. The physician's clearance was received by the City in September 2011, reviewed by Major Jeffrey Glazier, and approved. [PSMF ¶ 6; Pla. [*4]  Aff. ¶ 4; Plaintiff's Deposition ("Pla. Dep.") at 169, Exhibit ("Ex.") H].
In October 2011, Plaintiff was hired as a police recruit by the Atlanta Police Department. [PSMF ¶ 7]. Plaintiff initially served in an administrative assignment within the Homicide Department. [DSMF ¶ 22]. Plaintiff's daily tasks included primarily administrative duties, such as typing, translating, checking-in Atlanta Police Department visitors, and filing. [PSMF ¶ 9; DSMF ¶ 22; Pla. Aff. ¶ 5; Pla. Dep. at 39-40]. Plaintiff was also tasked with non-administrative duties such as driving superiors to functions, canvassing neighborhoods, and shadowing superiors. [PSMF ¶ 10; Pla. Aff. ¶ 5; Pla. Dep. at 39-40].
The City assigns police recruits to Administrative Sergeants. [DSMF ¶ 14]. Administrative Sergeants enter the time for police recruits, conduct the introductory phase for police recruits, conduct physical training tests, and supervise assigned police recruits. [DSMF ¶ 15]. During Plaintiff's employment, Sergeant Craig Condon, Sergeant Andrew Cerul, and Sergeant John Quigley all served as Plaintiff's Administrative Sergeant and supervisor. [DSMF ¶ 19].
Police recruits must earn entry into the Police Academy [*5]  ("the Academy"). [DSMF ¶ 2]. Before achieving entry into the Academy, recruits must pass an official physical training test ("PT test"). [DSMF ¶¶ 3, 4]. Unofficial and practice PT tests do not constitute an official PT test. [DSMF ¶ 5]. After passing an official PT test, police recruits become eligible to enter the next available Academy class. [DSMF ¶ 17]. Sergeant Craig Condon testified that if a police recruit did not pass an official PT test by the fourth attempt, he or she was subject to dismissal. [Condon Dep. at 32-33]. Condon also testified that recruits were "usually told" about this requirement "before the fourth PT test." [Id. at 33]. The PT test consists of two parts, a timed mile and a half run ("1.5 mile run") and an obstacle course. [DSMF ¶ 8; PSMF ¶ 23]. On the day of an official PT test, police recruits complete the 1.5 mile run before attempting the obstacle course. [DSMF ¶ 9]. The Basic Law Enforcement Training Manual for the Atlanta Police Academy ("Training Manual"), which was given to Plaintiff at the beginning of her employment, outlines, inter alia, the requirements for the PT test. [PSMF ¶ 8; Condon Dep. at 14-16, Doc. 32-1, Ex. A]. The Training Manual states: "In order [*6]  to be considered for the next available recruit class, a recruit must have completed the 1.5 mile run in 15:30 [fifteen minutes and thirty seconds] or better and the obstacle course in 2:10 [two minutes and ten seconds] or better." [Id.]. However, Sergeant Condon testified, "The requirement when I was there was 14:30 and two minutes." [Condon Dep. at 16].
Police recruits perform drills, conditioning, inspections, and private training to prepare for the PT test. [DSMF ¶ 12]. If a recruit does not pass both parts of a PT test, he or she is ordered to participate in remedial physical training ("remedial PT"). [DSMF ¶ 11]. Remedial PT consists of activities such as running, push-ups, pull-ups, and running the obstacle course. [DSMF ¶ 13; PSMF ¶ 20; Condon Dep. at 19; Pla. Dep. at 122]. Recruits participate in remedial PT three mornings a week until they earn admission into the Academy. [PSMF ¶ 19; Condon Dep. at 19; Pla. Dep. at 36].
In early 2012, Plaintiff took her first and second official PT tests and failed both of them. [DSMF ¶¶ 25, 26; PSMF ¶ 27]. Some of Plaintiff's remedial PT sessions were supervised by Sergeant Condon, who became Plaintiff's Administrative Sergeant and supervisor [*7]  sometime after Plaintiff's second official PT test. [PSMF ¶ 21; DSMF ¶ 20]. In March 2012, Plaintiff injured her right wrist while practicing the obstacle course. [PSMF ¶ 28; Pla. Dep. at 87-88, 189, Ex. 6; Pla. Aff. ¶ 11]. Plaintiff visited Georgia Hand, Shoulder & Elbow to have the injury evaluated. [PSMF ¶ 29; Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 11, 12; Pla. Dep. at 87-88, 189, Ex. 6]. Plaintiff was placed on light duty as a result of her injuries and directed by her physician to participate in weekly physical therapy sessions. [PSMF ¶ 30; Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 11, 12; Pla. Dep. at 87-88, 189, Ex. 6]. Plaintiff continued to perform her administrative duties in the Homicide Department but did not engage in remedial PT as per her physician's directive. [PSMF ¶ 31; Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 11, 12; Pla. Dep. at 87-88, 189, Ex. 6].
Plaintiff Pierre was the only recruit of Haitian descent in the Homicide Department. [PSMF ¶ 11; Pla. Dep. at 140]. Plaintiff's ethnicity is easily recognizable, due to her distinguishable accent. [PSMF ¶ 12; Pla. Dep. at 143]. According to Plaintiff, she was subjected to harassment based on her Haitian national origin. Plaintiff testified that while she was employed by the Atlanta Police Department, [*8]  her personnel supervisor, Sergeant Janice Sturdivant, refused to refer to Plaintiff by name and instead only referred to her as "Ms. Haiti." [PSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Aff. ¶ 7; Pla. Dep. at 141]. According to Plaintiff, Sergeant Sturdivant "did, however, refer to all other recruits by their respective names." [Id.]. Plaintiff testified that Sergeant Sturdivant said to her: "[Y]ou people do nothing but run down there in Port-au-Prince, why can't you run the PT course?" [PSMF ¶ 15; Pla. Dep. at 141; Pla. Aff. ¶ 8]. Sergeant Sturdivant also allegedly said that Plaintiff was "going to mix soup with [human] bones," implying that Plaintiff practiced cannibalism. [Id.]. Plaintiff testified that Sturdivant's "comments were usually made in front of other officers and fellow recruits." [Pla. Aff. ¶ 8].
Plaintiff testified that she was subjected to other forms of harassment while working as a recruit for the Atlanta Police Department. Plaintiff testified:
I was bullied and harassed, and the system or the City of Atlanta designed it that way so that people like Sturdivant could get away with it. I found urine on my chair every day. I found like one of her friends started offering me a peach. I said, no, [*9]  thank you. Every morning for the next month I would come in and find that same peach in front of my desk. The next day I have to bring a plastic trash bag from my house to cover—imagine a big place [sic] to cover my chair like this, because it will be filled with urine.
[Pla. Dep. at 178-79]. Plaintiff testified that no other recruit in her department was subjected to this level of harassment. [Pla. Aff. ¶ 9].
Plaintiff, as noted supra, was placed on light duty in March 2012 due to a wrist injury and participated in weekly physical therapy sessions. Plaintiff was released from physical therapy on August 3, 2012. [PSMF ¶ 32; Pla. Aff. ¶ 12]. Around this time, Plaintiff was transferred from the Homicide Department to the Annex-Property Unit ("Annex"). [PSMF ¶ 35; Pla. Aff. ¶ 13; Pla. Dep. at 111]. The primary duties of the Annex required significantly more physical labor than the Homicide Department, as Plaintiff was required to move heavy boxes and bags of evidence. [PSMF ¶ 36; Pla. Aff. ¶ 13; Pla. Dep. at 111]. Upon being released from physical therapy on August 3, 2012, Plaintiff was ordered by Sergeant Condon to resume remedial PT. [PSMF ¶ 33; Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 12, 18]. However, Plaintiff [*10]  did not receive clearance to resume such activity until September 21, 2012. [Id.]. Plaintiff testified: "The order to resume remedial PT was in stark contrast to the treatment that other non-Haitian recruits experienced, such as Jessika Campbell, Nina Daniels, Antoinette Greene and Kawanna Henry. All these recruits were provided an opportunity to completely heal from their injuries prior to resuming remedial PT." [Pla. Aff. ¶ 12]. During remedial PT on September 12, 2012, Plaintiff suffered another injury while jumping hurdles. [PSMF ¶ 45; Pla. Dep. at 123-24; Pla. Aff. ¶ 17]. Although Plaintiff informed Sergeant Condon of her new injury and requested that she be allowed to see a doctor, he denied her request. [PSMF ¶ 49; Pla. Dep. 126; Pla. Aff. ¶ 17].
Plaintiff testified that in September 2012, she passed her third official PT test by completing the 1.5 mile run in 14:46 and the obstacle course in 2:01. [DSMF ¶ 27; PSMF ¶ 38; Pla. Dep. at 86; Pla. Aff. ¶ 14]. As is customary for the Atlanta Police Department, Plaintiff's scores were provided to her verbally at the conclusion of the test. [PSMF ¶ 39; Condon Dep. at 18; Pla. Dep. at 103]. Plaintiff's times satisfied the requirements [*11]  listed in the Training Manual of a time of 15:30 or better for the 1.5 mile run and a time of 2:10 or better for the obstacle course. [PSMF ¶ 8; Condon Dep. at 14-16, Ex. A; Pla. Dep. at 204]. Immediately upon learning that she passed the PT test, Plaintiff called her sister, Deborah Pierre, and informed her of the good news. [PSMF ¶ 41; Pla. Aff. ¶ 14].
Plaintiff also spoke with Sergeant Condon and informed him that upon entering the Academy she would need a slight accommodation to her schedule every eight to ten weeks to allow for her Remicade infusion which is required treatment for her Crohn's disease. [PSMF ¶ 42; Pla. Dep. at 108; Pla. Aff. ¶ 15]. Sergeant Condon informed Plaintiff that he would speak to the instructor about her accommodation request, but he never provided an answer to Plaintiff's request. [PSMF ¶ 43; Pla. Dep. at 108; Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 15, 16]. Weeks after the successful PT test, Plaintiff learned that she would not be admitted to the Academy when she did not receive the documentation that other recruits received containing information relating to admission into the Academy. [PSMF ¶ 44; Pla. Dep. at 115].
On September 24, 2012, Sergeant Condon ordered Plaintiff to come [*12]  to his office and sign a memorandum titled "Notification of Physical Training Qualification" form. [PSMF ¶ 46; Pla. Aff. ¶ 19; Pla. Dep. at 191, Ex. 8]. The memorandum stated that the next PT test was scheduled for October 1, 2012, and that this test would be used to determine Plaintiff's "eligibility to continue with Atlanta Police Department in the Recruit Mandate Training Program." [Pla. Dep. at 191, Ex. 8]. The memorandum also stated that Plaintiff would be "subject to dismissal" if she did "not meet the Pre-Academy Fitness Standard" on the next PT test. [DSMF ¶ 29; Pla. Dep. at 191, Ex. 8]. In addition, the memorandum signed by Plaintiff stated: "According to the current Police Recruit Remedial Training Program during the Pre-Academy Fitness Training you are required to run 1.5 miles in 15 minutes and 30 seconds or less, and successfully negotiate the obstacle course in 2 minutes and 10 seconds or less." [Pla. Dep. at 191, Ex. 8]. Plaintiff testified that the document was described as "paperwork for [Plaintiff's] file." [PSMF ¶ 47; Pla. Aff. ¶ 19].
Plaintiff was instructed to take the PT test on October 1, 2012. [PSMF ¶ 50; Pla. Aff. ¶ 21]. Plaintiff passed the 1.5 mile run that [*13]  day with a time of 14:54, but was ordered off the course by Sergeant Condon and not allowed to attempt the obstacle course. [PSMF ¶ 51; Pla. Aff. ¶ 21; Pla. Dep. at 104]. On the same day, October 1, 2012, Sergeant Condon recommended to Major Jeffrey Glazier that Plaintiff be "separated from the City of Atlanta Police Department due to her failure to meet the physical standards of the Training Academy." [DSMF ¶ 33; Doc. 30-2]. Major Glazier made a recommendation later that day to Deputy Chief Shawn L. Jones and Chief of Police George N. Turner to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Both Deputy Chief Jones and Chief Turner concurred with Major Glazier's recommendation for termination. [DSMF ¶¶ 34, 35; Doc. 30-2].
Approximately one and a half weeks later, on October 10, 2012, Plaintiff decided to pay out of pocket for medical assistance. [PSMF ¶ 52; Pla. Aff. ¶ 22]. Plaintiff was advised that day by Dr. Fox with Resurgents Orthopaedics that she was restricted to "sedentary work only" and forbidden from climbing, bending, stooping, or lifting. [PSMF ¶ 53; Pla. Aff. ¶ 22; Pla. Dep. at 200, Ex. 13]. Plaintiff provided the doctor's instructions to Sergeant Condon. [PSMF ¶ 54; Pla. Aff. ¶ 22]. [*14]  Plaintiff was not transferred from the Annex, despite her physician's instructions restricting her to sedentary work only. [PSMF ¶ 55; Pla. Aff. ¶ 23; Pla. Dep. at 200, Ex. 13].
On October 17, 2012, Angelia Ratliff, a City Human Resources ("HR") Manager, issued a termination request to Deputy Chief Jones and Chief Turner. [DSMF ¶ 36; Doc. 30-2]. The memorandum "request[ed] to terminate Police Recruit Pascale Pierre from the Atlanta Police Department due to 'Failure to Meet Probationary Requirements.'" [Doc. 30-2]. On October 18, 2012, Plaintiff sent an e-mail to HR Manager Ratliff. Plaintiff wrote the following, in pertinent part:
Back in March I pulled a ligament on my wrist and I was out for 5 months. I was cleared to return to PT in August and to do only what I could "tolerate." Upon returning to PT I found that some requirements to pass the PT-test have changed[. T]he running time went from 15:30 to 14:30 and each recruit only had 4 tries at the PT-test or else. It was new to me since I was out for 5 months but I hung in there and tried to get into the October class.
Around mid-September I took a bad fall . . . on the second hurdle while practicing the Obstacle Course. My knees were [*15]  already sore from running at remedial [and] the fall made them worse. I was bruised and scarred but I hoped that it was not another major injury. . . . I was in a lot of pain and discomfort when I was at PT but I did not want people to say that I was not trying, so I kept coming to PT because I wanted to pass so badly. . . . I took the next PT-test and I failed it, I could barely move my legs to run [and] each step was painful.
[DSMF ¶ 38; Pla. Dep. at 200, Ex. 14, Doc. 30-4 at 101-03]. Plaintiff concluded the letter by writing: "I don't want to quit working for the City of Atlanta and my intentions were to become a Police Officer, unfortunately it has come to this so I ask for your help in finding a different position." [Pla. Dep., Ex. 14, Doc. 30-4 at 103].
On November 1, 2012, Plaintiff was terminated from her employment with the City of Atlanta. [PSMF ¶ 56; Pla. Aff. ¶ 25; Doc. 32-1, Ex. C]. Plaintiff's salary, title, and benefits remained the same throughout her employment with the City. [DSMF ¶ 21]. Plaintiff testified:
Jessika Campbell took in excess of seven PT tests, while Kawanna Henry and Antoinette Greene each took and failed more than five official PT tests. None of these [*16]  recruits faced an adverse employment action as a result of their inability to pass an official PT test. Similarly, other recruits were admitted to the Academy without passing an official PT test, including Matthew Stewart and Brian Weber. These individuals were allowed to commute scores from their practice tests to their official tests, if they did not pass an official PT test.
[Pla. Aff. ¶ 20]. Plaintiff represented to the Georgia Workers' Compensation Board that she was entitled to "temporary total disability benefits" due to work accidents that took place on March 9 and September 12, 2012. [DSMF ¶ 40; Pla. Dep., Ex. 2].
Additional facts will be set forth as necessary during discussion of Plaintiff's claims.

II. Summary Judgment Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides, "The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (amended 2010). Rule 56(a) "mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will [*17]  bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552 (1986). The standard for granting summary judgment mirrors the directed verdict standard under Rule 50(a), which requires the court to grant a directed verdict where there can be but one reasonable conclusion. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2511 (1986).
The movant bears the initial burden of asserting the basis of his motion, and that burden is a light one. See Celotex, 106 S. Ct. at 2553. The movant is not required to negate his opponent's claim. See id. Rather, the movant may discharge this burden merely by "'showing' - that is, pointing out to the district court - that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Id. at 2554.
When evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 246 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2001). However, the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356 (1986). Instead, "the nonmoving party must present evidence beyond the pleadings showing that a reasonable jury could find in its favor." Fickling v. United States, 507 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990)).
The court will apply these standards in ruling on Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

III. Discussion
Plaintiff Pascale Pierre alleges that Defendant City of Atlanta [*18]  subjected her to discrimination on the basis of her disability in violation of the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation to her disability and by terminating her employment. [Doc. 1, Count I]. Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant violated the ADA by terminating her employment in retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation. [Doc. 1, Count II]. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant subjected her to a hostile work environment and terminated her employment on the basis of her national origin in violation of Title VII. [Doc. 1, Count III].

A. ADA Failure to Accommodate Claim
The ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (quoting Harding v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F. Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001). Plaintiff asserts [*19]  that Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation to her disability, Crohn's disease. [Doc. 1, Count I].
To establish a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she has a disability as defined in the ADA; (2) she is a "qualified individual," meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, she can perform the essential functions of the job she holds; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability.2 See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007)); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007); Witter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998). The ADA's definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of an individual with a disability.3 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity"). "Thus, an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination [*20]  under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and unless the employer can show undue hardship." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262 (emphasis in original).
Defendant City of Atlanta acknowledges that Plaintiff Pierre is able to establish the first prima facie element because her Crohn's disease constitutes a disability under the ADA. [Doc. 30 at 9]. Defendant, however, argues that Plaintiff is unable to establish the second prima facie element because she does not meet the "qualified individual" requirement. The ADA defines the term "qualified individual" as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that [she] can perform [*21]  the essential functions of [her] job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that [she] can perform the essential functions of [her] job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "Courts consider the employer's judgment regarding whether a function is essential, as well as (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the individual to perform the function, (3) the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of individuals who held the job in the past, and (5) the work experience of individuals currently in similar jobs." Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 Fed. Appx. 924, 927-28 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1257-58). If a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of her job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then she is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case. See Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).
Defendant argues in support of its summary judgment motion that the evidence in the record establishes that Plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" because "she could not perform the essential function of gaining admission into the Police Academy." [Doc. 30 at 9]. According to Defendant, "Plaintiff failed every PT entry test she attempted [*22]  for the opportunity to enter the Police Academy." [Id.]. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's own testimony establishes that she failed to pass any of the official PT tests that she attempted. [Id. at 10]. Defendant also alleges that Plaintiff represented to the Georgia Workers' Compensation Board that she was "totally disabled" beginning March 2012 and that she signed a written notification in September 2012 acknowledging that she would be subject to dismissal if she did not meet the "Pre-Academy Fitness Standard" on the next PT entry test. [Doc. 30 at 10]. The court finds Defendant's arguments on this issue to be unpersuasive.
With regard to Plaintiff's representations to the Georgia Workers' Compensation Board, the evidence reveals that Plaintiff asserted in a stipulation agreement with the Board that as a result of an accident on March 9, 2012, she was "entitled to temporary total disability benefits and medical benefits pursuant to the provisions of the Georgia Workers' Compensation Act." [Pla. Dep. at 183, Ex. 2]. Although the parties have not addressed the issue, the court finds for a number of reasons that the stipulation agreement does not contradict her current assertion that she can [*23]  perform the essential functions of the police recruit job. Nor is Plaintiff judicially estopped from asserting that she is a qualified individual under the ADA based on her representations to the Workers' Compensation Board.
Under the Eleventh Circuit's approach to judicial estoppel, "it must be shown that the allegedly inconsistent pleadings were made under oath in a prior proceeding." Dockery v. North Shore Medical Center, 909 F. Supp. 1550, 1558 (S.D. Fla. 1995). In Dockery, the court explained that a "survey of applicable caselaw in the Eleventh Circuit demonstrates that the use of judicial estoppel has been limited to only those instances where a party attempts to put forward a position clearly inconsistent with that undertaken in prior judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings[,]" not in administrative filings. Id. (citing Chrysler Credit Corp. v. Rebhan, 842 F.2d 1257 (11th Cir. 1988); American Nat'l Bank of Jacksonville v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 710 F.2d 1528 (11th Cir. 1983); Johnson Service Co. v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 485 F.2d 164 (5th Cir. 1973)). Defendant has made no argument that Plaintiff's representation of disability made in the stipulation agreement with the Georgia Workers' Compensation Board was made under oath in a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding. There is also no evidence that the standards of disability under the relevant Workers' Compensation Act are identical to those found in the ADA. "[A] person may be totally and permanently disabled for workers' compensation [*24]  purposes and yet still be able to perform a position's essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation. Courts have recognized this important difference between the ADA definition of 'qualified individual with a disability' and other definitions of 'disability.'" Sumner v. Michelin North America, Inc., 966 F. Supp. 1567, 1575 (M.D. Ala. 1997). Finally, the court notes that Plaintiff Pierre did not assert in the stipulation agreement with the Georgia Workers' Compensation Board that she was permanently disabled. [Pla. Dep. at 183, Ex. 2]. Instead, Plaintiff asserted in the agreement that she was "entitled to temporary total disability benefits" as a result of an accident in March 2012. [Id. (emphasis added)]. "[A] person, totally disabled at one point, may be considered a qualified individual [under the ADA] if the allowance of a leave of absence or possible reassignment would provide them the opportunity to resume working at a later date." Dockery, 909 F. Supp. at 1556. For all these reasons, the court finds that Plaintiff's assertion that she was entitled to temporary disability benefits does not contradict her current claim, or estop her from claiming, that she can perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation.
Defendant also argues that [*25]  Plaintiff's own testimony establishes that she failed to pass any of the official PT tests that she attempted. [Doc. 30 at 10]. In support of this argument, Defendant cites to emails sent by Plaintiff to her workers' compensation attorney and the City's HR Department. [Id.; Pla. Dep. at 200, Ex. 14]. But those emails merely show that Plaintiff believed at one time that the 1.5 mile time requirement had been changed from 15:30 to 14:30 and that the obstacle course time requirement was 2:00. [Pla. Dep. at 200, Ex. 14]. Plaintiff, for example, wrote that when she returned to PT in August 2012 after having been on light duty since March 2012 due to a wrist injury, she "found that some requirements to pass the PT-test have changed[. T]he running time went from 15:30 to 14:30. . . ." [Id.; Pla. Aff. ¶ 12]. It appears from this statement that Plaintiff was informed by an unnamed person that the PT test requirements had been changed while she was on light duty. However, there is no document showing that such a change actually took place.
All of the documents offered by the City of Atlanta indicate that to pass the PT test, a recruit had to complete the 1.5 mile run in 15:30 and the obstacle [*26]  course in 2:10. The Basic Law Enforcement Training Manual for the Atlanta Police Academy, which was given to Plaintiff at the beginning of her employment, states: "In order to be considered for the next available recruit class, a recruit must have completed the 1.5 mile run in 15:30 or better and the obstacle course in 2:10 or better." [PSMF ¶ 8; Condon Dep. at 14-16, Doc. 32-1, Ex. A]. Although Defendant argues that Plaintiff never passed any of the official PT tests, Plaintiff testified that she met the PT requirements when she passed her third official test in September 2012 by completing the 1.5 mile run in 14:46 and the obstacle course in 2:01. [DSMF ¶ 27; PSMF ¶ 38; Pla. Dep. at 86; Pla. Aff. ¶ 14]. Plaintiff was asked and testified to the following:
Q. And how was it communicated to you that you passed the third PT test?
A. I was called up and I was given my scores.
Q. Did anyone tell you that you passed?
A. I was given my passing scores. Recruit Pierre, step up. Your running time was 14:46, your obstacle score was 2:01. Yes, sir. Back in line. Next. And they were reading it off something. . . .
Q. Did anyone tell you that you had passed police recruit training and you would be entered [*27]  into the police academy.
A. They did not tell me that. They just told me my scores, and they told everyone their scores and back in line. They didn't give us a story.
[Pla. Dep. at 103].
On September 24, 2012, a short time after Plaintiff passed her PT test, she was required to sign a memorandum titled "Notification of Physical Training Qualification" form. [PSMF ¶ 46; Pla. Aff. ¶ 19; Pla. Dep. at 191, Ex. 8]. Defendant cites to this document in support of its argument that Plaintiff never passed an official PT test. [Doc. 30 at 10]. But the memorandum directly contradicts Defendant's assertions regarding the PT test requirements. The memorandum signed by Plaintiff stated: "According to the current Police Recruit Remedial Training Program during the Pre-Academy Fitness Training you are required to run 1.5 miles in 15 minutes and 30 seconds or less, and successfully negotiate the obstacle course in 2 minutes and 10 seconds or less." [Pla. Dep. at 191, Ex. 8].
A reasonable jury viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff Pierre could conclude that she passed her third official PT test in September 2012 by completing the 1.5 mile run in 14:46 and negotiating the obstacle [*28]  course in 2:01. Although Defendant argues that Plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" because she "failed every official PT test she ever attempted," the evidence does not support Defendant's argument. [Doc. 30 at 11]. Plaintiff's alleged failure to pass the PT test is the only basis upon which Defendant contends that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of the job. For these reasons, the court finds that Plaintiff is able to establish the "qualified individual" prima facie element.
The third and final element requires Plaintiff to show that she was subjected to disability discrimination by Defendant's failure to reasonably accommodate her disability. See Williamson v. Clarke County Dep't of Human Resources, 834 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1319 (S.D. Ala. 2011) (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). An employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer does not make a reasonable accommodation for the employee, unless "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also Anderson, 379 Fed. Appx. at 927 ("An employer impermissibly discriminates against a qualified individual when the employer does not reasonably accommodate the individual's disability."). A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment [*29]  to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b).
An employer is not required, however, to provide an employee with "'the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible.'" Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 947 (N.D. Ga. 1997)). Furthermore, although the ADA lists types of possible accommodations, the fact that a particular accommodation may be included does not mean that such accommodation is automatically deemed "reasonable" under the statute. See Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998). The accommodation must also be reasonable based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Id.; Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285. "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1259-60. "'In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job.'" Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 (citation omitted).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, [*30]  as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Thus, "[t]he plaintiff bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the employee desires." Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 500 Fed. Appx. 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86). An employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify her limitations and possible accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). But when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "'the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant.'" Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id.; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 Fed. Appx. 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) ("where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In the present case, Plaintiff contends [*31]  that in September 2012, shortly after she passed the PT test requirements, she spoke with Sergeant Craig Condon and informed him that upon entering the Police Academy she would need a slight accommodation to her schedule due to her disability. [PSMF ¶ 42; Pla. Dep. at 108; Pla. Aff. ¶ 15]. Plaintiff testified: "I informed [Condon] that I receive Remicade infusion therapy every eight weeks and will need to either come in late or leave early on the days when I am scheduled for the injection." [Pla. Aff. ¶ 15]. Plaintiff testified that the periodic Remicade infusion therapy is a type of treatment which manages the symptoms of her Crohn's disease. [Pla. Aff. ¶ 2]. Sergeant Condon informed Plaintiff that he would speak to the instructor about her accommodation request. [PSMF ¶ 43; Pla. Dep. at 108; Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 15, 16]. The City of Atlanta, however, did not respond to Plaintiff's request by engaging in an informal, interactive process with Plaintiff to identify her limitations and possible accommodations. Sergeant Condon never provided an answer to Plaintiff's request. [PSMF ¶ 43; Pla. Dep. at 108; Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 15, 16].
The court finds that Plaintiff's request for a slight accommodation [*32]  to her schedule for treatment of her Crohn's disease was reasonable, and Defendant makes no argument to the contrary. However, Defendant correctly notes that Plaintiff's request was for an accommodation after she had entered the Police Academy. As Plaintiff testified, "In preparation for my admission into the Academy, I spoke with Sergeant Craig Condon to inform him that I would need a slight accommodation to my schedule once I am in the Academy." [Pla. Aff. ¶ 15 (emphasis added)]. Plaintiff was never admitted into the Academy. And there is no evidence that she either needed or requested an accommodation to her schedule prior to being in the Academy.
In light of these facts, the court finds that Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to show that she was subjected to disability discrimination. Plaintiff only requested an accommodation to her schedule in anticipation of being admitted into the Academy, but she was never admitted. Instead, she was terminated from her employment.4 Because Plaintiff is unable to show that Defendant denied her request for a reasonable accommodation, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 30] be GRANTED on her ADA [*33]  failure to accommodate claim [Doc. 1, Count I].

B. Termination Claims Based on Disability and National Origin
Plaintiff Pierre claims that Defendant City of Atlanta violated the ADA by terminating her employment on the basis of her disability. [Doc. 1, Count I]. As previously noted, to establish a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she has a disability as defined in the ADA; (2) she is a "qualified individual"; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability.5 See Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256. As discussed supra, Plaintiff is able to satisfy the first two prima facie requirements in support of her disability discrimination claim because she has a disability, Crohn's disease, and is a qualified individual under the ADA. Plaintiff is also able to show that decisionmakers were aware of her disability, which is necessary to assert an ADA disability termination claim. See Williamson, 834 F. Supp. 2d at 1322-23. Sergeant Condon was the supervisor who initially recommended that Plaintiff's employment be terminated. [DSMF ¶ 33; Doc. 30-2]. Plaintiff testified that she told Condon of the Remicade infusion treatment that she received for her Crohn's disease. [Pla. Dep. at 108; [*34]  Pla. Aff. ¶ 15]. Major Jeffrey Glazier, who also took part in the termination decision, was informed of Plaintiff's disability prior to her being accepted into the Atlanta Police Department. The City of Atlanta required Plaintiff to obtain clearance from her physician with respect to her Crohn's disease, and the physician's clearance was reviewed by Major Glazier in September 2011. [PSMF ¶¶ 5, 6; Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 3, 4; Pla. Dep. at 169, Ex. H].6
Although Plaintiff has established that decisionmakers were aware of her disability, she has not identified facts indicating that her Crohn's disease was causally related to Defendant's decision to terminate her employment. [Doc. 32 at 22-24]. There is no evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find that Sergeant Condon or any other employee involved in the termination decision was motivated by discriminatory animus based on disability. As discussed infra, Plaintiff may be able to show that her termination was in retaliation for her accommodation request, but that is a separate ADA claim. Because Plaintiff has not created a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether she was terminated because of her disability, she [*35]  is unable to establish a prima facie case. The undersigned, therefore, RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 30] be GRANTED on Plaintiff's ADA claim of disability-based discrimination in her termination [Doc. 1, Count I].
Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant violated Title VII by terminating her employment on the basis of her national origin. [Doc. 1, Count III]. Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer "to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's . . . national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Plaintiff argues that she has direct evidence of national origin discrimination and, therefore, that summary judgment should be denied on this claim. "'Where the non-movant presents direct evidence that, if believed by the jury, would be sufficient to win at trial, summary judgment is not appropriate even where the movant presents conflicting evidence.'" State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Duckworth, 648 F.3d 1216, 1232 (11th Cir. 2011) (Carnes, J., dissenting) (quoting Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., 93 F.3d 739, 742 (11th Cir. 1996)). "'It is not the court's role to weigh conflicting evidence or to make credibility determinations; the non-movant's evidence is to be accepted for purposes of summary judgment.'" Id. (quoting Mize, 93 F.3d at 742). Direct [*36]  evidence is defined as "'evidence, which if believed, proves [the] existence of [the] fact in issue without inference or presumption. Evidence that only suggests discrimination or that is subject to more than one interpretation does not constitute direct evidence.'" Taylor v. Runyon, 175 F.3d 861, 867 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co., 120 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir. 1997)). Eleventh Circuit precedent establishes that "only the most blatant remarks, whose intent could mean nothing other than to discriminate on the basis of some impermissible factor constitute direct evidence of discrimination." Akouri v. State of Florida Dep't of Transp., 408 F.3d 1338, 1347 (11th Cir. 2005) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). "If the alleged statement suggests, but does not prove, a discriminatory motive, then it is circumstantial evidence." Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1086 (11th Cir. 2004). "In order to constitute direct evidence, the evidence must directly relate in time and subject to the adverse employment action at issue." Jones v. BE&K Engineering Co., 146 Fed. Appx. 356, 358 (11th Cir. 2005).
Plaintiff testified that her personnel supervisor, Sergeant Janice Sturdivant, refused to refer to Plaintiff by name and instead only referred to her as "Ms. Haiti." [PSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Aff. ¶ 7; Pla. Dep. at 141]. According to Plaintiff, Sergeant Sturdivant "did, however, refer to all other recruits by their respective names." [Id.]. Plaintiff testified that Sergeant Sturdivant said to [*37]  her: "[Y]ou people do nothing but run down there in Port-au-Prince, why can't you run the PT course?" [PSMF ¶ 15; Pla. Dep. at 141; Pla. Aff. ¶ 8]. Sergeant Sturdivant also allegedly said that Plaintiff was "going to mix soup with [human] bones," implying that Plaintiff practiced cannibalism. [Id.]. Plaintiff contends that Sturdivant's remarks constitute direct evidence that she was terminated on the basis of her national origin. [Doc. 32 at 5-6]. The court disagrees.
"[S]tatements of discriminatory intent must be made by a person involved in the challenged decision to constitute direct evidence of discrimination." Hampton v. City of South Miami, 186 Fed. Appx. 967, 970 n.3 (11th Cir. 2006). "'[R]emarks by non-decisionmakers or remarks unrelated to the decisionmaking process itself are not direct evidence of discrimination.'" East v. Clayton County, Georgia, 436 Fed. Appx. 904, 910 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Standard v. A.B.E.L. Services, Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir. 1998)). Sergeant Sturdivant's alleged remarks do not satisfy the criteria necessary to be considered direct evidence. Defendant City of Atlanta correctly notes that there is no evidence that Sergeant Sturdivant was a decisionmaker or involved in any way in the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment. [Doc. 35 at 1-2]. Furthermore, Plaintiff does not allege that Sturdivant's allegedly discriminatory comments were related to the [*38]  termination decision. Based on these facts, the court finds that Plaintiff is unable to point to direct evidence in support of her discriminatory termination claim.
Because Plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence in support of her Title VII national origin discrimination claim, the court will use the framework articulated in McDonnell Douglas, 93 S. Ct. at 1824-25, to evaluate her claim. Under this framework, the allocation of burdens and order of presentation and proof are as follows: (1) the plaintiff has the burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden (of production) shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action taken against the employee; and (3) should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must have an opportunity to prove that the legitimate reason offered by defendant was a pretext for discrimination. See id. A plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge based on national origin by showing that: (1) she is a member of a protected class, (2) she was qualified for the job, (3) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) a similarly situated [*39]  individual outside her protected class was treated more favorably.7 See Aristyld v. City of Lauderhill, 543 Fed. Appx. 905, 907 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997)). Plaintiff is able to establish the first three elements of her national origin claim because she is Haitian and was terminated from her employment on November 1, 2012, despite being qualified for the position. [PSMF ¶¶ 1, 56]. Defendant makes no argument to the contrary. [Doc. 30 at 20-22].
With regard to the final prima facie element, the Eleventh Circuit has held, "The comparator must be nearly identical to the plaintiff to prevent courts from second-guessing a reasonable decision by the employer." Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1091 (citing Silvera v. Orange County School Bd., 244 F.3d 1253, 1259 (11th Cir. 2001)). The "'quantity and quality of the comparator's misconduct'" must also be nearly identical. Burke-Fowler v. Orange County, Florida, 447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Maniccia v. Brown, 171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 1999)). Thus, to establish this element of the prima facie case, Plaintiff must produce evidence that would permit a jury to conclude that Defendant treated more favorably non-Haitian police recruits who had similar performance deficiencies. The court finds that Plaintiff has carried this burden of production.
Plaintiff alleges that several non-Haitian recruits were similarly situated but were treated far better than Plaintiff. [Doc. 32 at 11]. In early 2012, Plaintiff took her first and second official [*40]  PT tests and failed both of them. [DSMF ¶¶ 25, 26; PSMF ¶ 27]. Plaintiff testified that in September 2012, she passed her third official PT test by completing the 1.5 mile run in 14:46 and the obstacle course in 2:01. [DSMF ¶ 27; PSMF ¶ 38; Pla. Dep. at 86; Pla. Aff. ¶ 14]. Nevertheless, according to Plaintiff, she was instructed to take the PT test on October 1, 2012. [PSMF ¶ 50; Pla. Aff. ¶ 21]. Plaintiff passed the 1.5 mile run that day with a time of 14:54, but was ordered off the course by Sergeant Condon and not allowed to attempt the obstacle course. [PSMF ¶ 51; Pla. Aff. ¶ 21; Pla. Dep. at 104]. On the same day, October 1, 2012, Sergeant Condon recommended that Plaintiff be "separated from the City of Atlanta Police Department due to her failure to meet the physical standards of the Training Academy." [DSMF ¶ 33; Doc. 30-2]. Plaintiff, however, has identified a number of other police recruits who failed more official PT tests than did Plaintiff but were not terminated from their positions or were granted admission into the Police Academy. Plaintiff testified:
Jessika Campbell took in excess of seven PT tests, while Kawanna Henry and Antoinette Greene each took and failed more [*41]  than five official PT tests. None of these recruits faced an adverse employment action as a result of their inability to pass an official PT test. Similarly, other recruits were admitted to the Academy without passing an official PT test, including Matthew Stewart and Brian Weber. These individuals were allowed to commute scores from their practice tests to their official tests, if they did not pass an official PT test.
[Pla. Aff. ¶ 20].
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish the final prima facie element because she has "fail[ed] to identify a similarly-situated comparator with the same supervisor or decision-maker." [Doc. 30 at 21]. The court finds this argument unpersuasive. Although in some situations employees with different supervisors may not be considered similarly situated, such is not the case here because all police recruits were subject to the same policies. As the Eleventh Circuit has explained, "The relevant inquiry is . . . whether the employer subjected them to different employment policies." Lathem v. Dep't of Children and Youth Servs., 172 F.3d 786, 793 (11th Cir. 1999) (citing Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Communications, 738 F.2d 1181, 1186 (11th Cir. 1984)).
Plaintiff was terminated for allegedly failing "to meet the physical standards of the Training Academy," but she has offered evidence that she passed her third [*42]  official PT test after failing the first two. [DSMF ¶¶ 25-27, 33; PSMF ¶¶ 27, 38; Pla. Dep. at 86; Pla. Aff. ¶ 14; Doc. 30-2]. Plaintiff testified that in contrast to her actions in passing an official PT test on her third attempt, Jessika Campbell, Kawanna Henry, and Antoinette Greene were not subjected to any adverse employment actions despite the fact that each failed to pass an official PT test after more than five attempts. In addition, Plaintiff testified that recruits Matthew Stewart and Brian Weber were admitted to the Academy without passing an official PT test. They were allowed to transfer scores from their practice tests to their official tests. [Pla. Aff. ¶ 20]. Given this evidence, even if Defendant were able to show that Plaintiff failed to pass an official PT test, the court would find that the rule was applied in a discriminatory manner when Plaintiff was terminated. See Nix, 738 F.2d at 1186 ("When an individual proves that he was fired but one outside his class was retained although both violated the same work rule, this raises an inference that the rule was discriminatorily applied . . . .").
A reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant treated more favorably non-Haitian police recruits [*43]  who had performance deficiencies similar to and even more severe than those of Plaintiff. Because the evidence in the record would permit a finding that Defendant applied the PT test requirement in a discriminatory manner, Plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge based on national origin. Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, the burden of production then shifts to Defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action taken against Plaintiff. See Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F. 3d 1519, 1528 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing McDonnell Douglas, 93 S. Ct. at 1824; Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1094 (1981)). "'[T]o satisfy this intermediate burden, the employer need only produce admissible evidence which would allow the trier of fact rationally to conclude that the employment decision had not been motivated by discriminatory animus.'" Id. (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1096) (emphasis in original). A "'defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the defendant's evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.'" Id. (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1094). The defendant's burden in the rebuttal stage is "'exceedingly light.'" Walker v. NationsBank of Florida N.A., 53 F.3d 1548, 1556 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting Perryman v. Johnson Products Co., Inc., 698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir. 1983)).
Defendant asserts that it terminated Plaintiff's employment because of her [*44]  "failure to meet the preliminary entry requirement of passing an official PT test to enter the Police Academy." [Doc. 30 at 11]. Defendant claims that Plaintiff was required to complete the obstacle course in 2:00 and the 1.5 mile run in 14:30. [Id. at 9-11]. As discussed supra, Defendant alleges that Plaintiff never satisfied these requirements. Defendant writes, "Plaintiff failed every PT entry test she attempted for the opportunity to enter the Police Academy." [Id. at 9]. The court finds that Defendant has satisfied its light burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment.
Once a defendant meets its burden of production, "the presumption of discrimination created by the McDonnell Douglas framework 'drops from the case,' and 'the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity.'" Combs, 106 F.3d at 1528 (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1094-95 & n.10). The plaintiff then "has the opportunity to demonstrate that the defendant's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is a mere pretext for discrimination." Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1565 (citing McDonnell Douglas, 93 S. Ct. at 1825). "[A] plaintiff may not in all cases merely rest on the laurels of her prima facie case in the face of powerful justification evidence offered by the defendant." Grigsby v. Reynolds Metals Co., 821 F.2d 590, 596 (11th Cir. 1987). Plaintiff's [*45]  demonstration of pretext merges with her "ultimate burden of showing that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff." Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1565 (citing St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2749 (1993)). This task is a highly focused one.
The court "must, in view of all the evidence, determine whether the plaintiff has cast sufficient doubt on the defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer's proffered 'legitimate reasons were not what actually motivated its conduct[.]'" Combs, 106 F.3d at 1538 (quoting Cooper-Houston v. Southern Ry. Co., 37 F.3d 603, 605 (11th Cir. 1994)). Plaintiff "'may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.'" Jackson v. State of Alabama State Tenure Comm'n, 405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1095). In order to establish pretext through the indirect method, the plaintiff "must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." McCann v. Tillman, 526 F.3d 1370, 1375-76 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
Defendant alleges that Plaintiff was terminated because she failed to pass an official PT test which [*46]  was necessary to enter the Police Academy. [Doc. 30 at 9-11]. Plaintiff argues that Defendant's proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for national origin discrimination. In support thereof, Plaintiff contends that the record evidence contradicts Defendant's assertion and shows that Plaintiff passed a PT test on her third attempt. [Doc. 32 at 7-11, 13-14]. The court finds that Plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to cast doubt on Defendant's proffered reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment.
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff never met the PT test requirements of completing the obstacle course in 2:00 and the 1.5 mile run in 14:30. [Doc. 30 at 9-11]. But as discussed in detail supra, all of the documents offered by Defendant City of Atlanta establish that to pass the PT test, a recruit had to complete the 1.5 mile run in 15:30 and the obstacle course in 2:10. The Basic Law Enforcement Training Manual for the Atlanta Police Academy states: "In order to be considered for the next available recruit class, a recruit must have completed the 1.5 mile run in 15:30 or better and the obstacle course in 2:10 or better." [PSMF ¶ 8; Condon Dep. at 14-16, Doc. 32-1, [*47]  Ex. A]. Plaintiff testified that she met these requirements when she passed her third official PT test in September 2012 by completing the 1.5 mile run in 14:46 and the obstacle course in 2:01. [DSMF ¶ 27; PSMF ¶ 38; Pla. Dep. at 86; Pla. Aff. ¶ 14]. A short time later, on September 24, 2012, Plaintiff signed a memorandum titled "Notification of Physical Training Qualification" form. [PSMF ¶ 46; Pla. Aff. ¶ 19; Pla. Dep. at 191, Ex. 8]. Although Defendant cites to this document in support of its argument that Plaintiff never passed an official PT test, the memorandum stated: "According to the current Police Recruit Remedial Training Program during the Pre-Academy Fitness Training you are required to run 1.5 miles in 15 minutes and 30 seconds or less, and successfully negotiate the obstacle course in 2 minutes and 10 seconds or less." [Pla. Dep. at 191, Ex. 8].
The court finds that a reasonable jury could believe Plaintiff's testimony that she passed an official PT test on her third attempt in September 2012, especially in light of the documentation before the court. "[T]his is the classic case of the plaintiff swearing to one set of facts and the defendants swearing to another set of [*48]  facts." Skelly v. Okaloosa County Bd. of County Comm'rs, 415 Fed. Appx. 153, 155 (11th Cir. 2011). "It is not the court's role to weigh conflicting evidence or to make credibility determinations; the non-movant's evidence is to be accepted for purposes of summary judgment." Mize, 93 F.3d 742. Because this is "not a case in which the plaintiff's testimony is so fantastic or internally inconsistent that no reasonable jury could credit it[,]" the court is not permitted to ignore Plaintiff's testimony that she passed an official PT test. Skelly, 415 Fed. Appx. at 155. For these reasons, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiff has demonstrated such inconsistencies and contradictions in Defendant's proffered legitimate reason for firing Plaintiff that a reasonable jury could find it lacking in credibility. See McCann, 526 F.3d at 1375-76. Plaintiff has carried her burden of showing pretext and the court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 30] be DENIED on Plaintiff's Title VII claim that her termination was based on her national origin. [Doc. 1, Count III].

C. ADA Retaliatory Termination Claim
In Count II of her complaint, Plaintiff Pierre asserts a claim for retaliation under the ADA. [Doc. 1, Count II]. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant City of Atlanta terminated her employment in retaliation for her request for a reasonable [*49]  accommodation to her disability in violation of the ADA. [Id.]. The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). The Eleventh Circuit has held that, because this provision creates a prohibition on retaliation under the ADA that is similar to the prohibition on retaliation found in Title VII, courts should evaluate ADA retaliation claims under the same framework used for Title VII retaliation claims. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287; see also McNely v. Ocala Star—Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1075-77 (11th Cir. 1996) (relying on Title VII jurisprudence to interpret meaning of ADA provisions in a retaliation case).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show the same elements generally required for a claim of illegal retaliation under Title VII: (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that there is some causal connection between the expression and the adverse employment action. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. [*50]  "Once a prima facie case is established, the burden then shifts to the defendant employer to come forward with legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for its actions that negate the inference of retaliation." Id. If the defendant meets that burden, the plaintiff must then present evidence demonstrating that the employer's proffered legitimate reasons are merely a "pretextual ruse designed to mask retaliation." Id.
The first prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that she engaged in a protected expression as it is defined under the ADA. This "element may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation." Frazier-White v. Gee,     F.3d    ,    , 2016 WL 1376448, at *7 (11th Cir. April 7, 2016) (citing Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328). Plaintiff is able to satisfy this element. Plaintiff testified that in September 2012, she passed her third official PT test by completing the 1.5 mile run in 14:46 and the obstacle course in 2:01. [DSMF ¶ 27; PSMF ¶ 38; Pla. Dep. at 86; Pla. Aff. ¶ 14]. As is customary for the Atlanta Police Department, Plaintiff's scores were provided to her verbally at the conclusion of the test. [PSMF ¶ 39; Condon Dep. at 18; Pla. Dep. at 103]. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff spoke with Sergeant Craig Condon and informed him that upon entering the Academy she would need a slight [*51]  accommodation to her schedule every eight to ten weeks to allow for her Remicade infusion, which is required treatment for her Crohn's disease. [PSMF ¶ 42; Pla. Dep. at 108; Pla. Aff. ¶ 15]. Sergeant Condon informed Plaintiff that he would speak to the instructor about her accommodation request, but he never provided an answer to Plaintiff's request. [PSMF ¶ 43; Pla. Dep. at 108; Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 15, 16]. Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation to her disability constitutes protected expression under the ADA. See Frazier-White,     F.3d at    , 2016 WL 1376448, at *7.
Plaintiff is also able to establish the second prima facie element of her ADA retaliation claim. Plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action when she was terminated from her employment with the City of Atlanta on November 1, 2012. [PSMF ¶ 56; Pla. Aff. ¶ 25; Doc. 32-1, Ex. C]. Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff's termination rises to the level of an adverse action.
The third and final element of a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA requires Plaintiff to show that there is a causal connection between the protected expression and the adverse employment action. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. This element "requires a showing of but-for causation." Frazier-White,    F.3d at    , 2016 WL 1376448, at *7 (citing University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2533-34 (2013)). If an [*52]  employer takes an adverse employment action against an employee shortly after becoming aware of the employee's protected expression, then the close temporal proximity between the two events is sufficient to meet the "but for" causation requirement. See Adams v. City of Montgomery, 569 Fed. Appx. 769, 773 (11th Cir. 2014); accord Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000). "But mere temporal proximity, without more, must be very close." Adams, 569 Fed. Appx. at 773 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
The court finds that in the present case, Plaintiff is able to establish causation. As noted supra, in September 2012, Plaintiff passed her third official PT test and subsequently informed Sergeant Condon that upon entering the Police Academy she would need an accommodation to her schedule for treatment of her disability. [PSMF ¶¶ 38, 42; Pla. Dep. at 86, 108; Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 14, 15]. Less than a month later, on October 1, 2012, Sergeant Condon recommended to Major Jeffrey Glazier that Plaintiff be terminated from her employment with the City of Atlanta Police Department. [DSMF ¶ 33]. Major Glazier made a recommendation later that day to Deputy Chief Shawn L. Jones and Chief of Police George N. Turner to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Both Deputy Chief Jones and Chief Turner concurred with Major Glazier's recommendation [*53]  for termination. [DSMF ¶¶ 34, 35; Doc. 30-2]. The undersigned concludes that the temporal proximity of less than a month between Plaintiff's accommodation request and Sergeant Condon's recommendation that Plaintiff be terminated is sufficiently close to satisfy the "but for" causation requirement. See Kendall v. Secretary, Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 2016 WL 1665819, at *10 (M.D. Fla. April 27, 2016) ("[B]ecause Kendall requested an accommodation in February of 2009, and was terminated in March of 2009, Kendall has stated a prima facie case of retaliation."); Hubbard v. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 2013 WL 3964908, at *2 (M.D. Ga. July 31, 2013) ("The temporal proximity between Plaintiff's report of sexually offensive conduct on November 12, 2008, and her abrupt termination only three weeks later on December 4, 2008, satisfies the 'very close' standard necessary to establish 'but-for' causation."). Therefore, Plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case of ADA retaliatory termination.
Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, the burden of production shifts to Defendant to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the termination decision. Plaintiff then has the opportunity to show that the proffered reason is pretextual. As discussed supra, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was terminated because she failed to pass an official PT test which was necessary [*54]  to enter the Police Academy. [Doc. 30 at 9-11]. But Plaintiff has offered evidence that she passed her third official PT test and, in so doing, she has demonstrated such inconsistencies and contradictions in Defendant's proffered legitimate reason for the termination decision that a reasonable jury could find it lacking in credibility. See McCann, 526 F.3d at 1375-76. Because Plaintiff has carried her burden of showing pretext, the court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 30] be DENIED on Plaintiff's ADA retaliatory termination claim [Doc. 1, Count II].

D. Hostile Work Environment Claim
In Plaintiff's final claim, she alleges that Defendant subjected her to a hostile work environment based on her national origin in violation of Title VII. [Doc. 1, Count III]. To establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment, Plaintiff must show that (1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based upon a protected characteristic of the employee, in this case, national origin; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and to create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; [*55]  and (5) the defendant is responsible for such environment under either a theory of vicarious or of direct liability. See Walton v. Johnson & Johnson Servs., Inc., 347 F.3d 1272, 1279-80 (11th Cir. 2003). Plaintiff has established the first three elements of the prima facie case because she is Haitian and was subjected to unwelcome comments based on her national origin from her personnel supervisor, Sergeant Janice Sturdivant, and other employees. [PSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Aff. ¶ 7; Pla. Dep. at 141]. Defendant makes no argument to the contrary. Whether the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to affect Plaintiff's terms and conditions of employment is the next issue that must be addressed.
An employer violates Title VII by "creating or condoning an environment at the workplace which significantly and adversely affects an employee because of [her] race or ethnicity, regardless of any other tangible job detriment to the protected employee." Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 901 (11th Cir. 1982). The Eleventh Circuit has held: "To evaluate whether a work environment is objectively hostile, we consider four factors: (1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably [*56]  interferes with the employee's job performance." Adams v. Austal, U.S.A., L.L.C., 754 F.3d 1240, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Fortson v. Carlson, 618 Fed. Appx. 601, 606 (11th Cir. 2015). "In the light of these factors, [courts] ask whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would find the harassing conduct severe or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of the plaintiff's employment." Adams, 754 F.3d at 1251 (citation omitted). "Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII's purview." Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 114 S. Ct. 367, 370 (1993).
In the present case, Plaintiff Pierre was the only recruit of Haitian descent in the Homicide Department. [PSMF ¶ 11; Pla. Dep. at 140]. Because of Plaintiff's distinguishable accent, her ethnicity is easily recognizable. [PSMF ¶ 12; Pla. Dep. at 143]. Plaintiff testified that Sergeant Sturdivant said to her: "[Y]ou people do nothing but run down there in Port-au-Prince, why can't you run the PT course?" [PSMF ¶ 15; Pla. Dep. at 141; Pla. Aff. ¶ 8]. Sergeant Sturdivant also allegedly said that Plaintiff was "going to mix soup with [human] bones," implying that Plaintiff practiced cannibalism. [Id.]. Plaintiff testified [*57]  that Sturdivant's "comments were usually made in front of other officers and fellow recruits." [Pla. Aff. ¶ 8]. Plaintiff also stated that other officers and employees began using similar language. Plaintiff testified: "I feel like some had a little bit of issue with my accent. They were saying, you know, you don't speak—you're not African-American, you're not one of us." [Pla. Dep. at 143]. Plaintiff testified: "It started with Sergeant Sturdivant and a couple of officers that worked in the — well, one officer who worked in the homicide department picked it up. A couple of other civilian secretaries were very close to Sergeant Sturdivant joined in." [Pla. Dep. at 141]. Plaintiff was asked and testified to the following:
Q. So . . . some of these comments were made by Sergeant Sturdivant?
A. Sergeant Sturdivant, Share Hampton Barber, Officer Renee Charleston. And another detective in homicide, but I can't recall his name.
[Pla. Dep. at 142].
Plaintiff alleges that the disparaging comments were pervasive. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held, "Either severity or pervasiveness is sufficient to establish" a hostile work environment. Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., 594 F.3d 798, 808 (11th Cir. 2010) (emphasis in original). Plaintiff testified that [*58]  Sergeant Sturdivant refused to refer to Plaintiff by name and instead only referred to her as "Ms. Haiti." [PSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Aff. ¶ 7; Pla. Dep. at 141]. According to Plaintiff, Sergeant Sturdivant referred to all of the other recruits by name. [Id.].
Plaintiff also testified that she was subjected to other forms of pervasive harassment while working as a police recruit. Plaintiff stated in her affidavit, "In addition to derogatory comments, I would come to work and find urine in my chair and fruits on my desk that I had been [sic] previously discarded. I began bringing plastic bags to work to cover my chair, in fear of what substance I would find in it that morning." [Pla. Aff. ¶ 9]. At her deposition, Plaintiff testified:
I was bullied and harassed. . . . I found urine on my chair every day. I found like one of her friends started offering me a peach. I said, no, thank you. Every morning for the next month I would come in and find that same peach in front of my desk. The next day I have to bring a plastic trash bag from my house to cover—imagine a big place [sic] to cover my chair like this, because it will be filled with urine.
[Pla. Dep. at 178-79]. Plaintiff testified that no other [*59]  recruit in her department was subjected to this level of harassment. [Pla. Aff. ¶ 9].
The court finds that Plaintiff has alleged with sufficient specificity the severity and pervasiveness of the offensive comments and harassment. See Reeves, 594 F.3d at 811 (holding that a jury could find that the workplace harassment was severe and pervasive because inter alia the misconduct occurred "on a daily basis"). Plaintiff's claim is not based on isolated incidents but on remarks and actions that occurred on a regular basis. And although there is no evidence that the conduct unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff's job performance, the disparaging comments and misconduct were humiliating and not a "mere offensive utterance[.]" Adams, 754 F.3d at 1250 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The alleged comments by Sergeant Sturdivant to Plaintiff (saying "you people do nothing but run down there in Port-au-Prince," accusing Plaintiff of mixing soup with human bones, and continuously referring to Plaintiff as "Ms. Haiti") were frequent and denigrating. [PSMF ¶ 15; Pla. Dep. at 141; Pla. Aff. ¶ 8]. The same is true with regard to Plaintiff's allegation that she frequently found urine in her chair and discarded fruit on her desk. [*60]  [Pla. Aff. ¶ 9; Pla. Dep. at 178-79]. Under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person in Plaintiff's situation would find the harassing remarks and conduct sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of her employment. Therefore, she has established the fourth prima facie element of a Title VII hostile work environment claim based on national origin.
The final prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that Defendant City of Atlanta is responsible for the hostile work environment based upon respondeat superior. In Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 2292-93 (1998), and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 2270 (1998), the Supreme Court held, "An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee." If the supervisor's harassment does not culminate into a "tangible employment action," then the employer can avoid vicarious liability through the affirmative defense created by the Supreme Court in Faragher and Ellerth. However, "[i]f the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, the employer is strictly liable." Vance v. Ball State Univ., 133 S. Ct. 2434, 2439 (2013).
Plaintiff argues that Defendant is strictly liable and that no [*61]  affirmative defense is available because Sergeant Sturdivant's harassment culminated in Plaintiff's termination. The court disagrees. There is no evidence that Sturdivant or any other alleged harasser was involved in the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Sergeant Condon was the supervisor who initially recommended that Plaintiff be terminated, and Plaintiff does not allege that Condon, or any other decisionmaker, harassed Plaintiff on the basis of her national origin. A reasonable jury could not find that there is a causal link between the alleged harassment experienced by Plaintiff and her termination. As a result, she cannot establish that Defendant is strictly liable based on a tangible employment action theory.8 See Reyna v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 506 F. Supp. 2d 1363, 1374 (M.D. Ga. 2007); Taylor v. CSX Transportation, 418 F. Supp. 2d 1284, 1297 (M.D. Ala. 2006).
Because Sturdivant's alleged harassment of Plaintiff did not culminate into a "tangible employment action," Defendant City of Atlanta can avoid vicarious liability through the Faragher/Ellerth affirmative defense. This defense consists of two necessary elements: "(a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any . . . harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed [*62]  to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2292-93; Ellerth, 118 S. Ct. at 2270. "Both elements must be satisfied for the defendant-employer to avoid liability, and the defendant bears the burden of proof on both elements." Frederick, 246 F.3d at 1313.
Defendant argues that the first element is satisfied because the City of Atlanta "had in place both an actual anti-harassment policy and also an informal anti-harassment policy." [Doc. 30 at 23]. Citing Atlanta Code of Ordinances Section 114-169, Defendant asserts that the City's policy provides that "any employee alleging discrimination in any personnel action shall have the right to consult with the equal employment opportunity coordinator of such employee's department or of the applicant's proposed department and with the diversity manager." [Id. at 23-24]. Defendant also alleges that Sergeant Condon and Plaintiff's other supervisors and Sergeants encouraged their subordinates to report any issue in the workplace. The court finds that Defendant has failed to carry its burden on this issue.9
As Plaintiff correctly notes, Sergeant Condon testified that there was a "policy in place for recruits who felt that they are being treated unfairly," but he [*63]  did not know if it was disseminated to the recruits. [Condon Dep. at 28-29]. Condon was asked and testified:
Q: Is [the policy] something that is handed to the recruits or employees in your — do you know?
A: I don't know.
Q: So you don't know if it's handed to the recruits?
A: I don't know if it is or not.
Q: Is there some place online or elsewhere that recruits can review this that you know about?
A: There might be. I can't say for certain.
Q: So you don't know where its memorialized, you just know that there's a policy?
A: Yes.
[Condon Dep. at 29]. Condon testified that during orientation, he told recruits: "If you have any issues, any problems in your current job assignment or, you know, let me know, and we'll figure something out." [Id.]. When Condon was asked if recruits were "encouraged to speak out against any type of harassment or bullying," he testified: "I wouldn't say they were encouraged to — they were told, If you have an issue, come see me and we'll try to figure out what the problem is." [Id. at 30].
Given Sergeant Condon's testimony, the court finds that a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant did not exercise reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassment. Even [*64]  if the court were to assume that during the relevant time Defendant had an anti-harassment policy in place, Defendant cannot establish the Faragher/Ellerth affirmative defense because there is no evidence that the City of Atlanta Police Department effectively published or disseminated the policy to its employees. Dissemination of an employer's harassment policy is "fundamental to meeting the requirement for exercising reasonable care in preventing . . . harassment." Madray v. Publix Supermarkets, Inc., 208 F.3d 1290, 1298 (11th Cir. 2000). As previously discussed, Condon testified that he believed that there was a general "policy in place for recruits who felt that they are being treated unfairly," but he did not know if it was given to recruits or where it could be found. [Condon Dep. at 28-29]. The lack of evidence indicating that a harassment policy was disseminated to police recruits is fatal to Defendant's affirmative defense. The Eleventh Circuit has held that in order for an employer to establish that it took reasonable steps to prevent harassment, it must show that its "harassment policy was effectively published. . . ." Frederick, 246 F.3d at 1314 (citing Madray, 208 F.3d at 1298-99). Because a reasonable jury reviewing the record evidence could conclude that Defendant did not provide to its employees [*65]  an effective mechanism for reporting and resolving complaints of harassment, the court finds that Defendant is unable to show that it took reasonable steps to prevent and correctly promptly any harassment, the first element of the Faragher/Ellerth affirmative defense.10 See Faragher, 118 S. Ct. at 2292.
In summary, Plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment, and Defendant is unable to establish the Faragher/Ellerth affirmative defense. It is, therefore, RECOMMENDED that Defendants' summary judgment motion [Doc. 30] be DENIED on Plaintiff's Title VII hostile work environment claim [Doc. 1, Count III] based on national origin.

IV. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons and cited authority, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 30] be GRANTED on the following claims: Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate claim [Doc. 1, Count I]; and Plaintiff's ADA claim that she was terminated on the basis of her disability [Doc. 1, Count I].
The undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 30] be DENIED on the following claims: Plaintiff's ADA retaliatory termination claim [Doc. 1, Count II]; Plaintiff's Title VII claim that she was terminated [*66]  based on her national origin [Doc. 1, Count III]; and Plaintiff's Title VII hostile work environment claim based on national origin [Doc. 1, Count III].
All pretrial matters have been concluded with the issuance of this Report and Recommendation in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), this Court's Local Rule 72.1, and Standing Order 14-01 (N.D. Ga. August 15, 2014). The Clerk, therefore, is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the Magistrate Judge.
SO RECOMMENDED this 3rd day of June, 2016.
