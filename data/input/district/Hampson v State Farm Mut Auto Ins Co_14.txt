MEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Dawn Hampson ("Plaintiff") brings this action against Defendant State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co. ("Defendant" or "State Farm"), alleging four causes of action: (1) disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213; (2) disability discrimination in violation of the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"), N.Y. Exec. Law §§ 290-301; (3) retaliation in violation of the ADA; and (4) retaliation in violation of the NYSHRL. (Complaint ("Compl."), Dkt. No. 1, ¶¶ 38-71). Defendant has moved for summary judgment on all four claims. (Dkt. No. 27). For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.

II. BACKGROUND1
Plaintiff Dawn Hampson began working at State Farm in 1997, and State Farm promoted her to the position of "Level 2" Auto Claim Representative in 2003. (Statement of Uncontested [*2]  Material Facts ("SMF"), Dkt. No. 27-2, ¶¶ 1-2; Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts ("Pl. Resp. SMF"), Dkt. No. 33, ¶¶ 1-2). Raymond Diaz was Plaintiff's "Team Manager" and direct supervisor from 2005 until the end of her employment at State Farm in 2011. (SMF, ¶ 5; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶ 5).

A. The Work of an Auto Claim Representative
Auto Claim Representatives handle a range of tasks relating to insurance claims, including reviewing documents and communicating with claimants, policy-holders, doctors, and attorneys in order to resolve claims. (SMF, ¶ 8; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶ 8). Generally, Auto Claim Representatives are expected to handle three to four claims per day. (SMF, ¶¶ 9-10; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶¶ 9-10). Plaintiff testified that all of these tasks are performed via computer and telephone using a computerized queue. (Hampson Dep., pp. 17-20, 22-24).
Plaintiff testified that as a Claim Representative, her work involved reviewing new automobile accident claims. (Hampson Dep., pp. 17, 19). She explained that she received new claims "electronically" via computer (Hampson Dep., p. 18), by clicking into a "work queue" and clicking on "New Claims." (Hampson Dep., [*3]  p. 24). To review a claim, she would click on it, "review the facts of the accident, review who was driving, who was injured [and] what happened in the accident." (Hampson Dep., p. 18). Plaintiff testified that she would "make the first contact with the injured party, and anyone else involved with the claim" by calling them. (Hampson Dep., pp. 17, 20). Next, she would "send out the proper paperwork to the injured party [and] explain the claims process to them." (Hampson Dep., pp. 17-18). Plaintiff testified that she did this electronically, stating: "[Y]ou just do it on your screen, and it automatically goes to a printer, and the secretary takes it off the printer and mails it out." (Hampson Dep., p. 22). Plaintiff testified that it was also part of her job to review medical bills, which she did by "pull[ing] up the medical bill on the screen" and reviewing it "to see what treatment was received" and whether it was "related to the accident." (Hampson Dep., p. 22).
The parties agree that timely service is an important part of an Auto Claim Representative's duties, and that Auto Claim Representatives need to be available "on a regular basis and during normal business hours in order to [*4]  provide continued and consistent service for the claim files they are personally assigned." (SMF, ¶¶ 12, 16; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶¶ 12, 16). For example, when Auto Claim Representatives receive new insurance claims in their queues, they "must make initial contact with the claimant or representative within 48 hours," engage in "follow-up communications, obtain medical or other information . . . and . . . maintain . . . communications with others in order to achieve the efficient and timely disposition of claims." (Diaz Decl., ¶ 4).

B. Plaintiff's History of Absences
Plaintiff began to take frequent absences from work in 2005 due to "a variety of conditions, including but not limited to migraine headaches." (Defendant's Reply Statement of Uncontested Material Facts ("Def. Reply SMF"), Dkt. No. 34-2, ¶¶ 17-18; SMF, ¶¶ 17-18; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶¶ 17-18). Plaintiff explained in her affidavit that the migraine headaches limit her "ability to walk, stand, hear, eat[,] sleep, concentrate and perform manual tasks including lifting." (Hampson Aff., ¶ 1). Plaintiff stated that during her "most severe migraines" she is "hypersensitive to light and noise and often experience[s] nausea and vomiting." (Hampson [*5]  Aff., ¶ 4). Plaintiff testified that as a result of these symptoms, the "constant glare of the lights" and "background noise" made working at the office during a migraine difficult. (Hampson Dep., p. 103).
Some of Plaintiff's absences were "protected" by the Family and Medical Leave Act2 ("FMLA"). Plaintiff used personal sick leave for the remaining absences. (Def. Reply SMF, ¶ 17). There is no dispute as to the actual number of days Plaintiff was absent from work as reflected in State Farm's records.3 (Def. Reply SMF, ¶¶ 17, 25, 30, 34, 43, 55, 78). Diaz met with Plaintiff numerous times between 2005 and 2011 to address Plaintiff's frequent absences and their effect on State Farm's operations. (SMF, ¶ 22; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶ 22). Diaz issued memoranda to Plaintiff documenting the details of these meetings, and Plaintiff testified in her deposition that the facts reflected in each memorandum are accurate. (Def. Reply SMF, ¶¶ 22-35, 41-44, 53-57, 76-80). Plaintiff's frequent absences were also a theme in many of her performance reviews, and Plaintiff sometimes received low performance ratings based in part on her frequent absences. (SMF, ¶¶ 36-39; 45-51, 81-84; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶¶ 36-39; 45-51, [*6]  81-84). Each of the various meetings and performance reviews between Diaz and Plaintiff are detailed below.
On August 31, 2005, Diaz issued a memorandum to Plaintiff titled "Reliability and the Impact on Customer Service, Teamwork, and Morale." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 6). In it, Diaz recounted meetings between himself and Plaintiff "on July 27, 2005 and August 23, 2005 to discuss the negative impact [her] unplanned and unprotected absences [had on State Farm's] customers and on [her] team." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 6). Diaz noted that Plaintiff had taken 17.5 days of personal sick leave between January 2005 and August 2005. (Dkt. No. 27-4, pp. 6-7). While Diaz acknowledged that Plaintiff performed "at a proficient level" when at work, he asserted that her absences impacted the team and required her teammates "to not only complete their tasks, but [hers] as well." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 7). Diaz advised Plaintiff that "[i]f this trend continue[d] additional disciplinary action [would] be taken." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 7).
On August 14, 2006, Plaintiff and Diaz met to discuss Plaintiff's "availability and reliability to the team." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 9). After the meeting, Diaz issued a memorandum to Plaintiff [*7]  noting that she had taken nearly 11 days of personal sick leave between April 2006 and July 2006. (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 9). Diaz again warned that "[i]f this trend continue[d], additional disciplinary action [would] be taken . . . including a recommendation for termination of your employment." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 9).
On January 26, 2007, Plaintiff and Diaz met again concerning her absences. (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 12). Diaz noted that Plaintiff had taken 15 days of personal sick leave between October 2006 and December 2006. (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 12). Diaz issued a memorandum to Plaintiff following the meeting stating that he was "concerned with the frequency of [her] unplanned and unprotected absences and the impact it [was] having on [State Farm's] operation." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 13). He advised Plaintiff that as a result, he would "no longer grant any permission absences, until [she] consistently [met] the expectations regarding availability and reliability." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 13). Diaz also warned Plaintiff of possible disciplinary measures, including termination of employment. (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 13).
In her performance evaluation for the 2006-2007 performance year, Plaintiff received a rating [*8]  of 1 (out of 3), which means "[a]chieved some expectations, but missed others." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 25). The evaluation praised Plaintiff as a "fast and decisive claim representative" but indicated that Plaintiff needed "to improve on her reliability to the team and to her customers." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 25).
The following performance year, 2007-2008, Plaintiff received a rating of 2, meaning that she "[c]onsistently met and occasionally exceeded expectations." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 41). In the evaluation, Diaz noted that Plaintiff had "been more available to the team." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 40).
Diaz met with Plaintiff in November 2008 to "discuss" her "availability and reliability to the team." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 43). According to a memorandum from Diaz to Plaintiff dated November 17, 2008, Plaintiff had taken 28 days of "non-FMLA protected absence" between January 21, 2008 and November 4, 2008. (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 43). Diaz warned Plaintiff, as before, that "[i]f this trend continues additional disciplinary action may be taken," including termination of her employment. (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 44).
In her 2008-2009 performance evaluation, Plaintiff received a rating of 1, according to Diaz, "in significant [*9]  part because of her attendance." ( Diaz Decl., Dkt. No. 27-3, ¶ 11). In her 2009-2010 performance evaluation, Plaintiff received a rating of 2. (Diaz Decl., ¶ 12). Diaz explained that although she received a higher rating, "her absences still remained an issue." (Id.).
On May 26, 2010, Plaintiff and Diaz met again to discuss her "availability and reliability to the team." (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 70). In the memorandum Diaz issued to Plaintiff in connection with their meeting, Diaz noted that Plaintiff had taken 22.42 "days of non-FMLA protected" leave in a five-month period. (Dkt. No. 27-4, p. 70).
In May 2010, Diaz contacted Mia Grant, a State Farm human resources representative, regarding Plaintiff's absences. (Def. Reply SMF, ¶ 52). In his declaration, Diaz stated that "he explained . . . that Ms. Hampson had been able to cover many of her absences under the FMLA leave guidelines, but that her FMLA [protected leave] had run out and her continuing absences were unprotected." (Diaz Decl., ¶ 14).

C. Meeting with Grant and Diaz4
At some point in either the Spring of 2010 or July 2010, Grant and Diaz together met with Plaintiff to discuss her frequent absences. (Def. Reply SMF, ¶ 63). The parties' [*10]  accounts of this meeting conflict. Diaz stated that in July 2010, he and Grant (Grant by telephone) met with Plaintiff to discuss her "absences and attendance issue." (Diaz Decl., ¶ 15). According to Diaz, he and Grant advised Plaintiff to pursue State Farm's ADA "Accommodation Request process5 if she had medical issues requiring a workplace accommodation." (Id.). Diaz stated that they explained that State Farm had an "interactive process" that Plaintiff could begin by submitting the requisite forms to State Farm's Accommodation Request Committee. (Id.).
According to Diaz, during the July 2010 meeting, Plaintiff asked about "working from home." (Diaz Decl., ¶ 15). Diaz stated that he "explained that she should make that request using State Farm's ADA Accommodation Request process and the ADA Accommodation Request Committee would consider it." (Id.). Diaz asserted that he emphasized that he "did not know" and "could not guarantee" whether Plaintiff's request to work from home would be granted. (Id.). Diaz stated that when Plaintiff asked what would happen if her request to work from home was not approved, he responded that "termination of her employment would continue to be a possibility [*11]  due to the business impact of her reliability and attendance, unless her reliability and attendance improved." (Diaz Decl., ¶ 15). Diaz asserted that he encouraged Plaintiff to make a request and told her that the "Committee would consider any request for [a] reasonable accommodation by her." (Id.).
Plaintiff disputes State Farm's version of this meeting. Plaintiff asserted in her verified complaint that she first requested an accommodation in "the Spring of 2010." (Compl., ¶ 31). During her deposition, however, Plaintiff could not recall when she first asked Diaz about an accommodation for her disability: she testified that it was sometime in 2010 during a "conference call" with Diaz and an "HR person." (Hampson Dep., pp. 80, 86, 84). Plaintiff testified that during the conference call, she verbally requested the accommodation of working full-time but "part-time telecommut[ing]" on the days that she had migraines. (Hampson Dep., p. 102). Plaintiff also testified:
Q: Do you remember even Mr. Diaz or the HR representative explaining the process for an ADA accommodation?
A: They explained the process, yes.
Q: Okay. And what did they explain the process as being?
A: That I would put in the [*12]  request, and it would be reviewed, and if it was determined that I needed to work from home even on a part-time basis, I would not have a job with them anymore because they do not accommodate that.
(Hampson Dep., pp. 87-88).
Plaintiff testified that she asked for a periodic telecommuting accommodation because her migraines caused "sensitivity to light and sounds," and she believed that working from home would allow her to eliminate those stimuli "so [she] could still sit on the laptop and do [her] job without the increased issues." (Hampson Dep., pp. 78, 90). Plaintiff stated that she did not pursue State Farm's accommodation request process because the human resources representative "made it clear to me that if the assessment board determined that I needed to work from home, even on a part-time basis, I would not have job because State Farm did not accommodate telecommuting." (Hampson Dep., pp. 95-96).

D. September 2010 Assignment and Subsequent Evaluation
In September 2010, State Farm assigned Plaintiff to a "floater" position in the Multi-Jurisdictional Unit, with the intent "that, as a floater, [Plaintiff] would not have a fixed caseload, and there could be more flexibility with her [*13]  attendance." (Diaz Decl., ¶ 19). Plaintiff acknowledged in her deposition that State Farm provided her with that position "in an attempt to assist" her. (Hampson Dep., p. 73). Diaz stated in his declaration that "even on this assignment, [Plaintiff's] continued failure to maintain regular and reliable attendance caused her to not meet the expectations for the job, and the assignment ended." (Diaz Decl., ¶ 19).
On November 29, 2010, Diaz met with Plaintiff to discuss "her availability and reliability to her team." (Diaz Decl, ¶ 20). Diaz also issued a memorandum to Plaintiff noting that between July 15, 2010 and November 2010, she had "taken 20 days of non-FMLA protected absence." (Dkt. No. 27-5, p. 82). Diaz again advised Plaintiff to "reduce the number of non-FMLA protected absences" and warned that if she did not, she would be subject to disciplinary actions, including termination of her employment. (Dkt. No. 27-5, p. 83).
In March 2011, Plaintiff received her 2010-2011 performance evaluation. (Diaz Decl., ¶ 21). She received a rating of 1, the lowest rating. (Id.). The evaluation noted Plaintiff's continued attendance issues and lack of availability. (Id.).

E. Termination of Plaintiff's [*14]  Employment
On March 29, 2011, Diaz wrote two drafts of a memorandum recommending that State Farm terminate Plaintiff's employment. (Diaz Decl., ¶ 22). The first draft of the memorandum included a discussion of all of Plaintiff's sick days, including those that were protected by the FMLA. (Dkt. No. 30-21). Diaz noted that Plaintiff had averaged 50 to 80 days of paid sick leave annually since 2006. Id. (Dkt. No. 30-21, p.1). Diaz stated that Plaintiff had "a serious medical condition," that she had "provided documentation" of that condition to State Farm's Employee Health Services Department, which had "medically supported her paid sick leave." (Id.). The second and final draft of the memorandum discussed only those sick days that were not protected by the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and did not mention Plaintiff's medical condition. (Dkt. No. 30-22). Both drafts of the memorandum stated that the recommendation was based upon Plaintiff's "inability to maintain regular and reliable attendance which has impacted her ability to perform the functions of an Auto Claim Representative at the expected level, provide quality customer service and maintain an owned claim inventory." (Dkt Nos. [*15]  30-21, 30-22). In his supplemental declaration, Diaz stated that he revised the memorandum "to focus on Ms. Hampson's non-FMLA absences because [his] recommendation of termination was based on those absences and not her prior FMLA-protected absences." (Dkt. No. 34-1). State Farm approved Diaz's recommendation and terminated Plaintiff's employment on April 20, 2011. (Def. Reply SMF, ¶ 93).
Diaz stated that in early April 2011, he and Grant spoke to Plaintiff "regarding her performance and excessive absences." (Dkt. No. 27-3, ¶ 23). According to Diaz, State Farm subsequently approved his "recommendation to terminate Ms. Hampson's employment . . . for the reasons stated in [his] memorandum and the negative impact that her absences were having on the unit's operations." (Id., ¶ 24). On April 20, 2011, Grant and Diaz met with Plaintiff to inform her that her employment had been terminated. (SMF, ¶ 93; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶ 93; Hampson Dep., pp. 42-44).
Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on June 9, 2011. (Compl., ¶ 18). Plaintiff's EEOC charge alleged that "State Farm wrongfully discharged Hampson . . . because of her disability, and [*16]  failed to reasonably accommodate her request for a position that would allow her to periodically work at home." (Dkt. No. 31-1, ¶ 5). Plaintiff also charged that State Farm retaliated against her after she had requested a reasonable accommodation for her disability. (Dkt. No. 31-1, ¶ 16). The EEOC mailed Plaintiff a Notice of Right to Sue on December 22, 2011, and Plaintiff timely filed this suit on February 10, 2012. (Compl., ¶¶ 20-21).

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), summary judgment may be granted only if all the submissions taken together "show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating "the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. A fact is "material" if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law," and is genuinely in dispute "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248; see also Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 553 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Anderson). The movant may meet this burden by showing that the nonmoving party has "fail[ed] to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element [*17]  essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; see also Selevan v. N.Y. Thruway Auth., 711 F.3d 253, 256 (2d Cir. 2013) (summary judgment appropriate where the non-moving party fails to "come forth with evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable juror to return a verdict in his or her favor on an essential element of a claim") (internal quotation marks omitted).
If the moving party meets this burden, the nonmoving party must "set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 250; see also Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323-24; Wright v. Goord, 554 F.3d 255, 266 (2d Cir. 2009). "When ruling on a summary judgment motion, the district court must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant." Dallas Aerospace, Inc. v. CIS Air Corp., 352 F.3d 775, 780 (2d Cir. 2003). Still, the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts," Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), and cannot rely on "mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment." Knight v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., 804 F.2d 9, 12 (2d Cir.1986) (quoting Quarles v. Gen. Motors Corp., 758 F.2d 839, 840 (2d Cir. 1985)). Furthermore, "[m]ere conclusory allegations or denials cannot by themselves create a genuine issue of material fact where none would otherwise exist." Hicks v. Baines, 593 F.3d 159, 166 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Fletcher v. Atex, Inc., 68 F.3d 1451, 1456 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).

 [*18] IV. DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff has alleged: (1) that Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability; and (2) that Defendant terminated her employment because of her disability, in violation of the ADA and NYSHRL. "Claims alleging disability discrimination in violation of the ADA are subject to the burden-shifting analysis originally established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)." McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125 (2d Cir. 2013). Genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on both theories.

1. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation
In order to make out a prima facie case for failure to provide reasonable accommodation under both the ADA and NYSHRL, Plaintiff must show that (1) she has a disability within the meaning of the relevant statute; (2) Defendant had notice of her disability; (3) she could have performed the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation; and (4) Defendant refused to make the necessary reasonable accommodations.6McMillan, 711 F.3d at 125-26 (quoting McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 2009)); Miloscia v. B.R. Guest Holdings LLC, 33 Misc. 3d 466, 928 N.Y.S.2d 905, 913 (Sup. Ct. 2011) aff'd in part, modified in part, 94 A.D.3d 563, 942 N.Y.S.2d 484 (1st Dep't 2012).
Under federal regulations, once an employer becomes aware of an employee's need for accommodation, the employer should initiate an informal, interactive process in order to [*19]  determine whether a reasonable accommodation exists. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). The NYSHRL likewise instructs employers to "give individualized consideration to [an employee's] request [for accommodation]" and not to "arbitrarily reject the employee's proposal without further inquiry." Jacobsen v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosps. Corp., 22 N.Y.3d 824, 836, 988 N.Y.S.2d 86, 11 N.E.3d 159 (2014).
If an employee establishes a prima facie case for failure to accommodate, the burden shifts to the employer, who can avoid liability by showing that granting an accommodation would have caused an undue hardship.7Medlin v. Rome Strip Steel Co., 294 F. Supp. 2d 279, 288 (N.D.N.Y. 2003); Vangas v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., 6 F. Supp. 3d 400 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). See also McMillan, 711 F.3d at 129 (stating that pretext is not an issue in a failure to accommodate case). "[T]o defeat a defendant/employer's motion for summary judgment," an employee "need only show that an 'accommodation' seems reasonable on its face, i.e., ordinarily or in the run of cases. Once the plaintiff has made this showing, the defendant/employer then must show special (typically case-specific) circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship in the particular circumstances." U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-402, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002) (internal citations omitted).
The Court finds that Plaintiff has presented facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case for failure to provide reasonable accommodation, and that Defendant has failed to address the issue [*20]  of undue hardship. Therefore, there are genuine issues of material fact as to Plaintiff's first and second causes of action, and the Court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment on those claims.

a. Plaintiff's Disability
The ADA defines a "disability" as, inter alia, "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of [an] individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). "Major life activities" include "eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting" and other activities. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i). The EEOC has stated that courts should determine whether an impairment "substantially limits" a "major life activity as compared to most people in the general population," without regard to "the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures" other than glasses or contact lenses. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(ii), (vi). The term "substantially limits" should be "construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage" and the inquiry into this threshold issue "should not demand extensive analysis." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(i), (iii).
The NYSHRL defines a "disability" as, inter alia, "(a) a physical, mental or medical impairment resulting from anatomical, physiological, genetic or neurological conditions which prevents the exercise of a normal bodily function or is demonstrable [*21]  by medically accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques." N.Y. Exec. Law § 292(21). The definition of "disability" under the NYSHRL does not require Plaintiff to prove that she is limited in one or more major life activities, so long as she has a "medically diagnosable impairment." Reeves v. Johnson Controls World Servs., Inc., 140 F.3d 144, 155 (2d Cir. 1998), superseded in nonpertinent part by statute, 42 U.S.C. § 12102, as recognized in Hilton v. Wright, 673 F.3d 120, 128-29 (2d Cir. 2012).8
Plaintiff alleged in her affidavit that she suffers from chronic migraines, and that her migraines substantially limit her "ability to walk, stand, see, hear, eat[,] sleep, concentrate and perform manual tasks including lifting." (Hampson Aff., ¶¶ 2-3). Plaintiff also submitted an affidavit from her doctor, Eugene K. Merecki, M.D., who stated that Plaintiff "suffers from severe migraine headaches which periodically and episodically can be debilitating." (Affidavit of Eugene K. Merecki, M.D. ("Merecki Aff."), Dkt. No. 31-13, ¶ 4). Courts have held that chronic migraine headaches may constitute a disability under the ADA where a plaintiff establishes that his or her migraines limit one or more major life activities.9See Carlson v. InaCom Corp., 885 F. Supp. 1314, 1320 (D. Neb. 1995); see also Lu Frahm v. Holy Family Hosp. of Estherville Inc., No. 95 Civ. 3011, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23273, at *11, 1996 WL 33423407, at *4 (N.D. Iowa Oct. 30, 1996) (finding a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff who suffered from migraines was disabled under the ADA). Thus, [*22]  given Plaintiff's minimal burden at the prima facie stage, Plaintiff's claim that her migraines limit major life activities including her ability to stand, walk, see, hear, and eat, is sufficient to establish the first element of the prima facie case. Based on Dr. Merecki's statement that Plaintiff suffers debilitating migraine headaches, Plaintiff has also presented sufficient evidence to establish, at the prima facie stage, that she is disabled under the NYSHRL. Levine v. Smithtown Cent. Sch. Dist., 565 F. Supp. 2d 407, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (quoting Lovely H. v. Eggleston, 235 F.R.D. 248, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (stating that the NYSHRL definition of disability covers any individual whose "impairment is demonstrable by medically accepted techniques").

b. Defendant's Knowledge of Plaintiff's Disability
Next, Plaintiff must show that State Farm knew of her disability at the time it decided to terminate her employment.10See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9; Volmar v. Cold Spring Hills Ctr. for Nursing & Rehab., 395 F. App'x 795, 796 (2d Cir. 2010); Arnett v. Brownlee, 211 F. App'x 526, 526-27 (8th Cir. 2006). If State Farm "knew or reasonably should have known" that Plaintiff was disabled, it had a duty to reasonably accommodate her disability. Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir. 2008). See also 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff provided State Farm with documentation of her disability in connection with her requests for FMLA leave, and that Diaz was aware that Plaintiff had a "serious medical condition," which he referenced [*23]  in a first draft of his memorandum recommending termination of Plaintiff's employment. (See SMF, ¶¶ 17-18; Dkt. No. 30-21). While Defendant does not concede that it had knowledge of Plaintiff's disability, it has not raised any argument or evidence in support of a claim that it lacked knowledge. (Dkt. No. 27-1, p. 14). These facts are sufficient, at the prima facie stage, to establish the second element of Plaintiff's prima facie case.

c. Existence of a Reasonable Accommodation
The ADA provides that a "qualified individual with a disability" is one who can perform "the essential functions" of his or her position "with or without reasonable accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). The NYSHRL similarly requires proof that "upon the provision of reasonable accommodations, [the employee] could perform the essential functions of [his or] her job." Jacobsen v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosps., Corp., 22 N.Y.3d 824, 834, 988 N.Y.S.2d 86, 11 N.E.3d 159 (2014) (citations omitted). In determining the essential functions of a position, a court must conduct "a fact-specific inquiry into both the employer's description of a job and how the job is actually performed in practice." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 126 (citation omitted). In this case the parties agree that regular availability during normal business hours (whether in person or via computer and telephone) [*24]  is an essential function of an Auto Claim Representative's position. (SMF, ¶ 16; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶ 16). Because the evidence on the record relates only to the potential accommodation of periodic work at home, the Court will limit its discussion to that accommodation.
The parties disagree about whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job while periodically working from home. Defendant argues: (1) that Plaintiff has not shown that any Auto Claim Representative could perform the essential functions of that position while working remotely; and (2) that Plaintiff's testimony indicated that she would not be able to work at all, even from home, on numerous occasions when her migraine symptoms were severe. (Dkt. No. 27-1, pp. 19-21). Construing the facts in Plaintiff's favor, there are material issues of fact as to whether Plaintiff could have performed the essential functions of the claim representative position with periodic telecommuting.
i. Essential Functions
Courts have recognized that physical attendance in the workplace is an "essential function" of many positions. See, e.g., Mason v. Avaya Communs., Inc., 357 F.3d 1114, 1119-20 (10th Cir. 2004) (citing cases in which courts recognized physical presence as an essential job function); [*25]  id. at 1124 (considering the reasonableness of requests to work at home "on a case-by-case basis," and holding that the plaintiff's request to work at home was unreasonable because her physical presence was an essential function of her job as a service coordinator). The Second Circuit has noted that while working from home is "potentially problematic," and requests to work at home unsupervised have been found to be unreasonable, there is precedent that "implie[s] . . . that permitting unsupervised work [from home] might, in some cases, constitute a reasonable accommodation." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 128 n.4; see, e.g., Nixon-Tinkelman v. N.Y. City Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 434 Fed. Appx. 17, 20 (2d Cir. 2011) (remanding for district court to consider whether employer could have reasonably accommodated employee by, inter alia, "allowing her to work from home"); see also E.E.O.C. v. Ford Motor Co., 752 F.3d 634, 647 (6th Cir. 2014), reh'g en banc granted, opinion vacated (Aug. 29, 2014) (holding that a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether telecommuting could be a reasonable accommodation for an employee whose disability resulted in frequent absences from work); Goonan v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., 916 F. Supp. 2d 470, 484 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (holding that plaintiff, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and feared working in an office near the site of the World Trade Center, pleaded sufficient factual allegations to show that his employer [*26]  failed to provide a reasonable accommodation when it refused to consider telecommuting or an office transfer); Vangas v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., 6 F. Supp. 3d 400, 418-19 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (finding "issues of fact . . . regarding the reasonableness of plaintiff's request to work from home").
State Farm argues that timely processing of claims requires that its claim representatives make initial contact with involved parties within 48 hours and be available on a regular basis during normal business hours in order to process claims efficiently. Plaintiff, however, has not sought to work during alternative hours. She only seeks permission to work from home periodically during migraine episodes. Plaintiff testified that as an auto claim representative, she received claim assignments through an electronic queue and reviewed the claims on her computer, including the facts of the accident, injuries and all medical bills. According to Plaintiff, her contact with involved parties was by telephone and if she needed to "send out paperwork," she sent it to a printer, where a secretary would remove it and place it in the mail. Plaintiff also averred that she often received supervision via email. (Hampson Aff. ¶¶ 49-50).
Additionally, Plaintiff presented evidence that State [*27]  Farm previously allowed two other employees, Lori Ercolini and Rene Streicher, who were also involved in processing claims (though in different capacities than Plaintiff) to perform work from home during various periods of time. Lori Ercolini testified that she is a nurse reviewer, and handles questions from both claim representatives and claim processors regarding medical bills. (Ercolini Dep., pp. 6, 10). She stated that she worked from home between 2003 and 2005, first on a part-time basis and then on a full-time basis, to care for her sick mother. (Ercolini Dep., pp. 14, 17-18). According to Ercolini, State Farm came to her home to set up a fax machine, printer and phones, and provided her with a computer that allowed her to access the State Farm database. (Ercolini Dep., pp. 14, 16). Ercolini testified that she was able to work productively from home. (Ercolini Dep., pp. 16-17).
Streicher, like Plaintiff, was a claim representative, but at a more advanced level. (Streicher Dep., p. 9). Streicher testified that as an "RB-3" (or level 3) claim representative, she managed her own claim inventory, trained other claim representatives, and did "a lot of project work."11 (Id.). Streicher [*28]  testified that during 2011 she worked at home a couple of times per week. (Streicher Dep., p. 13). Streicher stated that she did overtime work from home, beyond what a typical claim representative would handle during the work day. (Streicher Dep., pp. 25-26). Streicher testified that although State Farm provided a laptop, which allowed her to access all of the programs necessary to do her computer work, her productivity was slow because the laptop was "half the speed of a CPU at work." (Streicher Dep., pp. 15-16, 26-27). Although Streicher testified that her work by phone could not have been done from home because she did not have access to the "phone path" (Streicher Dep., pp. 26-27), Ercolini testified that when she worked from home, she used a "system" in her home that State Farm set up for her, which included "phones." (Ercolini Dep., p. 14).
Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, she has raised a material issue of fact regarding whether an auto claims representative could perform the essential functions of the job with periodic telecommuting.
ii. Performance of Essential Functions
"After the essential functions of the position are determined, the plaintiff must [*29]  demonstrate that he or she could have performed these functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, at the time of the termination." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 127. "This burden is not heavy: 'It is enough for the plaintiff to suggest the existence of a plausible accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits.'" Id. (quoting Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1995).
As defendant argues, Plaintiff's long history of absenteeism bears on the issue of whether she could perform the essential function of being available during regular business hours to handle insurance claims. See, e.g., Vandenbroek v. PSEG Power, CT LLC, 356 F. App'x 457 (2d Cir. 2009) (summary order); cf. Teahan v. Metro-N. Commuter R.R. Co., 80 F.3d 50, 55 (2d Cir. 1996) (affirming district court's decision, after trial in a case under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that plaintiff who posed a risk of reoccurring absenteeism was not "otherwise qualified").12 Here, it is not clear how many of Plaintiff's absences were related to her migraine headaches. The parties stipulated that her personal sick leave absences were caused by a variety of conditions, including but not limited to migraine headaches. (Def. Reply SMF, ¶ 18). In Diaz's first draft of his memorandum recommending termination, he stated that Plaintiff "averaged 50 to 80 days of Paid Sick Leave (PSL) annually;" that Plaintiff [*30]  had "a serious medical condition;" and that the Employee Health Service "has medically supported her PSL." (Dkt. 30-21, p. 1).
Plaintiff argues that Defendant "was aware that [her] absenteeism was related to her disability," and that periodic telecommuting would be a reasonable accommodation for that disability. (Dkt. No. 32, pp. 12, 7-11). Defendant argues that Plaintiff's testimony, taken as a whole, indicates that her "belief or hope that she could [reliably work from home] is merely speculation." (Dkt. No. 27-1, p. 21). Defendant cites, for example, Plaintiff's testimony that her migraines sometimes required her to lie down for extended periods of time, even when she was at home. (Dkt. No. 27-1, p. 21, citing Hampson Dep., pp. 91-92). There certainly is some question as to whether Plaintiff could consistently work during regular business hours; Plaintiff, however, affirmatively testified in her deposition that she would be able to work from home while experiencing migraines. (Hampson Dep., p. 92). Plaintiff testified that her migraines "are the worst" for the first few days and that she only sought to work on a "part-time basis" from home when her migraines were severe. [*31]  (Hampson Dep., p. 92, 94). Plaintiff also testified that her migraines are worsened by bright lights and noise, which could be eliminated at home. (Hampson Dep., pp. 90, 102-103). Plaintiff explained: "[I]f I am working from home, I don't have all that constant glare of the lights, I don't have all that background noise, so it would be easier. I would be able to complete my work better." (Hampson Dep., p. 102). Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, Plaintiff has submitted sufficient evidence to raise a material issue of fact regarding whether periodic working from home could have improved her attendance record and enabled her to perform the essential functions of her job despite her migraine symptoms.

d. Willingness to Grant Reasonable Accommodation/Engage in Interactive Process
Plaintiff has also submitted sufficient evidence to satisfy the fourth prong of the prima facie test. It is undisputed that Plaintiff asked Grant and Diaz about working from home. (Def. Reply SMF, ¶¶ 64-67; Hampson Dep., pp. 85-86), and that Grant and Diaz advised Plaintiff about State Farm's established accommodation request process. (Def. Reply SMF, ¶¶ 64-67; Hampson Dep., p. 87). The parties [*32]  dispute: (1) whether Grant and Diaz told Plaintiff that State Farm would not accommodate a request to work from home; and (2) whether Grant and Diaz told Plaintiff that she would lose her job if she requested the accommodation of working from home. (Diaz Decl., ¶¶ 15, 18; Hampson Dep., pp. 87-88). Defendant argues that Plaintiff chose not to pursue a reasonable accommodation and that Plaintiff refused to engage in the interactive process. (Dkt. No. 27-1, p. 15). However, in light of the factual dispute about what was said at Plaintiff's meeting with Grant and Diaz in the Spring of 2010 or July 2010, Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact regarding whether State Farm was responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process.
Plaintiff raised the possibility of working from home, on a periodic and as-needed basis, during her meeting with Grant and Diaz. Plaintiff's discussion about periodic work from home qualifies as a request for reasonable accommodation. An employee does not have to use any particular words in order to request an accommodation; it is enough, under both the ADA and the NYSHRL, for the employee to make the employer aware of his [*33]  or her disability and to ask whether an accommodation can be made. Brady, 531 F.3d at 135; E.E.O.C. v. C.R. England, Inc., 644 F.3d 1028, 1049 (10th Cir. 2011) (citing Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 174 F.3d 142, 158-59 (3d Cir. 1999)); Colwell v. Rite Aid Corp., 602 F.3d 495, 506-507 (3d Cir. 2010) (internal citations omitted); Phillips v. City of New York, 66 A.D.3d 170, 189, 884 N.Y.S.2d 369 (1st Dep't 2009), rev'd on other grounds, Jacobsen v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosps. Corp., 22 N.Y.3d 824, 838, 988 N.Y.S.2d 86, 11 N.E.3d 159 (2014); Miloscia v. B.R. Guest Holdings LLC, 33 Misc. 3d 466, 928 N.Y.S.2d 905, 915 (Sup. Ct. 2011) ("[U]nder the NYSHRL . . . an employer has an independent duty to reasonably accommodate an employee's disability if the employer knew or reasonably should have known that the employee was disabled, whether or not a specific request has been made.").
Once Plaintiff told Grant and Diaz that she wanted to work from home, the ADA and NYSHRL required State Farm to engage in a flexible, interactive process with her in order to determine whether it could make a reasonable accommodation that would allow her to perform her job duties. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3); N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(3)(a); see also McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 99 (2d Cir. 2009) ("[T]he ADA envisions an interactive process by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated.") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); Jacobsen, 22 N.Y.3d at 836 ("[W]here the employee seeks a specific accommodation for his or disability, the employer must give individualized consideration to that request and may not arbitrarily reject the employee's proposal without further inquiry.").
It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not pursue State Farm's interactive [*34]  process. State Farm argues that Plaintiff was responsible for the breakdown of the interactive process, and that she therefore cannot show that State Farm failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. (Dkt. No. 27-1, p. 15). "An employee who is responsible for the breakdown of that interactive process may not recover for a failure to accommodate." Nugent v. St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hosp. Ctr., 303 F. App'x 943, 946 (2d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff, however, testified that Grant and Diaz discouraged her from pursuing the accommodation request, (Hampson Dep., pp. 86, 95-96, 104-05), and that she never made a formal accommodation request because Grant "made it clear to me that if the assessment board determined that I needed to work from home, even on a part-time basis, I would not have a job because State Farm did not accommodate telecommuting." (Hampson Dep., p. 95-96.). Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable jury could find that State Farm's alleged refusal to consider telecommuting as a reasonable accommodation led to the breakdown of the interactive process. See Goonan, 916 F. Supp. 2d at 484 (holding that Plaintiff pleaded sufficient factual allegations to show that his employer failed to participate in the interactive process when it refused to consider telecommuting [*35]  as a possible accommodation); see also Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n, Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans With Disabilities Act ¶ 34 (Oct. 17, 2002), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html#N_101 (stating that an employer may need to allow an employee to work from home as a reasonable accommodation for that employee's disability). Thus, there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding which party was responsible for the purported breakdown of the interactive process.
Alternatively, there is a question of fact regarding whether State Farm's employees made comments which created an "objectively reasonable perception" that pursuit of the accommodation request process would be futile, and might even result in job loss. See Gile v. United Airlines, 213 F.3d 365, 369-70 (7th Cir. 2000) (excusing plaintiff's failure to bid for a new position through an established bidding system when the employer's medical director was aware of her medical issues but refused to consider any accommodations, told her to resign, and told her that her health issues sounded like "a personal problem, not an illness"); Bultemeyer v. Fort Wayne Cmty. Sch., 100 F.3d 1281, 1285-86 (7th Cir. 1996) (excusing a plaintiff's failure to specifically request an accommodation [*36]  after his supervisor told him that he "would not receive any more special treatment").
The futile gesture doctrine applies "in the rare case where an employer has essentially foreclosed the interactive process through its policies or explicit actions," (Davoll v. Webb, 194 F.3d 1116, 1133 (10th Cir. 1999)) including when an employer's statements about potential accommodations create "an objectively reasonable perception that the [interactive] process is clearly at an end."13Loulseged v. Akzo Nobel Inc., 178 F.3d 731, 739 (5th Cir. 1999).
Thus, Plaintiff has submitted evidence sufficient to establish, at the prima facie stage, the final element of the prima facie test.

e. Undue Hardship
Because Plaintiff stated facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claims unless it can establish as a matter of law that granting Plaintiff an accommodation would have caused an "undue hardship."14Rodal v. Anesthesia Grp. of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 121 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing Lovejoy-Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 221 (2d Cir. 2001)). "[T]o defeat a defendant/employer's motion for summary judgment," an employee "need only show that an 'accommodation' seems reasonable on its face, i.e., ordinarily or in the run of cases. Once the plaintiff has made this showing, the defendant/employer [*37]  then must show special (typically case-specific) circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship in the particular circumstances." U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-402, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002) (internal citations omitted). The ADA defines "undue hardship" as "an action requiring significant difficulty or expense, when considered in light of" factors including:
(i) the nature and cost of the accommodation needed . . . ;
(ii) the overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodation . . . ;
(iii) the overall financial resources of the covered entity . . . ; and
(iv) the type of operation or operations of the covered entity.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(10)(B).15
Defendant has not presented any argument or adduced any evidence on the issue of undue hardship. The Court therefore denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's failure to provide reasonable accommodation claim.

2. Discriminatory Discharge
In order to establish a prima facie case for discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff must establish: (1) that Defendant is subject to the ADA;16 (2) Plaintiff was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) Plaintiff was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, [*38]  with or without a reasonable accommodation, and (4) Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Brady, 531 F.3d at 134; Jacques v. DiMarzio, Inc., 386 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). If an employee establishes a prima facie case, "the employer must offer through the introduction of admissible evidence a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the discharge;17 and the plaintiff must then produce evidence and carry the burden of persuasion that the proffered reason is a pretext." Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing Heyman v. Queens Vill. Comm. for Mental Health for Jamaica Cmty. Adolescent Program, 198 F.3d 68, 72 (2d Cir. 1999)). Plaintiff can demonstrate that Defendant's stated reason for her termination was pretextual "either by the presentation of additional evidence showing that the employer's proferred explanation is unworthy of credence, or by reliance on the evidence comprising the prima facie case, without more." Sista, 445 F.3d at 173 (citing Heyman, 198 F.3d at 72)). For the purposes of this motion, the analysis of Plaintiff's NYSHRL discrimination claim is identical to the ADA analysis.18
As discussed above, Plaintiff has presented sufficient facts to establish that she has a disability, and that she is qualified to perform the essential functions of her job with a reasonable [*39]  accommodation. See supra sections IV(A)(1)(a), (c). Therefore, the remaining issue on this claim is whether Plaintiff met her burden of showing that suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability.
While Defendant asserted that Plaintiff's absences were the cause of her termination, if Plaintiff's absences were a manifestation of her disability they cannot be separated from the disability itself. See Teahan v. Metro-North C. R. Co., 951 F.2d 511, 516 (2d Cir. 1991) ("[A]n employer 'relies' on a handicap when it justifies termination based on conduct caused by the handicap."); Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 338 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that employee whose employment was terminated after he was unable to return to work following medical leave stated prima facie case of disability discrimination); Borkowski, 63 F.3d at 143 ("Failure to consider the possibility of reasonable accommodation for [a] disabilit[y], if it leads to discharge for performance inadequacies resulting from the disabilit[y], amounts to a discharge solely because of the disabilit[y]"); cf Rios v. Dep't of Educ., 351 Fed. Appx. 503 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that plaintiff could not establish prima facie case of disability discrimination when she "repeatedly failed to show up to work on time or at all for a variety of reasons, many of which were unrelated to her claimed disability") (emphasis added). [*40]  The Second Circuit has stated that courts need not reach the issue of pretext in discrimination cases where, as here, "the parties agree that the employer complains of conduct that is the direct result of the employee's disability." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 129 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing Teahan, 951 F.2d at 516)); see also Barnett v. Revere Smelting & Ref. Corp., 67 F. Supp. 2d 378, 392 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) ("[W]here an employer asserts excessive absenteeism as a non-discriminatory justification for an employee's termination, that justification cannot analytically be considered apart from the alleged disability causing the absenteeism.").
In this case, Plaintiff asserts that she was absent from work because of her medical issues, including her migraines. Diaz recommended that State Farm terminate Plaintiff's employment "for Job Requirements Not Met" as a result of her frequent absences which rendered her "unable to meet the expectations of a Claim Representative." (Dkt. No. 27-5, p. 98). Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Plaintiff was disciplined because of her disability. See McMillan, 711 F.3d at 129 ("McMillan was tardy because of his disability and . . . disciplined because of his tardiness. In other words, McMillan was disciplined because of his disability."). Thus, pretext for disability [*41]  discrimination is not an issue in this case, and the Court need not apply the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis. Id. (citing Teahan, 951 F.2d at 516)).19
Even if Plaintiff's disability and Defendant's alleged reason for termination were not so closely linked, summary judgment would still be inappropriate because Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that Defendant's alleged non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment was pretextual. In support of her pretext argument, Plaintiff points to the differences between Diaz's first and second drafts of his memorandum recommending termination of Plaintiff's employment. In the first draft, Diaz cited to Plaintiff's "serious medical condition;" her "medically supported" paid sick leave; her FMLA-protected sick days as well as her non-FMLA-protected absences and noted that "[s]he has recently become eligible to FMLA-protect a portion of her" paid sick leave. (Dkt. No. 30-21). In the second and final draft of the memorandum, Diaz removed all references to Plaintiff's FMLA-protected absences and did not mention her "serious medical condition." (Dkt. No. 30-22). A reasonable jury could infer pretext from [*42]  the differences between the first and second drafts of the termination memorandum. While the availability of additional FMLA-protected sick leave is not material to Plaintiff's discrimination claims,20 a reasonable fact-finder could infer an unlawful discriminatory motive from Diaz's reference to Plaintiff's medical condition and medically-supported leave, and conclude that State Farm's stated non-discriminatory reason for termination was pretextual.

B. Retaliation Claims
Plaintiff claims that State Farm terminated her employment in retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation, in violation of the ADA and NYSHRL. (Dkt. No. 32, p. 14). "Claims for retaliation are analyzed under the same burden-shifting framework established for Title VII cases." Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. 2002). Under this framework, "a plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of [retaliation]; it is then the defendant's burden to proffer a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions; the final and ultimate burden is on the plaintiff to establish that the defendant's reason is in fact pretext for unlawful [retaliation]."21Abrams v. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 764 F.3d 244, 251 (2d Cir. 2014) (Title VII) (citing Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 446 (2d Cir.1999)).
Plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing (1) that she engaged in protected activity under the ADA; (2) State Farm was aware of this activity; (3) State Farm took an adverse employment action against Plaintiff; and (4) a causal connection exists between the adverse employment action and the protected activity. See Summa v. Hofstra Univ., 708 F.3d 115, 125 (2d Cir. 2013); Treglia, 313 F.3d at 719.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity when she requested a reasonable accommodation, satisfying the first element of the ADA prima facie test. See Weixel v. Bd. of Educ., 287 F.3d 138, 149 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding that a request for accommodation constitutes a protected activity under the ADA). However, a request for reasonable accommodation is not a protected activity for purposes of a retaliation claim under the NYSHRL. Witchard v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., 103 A.D.3d 596, 596, 960 N.Y.S.2d 402 (1st Dep't 2013) (citing McKenzie v. Meridian Capital Grp., 35 A.D.3d 676, 677-78, 829 N.Y.S.2d 129 (2d Dep't 2006)). Plaintiff's NYSHRL retaliation claim therefore fails on the first prong of the prima facie analysis, and the remainder of the prima facie analysis applies only to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim.
As to the second and third prongs of the prima facie analysis, it is undisputed that State Farm was aware of Plaintiff's request for accommodation when Diaz, Grant and Plaintiff conferred in 2010, and that Plaintiff's termination [*44]  constitutes an adverse employment action. The parties dispute only the final element of the prima facie test: whether there is a causal connection between Plaintiff's request for accommodation and her termination.
Proof of causation "can be shown either (1) indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment, or through other circumstantial evidence such as disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in similar conduct; or (2) directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the plaintiff by [the defendant]." Goonan, 916 F. Supp. 2d at 485 (quoting Gordon v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000)). Plaintiff has not submitted any evidence of retaliatory animus, and instead relies on indirect evidence, alleging that her request for an accommodation was closely followed by increased disciplinary action, culminating in her termination in April 2011. (See Dkt. No. 32, p. 15; Hampson Aff., ¶¶ 38-39).

1. Timing of Plaintiff's Protected Activity
The parties dispute the timing of Plaintiff's request, a fact material to the causal connection prong of her retaliation claim, which depends on temporal proximity. Diaz asserted in his declaration that Plaintiff first requested a reasonable accommodation [*45]  in July 2010, during their meeting via telephone conference with a State Farm human resources representative. Plaintiff could not recall the specific date of this meeting in her deposition, only that it occurred in 2010. (Hampson Dep., p. 86). Plaintiff acknowledged, however, that she made her accommodation request during "a conference call" with Diaz and a human resources representative. (Hampson Dep., pp. 47, 85). In her verified complaint, Plaintiff asserted that she requested a reasonable accommodation in "the Spring of 2010." (Compl., ¶ 31).

2. Plaintiff's Alleged Evidence of Retaliation
Plaintiff argues that State Farm began a pattern of retaliation after she requested an accommodation. Plaintiff stated in her affidavit that she received "four 'write-ups' about [her] 'Reliability and Impact on Customer Service, Teamwork and Morale'" over the "five years prior to 2010." (Hampson Aff., ¶ 38). Plaintiff then stated: "In contrast in 2010, when I started to discuss the possibility of a reasonable accommodation . . . I was written up four times in one year." (Hampson Aff., ¶ 39). The record, however, does not reflect an increased pattern of disciplinary action. The record reflects a [*46]  long history of concern about Plaintiff's absences which predated Plaintiff's request for an accommodation. It is undisputed that Diaz met with Plaintiff regarding her frequent absences in July and August 2005, August 2006, January 2007, March 2007, November 2008, May 2010, and November 2010. (Def. Reply SMF, ¶¶ 22-35, 41-44, 53-57, 76-80). State Farm also gave Plaintiff performance reviews with low performance ratings and/or references to frequent absences in March 2007, March 2009, March 2010, and March 2011. (SMF, ¶¶ 36-39; 45-51, 81-84; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶¶ 36-39; 45-51, 81-84).
Plaintiff argued in her memorandum of law in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, that prior to the May 2010 memorandum regarding Plaintiff's absences, "Diaz had not issued a similar absenteeism memo for eighteen months." (Dkt. No. 32, p. 14). Plaintiff argued that "[t]his sudden urge for Diaz to discipline Hampson . . . demonstrates State Farm's retaliation." (Id.). However, the memoranda Diaz wrote to Plaintiff in May 2010 and November 2010,22 documenting the negative impact of her absences, were virtually identical to earlier August 2005, August 2006, January 2007, and November 2008, memoranda. ( [*47] See Dkt. No. 27-4, pp. 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, 43-44, 70-71; Dkt. No. 27-5, pp. 82-83).
In her affidavit, Plaintiff has also pointed to her lower performance evaluation as evidence of retaliation. (Hampson Aff., ¶¶ 42, 44). In March 2010, Plaintiff received a performance rating of "Level 2" (out of 3) for the 2009-2010 performance period. In March 2011, after having requested an accommodation, Plaintiff received a performance rating of "Level 1," the lowest possible score, for the 2010-2011 performance period. (SMF, ¶¶ 81-83; Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶¶ 81-83). Plaintiff alleged that the comments in both the 2010 and 2011 performance evaluations were positive. (Hampson Aff., ¶¶ 41-45). As she stated:
The 2011 [performance evaluation] states: "Dawn has documented her ability to meet the customer's needs during her telephone calls and in her file documentation. . . . Dawn is well versed in New York No-Fault, and she has been able to answer customer questions quickly and effectively. . . . Dawn is a productive and decisive claim handler. . . . From each of the team managers that Dawn has worked with the feedback I have received is that Dawn is decisive, and she evaluates claim files on a timely basis. [*48]  . . . The feedback that I have received is that Dawn performs a significant amount of medical management requests that they receive when Dawn is working with their team. Generally Dawn's work is accurate and follows calibrations. . . . I received an e-mail from one NY claim representative thanking Dawn for the work that she performed in their NY queue. This claim representative indicated that Dawn did an 'amazing' job. . . . Dawn has been able to work with several teams and support teach of those teams in reaching their time service goals. . . ."
(Hampson Aff., ¶ 42 (quoting Dkt. No. 27-5, pp. 92-93)).
The 2010 [performance evaluation]includes similar positive performance comments, such as: "When assistance was required in the Metro NY PIP section, Dawn was selected to provide assistance. . . . Dawn accepted her assignment without complaint, and was proactive in obtaining additional training and guidance to the changes in NY handling so that she could be successful in this new role. . . . Dawn is a productive claim handler, who is able to process work in volume."
(Hampson Aff., ¶ 45 (quoting Dkt. No. 27-4, pp. 64, 67)). Plaintiff stated that she believes "the reason [her] overall performance [*49]  was lowered from 'Level 2' to 'Level 1' was because of [her] request for a reasonable accommodation." (Hampson Aff., ¶ 46). But Plaintiff's belief is not supported by the evidence on the record, which shows that Plaintiff also received "Level 1" performance ratings in her 2007 and 2009 performance evaluations, long before she requested an accommodation. (Dkt. No. 27-4, pp. 25, Dkt. No. 27-3, ¶ 11). Furthermore, both the 2010 and 2011 performance evaluations contain comments about Plaintiff's poor attendance record,23 showing that Plaintiff's attendance was considered problematic both before and after her request for accommodation. Thus, the "Level 1" rating in Plaintiff's 2011 performance evaluation does not provide a sufficient basis from which a reasonable jury could conclude that State Farm retaliated against her because of her request for accommodation.
In addition, Plaintiff asserts that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that because her absenteeism actually improved in the months leading up to the termination of her employment, State Farm's disciplinary actions during this time period were therefore attributable to a retaliatory motive. (See Dkt. No. 32, pp. 14-15). These [*50]  assertions apparently come from Plaintiff's calculation of her "effective absentee rate" in different years. (Pl. Resp. SMF, ¶ 17). Plaintiff stated in her affidavit:
Prior to 2010, my average effective absentee rate was 16% based on the 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 Memoranda produced by State Farm employee, Diaz. After 2010, when I started to discuss the possibility of a reasonable accommodation with State Farm, my average effective absentee rate actually went down to 14.5% based on the four different 2010 Memoranda produced by Diaz.
(Hampson Aff., ¶ 37). Defendant takes issue with Plaintiff's calculations, arguing that they are flawed because Plaintiff divided "the number of absences reflected in the memoranda . . . — which explicitly address[] only . . . several months within each year — by all workdays in that year." (Def. Reply SMF, ¶ 17). As stated above, the Court finds that the calculation of Plaintiff's "effective absentee rate" is immaterial because there is no dispute regarding the validity of the memoranda's description of the number of days she was absent. See supra note 3. Moreover, in light of Plaintiff's numerous recorded absences in 2010,24 any alleged "improvement" in her [*51]  absenteeism rate in 2010 does not provide adequate evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that State Farm disciplined Plaintiff, and ultimately terminated her employment, out of retaliation for having requested an accommodation.

3. Length of Time Between Protected Activity and Termination of Employment
Whether Plaintiff's request occurred in the Spring of 2010, as she asserts, or July 2010, as Diaz asserts, the interval between her request for accommodation and her April 2011 termination is too long to support an inference of causal connection. Moreover, as discussed, there is no basis for construing the May 2010 memorandum, the November 2010 memorandum, the March 2011 evaluation, and the April 2011 termination as a retaliatory pattern. In fact, Defendant attempted to accommodate Plaintiff's disability in September 2010, after Plaintiff's protected activity, by assigning Plaintiff to a "floater" position, without a fixed caseload. (Def. Reply SMF ¶ 74).
While there is no bright-line rule for what interval of time may help to establish a causal relationship, "temporal proximity cannot support an inference of causal connection unless the retaliatory action and the protected [*52]  activity were 'very close' in time." Perry v. NYSARC, Inc., 424 Fed. Appx. 23, 26 (2d Cir. 2011) (citing Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001)). Here the span of at least nine months between the protected activity and the adverse employment action, not coupled with any additional evidence supporting an inference of retaliation, fails to establish causation. See Hollander v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 895 F.2d 80, 85 (2d Cir. 1990) (no causal connection between protected activity and adverse employment action that were three months apart); Khan v. Bank of Am., 572 F. Supp. 2d 278, 295 (N.D.N.Y. 2008), aff'd, 372 F. App'x 216 (2d Cir. 2010) (no causal connection where plaintiff was terminated six months after filing EEOC complaint); Clark v. N.Y. State Elec. & Gas Corp., 67 F. Supp. 2d 63, 77 (N.D.N.Y. 1999) (no causal connection between protected activity and termination almost nine months later).
The Second Circuit has stated: "Where timing is the only basis for a claim of retaliation, and gradual adverse job actions began well before the plaintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an inference of retaliation does not arise." Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance Am. Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir. 2001). As in Slattery, the final adverse employment action in this case came after "an extensive period of progressive discipline" that started long before Plaintiff engaged in any protected activity. See id.; see also McPhatter v. New York City, 378 F. App'x 70, 72 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that plaintiff could not establish a causal connection between protected activity and adverse employment action when she was "subject to escalating disciplinary [*53]  actions . . . well before she engaged in protected activity.") (internal citation omitted). This period of progressive discipline included numerous memoranda warning Plaintiff about her excessive absenteeism, as well as performance evaluations highlighting the impact Plaintiff's absences had on her work. Thus, Plaintiff has not produced sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find a causal connection between her request for accommodation and the termination of her employment.
Even if Plaintiff had stated a prima facie case of retaliation, her retaliation claims would fail because she proffered no evidence from which a reasonable jury could determine that State Farm's alleged legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating her employment (her excessive absences) was pretext for retaliation, or that her request for accommodation caused the termination decision.
Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff's third and fourth causes of action.
