FACTUAL BACKGROUND1

A. Marquez's Role at Cinelease
Cinelease hired Marquez as a Class C Driver in the Lighting and Grip Division of Cinelease on March 14, 2017. P-UMF ¶¶ 1, 107.2 Marquez was hired as a full-time nonexempt employee. P-UMF ¶ 2. When Marquez first started working for Cinelease, there were two Class C Drivers in the Lighting and Grip Division and two in the Expendable Division. P-UMF ¶ 6. There was a time when Marquez worked in both the Lighting and Grip Division and the Expendable Division. P-UMF ¶ 108. Around 2019, Marquez was transitioned to the Expendable Division. P-UMF ¶ 109.
Between March 17, 2017 and January 1, 2020, Cinelease lost several of its Class C Drivers, who for business reasons were not replaced. P-UMF ¶ 8.
Marquez never possessed a California Class A commercial driver's license during (or after) his employment with Cinelease. P-UMF ¶ 15.

B. Marquez's Injury and [*3]  FMLA Leave
In August 2021, Marquez sustained a non-work-related injury to his back. P-UMF ¶ 16. Specifically, Marquez sustained a back injury while working out. P-UMF ¶ 114. On August 16, 2021, he submitted a Disability Slip indicating he was unable to work from August 16, 2021 to September 16, 2021. P-UMF ¶ 17. Kristine Stephanyan, from Cinelease's HR department, responded by providing Marquez the proper leave of absence documentation to complete in order to commence his leave. P-UMF ¶ 18. Upon receipt of Marquez's Request for Leave of Absence and Medical Certification of Health Care Provider for FMLA, his leave of absence was approved through September 16, 2021. PUMF ¶ 19.
On September 15, 2021, Marquez requested an extension of his leave through October 14, 2021. P-UMF ¶¶ 20-21. On October 14, 2021, Marquez requested another extension through November 14, 2021. P-UMF ¶ 23. On November 12, 2021, Marquez submitted another leave extension request through December 12, 2021, which was also approved. P-UMF ¶ 24. On November 29, 2021, HR Business Director, Marlene L'Heureux emailed Marquez to inform him that he had exhausted his FMLA leave, but that Cinelease approved his request for leave [*4]  extension through December 13, 2021. PUMF ¶ 25. On December 8, 2021, Marquez responded to L'Heureux informing her that he was unable to return on December 13, 2021. P-UMF ¶ 26. In response, L'Heureux informed Marquez that Cinelease would work with him to accommodate him, but that due to the exhaustion of his protected time off, his inability to return may result in a location change, alternate position, or an end to the employment relationship. P-UMF ¶ 27. Marquez responded requesting another extension of his leave as an accommodation. PUMF ¶ 28.
Cinelease claims it approved Marquez's leave extension request, and two subsequent requests, seeking extensions through March 4, 2022. See L'Heureux Decl. ¶¶ 8-10. But Marquez testified at his deposition that Cinelease stopped responding to Marquez's requests after December 8, 2021. See Fund Decl., Ex. A (Marquez Depo.) at 269:24-271:20 [Doc. # 26 at 39].
On December 31, 2021, Cinelease promoted Marco Ruiz, a former warehouse worker, to the only Class C Driver position, which was formerly held by Marquez. P-UMF ¶ 41.

D. Marquez's Termination
On March 4, 2022, Marquez emailed L'Heureux indicating he was cleared to return to work with no restrictions [*5]  on March 7, 2022. P-UMF ¶ 35. On March 4, 2022, L'Heureux responded that because Marquez had been out since August, Cinelease would need to evaluate if any positions were available for Marquez. P-UMF ¶¶ 36, ¶ 125. On March 4, 2022, L'Heureux emailed Rivas and Stepanyan asking whether there was an open position for Marquez. P-UMF ¶ 126.
On March 8, 2022, Cinelease informed Marquez that he was terminated effective March 7, 2022, because his position was no longer available "in accordance with the provisions of protected leave." P-UMF ¶ 140.

III.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment should be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); accord Wash. Mut. Inc. v. United States, 636 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Nat'l Ass'n of Optometrists & Opticians v. Harris, 682 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248.
The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its initial burden, Rule 56(c) requires the nonmoving party to "go beyond the pleadings and by [his or] her own affidavits, or [*6]  by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e)); see also Norse v. City of Santa Cruz, 629 F.3d 966, 973 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) ("Rule 56 requires the parties to set out facts they will be able to prove at trial."). "In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). "Rather, it draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Id.

IV.

DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination in Violation of FEHA3
Under FEHA, "[i]t is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer, because of . . . physical disability. . . of any person, . . . to bar or to discharge the person from employment, . . . or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). Under FEHA, a disability may be temporary. See Ross v. Cty. of Riverside, 36 Cal. App. 5th 580, 595, 248 Cal. Rptr. 3d 696 (2019). "Physical disability" includes, but is not limited to, "[b]eing regarded or treated by the employer or other entity covered by this part as having, or having had, any physical condition that makes achievement of a major life activity difficult." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(m)(4). For disability discrimination, a "plaintiff [*7]  can establish a prima facie case by proving that: (1) plaintiff suffers from a disability; (2) plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability." Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 236, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997) (citing Morisky v. Broward County, 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996)) (footnote omitted).
California courts have adopted the three-part burden-shifting framework enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), for discrimination claims based on a theory of disparate treatment. Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). Under this test, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Id. If the plaintiff does so, a rebuttable presumption of discrimination arises, which shifts the burden to the employer to show that the adverse employment action was taken for a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason." Id. at 355-56. Legitimate reasons include those "that are facially unrelated to prohibited bias, and which, if true, would . . . preclude a finding of discrimination." Id. at 358. If the employer succeeds, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer's proffered reasons were pretext for a discriminatory motive. Id. at 356.
The McDonnell Douglas test does not apply to cases where there is direct evidence of discrimination. Glynn v. Sup. Ct., 42 Cal. App. 5th 47, 53, 254 Cal. Rptr. 3d 772 (2019). "Direct evidence is evidence which, if believed, proves [*8]  the fact of discriminatory animus without inference or presumption. Comments demonstrating discriminatory animus may be found to be direct evidence if there is evidence of a causal relationship between the comments and the adverse job action at issue." DeJung v. Superior Ct., 169 Cal. App. 4th 533, 550, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 99 (2008) (citing Trop v. Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc., 129 Cal. App. 4th 1133, 1146-1149, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 144 (2005)). "Thus, in disability discrimination cases, the threshold issue is 'whether there is direct evidence that the motive for the employer's conduct was related to the employee's physical or mental condition.'" Glynn, 42 Cal. App. 5th at 53 (quoting Wallace v. County of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 123, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (2016)). An employee can establish an employer's intent to discriminate by showing "(1) the employer knew that plaintiff had a physical condition that limited a major life activity, or perceived him to have such a condition, and (2) the plaintiff's actual or perceived physical condition was a substantial motivating reason for the defendant's decision to subject the plaintiff to an adverse employment action." Id. (quoting Wallace, 245 Cal. App. 4th at 129).
When an employer moves for summary judgment, however, "the burden is reversed . . . because the defendant who seeks summary judgment bears the initial burden." Lawler v. Montblanc N. Am., LLC, 704 F.3d 1235, 1242 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Dep't of Fair Emp't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011)). At the summary judgment stage, the moving defendant must provide sufficient evidence that "the plaintiff's action 'has no merit,' [*9]  i.e., that 'one or more elements . . . cannot be established' or [that] 'there is a complete defense,'" such as a nondiscriminatory, non-pretextual reason for the adverse employment action. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 356 (quoting Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 437c). Cinelease moves to dismiss the FEHA claims on both bases.

1. Whether There is Direct Evidence of Discrimination
Marquez argues that there is direct evidence of discrimination such that the McDonnell Douglas test does not apply. He points to evidence that Cinelease knew of his disability. P-UMF ¶ 66. Marquez also argues that L'Heureux had emailed him informing him that if he could not return to work on December 13, 2021, he could be subject to termination. P-UMF ¶¶ 115-117. In addition, Marquez further points out that L'Heureux testified that Cinelease would not have terminated Marquez had Marquez not taken his disability-related leave. P-UMF ¶ 141.
On reply, Cinelease argues that Marquez miscites portions of L'Heureux's deposition testimony to support his position. In addition, Cinelease contends that L'Heureux's November 29, 2021 email notifying Marquez of the exhaustion of his FMLA is not direct evidence of discrimination because it was statutorily required to give Marquez notice of FMLA exhaustion. [*10]  Reply at 3 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.300).
Here, the Court agrees that this is not direct evidence of discrimination, and is at best circumstantial evidence. The Court in Glynn found that the email terminating an employee that stated, "your employment has ended on 07/20/16, due to your inability to return to work by a certain date with or without some reasonable workplace accommodation" was direct evidence of discrimination based on mistaken belief that the employee was disabled. Glynn, 42 Cal. App. 5th at 54.4

2. Marquez Has Established a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination
On summary judgment, the Court construes evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Marquez argues that he has provided sufficient evidence for a prima facie case of disability discrimination. It is uncontroverted that Marquez suffered from a disability related to his back which affected his musculoskeletal system and limited his ability to work. P-UMF ¶¶ 16-24, 30-33, 114. Marquez was able to perform the essential functions of his position because he was released to work on March 7, 2022, without restrictions. P-UMF ¶ 35. And Marquez was subject to an adverse employment action, specifically termination, due to his disability because Cinelease explicitly [*11]  stated that Marquez's position was no longer available "in accordance with the provisions of protected leave." P-UMF ¶ 140. In essence, Marquez was terminated because he was unable to return to work within the statutory leave period. As Marquez has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to Cinelease to demonstrate evidence of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason.

3. Cinelease Had a Legitimate Nondiscriminatory Reason For the Adverse Employment Decision
Cinelease contends that Marquez was fired because there was no longer a position available for him. MSJ at 14. L'Heureux attests that Marquez's position had to be filled to meet business needs, and there were no other Class C driver positions at Cinelease. L'Heureux Decl. ¶ 12. Cinelease has therefore met its burden of showing a nondiscriminatory reason for Marquez's termination.

4. Marquez Has Shown That There is a Triable Issue Whether Cinelease's Reason is Pretext
Marquez argues that Cinelease's proffered reason for his termination is a pretext for discrimination. Marquez points out that Cinelease failed to show how holding his position open until his return would have resulted in an undue hardship to the company, and in fact [*12]  never made such an inquiry. P-UMF ¶¶ 123-124. Indeed, Cinelease was able to use another driver to temporarily cover for him without any hardship during the first three and a half months of his leave. P-UMF ¶¶ 122-124.5 In addition, Marquez contends that Cinelease could have placed Marquez in an open warehouse position, especially considering that Marquez had prior experience performing warehouse duties for Cinelease, and Cinelease cannot point to any qualifications that Marquez was missing for that role. P-UMF ¶¶ 110-113, 134-135. Cinelease also did not search for any positions for Marquez outside of its Los Angeles location. P-UMF ¶¶ 137.
In reply, Cinelease argues that it had certain rules to follow with regard to placing persons in positions for which they were qualified to work pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement ("CBA"). Reply at 4. While Cinelease provides the CBA as evidence, Cinelease does not ever actually explain what limitations the CBA imposed. See Reply at 5. Cinelease argues that it could not offer a position to Marquez if a position for which he was qualified to work did not exist at the time. Id. Whether Marquez was qualified to work [*13]  in another position and whether Marquez was deemed to be limited to certain positions due to classifications under the CBA are two separate disputed issues.
Here, Marquez has created a genuine dispute of fact as to whether the proffered reasons for his termination were pretext, given evidence indicating that Cinelease could have held his prior position open without undue burden or placed Marquez in another role for which he was qualified. Therefore, the Court DENIES Cinelease's MSJ with regard to Marquez's disability discrimination claim.

B. Retaliation in Violation of FEHA
California Government Code section 12940 prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee based upon the employee's request for a reasonable accommodation. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). A prima facie case of retaliation requires a plaintiff to show that "(1) he or she engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Scotch v. Art Institute of California, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1020, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (quoting Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005)). The McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting framework applies. Nelson v. United Tech., 74 Cal. App. 4th 597, 613, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 239 (1999).
Cinelease repeats the arguments above, namely that Marquez cannot provide evidence of the third element of his prima facie case because Cinelease [*14]  had a valid nonretaliatory reason for his termination. MSJ at 20. Cinelease further argues that temporal proximity alone does not satisfy the burden to show pretext. Id.
Marquez argues that there is a causal connection between his request for an accommodation under FEHA and the ADA and his subsequent termination in March. Opp. at 16. Marquez points to L'Heureux's deposition, where she stated that Cinelease had no plans to terminate Marquez had he not taken his leave. P-UMF ¶ 141. Additionally, when Marquez notified Cinelease that he could not return to work on December 13, 2021, and as an accommodation requested a leave of absence beyond twelve weeks, Cinelease took steps to fill his position and ceased communicating with him until he was cleared to return to work. P-UMF ¶¶ 41, 118, 119, 125-127, 140.
This evidence supports an inference that Cinelease decided to restructure Marquez's position after he submitted a further leave request after the expiration of his FMLA leave and went on leave. Suffering an adverse employment action one day or even a few months after protected activity can be sufficient to show a causal link for a prima facie case of retaliation. Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1020, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). Viewing the evidence [*15]  in the light most favorable to Marquez, Marquez has established all the elements of a prima facie case.
For the reasons stated above, however, Cinelease met its burden in showing a non-discriminatory reason for terminating Marquez's position shifting the burden back to Marquez. Nevertheless, Marquez satisfied his burden to demonstrate that the reason given for his termination was pretext. While Cinelease claims to have approved Marquez's requests for leave, Cinelease did not communicate these approvals to Marquez after December 2021 or respond to his post-December 2021 emails at all until he said he could return to work. As noted above, Cinelease has not explained why Marquez's position could not have been held open without undue burden or how the CBA prohibited Cinelease from placing Marquez in a Warehouse position.
Therefore, the Court DENIES Cinelease's MSJ as to retaliation.

C. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process and Failure to Accommodate
An employer and employee are required to engage in a "timely, good faith, interactive process" to find a reasonable accommodation. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n); see also Swanson v. Morongo Unified Sch. Dist., 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 971, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014), as modified on denial of reh'g (Dec. 23, 2014). Failure to properly engage in this process gives [*16]  rise to a cause of action. Swanson, 232 Cal. App. 4th at 971. The elements of a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process are: (1) the plaintiff has a disability or medical condition that was known to the employer, (2) the plaintiff requested that his employer make a reasonable accommodation for that disability so that he could perform his job duties, (3) the employer failed to participate in a timely, good faith interactive process with the plaintiff, and (4) the employer's failure to engage in a good faith interactive process was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's harm. Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 61, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006).
Relatedly, a plaintiff making a claim for failure to accommodate must prove that: "(1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 255-256, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). Additionally, a reasonable accommodation may include "reassignment to a vacant position." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p)(2).
Cinelease contends that these claims fail as a matter of law. With respect to the interactive process claim, Cinelease conclusorily contends that the evidence demonstrates that Cinelease fully engaged in the interactive process in good faith, from the moment it became aware [*17]  of his medical condition on August 16, 2021, until he was cleared to return to work with no restrictions on March 4, 2022, such that Cinelease complied with and completed its obligations under FEHA. MSJ at 17-18.
Marquez asserts that the interactive process broke down because of Cinelease. Specifically, Marquez points to evidence that Cinelease completely stopped corresponding with Marquez after he requested "additional leave time beyond the 12 weeks permitted under FMLA/CFRA as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA and FEHA." P-UMF ¶¶ 118, 119.
"[T]he interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984-985, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). Here, there is a dispute of material fact as to whether Cinelease actually continued to approve Marquez's leave requests, or ceased to communicate with Marquez after December 2021. Although Cinelease need not have held open Marquez's position indefinitely, if it had engaged in a good faith interactive process, it might have been able to determine approximately how long Marquez would need to be out and whether it could continue to use another driver temporarily in his absence. In addition, it is uncontroverted that there was an open warehouse [*18]  position at Cinelease at the time Marquez was terminated. P-UMF ¶¶ 130-132. It is also uncontroverted that Cinelease neither inquired whether Marquez was qualified for that position, nor conducted a search for open positions outside Los Angeles for which Marquez might be qualified. P-UMF ¶¶ 132-137. Since there is a dispute as to whether Cinelease provided the accommodation Marquez requested, and other evidence supports an inference that Cinelease did not engage in a good-faith exploration of other possible positions for which Marquez might have qualified, the motion for summary judgment is DENIED with respect to the failure to engage in the interactive process claim.
With respect to the failure to accommodate claim, Cinelease argues that it properly accommodated Marquez by extending his medical leave until he was qualified to return to work. According to Cinelease, when Marquez was qualified to return to work, he no longer required accommodation, and therefore his termination did not constitute a failure to accommodate him. Marquez has adduced evidence, however, that Cinelease, rather than extending his leave, in fact stopped communicating with him after December 8, 2021. Moreover, [*19]  it is uncontroverted that Cinelease did not hold his position open until his return. Accordingly, there is a dispute as to whether Cinelease actually provided the accommodation requested by Marquez: an extension of his leave.6 L'Heureux also testified that she did not conduct any inquiry into whether holding Marquez's position open for him would impose an undue hardship on Cinelease. P-UMF ¶¶ 134-135. This also counsels against summary judgment on Marquez's failure to accommodate claim. Therefore, summary judgment is DENIED as to the failure to accommodate claim.

D. Failure to Prevent Discrimination Claim
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). Under California law, a claim for failure to take corrective action cannot stand without an underlying claim for discrimination or harassment. See Trujillo v. N. Cnty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 288-89, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998).
Cinelease argues that, pursuant to Trujillo, Marquez was required to report the alleged discrimination at issue in this case to maintain a failure to prevent claim. But Trujillo does not support that proposition. Trujillo stands for the proposition that there can be no failure to prevent claim where there is no [*20]  finding of discrimination. Id. at 285, 286.
Cinelease otherwise contends that Marquez's failure to prevent claim fails because it is derivative of his other failed claims. Because the Court denies summary judgment on those other claims, the Court also DENIES Cinelease's MSJ on the failure to prevent claim.

E. Wrongful Termination
Marquez's wrongful termination claim is derivative of his claims for disability discrimination and medical leave retaliation. Because the Court denies summary judgment on those claims, the Court also DENIES Cinelease's MSJ on the wrongful termination claim.

F. Punitive Damages
Punitive damages are available where "proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a). A corporation may be held liable for punitive damages under California law only under the circumstances set forth in California Civil Code § 3294(b). Specifically, an employer is "not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages [*21]  are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(b). Furthermore, "[w]ith respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(b). "Managing agents" are employees who "exercise substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy." White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal.4th 563, 573, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999).
"Malice" is defined as "conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(c)(1). "Oppression" is defined as "despicable conduct subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2). "Fraud" is defined as "an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).
Cinelease seeks summary judgment on Marquez's punitive damages claims on the ground that they [*22]  fail as a matter of law because he has no evidence that any officer, director, or managing agent of Cinelease acted with, authorized, or ratified any oppression, malice, or fraud. Cinelease also contends that L'Heureux never engaged in any discriminatory or retaliatory conduct such that there is no evidence of malice. Finally, Cinelease argues that its non-discrimination policies also bar punitive damages under White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 563, 568 fn.2, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999).
At the hearing, Cinelease cited Scott v. Phoenix Sch., Inc., 175 Cal. App. 4th 702, 96 Cal. Rptr. 3d 159 (2009), and Ackerman v. W. Elec. Co., 643 F. Supp. 836, 857 (N.D. Cal. 1986), aff'd, 860 F.2d 1514 (9th Cir. 1988), in support of its argument that there is insufficient evidence for punitive damages. The Ackerman court's discussion of punitive damages is brief. Ackerman, 643 F. Supp. 836, 857 (N.D. Cal. 1986). There, the district court concluded "that defendant's actions having been unfounded, misguided and extremely ill-advised is not a sufficient basis for imposing punitive damages." Id. The California Court of Appeal in Scott held that "wrongful termination, without more, will not sustain a finding of malice or oppression." Scott, 175 Cal. App. 4th at 717. The Scott court pointed to situations where wrongful termination coupled with other misconduct did support punitive damages. For example, the court explained that the attempt "to hide the illegal reason for denying the promotion with a false explanation" constituted despicable [*23]  conduct in a gender discrimination case. Id. (citing Cloud v. Casey, 76 Cal. App. 4th 895, 903, 90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 757 (1999)). And in an age discrimination case, the court found oppression where a supervisor was involved in a campaign of unwarranted criticism of the plaintiff's job performance to justify a demotion. Id. (citing Stephens v. Coldwell Banker Com. Grp., Inc., 199 Cal. App. 3d 1394, 1398, 1403-1404, 245 Cal. Rptr. 606 (1988)).
While the Court draws all inferences in Marquez's favor, Cinelease has pointed to undisputed evidence that no one from Cinelease ever made any derogatory or discriminatory comments relating to Marquez's medical condition or leave. P-UMF ¶¶ 100-101. While Marquez argued that malice and oppression may be inferred from the circumstances of a defendant's conduct, Monge v. Superior Ct., 176 Cal. App. 3d 503, 511, 222 Cal. Rptr. 64, (1986), Marquez relies on the underlying alleged discriminatory conduct and not additional conduct. Accordingly, Marquez has not presented sufficient evidence to maintain his claim for punitive damages. Scott, 175 Cal. App. 4th at 717.
For these reasons, the Court GRANTS Cinelease's MSJ with regard to Marquez's claim for punitive damages.

V.

CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, Cinelease's MSJ is DENIED as to Marquez's disability discrimination, retaliation, failure to prevent, interactive process, failure to accommodate, and wrongful termination claims, but GRANTED as to his request for punitive damages.
IT IS [*24]  SO ORDERED.
