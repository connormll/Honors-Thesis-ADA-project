Opinion


ORDER ON MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff suffered from an incurable lung disease while working for Defendant. Defendant accommodated Plaintiff for years whenever Plaintiff expressly requested for accommodations. Plaintiff nonetheless accrued enough violations of Defendant's attendance policy, unrelated to her medical condition, to be terminated for absenteeism. Defendant allowed Plaintiff to remain employed despite these absences so long as she did not violate the policy again by accruing another unauthorized absence, which excluded absences due to her medical condition. Plaintiff then reported an absence as vacation despite knowing she did not have any vacation time remaining, and Defendant terminated her employment. Plaintiff now brings this disability discrimination suit arguing Defendant discriminated against her because her absence was actually due to her medical condition; [*2]  she accidentally reported it as unauthorized vacation; and she informed Defendant, for the first time, at her termination meeting that the absence was due to her medical condition.
Before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. [ECF No. 14]. As explained below, Plaintiff fails to create an issue of material fact with respect to key elements of her disparate treatment and reasonable accommodation claims. Defendant's motion is therefore GRANTED.
I. BACKGROUND
The material facts of this case are undisputed. See Pl.'s Response to Def.'s Statement of Material Facts, [ECF No. 17-1 at 1-19]; Def.'s Reply to Pl.'s Statement of Additional Facts, [ECF No. 18-1 at 1-13].
Defendant Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation is a meat processing and distributing company with approximately 2,300 employees. [ECF No. 17-1 at 1]. It maintains an attendance policy that requires employees to personally call in and report their absences and the reasons for those absences. Id. at 2-3. Reasons employees could identify include sickness, leave of absence, business, family and medical leave, vacation, or other. Id. at 3. The attendance policy imposes a point for each "unplanned" absence from work and every point accumulated [*3]  after the initial six results in disciplinary action. [ECF Nos. 14-5 at 2; 17-1 at 3]. The seventh point results in a first written warning; the eighth point results in a second written warning; and the ninth point results in termination. [ECF No. 17-1 at 3].
Plaintiff Sheena Lipp began working at Cargill in 1995. [ECF No. 18-1 at 1]. In 2000, she was diagnosed with eosinophilic granuloma, a rare and incurable lung disease that limits her ability to breathe or exert herself physically. Id. at 1-2. Lipp's limitations are especially apparent when she experiences "flare-ups." Id. at 2. As a result, at all relevant times, Lipp needed to attend three to four doctor visits per year and also take time off to address her flare-ups, which occurred two to four times per year and lasted two to four days each. [ECF Nos. 17-1 at 5-6; 18-1 at 2]. Additionally, Lipp could work only in a clean environment for eight hours per day, forty hours per week, with no work on Saturdays and Sundays. [ECF Nos. 17-1 at 5-6; 18-1 at 2]
Cargill knew of Lipp's medical condition and resulting work limitations. [ECF No. 18-1 at 3]. It accommodated Lipp for years whenever Lipp expressly requested for accommodations. [ECF No. 17-1 at 6]. [*4]  This included providing a clean environment; limiting Lipp's work schedule as needed; and allowing Lipp to visit her doctor and take time off for flare-ups. Id.
Wholly unrelated to Lipp's medical condition, on January 19, 2014, Lipp took an extended leave of absence for nine months to care for her ailing mother. Id. at 7. Lipp reported her absences every day and provided periodic doctor's notes indicating her need to take care of her mother. Id. at 7-8. Since this leave extended beyond Lipp's FMLA and employer-provided leave, such as vacation, it caused Lipp to elevate from 8 attendance points to 194.1 Id. at 8, 10-12. Upon her return to work on October 15, 2014, Cargill issued written warnings and a Last Chance Agreement to Lipp. Id. at 9-10. The agreement notified Lipp that she had already accumulated enough points for termination but, as a last chance, she would remain employed unless she made any additional unauthorized call-ins, late arrivals, or early departures from work.2 [ECF No. 14-8 at 1].
Upon being issued the Last Chance Agreement, Lipp informed her supervisor that she needed to attend an upcoming doctor's appointment related to her medical condition. [ECF No. 17-1 at 12]. Since the absence was for [*5]  an appointment related to her medical condition, Cargill authorized the absence and Lipp was not assessed an attendance point. Id. at 12-13. The appointment occurred within a week of receiving the Last Chance Agreement. Id. at 12 n.2.
On October 30, 2014, Lipp called to report another absence. Id. at 14. She admits citing "vacation" despite having no vacation time to use, but she contends that she did so accidentally by pressing the wrong button when reporting and that she actually experienced a flare-up instead.3 Id. Citing a breach of the Last Chance Agreement, Cargill terminated Lipp's employment on November 4, 2014, at which point Lipp, for the first time, informed Cargill that a flare-up caused her absence. Id. at 15-16. She then obtained a doctor's note on February 3, 2015, almost three months after her termination, indicating she called her doctor on October 30, 2014, to complain about trouble breathing.4 [ECF Nos. 17-3 at 26; 18-1 at 8].
Lipp sued Cargill in Iowa state court alleging, as one count, disability discrimination under both the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and the Iowa Civil Rights Act ("ICRA"). [ECF No. 1-1 at 3-6]. The parties have interpreted the petition as bringing both disparate treatment [*6]  and reasonable accommodation claims under the two laws. [ECF Nos. 14-2 at 4, 9; 17 at 3, 14]. Cargill removed the action to this Court on December 19, 2015. [ECF No. 1 at 1-3]. Present before the Court now is Cargill's Motion for Summary Judgment filed on March 15, 2017. [ECF No. 14]. The parties did not request oral arguments.
II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is proper when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Paulino v. Chartis Claims, Inc., 774 F.3d 1161, 1163 (8th Cir. 2014). "A dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that it could cause a reasonable jury to return a verdict for either party; a fact is material if its resolution affects the outcome of the case." Amini v. City of Minneapolis, 643 F.3d 1068, 1074 (8th Cir. 2011) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). Courts must view "'the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and giv[e] that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record.'" Pedersen v. Bio-Med. Applications of Minn., 775 F.3d 1049, 1053 (8th Cir. 2015) (quoting Johnson v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 744 F.3d 539, 541 (8th Cir. 2014)).
III. ANALYSIS
Lipp brings four disability discrimination claims against Cargill: (1) disparate treatment and (2) failure to reasonably accommodate under (3) the ADA and (4) the ICRA. [ECF No. 1-1 at 5]. Cargill seeks summary judgment on all claims. [ECF No. 14-2 at 2, 11]. The [*7]  parties do not dispute that disability claims under the ICRA are analyzed under the ADA framework; therefore, this Court's analysis will apply the ADA to all claims. [ECF Nos. 14-2 at 2 n.2; 17 at 3-4, 18]; Kallail v. Alliant Energy Corp. Servs., Inc., 691 F.3d 925, 930 (8th Cir. 2012); Gretillat v. Care Initiatives, 481 F.3d 649, 652 (8th Cir. 2007); Bearshield v. John Morrell & Co., 570 N.W.2d 915, 918 (Iowa 1997) ("Given the common purposes of the ADA and the ICRA's prohibition of disability discrimination, as well as the similarity in the terminology of these statutes, we will look to the ADA and underlying federal regulations in developing standards under the ICRA for disability discrimination claims."). For the following reasons, Lipp's disparate treatment and reasonable accommodation claims fail as a matter of law.

A. Disparate Treatment
"The ADA makes it unlawful for a covered employer to discriminate against any 'qualified individual on the basis of disability.'" Hill v. Walker, 737 F.3d 1209, 1216 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). "In disparate treatment cases, a similarly situated disabled individual is treated differently because of his disability than less- or non-disabled individuals" and the "key element is discriminatory intent." Peebles v. Potter, 354 F.3d 761, 766 (8th Cir. 2004). Such discrimination under the ADA may be proven through direct evidence or, alternatively, the "burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas and its progeny." Young v. Warner-Jenkinson Co., Inc., 152 F.3d 1018, 1021 (8th Cir. 1998); accord Fenney v. Dakota, Minn. & Eastern Railroad Co., 327 F.3d 707, 711 (8th Cir. 2003). The Court is unaware [*8]  of any direct evidence of discrimination, and Lipp does not argue through the direct-evidence approach. Accordingly, as a default, the McDonnell Douglas framework applies. See Young, 152 F.3d at 1021 ("Because Young has not put forth direct evidence of discrimination, his ADA claim is analyzed under the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas and its progeny.").
Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, "a discrimination plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination." Id. To do so under the ADA, the plaintiff must show that "(1) [she] is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) [she] is qualified to perform the essential functions of [her] job, with or without accommodation; and (3) [she] suffered an adverse employment action under circumstances from which an inference of unlawful discrimination arises." Id. at 1021-22. Establishing this prima facie case creates "a rebuttable presumption of discrimination," and "the burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." Id. at 1021. "If such reason is provided, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer's proffered reason is merely [*9]  a pretext for intentional discrimination." E.E.O.C. v. Prod. Fabricators, Inc., 763 F.3d 963, 969 (8th Cir. 2014). "The plaintiff retains at all times the ultimate burden of proving that the adverse employment action was motivated by intentional discrimination." Young, 152 F.3d at 1021.
Cargill presents three arguments: (1) Lipp cannot show she could perform the essential functions of her job; (2) she did not suffer an adverse action because of her disability; and (3) Cargill had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Lipp's employment. [ECF No. 14-2 at 1]. At the center of all three of these arguments is Lipp's "excessive absenteeism," which Cargill argues prevents Lipp from performing her job and led to her termination. Id. at 6, 8, 9.
The Court agrees with Cargill's latter two arguments. In Price v. S-B Power Tool, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit addressed facts similar to the case at hand and affirmed summary judgment for the employer. See 75 F.3d 362, 363-64, 366 (8th Cir. 1996). There, the employee suffered from epilepsy. Id. at 363. The employer maintained an attendance policy dictating that "an employee who violates the policy receives a verbal warning for the first offense, a written warning for the second offense, and termination for the third offense." Id. The employer also had "a practice [*10]  of granting leaves of absence, including medical leaves of absence, to any employee who requests them," and indeed had "never denied [the plaintiff-employee] her request for one." Id. at 364. But the employee accrued repeated absences without approval in violation of the attendance policy. Id. Some of these unauthorized or unapproved absences were due to the epilepsy and some were not. Id. The employer gave the employee warnings and instructed that she would be terminated unless she called "in to arrange for a leave of absence if she was going to miss any more days." Id. The employee then accrued two more absences without contacting her supervisor first and was terminated. Id. On the date of termination, the employee provided a doctor's note excusing her absence but the employer fired her anyway. Id. at 366. In affirming summary judgment for the employer, the Eighth Circuit held, on the facts above, the employee failed to show the termination "occurred under circumstances that would permit an inference of discrimination" and, even if a prima facie case existed, the employee "failed to come forward with any evidence of pretext" for the employer's reason for termination, absenteeism. Id. at 365. In asserting these [*11]  holdings, the court rejected the employee's argument that her two additional absences "should not have been counted against her absentee rate" given her doctor's note. Id. at 366. The court reasoned that the note was provided only at the date of termination, and the employee did not notify the employer in any way that "she would be absent at the time of her illness" as required by the attendance policy. Id.
Here, like in Price, Lipp cannot satisfy the third element of her prima facie case and, even if she could, she cannot show Cargill's proffered reason for her termination—absenteeism—was a pretext. Cargill has accommodated Lipp for years throughout her employment, including, as requested, limiting her work to forty hours per week, eight hours per day, with no work on Saturdays and Sundays, and allowing her to visit her doctor and take time off to address her flare-ups. Even when Lipp accumulated enough absence points unrelated to her condition for termination—a total of 194 points where only 9 result in termination—Cargill gave Lipp another chance so long as she was not absent again for an unauthorized reason, such as for vacation when she did not have vacation time to use. This is exactly [*12]  the reason Lipp communicated to Cargill on October 30, 2014: an absence for vacation when she did not have vacation time to use. By the time Cargill initiated the termination meeting with Lipp, it had already decided to terminate Lipp's employment because of her absence on October 30, 2014, and it was not aware at the time that the absence was due to Lipp's flare-up.5 It instead perceived Lipp's absence, as Lipp reported, as a day of unauthorized vacation. Thus, no reasonable jury could conclude that Cargill's decision to terminate Lipp's employment was on the basis of her disability, and therefore Lipp's disparate treatment claims under the ADA and ICRA must fail.

B. Failure to Reasonably Accommodate
"[A] claim against an employer for failing to reasonably accommodate a disabled employee does not turn on the employer's intent or actual motive." Peebles, 354 F.3d at 766. Since the "McDonnell Douglas line of cases . . . is aimed at fleshing out" discriminatory intent, "[r]easonable accommodation claims are not evaluated under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis. Rather, 'a modified burden-shifting analysis' is applied." Id. (quoting Fenney, 327 F.3d at 712).
Under the modified burden-shifting analysis, when a discrimination [*13]  plaintiff alleges she can perform the essential job functions with reasonable accommodation, she must make a facial showing that (1) she "has an ADA disability," (2) "[she] is a 'qualified individual'" under the ADA, (3) she "suffered [an] adverse employment action," and (4) "'a reasonable accommodation is possible.'" Brannon v. Luco Mop Co., 521 F.3d 843, 848 (8th Cir. 2008) (alteration in original) (quoting Fenney, 327 F.3d at 712). With respect to the second element, a qualified individual under the ADA is an employee who "possess[es] the requisite skill, education, experience, and training for [her] position" and is "able to perform the essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodation." Id. (quoting Fenney, 327 F.3d at 712). The burden then "shifts to the employer to show that it is unable to accommodate the employee." Id. (quoting Fenney, 327 F.3d at 712).
Here, an extensive analysis is unnecessary because Lipp fails to create an issue of material fact concerning a basic prerequisite to her reasonable accommodation claims. An employer does not impermissibly fail to accommodate an employee if the employer is not made aware, either expressly or impliedly, of the employee's request for accommodation before the employee is terminated. See Kowitz v. Trinity Health, 839 F.3d 742, 747 (8th Cir. 2016); Prod. Fabricators, Inc., 763 F.3d at 971; Mole v. Buckhorn Rubber Prods., Inc., 165 F.3d 1212, 1217-18 (8th Cir. 1999). To put it bluntly, an "employee cannot 'expect [*14]  the employer to read [her] mind and know [she] secretly wanted a particular accommodation and [then] sue the employer for not providing it.'" Mole, 165 F.3d at 1218 (alterations in original) (quoting Ferry v. Roosevelt Bank, 883 F. Supp. 435, 441 (E.D. Mo. 1995)). In Mole, for example, the employee requested specific accommodations on the date of her termination. Id. In affirming summary judgment for the employer, the Eighth Circuit characterized the employee's last-minute request as "a request for reinstatement, not a timely request for on-the-job accommodations." Id. Here, as in Mole, nothing made Cargill aware that Lipp's absence on October 30, 2014, was due to a flare-up deserving of an excused absence. Indeed, Lipp communicated to Cargill that it was for unauthorized vacation. And Lipp admits that she was terminated "at the beginning of that November 4, 2014, meeting," and only then "the conversation in that meeting quickly turned to [her] explanation" that the absence was actually due to a flare-up. [ECF No. 17-1 at 16]. Lipp further failed to provide a doctor's note substantiating her post-termination remarks until almost three months after the termination. This indicates Lipp's tardy explanation of her absence at her termination meeting was at best a request [*15]  for reinstatement, not a timely request for accommodation. Lipp's reasonable accommodation claims under the ADA and ICRA, then, fail as a matter of law.
IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Cargill's Motion for Summary Judgment, [ECF No. 14], is GRANTED. Plaintiff Sheena Lipp's disparate treatment and reasonable accommodation claims under the ADA and the ICRA are DISMISSED. The Clerk of Court shall enter judgment in favor of Defendant Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
