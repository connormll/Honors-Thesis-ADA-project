CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): ORDER RE DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [28]
Before the Court is Defendant Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (the "Motion"), filed on February 27, 2017. (Docket No. 28). Plaintiff submitted an Opposition on April 17, 2017, and Defendant's Reply followed on April 24, 2017. (Docket Nos. 34, 39). The Court has read and considered the papers filed on the Motion, and held a hearing on May 8, 2017.
The Motion is DENIED. Plaintiff has put forth sufficient evidence [*2]  to raise triable issues of fact with respect to each of her claims. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court concludes that Defendant's evidence does not conclusively show that Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of any vacant position that arose during her leave of absence. Central to this conclusion is the existence of vacancies in Department 127. While the Court will allow those vacancies to defeat summary judgment, the Court at the Final Pretrial Conference will scrutinize whether admissible evidence will be available at trial.
In addition, the Court ORDERS Plaintiff to show cause concerning a lack of certain disclosures, as discussed at the end of this Order.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff has been employed with Defendant since October 1995 as a Customer Service Agent ("CSA") at Los Angeles International Airport ("LAX"). (Plaintiff's Separate Statement of Genuine Issues of Material Facts ("PSGI"), Docket No. 36, ¶ 1). Plaintiff suffered a heart attack in April 2013. (Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("DSUF"), Docket No. 28-4, ¶ 5). As a result of the heart attack Plaintiff's doctor informed Defendant in June 2013 that Plaintiff [*3]  could not lift anything over 35 pounds. (Id. ¶ 2).
Following the heart attack, Plaintiff was provided with a leave of absence, which lasted until she was rehired in a different position in February 2016. (Id. ¶ 5). During this leave, Plaintiff received benefits, disability pay, workers' compensation benefits, and her seniority was not lost. (Id. ¶ 6). Even so, Plaintiff still made less than half of her normal salary during this time. (PSGI ¶ 50).
Plaintiff's prior position as a CSA in "Department 125" required frequent interaction with passengers and lifting/carrying of passengers' baggage. (DSUF ¶ 1). Delta CSAs work at several Departments inside LAX. Apart from Plaintiff's previous position at Department 125, there are CSA positions at Department 127 (the Sky Club), Department 120 (administrative area), and Department 118 (tower operations). (PSGI ¶¶ 60-62). Each of these positions requires varying degrees of lifting and carrying of heavy baggage. (Id.).
During the leave of absence, Plaintiff worked with Annelyse Greene, a member of Delta's Accommodations Program, to find another job at the company that could accommodate Plaintiff's lifting restrictions. (DSUF ¶ 11). Throughout her [*4]  leave, Plaintiff rejected openings that would require relocation. (Id. ¶ 12).
In September 2015, Plaintiff filed her original Complaint against Defendant in state court.
Ultimately, after the filing of the Complaint, Plaintiff and Greene found an opening in the Delta Sky Club at LAX that did not require any lifting in excess of Plaintiff's restrictions. (Id. ¶ 20). Plaintiff returned to work in February 2016 in that position, at which she remains. (Id.).
Plaintiff's operative First Amended Complaint was filed on October 14, 2016. (Docket No. 22).

II. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
Defendant objects to several statements in Plaintiff's Declaration, most importantly that some of her coworkers at her current position were hired during the period she was on a leave of absence.
The Court finds that none of the objections is convincing. Defendant's arguments are garden variety evidentiary objections based on, for example, lack of foundation, lack of personal knowledge, and hearsay. (Id.). While these objections may be cognizable at trial, on a motion for summary judgment, the Court is concerned only with the admissibility of the relevant facts at trial, and not the form of these facts as presented in [*5]  the Motion. See Burch v. Regents of Univ. of California, 433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1119-20 (E.D. Cal. 2006) (making this distinction between facts and evidence, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e), and overruling objections that evidence was irrelevant, speculative and/or argumentative); see also Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 2003) ("At the summary judgment stage, we do not focus on the admissibility of the evidence's form. We instead focus on the admissibility of its contents.").
As the Court only relies on admissible, material facts, the individual objections raised here are OVERRULED. See id. at 1119 ("[A]ttorneys routinely raise every objection imaginable without regard to whether the objections are necessary, or even useful, given the nature of summary judgment motions in general, and the facts of their cases in particular.").
The Court notes that whether a job opening existed is crucial to Plaintiff's claims, as discussed below. The statements of Plaintiff's coworkers are likely hearsay if introduced only through Plaintiff's testimony. The statements must be introduced for the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that the job opening existed) and the Court does not perceive any obvious hearsay exceptions. They may be introduced, however, through the testimony of those coworkers themselves. Cf. Wilson v. Stein Mart, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120658, 2016 WL 4680008, at *2 (M.D. Tenn. Sept. 7, 2016) ("Hearsay is not generally considered on a motion for [*6]  summary judgment, but it may be considered if the statement could be reduced to admissible evidence at trial or reduced to admissible form."). In addition, the Court is mindful that an opposition to summary judgment "seeks only to demonstrate that a question of fact remains for trial," Birch, 433 F. Supp. 2d at 1121, and that as a result courts should "treat the opposing party's papers more indulgently than the moving party's papers," Lew v. Kona Hosp., 754 F.2d 1420, 1423 (9th Cir. 1985). Because the hearsay problem in Plaintiff's Opposition can be cured at trial, the Court will consider the statements when ruling on the Motion.

III. LEGAL STANDARD
In deciding motions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, the Court applies Anderson, Celotex, and their Ninth Circuit progeny. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "The moving party initially bears the burden of proving the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Where the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only prove that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case. Where the moving party meets that burden, the burden then shifts to the [*7]  non-moving party to designate specific facts demonstrating the existence of genuine issues for trial." Coomes v. Edmonds Sch. Dist. No. 15, 816 F.3d 1255, 1259 n.2 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010)). "When the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at trial, 'it must come forward with evidence which would entitle it to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial.'" Miller v. Glenn Miller Productions, Inc., 454 F.3d 975, 987 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co. v. Darden Restaurants, Inc., 213 F.3d 474, 480 (9th Cir. 2000)).
Once the moving party comes forward with sufficient evidence, "the burden then moves to the opposing party, who must present significant probative evidence tending to support its claim or defense." C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co., 213 F.3d at 480 (quoting Intel Corp. v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 952 F.2d 1551, 1558 (9th Cir. 1991)). "A motion for summary judgment may not be defeated, however, by evidence that is 'merely colorable' or 'is not significantly probative.'" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50.
The Court has a duty to evaluate the evidence independently when it decides a dispositive pre-trial motion. Credit Managers Ass'n of S. California v. Kennesaw Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 25 F.3d 743, 749 (9th Cir. 1994). The Court must grant summary judgment if it ultimately determines that no rational or reasonable jury might return a verdict in the nonmoving party's favor based on all the evidence. James River Ins. Co. v. Hebert Schenk, P.C., 523 F.3d 915, 920 (9th Cir. 2008).

IV. ANALYSIS
Plaintiff brings several claims under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act. Cal. Government Code § 12940, et seq. Her claims are for disability discrimination, failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, failure to engage in the interactive process, failure to maintain a discrimination-free [*8]  environment, and retaliation. (First Amended Complaint, Docket No. 22). Plaintiff previously raised a race discrimination claim, but she has dropped that claim. (Opposition at 3 n.1).

A. Disability Discrimination

1. Legal Standard
Under FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer "to bar or to discharge [a] person from employment" on the basis of a disability. Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a). "California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination" under Title VII. Parks v. Bd. of Trustees of California State Univ., 813 F. Supp. 2d 1182, 1193-94 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (citing Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000); Metoyer v. Chassman, 504 F.3d 919, 941 (9th Cir. 2007)).
Under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), claims of employment discrimination must be evaluated as follows:
[P]laintiffs must first establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination. Noyes v. Kelly Servs., 488 F.3d 1163, 1168 (9th Cir. 2007). If plaintiffs establish a prima facie case, "[t]he burden of production, but not persuasion, then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action." Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trs., 225 F.3d 1115, 1123-24 (9th Cir. 2000). If defendant meets this burden, plaintiffs must then raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether the defendant's proffered reasons for their terminations are mere pretext for unlawful discrimination. Peterson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 358 F.3d 599, 603 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994).
Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., Inc., 615 F.3d 1151, 1156 (9th Cir. 2010).
It is Plaintiff's burden to show a prima facie case [*9]  of disability discrimination. To meet this burden, "the plaintiff must, at a minimum, show the employer took actions from which, if unexplained, it can be inferred that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a prohibited discriminatory criterion." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1004, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). To make out a prima facie case here, Plaintiff must show that (1) she suffered from a disability; (2) she was otherwise qualified to do her job or a different job that would not have required a promotion; and, (3) she was subjected to an adverse employment action because of her disability. See Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 345, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008).
"[A] plaintiff's burden is much less at the prima facie stage than at the pretext stage." Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., Inc., 615 F.3d 1151, 1158 (9th Cir. 2010). "This initial burden is not meant to be an 'onerous' one, but is designed merely 'to eliminate at the outset the most patently meritless claims, as where the plaintiff is not a member of the protected class or was clearly unqualified.'" Horne v. Dist. Council 16 Int'l Union of Painters & Allied Trades, 234 Cal. App. 4th 524, 533, 183 Cal. Rptr. 3d 879 (2015), reh'g denied (Mar. 17, 2015) (quoting Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 354-55).
Once a plaintiff meets this initial burden, the defendant must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action. After this showing, the plaintiff must prove that the proffered reason is merely a pretext for discrimination. The plaintiff [*10]  may prove pretext in two ways: "(1) indirectly, by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is 'unworthy of credence' because it is internally inconsistent or otherwise not believable, or (2) directly, by showing that unlawful discrimination more likely motivated the employer." Id. at 1170 (emphasis in original). Whether direct or indirect, all of the evidence of pretext should be considered cumulatively. Id.

2. Analysis
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not met her initial burden because (1) she cannot show that she is a qualified individual with a disability; and (2) there is no evidence of an adverse employment action.
As to whether an adverse employment action occurred, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that she had made an adequate showing. Plaintiff was put on a leave absence for over two years. Plaintiff has submitted evidence that during this leave she received less salary than she had while employed. Defendant fails to point to a case holding that an extended leave of absence does not qualify as an adverse employment action. Some federal cases have held otherwise. See, e.g., Tysinger v. Police Dep't of City of Zanesville, 463 F.3d 569, 573 (6th Cir. 2006) ("Here, the district court correctly determined, for purposes of summary judgment analysis, that defendant, [*11]  by denying Tysinger accommodating work within her restrictions and requiring her to take an extended leave of absence, partly without pay, subjected her to an adverse employment decision."); cf. McCoy v. Pac. Mar. Ass'n, 216 Cal. App. 4th 283, 307, 156 Cal. Rptr. 3d 851 (2013) ("California courts look to federal court interpretations of Title VII as a guide to interpreting FEHA provisions.").
In addition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not a qualified disabled individual because her lifting restrictions prevented her from performing an essential function of her job. Defendant cites a letter from Plaintiff's doctor, written shortly after the heart attack, in which the doctor states that Plaintiff told him she was required to lift bags while working. (Exhibit B to Declaration of Annelyse Greene Sanders, Docket No. 28-3). In addition, Defendant asserts that "all of the Department 125 CSA assignments have the very real possibility that the CSA agent will be required to assist a passenger with their luggage." (Reply at 3). Thus, Defendant argues, Plaintiff was incapable of performing her duties as a CSA in Department 125.
But this narrow focus on Department 125 is inappropriate here. The California courts have held that the proper question is whether an employee can [*12]  "with or without accommodation, . . . perform the essential functions of an available vacant position that would not be a promotion." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 963, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (emphasis added). So whether or not Plaintiff could perform the functions of a Department 125 CSA does not conclusively decide her claim here. Plaintiff must prove there was a vacant position for which she could have qualified, but that Defendant did not provide to her due to her disability. Id.
Here, one relevant vacant position is a Department 127 CSA in the LAX Sky Club—the exact position Plaintiff now holds. The Court concludes that Plaintiff was qualified for this position throughout her leave of absence based on the fact Defendant hired her for this position in February 2016 even though her lifting restrictions had never changed. The question, then, is whether the position was vacant during the leave of absence. Plaintiff points to recent statements made to her by three current coworkers in Department 127 that they were hired during Plaintiff's leave of absence. (PSGI ¶ 85). These statements create the obvious implication that vacancies—at least three—existed during Plaintiff's leave, such that her leave should not have lasted for as long as it [*13]  did. While Plaintiff's recitation of the statements in a declaration is obviously hearsay, the Court has already dealt with Defendant's evidentiary objections to the statements above. The statements at least raise a triable issue as to whether the position was vacant during the relevant time period, and the statements could be introduced in a non-hearsay fashion at trial. The Court rejects Defendant's contention that "there is no evidence of any open, available position for which [Plaintiff] was qualified that was denied to her." (Reply at 5).
Thus, Plaintiff has met her prima facie burden. In response, Defendant asserts a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for keeping Plaintiff on an extended leave of absence: Plaintiff could not perform an essential function of her job due to the lifting restrictions placed on her by her doctor. Plaintiff has, in response, put forth only indirect evidence of pretext. The record lacks any direct evidence of discrimination based on Plaintiff's disability. Plaintiff asserts in her Opposition that discriminatory animus can be inferred from "Defendant's unexplainable refusal to look beyond Department 125 in order to place Plaintiff in alternative employment." [*14]  (Opposition at 19). But as Defendant points out, this statement cannot be true because Defendant ultimately did hire Plaintiff for a position outside of Department 125. In addition, the evidence shows Greene offered Plaintiff other positions outside of Department 125 throughout her leave of absence, including positions in the cargo call center. (Greene Decl. ¶ 11-12).
Plaintiff's indirect evidence consists of the availability of the Department 127 position and Defendant's withholding of that opportunity from Plaintiff until her rehiring in late 2015 (after the filing of her Complaint in state court). Defendant's stated reason for keeping Plaintiff on the leave of absence is "internally inconsistent" if the position existed and was vacant because Plaintiff qualified for the job and it would not have been a promotion. While the facts are not entirely clear, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that she has created triable issues of fact as to whether Defendant intentionally withheld the Department 127 position despite its being vacant, and whether that decision was motivated by Plaintiff's disability: See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147-48 (2000) (discrimination "may well be the most likely" explanation after the employer's explanation [*15]  is eliminated, allowing for a prima facie case).
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED with respect to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim.

B. Failure to Provide a Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiff's second claim is for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation under California Government Code section 12940(m). The requirements for a claim under section 12940(m) mirror those of section 12940(a), discussed above, in the disability context. "[A]n employer is liable under section 12940(m) for failing to accommodate an employee only if the work environment could have been modified or adjusted in a manner that would have enabled the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 975. Because the Court has already concluded triable issues exist with respect to Plaintiff's section 12940(a) claim, the Court likewise concludes that summary judgment is inappropriate on Plaintiff's claim under section 12940(m). See id. at 978 ("As we concluded when addressing the section 12940(a) claim, on this record, there is a triable issue of fact about whether Nadaf-Rahrov was able to perform the essential functions of an available vacant position at Neiman Marcus with or without accommodation. Therefore, there is a triable issue about whether Neiman Marcus failed to reasonably accommodate her by reassigning her to such a position.").
Accordingly, [*16]  the Court DENIES the Motion with respect to Plaintiff's second claim.

C. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Plaintiff's third claim is for failure to engage in the interactive process, in violation of California Government Code section 12940(n). Section 12940(n) makes it unlawful "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Id. (quoting Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n)). "[S]ection 12940(n) imposes liability only if a reasonable accommodation was possible." Id. The plaintiff bears the burden of showing such an accommodation was possible. Id. at 984. "When a claim is brought for failure to reasonably accommodate the claimant's disability, the trial court's ultimate obligation is to isolate the cause of the breakdown and then assign responsibility so that liability for failure to provide reasonable accommodations ensues only where the employer bears responsibility for the breakdown." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
Defendant's Motion argues that summary judgment is appropriate [*17]  on this claim because Plaintiff has failed to show that a reasonable accommodation was available at the time the interactive process was taking place. (Motion at 12). As detailed above, however, the Court concludes that a triable issue remains regarding whether a vacant position existed that would accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions. Therefore, Defendant's only argument on this claim is rejected. Here, a triable issue remains as to whether a "breakdown" in the interactive process occurred when Greene failed to communicate that openings existed in Department 127 for which Plaintiff would be qualified. If a jury determines that such a failure was not motivated by bad faith or discriminatory animus, then it will be free to find for Defendant. But the Court cannot say that no triable issue exists at this time. See Yeager v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 944 F. Supp. 2d 913, 924 (E.D. Cal. 2013) (denying summary judgment on claim under section 12940(n) because plaintiff had shown that available positions existed for which he would have been qualified).
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED with respect to Plaintiff's third claim.

D. Failure to Maintain a Discrimination-Free Environment
Plaintiff's fourth claim is for failure to maintain a discrimination-free environment, in violation of [*18]  California Government Code section 12940(k). "An actionable claim under section 12940, subdivision (k) is dependent on a claim of actual discrimination." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1021. A plaintiff seeking to recover on a failure to prevent discrimination claim under FEHA must show that (1) he was subjected to discrimination; (2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination; and (3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm. See Lelaind v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 576 F.Supp.2d 1079, 1103 (N.D. Cal. 2008). The causation element of a section 12940(k) claim requires the plaintiff to show that the discriminatory conduct was a "substantial factor" in causing his harm. See Alamo v. Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp., 219 Cal. App. 4th 466, 480, 161 Cal. Rptr. 3d 758 (2013). "A failure to prevent discrimination claim is essentially derivative of a discrimination claim." Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 804 (N.D. Cal. 2015) ("As discussed above, Achal pleaded sufficient facts to support his claims of both disability and religious discrimination. Achal has therefore adequately pleaded the requisite foundation of discrimination required for a section 12940(k) claim."). The Court concludes that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether Defendant took reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination here. See Lelaind, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 1103 ("As already discussed above, Lelaind has come forth with sufficient evidence to overcome summary judgment with respect to her disparate treatment and retaliation claims under [*19]  FEHA. Moreover, because genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether defendants took reasonable steps necessary to prevent unlawful conduct, the court DENIES defendants' motion as it pertains to the FEHA claim under section 12940(k).").
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion with respect to Plaintiff's fourth claim.

E. Retaliation
Plaintiff's fifth claim is for retaliation in violation of California Government Code section 12940(h). FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(h). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show "(1) he or she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). If a plaintiff can meet this burden, the defendant must come forward with some legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for its actions. As with Plaintiff's discrimination claim, she may show by indirect evidence that Defendant's explanation [*20]  for any conduct is merely pretext. See Winarto v. Toshiba Am. Elecs. Components, Inc., 274 F.3d 1276, 1284 (9th Cir. 2001) ("Pretext may be shown either (1) directly by persuading the jury that a discriminatory motive more likely than not motivated the employer or (2) indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.").
Defendant primarily argues that Plaintiff cannot show any adverse employment action. As discussed previously, the Court rejects that contention. Plaintiff's FAC alleges that she engaged in a protected activity when she exercised and asserted her rights under FEHA as a disabled individual. (FAC ¶ 45). In her Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the protected activity was her attempt to return to work. (Opposition at 24). Merely "[n]otifying one's employer of one's medical status, even if such medical status constitutes a 'disability' under FEHA" because "it does not constitute engaging in opposition to any practices forbidden under FEHA or the filing of a complaint, testifying, or assisting in any proceeding under FEHA." Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 247, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016). Asking for an accommodation, however, is a protected activity. See Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 990 ("Nadaf-Rahrov produced evidence that she asked for an accommodation for her disability in January 2004, which was protected activity, [*21]  and that she was fired in July 2004.").
Here, Plaintiff produces evidence that she did more than simply notify Defendant about her disability. In fact, she asked for an accommodation, which qualifies as a protected activity under FEHA. Her extended leave of absence began when she requested an accommodation, and such a "temporal nexus" can establish the causal element. See id. (citing Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Int'l, 151 Cal. App. 4th 1102, 1112, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007)).
Although Defendant does not say so expressly in its Motion, the Court assumes that Defendant's legitimate explanation for the leave of absence is, again, that no accommodation was possible. As with Plaintiff's discrimination claim, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has submitted indirect evidence raising a triable issue concerning this fact. Summary judgment is thus inappropriate here.
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED with respect to Plaintiff's fifth claim.
In addition, the Court ORDERS Plaintiff to show cause, in writing no later than May 22, 2017:
(1) the precise dates that each of the three coworkers hired during Plaintiff's leave of absence were hired (at the hearing, counsel correctly noted that the names of the three coworkers were provided in the PSGI, ¶ 85);
(2) when Plaintiff became aware that [*22]  these three coworkers had been hired during her leave of absence; and
(3) why these names were not disclosed to Defendant during the normal Rule 26 disclosures, and instead were revealed for the first time in Plaintiff's Opposition papers.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
