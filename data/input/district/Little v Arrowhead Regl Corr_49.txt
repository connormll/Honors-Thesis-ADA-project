Opinion


ORDER
I. Introduction
This matter came before the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge pursuant to the parties' consent, see, Title 28 U.S.C. §636(c), upon the Motion of the Defendant Arrowhead Regional Corrections ("ARC") for Summary Judgment on all of the claims in the Amended Complaint.1 A Hearing on the Motion was conducted on May 6, 2010, at which time, the Plaintiff Jay Richard Little ("Little") appeared by Paul Lelii, Esq., and ARC appeared by Gary W. Bjorklund, Assistant St. Louis County Attorney. For reason which follow, we grant the Motion, and dismiss the Amended Complaint with prejudice.
II. Factual and Procedural Background
ARC removed this action from Minnesota State Court on August 20, 2009. See, Docket [*2]  No. 1. In his Amended Complaint, Little claims a violation of Minnesota Statutes Section 181.932 (the "Whistleblower Act" or "MWA"); a violation of Minnesota Statutes Section 363A.01, et seq., (the "Minnesota Human Rights Act" or "MHRA"); and a violation of Title 42 U.S.C. §12101, et seq., (the "Americans with Disabilities Act" or "ADA"), arising from Little's discharge from his employment with ARC, as a Probation Officer, on August 13, 2008. As to his MWA claim, Little alleges that ARC terminated his employment in response to his reports to his superiors, that ARC was illegally collecting fees from probationers, without regard to their ability to pay, or to the actual cost of services provided, in violation of Minnesota Statutes Section 244.18. See, Amended Complaint, Docket No. 1-5 at pp. 6 of 8.2
In addition, Little asserts a claimed violation of the ADA and MHRA, and alleges that ARC failed to grant him reasonable accommodations, or the opportunity to participate in the interactive process in good faith. Id. at pp. 6-7 of 8. The Amended Complaint seeks compensatory damages, and costs, pursuant to Minnesota Statutes Sections 181.935, and 363A.01, and the ADA, and he also asks for reinstatement. Id. at p. 8 ¶¶1-4. On March 24, 2010, ARC filed its Motion for Summary Judgment, as to all of Little's claims. See, ARC's Motion for Summary Judgment, Docket [*3]  No. 19.
In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, ARC contends, first, that Little has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, pursuant to the MWA, because his conduct did not constitute a "report" under the Act. ARC also argues that the claim fails, because the statutory violation, that Little contends he reported, is not actually a violation, and that, in any event, Little's reports were insufficiently specific to satisfy the statutory standard. See, ARC's Memorandum in Support of Motion ("ARC's Memo"), Docket No. 21, at pp. 11-14 of 22. ARC also contends that Little has failed to establish any adverse employment action because, after he was terminated, ARC offered Little a settlement agreement on September 30, 2008, which would have reinstated him, but which he refused.3 Id. at pp. 14-15 of 22. ARC also contends that Little has failed to demonstrate any causal connection, between his reported violations, and his termination, and that ARC had a legitimate, non-pretextual reason to terminate his employment. Id. at pp. 15-17 of 22.
As to the claims that Little raises under the ADA and MHRA, which are related to the alleged discrimination based upon a disability, ARC argues that Summary [*4]  Judgment in its favor is appropriate, because Little has failed to establish an adverse employment action, has failed to establish a causal relationship which could demonstrate any discriminatory intent, has failed to raise a reasonable inference that ARC did not engage in the interactive process in good faith, and because ARC had a legitimate, non-pretextual business reason for terminating Little's employment. Id.at pp. 17-22 of 22; ARC's Reply, Docket No. 42, at p. 6 of 13. Notably, ARC does not dispute that Little is disabled, under the ADA or the MHRA and, for these purposes, we assume, without deciding, that Little is disabled.
ARC has submitted excerpts from the depositions, and related Exhibits, of Thomas Roy ("Roy"), who is the director of the ARC; of Little; of Bruce Michon ("Michon"), who was Little's direct supervisor; of Terry Fawcett ("Fawcett"), who replaced Michon as Little's direct supervisor; and of Kay Arola ("Arola"), who is the Head Probation Officer, and who sent the termination letter of August 13, 2008. See, Affidavit of Gary W. Bjorklund ("Bjorklund Aff."), Docket No. 22, Exhibits A-E; Deposition of Jay Little ("Little Depo."), Second Affidavit of Gary W. Bjorklund ("Second [*5]  Bjorklund Aff."), Docket No. 43. ARC has also submitted the Affidavit of Roy. See, Affidavit of Thomas Roy ("Roy Aff."), Docket No. 23. ARC contends that those depositions, and the submitted Exhibits, demonstrate that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to any of Little's claims, and that, therefore, ARC is entitled to Judgment in its favor as a matter of law.
In opposition to ARC's Motion, Little has submitted the transcripts of the entire depositions of Richard Brenner ("Brenner"), who is on the ARC Board; Kelly Hartlieb ("Hartlieb"), who works in Employee Relations for St. Louis County; Roy; Michon; Fawcett; Arola; Mark McCarthy ("McCarthy"), who is an ARC Probation Officer; Dorie Campbell ("Campbell"), who is an Administrative Specialist at ARC; and Patrice Little ("Little"), who is Little's wife; along with what appear to be all of the deposition exhibits. See, Affidavit of Paul Lelii ("Lelii Aff."), Docket No. 34. In addition, Little has submitted an email from Leah Shalde to Fawcett, Melissa Honkola ("Honkola"), who works in the St. Louis County Employee Relations Department, and Roy, which is dated April 15, 2008, and which discusses information received from Little's [*6]  physician concerning Little's "dual diagnosis," and to which is attached a draft letter, that was never sent, and that requested the physician to estimate a "return-to-work date," apparently related to a request pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). See, Email of April 15, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-1, Exhibit A, at pp. 3-4 of 4. Little has also submitted his own Affidavit, with attached Exhibits. See, Affidavit of Jay R. Little ("Little Aff."), Docket No. 33.4
In his deposition, Roy testified that "many probation officers don't like to collect fees," and that "it's a very common complaint." Deposition of Thomas Roy ("Roy Depo."), Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, Exhibit A, at pp. 1-2 of 32. In his Affidavit, Roy avers that ARC began collecting fees in 1998, and that ARC "surveyed other agencies around the state to determine what fees other agencies were collecting and how they were being collected." Roy Aff, Docket No. 23, at p. 1 ¶4. Roy attests that ARC established a fee system that is "consistent with most other agencies in the state," id., and that ARC initially [*7]  imposed a yearly fee, but later switched to a flat fee, which was based upon the offense level, and that, at all times, indigent probationers could request fee waivers. Id. According to Roy, the fees that ARC collected made up approximately five (5) percent of the ARC budget, and the majority of the ARC budget went to services. Id. at p. 2 ¶5.
With respect to their reasons for terminating Little's employment, as related in the termination letter that Arola sent to Little on August 13, 2008, ARC determined that Little had been absent from work for more than three (3) consecutive business days, without a valid excuse, and that, under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (the "Agreement"), such absences constituted a voluntary resignation. See, Termination Letter, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 32 of 32, ARC 285;5 Collective Bargaining Agreement, Article 23, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, Exhibit A, at p. 6 of 32, ARC 594.
The letter of August 13, 2008, followed a series of communications between Little, employees of ARC, and the Board, during the Spring and Summer of 2008. The parties do not dispute that those communications occurred largely by letter, with the exception of one (1) in-person [*8]  meeting, between Little and Fawcett on July 2, 2008, and one telephone message, which was left by Fawcett, for Little, on or about July 31, 2008. In pertinent part, we summarize those communications to provide a context to the issues before us.
On April 4, 2008, Little requested a leave of absence, pursuant to the FMLA, which was approved on April 9, 2008, retroactively commencing on March 20, 2008, and continuing for a period of twelve (12) weeks -- ending on June 12, 2008. See, Roy Aff., Docket No. 23, supra at p. 2¶6. In support of the FMLA leave, Little submitted the Certification of his Health Care Provider, which was completed on April 8, 2008, and in which his provider states that Little had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, that both were chronic conditions, and that Little had suffered from intermittent depression and overwhelming anxiety for decades. See, Certification of Health Care Provider, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-14, at pp. 46-49 of 79; ARC 184-187; and pp. 50-51; ARC 188-89 (FMLA Application). The provider also noted that "[t]he nature of [Little's] psychiatric problems is fluctuating," and that the latest increased episode of depression and anxiety began [*9]  around March 20, of an illegible year, which presumably was 2008. Id. at p. 46 of 79; ARC 184. In addition, the provider wrote that he was unable to give an estimate of how many treatment visits would be required, and there is no estimate of the duration of the illness. Id. at p. 47 of 79; ARC 185.
On June 4, 2008, as the end of his FMLA leave neared, Little sent a letter to Honkola, in which he expressed dissatisfaction with the handling of his affirmative action complaint, and requested an immediate leave of absence, so that his pending Minnesota Department of Human Rights complaint could be resolved, apparently related to his allegation of discrimination, retaliation, harassment, and "the manipulation of process and testimony by ARC management." See, Little Letter of June 4, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at p. 18-19 of 68; ARC 235-36. In that letter, Little explained that it was not in his best interest to return to ARC until the investigations had been completed. Id. On that same day, Fawcett responded to Little's letter, and denied his request for a leave of absence, due to "current staffing issues/concerns." See, Fawcett Letter of June 4, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at p. 20 of 68; ARC [*10]  237. On June 10, 2008, Little responded to Fawcett's denial of his request, and asked that the request be put to the ARC Board, and he related that the request for leave was "not only due to disputed employment issues currently being evaluated by other external agencies on [his] behalf, but also due to [his] personal health and well being." See, Little Letter of June 10, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at pp. 23 and 24-25 of 68; ARC 240 and 241-42.
On June 13, 2008, Fawcett sent a letter to Little, in which he informed Little that the Board would hear his request on June 20, 2008, he asked for medical documentation, due to Little's reference to his "personal health and well-being," and he related that ARC would allow Little to use sick leave benefits through June 20, 2008, after his FMLA leave expired on June 13, 2008, and that Little would need to submit medical documentation to use sick leave after June 20, 2008. See, Fawcett Letter of June 13, 2008, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 8 of 32; ARC 243. Thereafter, Roy sent a letter on June 16, 2008, which informed Little that his sick leave would be authorized through June 27, 2008, but that he would need to send in additional [*11]  medical information if he would not be able to return to work after that, because of medical reasons. Roy Letter of June 16, 2008, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1. at p. 9 of 32; ARC 245.
On June 20, 2008, Little sent a letter to Roy, in response to Roy's letter of June 16, 2008, in which he stated that he requested "to be granted a leave of absence[,]" "not only due to disputed employment issues currently being evaluated by other external agencies * * * but also due to [his] own health and well being." See, Little Letter of June 20, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at p. 30 of 68; ARC 247. The letter goes on to relate that Little "desire[d] to have a leave of absence due to medical issues and for the pending determination of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and/or other agencies." Id. Little also wrote that he felt "that the nature of some of the issues and concerns I have voiced in the past are potentially more of that for the State Attorney Generals [sic] Office or the U.S. Justice Department," although he did not specify what those issues and concerns were. Id.
On June 20, 2008, Roy sent Little a letter, informing him that the Board had denied his request for personal [*12]  leave, and that his "medical leave status" remained open "pending further update" from Little's medical provider. See, Roy Letter of June 20, 2008, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 10 of 32; ARC 246. On June 30, 2008, Little responded to Roy, and requested an appeal of the Board's decision, and also wrote that, "[i]n regards to any medical concerns * * * [he] had two (2) medical appointments last week," but that he did "not desire to share any further medical information," and that he requested his leave of absence "due to [his] opinion of the adversarial attitude and actions against [him] by Arrowhead Regional Corrections Management while [he had his] pending Minnesota Department of Human Rights Complaint being evaluated." See, Little Letter of June 30, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at p. 33 of 68; ARC 250. In closing, Little wrote that "again, [he] request[ed] a leave of absence," and that the leave was to be "for a period of up to one year." Id. at p. 34 of 68; ARC 251. On June 30, 2008, Roy responded in a letter, in which he wrote that the Board's decision to deny Little Personal Leave was final, and could not be appealed, and that, if Little did not provide the required medical [*13]  documentation, his further absences would be unexcused. See, Roy Letter of June 30, 2008, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 11 of 32; ARC 252.
Little met with Fawcett in the ARC office on July 2, 2008, where Fawcett told him that ARC needed medical documentation, and that, because he had not submitted a medical release to return to work, he was not considered to be at work that day, was on unexcused absences, and Fawcett further stated that he could not speak more to Little on that subject because the situation was "adversarial," see, Deposition of Terry Fawcett ("Fawcett Depo."), Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-6, at pp. 58-59, and 66 of 71, which caused Little to have a panic attack, and forced him to leave and seek medical intervention. See, Little Aff., Docket No. 33, at p. 6 ¶28. Little avers that, during the meeting on July 2, 2008, Fawcett "refused to discuss [Little's] work status or accommodations." Little Aff., Docket No. 33, at p. 6 ¶28.
Also on July 2, 2008, Little sent a letter to Roy, in which he requested "a leave of absence," Second Little Letter of July 2, 2008, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 15 of 32; ARC 257, and Little also submitted a short-form note from [*14]  his physician, which was dated July 2, 2008, and which contained the boilerplate language, that Little was "unable to work at this time," but provided no estimated duration for his illness, nor any narrative explanation. Id. at p. 14 of 32; ARC 256.
On July 9, 2008, Fawcett sent a letter to Little, informing him that his sick leave would be exhausted on Friday, July 11, 2008, that he would be authorized to use vacation time until the next Board meeting on July 18, 2008, and that Little could "submit a request for a Disability Leave to the Board, with thorough and supporting documentation from [Little's] medical provider pursuant to the union contract (Article 22, Sect. 4, Subd. C) prior to that date," and that the provider needed to "establish that [Little] suffer[ed] from an 'extended illness or injury,' rendering [him] unable to work, and justify the requested duration of any Disability Leave." See, Fawcett Letter of July 9, 2008, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 16 of 32; ARC 260. Fawcett also wrote that, in the absence of a request for Disability Leave, Little was expected to return to work on July 21, 2008, and that he would need to bring a release to work from his medical provider, with any [*15]  restrictions listed. Id.
On July 17, 2008, Little sent a letter to Fawcett, in which he wrote as follows:
In regards to your July 9 2008 letter, you indicated in same that I can submit a request for disability leave to the board, with through [sic] and supporting documentation from my medical provider pursuant to the union contract (Article 22, Sect. 4, Sudb. c) prior to that date.
Please note my prior requests for Personal Leave (Article 22, Sect. 4, Subd. f.) Also please note my July 2, 2008 letter to my health care providers requesting support for my personal leave of absence. Additionally followed by their provided documentation of the same date for which a copy was faxed to the Director, Mr. Roy only, due to my concerns of medical and data privacy issues.
* * *
As I have also previously indicated concern over ARC releasing my past private medical data to a third party without my permission or authorization * * * [and as] there has been no release or disclosure of this data to anyone but myself, I desire to not release any private medical data that is not absolutely necessary by law (FMLA).
Thus my prior request continues for the personal leave of absence that I have also requested and submitted by [*16]  medical care providers documentation dated July 2, 2008.
Should this continued request find for some reason not to be able to be given disposition at your ARC board meeting on July 18 2008, I would propose the use of any paid accruals, (vacation, comp. time, personal leave) instead of threatening me with unexcused absences that will be dealt with as per your contract with your union accomplices, until the ARC Board's next availability to fairly deal with my request.
Little Letter of July 17, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at pp. 44-45 of 68; ARC 261-62 [emphasis added].
On July 18, 2008, Roy sent a letter to Little, informing him that the Board had denied his second request for a Personal Leave, and that Little had not submitted sufficient documentation from his medical provider for Disability Leave, and that Little was expected to return to work on July 21, 2008. See, Roy Letter of July 18, 2008, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 17 of 32; ARC 263.
On July 23, 2008, ARC attorney Dale Harris ("Harris") wrote to Union Representative Welles that, if Little was seeking Disability Leave, he needed to submit a clear request for that leave, and that ARC interpreted the contract provision [*17]  to "require[] some supporting documentation from a treatment provider establishing that the employee suffers from an injury or illness rendering him/her unable to work, and the estimated duration of that condition." See, Harris Email from July 23, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-19, Exhibit 75, at p. 58 of 66; ARC 894.6 Harris also wrote that he had attached an updated FMLA certification form, and that Little could fill out that form, in order to make a clear request for Disability Leave, which should include an estimated duration, but that, if the treatment provider could not estimate a duration, that ARC "would request a re-certification or suitable status update every 30 days." Id.
On July 28, Fawcett sent a letter to Little, which related that Little had exhausted his sick leave, but had been allowed to use five (5) additional days of vacation time, following a conversation with Welles, in order to return to work on July 28, 2008, but that ARC had not received any further communication from Little. See, Fawcett Letter of July 28, 2008, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 18 of 32; ARC 264. The letter also stated that ARC would approve the use of vacation time through August 1, [*18]  2008, but that Little would need to report for work on August 4, 2008, "unless [ARC] receive[d] a proper request for disability leave with supporting documentation." Id.
On July 29, 2008, Little responded to Fawcett's letter, and stated that he had gone to a recent medical appointment and had medical documentation, and asked whether he should ask to have his leave request be heard before the Board. See, Little Letter of July 29, 2008, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 19 of 32; ARC 265. The Record contains another short-form boilerplate note from Little's psychiatrist, that advises that Little was "unable to work at this time," that is dated July 30, 2008, and that ARC contends was submitted with Little's letter of August 13, 2008, and not before -- a contention that is supported by the note's location, in Little's submissions to the Court, directly following that letter. See, July 30, 2008 Medical Update, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at p. 65 of 68; ARC 282; ARC's Reply Memorandum, Docket No. 42, at p. 8 of 13. Little contends that he sent the provider's note at the end of July of 2008. Hartlieb testified that ARC received no medical documentation from Little, other than the [*19]  two (2) short-form boilerplate notes. See, Deposition of Kelly Hartlieb ("Hartlieb Depo."), Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-3, at pp. 34-35 of 84.
On July 31, 2008, Fawcett sent a letter to Little which stated that Little's two (2) requests for "personal leave" had been denied, and that, if Little was "requesting Disability Leave, [Little] must make a request indicating that [he was] in fact requesting a Disability Leave for XX months and attach a statement from [his] doctor supporting it," and that the Board would hear such a request on August 15, 2008. See, Fawcett Letter of July 31, 2008, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 21 of 32; ARC 267 [emphasis in original]. Fawcett also encouraged Little to call him with any further questions, but noted that written communication was fine, and informed Little that, if he did not submit a request for Disability Leave, he was expected to return to work on August 4, 2008, with a release from his doctor to full duty, or a request for working accommodations. Id. On July 31, 2008, Little responded to a telephone message that Fawcett had left, asking for Little to contact him. Little asked for clarification as to whether Fawcett wished to meet with [*20]  him, together with a personal representative. See, Little Letter of July 31, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at p. 51 of 68; ARC 268.
On August 1, 2008, Little sent a letter to ARC's Board Members, and carbon-copied a number of people, including the Commissioners of the Counties that participate in ARC, and Roy. See, Little Letter of August 1, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at pp. 52-56 of 68; ARC 269-73. In that letter, Little makes a number of accusations related to his less-than-favorable 2007 performance evaluation, which was completed by Michon, against whom Little had filed a Union grievance, an Affirmative Action complaint, and a Minnesota Department of Human Rights complaint, which was related to purported violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Title 29 U.S.C. §1181, et seq.("HIPAA"),7 acts of alleged retaliation and discrimination, and which further states as follows:
* * * When questioned multiple times of who the HIPPA compliance officer is, I again did not receive this information and I am further instructed that there has been no documented release of my private medical records as required by data privacy/HIPPA. Thus the concern about releasing any [*21]  further private medical data on myself.
I therefore request to continue on any remaining paid accruals (vacation/comp. time) followed by a personal leave of absence with physician support for one year or until this situation can be resolved fairly and appropriately either through other agency involvement or other reasonable resolution/means of settlement.
If I am being coerced and forced into the only acceptable option for the same exact outcome or I can assume to expect further negative consequences, then you can classify it as a disability request for one year.
Id. at p. 54 of 68; ARC 271 [emphasis added].
There was no medical documentation submitted with Little's letter of August 1, 2008.
On August 4, 2008, Little sent a letter to Fawcett, in response to Fawcett's letter of July 31, 2008, in which Little advises that he will only contact or meet with Fawcett in the company of a personal representative, and references the letter to the Board of August 1, 2008, "in regards to [his] leave of absence request." See, Little Letter of August 4, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at pp. 57-58 of 68; ARC 274-75. In addition, Little wrote that he planned [*22]  to "await the decision as indicated in [his] August 1, 2008 written correspondence." Id. at p. 58 of 68; ARC 275. On August 7, 2008, Fawcett replied to the letters of August 1, and August 4, 2008, and he notified Little that his requests to use any remaining paid accruals were denied, that his two (2) requests for Personal Leave had been denied by the Board, and he also responded to Little's statement that ARC or the Board could "classify" his request as for Disability Leave as follows:
Arrowhead Regional Corrections is not forcing or coercing you to do anything. If you believe you qualify for Disability Leave, then you have the right to request it pursuant to Article 22 of the contract. Attached is a request form to assist you in doing so if that is your desire. If you do not wish to request Disability Leave, or do not believe you qualify, then you are expected to return to work immediately. ARC has not authorized ANY benefit use after August 1st, 2008. Accordingly, you have been in an unauthorized absence status since August 4, 2008.
Fawcett Letter, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at p. 59 of 68; ARC 276.
Fawcett attached a simple blank form, with an open space for the number of months requested, [*23]  and a statement that medical documentation was attached. Id. at p. 61 of 68; ARC 278. Between August 7, 2008, and August 13, 2008, there were no further correspondences between Little and ARC's representatives.
On August 13, 2008, Arola sent the letter that informed Little that he had been deemed to have resigned, due to his unexcused absences, and that his employment was terminated. See, Termination Letter, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at p. 32 of 32, ARC 285. The individuals who participated in deciding to terminate Little's employment were Roy, Arola, Fawcett, Hartlieb, Harris, and Brenner.8 See, ARC's Answer to Interrogatory No. 6, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-9, Exhibit 15, at p. 232 of 247.
Also on August 13, 2008, Little sent a letter to Fawcett, in which he wrote that his "request [was] to utilize any paid accruals, i.e. vacation/comp/sick leave while a physician has supplied medical documentation," and he questioned why he was told that his only option was to request a Disability Leave. See, Little Letter of August 13, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-15, at p. 62 of 68; ARC 279. Little also wrote that he was "of the opinion that questionable practices and situations have occurred that potentially [*24]  violate statute, policy and ethics," but that the Board was aware of his concerns, since he had previously notified them, and that it seemed "quite apparent that the ARC Board also is willing to manipulate data/information as indicated by the Board Chair during the July 18 2008 board meeting on the budget and the use from the, I believe close to 3 million dollar 'reserve fund' (probation fees) and a concern to avoid legal issues that could be exposed by the State Auditor." Id. at pp. 63-64 of 68; ARC 280-81. Little attached the two (2) short-form notes from his physician, dated July 2, and July 30, 2008. Id. at pp. 65-66 of 68.9
Fawcett testified that, when the decision-makers considered Little's employment termination, Little's complaints about fees, and HIPAA violations, were not discussed. See, Fawcett Deposition, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-4, Exhibit D, at p. 3 of 3. Arola also testified in her deposition that the decision-makers met to discuss strategies to get Little back to work, that Little's complaints were "never a part of any of the discussions," and that "[t]he decisions and the discussions always centered around the benefit time and medical or non-medical issues and leave requests," in response to Little's [*25]  numerous letters, see, Deposition of Kay Arola ("Arola Depo."), Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-5, Exhibit E, at pp. 3, and 4-5 of 5, although the decision-makers did "ponder" what Little meant, when he referred to himself as a whistleblower. See, Arola Depo., Affidavit of Paul L. Lelii, Docket No. 34-7, at pp. 35-36 of 81.
In addition, both parties have submitted the portion of the Agreement that relates to Disability Leave. See, Collective Bargaining Agreement, Article 22, Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 22-1, at pp. 3-6 of 32; ARC 591-94; see also, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-8, Exhibit 1; at p. 25-28 of 191. The pertinent paragraph is brief, and states that a leave of absence of up to one (1) year "shall be granted to any permanent employee who, as a result of an extended illness or injury, has exhausted his/her accumulation of sick leave." Id. at p. 5 of 32; ARC 593. The paragraph does not specify how a Disability Leave is to be requested, other than the introductory paragraph for all leaves of absence, which provides that "[a]ll requests for a leave of absence shall be submitted in writing by the employee to the employee's immediate supervisor," and that "[t]he request shall state the reason for [*26]  and the anticipated duration of the leave of absence." Id. at p. 3 of 32; ARC 591. The Agreement also provides that Personal Leave is subject to the ARC management's discretion. Id. at p. 5 of 32; ARC 593.
In his Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment, Little contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to ARC's reason for terminating Little's employment, due to the temporal relationship between Little's letters in 2008, and particularly in August of that year, which he characterizes as reports of illegal conduct under the Whistleblower Act, and his termination on August 13, 2008. See, Little's Memorandum in Opposition ("Little's Memo"), Docket No. 31, at pp. 31-32 of 45. Little also contends that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether ARC failed to reasonably accommodate Little for his mental disabilities, failed to properly engage in an interactive process, under the requirements of the ADA, and violated the MHRA by terminating Little's employment for allegedly discriminatory reasons. Id. at pp. 40-44 of 45.
With respect to the Whistleblower Act claim, there is no dispute that ARC does not complete individual assessments of probationers' abilities to pay, and that the [*27]  fees are assessed per offense, and not per service, which Little argues is a violation of Minnesota Statutes Section 244.18, Subdivision 2. In addition, Little contends that, although ARC had a process in place to allow indigent probationers to apply for waivers of the probation fees, ARC encouraged the Probation Officers not to inform the probationers of that option, and did not grant waivers when probationers applied for them,10 although he does not specify who, when, or in what manner, ARC made such encouragements, other than by denying waivers.11 See, Little Aff., Docket No. 33, at p. 3 ¶13, p. 4 ¶16; p. 5 ¶20 (based upon McCarthy's statements).
Little also points to ARC Meeting Minutes of July 17, 2007, which relate that "[w]e are no longer forgiving fees," and that, "[i]f they appeal, the answer will always be 'NO,'" and that "[a]ll unpaid fees will be sent to Revenue Recapture." See, Meeting Minutes of July 17, 2007, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-19, Exhibit 66, at p. 31 of 66; ARC 1358. Little also points to the ARC Meeting Minutes of October 28, 2008, which was more than two (2) months after Little was terminated, and which related that two (2) employees had looked into reviewing [*28]  the fees, but that it was determined to leave them as they had been, and that "[s]upervisors were asked to discourage Agents from counseling probationer[s] with regard to these fees: they owe what they owe." See, Minutes from October 28, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-19, Exhibit 67, at p. 33 of 66; ARC 2889.
Further, Fawcett testified that ARC had no written policy, with respect to fee waivers, and that he sometimes granted waivers or forgave fees, based upon the information that was given to him by the Probation Officers, but that such requests could also be referred to the Chief Probation Officer, see, Fawcett Depo., Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-6, at p. 35 of 71, and he also testified that, at a meeting that appears to have taken place on May 15, 2008, a subcommittee, which was looking into the probation fees, listed "consistency" as one of its agenda items to discuss. Id. at pp. 34-35 of 71.
Little attests that he reported violations of Minnesota Statutes Section 244.18, beginning in 2003, orally to Michon until April of 2007, and orally to Fawcett starting in April of 2007, as well as in emails and in other writings. See, Affidavit of Jay R. Little ("Little Aff."), Docket No. 33, at pp. 2-3 ¶8, p. 3 ¶11, p. 4 ¶15; p. 5 ¶21. Little [*29]  avers that his final "report" was on August 13, 2008, id. at p. 3 ¶11, and p. 7 ¶34, which is the same day as the date of the Termination Letter.
According to Little, ARC knew he was making "whistleblowing" reports, related to the fee collections and, in support, he emphasizes the Performance Review, that Michon completed on May 16, 2007, with respect to Little's work activities, in which Michon noted that Little had "expressed a philosophical disagreement with ARC's policy on assessing client's [sic] correctional fees," but was satisfactorily following the policy. See, Performance Review, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-19, Exhibit 65, at p. 16 of 66; JL 0367. Fawcett also testified that he knew that Little had brought up his concerns with respect to the fees issues, see, Fawcett Depo., Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-6, at p. 19 of 71, as did Hartlieb. See, Hartlieb Depo., Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-3, at pp. 57 and 82 of 84.
With respect to what Little terms the "phantom DWI program" which, he asserts, assessed probationers fees for services that they were not receiving, Little avers that he made reports, sometime during the time period between 2003 and 2005, related to that program, that he was terminated [*30]  in April of 2005, and was reinstated thereafter. See, Little Aff., Docket No. 33, at p. 4 ¶18. He underscores meeting minutes, from a meeting that appears to have taken place on or around April 16, 2003, which relate that "[i]ssues have arisen in Carlton County as the Judges are wanting intensive probation services provided essentially because of fees," and that "Bruce [would] continue working on this issue," see, Meeting Minutes from April 16, 2003, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-18, Exhibit 47, at p. 4 of 59; JL 0075; handwritten notes of a meeting that appears to have taken place on or around December 22, 2004, which are not signed, and which relate that the "Enhanced Probation Fee" is an "idea that the Judges came up with," see, Handwritten Notes, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-18, Exhibit 48, at p. 6 of 59; JL 0089; and a draft of the Enhanced Probation Fee Program, which Michon drafted, and which apparently was never implemented. See, Program Draft, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-18, Exhibit 46, at p. 1-3 of 59 JL 71-73.
With respect to the claims under the ADA, and MHRA, Little argues that his letters of August 1, 2008, and August 13, 2008, were requests for Disability Leave, which ARC should [*31]  have granted under the Agreement, as such Leave is mandatory. In addition, Little contends that his requests for PersonalLleave, of up to one (1) year, were requests for an accommodation of his disability, and that ARC's failure to grant him the mandatory Disability Leave, or the Personal Leave accommodations, constituted a failure to provide reasonable accommodations under the ADA, and that ARC's failure to take action to meet with him in person, and to discuss his options, constituted a failure to engage in an interactive process, also in violation of the ADA.
Little argues that ARC was aware of his disability, and he avers that, on March 12, 2007, he filled out an employee questionnaire form, at ARC's request, and related in that form that he had "a mental disorder/disability," and that it was currently in remission. See, Little Aff., Docket No. 33, at p. 5 ¶22; Questionairre, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-17, Exhibit 29, at p. 8 of 104; ARC 0177. Little maintains that he met with Roy in February of 2006, when they discussed a charge of disability discrimination that Little had apparently filed, and that Little related his mental health problems to Roy during that meeting. Id. Roy sent [*32]  a letter to Little, on February 22, 2006, which related that Roy had received a letter, from the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, which reported that Little "claimed a disability of depression and anxiety disorder," and summarizes the meeting between Roy, Little, and Little's counsel, on February 17, 2006, and requests information from Little, related to his illness, in order to support his claim of disability. See, Roy Letter of February 22, 2006, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-17, Exhibit 40, at p. 36 of 104; JL 249. Roy also testified that he was aware that Little was receiving counseling, in 2008. See, Roy Depo., Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-4, at p. 42 of 75.
In addition, Little points to the FMLA Certification of Health Care Provider which, as we have noted, related that Little suffered from Bi-polar Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder, and that both illnesses were chronic and intermittent. Little also emphasizes that Hartlieb testified in her deposition, that ARC had suggested to Little that he apply for a Disability Leave, see, Hartlieb Depo, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-3, at p. 74 of 84, and that she was aware that Little had taken FMLA leave due to a mental illness. Id. at pp. 38-39 of 84.
Little contends [*33]  that the Record demonstrates that ARC had an animosity towards individuals with disabilities, as is assertedly shown in meeting minute notes, which relate Harris' presentation at a February 27, 2007 meeting, in which the notes state that "[t]he best defense in litigation is objective documentation stating that the employee did not do the job and listing the reasons why[,]" and that "[i]t is reasonable for a case to take a year or more to run its' [sic] course: documentation, discipline, discharge." See, Meeting Minutes of February 27, 2007, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-17, Exhibit 28, at p. 5 of 104; ARC 2935; but see, Hartlieb Depo., Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-3, at p. 19 of 84 (denying that there is a policy to discharge disabled employees). Little also underscores Roy's statement to the Board, in a meeting on July 18, 2008, that ARC had "followed [its] contract to the T," and that "all the circumstances that this individual might be dealing with on his end of the world are not * * * those issues aren't necessarily ours," see, Board Meeting Transcript from July 18, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-8, Exhibit 3, at p. 175 of 191, as well as Roy's statement, at an earlier Board meeting [*34]  on June 20, 2008, that ARC would "continue to recognize [Little's] medical condition, if it exists through doctor's documentation." See, Board Meeting Transcript of June 20, 2008, Docket No. 34-8, Exhibit 2, at pp. 81-82 of 191.
During the Board Meeting of July 18, 2008, Harris told the Board that Disability Leave was mandatory under the Agreement, but that the Agreement did not provide much guidance with respect to Disability Leave. See, Board Meeting Transcript from July 18, 2008, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-8, Exhibit 3, at pp. 173, 175-76 of 191. Harris also informed the Board that the most recent statement that ARC had from a physician, and that related to Little's medical condition, was more than ninety (90) days old, and did not contain an estimate of duration. Id. at p. 171 of 191. Brenner testified in his deposition that he did not recall seeking advice from an attorney in relation to other requests for leave. See, Deposition of Richard Brenner, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-2, at p. 38 of 45. With this factual backdrop, we proceed to the merits of ARC's Motion.12
III. Discussion
A. Standard of Review. Summary Judgment [*35]  is not an acceptable means of resolving triable issues, nor is it a disfavored procedural shortcut when there are no issues which require the unique proficiencies of a Jury in weighing the evidence, and in rendering credibility determinations. See, Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327 (1986); Midwest Oilseeds, Inc. v. Limagrain Genetics Corp., 387 F.3d 705, 711 (8th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 977 (2005). Summary Judgment is appropriate when we have viewed the facts, and the inferences drawn from those facts, in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and we have found no triable issue. See, Eide v. Grey Fox Technical Servs. Corp., 329 F.3d 600, 604 (8th Cir. 2003); Philip v. Ford Motor Co., 328 F.3d 1020, 1023 (8th Cir. 2003); United Fire & Casualty Co. v. Garvey, 328 F.3d 411, 413 (8th Cir. 2003).
For these purposes, a disputed fact is "material" if it must inevitably be resolved and the resolution will determine the outcome of the case, while a dispute is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable Jury could return a Verdict for the nonmoving party. See, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Planned Parenthood of Minnesota/ South Dakota v. Rounds, 372 F.3d 969, 972 (8th Cir. 2004); Fenney v. Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern R.R. Co., 327 F.3d 707, 711 (8th Cir. 2003).
As Rule 56(e)(2) makes clear, once the moving party files a properly supported Motion, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to demonstrate the existence of a genuine dispute. In sustaining that burden, "an opposing party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading; rather, its response must -- by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule -- set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial." Rule 56(e)(2), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; see also, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., supra at 256; Eddings v. City of Hot Springs, Ark., 323 F.3d 596, 602 (8th Cir. 2003).
Moreover, the movant [*36]  is entitled to Summary Judgment where the nonmoving party has failed "to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, supra at 322; see also, Forest Park II v. Hadley, 408 F.3d 1052, 1057 (8th Cir. 2005); Mercer v. City of Cedar Rapids, 308 F.3d 840, 843 (8th Cir. 2002); Hammond v. Northland Counseling Center, Inc., 218 F.3d 886, 891 (8th Cir. 2000). No genuine issue of fact exists in such a case because "a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, supra at 323; see also, Sallis v. University of Minnesota, 408 F.3d 470, 474 (8th Cir. 2005); Davis v. U.S. Bancorp, 383 F.3d 761, 768 (8th Cir. 2004); Bell Lumber and Pole Co. v. United States Fire Ins. Co., 60 F.3d 437, 441 (8th Cir. 1995).
B. Legal Analysis. Since they involve different considerations, we separately consider each of Little's causes of action.
1. The Whistleblower Act Claim. In his Amended Complaint, Little alleges that ARC violated his rights under the MWA, when it "wrongfully terminated [his] employment because he reported in good faith to ARC that he suspected ARC was violating Minnesota Statute §244.18 et seq. (local correctional fees and imposition on offenders)." Amended Complaint, Docket No. 1-5, at pp. 2 ¶5, and 6 ¶26.13 The MWA "prohibits retaliation against an employee who, 'in good faith, reports a violation or suspected violation of any federal or state law * * * to an employer or any governmental body or law enforcement official.'" Cokley v. City of Otsego, 623 N.W.2d 625, 630 (Minn.App. 2001), review denied (Minn., May 14, 2001), quoting Minnesota Statutes Section 181.932, Subdivision 1(a). Claims under the [*37]  Whistleblower Act follow the same burden-shifting analysis as set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), for claims of discrimination. See, Cokley v. City of Otsego, supra at 630; Hayes v. Dapper, 2008 WL 4301018 at *2 (Minn.App., September 23, 2008); Grundtner v. University of Minnesota, 730 N.W.2d 323, 329 (Minn.App. 2007).
Accordingly, "[f]irst, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliatory action;" "[t]hen the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its action;" and "[f]inally, the employee must demonstrate that the employer's articulated reason is a pretext for retaliation." Henry v. Indigenous People's Task Force, 2006 WL 3719658 at *2 (Minn.App., December 19, 2006), citing Cokley v. City of Otsego, supra at 630, citing, in turn, McDonnell Douglas Corp v. Green, supra at 802; see also, Boelter v. City of Coon Rapids, 67 F. Supp.2d 1040, 1049 (D. Minn. 1999); Buytendorp v. Extendicare Health Services, Inc., 498 F.3d 826, 834 (8th Cir. 2007). The ultimate burden of persuasion in demonstrating retaliation remains with the plaintiff. See, Rothmeier v. Investment Advisers, 556 N.W.2d 590, 593 (Minn.App. 1996); Grundtner v. University of Minnesota, supra at 329, citing Hubbard v. United Press Int'l, Inc., 330 N.W.2d 428, 445-46 (Minn. 1983).
In order to establish a prima facie case for a violation of the MWA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he engaged in statutorily-protected conduct, that he suffered an adverse employment action, and that there is a causal connection between the two. Id. at 592, quoting Hubbard v. United Press Int'l, Inc., supra at 444; Gee v. Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, 700 N.W.2d 548, 555 (Minn.App. 2005); Vollkommer v. Baldwin Township, 2010 WL 2362839 at *7 (Minn.App., June 15, 2010); Henry v. Indigenous People's Task Force, supra at *2; Borgersen v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., 729 N.W.2d 619, 624 (Minn.App. 2007).
In its Motion for Summary Judgment, ARC contends that Little has failed to establish a prima facie case for a violation of the MWA, and that, as a result, his MWA claim must fail. We agree, as the Record demonstrates that the conduct, which Little reported to his superiors, and alleges to be illegal [*38]  under Section 244.18, did not constitute a violation of that Statute.
"To state a claim under the whistleblower statute, the employee does not need to identify in the report the exact law that is violated, but the conduct reported must at least implicate a federal or state law." Kratzer v. Welsh Companies, LLC, 771 N.W.2d 14, 19 (Minn. 2009), citing Abraham v. County of Hennepin, 639 N.W.2d 342, 354-55 (Minn. 2002); Borgersen v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., supra at 624. Accordingly, "[t]he proper standard to apply when assessing the legal sufficiency of a claim under the whistleblower statute is to assume that the facts have occurred as reported and then determine * * * whether those facts 'constitute a violation of law or rule adopted pursuant to law.'" Id., at 22, quoting Abraham v. County of Hennepin, supra at 355, citing, in turn, Obst v. Microtron, Inc., 614 N.W.2d 196, 204 (Minn. 2000).
"In other words, to find protected conduct, there need not be an actual violation of the law * * * because the facts may not be as the employee reported them to be, * * * [but] the law alleged to have been violated must exist," and "[i]f it later turns out that the facts are not as the employee reported them in good faith to be, the conduct is protected so long as the facts, if they had been true, would be a violation of the law." Id. at 22-23 [emphasis in original]. However, the Minnesota Supreme Court has explicitly rejected the notion that a claim, under the Whistleblower Act, can be predicated upon a report [*39]  of conduct that the plaintiff suspected, in good faith, to be a violation of the statute, even if conduct was not violative of that statute. Id. at 21-22 ("[The plaintiff] contended at oral argument that an actual violation of the rule is not necessary as long as he suspected in good faith that the conduct was a violation of the rule, and that because he did suspect the law was violated, he engaged in protected conduct," but "[w]e have rejected this argument on at least three occasions and we do so again in this case.").
The conduct that Little alleges to have violated Minnesota Statutes Section 244.18 is three-fold: 1) that ARC allegedly failed to make its fees "reasonably related to [probationers'] abilities to pay," by failing to assess the probationers' individualized financial situations; 2) that, with respect to the "enhanced probation" program, and other programs, ARC allegedly failed to make its fees "reasonably related to * * * the actual cost of correctional services," by charging for services that were not provided; and 3) that ARC had a policy of denying requests for indigency waivers of the fees.14 See, Little's Memo., Docket No. 31, at pp. 18-19 of 45.
Both parties rely upon the plain language of the Statute to support [*40]  their respective positions. In relevant part, Section 244.18, Subdivision 2, provides as follows:
A local correctional agency may establish a schedule of local correctional fees to charge persons under the supervision and control of the local correctional agency to defray costs associated with correctional services. The local correctional fees on the schedule must be reasonably related to defendants' abilities to pay and the actual cost of correctional services.15
In addition, Section 244.18, Subdivision 4, provides as follows:
The chief executive officer of the local correctional agency may waive payment of the [local correctional] fee if the officer determines that the offender does not have the ability to pay the fee, the prospects for payment are poor, or there are extenuating circumstances justifying waiver of the fee. Instead of waiving the fee, the local correctional agency may require the offender to perform community work service as a means of paying the fee.
There is no significant legislative history that is related to Section 244.18, that the parties have drawn to our attention, and our independent research has disclosed none. Nor have the parties identified any duly promulgated Regulations that might apply, and there is no case law on the subject. [*41] 16
Minnesota Statutes Section 241.272, which applies to the Minnesota Department of Corrections, employs the same language as the final sentence of Section 244.18, Subdivision 2, but that Statute is also not addressed by any case law, and therefore, we find ourselves in uncharted territory, and must resort to the plain language of Section 244.18 itself, in order to resolve this issue of first impression. See, ILHC of Eagan, LLC v. County of Dakota, 693 N.W.2d 412, 419 (Minn. 2005)("The touch-stone for statutory interpretation is the plain meaning of a statute's language."); City of Cohasset v. Minnesota Power, 776 N.W.2d 776, 780 (Minn.App. 2010)("[W]e turn first to the plain language of the statute," in order to "ascertain and effectuate the legislature's intent.").
Here, Little has pointed to no ambiguity in Section 244.18, and we find none, and so, we "apply the statute's plain meaning." American Tower, L.P. v. City of Grant, 636 N.W.2d 309, 312 (Minn. 2001)("When interpreting a statute, a court must first determine whether the statute's language, on its face, is ambiguous," and where it is unambiguous, the Court applies the plain meaning of that language); Carlson v. Allstate Ins. Co., 734 N.W.2d 695, 700-01 (Minn. App. 2007), aff'd, 749 N.W.2d 41 (Minn. 2008)("If the statute is not ambiguous, we must apply the plain meaning of the statute.")[emphasis added], citing In re Welfare of E.S.C., 731 N.W.2d 149, 152 (Minn.App. 2007). Further, as the Minnesota Supreme Court recently cautioned, "[w]e will not disregard 'the letter of the law * * * under the pretext of pursuing the spirit.'" Krueger v. Zeman Construction Co., 781 N.W.2d 858, 861 (Minn. 2010), quoting Minnesota Statutes Section 645.16.
Little's argument [*42]  is not supported by the plain language of Section 244.18, as the most natural and ordinary reading of that language reflects that the Section simply sets an outer boundary upon the discretion of local correctional agencies to assess fees -- or, put differently, Section 244.18 permits local correctional agencies to assess fees,17 but mandates that they create a fee schedule, for probationers as a group, that is not arbitrary. While Little argues that the final sentence of Subdivision 2 is intended to apply to probationers individually, the language itself relates the fee schedule to probationers as a collective group, and not as individuals. See, Minnesota Statutes Section 244.18, Subdivision 2 ("The local correctional fees on the schedule must be reasonably related to defendants' abilities to pay and the actual cost of correctional services.")[emphasis added].
Further, Subdivision 4, which provides that a local correctional agency may waive fees for probationers, where the agency determines it is warranted, see, Minnesota Statutes Section 244.18, Subdivision 4, would be superfluous if the fees were already required to be tailored to an individual probationer's ability to pay. See, In re Administrative Order Issued to Wright County, 784 N.W.2d 398, 403 (Minn. App. 2010)("A statute should be interpreted, whenever possible, to give effect to all of its provisions; no word, phrase, or sentence should [*43]  be deemed superfluous, void, or insignificant."). Accordingly, Little's reading of the statute, that ARC is required to make an individualized assessment of each probationer, before assessing the fees for that probationer, cannot be supported by the language, and the reported violations, with respect to individual assessments, were not as to illegal conduct.18
Little also contends that the extra fees, which ARC charged for the "enhanced probation" program, violated Section 244.18, since, assertedly, ARC provided no extra services for probationers on that program. As a consequence, Little argues that the "enhanced probation" fees were not "reasonably related" to "the actual cost of correctional services," and that he reported that violation, and was terminated as a consequence, in violation of the MWA. However, we find no merit to the argument, since, for the same reasons as we have already addressed, based upon the plain language of the statute, we find that Section 244.18, Subdivision 2, does not require local correctional facilities to assess fees on an itemized basis, but rather, requires that the global fee schedule be implemented in reasonable proportion to the overall costs of providing services to [*44]  probationers.
Our conclusion is further supported by the additional language in Subdivision 2, that "[a] local correctional agency may establish a schedule of local correctional fees to charge persons under the supervision and control of the local correctional agency to defray costs associated with correctional services." Minnesota Statutes Section 244.18, Subdivision 2. The most natural reading of that clause is that the Legislature intended that local correctional agencies would be able to recoup some of the costs of providing services, on an organizational level, by collecting fees from probationers, and not that the agencies would be required to charge probationers for their services à la carte. Accordingly, the reported conduct, in failing to develop a per service system of fees, was not illegal.
As the final piece of his Whistleblower claim, Little asserts that he reported that ARC had an illegal policy of denying waivers of probation fees to indigent probationers. In support of that contention, Little cites to his Affidavit, in which he attests that McCarthy told him that waiver requests were always denied, see, Little Aff., Docket No. 33, at p. 5 ¶20; the meeting minutes from July 17, 2007, which relate that "[w]e are no longer [*45]  forgiving fees," and that, "[i]f they appeal, the answer will always be 'NO'," and that "[a]ll unpaid fees will be sent to Revenue Recapture," Meeting Minutes of July 17, 2007, Lelii Aff., Docket No. 34-19, Exhibit 66, at p. 31 of 66, ARC 1358; and the Affidavit of George Langhorst, who is a former ARC Probation Officer, who attests that ARC had a waiver policy that made it "near impossible" for probationer's to obtain waivers. See, Affidavit of George Langhorst, Lelli Aff., Docket No. 34-10, Exhibit 22, at p. 41 of 41. As we have noted, ARC has submitted Roy's averment that, at all relevant times, Probation Officers could request waivers of fees for indigent probationers.
We find that any factual dispute, which relates to the policy concerning fee waivers, is immaterial, as Section 244.18, Subdivision 4, plainly provides that "[t]he chief executive officer of the local correctional agency may waive payment of the fee if the officer determines that the offender does not have the ability to pay the fee, the prospects for payment are poor, or there are extenuating circumstances justifying waiver of the fee," and that, "[i]nstead of waiving the fee, the local correctional agency may require the offender to perform [*46]  community work service as a means of paying the fee." [Emphasis added]. Accordingly, the plain language of Subdivision 4 does not require local correctional facilities to waive fees, and leaves such waivers to the discretion of the agencies. See, Semler v. Klang, 743 N.W.2d 273, 279 (Minn. App. 2007)("In construing statutes, 'may' is permissive and 'shall' is mandatory."), citing Minnesota Statutes Section 645.44, Subdivisions 15 and 16; In re Estate of Palmer, 647 N.W.2d 13, 15 (Minn.App. 2002), aff'd, 658 N.W.2d 197 (Minn. 2003) ("may" cannot be construed as "must"); Coalition of Greater Minnesota Cities v. Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, 765 N.W.2d 159, 166-67 (Minn.App. 2009) ("may" is "permissive," and indicates reasonable discretion); see, e.g., Wales v. Trung, 2009 WL 4906502 at *12-13 (D. Minn., December 16, 2009)(where Federal Statutes provide that the Bureau of Prisons "may" place a prisoner in home confinement, rather than prison, the decision is left to the agency's discretion, and the Statute does not "entitle a prisoner to placement in home confinement for any period of time."). While refusing to ever waive fees would be harsh, we do not find that it would be a violation of the Statute and, frankly, if the circumstances were as draconian as Little appears to allege, then we seriously doubt that the issues, that we now confront as ones of first impression, would not have been previously litigated, or the statutory language altered.
As a consequence, Little has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact, and the Record demonstrates [*47]  that he did not engage in protected conduct. As a consequence, he has failed to establish a prima facie case, that he was terminated from his employment at ARC in violation of the Whistleblower Act. ARC is entitled to Summary Judgment in its favor on Little's MWA claim on that basis, and we do not address the parties other arguments with respect to the MWA.19 See, Borgersen v. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., supra at 624-25 (District Court did not err in granting Summary Judgment, based upon its conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to show that he had made a report of illegal conduct); Sledge v. Minneapolis Public Housing Authority, 2006 WL 463542 at *6 (Minn.App., February 28, 2006)(where "report" did not describe any illegal conduct, Summary Judgment on MWA claim was proper); Obst v. Microtrong, Inc., supra at 204 (overturning a Jury Verdict, in favor of an MWA plaintiff, where he had "fail[ed] to establish that his reports to [the defendant] implicated a violation or suspected violation of an actual law," rather than a contract provision).
2. The Disability Claims.20 Little contends that ARC violated his rights under the ADA, and MHRA, by ignoring his requests for disability leave, as a part of ARC's purported policy to "document, discipline, [and] discharge," employees with disabilities. Specifically, Little raises three (3) arguments with respect to the ADA: 1) that ARC [*48]  failed to engage in the interactive process, see, Amended Complaint, Docket No. 1-5, at p. 7 ¶¶29 and 32; 2) that ARC failed to grant Little a reasonable accommodation, id. at p. 7 ¶32; and 3) that ARC wrongfully discharged Little, in retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation, id. at p. 7 ¶¶29 and 34; see also, Little's Memo, Docket No. 31, at p. 39 of 45, and he also raises one (1) claim under the MHRA, that ARC terminated his employment because of his disability.21 See, Little's Memo, Docket No. 31, at pp. 43-44 of 45. Since the claims related to reasonable accommodations, retaliatory discharge, and discriminatory discharge, involve different analyses, we also address them separately.
a. The Reasonable Accommodation Claims. Little argues that ARC failed to engage in the interactive process in good faith, and failed to provide him with reasonable accommodations for his disability. In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, ARC contends that Little never requested a "reasonable accommodation," in order to trigger the "interactive process" requirements of the ADA, because he requested Personal Leaves, instead of a Disability Leave, and [*49]  that ARC acted in good faith, but Little did not. See, ARC's Reply Memorandum, at pp. 6-7 of 13.
1. Standard of Review. An employee may assert a claim for discrimination against an employer, for "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, * * * unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of [the employer]." Heaser v. The Toro Co., 247 F.3d 826, 830 (8th Cir. 2001), quoting Title 42 U.S.C. §12112(b)(5)(A)[alterations in original]. "Where the employee requests accommo-dation, the employer must engage in an 'informal, interactive process' with the employee to identify the limitations caused by the disability and the potential reasonable accommodations to overcome those limitations." Battle v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 438 F.3d 856, 862 (8th Cir. 2006).
The general rule is that "it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed." Mole v. Buckhorn Rubber Products, Inc., 165 F.3d 1212, 1217 (8th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 821 (1999); Wallin v. Minnesota Dep't of Corr., 153 F.3d 681, 689 (8th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1004 (1999); Kobus v. College of St. Scholastica, Inc., 608 F.3d 1034, 1038 (8th Cir. 2010); see also, Taylor v. Principal Financial Group, Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1029 (1996)("Where the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer, as is often the case when mental disabilities are involved, the initial [*50]  burden rests primarily with the employee * * * to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations."); Rask v. Fresenius Medical Care North America, 509 F.3d 466, 470 (8th Cir. 2007)(same), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct. 2965 (2008); Ballard v. Rubin, 284 F.3d 957, 960 (8th Cir. 2002).
Such a rule exists because an employee "cannot 'expect the employer to read [his or her] mind and know [he or she] secretly wanted a particular accommodation and [then] sue the employer for not providing it," Mole v. Buckhorn Rubber Products, Inc., supra at 1218, citing Ferry v. Roosevelt Bank, 883 F. Supp. 435, 441 (E.D. Mo. 1995), and it is only "when the disabled individual requests accommodation, [that] it becomes necessary to initiate the interactive process," in order to determine what accommodations can reasonably be implemented. Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of America, Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 952 (8th Cir. 1999); see also, Title 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(o)(3).
As a result, in order to show that an employer has failed to participate in the interactive process, the employee must demonstrate that "'1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith.'" Ballard v. Rubin, supra at 960, quoting Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of America, Inc., supra at 952, quoting, in turn, Taylor v. Phoenixville School District, 174 F.3d 142, 165 (3rd Cir. 1999);22 Canny v. Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up Bottling Group, Inc., 439 F.3d 894, 902 (8th Cir. 2006); Knutson v. Medtronic, Inc., 2006 WL 1851142 at *9 (D. Minn., July 3, 2006). Further, "[t]he mere failure of an employer [*51]  to engage in the interactive process does not give rise to per se liability, although for summary judgment purposes such failure is considered prima facie evidence that the employer may be acting in bad faith." Id.
2. Legal Analysis. ARC argues that, as a matter of law, Little's communications to ARC did not contain a reasonably specific request, in order to trigger the interactive process, but we cannot agree.
On his FMLA Certification of Health Care Provider, which was completed on April 8, 2008, Little disclosed his long-standing diagnoses of Bipolar Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, which, at that time, left him unable to work, and he also disclosed that he suffered from a mental illness on his 2007 Questionnaire, although it was in remission. As a consequence, ARC "knew about" Little's disability, in order to satisfy the first prong of the interactive process test. The Record also demonstrates that, at the end of his FMLA leave, Little failed to return to work, began a series of requests for significant additional time off, made vague assertions that his request for leave was related to his "health," at least to some degree, and also submitted a note from his physician, on July 2, [*52]  2008, as well as another note approximately one (1) month later, which indicated that he was unable to work at that time, presumably for unspecified medical reasons.
Taking all inferences in favor of Little, who is the non-moving party, we find that those facts -- at least marginally -- cross the threshold, and could permit a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that Little sufficiently informed ARC that he might have a disability, for which he might have needed accommodations, in order to satisfy the second prong, and trigger the interactive process, notwithstanding Little's failure to specifically invoke the "Disability Leave" clause of the Agreement. See, Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 313 (3rd Cir. 1999)(no "magic words" are required to make a request, and "[i]f there was any further information that the school district felt it needed to justify an accommodation, it was incumbent on the school district to ask for it."); Colwell v. Rite Aid Corp., 602 F.3d 495, 506 (3rd Cir. 2010)(where circumstances are sufficient to alert an employer of the possibility that an employee requires accommodations for his or her disability, the employer must "make appropriate inquiries about the possible need for an accommodation."); Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of America, Inc., supra at 952 n. 5; Ballard v. Rubin, supra at 962 (an ambiguous and contradictory letter "could be viewed" as raising a triable [*53]  issue as to whether the request was reasonably specific, but dismissing claim on other grounds).
Accordingly, we find that ARC's obligation to engage in the interactive process, in order to determine if Little required reasonable accommodations for his disability, was triggered. Nonetheless, we find that Little has failed on the third prong for, although ARC was put on notice of the potential need to accommodate a disability of Little's, no reasonable fact-finder could conclude that ARC failed to engage in the interactive process in good faith, since the evidence of Record all points in one direction -- that Little, himself, caused the breakdown of the interactive process, and prevented ARC from suggesting, or implementing, appropriate accommodations.
Little contends that ARC failed to engage in good faith, because ARC insisted that Little provide information about "the duration of Jay Little's medical condition" when, as Little argues, ARC had all the information necessary, from the FMLA forms, which were completed in April of 2008, and the purported "fact" that Little "never returned to work from the FMLA leave because he [sic] mental condition never stabilized." See, Little's Memo., [*54]  Docket No. 31, at p. 42 of 45 [emphasis in original]. We find the argument to be without merit, as it is undisputed that Little failed to even clarify that he sought leave on the basis of his disability, and further failed to provide ARC with medical information that would have informed ARC of his mental health status after his FMLA leave expired, in order to support his requests for a year-long leave of absence.
Little does not contradict the contents of the letters contained within the Record, and there is no dispute that nearly all of the communications between himself, and ARC, are contained within those letters, see, Little Depo., Second Bjorklund Aff., Docket No. 43-1, nor does Little contend that he submitted other documents to ARC, which are not contained within the Record before us.
In the FMLA Certification of Health Care Provider, which was completed in April of 2008, Little's psychiatrist related that he was unable to opine as to the duration of Little's illness, and also reported that Little had suffered for "decades" from his diagnosed illness -- during which time he had worked full time for ARC --and that his symptoms were "intermittent," and "fluctuating," but provided [*55]  no more information as to the extent, nature, or duration, of Little's illness. When Little's FMLA leave was set to expire, he requested a "Personal Leave," and not a Disability Leave under the Agreement, and specifically based his leave request upon concerns that were only related to employment issues that he had with ARC, and not upon his mental illness. Further, the FMLA certification was two (2) months old on June 10, 2008, when Little first alerted Fawcett that his request for a Personal Leave was at least partially based on his "health" -- again, without any specific mention of any mental disability -- and Fawcett reasonably requested documentation of any medical problems for which Little might need an extended leave.
All told, the Record demonstrates that ARC requested medical documentation from Little no fewer than five (5) times, and ARC did everything within its power to assist Little in requesting accommodations for a disability -- if that was what he truly was seeking -- including the extension of his vacation and sick time, making the suggestion that he apply for a Disability Leave if he felt he qualified, explaining to him the information that was necessary to support [*56]  such an application, and supplying him with two (2) simple forms to request such a leave -- including an FMLA Certification form with which he was already familiar.23 See, Bultemeyer v. Fort Wayne Community Schools., 100 F.3d 1281, 1285-86 (7th Cir. 1996)(when it appears that an employee might need an accommodation, but does not know how to ask for it, the employer should do what it can to help); Cannice v. Norwest Bank N.A., 189 F.3d 723, 727 (8th Cir. 1999)(when an employee suffers a mental disability, an employer must "meet him halfway"), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1019 (2000).
Despite ARC's efforts, and despite the Agreement's provision, in its introductory paragraph to the Leave of Absence section, that an employee seeking a leave of absence must "state the reason for and the anticipated duration of the leave of absence," Little refused to submit any detailed or explanatory information, and the short forms from his physician, that Little submitted to ARC, and that related no more than that he was "unable to work at this time" -- even assuming that ARC received the second of those forms before making its decision to terminate Little's employment -- provided ARC with no information as to the nature of Little's illness, nor how long ARC could expect him to be unable to work, [*57]  and so, they provided no information on the limitations caused by his illness, in order for ARC to assess whether a year-long leave was justified, coming after twelve (12) weeks of leave that had already been allowed, or whether an alternative could be implemented. See, Mullen v. Harvey, 2010 WL 454489 at *7 (S.D.W.Va., February 2, 2010)("A party that fails to communicate is not acting in good faith to engage in this process and to find a solution."); Robinson v. American International Group, Inc., 2009 WL 3154312 at *7 (S.D.N.Y., September 30, 2009)(the employee, who had refused to provide more than cursory medical information, upon the reasonable request of the employer, caused the breakdown in the interactive process); Allen v. Pacific Bell, 348 F.3d 1113, 1115 (9th Cir. 2003)(if an employee fails to supply reasonably requested medical evidence, the employer is under no obligation to further engage in the interactive process); see also, Kratzer v. Rockwell Collins, Inc., 398 F.3d 1040, 1045 (8th Cir. 2005)(the plaintiff's claim of a failure to reasonably accommodate failed, because she had failed to inform the employer of the necessary accommodation, when she failed to obtain an updated physical evaluation, after she indicated that she might have had further limitations).
Moreover, Little further muddied the waters when, even after ARC had suggested that Little apply for a Disability Leave if he qualified, he persistently informed ARC that he sought a "Personal Leave," [*58]  which is governed by its own section of the Agreement, and which Little specifically cited in his letter of July 17, 2008.24 His insistence, that he did not want Disability Leave, reasonably reflected to ARC that his request for leave was not based upon an extended illness and, when presented with his requests for a Personal Leave, partly because of his "health," ARC reasonably sought medical information from Little, and a concrete statement of the basis for his leave requests, as ARC had determined that an extended leave of absence could not be granted in the absence of a sufficiently documented medical reason. Contrary to what Little implicitly argues here, ARC was not required to simply accept his assertion that, for unspecified health reasons, and for other reasons, he needed a year-long leave of absence, based upon cursory, check-box notes from his physician, and we find that ARC's conduct, in seeking supporting documentation, was objectively reasonable.25 See, Buboltz v. Residential Advantages, Inc., 523 F.3d 864, 870 (8th Cir. 2008)(an employer need not provide exact accommodation requested); Kennedy v. Superior Printing Co., 215 F.3d 650, 656 (6th Cir. 2000)(an employer is not required to simply take an employee's word that he has an illness that requires accommodation); Economou v. Caldera, 2000 WL 1844773 at *24 (S.D.N.Y., December 18, 2000)("When [the plaintiff] subsequently submitted [*59]  a doctor's note stating that [the plaintiff] was 'totally incapacitated' and could not work at all due to medication * * *, it was reasonable for [the employer] to request further documentation to determine whether [the plaintiff's] absence from work would be justified," under the Rehabilitation Act).26
While there is also no dispute that Little met with Fawcett on July 2, 2008, and that Fawcett ended the conversation because he felt that the situation was "adversarial," Little does not contradict Fawcett's testimony that, during that meeting, he explained that ARC required medical information from Little -- indeed, Little's Affidavit confirms that fact. Further, the Record demonstrates that Little and ARC employees, including Fawcett, continued to communicate through letters after the meeting of July 2, 2008, such that the obviously awkward meeting did not cause a breakdown in the process, and the Record demonstrates that ARC considered Little's requests to be for Personal Leave, which were not substantiated by anything more than cursory medical information, and were primarily based upon employment disputes, and placed those requests before the Board for consideration, which denied them [*60]  due to staffing concerns.
While Little argues that he consistently refused the label of "Disability Leave," because he was embarrassed to admit he was suffering from a disability, and while we are not without sympathy for Little's struggles with his mental health, he cannot place blame upon ARC for his unwillingness to explain the amorphous bases for his leave requests, or his refusal to provide supporting medical documentation. As a consequence, on the Record presented, and taking all inferences in Little's favor, we find that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude that ARC failed to engage in the interactive process in good faith. See, Fjellstad v. Pizza Hut of America, Inc., supra at 953 n. 7 (noting that "employers can show their good faith attempt to find a reasonable accommodation in many ways, such as meeting with the employee who requests accommodation, requesting information about the condition and what limitations the employee has, asking the employee what he or she specifically wants, showing some sign of having considered the employee's request, and offering and discussing available alternatives when the employee's request is too burdensome.").
To the contrary, the Record demonstrates that Little's failure to provide reasonably [*61]  requested medical information, in support of his requests for extended leave, prevented ARC from investigating the reasonableness of his leave requests --and, indeed, significantly confused the basis of those leave requests -- and substantially hindered the interactive process, which resulted in its breakdown. See, Russell v. TG Missouri Corp., 340 F.3d 735, 742 (8th Cir. 2003)(where the employee had "stalled" the interactive process, there was no inference of bad faith on the part of the employer, and no genuine issue as to whether the employer had failed to reasonably accommodate her disabilities).
Accordingly, we find that Little has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact, and ARC is entitled to Summary Judgment on his claim, that is based upon the interactive process. See, Jackson v. City of Chicago, 414 F.3d 806, 814 (7th Cir. 2005)(employee's failure to cooperate in the interactive process meant that "she could not claim that the [employer] failed to accommodate her."); Templeton v. Neodata Services, Inc., 162 F.3d 617, 619 (10th Cir. 1998)(employee who had refused to update her medical status, in order to clarify whether and when she could return, could not claim a failure to accommodate); Corujo-Marti v. Triple-S, Inc., 519 F.Supp.2d 201, 217 (D.P.R. 2007)("Failing to cooperate in the interactive process is fatal to an individual's ADA claim for reasonable accommodation.")[collecting cases]; Martinez v. Cole Sewell Corp., 233 F. Supp.2d 1097, 1135 (N.D. Iowa 2002) (the employee's failure to cooperate [*62]  with employer caused the breakdown of the interactive process and precluded her claim of failure to reasonably accommodate).
Moreover, we find that Little has failed to raise a genuine issue with respect to the fourth prong -- namely, whether he could have been reasonably accommodated, and therefore, was a "qualified individual" -- that is, that he could have performed the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodations. See, Fenney v. Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern R.R. Co., supra at 712 and 718 (to establish a prima facie claim of failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he is a "qualified individual," which requires an analysis of the reasonableness of the accommodation); McClean v. Case Corp., Inc., supra at 918 (an employee can be a qualified individual, if he can perform the job with a reasonable accommodation); Windsor v. Parkway School District, supra at *9.
Here, ARC's policy on unexcused absences demonstrates that regular and reliable attendance is essential to the job, and further, "'[a]n employee who is unable to come to work on a regular basis [is] unable to satisfy any of the functions of the job in question, much less the essential ones.'" Pickens v. Soo Line Railroad Co., 264 F.3d 773, 778 (8th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1057 (8th Cir. 2001), quoting Moore v. Payless Shoe Source, Inc., 187 F.3d 845, 848 (8th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1050 (1999). There does not appear to be any dispute that Little was unable to attend work, without accommodations.27
While [*63]  a leave of absence for medical reasons can, in some circumstances, be a reasonable accommodation, Little failed to provide ARC with sufficient documentation, in order to support the year-long leave that he sought. See, Windsor v. Parkway Sch. Dist., 2008 WL 161849 at *6 (E.D. Mo., January 15, 2008)(A leave of absence of definite duration can be a reasonable accommodation, but "to be reasonable, the plaintiff must present evidence of the expected duration of the impairment -- and not the duration of the leave request."), quoting Hudson v. MCI Telecomms. Corp., 87 F.3d 1167, 1169 (10th Cir. 1996); McNamara v. Tourneau, Inc., 496 F.Supp.2d 366, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)("[E]ven assuming an extended or indefinite leave of absence could be considered a reasonable accommodation, [the employee] did not provide [the employer] with adequate medical documentation to show that such a leave was warranted," which was fatal to the employee's failure to accommodate claim). In addition, "when an employer has already provided a substantial leave of absence, any additional leave period of a significant duration, with no clear prospects for recovery, is an objectively unreasonable accommodation." Id. at *7, citing Walsh v. United Parcel Service, 201 F.3d 718, 727 (6th Cir. 2000) [collecting cases]; see also, Brannon v. Luco Mop Co., 521 F.3d 843, 849 (8th Cir. 2008)(an employer is not required to permit unlimited absenteeism), cert. denied, --- U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 725 (2008).
Little argues that ARC should have granted a Disability Leave, or his Personal Leave, and [*64]  that the accommodation would have been reasonable, because the Agreement mandates up to a year of leave, for Disability.28 See, Little's Memo., Docket No. 31, at p. 43 of 45 ("The accomadation [sic] requested, a disability leave pursuant to the union contract could have been easily granted, especially considering the disability leave is not discretionary."). However, Little expressly refused to apply for a Disability Leave under the Agreement, and failed to provide the documentation for an "extended illness" that was required for a Disability Leave, or which would have substantiated his vague and contradictory requests for an extended leave of absence, and the Record would not permit a reasonable fact-finder to conclude otherwise. See, Husinga v. Federal-Mogul Ignition Co., 519 F. Supp.2d 929, 961 n. 31 (S.D. Iowa 2007)("As a matter of law, requiring an employer to contravene a collective bargaining agreement is not reasonable * * *."); Windsor v. Parkway Sch. Dist., supra at *6 (to be reasonable, a leave request must include some information with respect to the expected duration of the disability).
Accordingly, ARC is entitled to Summary Judgment as to the claim with respect to the interactive process, because Little has failed to demonstrate that he could have been reasonably accommodated. See, Fjellstad v. Pizza Hut of America, Inc., supra at 954 ("The employee [*65]  still carries the burden of showing that a particular accommodation would have made the employee qualified to perform the essential functions of the job."); Cannice v. Norwest Bank Iowa N.A., supra at 727.
Further, to the extent that Little asserts a separate "failure to accommodate" claim, which is not based upon the interactive process, see, Tobin v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 433 F.3d 100, 108 n. 7 (1st Cir. 2005)(noting that a "failure to accommodate" claim can be based on a failure to interact in good faith, or on a bare failure to accommodate), that claim must fail, for the same reason. See, Brannon v. Luco Mop Co., supra at 849 (where plaintiff had failed to establish that her successive requests for leave were reasonable accommodations that would allow her to return to work, she had failed to demonstrate that she was a "qualified individual" under the ADA, in order to raise a prima facie claim of discrimination);see also, Scheer v. City of Cedar Rapids, 956 F. Supp. 1496, 1501-02 (N.D. Iowa 1997)(employee's request for at least a six-month leave of absence, with a speculative return date, was essentially a request for an indefinite leave of absence, and was objectively unreasonable).
b. The Retaliatory Discharge Claim. Title 42 U.S.C. §12203 (a) prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee, for engaging in conduct that is protected by the ADA, and analysis of that type of claim follows the familiar McDonnell Douglas [*66]  burden-shifting framework. See, Jenkins v. Cleco Power, LLC, 487 F.3d 309, 316-17 (5th Cir. 2007). In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, Little must "show that he engaged in protected activity, that adverse action was taken against him by [ARC], and a causal connection between the two occurrences." Ristrom v. Asbestos Workers Local 34 Joint Apprenticeship Committee, 370 F.3d 763 (8th Cir. 2004), citing Cossette v. Minnesota Power & Light, 188 F.3d 964, 972 (8th Cir. 1999). On the Record presented, we find that, as a matter of law, Little has failed to establish that prima facie showing, because he has failed to raise any genuine issue as to the basis for his termination of employment.
ARC has provided evidence, in the form of the Termination Letter of August 13, 2008, which demonstrates that it terminated Little's employment, because he had accumulated three (3) consecutive unexcused absences. To counter that evidence, Little has made only a bare, conclusory assertion, that he "requested a [sic] accomodation [sic] and instead of granting Plaintiff a disability leave, Defendant ARC fired him in accordance with its policy of documenting, disciplining, and discharging ARC employees with mental disabilities." Little's Memo, Docket No. 31, at p. 43 of 45. Little's opposition to the Summary Judgment Motion cannot rest upon bare conclusions and allegations, and his argument fails to direct [*67]  our attention to anything in the nature of evidence that supports his contention, that ARC terminated his employment in retaliation for his request for reasonable accommodations because, assertedly, ARC had a policy of "documenting, disciplining, [and] discharging" disabled employees.29 See, Lowery v. Hazelwood School Dist., 244 F.3d 654, 659 (8th Cir. 2001)("the sort of 'scintilla' of evidence that can do no more than raise some 'metaphysical doubt'" as to the motivations of the decision-makers is insufficient to survive Summary Judgment); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., supra at 252 (the "mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" is insufficient to defeat Summary Judgment); see also, Stewart v. Ind. Sch. Dist. No. 196, 481 F.3d 1034, 1045-46 (8th Cir. 2007)(a voicemail that, at most, appeared "suspicious," was a "mere scintilla," and was insufficient to show a causal relationship between adverse employment action and protected conduct."). Accordingly, we find that ARC is entitled to Summary Judgment in its favor, on Little's ADA retaliation claim.
c. The Discriminatory Discharge Claim.30 Like the ADA, the MHRA "prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual with a disability." Mallon v. United States Physical Therapy, Ltd., 395 F. Supp.2d 810, 816 (D. Minn. 2005), citing Minnesota Statutes Section 363A.08, Subdivision 2(1)(2). Under the MHRA, Courts employ the familiar McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Id., [*68]  citing Snow v. Ridgeview Med. Ctr, 128 F.3d 1201, 1205 (8th Cir. 1997); see also, Sigurdson v. Carl Bolander & Sons Co., 532 N.W.2d 225, 227 (Minn. 1995)(noting that Minnesota Courts had adopted the McDonnell Douglas framework for disability discrimination claims).
Accordingly, under the MHRA, in order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must show: (1) that he was disabled, (2) that he was qualified to do the essential job functions with or without a reasonable accommodation, and (3) that he suffered an adverse employment action "'under circumstances that raise an inference of unlawful disability discrimination.'" Tori v. University of Minnesota, 2006 WL 3772316 at *6 (Minn.App., December 26, 2006), quoting Mole v. Buckhorn Rubber Prods., Inc., supra at 1216; Burchett v. Target Corp., 340 F.3d 510, 516 (8th Cir. 2003); Snow v. Ridgeview Medical Center, supra at 1206. Once a prima facie showing has been made, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, see, Mallon v. United States Physical Therapy, supra at 816, and where the employer satisfies that step, the burden of production then shifts back to the employee, to demonstrate that the asserted reason is a pretext for discrimination. See, Hoover v. Norwest Private Mortgage Banking, 632 N.W.2d 534, 545 (Minn. 2001).
Here, ARC contends that Little has failed to establish a prima facie showing of discriminatory discharge, because he has failed to put forth evidence that could raise an inference of discriminatory motive for his termination. In his Opposition to the Motion, Little relies [*69]  upon the temporal relationship between his requests for leave, and his termination, and he appears to analogize to cases of retaliatory discharge, in order to argue that the timing raises a reasonable inference that ARC terminated his employment because of his disability. See, Little's Memo., Docket No. 31, at p. 44 of 45, citing Tretter v. Liquipak International, Inc., 356 N.W.2d 713, 715 (Minn. App. 1984)("To establish a prima facie case of retaliation an employee must establish: (1) statutorily-protected conduct by the employee; (2) adverse employment action by the employer; and (3) a causal connection between the two."), and Hubbard v. United Press International, Inc., supra at 445("[A] prima facie case of retaliatory discharge concerns the degree to which the record shows a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action," and "the inference arising from UPI's discharge of Hubbard only 2 days after service of the complaint * * * is sufficient to show retaliatory motive * * *.").
However, in his reliance upon temporal proximity, Little has failed to address the intervening circumstances that are glaringly present in this case, and which interrupt whatever inferential nexus that could be made by the timing of his requests for a leave of absence, and his termination -- namely, his [*70]  unexcused absences, after his FMLA leave had expired, his two (2) requests for Personal Leave had been denied, his vacation and sick time could not be further extended, and his receipt of a number of letters informing him of those facts, and warning him that failing to return to work, or cooperate with ARC so to determine whether a Disability Leave was warranted, would result in unexcused absences. See, Kiel v. Select Artificials, Inc., 169 F.3d 1131, 1136 (8th Cir. 1999)(in an ADA retaliation claim, an employee's intervening misconduct eroded any causal connection that might have been suggested by temporal proximity), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 818 (1999); Sturge v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 2010 WL 2813811 at *2 (D. Minn., July 15, 2010)(generally, temporal proximity is not sufficient, standing alone, to demonstrate a causal connection, and "the presence of intervening events undermines any causal inference that a reasonable person might otherwise have drawn from temporal proximity."), quoting Freeman v. Ace Tel. Ass'n, 467 F.3d 695, 698 (8th Cir. 2006). In light of Little's failure to return to work, without having requested a Disability Leave, nor having submitted evidence of the duration and nature of his illness to support his request for a year-long leave, and without any other excuse for his absences, we find that Little's reliance upon temporal proximity raises no genuine issue of fact, and could not permit [*71]  a reasonable inference of discriminatory intent as to his termination.
Further, we find that Little relies too heavily upon cherry-picked statements that, when viewed reasonably, do not demonstrate animus, such as Roy's statements to the Board, on July 18, 2008, that "all the circumstances that this individual might be dealing with on his end of the world are not * * * those issues aren't necessarily ours," and on June 20, 2008, that ARC would "continue to recognize [Little's] medical condition, if it exists through doctor's documentation," which does not even suggest animus, as well as Harris' advice to the ARC staff, with respect to defending ADA claims, and Brenner's purported testimony, which was presented to the Court without citation or context, that a policy of "document, discipline, discharge" for disabled employees would be "good."
On their own, the statements that Little relies upon do not reasonably evince any discriminatory animus and, at the very best, are ambiguous. However, the statements must be taken in light of the entire Record, which demonstrates that ARC made significant efforts to work with Little, in order to understand the problems that he was facing, and allow [*72]  him to go back to work at ARC -- and even allowed him to use sick time and vacation time until his requests for Personal Leave could be resolved. Put into context, the statements are insufficient to raise a reasonable inference that ARC terminated his employment for discriminatory reasons. As a consequence, Little's claim under the MHRA cannot survive the Summary Judgment Motion. See, Tori v. University of Minnesota, supra at *7; Holliday v. Independent Sch. Dist. No. 709, 2006 WL 1738168 at *3 (Minn.App., June 27, 2006)(the plaintiff's failure to raise an inference of age discrimination was fatal to his prima facie showing under the MHRA).
In sum, we find that Little has failed to establish an essential element of his Whistleblower Act claim, because the conduct he reported to ARC was not illegal, even if true; that Little has failed to establish an essential element of his reasonable accommodations claim under the ADA, because no reasonable fact-finder could conclude that ARC failed to engage in the interactive process in good faith, and the accommodation that Little argues should have been provided, is objectively unreasonable; that Little has failed to raise a genuine issue, and ARC terminated Little's employment because of his unexcused absences, and not in retaliation for his requests for accommodations; and that [*73]  Little has failed to establish an essential element of his discriminatory discharge claim, under the MHRA, because he has failed to put forth any evidence that would raise an inference of discrimination in his termination. As a consequence, ARC is entitled to Summary Judgment in its favor, on all of Little's claims, and his Amended Complaint is dismissed with prejudice.
NOW, THEREFORE, It is --
ORDERED:
1. That the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [Docket No. 19] is GRANTED, and that the Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is DISMISSED, with prejudice, in its entirety.
2. That, accordingly, the Clerk of Court is directed to enter Judgment in favor of the Defendant.
BY THE COURT:
Dated: August 19, 2010
