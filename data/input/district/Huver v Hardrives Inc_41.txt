Opinion


ORDER
I. Introduction
This matter came before the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge pursuant to the consent of the parties, see, Title 28 U.S.C. §636(c), upon the Motion of the Defendant Hardrives, Inc., for Summary Judgment.
A Hearing on the Motion was conducted on July 23, 2009, at which time, the Plaintiff Brian Huver appeared by Julie L. Fisk, Esq., and the Defendant appeared by Jonathan P. Norrie, Esq.
For reasons which follow, we grant the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.
II. Factual and Procedural Background
The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant engaged in prohibited disability discrimination, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title 42 U.S.C. §12101, et seq. ("ADA"), the Rehabilitation Act, Title 29 U.S.C. §701, et seq., and the Minnesota Human Rights Act, Minnesota Statutes Section 363A.01, et seq. ("MHRA"), see, Complaint, Docket No. 1-2, at ¶9, when it declined to rehire him [*2]  at the commencement of the 2006 construction season. The Defendant is a paving contractor, which "constructs and paves roads, parking lots, and runways throughout the state of Minnesota and in adjacent states." Declaration of Roberta "Bobbi" Mahn ("First Mahn Decl."), Docket No. 18, at p. 1 ¶2. The "company has divisions in St. Cloud, the Twin Cities, and northern Minnesota." Id. at ¶3.
The Plaintiff was employed by the Defendant, as a seasonal employee, from 1987, to the Fall of 2005. See, Declaration of Brian Huver ("Huver Decl."), Docket No. 25, at p. 1 ¶1. Due to its seasonal nature, the Defendant typically lays off its construction crews at the end of the construction season, in November, and recalls them in the Spring, when the construction work resumes. See, First Mahn Decl., supra at p.1 ¶5. The Plaintiff worked for the Defendant, as a laborer, from 1987 to 1993, when he was transferred to the position of a screed operator.1 See, Huver Decl., supra at p. 1 ¶2. "Individuals in the laborer positions and the screed operators positions belong to different unions." Id. In 2003, the Plaintiff was transferred to a roller operator position,2 which was the position he held when his employment [*3]  with the Defendant ended. Id. at ¶3. During the years that the Plaintiff worked for the Defendant, he never worked at any location other than the St. Cloud division, and he was never asked to work on jobs in the Twin Cities, or in northern Minnesota. Deposition of Brian Huver ("Huver Depo."), Docket No. 17-2, at p. 6 of 32.
Sometime during the Spring of 2006, while the Plaintiff was on layoff status, the Defendant received a copy of a newspaper article, that appeared in the March 20, 2006, [*4]  edition of the St. Cloud Times. See, Huver Depo., Exhibit 1, Docket No. 17-2, at p. 20 of 32. The article reported that the Plaintiff had been involved in a one-car accident, when he "blacked out," causing his truck to go "into a ditch, through a split-rail fence, toppled a tree and crashed into a house."3Id. The house was "heavily damaged," and the Plaintiff's truck "was totaled." Id. Thereafter, when the Plaintiff called the Defendant about returning to work, the Defendant requested that he provide a return to work slip from his doctor.4
The Plaintiff responded to that request with a handwritten note from his physician, Dr. Scott Sakaguchi, which is dated May 26, 2006, and which states, in its entirety: "To whom it may concern -- Brian Huver may return to work." Deposition of Brian Knutson ("Knutson Depo."), Docket No. 17-3, Exhibit 1, at p. 9 of 13. Given the less than illuminating nature of the doctor's note, Brian Knutson ("Knutson"), who is the Defendant's Safety Coordinator, id. at p. 3 of 13, wrote a request to Dr. Sakaguchi which stated, in relevant part, as follows:
Please evaluate [the Plaintiff's] return to work based on the Position description provided [*5]  in this Fax.
Also included is a medical records Release so that we may have a more substantial record of the probable cause and possibility of reoccurrence of "Black-outs."
Knutson Depo., Exhibit 2, supra at p. 7 of 13.
By letter dated June 2, 2006, Dr. Sakaguchi responded, in relevant part, as follows:
[The Plaintiff] has a diagnosis of neurally mediated go. [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] (fainting). In layman's terms, it might be considered a normal reflex which is present in all people, but which is more easily triggered in some individuals. This is a lifelong condition and, as noted, is a reflex which is present in all of us so that any individual could potentially have such a fainting spell. Triggers for this reflex can be identified in some patient's [sic] but, frequently, specific triggers may not be identified. In [the Plaintiff's] case, it seems quite clear that the coughing and choking triggers his spells. He is on pharmacologic therapy to reduce the likelihood or [sic] recurrence. For the last several years, he has averaged about one or two episodes per year. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, we have discussed other general measures that an [sic] reduce the likelihood of his spells. His specific risk [*6]  of syncope at any given time cannot be accurately predicted, but based on his past should be less than or equal to his previous one to two episodes per year.
Id. at pp. 10-11 of 13.
In view of the Defendant's safety concerns, related to the Plaintiff's operation of the roller in close proximity to other workers, the general public, and other equipment, the Defendant decided that he could not return to the roller operator position, because no one could accurately predict when he could be subject to another black out.
The Plaintiff contends, however, that there were other job openings, on the Defendant's workforce, for which he was qualified, by past experience, to hold, and that the Defendant did not offer those positions to him. As a result, the Plaintiff contends that the Defendant disqualified him from all road construction work, because of a perceived disability, that affected his major life activity of work. In response, the Defendant argues that the Plaintiff was not disabled, as that term is defined under either Federal or Minnesota law, and that, even if he were, its decision not to rehire him was supported by the fact that his operation of a roller posed a "direct threat" to the health and safety [*7]  of himself, and to others.
III. Discussion
A. Standard of Review. Summary Judgment is not an acceptable means of resolving triable issues, nor is it a disfavored procedural shortcut when there are no issues which require the unique proficiencies of a Jury in weighing the evidence, and in rendering credibility determinations. See, Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Midwest Oilseeds, Inc. v. Limagrain Genetics Corp., 387 F.3d 705, 711 (8th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 977, 125 S. Ct. 1860, 161 L. Ed. 2d 728 (2005). Summary Judgment is appropriate when we have viewed the facts, and the inferences drawn from those facts, in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and we have found no triable issue. See, Eide v. Grey Fox Technical Servs. Corp., 329 F.3d 600, 604 (8th Cir. 2003); Philip v. Ford Motor Co., 328 F.3d 1020, 1023 (8th Cir. 2003); United Fire & Casualty Co. v. Garvey, 328 F.3d 411, 413 (8th Cir. 2003).
For these purposes, a disputed fact is "material" if it must inevitably be resolved and the resolution will determine the outcome of the case, while a dispute is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable Jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. See, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Planned Parenthood of Minnesota/ South Dakota v. Rounds, 372 F.3d 969, 972 (8th Cir. 2004); Fenney v. Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern R.R. Co., 327 F.3d 707, 711 (8th Cir. 2003).
As Rule 56(e) makes clear, once the moving party files a properly supported Motion, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to demonstrate the existence of a genuine dispute. In sustaining that burden, "an opposing party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading; rather, its response must -- by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule -- set out [*8]  specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial." Rule 56(e), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; see also, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., supra at 256; Eddings v. City of Hot Springs, Ark., 323 F.3d 596, 602 (8th Cir. 2003).
Moreover, the movant is entitled to Summary Judgment where the nonmoving party has failed "to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, supra at 322; see also, Forest Park II v. Hadley, 408 F.3d 1052, 1057 (8th Cir. 2005); Mercer v. City of Cedar Rapids, 308 F.3d 840, 843 (8th Cir. 2002); Hammond v. Northland Counseling Center, Inc., 218 F.3d 886, 891 (8th Cir. 2000). No genuine issue of fact exists in such a case because "a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, supra at 323; see also, Sallis v. University of Minnesota, 408 F.3d 470, 474 (8th Cir. 2005); Davis v. U.S. Bancorp, 383 F.3d 761, 768 (8th Cir. 2004); Bell Lumber and Pole Co. v. United States Fire Ins. Co., 60 F.3d 437, 441 (8th Cir. 1995).
Lastly, "[a]lthough summary judgment is to be used sparingly in employment discrimination cases, it is appropriate where one party has failed to present evidence sufficient to create a jury question as to an essential element of its claim." King v. Hardesty, 517 F.3d 1049, 1057 (8th Cir. 2008), quoting Arnold v. Nursing and Rehabilitation Center at Good Shepherd, 471 F.3d 843, 846 (8th Cir. 2006)[citation omitted]; see also, Mershon v. St. Louis University, 442 F.3d 1069, 1073-74 (8th Cir. 2006),("While summary judgment must be used with caution in discrimination cases due to the fact-specific nature of each case, it nonetheless may be proper 'when a plaintiff fails to establish a factual dispute on an essential element of [the] case.'"), quoting Simpson v. Des Moines Water Works, 425 F.3d 538, 542 (8th Cir. 2005).
B. Legal Analysis. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant regarded him as being disabled because it declined to offer him employment in [*9]  the broad range of jobs of the road construction industry, notwithstanding the availability of those jobs in the Defendant's employ. The Defendant denies that it regarded the Plaintiff as disabled for, it claims, that it simply concluded, on the basis of the opinion of the Plaintiff's own treating physician, that he was unable to safely perform his last previous position as a roller operator.
1. Standard of Review. Although the Plaintiff alleges disability discrimination under three separate statutes, the parties agree that our analysis of his claims can be unified, as the Courts have applied the same analysis under each of the pertinent statutes.5 See, e.g., Kammueller v. Loomis, Fargo & Co., 383 F.3d 779, 784 (8th Cir. 2004)("The MHRA 'materially limits' standard is less stringent than the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") 'substantially limits' standard, Liljedahl v. Ryder Student Transp. Services, Inc., 341 F.3d 836, 841 n. 3 (8th Cir. 2003)[; o]therwise, we analyze cases under the ADA and MHRA with the same standard."), citing Philip v. Ford Motor Co., supra at 1023, and Fenney v. Dakota, Minn. & E.R.R. Co., supra at 711 n. 5; Weber v. Strippit, Inc., 186 F.3d 907, 912 n. 4 (8th Cir. 1999)("The MHRA defines a disability as an impairment that 'materially,' rather than 'substantially' limits one or more major activities, Minn. Stat. §363.01, subd. 13," but "[t]he difference is merely semantic * * *, and we treat the standards the same."), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1078, 120 S. Ct. 794, 145 L. Ed. 2d 670 (2002); Amir v. St. Louis Univ., 184 F.3d 1017, 1029 n. 5 (8th Cir. 1999)("Rehabilitation Act claims are analyzed in a manner similar [*10]  to ADA claims except that the Rehabilitation Act imposes a requirement that a person's disability serve as the sole impetus for a defendant's adverse action against the plaintiff.")[emphasis in original]; Gorman v. Bartch, 152 F.3d 907, 912 (8th Cir. 1998)("The ADA has no federal funding requirement but is otherwise similar in substance to the Rehabilitation Act, and 'cases interpreting either are applicable and interchangeable.'"), quoting Allison v. Dep't of Corrections, 94 F.3d 494, 497 (8th Cir. 1996). As a result, even though our discussion is limited to the ADA, the same analysis applies to the Plaintiff's claims under the MHRA, and the Rehabilitation Act.
Under the ADA, "[a] plaintiff may prove disability by showing that [h]e either (1) has a disability as defined under the ADA, (2) suffers from a history of such a disability, or (3) is perceived by h[is] employer of having such a disability." Snow v. Ridgeview Medical Center, 128 F.3d 1201, 1206 (8th Cir. 1997)[footnote omitted], citing Title 42 U.S.C. §12102(2)(A)-(C); see also, Greer v. Emerson Elec. Co., 185 F.3d 917, 921 (8th Cir. 1999). Here, the Plaintiff does not contend that he actually suffers from a disability -- rather, he maintains that the Defendant perceived him as being disabled when it refused to return him to work in 2006. See, Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition ("Plaintiff's Memorandum"), Docket No. 21, at pp. 2 ("[The Defendant] regarded [the Plaintiff] to be disabled within [*11]  the definition of the ADA and the MHRA based upon his medical condition * * *."), and 7-8 ("[The Defendant] violated the ADA and the MHRA when it regarded [the Plaintiff's] [neurally mediated syncope] condition as substantially limiting his major life activity of working in the road construction industry and refused to hire him for the 2006 road construction season * * *.").
"Disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially (ADA) or materially (MHRA) limits one or more of the plaintiff's major life activities." Snow v. Ridgeview Medical Center, supra at 1206 [footnote omitted]; Finan v. Good Earth Tools, Inc., 565 F.3d 1076, 1079 (8th Cir. 2009). "In order to be regarded as disabled with respect to the major life activity of working, the employer must mistakenly believe that the actual impairment substantially limits the employee's ability to work." Finan v. Good Earth Tools, Inc., supra at 1079, quoting Chalfant v. Titan Distribution, Inc., 475 F.3d 982, 989 (8th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 817, 128 S. Ct. 98, 169 L. Ed. 2d 22 (2007). "The 'regarded as' provision was meant to combat 'archaic attitudes, erroneous perceptions, and myths' working to the disadvantage of the disabled or perceived disabled." Kozisek v. County of Seward, Nebraska, 539 F.3d 930, 935 (8th Cir. 2008), citing Brunko v. Mercy Hosp., 260 F.3d 939, 942 (8th Cir. 2001).
"An employee is substantially limited from working when he is 'significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.'" Christensen v. Titan Distribution, Inc., 481 F.3d 1085, 1093 (8th Cir. 2007), quoting Chalfant v. Titan Distribution, Inc., supra at 989. "If an employer mistakenly [*12]  believes that an employee is unable to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs, then the employer regards the employee as disabled." Id. "However if the employer only mistakenly believes the employee is unable to perform a single job, then the employer does not regard the employee as disabled." Id. "Rather, the impairment must prevent the [person] from performing an entire class or broad range of jobs as compared to the average person possessing comparable training, skills, and abilities." Snow v. Ridgeview Medical Center, supra at 1207 (considering claim under both the ADA, and the MHRA), citing Aucutt v. Six Flags Over Mid-America, Inc., 85 F.3d 1311, 1319 (8th Cir. 1996), citing, in turn, Title 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(j)(3)(I); see also, Wenzel v. Missouri-American Water Co., 404 F.3d 1038, 1041 (8th Cir. 2005) (the plaintiff must show the defendant regarded him as unable to perform a class of jobs).
2. Legal Analysis. The parties' dispute centers upon the availability of jobs in the Defendant's employ, that the Plaintiff was able, by way of his training, experience, and physical capabilities, of performing. The Plaintiff concedes that he is unable to safely perform the requisite job demands of the roller operator position, given his diagnosed neurally mediated syncope.6 However, as we have noted, the Plaintiff asserts that he has created a genuine issue of material fact as to the availability of jobs, [*13]  in the Defendant's workforce, and without regard to geographic location, that he could safely perform. According to the Plaintiff, based upon Dr. Sakaguchi's letter of June 2, 2006, "[the Defendant] decided not to rehire [the Plaintiff] for any position with the company because of his [neurally mediated syncope] condition." Plaintiff's Memorandum, supra at p. 9. For this proposition, the Plaintiff has cited to the deposition testimony of Knutson, and Steven Hall ("Hall"), who was one of the owners of the Defendant, and to the Defendant's letter of December 1, 2006, to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights ("MDHR"). See, Declaration of Julie L. Fisk ("Fisk Decl."), Docket No. 23, Exhibit C [Docket No. 23-3], at p. 3 of 5; Exhibit D [Docket No. 23-4], at pp. 3-4 of 4; and Exhibit F [Docket No. 23-6], at p. 1 of 1.
As to the testimony of Knutson, and Hall, they simply averred that they did not discuss the Plaintiff working in any position, other than as a roller operator, which is not particularly surprising, as the Plaintiff never asked for a job as a laborer, as a screed operator, or as anything other than a roller operator. In this respect, the Plaintiff testified:
Q. After you got [*14]  this information you weren't being recalled, did you ever talk to anybody at [the Defendant] anywhere about getting another job with them?
A. Not that I can recollect, no.
Q. So you have no recollection of ever talking to anybody about coming back to work, for example, as a screed operator?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any recollection you had ever talked to anybody at [the Defendant] about coming to work as a laborer?
A. No, I have never talked to them about it.
Q. As far as you know, that didn't come up during this conversation that you can't remember about the fact you weren't being recalled to your job in the spring of 2006?
A. It never got brought up, no.
Q. Do you know at that time in May and June of 2006 whether there were any vacancies in St. Cloud for laborers? Were they hiring laborers at that time?
A. I wouldn't know that at all.
Q. You wouldn't know that?
A. No.
Q. How about do you know if they were looking for screed operators in St. Cloud at that time?
A. Not that I know of, no.
Q. How about at any other locations either in Rogers or in their northern division office, were they hiring for laborers or screed operators in May and June of 2006 that you know of?
A. I wouldn't know if they were [*15]  or not.
Q. You wouldn't know whether they had any vacant positions?
A. No.
Q. I take it you had never filled out an employment application for any laborers or screed positions at [the Defendant] after May of 2006?
A. No, I never did, no.
Huver Depo., supra at p. 6 of 32.
On the Record before us, the subject of any other position for the Plaintiff, in the Defendant's employee, was never addressed by the parties -- amongst themselves or with the Plaintiff.
With respect to the Defendant's letter of December 1, 2006, Hall, who authored the letter, stated as follows:
A specialist evaluated [the Plaintiff] and could not definitively release him to duty based on the job description because of the unpredictable nature of his condition. It was our decision not to have [the Plaintiff] return to work as a heavy equipment operator due to the safety issues it created. [The Plaintiff] does not possess any other skills useful to accommodate him at any other available position.
Fisk Decl., supra, Exhibit F, Docket No. 23-6, at p. 1 of 1.
The Plaintiff construes this statement as an admission, by the Defendant, that the Plaintiff was disqualified, by his neurally mediated syncope condition, from performing any work in the Defendant's [*16]  employ. Such a construction would be reasonable, and would create a genuine issue of material fact, so as to stave a grant of Summary Judgment, if there were no other pertinent evidence of Record.
Unfortunately for the Plaintiff's claim, however, the Record is not so limited. Rather, the Record is uncontested that, at the time that the Defendant had decided not to return the Plaintiff to his past position as a roller operator, there were no vacancies in the laborer, or screed operator positions, in the St. Cloud division of the company. See, First Mahn Decl., Exhibit 2, Docket No. 18-1, at pp. 3-4 of 15. Indeed, the Record is uncontroverted that, in 2006, the Defendant hired no one to fill vacancies, in either of those two (2) positions, at its St. Cloud division. Id. Given this uncontested Record, we find nothing suspect in Hall's statement, in his letter to the MDHR of December 1, 2006, that, at the time the Plaintiff was not rehired, "[he] d[id] not possess any other skills useful to accommodate him at any other available position." Fisk Decl., supra, Exhibit F, Docket No. 23-6, at p. 1 of 1 [emphasis added].
The Plaintiff argues, however, that the Defendant has two (2) other divisions, where such [*17]  vacancies were available, and there is no dispute as to that fact. See, First Mahn Decl., Exhibit 2, Docket No. 18-1, at pp. 3-4 of 15. Nor is there any dispute, in this Record, that the Defendant's divisions were autonomous when it came to hiring their respective workforces. According to Mahn, who has been employed as the Defendant's Human Resources Manager, and "responsible for staffing positions in all three divisions" since 1999, see, Second Declaration of Mahn ("Second Mahn Decl."), Docket No. 27, at p. 1 ¶1:
For as long as I have been with the company, we have not transferred employees from one division to another. When filling positions for one division, we do not normally consider candidates who live near either of the other two divisions. In the past, I have asked candidates who live near one division to work near a different division, and the answer has always been no. Consequently, when [the Defendant] determined that [the Plaintiff] could not safely perform his job as a roller operator in St. Cloud, I did not even consider whether he would transfer to a laborer position at the Rogers or northern Minnesota divisions. At the time [the Defendant] made that decision about [the [*18]  Plaintiff], there were no open positions in the St. Cloud division for which [the Plaintiff] was qualified. If [the Plaintiff] had applied for one of the Rogers-based laborer jobs (which would have required him to change unions again), I would have considered his application.
Id. at p. 1 ¶2.
The Plaintiff does not disagree. During the course of his deposition, the Plaintiff testified as follows:
Q. Have you always worked out of the St. Cloud office?
A. Yes.
Q. The crew you worked with had always worked out of the St. Cloud office?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember if you were ever asked to work on jobs in the Twin Cities or up north?
A. No.
Q. You don't remember or you weren't?
A. I was never asked, no.
Q. After you got this information you weren't being recalled, did you ever talk to anybody at [the Defendant] anywhere about getting another job with them?
A. Not that I can recollect, no.
Huver Depo., supra at p. 6 of 32.
* * *
Q. Did you ever ask [the Defendant] if you could transfer to some other division down to the Twin Cities or up to the north division?
A. No.
Q. Do you know did other people you know transfer from St. Cloud to the Twin Cities division?
A. Not that I know of, no.
Q. How about to the northern division? [*19] 
A. No.
Q. How about the other way around, do you know if anybody ever transferred from the Twin Cities division up to St. Cloud?
A. I can't think of anybody offhand, no.
Q. How about from the northern division, did anybody transfer from the northern division to St. Cloud?
A. Again, no.
Id. at p. 16 of 32.
There is nothing in the Record presented, which would dispute, however slightly, that the Defendant treated its employees, amongst its divisions, as wholly segregated, such that an employee at one division held no seniority, or employment rights, at another division. Rather than demonstrate, as the Plaintiff suggests, that the failure to offer him employment, at a different division than St. Cloud, and in a job, other than as a roller operator, proved the Defendant's disability animus toward him, the evidence simply shows, according to the totality of the Record presented, that the Defendant chose to operate its business as three separate geographic entities, at least for its employment purposes.7
Contrary to the position urged by the Plaintiff, under the law of this Circuit, the Defendant had no legal obligation to accommodate him so long, [*20]  as he admits, he was not actually disabled. In Weber v. Strippit, Inc., supra at 916-17, "the Eighth Circuit held that the ADA does not require reasonable accommodation of employees who are regarded as disabled," as the "court reasoned that '[i]mposing liability on employers who fail to accommodate non-disabled employees who are simply regarded as disabled would lead to bizarre results." McLain v. Andersen Windows, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15934, 2007 WL 710173 at *3 (D. Minn., March 6, 2007)[internal footnote omitted]. As the Court, in Weber, explained:
Assume, for instance, that Weber's heart condition prevented him from relocating to Akron but did not substantially limit any major life activity. Absent a perceived disability, defendants could terminate Weber without exposing themselves to liability under the ADA. If the hypothetical is altered, however, such that defendants mistakenly perceive Weber's heart condition as substantially limiting one or more major life activities, defendants would be required to reasonably accommodate Weber's condition by, for instance, delaying his relocation to Akron. Although Weber's impairment is no more severe in this example than in the first, Weber would now be entitled to accommodations for a non-disabling impairment that no similarly situated employees would enjoy.
Weber v. Strippit, Inc., supra at 916.
As a consequence, the [*21]  Court concluded that "[t]he ADA cannot reasonably have been intended to create a disparity in treatment among impaired but non-disabled employees," and "h[e]ld that 'regarded as' disabled plaintiffs are not entitled to reasonable accommodations and that the district court did not err in failing to give a reasonable accommodation instruction." Id. at 917.
We recognize that the Circuits are significantly split on this question, with some agreeing with Weber, see, e.g., Kaplan v. City of N. Las Vegas, 323 F.3d 1226, 1231-33 (9th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1049, 124 S. Ct. 821, 157 L. Ed. 2d 697 (2003); Workman v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 165 F.3d 460, 467 (6th Cir. 1999); Newberry v. E. Texas State Univ., 161 F.3d 276, 280 (5th Cir. 1998), and some disagreeing. See, e.g., D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1235 (11th Cir. 2005); Kelly v. Metallics West, Inc., 410 F.3d 670, 675 (10th Cir. 2005); Williams v. Philadelphia Housing Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 773-76 (3rd Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 961, 125 S. Ct. 1725, 161 L. Ed. 2d 602 (2005); Katz v. City of Metal Co., Inc., 87 F.3d 26, 33 (1st Cir. 1996). Nevertheless, Weber continues to be the governing law of this Circuit, and we apply this Circuit's precedents in our decisions. See, Finan v. Good Earth Tools, Inc., supra at 1080 ("Good Earth is correct that an employee who is 'regarded as disabled' is not entitled to a reasonable accommodation."), citing Weber v. Strippit, Inc., supra at 917.8
We accept that "[f]ailing to [*22]  provide an employee with reasonable accommodations can tend to prove that the employer also acted adversely against the employee because of the individual's disability," Kells v. Sinclair Buick-GMC Truck, Inc., 210 F.3d 827, 834 (8th Cir. 2000), but here, the Plaintiff simply presumes that the Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate a perceived disability. He may not, however, defeat a valid claim for Summary Judgment based upon "speculation, conjecture, or fantasy." Schmidt v. City of Bella Villa, 557 F.3d 564, 571 (8th Cir. 2009), citing Putman v. United Health Sys., Inc., 348 F.3d 732, 733-34 (8th Cir. 2003); see also, Bloom v. Metro Heart Group of St. Louis, Inc., 440 F.3d 1025, 1028 (8th Cir. 2006), citing Moody v. St. Charles County, 23 F.3d 1410, 1412 (8th Cir. 1994). The Record before us is bereft of any showing that the Plaintiff requested employment in any other position than that of a roller operator, as to which he concedes he was physically disqualified from holding, or that there were job openings available, at the St. Cloud location, at the time that his rehire, as a roller operator, was denied.
Moreover, the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the Defendant ever hired a job applicant from one location to fill a job vacancy at another. While the Plaintiff can claim that the Defendant should have done so in his instance, the simple fact is that he did not request such a transfer, or position and, given the holding in Weber, the Defendant was not legally obligated to offer a transfer in employment, or a different [*23]  position, where, as here, the Plaintiff suffered from no actual disability under the ADA, the MHRA, or the Rehabilitation Act. The only evidence, which directly bears on the question, is Mahn's attestation that, "[i]f [the Plaintiff] had applied for one of the Rogers-based laborer jobs (which would have required him to change unions again), I would have considered his application" -- an averment that has not been contradicted by any competent evidence of Record. Second Mahn Decl., supra at pp. 1-2 ¶2. Since the Plaintiff failed to carry his burden of establishing a prima facie case of disability discrimination, Summary Judgment in favor of the Defendant is appropriate, and we grant the Defendant's Motion.
NOW, THEREFORE, It is --
ORDERED:
That the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [Docket No. 13] is GRANTED.
Dated: August 3, 2009
BY THE COURT:
