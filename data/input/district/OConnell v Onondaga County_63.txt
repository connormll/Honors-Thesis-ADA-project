MEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff George J. O'Connell brings this action against Defendant Onondaga County, Defendant Onondaga County Sheriff's Department, and Defendant Kevin Walsh, in his official capacity as Sheriff of Onondaga County, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("RA"), and the New York State Human Rights Law Case 5:09-cv-00364-FJS-ATB Document 30 Filed 02/09/12 Page 2 of 37 ("NYHRL").1 See Dkt. No. 11, Amended Complaint. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant took adverse employment actions against him because of his disability and failed to make reasonable accommodations for his disability in violation of the ADA, the RA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983, and the NYHRL. Plaintiff further alleges that, pursuant to New York law, Defendant's conduct constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, [*2]  and breach of contract.
Currently pending before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

II. BACKGROUND2
Plaintiff, a Caucasian male, has been employed as a Deputy Sheriff in the Custody Division of the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department since 1990. On November 7, 1993, Plaintiff injured his left shoulder while attempting to prevent an inmate from committing suicide. Pursuant to Department policy and procedure, Plaintiff reported his on-the-job injury the next day. As a result of this injury, on November 11, 1993, Plaintiff's primary care physician recommended that he remain out of work until cleared by an orthopedic physician. On November 15, 1993, Dr. James Newman, an orthopedic physician, examined Plaintiff and authorized him to return to work the next day but recommended that he only perform "desk work." Plaintiff's job duties were temporarily modified accordingly.
By December 27, 1993, Plaintiff returned to "full duty" work with the sole restriction that he should not work overtime until February 1994. Since Plaintiff's shoulder injury continued to cause him pain, Dr. Newman recommended that he undergo a distal clavicle excision [*3]  surgery. On March 2, 1994, Dr. Newman determined Plaintiff to be "totally disabled" from his duties as a custody deputy; and, on May 20, 1994, Plaintiff underwent the surgical procedure that Dr. Newman had recommended. Plaintiff returned to work on August 22, 1994, with several physical medical restrictions, and his work assignments were again temporarily modified accordingly.
Plaintiff suffered another on-the-job injury to his left shoulder in January 1996 while attempting to lift a crate. On July 1, 1996, he underwent a second surgery and was advised to refrain from work until notified otherwise. Plaintiff was authorized to return to work on September 30, 1996. At that time, he was medically deemed capable of performing full duty work without restrictions other than, again, avoiding overtime hours.
Periodically, over the next several years, Plaintiff visited Dr. Newman due to recurring pain and spasms in his left shoulder and arm. On June 10, 1999, Dr. Newman indicated that, although Plaintiff may continue to experience "acute exacerbations of this pain," he would "not limit [Plaintiff] at all from anything permanently however when he has discomfort, avoiding cross-over maneuvers will [*4]  keep [Plaintiff] more comfortable." See Dkt. No. 22, Affidavit of Thomas J. Metz dated February 11, 2011 ("Metz Aff."), Exh. "N" attached thereto. Dr. Newman further stated that "unfortunately there is little more that [he could] provide for [Plaintiff]," and he "strongly encourage[d] [Plaintiff] to continue to deal with this as best as he can." See id. During a subsequent visit on December 20, 2000, Dr. Newman stated that Plaintiff could return to full duty work without restriction the following day. See Metz Aff., Exhs. "Q" & "R" attached thereto.
In November 2000, Dr. W. David Ferraraccio, an orthopedic surgeon, conducted an independent medical examination of Plaintiff to assist in the resolution of an ongoing Workers' Compensation claim. Dr. Ferraraccio determined that Plaintiff had a cumulative 50% "loss of use" in his left arm — 40% reduction in range of motion and 10% loss of bone. See Metz Aff., Exh. "P" attached thereto. Dr. Ferraraccio concluded that he expected Plaintiff to have "recurring temporary flare-ups as he ha[d] experienced over the past two or three years" and that Plaintiff "ha[d] reached maximum medical improvement." See id. Following the Workers Compensation hearing held on April [*5]  27, 2001, Plaintiff received a "schedule award" for lost time due to his 50% loss of use in his left arm. See Metz Aff., Exh. "S" attached thereto.
In December 2002, Plaintiff and the Deputy Sheriff's Benevolent Association of Onondaga County, Inc. ("DSBA")3 entered into a settlement agreement with Defendant stemming from four disciplinary charges filed against him in 2002. As part of that settlement agreement, Plaintiff agreed to submit an application for disability retirement to the New York State and Local Retirement System, and Defendant agreed to drop the disciplinary charges against Plaintiff. On January 4, 2005, the New York State and Local Retirement System denied Plaintiff's application for disability retirement, finding that he "[was] not permanently incapacitated for the performance of duties." See Metz Aff., Exh. "V" attached thereto.
On October 3, 2006, Plaintiff reaggravated his left shoulder during a "pod shakedown," and he filed another injury report in that regard. See Metz Aff, Exh. "W" attached thereto. Also on October 3, 2006, Plaintiff began to make written requests to Defendant to accommodate his disability by placing him in a light duty position. In response, Kathy [*6]  Homestead, Defendant's Personnel Officer, sent Plaintiff a memorandum regarding his request for an ADA accommodation. Among other things, she asked Plaintiff to provide a formal written request for an ADA accommodation and a physician statement that identified his disability. In response, on January 8, 2007, Plaintiff provided Lieutenant Thomas Metz ("Lieutenant Metz"), Defendant's Human Resources Manager, with a handwritten letter request for an accommodation, a Work Limitation/Restriction form restricting him from overtime, and documents from Dr. Lara Cain regarding his physical condition. The medical documentation that Dr. Cain provided indicated that it would be appropriate to place Plaintiff in a position better suited for his disability; still, however, she released him to full duty work with the caveat that he should avoid overtime.
During a meeting on January 31, 2007, to discuss Plaintiff's requests to be reassigned, Plaintiff reiterated his interest in a light duty position that required less inmate contact, such as a desk job that involved working with a computer. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's lack of computer training disqualified him from such a position, but Plaintiff [*7]  alleges that these positions were routinely given to those in need of light duty. Although Defendant reviewed other such "unique mission positions," it determined that Plaintiff lacked the requisite skill and training for these positions as well. Defendant further contends that assigning Plaintiff to a permanent light duty position "was not feasible" because the DSBA would not support putting someone with less seniority in a permanent position due to a disability because such positions were subject to a bidding process. Plaintiff disputes this assertion.
Another physician, Dr. Warren Silverman, conducted an independent medical examination of Plaintiff on July 17, 2007, at the behest of Lieutenant Metz. Dr. Silverman determined that, although Plaintiff exhibited some questionable limitations in his left shoulder's range of motion, there was no evidence that Plaintiff had a permanent impairment that substantially limited any of his major life activities. See Dkt. No. 18-3, Affidavit of Warren Silverman dated January 18, 2011 ("Silverman Aff."), Exh. "B" attached thereto. Dr. Silverman concluded, based on an examination of Plaintiff and a rather extensive review of his lengthy medical [*8]  records, that Plaintiff was capable of performing his full duty functions as a custody deputy without any restrictions or limitations. See id.
Also relevant are the following three arbitration proceedings in which Plaintiff and Defendant engaged.
On August 10, 2006, Arbitrator Louis V. Imundo, Jr., found that Defendant subjected Plaintiff to disparate treatment and that it did not have just cause to terminate or even discipline him for his record of absences. Defendant had brought twelve charges against Plaintiff, all based on absences without leave, dating from April 2, 2001, until February 17, 2005. Arbitrator Imundo ordered that Defendant drop all charges and expunge them from Plaintiff's record and directed Defendant to "make a good faith effort to provide some form of job/work accommodation for [Plaintiff]." See Dkt. No. 24, Exh. 3 attached thereto. Defendant unsuccessfully appealed this decision to the New York State Supreme Court, which confirmed the award on September 12, 2007.
On January 28, 2009, Plaintiff and the DSBA sought arbitration against Defendant due to disciplinary charges and a ten-day suspension that Defendant levied against him on January 23, 2009, for four offenses [*9]  that occurred in 2007. Arbitrator Joyce M. Klein found that three of the four charges were unsubstantiated and dismissed them; and, further, she reversed the ten-day suspension and awarded Plaintiff any lost back pay and benefits.
Finally, a third arbitration was held on December 15, 2009, before Arbitrator Clifford B. Donn arising from a September 11, 2008 incident in which Defendant disciplined Plaintiff for complaining about having to work overtime. Defendant levied formal charges against Plaintiff on July 22, 2009, and suspended him for twenty days. On January 30, 2010, Arbitrator Donn found that Defendant had continued to refuse to comply with Arbitrator Imundo's order that it make a good faith effort to accommodate Plaintiff. Arbitrator Donn concluded that Defendant did not have just cause to discipline Plaintiff; and, accordingly, he dismissed all charges against Plaintiff and awarded him any lost pay and benefits.
On October 11, 2006, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the New York State Division of Human Rights ("NYSDHR") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). The EEOC issued a right to sue letter on December 30, 2008; and, on March 29, 2009, [*10]  Plaintiff commenced this action against Defendant. On December 18, 2009, Plaintiff filed his amended complaint, in which he alleged the following eight causes of action: (1) violations of the ADA for disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation; (2) violations of the NYHRL for disability discrimination and retaliation; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (4) negligent infliction of emotional distress; (5) breach of contract; (6) unspecified violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1981; (7) unspecified violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and (8) violations of the RA for disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation.

III. DISCUSSION

A. Standard of review
Summary judgment is warranted when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The burden is initially on the moving party to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323. The Court must view all facts, draw all inferences, and resolve all ambiguities in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (quotation omitted).

B. Disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation claims under the ADA (first cause of action) [*11]  and the RA (eighth cause of action)4
The ADA prohibits discrimination in the workplace "on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Courts analyze claims of discrimination under the ADA according to the burden-shifting test set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). Under such an analysis, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. See Ryan v. Grae & Rybicki, P.C., 135 F.3d 867, 869 (2d Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).
To be entitled to the protections of the ADA, a plaintiff must qualify as "disabled" under the statute. See Jacques v. DiMarzio, Inc., 386 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted). The ADA Amendments Act (the "ADAAA") of 2008, which became effective as of January 1, 2009, broadened the definition of a disability under the ADA (and, by express inclusion, the RA). See ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325 (2008). However, the ADAAA does not apply retroactively to claims that arose prior to its effective date, January 1, 2009. See Wega v. Ctr. for Disability Rights, Inc., 395 Fed. Appx. 782, 784 n.1 (2d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted); DiFillippo v. Special Metals Corp., No. 6:09-CV-760, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112589, 2011 WL 4595204, *9 n.2 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2011) (citations omitted); Parada v. Banco Indus. de Venezuela, C.A., No. 10 Civ. 0883, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14799, 2011 WL 519295, *4 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2011) (citations omitted).
In this case, Plaintiff alleges discriminatory conduct that occurred [*12]  both before and after January 1, 2009. Therefore, the Court will address Plaintiff's claims based on conduct that occurred prior to January 1, 2009, separately from his claims that are based on conduct that occurred after that date.

1. Disability under the ADA
The ADA defines disability as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Plaintiff contends that he is disabled under each of these provisions. Defendant contends that the Court should summarily dismiss Plaintiff's claims pursuant to the ADA and the RA because he does not qualify as disabled.

a. Physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities
Prior to the ADAAA, in determining whether an individual had a disability for purposes of the ADA, the Second Circuit had adopted the three-step approach that the Supreme Court outlined in Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1998). See Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of City of New York, 287 F.3d 138, 147 (2d Cir. 2002) (quotations omitted). Under this analysis, a plaintiff must establish the following: (1) he suffers from a physical or mental impairment; (2) the impairment affects a major life activity; [*13]  and (3) the impairment substantially limits that major life activity. See id. (quotations omitted). The plaintiff must satisfy each element for his condition to qualify as an ADA-recognized disability. See Colwell v. Suffolk Cnty. Police Dep't, 158 F.3d 635, 641 (2d Cir. 1998), superseded by statute on other grounds by 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A).

(1). Physical or mental impairment
The pre-ADAAA EEOC regulations defined physical impairment as "[a]ny physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological [or] musculoskeletal . . . ." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h)(1).5 In this case, Defendant concedes that Plaintiff's 50% loss of use of his left shoulder qualifies as a "physical impairment" within the meaning of the ADA since it is a physiological disorder affecting the musculoskeletal system. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has a physical impairment to his left shoulder.

(2). Major life activity
Next, Plaintiff must identify the activity or activities claimed to be impaired and establish that it constitutes a "major life activity" under the ADA. Major life activities include "'functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working'" as well as "'sitting, [*14]  standing, lifting, or reaching.'" Colwell, 158 F.3d at 642 (quotations omitted). In this case, Plaintiff alleges that his disability affects the following major life activities: "his ability to lift, balance himself, reach above his head, shovel snow, lift or carry his children, or to complete every day tasks of bathing, cooking, washing of dishes or clothing, sweeping, [and] work . . . ." See Amended Complaint at ¶ 12. Not all of the activities that Plaintiff lists are considered "major life activities" within the meaning of the ADA. However, Plaintiff has identified the following activities — lifting, balancing, reaching, performing manual tasks, caring for oneself, and working — which are "major life activities" under the ADA. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently shown that his "physical impairment" impacts a "major life activity."

(3). Substantially limits
Finally, to establish a disability under the ADA, it is not enough for a physical impairment to merely impact a major life activity; the plaintiff must further demonstrate that his physical impairment "substantially limits" one or more of these major life activities. Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to show a substantial [*15]  limitation in this regard.
Under the pre-ADAAA EEOC regulations, "substantially limits" meant "[u]nable to perform a major life activity that the average person" could perform, or "[s]ignificantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual [could] perform a particular major life activity as compared to" the average person. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1). Factors a court may consider in this analysis include (1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (3) the permanent or long-term impact, or the expected permanent or long-term impact, of the impairment. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(2). With respect to the major life activity of working, the EEOC regulations provided that
[t]he term substantially limits means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.
The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i).
Mere temporary or transitory restrictions are not "substantially limiting" and thus do not typically render a person "disabled" under the [*16]  ADA. See Adams v. Citizens Advice Bureau, 187 F.3d 315, 316-17 (2d Cir. 1999) (quotation omitted); Murray v. Sysco Corp., No. CIV96CV1073, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4503, 1998 WL 160826, *5 (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 1998). Further, "'[i]ntermittent, episodic impairments are not disabilities.'" Horwitz v. L & J.G. Stickley, Inc., 122 F. Supp. 2d 350, 356 (N.D.N.Y. 2000) (quotation omitted).
In this case, Plaintiff has presented evidence that his left shoulder is permanently damaged because he has a 50% loss of use of his left arm; and, as a result, he suffers from chronic flare-ups of pain and sometimes experiences "intense pain and a locked shoulder." See Dkt. No. 24, Exh. 1, Affidavit of Plaintiff George J. O'Connell dated March 21, 2011 ("Plaintiff Aff."), at ¶¶ 12-13. This pain allegedly interferes with his mobility and substantially limits the other major life activities identified above. See id. at ¶ 13. Plaintiff testified that, on "bad days," he is bed-ridden, experiences spasms, and has pain that reduces him to tears. See id. at ¶ 14; Deposition Transcript of Plaintiff George J. O'Connell dated August 20, 2010 ("Plaintiff Tr."), at 89-91. He further testified that he has experienced up to two months of consecutive "bad days" in which he suffered extreme pain on a daily basis. See Plaintiff Tr. at 92-93. Moreover, Plaintiff claims that he has a limited range of motion in his left arm and that he is unable to lift [*17]  certain heavy objects. See Plaintiff Tr. at 89-90; Plaintiff Aff. at ¶¶ 13-14. The majority of these statements are supported by physician's reports, an independent medical examination in 2000, a Workers Compensation award in 2001, and the three arbitration awards discussed above. See Metz Aff., Exhs. "H," "K," & "S" attached thereto; Dkt. No. 24.
Defendant, on the other hand, has submitted evidence tending to show that Plaintiff was only temporarily disabled. See Metz Aff., Exh. "V" attached thereto (denying Plaintiff's application for disability retirement due to NYS's determination that he was not permanently incapacitated from the performance of duties); Metz Aff., Exh. "N" attached thereto (Dr. Newman indicating in June 1999 that, although Plaintiff may continue to experience "acute exacerbations of [] pain," he would "not limit [Plaintiff] at all from anything permanently however when he has discomfort, avoiding cross-over maneuvers will keep [Plaintiff] more comfortable"). Defendant also points to Plaintiff's deposition testimony in which he analogized the pain in his left shoulder to a "minor toothache" and stated that, when he is at his "baseline," he is capable of caring for [*18]  himself and performing his job duties. See Plaintiff Tr. at 31-32, 90-91, 103-105.
As stated, Plaintiff claims that he is either "unable" or "significantly restricted" in his ability to lift, balance, reach, perform manual tasks, care for himself, and work. As to balancing, performing manual tasks, and caring for himself, Plaintiff has introduced no evidence to support a finding that he is substantially limited in this regard. As to lifting, reaching, and working, aside from Plaintiff's 50% loss of use in his left arm, for the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that there is insufficient evidence in the record to create an issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff is substantially limited in the performance of these major life activities for purposes of the ADA.
First, Plaintiff's "reliance on his permanent injury rating is not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish that he is disabled where the record shows that [the] permanent impairment does not substantially limit any of his major life activities." Lajeunesse v. Great Atl. & Pacific Tea Co., Inc., 160 F. Supp. 2d 324, 332 (D. Conn. 2001) (citations omitted). In addition, pain, standing alone, does not constitute a disability. See Dumas v. Schweiker, 712 F.2d 1545, 1552 (2d Cir. 1983); Boyd v. City of N.Y. Parks & Recreation, No. 05 Civ. 6962, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114735, 2008 WL 5092841, *7 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 2, 2008) (citations omitted).
Plaintiff is currently working as a Deputy Sheriff without restrictions. [*19]  When asked if there was any task that he could not perform because of his shoulder limitations, Plaintiff testified: "I do whatever I'm ordered to do to the best of my ability. There's things I shouldn't be doing — like, I do cell searches all the time. I'm picking up crates; I'm picking up things that I shouldn't be doing." See Plaintiff Tr. at 73-74. As one example of his physical restrictions, Plaintiff testified that he dropped a microwave that he was attempting to lift during the cell search of an inmate because his shoulder was not strong enough to support it. See id. at 74. A lifting restriction, in and of itself, does not constitute a disability under the ADA. See Colwell, 158 F.3d at 644-45; Huskins v. Pepsi Cola of Ogdensburg Bottlers, Inc., 180 F. Supp. 2d 347, 352 (N.D.N.Y. 2001) (quotation and other citation omitted); Varre v. City of Syracuse, No. 96-CV-1792, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2688, 2000 WL 270966, *5 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 2000) (collecting cases).
Following his voluminous absences from work, several doctors' reports and notes over the years indicated that Plaintiff was capable of returning to full duty work without medical restrictions. Although the doctors' notes do not preclude a finding that Plaintiff was "significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration" under which he was able to work, the Court finds Dr. Newman's notes to be particularly persuasive evidence that Plaintiff was medically [*20]  capable of working full duty and without restrictions.6
Plaintiff also testified that his work environment was somewhat physically demanding and that his physical limitations hindered his ability to dutifully perform certain tasks. See Plaintiff Tr. at 73-74, 165-68. However, he admittedly continued to work without restrictions, even if he did so with some difficulty and apprehension about his ability to protect himself and others. See id. at 163-65. Further, Plaintiff testified that "[m]ost of the job is 90 percent watching, seeing what's going on and, you know, just being a problem solver." See id. at 88-89.
Even viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the record does not support a finding that Plaintiff was substantially limited in a broad range of jobs, and perhaps not even in the specific job of Deputy Sheriff. Accordingly, the Court finds that, although Plaintiff has shown that his physical impairment affects his ability to lift, reach, and work, he has not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it substantially limits those activities. Indeed,
[a]lthough almost any impairment may, of course, in some way affect a major life activity, the ADA clearly does not consider every impaired person to [*21]  be disabled. Thus, in assessing whether a plaintiff has a disability, courts have been careful to distinguish impairments which merely affect major life activities from those that substantially limit those activities.
Ryan, 135 F.3d at 870 (citation omitted).7
Therefore, at the time Defendant allegedly took adverse employment actions against Plaintiff prior to 2009, the Court finds that Plaintiff was not "unable" or "significantly restricted" in his ability to lift, balance, reach, perform manual tasks, care for himself, or work because he was not "substantially limited" in these activities. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff was not actually disabled under the ADA.

b. Record of impairment
Plaintiff may still qualify as disabled under the ADA without a showing of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity by establishing "'a record of such an impairment[.]'" Colwell, 158 F.3d at 641 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102[(2)(B)] (1994)). This "'ensure[s] that people are not discriminated against because of a history of disability.'" Id. at 645 (quotation omitted). The EEOC regulations defined "record of impairment" as where a person "has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that [*22]  substantially limits one or more major life activities." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(k)(1). Accordingly, the record on which the employer relied must indicate that the individual had or has a substantially limiting impairment. See Colwell, 158 F.3d at 645.
Here, Plaintiff alleges that his medical history, which includes several years of medical documentation reflecting the extent of his shoulder injury, constitutes a record of physical impairment that substantially limited the major life activity of working.8 Plaintiff first underwent a surgical procedure to his left shoulder on May 20, 1994, and he returned to work on August 22, 1994, with several physical restrictions. On July 1, 1996, Plaintiff underwent a second surgery and returned to work on September 30, 1996, with no physical restrictions. Thereafter, Plaintiff continued to miss work frequently due to recurring shoulder pain, but his doctors continued to authorize him to return to work without restrictions.
Even given this medical history, however, for the reasons discussed above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated a record of a substantially limiting physical impairment in his ability to work. See id. at 646 (holding that "one month in the hospital and six months at home," which [*23]  amounted to "a seven-month impairment of [the plaintiff's] ability to work, [coupled] with the non-particularized and unspecific residual limitations [on the plaintiff's] work, [was] too short a duration and too vague an extent to be 'substantially limiting[]'" (citations omitted)); Horwitz v. L & J.G. Stickley, Inc., 20 Fed. Appx. 76, 80 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding that "past hospitalization, even coupled with continued treatment, does not create a record of a substantially limiting medical condition" (citation omitted)); Owens v. Longo, No. 06-CV-0281, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 985, 2008 WL 84594, *6 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 7, 2008) (stating that "a plaintiff will not automatically be found disabled upon presentation of records of a medical appointment or surgery regarding an impairment"; but, rather, the employer must have relied on a record that indicates "a 'substantially limiting impairment'" (quotation and other citations omitted)).
Plaintiff has unquestionably demonstrated a record of an impairment, but it is not a record of a substantially limiting impairment for purposes of the ADA. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff cannot establish that he has a disability under the ADA because of a "record of impairment."

c. Regarded as impaired
The third way in which a plaintiff may qualify as disabled under the ADA is to prove that the defendant "'regarded [him] [*24]  as'" having an impairment that substantially limited one or more of the major life activities.9 Colwell, 158 F.3d at 641 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102[(2)(C)] (1994)). "[W]hether an individual is 'regarded as' having a disability 'turns on the employer's perception of the employee' and is therefore 'a question of intent, not whether the employee has a disability.'" Id. at 646 (quotation omitted). In order to qualify as disabled under this prong of the ADA's definition of "disability," a plaintiff must show that the employer regarded him as disabled within the meaning of the ADA, i.e., that the employer regarded him as having an impairment that substantially limited one or more of the major life activities at issue. See Brtalik v. South Huntington Union Free Sch. Dist., No. CV-10-0010, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107373, 2010 WL 3958430, *8 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 6, 2010) (citation omitted).
As Defendant correctly notes, "the crux of Plaintiff's claim is that Defendant[] repeatedly ignored his claims that he was disabled and refused to accommodate him by assigning him to light duty." See Dkt. 18-18, at 12-13. The fact that Defendant continues to allow Plaintiff to perform all of his job duties without limitations indicates that it did not "'perceive[] [him] to be incapable of working in a broad range of jobs' suitable for [a person] [*25]  of [his] age, experience, and training." Colwell, 158 F.3d at 647 (citation omitted). The evidence is clear that Defendant did not regard Plaintiff as substantially limited in his ability to work, lift, or reach; and, thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff cannot establish that he has a disability under this prong of the ADA's definition of disability because Defendant did not "regard him as" impaired.
In sum, for all of these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff does not suffer from a disability within the meaning of the ADA as it existed prior to the effective date of the ADAAA.

2. Disability discrimination and failure to accommodate claims under the ADA
Since Plaintiff is unable to establish the first element of his prima facie case — that is, that he is an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA prior to January 1, 2009 — the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment with regard to Plaintiff's disability discrimination and failure to accommodate claims in his first (ADA) and eighth (RA) causes of action insofar as they relate to conduct occurring prior to January 1, 2009.

3. Retaliation claim under the ADA
Although the Court finds that Plaintiff is not disabled within the meaning [*26]  of the ADA prior to the applicability of the ADAAA, "[t]he fact that plaintiff was not actually disabled within the meaning of the ADA does not affect his retaliation claim, since the statute requires only that he have contacted the EEOC with the good-faith belief that the [defendant's] conduct was unlawful under the ADA." Taylor v. Lenox Hill Hosp., No. 00 Civ. 3773, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5429, 2003 WL 1787118, *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 3, 2003) (citations omitted).
Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, he has alleged that Defendant retaliated against him in violation of the ADA and the RA when it disciplined him on several occasions and sought to have him terminated because he asked for reasonable accommodations.10 See Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 16, 18-22, 24, 55, 61. Defendant contends that the Court should dismiss this claim because Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient notice in his EEOC charge of a claim for retaliation under the ADA.
Even if a plaintiff does not expressly raise an ADA retaliation claim in his EEOC charge, he may still bring such a claim if it is based on conduct that is "reasonably related" to the allegations in the EEOC charge. See Butts v. City of N.Y. Dep't of Hous. Pres. & Dev., 990 F.2d 1397, 1401 (2d Cir. 1993), superseded by statute on other grounds, Pub. L. No. 102-166 (citations omitted). The Second Circuit recognizes three such situations where unexhausted claims [*27]  may be "reasonably related" to the conduct alleged in the EEOC charge: (1) "where the conduct complained of would fall within the 'scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination'"; (2) where the "claim is one alleging retaliation by an employer against an employee for filing an EEOC charge"; and (3) "where a plaintiff alleges further incidents of discrimination carried out in precisely the same manner alleged in the EEOC charge." Id. at 1402-03 (quotation and other citations omitted). The first type of "reasonably related" claim is "essentially an allowance of loose pleading," recognizing that "EEOC charges frequently are filled out by employees without the benefit of counsel and that their primary purpose is to alert the EEOC to the discrimination that a plaintiff claims [he] is suffering . . . ." Id. at 1402 (citations omitted).
Here, Plaintiff's EEOC charge contained allegations corresponding to those he now raises in his amended complaint. His EEOC charge stated that Defendant ignored Arbitrator Imundo's binding decision by continuing to deny Plaintiff's requests for reasonable accommodation in the form of light duty assignments on account of [*28]  his disability. See Dkt. No. 29, Plaintiff's EEOC Charge. Plaintiff further alleged that Defendant informed Plaintiff that he could be terminated "after the April 17, 2007 hearing in which [Defendant] plans to state that [Plaintiff's] dismissal is predicated on [his] time and attendance record." See id. Accordingly, Plaintiff's allegations in support of his retaliation claim are substantially similar to those included in his original EEOC complaint. Moreover, although some acts of alleged retaliation occurred before Plaintiff filed his EEOC charge, the "'reasonably related' test is not limited to plaintiffs alleging post-charge conduct." Francis v. City of N.Y., 235 F.3d 763, 766 (2d Cir. 2000) (footnote omitted). It is, therefore, "reasonable to conclude that Plaintiff gave the EEOC notice of these incidents." Butts, 990 F.2d at 1403; see Ridgway v. Metro. Museum of Art, No. 06 Civ. 5055, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27007, 2007 WL 1098737, *5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 10, 2007) (holding that the plaintiff's retaliation claim was reasonably related to his disability discrimination claim included in his EEOC charge where the charge alleged that he had requested reasonable accommodation, that his requests had been denied, and that he was subsequently terminated).
For these reasons, the conduct about which Plaintiff complains in his retaliation claim would fall within the scope of the EEOC investigation [*29]  that could reasonably be expected to grow out of his EEOC charge. Since Plaintiff's retaliation claim in his amended complaint is reasonably related to the allegations in his EEOC charge, the Court finds that he may bring this claim despite his failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
To establish a retaliation claim under the ADA, the plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) his employer was aware of this activity; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Lovejoy-Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 223 (2d Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted).
In the instant case, Plaintiff engaged in a protected activity when he repeatedly sought a reasonable accommodation in the form of light duty assignments at work. Defendant was aware of this activity because Plaintiff made such requests both in writing and orally through the appropriate channels. In addition, Plaintiff has alleged various actions that might constitute adverse employment actions, including reprimands, suspensions without pay, indeterminate furlough of pay, threats of termination, and an attempted termination. Finally, Plaintiff has come forward with evidence [*30]  tending to show that a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.11a
Accordingly, the Court concludes that there is sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact with regard to Plaintiff's retaliation claims under the ADA and the RA.12

4. Disability under the ADAAA
As stated, since Plaintiff has alleged conduct that occurred both before and after the effective date of the ADAAA, i.e., January 1, 2009, the Court will apply the ADAAA to the extent that Plaintiff's amended complaint alleges conduct that occurred after January 1, 2009. See Rumbin v. Ass'n of Am. Med. Colls., 803 F. Supp. 2d 83, 92 n.4 (D. Conn. 2011) (citations omitted).
Under the ADAAA, the definition of "disability" was substantially broadened. See ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325 (2008). It provides a more expansive interpretation of the term "substantially limited" so as to expand the class of individuals entitled to protection under the ADA. See id. Unlike the former standards for interpreting ADA claims, the ADAAA rejects an interpretation of "substantially limited" to mean "significantly restricted." See id. Following the implementation of the ADAAA, the EEOC regulations now define "substantially limits," in pertinent part, as follows:
(ii) An impairment [*31]  is a disability within the meaning of this section if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section.
(iii) The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Accordingly, the threshold issue of whether an impairment "substantially limits" a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis.
(iv) The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity . . . . shall be interpreted and applied to require a degree of functional limitation that is lower than the standard for "substantially limits" applied prior to the ADAAA.
* * *
(vii) An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability [*32]  if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1). The appendix to the final EEOC regulations further provides, among other things, the following:
In keeping with the findings and purposes of the [ADAAA], the determination of coverage under the law should not require extensive and elaborate assessment, and the EEOC and the courts are to apply a lower standard in determining when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, including the major life activity of working, than they applied prior to the [ADAAA].
Negron v. City of New York, No. 10 CV 2757, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119463, 2011 WL 4737068, *11 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, 2011) (quotation omitted).
Under the ADAAA, to determine whether a plaintiff's impairment substantially limits his ability to work or engage in other major life activities, the court considers the effect of the plaintiff's seemingly episodic impairment when it is active. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(D); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(vii). Indeed, the ADAAA expressly provides that "[a]n impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(D); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(vii). The prior version of the ADA did not include this language.
In this case, Plaintiff alleges that when his shoulder injury is active — i.e., "flares-up" — he is nearly incapacitated, which may render him temporarily [*33]  incapable of working or performing other major life activities.
Furthermore, with respect to the major life activity of working, the EEOC regulations explain that, under the ADAAA "the terms 'class of jobs' and 'broad range of jobs in various classes' will [now] be applied in a more straightforward and simple manner than they were applied by the courts prior to the [ADAAA]." 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, Appendix, Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act. A "class of jobs"
may be determined by reference to the nature of the work that an individual is limited in performing (such as . . . law enforcement jobs) or by reference to job-related requirements that an individual is limited in meeting (for example, jobs requiring repetitive bending, reaching, or manual tasks, jobs requiring repetitive or heavy lifting, prolonged sitting or standing . . .).
Id.
Accordingly, given the more liberal standard for what qualifies as a disability under the ADAAA, Plaintiff's two several-month-long absences from work and his allegations that he suffers ongoing debilitating "flare-ups" may result in his being "actually disabled" from the major life activity of work because his impairment substantially [*34]  may limit his ability to perform not only the unique tasks required of a Deputy Sheriff, but also a broader range of comparable jobs in various classes. Therefore, the Court finds that an issue of fact exists with respect to whether or not Plaintiff qualifies as disabled under the ADAAA's broader definition of disability.

5. Disability discrimination and failure to accommodate claims under the post-ADAAA ADA and the RA13

a. Disability discrimination claim under the ADAAA
In order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must show that (1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) he suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability. See Jacques, 386 F.3d at 198 (quotation omitted).
In this case, Plaintiff has satisfied the first prima facie element because Defendant is an employer subject to the ADA. He has also satisfied, at least for purposes of this motion, the second element because, as discussed, he has created an issue of fact regarding whether he qualifies as disabled within the meaning of [*35]  the ADA, as amended, effective January 1, 2009. Third, Plaintiff must establish that he was qualified to perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation. Since Plaintiff is currently performing his full duty functions as a custody deputy without medical restrictions or limitations — a point which Defendant concedes and uses to support its argument that Plaintiff does not qualify as disabled — he has satisfied this element. Finally, as previously discussed, Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not Defendant took adverse action against him.14
Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has established his prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA with respect to the two arbitration proceedings from 2009.15

b. Failure to accommodate claim under the ADAAA
Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim is premised on his assertion that, in direct disregard for Arbitrator Imundo's order that Defendant "make a good faith effort to provide some form of job/work accommodation for [Plaintiff]," Defendant has failed to do so. Plaintiff has presented evidence that there [*36]  are light duty positions available that would not require the creation of a new position and that he is qualified for such positions. See Plaintiff Aff. at ¶¶ 7-10, 18, 21; Dkt. No. 26, Exh. 7, Affidavit of Arthur Barksdale dated December 20, 2010, at ¶¶ 6-12; Dkt. No. 26, Exh. 7(b), Affidavit of Danny Matthews dated December 29, 2010, at ¶¶ 6-7, 9, 10-12; Dkt. No. 26, Exh. 8, Affidavit of Walter Rys dated July 15, 2010, at ¶¶ 5-7, 9, 12-18. Furthermore, in one of the arbitration proceedings from 2009, see Dkt. No. 25, Exh. 5, Arbitrator Donn ultimately ruled in Plaintiff's favor, finding, among other things, that Defendant "has refused to provide the good faith effort at accommodation or light duty work that Arbitrator Imundo ordered." See id.
Defendant has presented evidence that, to the contrary, there are no permanent light duty positions available. See Metz Aff. at ¶¶ 34-44; Dkt. No. 18-6, Affidavit of Kevin Brisson dated February 8, 2011, at ¶¶ 5-7, 11, 19-21.
During the relevant post-January 1, 2009 timeframe, when Plaintiff and Defendant were engaged in two arbitration proceedings stemming from various charges against Plaintiff, the Court finds that genuine issues of material [*37]  fact exist as to whether a reasonable accommodation existed in the form of a light-duty position for which Plaintiff was qualified and, if such a position existed, whether Defendant, by not placing Plaintiff in one of these positions, thereby failed to make a reasonable accommodation.16 Accordingly, the Court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim insofar as that claim relates to conduct that occurred after January 1, 2009.
In sum, for the above-stated reasons, with respect to Plaintiff's first (ADA) and eighth (RA) causes of action, the Court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment with regard to Plaintiff's retaliation claim in its entirety; grants the motion with regard to Plaintiff's disability discrimination and failure to accommodate claims insofar as those claims relate to conduct that occurred prior to January 1, 2009; and denies the motion with respect to Plaintiff's disability discrimination and failure to accommodate claims insofar as those claims relate to conduct that occurred after January 1, 2009.

C. Second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action: NYHRL, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, [*38]  Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Breach of Contract
Defendant contends that the Court should dismiss Plaintiff's second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action because he did not timely serve a notice of claim on Defendant. Plaintiff argues that the Court should permit his state-law claims to go forward despite his failure to comply with the notice-of-claim requirements because an exception exists under New York County Law § 52 where a plaintiff is vindicating a public, rather than private, interest.
"[I]n a federal court, state notice-of-claim statutes apply to state-law claims." Hardy v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosps. Corp., 164 F.3d 789, 793 (2d Cir. 1999) (citations omitted). In this case, Plaintiff has brought four causes of action pursuant to New York State law: (1) a claim under the NYHRL, (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (4) breach of contract.
New York County Law § 52 provides, in pertinent part:
Any claim or notice of claim against a county for damage, injury or death, or for invasion of personal or property rights, of every name and nature, and whether casual or continuing trespass or nuisance and any other claim for damages arising at law or in equity, alleged to have been caused or sustained in whole or in part by or [*39]  because of any misfeasance, omission of duty, negligence or wrongful act on the part of the county, its officers, agents, servants or employees, must be made and served in compliance with section fifty-e of the general municipal law.
N.Y. County Law § 52(1). New York General Municipal Law § 50-e requires service of a notice of claim ("Notice of Claim" or "Notice") within ninety days after the claim arises. See N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law § 50-e(1)(a). Among other things, the Notice must state the nature of the claim and "the time when, the place where and the manner in which the claim arose[.]" N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law § 50-e(2). The Notice need not provide that information with "'literal nicety or exactness'"; rather, the test is whether it provides facts sufficient to enable the defendant to investigate. Phillipps v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 68 A.D.3d 461, 462, 890 N.Y.S.2d 510 (1st Dep't 2009) (quotation omitted).
In this case, Plaintiff failed to provide any Notice of Claim to Defendant. The filing of a timely Notice of Claim is a condition precedent to bringing a state-law claim against a County or other municipality. See, e.g., Brennan v. Albany Cnty., No. 00-CV-01985, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112141, 2005 WL 2437026, *6 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2005) (quotation omitted). Although there is an exception to the Notice requirement where a plaintiff is seeking to vindicate a public, rather than a private, interest, see Mills v. Cnty. of Monroe, 59 N.Y.2d 307, 308-09, 451 N.E.2d 456, 464 N.Y.S.2d 709 (1983), Plaintiff's conclusory allegations that he brought this action to vindicate a public interest do not suffice. [*40]  Indeed, although Plaintiff is seeking an injunction in addition to damages, he is primarily seeking to redress his own alleged injuries. See Wallikas v. Harder, 67 F. Supp. 2d 82, 85-86 (N.D.N.Y. 1999) (citations omitted) (holding that the plaintiffs' state-law claims were brought to enforce private rights, rather than to vindicate a public interest, where they sought monetary damages, reinstatement to their former jobs, and the removal of any admonitions on their personnel records).
Accordingly, the Court dismisses Plaintiff's state-law claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. In addition, the Court dismisses Plaintiff's NYHRL claim because "a cause of action under the Human Rights Law, while not a traditional tort, is subject to the notice of claim requirements of County Law § 52." Brennan, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112141, 2005 WL 2437026, at *6 (citations omitted); Picciano v. Nassau Cnty. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 290 A.D.2d 164, 168-69, 736 N.Y.S.2d 55 (2d Dep't 2001) (holding that the failure to serve a Notice of Claim pursuant to County Law § 52 in an action to recover damages based on the Human Rights Law is fatal unless the action has been brought to vindicate a public interest).
Finally, with regard to Plaintiff's breach-of-contract claim, even though County Law § 52 generally applies to any claim for damages against a county,  [*41] see Fitzgibbons v. City of Oswego, No. 5:10-CV-1038, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143772, 2011 WL 6218208, *3 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 13, 2011) (citations and footnote omitted), breach-of-contract claims are not subject to the notice-of-claim requirements of County Law § 52. See Copece Contr. Corp. v. Cnty. of Erie, 115 A.D.2d 320, 320, 495 N.Y.S.2d 871 (4th Dep't 1985) (citations omitted); Smith v. Rise East School, 120 A.D.2d 726, 726, 502 N.Y.S.2d 780 (2d Dep't 1986) (citations omitted); Byrnes v. Monroe Cnty., 128 Misc. 2d 700, 490 N.Y.S.2d 977, 985 (City Ct. 1985), judgment aff'd by 131 Misc. 2d 129, 499 N.Y.S.2d 350 (Cnty. Ct. Monroe Cnty. 1986), order rev'd on other grounds by 122 A.D.2d 549, 505 N.Y.S.2d 473 (4th Dep't 1986); Meed v. Nassau Cnty. Police Dep't, 70 Misc. 2d 274, 275-76, 332 N.Y.S.2d 679 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Nassau Cnty. 1972); Gahagan Dredging Corp. v. Cnty. of Nassau, 71 Misc. 2d 751, 752, 338 N.Y.S.2d 241 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Nassau Cnty. 1972). The Court, therefore, denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to this claim.
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's second, third, and fourth causes of action and denies it with respect to Plaintiff's fifth cause of action for breach-of-contract.

D. Sixth cause of action: 42 U.S.C. § 1981
To establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, a plaintiff must establish that (1) he is a member of a racial minority; (2) the defendant intended to discriminate against him on the basis of his race; and (3) the discrimination concerned one of the statute's enumerated activities. See Brown v. City of Oneonta, 221 F.3d 329, 339 (2d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).
Here, Plaintiff makes no allegations on the basis of race; rather, Plaintiff, a Caucasian male, alleges that Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. This claim is simply not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 because Plaintiff is not a member of a protected class for purposes of § 1981.17 Accordingly, the Court [*42]  grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's sixth cause of action.

E. Seventh cause of action: 42 U.S.C. § 1983
To prevail on a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must show that a person or entity, acting under color of state law, deprived him of the rights, privileges, or immunities guaranteed by the Constitution or by federal law. See 42 U.S.C. § 1983; McDarby v. Dinkins, 907 F.2d 1334, 1336 (2d Cir. 1990) (citation omitted). Since § 1983 "'is not itself a source of substantive rights,' but merely provides 'a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred' . . . . [t]he first step in [analyzing] any such claim is to identify the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed." Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1994) (internal quotation and other citations omitted). To state an actionable claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant's conduct deprived him of a federal right while acting under color of state law. See Sykes v. James, 13 F.3d 515, 519 (2d Cir. 1993) (citations omitted).
In this case, Plaintiff's amended complaint does not set forth the constitutional or statutory basis upon which he bases his § 1983 claim. Plaintiff alleges the following:
Defendant Kevin Walsh in his capacity as Sheriff of Onondaga County knew or should have known of the conduct of Plaintiff's commanding officers, including Lieutenant Metz, and [*43]  members of the council of chiefs, and discriminated against him by failing or refusing to take effective action to stop the denial of accommodation to, discipline of, and retaliation against Plaintiff in violation of Section 1983.
See Amended Complaint at ¶ 55. Plaintiff's response papers also fail to clearly to identify the alleged Constitutional right or federal statute that Defendant's conduct implicates.
Construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, he appears to allege an Equal Protection claim for disability discrimination because he alleges that (1) he was the only employee required to bring in doctors' notes stating that he was medically capable of working without restrictions, and (2) Defendant failed to accommodate his disability while accommodating the disabilities of other similarly situated employees. See Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment at 11.
Generally, to establish a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiff must allege that he was treated differently than similarly situated employees and that such treatment was based on impermissible characteristics such as race, national origin, or gender. See Hayden v. Cnty. of Nassau, 180 F.3d 42, 48 (2d Cir. 1999) (citation omitted). Plaintiff must, therefore, show [*44]  that Defendant acted with purposeful discrimination toward an identifiable class. See Giano v. Senkowski, 54 F.3d 1050, 1057 (2d Cir. 1995) (citations omitted). In this case, however, Plaintiff has not alleged discrimination against an identifiable class because disability is not a protected class under the Equal Protection Clause. See Kaiser v. Highland Cent. Sch. Dist., No. 1:08-CV-0436, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98936, 2008 WL 5157450, *2 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2008) (citations omitted).
Courts in the Second Circuit are in disagreement regarding whether a public employee may bring an Equal Protection claim for disability discrimination under § 1983. See Negron, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119463, 2011 WL 4737068, at *15 (collecting cases). In Kaiser, as in this case, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated his Equal Protection rights because they discriminated against him based on his disability or perceived disability. See Kaiser, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98936, 2008 WL 5157450, at * 2. The court held:
Disability and/or perceived disability are not suspect or quasi-suspect classifications. . . . Therefore, a plaintiff asserting an Equal Protection claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 based on disability discrimination is asserting a "class of one" Equal Protection claim, to which the courts apply rational basis analysis. . . . However, in Enquist v. Oregon Department of Agriculture, the Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection Clause does not apply to a public employee asserting a violation of the [*45]  Equal Protection Clause under a "class of one" theory. . . .
Id. (internal citations omitted); see also Gallagher v. Town of Fairfield, No. 3:10-cv-1270, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90459, 2011 WL 3563160, *4 (D. Conn. Aug. 15, 2011) (citations omitted) (finding that the plaintiff "does not have a cognizable claim under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment" because disability is not a protected class). But see Graham v. Watertown City Sch. Dist., No. 7:10-CV-756, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38398, 2011 WL 1344149, *4-*5 (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2011) (finding that a public employee plaintiff alleged "a class-based equal protection claim, not a class-of-one claim" because, despite being the only disabled employee, the plaintiff did not claim to be in a class of her own, but rather alleged class-based disability discrimination).
Here, Plaintiff appears to allege that he was "unfairly singled out by Defendant[] in violation of the Equal Protection Clause," Pape v. Bd. of Educ. of Wappingers Cent. Sch. Dist., No. 07-CV-8828, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91738, 2009 WL 3151200, *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2009), because Defendant required him, and only him, to bring in doctors' notes in order to work following absences. See Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 14-15, 55. To bring such a claim, a plaintiff must allege that he "'has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.'" Ruston v. Town Bd. for Town of Skaneateles, 610 F.3d 55, 58 (2d Cir. 2010) (quotation and footnote omitted). To the extent that this vague cause of action constitutes a "class of one" Equal Protection [*46]  claim, the Court finds that this claim fails because such claims are not cognizable in the public employment context. See Enquist v. Oregon Dep't of Agric., 553 U.S. 591, 604-09, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975 (2008); Appel v. Spiridon, 531 F.3d 138, 139 (2d Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted).
Furthermore, to the extent that Plaintiff alleges a failure to accommodate on the basis of his disability or perceived disability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, this too must fail "because the Equal Protection Clause does not require accommodations for the disabled." Negron, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119463, 2011 WL 4737068, at *16 (citation omitted).
Therefore, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's seventh cause of action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because Plaintiff, a public employee, cannot maintain a "class of one" Equal Protection claim.18

IV. CONCLUSION
Accordingly, having reviewed the entire record in this matter, the parties' submissions and the applicable law, and for the above-stated reasons, the Court hereby
ORDERS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED with respect to Plaintiff's second, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action; and the Court further
ORDERS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED with respect to Plaintiff's fifth cause of action; and the Court further
ORDERS that, as to Plaintiff's first and eighth causes of action, Defendant's motion for summary [*47]  judgment is DENIED with regard to Plaintiff's retaliation claim; GRANTED with regard to Plaintiff's disability discrimination and failure to accommodate claims insofar as those claims relate to conduct that occurred prior to January 1, 2009; and DENIED with regard to Plaintiff's disability discrimination and failure to accommodate claims insofar as those claims relate to conduct that occurred after January 1, 2009; and the Court further
ORDERS that Plaintiff's counsel is to initiate a telephone conference, using a professional teleconferencing service, with the Court and opposing counsel on February 29, 2012, at 9:30 a.m. to set a trial date for this matter.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
