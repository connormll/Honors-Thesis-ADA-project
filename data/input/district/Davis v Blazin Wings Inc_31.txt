CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings: Order GRANTING Defendants' Motion to Dismiss WITH LEAVE TO AMEND (Dkt. No. 13-1)
Before the Court is Defendants Blazin Wings, Inc., Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc., Buffalo Wild Wings International, Inc., and Does 1 through 20's (collectively, "Defendants") Motion to Dismiss. ("Motion," Dkt. No. 13-1.) The Court finds Defendants' Motion appropriate for resolution without a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. After considering all papers timely filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the Court GRANTS Defendants' [*2]  Motion and DISMISSES the Complaint WITH LEAVE TO AMEND, and VACATES the December 5, 2016 hearing set for this matter.

I. BACKGROUND
On August 19, 2016, Brian Davis, ("Plaintiff") filed his Complaint in Riverside Superior Court on August 19, 2016. (Dkt. No. 1-2.) Defendants removed the action to this Court on October 13, 2016. (Dkt. No. 1.) Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) on October 20, 2016. (Dkt. No. 13.) In support of the Motion, Defendants attached a Declaration of Christina H. Hayes and a Proposed Order. (Dkt. Nos. 13-2 & 13-3.) Plaintiff filed his Opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss on November 14, 2016. (Dkt. No. 15.) Defendants filed their Reply to Plaintiff's Opposition on November 21, 2016. (Dkt. No. 16.)

II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AND CLAIMS
Plaintiff brings the following seventeen causes of action: (1) discrimination in violation of FEHA (Dkt. No. 1-2, 5); (2) failure to prevent discrimination in violation of FEHA (Id. at 5-6); (3) failure to engage in a timely good faith interactive process in violation of FEHA (Id. at 6); (4) failure to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of FEHA (Id. at 7); (5) harassment in violation of FEHA (Id. at 7-8); (6) failure [*3]  to prevent harassment in violation of FEHA (Id. at 8); (7) retaliation in violation of FEHA (Id. at 9); (8) violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA") (Id.); (9) failure to pay meal and rest period compensation in violation of California Labor Code Sections 226.7, 512, 1194, 1194.2, 1197, and 1198 (Id. at 10); (10) failure to pay minimum wage and agreed upon wages for all hours worked in violation of California Labor Code Sections 1194, 1197, 1197.2, 1198, 221, 222, and 223 (Id.); (11) failure to pay timely earned wages in violation of California Labor Code Section 204 (Id. at 11); (12) failure to provide itemized wage statements in violation of California Labor Code Section 226 (Id.); (13) failure to indemnify for necessary expenditures in violation of California Labor Code Section 2802 (Id. at 12); (14) an individual and representative claim via California Labor Code Sections 2699, et seq. for unlawful labor practices in violation of California Labor Code Sections 98.6, 204, 221, 222, 223, 226, 226.7, 510, 1102.5, 1194, 1194.2, 1197, 1198, and 2802 (Id. at 13); (15) unfair competition claim under California Business and Professions Code Sections 17200, et seq. (Id.); (16) retaliation claim in violation of California Labor Code Section 1102.5 (Id. at 14); and (17) wrongful termination and/or constructive discharge in violation of public policy claim as embodied by FEHA, CFRA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), Labor Code Section 1102.5, and Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 27 Cal. 3d 167, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330 (1980). (Id.)
Plaintiff seeks payment of earned wages, withheld earnings, other damages according to proof ascertained at trial, statutory penalties, special damages, [*4]  compensatory and general damages, punitive damages allowed by law, loss of income, reasonable attorney's fees, costs, interest, restitution, and other equitable relief. (Id. at 15.)
In support of Plaintiff's FEHA claims (counts 1 through 7), he alleges that "Defendants discriminated/harassed/retaliated" against him "on the bases of his age; actual/perceived medical condition/disabilitiy; engagement in protected activity; request for and exercise of medical leave; request for and engagement in the interactive process and reasonable accommodation; in retaliation for Plaintiffs [sic] opposition to and complaints about harassment/discrimination/retaliation in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") and California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"); in retaliation for Plaintiff's opposition to and complaints about the Labor Code violations referenced in this complaint." (Dkt. No. 1-2, 3.) Further, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to prevent the aforementioned discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation by failing to "engage in the interactive process," "provide reasonable accommodation for Claimant's disability/medical condition," by "subjecting Plaintiff to a hostile work environment [*5]  involving verbal conduct disparaging Plaintiff's actual/perceived medical condition/disability, increased scrutiny, false/pretextual write-ups, harassment, refusing to let him work, suspension, and termination/constructive discharge." (Id. at 4.) Plaintiff maintains that these actions constitute "disparate impact and disparate treatment discrimination, and are part of a pattern and practice of discrimination/retaliation." (Id.)
As to Plaintiff's causes of action under the California Labor Code, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to: (a) provide ten-minute rest periods for every four hours he worked and thirty-minute meal periods for each five hours he worked; (b) pay Plaintiff labor code premiums for the required rest and meal periods it failed to provide; (c) pay Plaintiff his agreed upon wage or the minimum wage for all hours Plaintiff worked; (d) pay Plaintiff his wages due twice each calendar month "because they failed to include wages for her [sic] hours worked, and meal/rest period premiums"; (e) indemnify Plaintiff for business expenditures; and (f) provide Plaintiff with accurate wage statements. (Id.)
As to harm for the aforementioned unlawful conduct, Plaintiff alleges that "[a]s [*6]  a proximate result of the wrongful conduct of Defendants, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer a loss in earnings and other employment benefits according to proof at time of trial." (Id.) For each of the seventeen causes of action, Plaintiff "re-alleges and incorporates by reference all paragraphs of this Complaint as though full set forth herein." (Id. at 5-14.)

III. DISCUSSION

A. Defendants' Motion
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims must be dismissed for failure to state a claim as the Complaint "is wholly conclusory and completely devoid of any factual allegations showing that Plaintiff's right to relief is anything more than speculative." (Dkt. No. 13-1, 6.) In this vein, Defendants assert that the Complaint fails to plead "specific facts, circumstances, acts or practices that, if true, would establish that Defendants violated the law and are liable to Plaintiff or any purported aggrieved employee." (Id.) Specifically, Defendants take issue with the lack of factual bases setting forth "the basic terms of Plaintiff's employment—including the identity of his employer, the location where he was employed, his job title, and the dates of his employment. . ." (Id.)
With respect to Plaintiff's [*7]  FEHA claims, Defendants argue that the Complaint is devoid of any allegations that may "identify his purported disability and/or medical condition," "his age for purposes of any age discrimination claim," "fails to identify if and when he became disabled," "fails to identify if and when he requested a reasonable accommodation and to whom," "fails to identify any efforts he made to engage in the interactive process and any response by Defendants, "fails to allege that he could perform the essential functions of his position," "fails to provide any factual information regarding who allegedly subjected him to a hostile work environment and/or discriminated against him and in what way," "fails to describe the nature of any of the alleged protected activity and fails to identify to whom he complained, [] the nature of the complaints, and when the complaints were made," and "provides absolutely no detail regarding any harm he allegedly suffered, including the dates or circumstances surrounding any supposed suspension, termination or constructive/discharge [sic]." (Dkt. No. 13-1, 11.) Defendants further point out that the Complaint is lacking any information that may show that Plaintiff was [*8]  ever actually suspended, "whether he has requested and/or been granted any leaves of absence, and whether his employment has, in fact, been terminated." (Id.)

B. Legal Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows a party to bring a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Rule 12(b)(6) is read in conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2); Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957) (holding that the Federal Rules require that a plaintiff provide "'a short and plain statement of the claim' that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests") (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). When evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must accept all material allegations in the complaint—as well as any reasonable inferences to be drawn from them—as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Doe v. United States, 419 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir. 2005); ARC Ecology v. U.S. Dep't of Air Force, 411 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir. 2005); Moyo v. Gomez, 32 F.3d 1382, 1384 (9th Cir. 1994).
"While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitlement to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations [*9]  omitted). Rather, the allegations in the complaint "must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Id.
Surviving a motion to dismiss requires a plaintiff to allege "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570; Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 697, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are 'merely consistent with' a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of 'entitlement to relief.'" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The Ninth Circuit has clarified that (1) a complaint must "contain sufficient allegations of underlying facts to give fair notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself effectively," and (2) "the factual allegations that are taken as true must plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief, such that it is not unfair to require the opposing party to be subjected to the expense of discovery and continued litigation." Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011).
Although the scope of review on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is limited to the contents of the complaint, the Court may consider certain materials, such as documents [*10]  attached to the complaint, documents incorporated by reference in the complaint, or matters of judicial notice. United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 907-08 (9th Cir. 2003). Under the incorporation by reference doctrine, the Court may consider documents not attached to the pleading if: (1) those documents are referenced extensively in the complaint or form the basis of the plaintiff's claim; and (2) if no party questions their authenticity. Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005).

C. Sufficiency of Allegations

1. Fair Employment and Housing Claims
California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA," Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq.) prohibits discrimination on several grounds including bias based on an employee's "physical disability, mental disability [and] medical condition. . ." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). FEHA is California's analog for the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA," 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.). Both FEHA and the ADA require employers to provide "reasonable accommodations" to employees who, because of their disability or medical condition, are unable to perform the "essential functions" of their job. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). To facilitate the provision of reasonable accommodations, FEHA imposes a related continuing duty on employers to "engage in the interactive process" with the employee once the employer has been put on notice of the need for an accommodation. [*11]  Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n).
Failure to engage in the interactive process is a standalone cause of action under the FEHA. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n); Swanson v. Morongo Valley Unified School Dist., 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 971, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014). Since the duty to provide reasonable accommodations is predicated on the employer's ongoing duty to engage in the interactive process, most failure to accommodate claims include claims for failure to engage in the interactive process.
Additionally, employers must "take all reasonable steps to prevent ... harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). This provision is not an independent basis for liability under FEHA; it is only a basis for liability where actual harassment occurred. Kohler v. Inter-Tel Techs., 244 F.3d 1167, 1174 (9th Cir.2001) (citing Trujillo v. N. County Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 287-89, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998)). To satisfy the obligation to prevent harassment or discrimination from occurring, employers must dissuade employees from engaging in unlawful conduct. Ellison v. Brady, 924 F.2d 872, 882 (9th Cir.1991). The reasonableness of an employer's actions turn on its ability to stop the harassment. Id.

a. General Pleading Requirements
To pursue claims for FEHA violations, a plaintiff must first exhaust administrative remedies. Rodriguez v. Airborne Express, 265 F.3d 890, 896 (9th Cir. 2001). FEHA imposes a duty upon plaintiffs to file a written charge of discrimination with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") within one year of the alleged violation and to obtain notice of the right to sue from the Department. [*12]  Id.; Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(d). Upon receiving a right to sue letter, a plaintiff has one year to file his or her FEHA claim in a judicial forum. Cal. Gov't Code § 12965(b). The plaintiff bears the "burden to plead and prove timely exhaustion of administrative remedies, such as filing a sufficient complaint with [DFEH] and obtaining a right-to-sue-letter" prior to filing a claim under FEHA in court. Kim v. Konad USA Distribution, Inc., 226 Cal. App. 4th 1336, 1345, 172 Cal. Rptr. 3d 686 (2014) (citing Garcia v. Los Banos Unified School Dist., 418 F. Supp. 2d 1194, 1215 (E.D. Cal. 2006)).
Courts have found sufficient complaints alleging that a plaintiff exhausted his or her remedies by timely filing charges of discrimination with and receiving right-to-sue letters from the DFEH, without the need to allege that the plaintiff named the individual defendant. Wells v. Regents of the Univ. of California, No. 15-CV-01700-SI, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150595, 2015 WL 6746820, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 2015) (citing Peterson v. State of California Dep't of Corr. & Rehab., 451 F. Supp. 2d 1092, 1112 (E.D. Cal. 2006) (denying motion to dismiss although plaintiff did not allege that he named the individual defendants whom he was suing in the administrative charge)).
As to exhaustion, Plaintiff states that he sent letters via Certified Mail to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and to Defendants and more than 33 days have elapsed without Plaintiff receiving any notice from the Labor and Workforce Development Agency stating its intention to prosecute Plaintiff's PAGA claims. (Id. at 4-5.) Additionally, Plaintiff [*13]  states in his Complaint that he "received a Right to Sue letter from the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment" and has therefore exhausted all necessary administrative remedies. (Dkt. No. 1-2, 5.)

i. Discrimination & Failure to Prevent Discrimination
To state a prima facie claim for discrimination under FEHA, the plaintiff must demonstrate "(1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggest[ing] discriminatory motive." Tumblin v. USA Waste of California, Inc., No. CV162902DSFPLAX, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94816, 2016 WL 3922044, at *7 (C.D. Cal. July 20, 2016)(internal citations omitted)(internal quotation marks omitted).

1. Age
Section 12941, the specific FEHA provision addressing age discrimination in employment, makes it "an unlawful employment practice for an employer to ... discharge, dismiss, reduce, suspend, or demote, any individual over the age of 40 on the ground of age...." Esberg v. Union Oil Co., 28 Cal. 4th 262, 267, 121 Cal. Rptr. 2d 203, 47 P.3d 1069 (2002). Where the alleged adverse employment action is an employee's termination, the employee must establish that he was "replaced by a substantially [*14]  younger employee with equal or inferior qualifications." Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Co., 113 F.3d 912, 917 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 891 (9th Cir. 1994), as amended on denial of reh'g (July 14, 1994)).
Plaintiff has not provided sufficient allegations to support an inference that he is a member of a protected class as he has not alleged that he is over the age of 40. Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged Defendants terminated his employment because of his age as he has not alleged facts to suggest that he was replaced by a substantially younger employee with equal or inferior qualifications. Nor has Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to suggest that the adverse employment actions he lists in his Complaint—"increased scrutiny, false/pretextual write-ups, [], refusing to let him work, suspension. . ."—were taken by Defendants because of his age. cf. Tumblin v. USA Waste of California, Inc., No. CV162902DSFPLAX, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94816, 2016 WL 3922044, at *8 (C.D. Cal. July 20, 2016) (dismissing age discrimination claims under FEHA because while Plaintiff alleged that he "was . . . written up when other younger employees would not be written up, [] . . . this does not constitute an adverse employment action.").
As such, Plaintiff's age discrimination claims under Count One are DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND for failure to plead sufficient facts [*15]  to state a claim.

2. Disability
To state a claim for discrimination on the basis of disability under FEHA, Plaintiff must establish that (1) he is a disabled person within the meaning of the Act; (2) he is qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of the job which he holds or seeks; and (3) he has suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Wood v. Cty. of Alameda, No. C 94 1557 TEH, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17514, 1995 WL 705139, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 17, 1995).
A qualified individual with a disability means "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).1 The Act specifies a number of actions that constitute discrimination, including "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee ..." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
Plaintiff fails to allege any facts specifying his alleged disability, that he is a qualified individual or how Defendant failed to accommodate his disability. Accordingly, there is no way for the Court to conclude that Plaintiff's entitlement to relief under FEHA for the alleged harm resulting from Defendants' discriminatory employment actions is more than speculative. Similarly, Plaintiff's failure to prevent discrimination claim under Count Two is deficiently plead as stating a claim for failure to prevent discrimination relies on adequately alleging a claim for discrimination. Accordingly, Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim under Count One, and his failure to prevent discrimination claim under Count Two are both DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

ii. Harassment & Failure to Prevent Harassment
To state a claim of harassment, Plaintiff must allege "(1) he was a member of a protected class; (2) [*17]  he was subjected to unwelcome ... harassment; (3) the harassment was based on [age/disability/mental condition]; (4) the harassment unreasonably interfered with his work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (5) [the defendants are] liable for the harassment." Thompson v. City of Monrovia, 186 Cal. App. 4th 860, 876, 112 Cal. Rptr. 3d 377 (2010). Under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), "harassment in the workplace consists of discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Cofer v. Parker-Hannifin Corp., No. SACV1600596CJCAFMX, 194 F. Supp. 3d 1014, 2016 WL 3660845 (C.D. Cal. July 8, 2016). Occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial harassment is insufficient to allege the harassment created a hostile work environment: Plaintiff must establish a repeated pattern of harassment. Thompson, 186 Cal. App. 4th 860, 112 Cal. Rptr. 3d 377.
Since Plaintiff has failed to provide any specific instances of harassment, the Court cannot determine whether the alleged harassment based on Plaintiff's age or disability arose to a repeated pattern sufficient to create a hostile work environment. Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot state a claim for harassment under the FEHA, which also precludes him from [*18]  adequately alleging Defendants' failed to prevent the harassment he claims he experienced. Accordingly, Plaintiff's harassment and failure to prevent harassment claims under Counts Five and Six are DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

iii. Retaliation
To assert a prima facie retaliation claim under FEHA, "the plaintiff must show that he engaged in a protected activity, his employer subjected him to adverse employment action, and there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." Strother v. S. California Permanente Med. Grp., 79 F.3d 859, 868 (9th Cir. 1996), as amended on denial of reh'g (Apr. 22, 1996), as amended on denial of reh'g (June 3, 1996). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants retaliated against him for his opposition to and complaints about the alleged harassment, discrimination, and retaliation in violation of FEHA and the CFRA, and his complaints regarding Defendants' alleged Labor Code violations. (Dkt. No. 1-2, 3.)
The specific, objectionable practices allegedly communicated by Plaintiff to Defendants are not clearly specified and do not provide Defendants with fair notice of the factual basis therefor. For Plaintiff to adequately state a claim for retaliation, Plaintiff must allege facts that specify the nature of the complaint [*19]  or complaints made to Defendants, the adverse employment action resulting from making such complaint, and facts from which it may be plausibly inferred that the adverse employment action is linked to those complaints. The Complaint does not contain any specific facts describing Plaintiff's employment status, his job duties, when or where he worked for Defendants, the circumstances surrounding his alleged termination, the persons to whom he complained about the allegedly hostile work environment, the persons he notified when he became disabled, what prompted him to take medical leave, the specific adverse employment actions taken in response, and many other factual predicates required for the Court to determine whether a claim has been adequately alleged. Given the absence of such allegations, Plaintiff's cause of action for retaliation is DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

iv. Failure to Engage in Timely Good Faith Interactive Process and Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations
Section 12940, subdivision (m) provides that it is an unlawful employment practice "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant [*20]  or employee." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940. Two principles underlie a cause of action for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. First, the employee must request an accommodation. Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1114-15 (9th Cir. 2000), revd. on other grounds, U.S. Airways v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002). Second, the parties must engage in an interactive process regarding the requested accommodation and, if the process fails, responsibility for the failure rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 54, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006).
Section 12940, subdivision (m) requires an employer to accommodate only a "known physical ... disability." Cal.Code Regs., tit. 2, § 7293.9. As such, the employee bears the burden of giving the employer notice of his or her disability. Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1222, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899 (2006). Although no particular form of request is required, Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 954, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997), "[t]he duty of an employer reasonably to accommodate an employee's handicap does not arise until the employer is aware of [employee's] disability and physical limitations." Id. at 949-950 (internal quotation marks omitted).2
Once the employer has notice of the disability, both the employer and employee must cooperate in good faith to identify reasonable accommodations. 2 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2 § 11069(c) & (d). The employee must "cooperate in good faith" and provide "reasonable medical documentation" identifying the existence of the disability and the related work restrictions, if requested. 2 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2 § 11069(d) [*21] .
An employer's duty to engage in the interactive process ends once a reasonable accommodation is provided. 2 Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 2 § 11069(c)(8). Still, since the employer's duty to engage in the interactive process is ongoing, this duty continues "where the employer is aware that the initial accommodation is failing and further accommodation is needed." Humphrey v. Memorial Hospitals Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1138 (9th Cir. 2001). The employee, however, must notify the employer of the need for a different accommodation. Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1384-85, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000).
A claim for failure to accommodate is governed by California Government Code § 12940(m). The essential elements of such a claim are: (1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability. Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 255-56, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). A claim under § 12940(m) is similar to one for discrimination under § 12940(a) in that the plaintiff must suffer from a disability covered by FEHA and is a qualified individual, but differs in that an adverse employment action need not be shown. Id.
Here, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts specifying Davis's alleged disability, that he is a qualified individual, the essential elements of his job or the essential elements of an alternative job, or how Defendants failed to accommodate his disability. While Plaintiff's pleading [*22]  burden at this stage is light, he must provide at least some minimal factual basis to support the conclusion that he can perform the essential functions of the job with or without accommodation for the Court to determine whether his entitlement to relief is plausible. Kelley v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 750 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1139 (E.D. Cal. 2010). Since Plaintiff gives no information at all as to his actual job position, his job duties, how he is disabled or medically incapacitated, what he is capable or incapable of doing, or the reasonable accommodations he seeks, Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim is DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

2. California Family Rights Act Claim
The California Family Rights Act ("CFRA") is intended to protect employee's from suffering adverse employment consequences when they must take leave from work for certain personal or family medical reasons. Nelson v. United Technologies, 74 Cal. App. 4th 597, 606, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 239 (1999). To protect job security in circumstances where an employee must tend to personal or familial health issues, the CFRA makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer of 50 or more persons to refuse to grant an employee's request to take up to 12 "workweeks" in any 12-month period for family care and medical leave. § 12945.2, subds. (a), (c)(2)(A); see generally, Lonicki v. Sutter Health Central, 43 Cal.4th 201, 208-209, 74 Cal. Rptr. 3d 570, 180 P.3d 321 (2008). CFRA also prohibits an employer "to refuse [*23]  to hire, or to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, or discriminate against, any individual because of" his or her "exercise of the right to family care and medical leave provided by subdivision (a)." § 12945.2, subd. (l )(1); see also Cal.Code Regs., tit. 2, § 7297.7, subd. (a). This anti-discrimination provision prevents employers from counting CFRA leave as absences under a no-fault attendance policy. Cal.Code Regs., tit. 2, § 7297.10, incorporating by reference, inter alia, 29 C.F.R. § 825.220, subd. (d).
The CFRA also protects employees from adverse employment actions taken when the employee takes leave for his own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position. § 12945.2, subd. (c)(3)(C). A "serious health condition" is defined as "an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either of the following: (a) Inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential health care facility; (b) Continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider." § 12945.2, subd. (c)(8); Cal.Code Regs., tit. 2, § 7297.0, subd. (o). "[F]or an employee to be entitled to a medical leave for her own serious health condition, the condition must cause her to be unable to work at all or unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of her position." Neisendorf v. Levi Strauss & Co., 143 Cal. App. 4th 509, 517, 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 216 (2006).
To make out a prima facie case for a violation of the CFRA, [*24]  Plaintiff must allege the following elements: "(1) the defendant was an employer covered by CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination ..., because of her exercise of her right to CFRA leave." Dudley v. Department of Transportation, 90 Cal. App. 4th 255, 261, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 739 (2001).
There are no allegations in the Complaint that may allow the Court to determine whether Defendants are employers covered by the CFRA, whether Plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave, whether Plaintiff actually exercised the right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose, or whether or not an adverse employment action was taken as a result of Plaintiff's exercise of his right to CFRA leave. At this point, Plaintiff's entitlement to relief under the CFRA is purely speculative. Thus, Plaintiff's CFRA claims are DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

3. Labor Code Violations
Absent from the Complaint are any allegations that may provide a factual basis upon which the Court may reasonably infer that Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff the minimum wage, failed to provide wages earned, failed to provide rest [*25]  and meal breaks, failed to indemnify for business expenses, and failed to provide accurate wage statements. It is not even clear from the Complaint that Plaintiff actually worked for any one of the Defendants, when Plaintiff worked, Plaintiff's job duties, the conditions of employment, or the amount of pay or indemnification to which Plaintiff could be entitled under the terms of the employment relationship. Completely missing from the Complaint are any facts that even establish an employment relationship for purposes of Plaintiff's claims under the Labor Code.
The pleading standard set by Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure "does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Kelley v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 750 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1137 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)). Since all that Plaintiff has alleged here is that Defendants violated myriad provisions of the Labor Code, the Complaint does not provide any factual bases that may serve as grounds for his entitlement to relief. Further, there are no underlying facts alleged in the Complaint that may give Defendants fair notice of their wrongdoing to enable them to defend themselves effectively. Indeed, there are no factual allegations for the Court to take as true for [*26]  purposes of ruling on this Motion. As such, Plaintiff's California Labor Code claims—counts nine through counts fourteen and count sixteen—are DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. In like manner, Plaintiff's PAGA claim under Count Fourteen—as derivative of and dependent on Plaintiff's deficiently plead Labor Code causes of action—are also DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

4. Unfair Competition Law
California's Unfair Competition Law (the "UCL"), which makes actionable any "unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice." Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. With respect to the unlawful prong, the UCL incorporates other laws and treats violations of those laws as unlawful business practices independently actionable under state law. Chabner v. United Omaha Life Ins. Co., 225 F.3d 1042, 1048 (9th Cir. 2000). "To have standing under California's UCL, as amended by California's Proposition 64, plaintiffs must establish that they (1) suffered an injury in fact and (2) lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition." Birdsong v. Apple, Inc., 590 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir. 2009). "To satisfy the narrower standing requirements imposed by Proposition 64, a party must now (1) establish a loss or deprivation of money or property sufficient to qualify as injury in fact, i.e., economic injury, and (2) show that the economic injury was the result of, [*27]  i.e., caused by, the unfair business practice...that is the gravamen of the claim." Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court, 51 Cal.4th 310, 322, 120 Cal. Rptr. 3d 741, 246 P.3d 877 (2011). California courts have since interpreted the Herr decision to stand for the principle that Section 17200 protects employees as well as consumers and competitors. Alch v. Superior Court, 122 Cal. App. 4th 339, 402, 19 Cal. Rptr. 3d 29 (2004).
Plaintiff predicates his UCL claim on Defendants' alleged labor code violations. (Dkt. No. 1-2, 13.) Plaintiff also alleges that he "has been prejudiced, and "has lost property," "[a]s a direct and proximate result of the unfair business practices of Defendant." (Id.) Because Plaintiff has not adequately pled any violation of any of the laws that Plaintiff claims create a basis for unfair business practice liability under Section 17200, Plaintiff's fifteenth cause of action is DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

5. Wrongful Termination/Constructive Discharge in Violation of Public Policy
An action for wrongful demotion in violation of public policy will lie where (1) plaintiff was employed by defendant, (2) defendant demoted plaintiff, (3) the alleged violation of public policy was a motivating reason for plaintiff's demotion, and (4) the demotion caused plaintiff harm. See Haney v. Aramark Uniform Services, Inc., 121 Cal.App.4th 623, 641, 17 Cal. Rptr. 3d 336 (2004).
Because Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for (a) age, disability, or medical condition discrimination, [*28]  harassment, failure to accommodate, or failure to engage in the interactive process under the FEHA, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or ADA, (b) has failed to state a claim under the CFRA or the Family and Medical Leave Act, and (c) has failed to state a claim for retaliation in violation of California Labor Code Section 1102.5, Plaintiff cannot state a derivative claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Sanders v. Arneson Products, Inc., 91 F.3d 1351, 1354 (9th Cir. 1996); Sneddon v. ABF Freight Sys., 489 F. Supp. 2d 1124, 1131 (S.D. Cal. 2007) ("[I]f the claim for age discrimination fails, plaintiff's cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy fails because it is derivative of plaintiff's statutory claim under Government Code § 12940."). Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination or constructive discharge in violation of public policy under Count Seventeen is DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Dismiss in its entirety (Dkt. No. 13-1) and DISMISSES the Complaint WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint, if any, by December 19, 2016.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
