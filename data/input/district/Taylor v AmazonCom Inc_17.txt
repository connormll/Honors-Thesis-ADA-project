Opinion



ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Aaliyah Taylor brings this action against her former employer, Defendant Amazon.com, Inc., asserting a claim of hostile work environment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. (Title VII) and claims of discrimination and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. (ADA). (Doc. 13 at ¶¶ 29-45). Defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 58), which Plaintiff opposes, (Doc. 65). Defendant filed a reply in support of its motion. (Doc. 66). For the reasons set forth below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 58), be GRANTED.
As an initial matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff [*2]  has filed a motion for leave to file under seal Doc. 65-3, attached to her response to the motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 69). Although Plaintiff did not attach a memorandum of law supporting her motion for leave to file under seal, (see Doc. 69), the Court agrees based on its own review that Doc. 65-3 contains confidential personal information that warrants sealing. The Court therefore GRANTS Defendant's motion for leave to file matters under seal, (Doc. 69), and the Clerk is DIRECTED to SEAL Doc. 65-3. The Clerk is DIRECTED to UNSEAL Docs. 65, 65-1, and 65-2.

I. FACTS

A. Standards for Presenting Facts at Summary Judgment
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts from Defendant's "Statement of Undisputed Material Facts," (Doc. 58-2), and Plaintiff's "Opposition to the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment," (Doc. 65-1), which is Plaintiff's response to Defendant's statement of undisputed material facts. Additionally, where indicated and as needed, the Court also draws some facts directly from the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.").
For those facts submitted by Defendant that [*3]  are supported by citations to record evidence, and that Plaintiff has not specifically disputed and refuted with citations to admissible record evidence showing a genuine dispute of fact, the Court deems those facts admitted, under Local Rule 56.1(B). See LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGa. ("This Court will deem each of the movant's facts as admitted unless the respondent: (i) directly refutes the movant's fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (ii) states a valid objection to the admissibility of the movant's fact; or (iii) points out that the movant's citation does not support the movant's fact or that the movant's fact is not material or otherwise has failed to comply with the provisions set out in LR 56.1(B)(1)."). The Court has excluded assertions of fact that are immaterial or presented as arguments or legal conclusions, as well as those assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record or set forth only in Defendant's brief and not in the statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B)(1), NDGa. ("The Court will not consider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence . . . (c) stated as an issue or legal conclusion; or (d) set out only in the brief and not [*4]  in the movant's [or respondent's] statement of undisputed facts.").
The Court has also excluded the facts that Plaintiff sets forth only in her brief. Critically, when it comes to the presentation and organization of the facts, Plaintiff did not abide by the Local Rules, which require the respondent to a motion for summary judgment to provide a "statement of additional facts which the respondent contends are material and present a genuine issue for trial. Such separate statement of material facts must meet the requirements set out in LR 56.1(B)(1)." LR 56.1(B)(2)(b). This second filing is what gives the non-moving party the opportunity to inform the Court of those facts that she contends are in dispute—and when she does so, the moving party (here, Defendant) must then file a response to each of the non-movant's facts. LR 56.1(B)(3). Plaintiff did not file her own statement of material facts that she contends are in dispute.
Although Plaintiff does include various facts in her brief in opposition to Defendant's motion for summary judgment, "this . . . is not a substitute for a response [a]nd the inclusion of the facts within the brief does not comply with [Local Rule] 56.1(B)(1) & (2)." Thornton v. Jackson, 998 F. Supp. 2d 1365, 1368 (N.D. Ga. 2014). Other judges on this Court have recognized time and again that [*5]  the Court cannot consider "'any fact set forth only in a brief and not in a response to the movant's statement of facts or in the respondent's own statement of additional material facts.'" Lewis v. Residential Mortg. Sols., No. 1:17-CV-1422-ELR-WEJ, 2018 WL 5276221, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 31, 2018) (collecting cases) (quoting Wills v. Polk Cnty., No. 4:16-CV-47-HLM, 2017 WL 9439105, at *5 n.4 (N.D. Ga. May 2, 2017)), adopted by 2018 WL 5276190 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 16, 2018), aff'd by 800 F. App'x 830 (11th Cir. 2020); see also Ghertner v. Corp. Env'ts of Ga., Inc., No. 1:19-cv-2295-SDG-RGV, 2020 WL 4551269, at *2-3 (N.D. Ga. June 26, 2020) (noting that facts from an affidavit set forth only in the party's brief and not incorporated into a statement of additional facts were not properly before the court), adopted by 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143180, 2020 WL 4577709 (N.D. Ga. July 31, 2020); Rossi v. Fulton Cnty., No. 1:10-CV-4254-RWS-AJB, 2013 WL 1213168, at *17 n.13 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 4, 2013) (noting that Local Rules 56.1(B)(1) and (B)(2) require "that both the movant and opposing party must properly set forth evidence in statements of material fact and that the court will not consider any fact set out only in the brief and not in the statement of undisputed facts" (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)), adopted by 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40889, 2013 WL 1213139 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 22, 2013); Richardson v. Jackson, 545 F. Supp. 2d 1318, 1326 (N.D. Ga. 2008) ("[T]o the extent that either party includes any fact in a brief that is not included in the party's Statement of Material Facts (or in its response to the opposing party's Statement of Material Facts), the Court is not permitted to consider such fact in resolving any pending motion for summary judgment." (emphasis in original)).
This requirement—that a party responding to summary judgment include her facts either in a response to the moving party's [*6]  statement of material facts or in her own statement of facts, and not in her brief—makes sense, and enforcing it is not a "form over substance" exercise. Local Rule 56.1 provides an orderly way for the parties to present and respond to the facts. Specifically, it "protects judicial resources by making the parties organize the evidence rather than leaving the burden upon the district judge," and it "streamlines the resolution of summary judgment motions by focusing the district court's attention on what is, and what is not, genuinely controverted." Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1268 (11th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Indeed, both parties and the Court have a right to rely on the organization that the Local Rule provides. As such, the facts below come from Defendant's statement of material facts and, when necessary, directly from the record evidence.
That being said, the Court has viewed all of the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as it is required to do on a defendant's motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993). Plaintiff disputes some of Defendant's proffered facts, but many of those objections are not supported by citations to evidence or are over matters that are not necessarily [*7]  material to the disposition of this case. The Court will discuss any objections as to Defendant's proffered facts only when necessary to do so regarding a genuine dispute of a material issue of fact.

B. Material Facts

Plaintiff's Employment
Defendant hired Plaintiff as a Retail Experience Manager (REM) in June of 2016, and promoted her to a Level 5 REM within a year. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 4). As an L5 REM, Plaintiff was responsible for managing Amazon Pop-Up stores (kiosks) located at four malls in the Atlanta area. Id. at ¶ 5. Plaintiff was accountable for, and expected to be physically present at, each of the Pop-Up stores she managed. Id. at ¶ 6.1 L5 REMs, including Plaintiff, were advised that "'[m]anagers work a minimum of one opening, one closing[,] and one weekend shift per week. All of your work can be done in stores[,] and we want you to be connected to stores['] teams, driving engagement and associate performance.'" Id. at ¶ 7 (quoting Doc. 59-1 at 352).2 Typically, each of Plaintiff's Pop-Up stores had an Assistant REM reporting directly to her, as well as four or five retail sales associates in Plaintiff's reporting chain. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 8). As part of her role as an L5 REM, Plaintiff [*8]  was expected, among other responsibilities, to "lead[] larger team meetings to create a collegial team environment, communicate updates and . . . reinforce operational and team goals" and to "provide[] structure, direction and a sense of order in the store." Id. at ¶ 9 (quoting Doc. 59-1 at 359-60). During Plaintiff's employment, including prior to her workplace injury, Plaintiff had one-on-one coaching conversations with her supervisors regarding her people leadership skills, gaining trust of colleagues, and communication skills. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 10).3 Plaintiff maintained a good relationship with the employees she supervised and with her supervisors throughout her employment. Id. at ¶ 12.

Plaintiff's Work-Related Injury and Accommodations
On October 22, 2018, Plaintiff reported that she had suffered a work-related injury to her neck, shoulders, and back. (See Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 13; Doc. 59-1 at 387). Plaintiff received workers' compensation and was given access to a panel of doctors for treatment. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 14). After meeting with her primary-care physician, Plaintiff met with three additional doctors. Id. at ¶ 15; (see also Doc. 59-1 at 65:4-24). The three additional doctors [*9]  all opined that Plaintiff could return to work with limited restrictions pertaining to lifting, bending, twisting, and ladder climbing. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 17; see also Doc. 59-1 at 404, 406, 413). After reviewing Dr. Efobi's proposed accommodation (recommending that Plaintiff have physical therapy three times per week for two weeks, avoid prolonged bending or twisting, and perform no lifting over the shoulder greater than twenty pounds with either arm), Defendant accommodated Plaintiff. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 18).
On November 2, 2018, Plaintiff informed Regional Accommodations Manager Karin Turner that she was still in pain and that she would like an accommodation to work from home. Id. at ¶ 19. Defendant did not grant Plaintiff's request to work from home because her role as an L5 REM required her to be physically present. Id. at ¶ 20.4 On November 7, 2018, Plaintiff met with Dr. Petro, who opined that Plaintiff could return to work subject to limited physical restrictions and continued physical therapy. Id. at ¶ 21. On December 7, 2018, Plaintiff met with Dr. Albert who opined that she could return to work with restrictions. Id. at ¶ 23. Plaintiff was on leave related to her work injury from [*10]  approximately November 7, 2018, through early January of 2019. Id. at ¶ 16.
On January 14, 2019, Defendant notified Plaintiff that it had approved the following accommodations: no lifting more than 10 pounds, use of an elevated workspace when using the computer, and purchase of a rolling backpack, laptop riser, portable keyboard, and mouse. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 24). After Plaintiff returned from leave, Deidra Suber, her direct supervisor, met with her on January 19, 2019, to provide feedback that she had received from Plaintiff's team before Plaintiff's injury. Id. at ¶ 25. Ms. Suber informed Plaintiff that her team did not view her as their leader, did not feel supported, and reported that they did not see Plaintiff on a regular basis. Id. at ¶ 26; (see also Doc. 59-1 at 412).

Defendant's Announcement of Store Closures and Plaintiff's Termination
In late 2018, Defendant decided to close certain Pop-Up stores, including Plaintiff's locations, and eliminate the positions affiliated with those stores. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 27). On February 27, 2019, Defendant notified Plaintiff of the store closures and eliminated positions during an Amazon leadership call with senior leaders and managers. Id. at [*11]  ¶ 28. Plaintiff and all other managers were advised that the way in which the store closures were communicated to associates was important because it might serve as shocking news for some employees. Id. at ¶ 29. Plaintiff and the other managers were advised that their associates would be notified of the closures the following day and that the managers would lead the closures of their stores. Id. at ¶¶ 30-32; (see also Doc. 58-4 at ¶¶ 32, 33). Plaintiff's presence at the particular store she was assigned to visit the next day (when the closures would be announced to associates) was especially important because that store did not have an assistant REM or any other leadership at that time. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 33).
The next day, Defendant conducted two associate calls, the first of which was with associates working at stores closing as early as April, and the second with associates working at stores for which no closing date had been confirmed. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 34).5 Plaintiff was not physically present at the Lenox store (where she was scheduled to be) or at any of her stores on the day the closure calls took place. Id. at ¶ 35. Although Plaintiff notified Ms. Suber the previous day that she [*12]  was out sick, she did not notify any of her managers that she would again be out sick the next day or that she would not be physically present at work. Id. at ¶ 36. Plaintiff participated in the first closure call for the stores that were closing as early as April, but she failed to participate in the second closure call for the stores with uncertain closing dates. Id. at ¶ 37.6 After the closure call, members of Plaintiff's team reached out to her with questions related to the closure but were unable to contact her. Id. at ¶ 38.
After learning that Plaintiff was not physically present for work, was absent from the second closure call, and that her associates could not reach her, Ms. Suber and Kaitlyn Andrus both attempted to contact Plaintiff. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 39). When Ms. Andrus and Ms. Suber reached Plaintiff, she told them that she was out sick with a cold or the flu. Id. at ¶ 40. Plaintiff did not inform any of her managers that she would be unavailable to attend all of the closure calls or to support her team and answer questions from associates. Id. at ¶ 41. As a result, Ms. Suber, in consultation with Ms. Andrus, terminated Plaintiff's employment as an L5 REM on March [*13]  3, 2019. Id. at ¶¶ 42, 45. Ms. Andrus and Ms. Suber were not confident that Plaintiff could manage the store closures. Id. at ¶ 43. Plaintiff admits that "had [she] not been sick . . . and missed that call" then she "probably wouldn't have been terminated." Id. at ¶ 44 (quoting Doc. 59-1 at 176:3-10). At no point during the discussion about Plaintiff's termination was her request for leave, her request for accommodations, or her alleged disability considered or discussed. Id. at ¶ 46.

II. DISCUSSION

A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is authorized when the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show "that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Baas v. Fewless, 886 F.3d 1088, 1091 (11th Cir. 2018). The movant carries this burden by showing the court "that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. In making its determination, the court must view the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Crane v. Lifemark Hosps., Inc., 898 F.3d 1130, 1134 (11th Cir. 2018).
Once the moving [*14]  party has adequately supported its motion, the non-moving party must come forward with specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The non-moving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted). Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the non-moving party's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment; rather, there must be evidence on which a jury could reasonably find for the non-moving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The non-moving party cannot defeat summary judgment by relying upon conclusory assertions. See Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1564 n. 6 (11th Cir. 1997), abrogated on other grounds by Lewis v. City of Union City, 918 F.3d 1213 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc). Rather, "[a] party asserting that a fact . . . is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by . . . citing to particular parts of materials in the record." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A); see also Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995) (en banc) ("There is no burden upon the district court to distill every potential argument that could be made based upon the materials before it on summary judgment.").
If a fact is found to be material, the court must also consider the genuineness of the alleged [*15]  factual dispute. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50. A factual dispute is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Id. A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. at 248. Moreover, for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The non-moving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Id. at 587 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict: "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 259 (internal quotation marks omitted).
When considering motions for summary judgment, the court does not make decisions as to the merits of disputed factual issues. See id. at 249; Ryder Int'l Corp. v. First Am. Nat'l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, the court only determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact [*16]  to be tried. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. Disputed facts that do not resolve or affect the outcome of a suit will not preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id.

B. Motion for Summary Judgment
In Count I of the amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her disability, in violation of the ADA. (Doc. 13 at ¶¶ 29-36). In Count II, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant retaliated against her, in violation of the ADA, by terminating her after she requested reasonable accommodations and leave. Id. at ¶¶ 37-41. In Count III, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant subjected her to a hostile work environment, in violation of Title VII, by exposing her to increased scrutiny and unreasonable expectations. Id. at ¶¶ 42-45. Defendant moves for summary judgment as to all claims. (Doc. 58).

1. Abandoned Claims
As an initial matter, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA retaliation and Title VII hostile work environment claims. (Doc. 58-1 at 21-27). Plaintiff did not respond to either argument in her response brief, (see Doc. 65), and Defendant maintains that she has therefore abandoned these claims by not addressing them, (Doc. 66 at 1-2).
The Court [*17]  agrees that Plaintiff has abandoned these claims. "[T]he onus is upon the parties to formulate arguments; grounds alleged in the complaint but not relied upon in summary judgment are deemed abandoned." Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995); see also Denney v. City of Albany, 247 F.3d 1172, 1182 (11th Cir. 2001) (holding that issues that are not briefed are deemed abandoned); Burnette v. Northside Hosp., 342 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1140 (N.D. Ga. 2004) ("Failure to respond to the opposing party's summary judgment arguments regarding a claim constitutes an abandonment of that claim and warrants the entry of summary judgment for the opposing party."). Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 58), be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim (Count II) and Title VII hostile work environment claim (Count III).

2. ADA Discrimination Claim
The ADA prohibits an employer from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability" concerning hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation, training, job application procedures, or "other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The definition of discriminate includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would [*18]  impose an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). The term "disability" means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
"[T]here are two distinct categories of disability discrimination claims under the ADA: (1) failure to accommodate and (2) disparate treatment." E.E.O.C. v. Eckerd Corp., No. 1:10-CV-2816-JEC, 2012 WL 2568225, at *4 (N.D. Ga. July 2, 2012). The primary difference between a disparate-treatment claim and a failure-to-accommodate claim is that, under a disparate-treatment claim, the plaintiff must prove discriminatory intent, while a discriminatory motive is not necessary for a reasonable-accommodation claim. See Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262-63 (11th Cir. 2007). The Court notes that Plaintiff's amended complaint, despite being drafted with the assistance of counsel, does not make clear whether Plaintiff brings a disparate-treatment claim or a failure-to-accommodate claim in Count I (titled "Violation of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990[,] 42 U.S.C. § 1211[1], et seq., ('ADA'): Disability"), (Doc. 13 at ¶¶ 29-36), and Plaintiff's response brief similarly fails to clearly delineate what claim Plaintiff brings, (see Doc. 65 at 3-11). The Court will therefore construe Count I as attempting to bring both a disparate-treatment claim and a failure-to-accommodate claim [*19]  and consider each in turn.

a. Disparate Treatment
In its motion for summary judgment, Defendant argues as to Count I that Plaintiff has not established the first and third prongs of the prima facie case: that she was disabled or that she was discriminated against because of her disability. (Doc. 58-1 at 14-17). Specifically, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's minor neck, shoulder, and back injury did not substantially limit her ability to perform any major life activities and that the undisputed record establishes that Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment because of concerns about her ability to lead after she failed to attend a closure call, not because of her disability. Id. Defendant further asserts that, even if Plaintiff had established a prima facie case, Defendant has provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her termination, and Plaintiff admits that she likely would not have been terminated if she had not missed the second closure call. Id. at 17-21.
Plaintiff responds that her inability to bend, twist, and carry items greater than ten pounds substantially limited her major life activities such that she was disabled within the meaning of the ADA. (Doc. 65 at [*20]  4-7). With regard to the third prong, that she was discriminated against because of her disability, Plaintiff argues that Defendant "failed to provide [her with] a reasonable accommodation between her . . . injury [and] the date medical approved her to return to work." Id. at 8-9.7 She also argues that Defendant's reason for her termination is pretextual because she "was on approved sick leave" when she missed the second closure call. Id. at 9-11.8 In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to properly identify any disputed issue of material fact as to whether her workplace injury substantially limited her ability to perform any major life activities or as to whether she was subjected to unlawful discrimination as a result of a disability. (Doc. 66 at 5-8). Defendant also contends that Plaintiff has failed to present significant probative evidence of pretext sufficient to survive summary judgment. Id. at 8-11.
Courts examine ADA disparate-treatment claims under the McDonnell Douglas9 burden-shifting framework. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004). Therefore, the initial burden is on the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Id. A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of [*21]  discrimination under the ADA by showing: (1) a disability (or that she was regarded as having a disability); (2) that she was otherwise qualified to perform her job; and (3) that she was discriminated against based upon the disability. Id. Disparate treatment "occurs when a disabled individual is treated differently than a non-disabled or less disabled individual because of his disability." Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007).10 If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden then shifts to the defendant to produce a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination or other adverse employment action. Cleveland, 369 F.3d at 1193. If the defendant does so, the plaintiff must then show that this reason is unworthy of credence and a pretext for discrimination. Id.
Regarding the first element of Plaintiff's prima facie case, "[a]n individual has a disability if she has 'a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of [her] major life activities.'"11 Danielle-DiSerafino v. Dist. Sch. Bd. of Collier Cnty., 756 F. App'x 940, 943 (11th Cir. 2018) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1) (second alteration in original)). Major life activities include performing manual tasks, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, and working. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). "Congress amended the ADA by enacting the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (the 'ADAAA') with the goal of broadening [*22]  the interpretation of a disability under the ADA." Lewis v. City of Union City, 934 F.3d 1169, 1180 (11th Cir. 2019). "[C]ourts are instructed that 'the term "substantially limits" shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA.'" Vaughan v. World Changers Church Int'l, Inc., No. 1:13-CV-0746-AT, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912, 2014 WL 4978439, at *8 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 16, 2014) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i) (alteration omitted)). "Under this more lenient standard, courts consider whether an impairment 'substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population.'" Id. at *9 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(ii)). "[E]ven temporary impairments—those lasting less than six months—can be substantially limiting within the meaning of § 12102(1)(A)." Id. "Despite this generous standard, not every impairment will constitute a disability with[in] the meaning" of the Act. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, "[p]ain alone is insufficient to establish a disability if the evidence does not show impairment of a major life activity." Danielle-DiSerafino, 756 F. App'x at 943 (citing EEOC v. St. Joseph's Hosp., Inc., 842 F.3d 1333, 1344 (11th Cir. 2016)).
Plaintiff asserts that she was actually disabled because of her inability to bend, twist, and carry items greater than ten pounds. (Doc. 65 at 4-6). In support of her claim that her workplace injury to her neck, shoulders, and back substantially limited one or more major life activities, [*23]  Plaintiff asserts that she was restricted by her doctors from prolonged bending or twisting, as well as lifting more than ten pounds, and that she was on leave from November 7, 2018, through early January of 2019. Id. at 5-6.12 Plaintiff's medical records show three sets of work restrictions. First on October 31, 2018, Dr. Efobi diagnosed Plaintiff with ligament sprains of the thoracic spine and neck and allowed her to return to work as of November 7, 2018, with the following work restrictions: avoid prolonged bending over, avoid prolonged twisting, and no lifting over shoulder greater than 20 pounds using either arm. (See Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 18 (citing Doc. 59-1 at 404)). On November 7, 2018, Dr. Petro saw Plaintiff and again listed ligament sprains as the diagnosis, noting that the sprains were improved. See id. at ¶ 21 (citing Doc. 59-1 at 413). Dr. Petro opined that Plaintiff was "fit for duty" with the following work restrictions: avoid climbing ladders, avoid prolonged bending over, avoid prolonged twisting, and no lifting greater than 10 pounds. (See Doc. 59-1 at 413). On December 7, 2018, Dr. Albert saw Plaintiff and opined that Plaintiff could return to work with restrictions, but [*24]  he did not list any specific work restrictions other than a notation to use an elevated workspace. (See Doc. 58-2 at ¶ 23 (citing Doc. 59-1 at 406)).
The undersigned finds that Plaintiff has failed to produce sufficient evidence to raise a jury question regarding whether she was disabled under the terms of the ADA. Plaintiff alleges that her physical impairment affected the major life activities of lifting, twisting, and bending. (See Doc. 65 at 4). Plaintiff points to Dr. Efobi's and Dr. Petro's work restrictions as supporting the conclusion that her injury substantially limited her ability to lift, twist, and bend. Id. at 5-6. However, the first restrictions from Dr. Efobi on October 31, 2018, limited Plaintiff to avoiding prolonged bending, prolonged twisting, or lifting over 20 pounds. (Doc. 59-1 at 404). The next set of restrictions imposed by Dr. Petro on November 7, 2018, contained the same limitation on prolonged bending and twisting, but reduced Plaintiff's lifting restriction to lifting over 10 pounds. Id. at 413. By December 7, 2018, Dr. Albert's work restrictions included only using an elevated workspace, with no specific restrictions on bending, twisting, or [*25]  lifting. Id. at 406. There are no facts in the record regarding any further bending, twisting, or lifting restrictions after December 7, 2018.
In Vaughan, the court found that:
[A]lthough Vaughan's treating physician diagnosed her with several conditions (lumbar sprain/strain, muscle spasms, and an ankle sprain), he offered nothing specific regarding the pain these conditions caused. Vaughan's treating physician did not, even in a conclusory fashion, state that the effects of this pain on her major life activities—the inability to sit or stand for prolonged periods of time—were at all substantial, or at least substantial as compared to most people in the population. Finally, Vaughan's physician . . . anticipated that Vaughan would return to work full-time quickly. This medical certification does not raise an inference that Vaughan suffered from an impairment that substantially limits any major life activity, even under the relaxed standards of the ADAAA.
2014 WL 4978439, at *9. Accordingly, the court in Vaughan determined that the plaintiff had not set forth evidence from which to infer that Vaughan suffered from a disability, within the meaning of the ADA. See id. at *10. So too, here, there is nothing in the record [*26]  showing that Plaintiff's physicians determined that the effects of her back, neck, and shoulder pain (i.e., the temporary lifting, twisting, and bending restrictions) "were at all substantial, or at least substantial as compared to most people in the population." Vaughan, 2014 WL 4978439, at *9-10; see also Sierra v. Port Consol. Jacksonville, L.L.C., No. 3:14-cv-1496-HES-JBT, 2016 WL 927189, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2016) (finding that the plaintiff had not come forward with sufficient evidence to support his argument that he was actually disabled where the plaintiff "provided no evidence that his 50 pound lifting restriction substantially limits the major life activity of lifting more generally"). Rather, the evidence shows that Plaintiff's various bending, twisting, and lifting restrictions were in place for only a few weeks (until December 7, 2018) and the limitations imposed became progressively less restrictive. (See Doc. 59-1 at 404, 406, 413). The Court finds that Plaintiff has not produced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether she was actually disabled.
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff cannot show that she was discriminated against because of her disability. (Doc. 58-1 at 15-17). The Court agrees. Plaintiff has not established that she was treated differently than a non-disabled or less disabled [*27]  individual because of her disability. Nor has Plaintiff made any such argument in her response brief, as she does not argue that she was subjected to any unlawful discrimination other than Defendant's alleged failure to accommodate (and the Court considers that separate failure-to-accommodate claim below). (Doc. 65 at 8-9).
Even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment based on a disability, Defendant has offered a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating her. Specifically, Defendant terminated Plaintiff because she missed the second closure call and did not inform any of her managers that she would not be physically present at work, would not attend the second closure call, and would not be available to answer questions from her team about the call. (Doc. 58-2 at ¶¶ 35-43, 45). And Plaintiff has not demonstrated any pretext or shown any discriminatory intent.13 In fact, Plaintiff admits that had she not been sick and missed the closure call, then she "probably wouldn't have been terminated." Id. at ¶ 44. The Eleventh Circuit has consistently held that an employer "'may fire an employee for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based on erroneous [*28]  facts, or for no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason.'" Connelly v. WellStar Health Sys., Inc., 758 F. App'x 825, 828-29 (11th Cir. 2019) (quoting Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Commc'ns, 738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir. 1984)). Here, Plaintiff has not alleged "any specific evidence that would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that [Defendant's] reasons [for her termination] were pretextual." Id. at 829. Plaintiff therefore cannot succeed on her disparate-treatment claim.

b. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff arguably also alleges a failure-to-accommodate claim in Count I of the amended complaint. (Doc. 13 at ¶¶ 29-36). Plaintiff argues in her response brief that Defendant failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation between the date of her workplace injury and the date that she was approved to return to work. (Doc. 65 at 8). She alleges that Karin Turner's statement in an email that "I would like to better understand why we are not able to accommodate [Plaintiff working from home]" is "proof enough that [Defendant] failed to accommodate" her disability. Id. at 8-9. In reply, Defendant argues that the Court should not consider Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim because it is raised for the first time in her response brief. (Doc. 66 at 11-12). While the Court agrees that, to the extent Plaintiff [*29]  brings a failure-to-accommodate claim in the amended complaint,14 such claim is, at best, inartfully pled, the Court construes the amended complaint as including such a claim out of an abundance of caution.
Unlike with a disparate-treatment claim, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework is not applicable to reasonable-accommodation claims. See Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262 (noting that for a failure-to-accommodate claim, there are no "subsequent burdens on [the defendant] to show that it had any legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for terminating [the plaintiff] or on [the plaintiff] to establish that these reasons were pretextual" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Cappetta v. N. Fulton Eye Ctr., No. 1:15-CV-3412-LMM-JSA, 2017 WL 5197207, at *20 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 1, 2017) ("For those cases in which an employee claims that an employer violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability, however, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting framework does not apply."), adopted by 2017 WL 5443877 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 7, 2017). To establish a prima facie case with respect to a reasonable-accommodation claim, "a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she is disabled; (2) she was a qualified individual when she suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) that she was discriminated against because of her disability [*30]  by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow her to keep working." Cappetta, 2017 WL 5197207, at *25 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262-63. "An employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer fails to provide 'reasonable accommodations' for the disability—unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the employer." McCarroll v. Somerby of Mobile, LLC, 595 F. App'x 897, 899 (11th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).
As discussed above with respect to Plaintiff's disparate-treatment claim, because there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff was disabled, Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case, and her failure-to-accommodate claim fails. Further, even if Plaintiff had established that she was disabled, she has not demonstrated that she was denied a reasonable accommodation to allow her to keep working. The only evidence regarding accommodations that is properly before the Court is that Defendant denied Plaintiff's request to work from home because Plaintiff's L5 REM role required her to be physically present, (Doc. 58-2 at ¶¶ 19, 20), and that Defendant approved accommodations for Plaintiff including not lifting more than 10 pounds, use of an elevated workspace, and purchase of a rolling [*31]  backpack, laptop riser, portable keyboard, and mouse, (id. at ¶ 24).
The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that "an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which that employee desires," explaining that the adjective "reasonable" (in the context of reasonable accommodation) "would be rendered superfluous . . . if employers were required in every instance to provide employees the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible. . . . [U]nder the ADA a qualified individual with a disability is not entitled to the accommodation of her choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285-86 (11th Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). "An accommodation is reasonable . . . if it allows the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). Here, Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that her requested accommodation of working remotely was reasonable or that the accommodations that Defendant approved were not reasonable or did not allow her to perform the essential functions of her job. Plaintiff cannot succeed on her failure-to-accommodate claim.
Because Plaintiff cannot establish discrimination under the ADA based on either disparate [*32]  treatment or failure to accommodate, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that summary judgment be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim (Count I).

III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 58), be GRANTED.
The Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for leave to file matters under seal, (Doc. 69), and the Clerk is DIRECTED to SEAL Doc. 65-3. The Clerk is DIRECTED to UNSEAL Docs. 65, 65-1, and 65-2.
There are no other pending motions in this matter, and the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the undersigned.
IT IS SO ORDERED AND RECOMMENDED, this 17th day of July, 2023.
