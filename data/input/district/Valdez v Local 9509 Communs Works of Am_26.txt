ORDER GRANTING [*2]  IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT PACIFIC BELL'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Doc. No. 57] AND GRANTING DEFENDANT AT&T'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Doc. No. 57-1]

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff originally filed a complaint on April 17, 2009, an amended complaint on July 22, 2009, a second amended complaint on August 20, 2009, and a third amended complaint ("TAC") on December 31, 2010, seeking relief for unlawful discharge and breach of the duty of fair representation under 29 U.S.C. § 185, disability discrimination (California Government Code § 12940 (a)), failure to accommodate (California Government Code § 12940(m)), failure to engage in the interactive process (California Government Code § 12940(n)), harassment (California Government Code § 12900), retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation or making a complaint of disability discrimination (California Government Code § 12900), failure to prevent and remedy harassment (California Government Code § 12940(k)), Family Medical Leave Act (29 U.S.C. § 2615), California Family Rights Act (California Government Code § 12945.2), and tortuous termination/failure to reinstate in violation of public policy. Plaintiff named Pacific Bell, AT&T, Local 9509, Communication Workers ofAmerica, AFL-CIO ("Local 9509"), Communications Workers of America, District 9 ("District 9"), Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO ("International") and Does 1 through 30 inclusive as defendants.1 Plaintiff alleges she was employed as [*3]  a customer service representative with AT&T and a member of Local 9509, and as such was the subject of a collective bargaining agreement between AT&T and the Union Defendants. TAC ¶ 11, 13. During that time, Plaintiff suffered from migraines and requested time off from work. Id. ¶ 18. She further alleges she was forced to take leaves of absence as a result of AT&T's discriminatory conduct following a hospitalization for a mental disability. Id. ¶ 21. Plaintiff alleges AT&T harassed, discriminated and retaliated against her through the date of her discharge. Id. ¶¶ 19, 21 - 23.
Defendant AT&T and Defendant Pacific Bell filed motions for summary judgment, or in the alternative, partial summary judgment on February 1, 2011. Plaintiff filed a response to the motions on May 9, 2011, and Defendants filed replies on June 3, 2011. The parties appeared before this Court and presented oral argument on the motions on July 11, 2011.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is properly granted when "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Entry of summary judgment is appropriate "against a party who fails to make a showing [*4]  sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of establishing an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. Where the party moving for summary judgment does not bear the burden of proof at trial, as here, it may show that no genuine issue of material fact exists by demonstrating that "there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case." Id. at 325. The moving party is not required to produce evidence showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, nor is it required to offer evidence negating the non-moving party's claim. Lujan v. National Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 885, 110 S. Ct. 3177, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1990); United Steelworkers v. Phelps Dodge Corp., 865 F.2d 1539, 1542 (9th Cir. 1989). "Rather, the motion may, and should, be granted so long as whatever is before the District Court demonstrates that the standard for the entry of judgment, as set forth in Rule 56(c), is satisfied." Lujan, 497 U.S. at 885 (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323).
Once the moving party meets the requirements of Rule 56, the burden shifts to the party resisting the motion, who "must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Without specific facts to support the conclusion, a bald assertion of the "ultimate fact" [*5]  is insufficient. See Schneider v. TRW, Inc., 938 F.2d 986, 990-91 (9th Cir. 1991). A material fact is one that is relevant to an element of a claim or defense and the existence of which might affect the outcome of the suit. The materiality of a fact is thus determined by the substantive law governing the claim or defense. Disputes over irrelevant or unnecessary facts will not preclude a grant of summary judgment. T.W. Electrical Service, Inc. v. Pacific Electrical Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987)(citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248).
When making this determination, the court must view all inferences drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. "Credibility determinations, the weighing of evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, [when] ... ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.

DISCUSSION
Defendant Pacific Bell argues it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the claims are time-barred, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate Pacific Bell took an adverse action against her based upon a protected characteristic, and the remaining claims fail as a matter of law.2 Defendant AT&T argues it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because it is not and has never been Plaintiff's employer, Plaintiff's claims are time-barred, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate [*6]  AT&T took an adverse action against her based upon a protected characteristic and the remaining claims fail as a matter of law.

I. Statute of Limitations
Defendants argue Plaintiff's claims for harassment, failure to accommodate, and failure to engage in the interactive process are time-barred to the extent they are related to workplace conduct. Defendants maintain Plaintiff's claims are brought under the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") which provides a one year limitations period. To pursue a lawsuit for violations under the FEHA, a plaintiff must first, within one year from the unlawful act, exhaust her administrative remedies by filing an administrative complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") and obtain a right-to-sue notice. See Cal. Gov. Code § 12960; Holland v. Union Pacific R. Co., 154 Cal.App.4th 940, 65 Cal. Rptr. 3d 145 (2007). Because Plaintiff's DFEH complaint was filed on April 13, 2009, Defendants argue any claims for acts occurring before April 13, 2008 are time-barred.
In opposition, Plaintiff argues the claims are not barred pursuant to the continuing violation doctrine. She maintains she alleges a series of acts of harassment, discrimination and retaliation that formed a basis of a continuing violation from 2006 through the [*7]  date of her termination in May 2008, including denial of health keys3, derogatory comments and denial of reasonable accommodations.
In reply, Defendants argue the continuing violation doctrine does not apply and Plaintiff's assertion that the harassment continued to the date of termination is specious and contrary to law.
Under California's continuing violation doctrine, claims for an employer's conduct outside the one year limitations period are viable if the conduct is "sufficiently linked to unlawful conduct that occurred within the limitations period." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1056, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). An employer's conduct is a "continuing violation if the employer's unlawful actions are (1) sufficiently similar in kind. . . (2) have occurred with reasonable frequency; (3) and have not acquired a degree of permanence." Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal.4th 798, 823, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001).
Plaintiff's allegations supporting her claims under the FEHA allege conduct by Defendant up to and including termination on May 6, 2008. She contends her coach leader made comments that she was taking advantage of the system during the 2005 - 2006 time period; her coach leader suspended her for three days for a code of conduct violation but did not follow proper procedure; and her requests for health [*8]  keys were denied and instead she was sent home. Valdez Depo. 156:25 - 157:4; 160:21 - 25; 185:25 - 186:15; 190:15 - 191:16; 195:15 - 196:8, Pla's Exh. 3. She further maintains she requested health keys in 2007 for panic attacks but was denied and was suspended for poor attendance and the harassment, including constant monitoring increased from January 2007 through May 2008. Valdez Depo. 144:12 - 145:8; 191:15-21; Scherden Depo. 84:25 - 85:10.
This Court finds there is a factual dispute as to whether the conduct occurring prior to April 13, 2008, is sufficiently similar in kind to the acts occurring after that date. Accordingly, Defendants are not entitled to judgment as to the timeliness of the claims brought under the FEHA.

II. Whether Plaintiff was an Employee of AT&T
Defendant AT&T contends the claims brought against it require a special relationship, namely an employment relationship. Defendant argues no employment relationship existed between Plaintiff and AT&T to support the claims.

A. FEHA Claims
AT&T maintains summary judgment is appropriate, because no such relationship as defined by the FEHA exists between Plaintiff and Defendant AT&T. Defendant maintains it had no control over [*9]  the day-to-day supervision or discipline of Plaintiff, did not determine her work schedule, pay rates or method of payment, did not pay, hire or terminate Plaintiff and, therefore, did not exercise any control over her performance or duties as required to be considered an employer. AT&T further maintains its Employer Relations Manager, Gonzalez, was merely responsible for managing the leave of absence that was not approved under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") or disability but allowed by Defendant Pacific Bell.
Plaintiff argues AT&T acted as Pacific Bell's agent when Gonzalez provided human resources support, including mailing out company initiated leave ("CIL") letters and 5-day letters that resulted in the decision to terminate Plaintiff.
In reply, AT&T argues California courts do not utilize the general definition of "agent" to analyze the employment relationship under the FEHA.
Under the FEHA, an employer is "any person regularly employing five or more persons, or any person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly, the state or any political or civil subdivision of the state, and cities. . .except an employer does not include a religious association or corporation [*10]  not organized for private profit." Cal. Gov. Code § 12926(d). To determine whether a party is an employer subject to the FEHA a court considers the "totality of the circumstances" which looks to the nature of the parties' relationship and focuses on the extent to which the defendant controls the plaintiff's performance of her duties. See Vernon v. State, 116 Cal.App.4th 114, 124, 10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 121 (2004).
The only evidence Plaintiff relies upon in support of her contention that AT&T acted as an employee is the letters sent out by Gonzalez. Looking at the totality of the circumstances, including the lack of any evidence demonstrating AT&T controlled Plaintiff's performance of her duties, there is insufficient evidence to support Plaintiff's claim that AT&T is liable as an employer for claims brought under the FEHA. Accordingly, AT&T is entitled to the judgment as to the claims brought against it under the FEHA.

B. FMLA Claims
Defendant AT&T argues it is not an employer under the FMLA. Defendant maintains AT&T had no economic relationship with Plaintiff and had no control over her employment. Defendant further maintains Pacific Bell was Plaintiff's sole employer.
The FMLA defines an employer as "any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce who [*11]  employs 50 or more employees . . ." 29 U.S.C. § 2611. An employer includes any person who acts in the interest of the employer and any successor in interest to the employer. See id. The definition of employer in the FMLA is substantially similar to the definition in the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") and courts have looked to cases interpreting the definition provided in the FLSA. See Morrow v. Putnam, 142 F.Supp.2d 1271 (D.Nev. 2001); Mercer v. Borden, 11 F.Supp.2d 1190 (C.D.Cal. 1998). Whether a defendant qualifies as an employer depends on the "circumstances of the whole activity." Gilbreath v. Cutter Biological, Inc., 931 F.2d 1320 (9th Cir. 1991). "Where an individual exercises control over the nature and structure of the employment relationship, or economic control over the relationship, that individual is an employer within the meaning of the [FLSA] and is subject to liability." Boucher v. Shaw, 572 F.3d 1087, 1091 (9th Cir. 2009).
Looking to the circumstances as a whole, in the absence of evidence demonstrating AT&T exerted any control over Plaintiff's employment or over the nature and structure of her employment relationship with Pacific Bell, the letters sent by Gonzalez are insufficient to demonstrate AT&T acted as an employer under the FMLA. Accordingly, AT&T is entitled to judgment on the FMLA claim.

III. Retaliation and Discrimination Claims
Defendants [*12]  argue Plaintiff's retaliation and discrimination claims fail as a matter of law.

A. Retaliation Claim
To establish a prima facie claim for retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show "(1) she engaged in a protected activity, (2) [the defendant] subjected her to an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between the two." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal.App.4th 952, 989, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to "offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action." Id. If the defendant makes the necessary showing, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove intentional retaliation. See id.
Defendants argue Plaintiff cannot make out a claim for retaliation under the FEHA because she did not engage in a protected activity. Defendants further argue Pacific Bell terminated Plaintiff for a legitimate reason, Plaintiff's absence from work for two weeks beyond the expiration of her medical certification and four weeks beyond her approved leave, without a current medical certification and her failure to communicate with anyone at her employment. Adams Depo. 55:12 - 15, Def's Exh. 22; Scherden Depo. 144:7 - 11, Def's Exh. 7; Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 12.
 [*13] In opposition, Plaintiff lists the reasonable accommodations she requested and argues the evidence establishes the requests were denied. She contends she presents evidence of retaliation for requesting reasonable accommodations by demonstrating she was monitored and counseled excessively, subjected to derogatory comments such as whether she wanted to remain employed by the company, and terminated and not reinstated.
Plaintiff alleges retaliation for requesting accommodations and for making a complaint of disability discrimination. These are protected activities. See Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal.App.4th at 990. Defendants present evidence that Plaintiff was terminated for a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason. Defendant sent Plaintiff a letter informing her the CIL was extended through May 4, 2008, and she was directed to supply medical certification no later than May 5, 2008 or report to work no later than May 5, 2008. Def's Exh. 20. The letter also informed her failure to comply would result in termination. See id.
Plaintiff testifies that her coach leader made comments that Valdez was "milking" the system, that she was subject to increased monitoring and more counseling, and she had trouble with her passwords upon returning to [*14]  work and it would take awhile to fix them and was told she would not be working for the company much longer. Valdez Depo. 160:21-25; 176:6 - 177:8; 706:7 - 11; 364:21 - 365:11; 368:22 - 369:1; 369:1 - 371:2. The Court finds this evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff's termination was the result of intentional retaliation. Accordingly, the motion is denied as to the retaliation claim.

B. Discrimination Claim
California uses the three-part burden shifting test established by the Supreme Court for claims of discrimination. See Scotch v. Art Institute of California-Orange County, Inc., 173 Cal.App.4th 986, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338. Under the test, an employee must make a prima facie showing that the employer engaged in conduct, if unexplained, that was based upon discriminatory criterion. See Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal.4th 317, 355, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). If Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to "articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the conduct. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). If the defendant is able to make the showing, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show the reason offered is merely a pretext for discrimination. Id.
Defendant Pacific Bell argues it produced evidence of its legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action in terminating Plaintiff and [*15]  Plaintiff cannot present evidence of pretext.
Plaintiff argues she provides evidence that she was a member of a protected class as she suffered from migraines and a mental disability. She further argues she was performing her work competently. Plaintiff contends she was terminated pursuant to a misdated 5-day letter and a comment that she would not be reinstated due to her poor attendance record which was due primarily to her disabilities.
For the reasons discussed above, Plaintiff presents evidence providing a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her termination was the result of discrimination. Accordingly, the motion is denied as to the discrimination claims.

IV. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process and Failure to Accommodate
Under the FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer to "fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee. . .to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee. . .with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition" Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n). Both parties are required to participate in the interactive process, and "if the process fails, responsibility for [*16]  the failure rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal.App.4th 34, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006). "Liability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication." Scotch v. Art Institute of California-Orange County, Inc., 173 Cal.App.4th 986, 1014, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009).

A. Plaintiff's Limitations
Defendants argue Plaintiff is responsible for the alleged breakdown of the interactive process because she failed to submit medical certification establishing any work limitations to receive additional breaks, and she was returned from leave with no restrictions on her work hours or functions. They further argue Plaintiff never indicated a restriction or limitation to support her request for a transfer or promotion. Defendants maintain there is no evidence that Plaintiff articulated the majority of requests she now states Pacific Bell refused.
Plaintiff argues Pacific Bell failed to engage in the interactive process to determine if she needed an accommodation.
Plaintiff's testifies that she requested various accommodations including health keys, a transfer to a closed key or RD position, training upon her return from disability and being provided passwords in a timely manner. Valdez Depo. 173:7 - 23; 185:23 - 186:1; 190:15 - 191:4; 191:15 - 21; 192:20 - 193:24; 387:10 - 18; Cante [*17]  Depo. 95:21 - 24. While she admits she did not provide a doctor's note to support her requested accommodations, she maintains the doctor explained that she needed additional breaks during the day. Valdez Depo. 405:15 - 23; 392:14 - 24; 501:14 - 20.
Defendants argue summary judgment is appropriate because Plaintiff failed to provide medical certification to support her requested accommodations and rely on Houston v. Regents of University of California, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27644, 2006 WL 1141238 (N.D. Cal.) in support. In granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process claims, the court in Houston found the plaintiff did not provide any medical certification showing the need for any particular accommodation, the plaintiff admitted in her deposition that the defendant granted all her requests for accommodation except for a transfer, she was asked repeatedly to provide medical documentation but failed to do so, the defendant contacted the plaintiff's treating physician for clarification and requested the plaintiff sign a release of medical information, which she refused, and the defendant granted all the plaintiff's requests with the exception of a transfer which was not reasonable or feasible. The court [*18]  considered the plaintiff's failure to obtain medical certification along with other evidence in issuing its ruling. It did not clearly hold that medical certification is required, and this Court's own research did not locate any cases holding such. In this case, Defendant points to one instance where Plaintiff was asked to provide documentation and failed to do so, additionally, there is a question as to whether Defendant attempted to discuss or obtain additional information regarding Plaintiff's various requests for accommodations.4
The Court finds there is a genuine issue of material fact as to which party is responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process.

B. Reasonableness of Accommodations
Defendants argue the accommodations Plaintiff requested were not reasonable as a matter of law. Pursuant to section 12940(m), an employer is not required to make an accommodation that produces an undue hardship. Defendants maintain Plaintiffs' request to be transferred to an RD or a closed key position was not reasonable because a transfer to an RD position would be a promotion and there were no open closed key positions.
An employer is not required to provide a promotion, or add a position. See Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215 (2006); [*19] Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal.App.4th 1376, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000). However, it is not clear from the evidence that the RD position was a promotion. While Steve Scherden testified an RD position was "management backfill", he suggested a service representative could fill the position. Scherden Depo. (Exh. 7) 36:22 - 37:5. The evidence is also not clear as to whether or not there were any closed key positions available. Adams Depo. (Exh. 22) 41:18 - 25; 101:19 - 102:7. As such there is a dispute as to whether Plaintiff's requested accommodations were reasonable.

C. Whether Pacific Bell Accommodated Plaintiff
Defendant Pacifc Bell argues they provided all medically substantiated request for accommodations by Plaintiff and insist that is all the law requires. However, as discussed above, there is no case law to support Defendant's contention that it need only provide accommodations for those limitations for which Plaintiff has a medical certification to support.
As such, the motion for summary judgment as to the failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to make reasonable accommodations is denied.

V. Harassment Claims
A prima facie case of harassment under the FEHA requires a showing that (1) the plaintiff belongs to a protected group, [*20]  (2) the plaintiff was subject to unwelcome harassment because he was a member of the group; and (3) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment. See Thompson v. City of Monrovia, 186 Cal.App.4th 860, 876, 112 Cal. Rptr. 3d 377 (2010); Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1043, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009).
Defendants argue Plaintiff's harassment claims based upon the management-related actions fall outside the scope of harassment because they are not related to her disability. They further argue, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate the acts were sufficiently severe or pervasive.
Plaintiff argues she suffered several forms of harassment, including more frequent monitoring, unfair counseling, and issues with her password, questions about whether she was interested in working for the company and discussions about her medications.
"[H]arassment consists of a type of conduct not necessary for performance of a supervisory job. Instead, harassment consists of conduct outside the scope of necessary job performance, conduct presumably engaged in for personal gratification. . ." Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics, 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 63, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996).
Aside for Plaintiff's allegations that she was questioned about her medications, all the alleged harassing conduct involves job performance which does not support a claim for harassment. Plaintiff contends [*21]  she was asked what medications she was taking more than once and testifies to two occasions. Valdez Depo. 146:13; 149:7 - 150:13. This Court finds that Plaintiff fails to demonstrate the alleged harassment of asking her about her medication on two occasions is "sufficiently pervasive" to support an abusive working environment. See Lyle v. Warner Bros. Television Productions, 38 Cal.4th 264, 284, 42 Cal. Rptr. 3d 2, 132 P.3d 211 (2006) ("[A]n employee generally cannot recover for harassment that is occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial; rather the employee must show a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated, routine or a generalized nature."). The Court further finds that to the extent questions about her wanting to work for the company or statements that she would not be working there much longer are outside the scope of job performance, Plaintiff likewise fails to demonstrate the harassment was pervasive. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to judgment on the harassment claim.

VI. Failure to Prevent and Remedy Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation
Pursuant to section 12940(k) of California Government Code, an employer has a duty to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring. To prevail on a claim for failure to prevent discrimination or harassment, a plaintiff must demonstrate "1) [*22]  plaintiff was subjected to discrimination, harassment or retaliation; 2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination, harassment or retaliation; and 3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Lelaind v. City and County of San Francisco, 576 F.Supp.2d 1079 (2008). Defendants argue Plaintiff's claims for failing to prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation fail to the extent that her underlying claims for harassment, discrimination and retaliation fail as argued above. They further argue there is no legal basis for the retaliation claim in that the statutory text of the statute discusses discrimination and not harassment.
As discussed above Plaintiff fails to demonstrate harassment, however, the Court finds there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was discrimination and retaliation. Therefore, the claim brought pursuant to section 12940(k) survives.

VII. Tortuous Termination and Failure to Reinstate in Violation of Public Policy
Defendant argues Plaintiff's claims for tortuous termination in violation of public policy fail to the same extent the underlying FEHA claims fail as discussed above. Because the Court finds a genuine issue of material fact exists as to certain underlying FEHA [*23]  claims, the motion is denied as to this claim.

VIII. Punitive Damages
Defendant argues Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages fails because she is unable to allege any of the unlawful acts were committed by an officer or managing agent as required to support the claim. A plaintiff may recover punitive damages in an action brought under FEHA where the defendant is "guilty of oppression, fraud or malice." Commodore Home Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court, 32 Cal.3d 211, 215, 185 Cal. Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912 (1982). Punitive damages against a corporate employer is permitted only if the conduct at issue was performed or ratified by an "officer, director, or managing agent." See Cal.Civ. Code 3294(b); Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal.App.4th 34, 63, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006).
Plaintiff fails to present any evidence that those individuals that discriminated or retaliated against her were officers, directors, or managing agents. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to judgment on the claim for punitive damages.

CONCLUSION AND ORDER
