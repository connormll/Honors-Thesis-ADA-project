Report and Recommendation
Petitioner, Steven Vernon Bixby ("Bixby"), is an inmate in the custody of the South Carolina Department of Corrections under a sentence of death for murder, kidnapping, assault with intent to kill, and possession of a firearm during a violent crime. This matter is before the court on Bixby's counseled petition for a writ of habeas corpus ("Petition") pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254.2 (Docs. #72, 72-1, 80.)3 Respondents have filed a Motion for Summary [*2]  Judgment and Return and Memorandum in support thereof (collectively, the "Return"). (Docs. #83, 84.) In response, Bixby filed a Traverse and Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Respondents' Motion for Summary Judgment ("Traverse"). (Doc. #92.)

BACKGROUND4
In December 2003, while working on a construction project in Abbeville County, officials from the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) encountered the Bixby family. In order to expand SC-72, the SCDOT planned to take advantage of a right of way it held across the Bixbys' property. The Bixbys did not believe that the SCDOT held a right of way across their property and, beginning on December 4, 2003, threatened violence to prevent any construction on their land. These threats culminated in the murders of Deputy Wilson and Constable Donnie Ouzts on Monday, December 8, 2003.
The following is a chronological description of the events which resulted in the murders:

Thursday, December 4, 2003
On the morning of December 4, 2003, SCDOT officials first met the Bixby family after discovering someone had tampered with the surveyor's stakes on the family's property. SCDOT Construction Superintendent Glen McCaffrey approached the Bixby [*3]  home to discuss the road widening project. McCaffrey was accompanied by fellow SCDOT employees Dale Williams and Mike Hannah.
Superintendent McCaffrey showed the construction plans to [Bixby], his mother, Rita Bixby, and father, Arthur Bixby, and attempted to persuade them that the SCDOT held a right of way across their property. The Bixbys responded with threats of violence and claimed they would fight to the death if anyone tried to do any construction work on the property. Right of Way Agent Williams told them that SCDOT officials would have to get the Sheriff involved, to which the Bixbys responded that they would kill law enforcement officials if anyone "trespassed" on their property.
SCDOT officials McCaffrey, Williams, and Hannah went to the Sheriff's department, reported the encounter, and conveyed that there was a "serious situation" at the Bixby home. Because these men feared the Bixbys' threats, they requested that an officer be assigned to mediate the situation.

Friday, December 5, 2003
Around noon on Friday, December 5, 2003, [Bixby] discussed the road construction project with Dr. Mark Horton, a dentist whose office was near the Bixby home. Steven Bixby and Dr. Horton talked [*4]  about dealings with the SCDOT. Horton told Steven Bixby that he had hired an Attorney and that Dr. Horton, his lawyer, and the SCDOT had set a time to discuss the construction's impact on Horton's property. Describing his conversation with [Bixby], Horton testified as follows:
. . . first he told me that he was from New Hampshire and he said that, you know, their motto was something like, you know, if I can't—I'd rather be dead if I can't be free, something like that. And at one point he said that, I've got something that's going to blow this whole project out of the water, and I took that to mean that he had some information or something. But he was becoming somewhat agitated and I kept telling him that, well, I thought it best if he'd get an attorney and look over his situation and see if they could resolve it. So basically I wished him well and told him that you need to get an attorney, that I had to get one, and I hoped that things would get resolved. But you know, he did seem agitated and he said at one point I think that, they'll take my land over my cold, dead body.
At approximately 3:30 p.m., SCDOT Superintendent McCaffrey contacted Rita Bixby, informing her that he had documents [*5]  concerning the right of way. Also on the phone with McCaffrey were Williams, Hannah, and Joe McCurry, a fellow SCDOT employee. McCaffrey requested that the Bixbys and SCDOT officials meet the following Monday (December 8, 2003) to discuss the right of way. Rita responded by saying, "Anything you got is lies." Although eventually agreeing to the December 8, 2003 meeting, Rita said that if the men wanted to show her the documents they could meet her at the family's home in five minutes. Three of the SCDOT officials left to meet with Rita. Williams, however, refused to go because he feared the situation might become violent.
When the SCDOT officials arrived at the Bixby home, Rita told them that the documents were forgeries and threatened that her family "would fight till the last breath and there would be hell to pay." She demanded that no construction take place. McCaffrey said they would have to come back with a deputy. Rita replied that the Sheriff's department had no authority over them on private property.

Sunday, December 7, 2003
On the evening of December 7, 2003, [Bixby] went to a social gathering at the home of Alane Taylor, his former girlfriend. [Bixby] told Alane, "Tomorrow [*6]  is the day." Alane asked Steven to explain and he said, "We have all the guns loaded in my dad's house and if anybody comes in the yard we will shoot and if the shooting starts I won't come out alive." Steven also said that this had been planned for some time and that his mother Rita planned to take his brother to Steven's apartment while Steven and Arthur stayed at the house. Alane attempted to talk Steven out of his planned violence.
Additionally, while at Alane's house, [Bixby] told Alane's daughter, Dana Newton, he intended to shoot law enforcement if they came on his parents' property. Newton testified that [Bixby] said, "I will, I'll blow their mother f****** heads off if they step one step onto my parent's property. I will."
Alane and Dana called Abbeville Deputy Barry New, a relative, and told him about Steven Bixby's comments. They said they were concerned that harm would come to anyone that went to the Bixby home. Deputy New called his supervisor and left a message conveying the warnings.

Monday, December 8, 2003
At 8:30 a.m. on Monday, December 8, 2003, Deputy Wilson met with SCDOT officials McCaffrey, Williams, and Hannah to discuss SCDOT's prior confrontation with the Bixbys [*7]  and plan for that morning's meeting with the family. After discussing the matter, Deputy Wilson headed straight to the Bixby home. SCDOT officials Williams and Hannah left shortly thereafter.
As Williams and Hannah approached the Bixby home in their vehicle, they noticed that Deputy Wilson's car was in the driveway. However, Deputy Wilson was nowhere to be seen. Williams and Hannah drove past the Bixby home for fear that it was not safe. They drove past again and noticed that the blinds were closed but peep holes were cut into them. The third time they drove past the house they saw [Bixby] standing in the doorway holding a pistol in one hand and a rifle in the other.
At around 9:30 a.m., [Bixby] placed a phone call to his mother, Rita, who was at [Bixby's] apartment with his brother. [Bixby] informed Rita that the shooting had begun. Rita placed phone calls to the Governor's office, the Attorney General's office, and Dr. Craig Gagnon, a family friend and local chiropractor. Dr. Gagnon went to the Bixby residence.
Arriving at the Bixby home at approximately 9:40 a.m., Dr. Gagnon saw two law enforcement officers standing in the front yard of the Bixby home. He heard a shot come from the [*8]  home and saw Constable Ouzts fall to the ground, mortally wounded. As news of the confrontation spread, several officers arrived and were able to retrieve Constable Ouzts's body. Additionally, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) dispatched approximately fifty agents and tactical support.
After determining Rita's whereabouts, David Alford, an investigator with the Abbeville County Sheriff's Department, apprehended her at [Bixby's] apartment and transported her to a temporary command center near the Bixby home. While at the command center, Rita refused to help Alford and the SLED agents diffuse the situation stating, "Why would I want to help you, I wanted to be inside with them today but they made me stay outside to tell the world why they died." All other attempts to contact [Bixby] and his father inside the home were unsuccessful.
At approximately 7:30 p.m., SLED sent robots equipped with cameras toward the house where they were able to peer through a window. The cameras captured footage of Deputy Wilson, who was face down on the floor of the Bixbys' living room with his hands cuffed behind him. He was dead. A team of officers entered the home and retrieved Deputy Wilson's [*9]  body, which was already stiff from rigor mortis.
At approximately 8:55 p.m., SLED sent another robot into the Bixby home. Arthur fired a shot at the robot, and he and [Bixby] began firing at the officers outside the house. The officers returned fire and shot tear gas into the home.
The gun fight continued until approximately 9:25 p.m. when [Bixby] surrendered and notified police that Arthur was wounded. Again, a robot was sent into the house. Video transmitted by the robot confirmed that Arthur had been shot and was sitting on the bathroom floor surrounded by weapons. At approximately 11:00 p.m., Arthur crawled into the living room and surrendered to authorities.
State v. Bixby, 698 S.E.2d at 576-78.

The Trial
In August 2004, an Abbeville grand jury indicted Bixby on one count of conspiracy to commit murder, one count of kidnapping, two counts of murder, one count of possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of a violent crime, and twelve counts of assault with intent to kill (04-GS-01-321, -322). (See Doc. #22-6 at 138-43, App. 4428-33.)5
At trial, Bixby was represented by attorneys E. Charles Grose and William N. Nettles.6 On February 18, 2007, a jury found Bixby guilty of all charges. (See Doc. [*10]  #22-2 at 184, 214-19, App. 3156, 3186-91.) Following the penalty phase, the jury recommended a sentence of death on both murder charges, finding the State had proven the following statutory aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) murder of a state or local law enforcement officer during or because of his official duties; (2) murder of an officer of the Court during or because of the exercise of his official duty; and (3) two or more persons were murdered by the defendant by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct. (See Doc. #22-3 at 143-48, App. 3615-20.) On February 21, 2007, the Circuit Court sentenced Bixby to death for the murders of Officer Wilson and Constable Ouzts.7 (See Doc. #22-3 at 152-53, App. 3624-25.)

The Direct Appeal
On appeal, Bixby, through counsel Robert M. Dudek and LaNelle DuRant, raised the following thirteen issues:

(Guilt phase)

1
Whether the court erred by ruling defense counsel could no longer voir dire jurors to assure that they understood that murder was the intentional killing of another human being without excuse since the court's ruling denied appellant his right under Morgan v. Illinois to identify death prone unqualified jurors? [*11] 

2
Whether the court erred by refusing to allow defense witness Patrick White, who operated his own title abstracting company, to testify about his title search for the right of way at issue, since White's testimony that he would not have searched at the Abbeville Department of Transportation maintenance shed for a right of way was relevant, and appellant also had the right to rebut the state's evidence about the title search for the right of way, since appellant had the right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment to present a complete defense?

3
Whether the court erred by refusing to allow Rita Bixby to testify that she did not hire a lawyer to handle the land dispute, that gave rise to the events here because she had extensive experience in New Hampshire successfully handling court matters on her own without an attorney, since this testimony was relevant to rebut the state's repeated assertions that the Bixbys could have hired a lawyer to settle the land dispute with the government rather than attempting to do so on their own?

4
Whether the court erred by not ruling the court ordered mental evaluation compelling appellant to answer questions about the facts of his case violated the Fifth Amendment and Article I, § 12 of the South Carolina Constitution and, therefore, granted [*12]  him transactional immunity?

5
Whether the court erred by refusing to charge the jury pursuant to State v. Burkhart that the state had the burden of disproving all of the elements of self-defense since that was a correct instruction of the law, and the court erred by refusing to charge it?

6
Whether the court erred by allowing reply witness David Alford to testify that Rita Bixby told him appellant wanted her outside the family home to "tell the world why they died" on the day of the shooting, since a proper foundation was not laid for Ms. Bixby to confirm or deny that she made this statement during her testimony as required by Rule 613(b), SCRE and this procedural error was highly prejudicial to appellant?

7
Whether the court erred by allowing Alane Taylor to testify as a reply witness that Rita Bixby told her she wanted to be present when the shooting occurred and that she would shoot someone if necessary, since the solicitor did not lay the proper foundation as mandated by Rule 613(b), SCRE, because Rita Bixby was not asked the proper time, place and substance questions, and given a chance to explain, and this reply testimony was highly prejudicial?

8
Whether the court erred by allowing Sheriff Charles Goodwin to testify [*13]  that Rita Bixby told him on the date of the fatal incident that she had called the Attorney General's Office, and that she hung up the phone when he requested her to help him with the situation, since a proper foundation was not laid to give Ms. Bixby the opportunity to confirm or deny making this statement to Sheriff Goodwin as mandated by Rule 613(b), SCRE and this highly prejudicial allegation was prejudicial to appellant's case?

9
Whether the Court of Appeals erred by ruling that S.C. Code § 17-30-10 et. seq. does not violate the prohibition against unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Article I, § 12 of the South Carolina Constitution and the right to privacy contained in Article I, § 12 of the South Carolina Constitution?

10
Whether the Court of Appeals erred by ruling that SLED complied with S.C. Code 17-30-10, et. seq. When it did not obtain prior written approval for the wiretap, the record does not demonstrate that Circuit Judge Johnson had the necessary authorization to authorize a wiretap, and where the record demonstrates no basis to invoke the emergency procedures of S.C. Code § 17-30-95?

11
Whether the Court of Appeals erred by not convening an evidentiary hearing as required by law to resolve factual discrepancies and to develop a complete record to determine whether SLED complied with S.C. Code 17-30-10, et. seq. in obtaining a wiretap?

Penalty phase

12
Whether appellant's death sentence should [*14]  be vacated pursuant to South Carolina Code § 16-3-[25](C)(1) because the court admitted a professionally prepared videotape of Deputy Wilson's funeral which was manipulated to elicit an outpouring of sympathy since this introduced an arbitrary factor into the sentencing hearing in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the above statute?

13
Whether the court erred by ordering appellant to be evaluated by the Department of Mental Health for the sole purpose of inquiring into his penalty phase mitigation case since this violated appellant's rights under the Eighth Amendment and such an evaluation was not authorized by statute or case law and Dr. Richard Frierson's testimony emanating from the evaluation was prejudicial?
(Doc. #22-7 at 136-39, App. 4608-11.)
On August 16, 2010, after full briefing, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed Bixby's convictions and sentence. See State v. Bixby, 388 S.C. 528, 698 S.E.2d 572 (S.C. 2010), (Doc. #22-8 at 75-94, App. 4971-90.) Bixby petitioned for rehearing, and the court denied that petition on September 23, 2010. Remittitur issued the same day.
Bixby appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's decision through a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, raising the following issues:

1.
In Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 119 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1992), this Court held that a capital defendant has a right [*15]  to identify and challenge any juror who would automatically vote for a death sentence in every murder case. In this case, despite clear indications of juror confusion, the trial judge cut off counsel's efforts to determine whether prospective jurors understood that "murder" encompasses only intentional and malicious killings, and also declined to instruct them itself on this point during jury selection. Did this limitation on the right to identify jurors who would automatically impose the death penalty on anyone convicted of murder violate Morgan?

2.
During petitioner's capital sentencing hearing, the prosecution played and replayed a videotape of the emotional climax of a police victim's burial service, including footage of a staged 911 call from the fallen officer in which he requests and receives permission to "come home," and the grief-stricken reactions of unidentified mourners. Did this evidence violate the Eighth Amendment or the rule of Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 111 S. Ct. 2597, 115 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1991), against victim impact evidence that is "so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair" in violation of the Due Process Clause?
(Doc. #22-8 at 96, App. 4992.)
On April 25, 2011, after full briefing, the United States Supreme Court denied Bixby's petition. [*16]  (See Doc. #23-1 at 174, App. 5146.)

The Post-Conviction Relief Action
Bixby filed his initial post-conviction relief ("PCR") application on April 25, 2011. (See Doc. #23-1 at 175-80, App. 5147-52.) Subsequently, the PCR court appointed attorneys John R. Mills and Dan Westbrook to represent Bixby. (See Doc. #23-1 at 217-18, App. 5189-90.) On November 24, 2012, through Mr. Mills and Mr. Westbrook, Bixby filed his fifth amended PCR application and raised the following claims:
10(a) Ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, sections Three and Fourteen of the South Carolina Constitution, and section 17-3-20 of the South Carolina Code. Trial counsel's performance was both unreasonable and prejudicial as outlined below. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984).
11(a) Trial counsel failed to object to the trial judge instructing the jurors they could infer malice from the use of a deadly weapon. Trial counsel did not object to this improper instruction.
10(b) Ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, sections Three and Fourteen of the South Carolina Constitution, and section 17-3-20 of the South Carolina Code. Trial counsel's performance was both unreasonable and prejudicial as outlined below. See Strickland, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.
11(b) Trial counsel failed to call Patrick White during the penalty [*17]  phase of the trial to testify that the Department of Transportation right of way in front of Applicant's parents' house was not filed with the Abbeville County Clerk of Court. This evidence was relevant mitigation evidence pertaining to Applicant's state of mind. The State offered evidence attempting to show the applicant and his family were aware of a legitimate right of way on their property. White's testimony would have effectively rebutted that evidence and given relevant evidence of applicant Steven Bixby's state of mind.
10(c) Ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, sections Three and Fourteen of the South Carolina Constitution, and section 17-3-10 of the South Carolina Code. Appellate counsel's performance was both unreasonable and prejudicial as outlined below. See Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S. Ct. 585, 100 L. Ed. 891 (1993); see also Strickland, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.
11(c) Appellate counsel raised in the appellate brief, but failed to adequately brief, the application of a procedural bar that the South Carolina Supreme Court prevented review of the claim that voir dire was unduly restricted. The procedural bar in question had never been applied to bar review in circumstances similar to Applicant's and appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately brief this issue [*18]  prior to the Petition for Rehearing or Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. Moreover, appellate counsel failed to adequately brief the substance of the claim that trial counsel was unduly limited in voir dire of the jury because the trial judge stopped trial counsel from defining murder for the potential jurors and refused to do so himself.
10(d) Jury misconduct in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, sections Three and Fourteen of the South Carolina Constitution, and section 16-3-20 of the South Carolina Code. See also State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 503 S.E.2d 214 (1998); State v. Joyner, 289 S.C. 436, 346 S.E.2d 711 (1986), State v. Pierce, 289 S.C. 430, 346 S.E.2d 707 (1986) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315).
11(d) During the guilt phase the jury reached the conclusion that Mr. Bixby was the shooter in the incident giving rise to the charges. Once some members of the jury reached that conclusion, they foreclosed the possibility of a life sentence.
10(e) Instructional error in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, sections Three and Fourteen of the South Carolina Constitution, section 16-3-20 of the South Carolina Code, and South Carolina common law. See State v. Belcher, 385 S.C. 597, 685 S.E.2d 802 (2009).
11(e) The trial judge instructed the jurors they could infer malice from the use of a deadly weapon, an improper instruction.
10(f) Ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, sections Three and Fourteen of the South Carolina [*19]  Constitution, and section 17-3-20 of the South Carolina Code. Trial counsel's performance was both unreasonable and prejudicial as outlined below. See Strickland, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.
11(f) Trial counsel failed to investigate, develop, and present Mr. Bixby's social history. Trial counsel failed to recognized the independent mitigating force of character and background information, conduct a thorough investigation of Mr. Bixby's background, and develop and present readily available mitigating evidence through lay witnesses and documents of that background. Trial counsel failed to investigate, review, or integrate into the defense strategy information concerning Mr. Bixby and his family, the environmental factors—including exposure to trauma—that affected his behavior personally, and mental functioning, allowing the prosecutor to portray a distorted and aggravated image of Mr. Bixby.
10(g) Ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, sections Three and Fourteen of the South Carolina Constitution, and section 17-3-20 of the South Carolina Code. Trial counsel's performance was both unreasonable and prejudicial as outlined below. See Strickland, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.
11(g) Trial counsel unreasonably failed to consult with, retain, and present the testimony of a social history expert to testify on Mr. Bixby's [*20]  behalf in order to synthesize, interpret, and provide a mitigating context of Mr. Bixby's genetic make-up, education, other environmental factors, traumatic events, and other relevant aspects of his life.
10(h) Ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, sections Three and Fourteen of the South Carolina Constitution, and section 17-3-20 of the South Carolina Code. Trial counsel's performance was both unreasonable and prejudicial as outlined below. See Strickland, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.
11(h) Trial counsel unreasonably failed to adequately investigate and present during the guilt and penalty phases evidence of Mr. Bixby's mental health and functioning, retain and provide mental health professionals with the information necessary to conduct competent mental health evaluations of Mr. Bixby, and present the effects of Mr. Bixby's deficits on his behavior throughout his life and in and around the time of the crime and arrest.
10(I) Ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, sections Three and Fourteen of the South Carolina Constitution, and section 17-3-20 of the South Carolina Code. Trial counsel's performance was both unreasonable and prejudicial as outlined below. See Strickland, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.
11(I) Trial counsel unreasonably and prejudicially failed to investigate and present [*21]  evidence that would have challenged, rebutted, and more fully explained the testimony of Daniel Bixby and Alana Taylor.
10(j) The bar on the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Article I, section 15 of the South Carolina Constitution, and international law, including international customary law. See, e.g., Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the Death Penalty, ECOSC Resolution 1984/50 (May 15, 1984), U.N. ESCOR Supp. (No. 1) at 33, U.S. Doc. E/1984/84, para. 3 (prohibiting the execution of the insane); The Question of the Death Penalty, Hum. Rts. Comm., 61st Sess., Res. 2005/59 (2005), E/CN 4/2005/135 (condemning the execution of persons suffering from mental illness).
11(j) Mr. Bixby's mental health, cognitive functioning, and brain damage impair his reasoning, judgment, and control of his impulses and, therefore, diminish his moral culpability below that required to impose a sentence of death.
10(k) Ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, sections Three and Fourteen of the South Carolina Constitution, and section 17-3-20 of the South Carolina Code. Trial counsel's performance was both unreasonable and prejudicial as outlined below. See Strickland, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. The defenses of (1) not guilty by reason of insanity [*22]  and (2) guilty but mentally ill are defined by statute. S.C. Code §§ 17-24-10, 17-24-20 (West 2012).
11(k) Trial counsel unreasonably failed to investigate and present Mr. Bixby's mental health, cognitive functioning, and brain damage that rendered him, at the time of the offense, unable to distinguish legal and moral right from wrong and to recognize that his actions were morally or legally wrong as well as rendered him unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.
10(l) The legal basis underlying the other claims in this application are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Cumulative error requires granting Mr. Bixby relief. See, e.g., Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 302-03, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973) (finding that exclusion of critical evidence coupled with inability to cross-examine violated due process by denying a fair trial).
11(l) The facts and allegations set forth in the above claims are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
(Doc. #23-2 at 14-20, App. 5393-99 (formatting altered for ease of reference).)
The PCR court held evidentiary hearings on December 10-13, 2012 and March 21, 2013. (See Doc. #23-7 at 222 to 23-9 at 225, App. 6694-7697.) The parties submitted post-hearing briefing. (See Doc. #23-3 at 172-337, Doc. [*23]  #23-6 at 54-151, App. 5644-809, 6311-6408.) On January 9, 2015, after considering the parties' briefs and evidence presented at the two evidentiary hearings, the PCR court issued its order dismissing Bixby's application.8 (See Doc. #23-7 at 112-183, App. 6584-655.) Bixby moved to alter or amend the PCR court's order and for reconsideration (see Doc. #23-7 at 184-193, App. 6656-65), which the PCR court denied on April 7, 2015 (see Doc. #23-7 at 207-18, App. 6679-90.)

The PCR Appeal
Mr. Mills and Mr. Westbrook continued to represent Bixby on appeal and presented the following questions to the South Carolina Supreme Court in Bixby's petition for a writ of certiorari:
1. Whether the PCR court erred in failing to find trial counsel ineffective for failing to investigate and present lay and documentary evidence, including Mr. Bixby's having been sexually abused, exposed to violence, raised in poverty by a mentally ill mother and abusive, alcoholic father, and his resulting lack of skills to independently cope as an adult. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003).
2. Whether the PCR court erred in failing to find trial counsel's ineffective assistance was prejudicial where they failed to provide Dr. Ruben Gur with the brain imaging [*24]  counsel obtained specifically for Dr. Gur's assessment, and assessment that would have uncovered damage that likely affected Mr. Bixby's ability to control his actions during the offense. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003).
3. Whether the PCR court erred in failing to find trial counsel ineffective for failing to present the expert testimony of Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, who, at the time of trial, was prepared to testify that Mr. Bixby had been sexually abused and was, at baseline, "psychotic," suffering from delusions, ideas of reference, disorganized thinking, and mood lability. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003).
4. Whether the PCR court erred in failing to find trial counsel ineffective for failing to place the tragic shooting in the larger context of Mr. Bixby's social history, which would have explained what made Mr. Bixby uniquely vulnerable to being placed in such a situation. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003).
5. Whether the PCR court erred in failing to find trial counsel ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence that would have significantly mitigated the State's case in aggravation, as presented through the evidence of Daniel Bixby and Alane Taylor. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003).
6. Whether the PCR court erred in failing to hold that Mr. Bixby's mental illness and brain [*25]  damage render him ineligible for the death penalty, both individually and categorically. U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV; S.C. Const. art. I, § 15.
7. Whether the PCR court erred in failing to find trial counsel ineffective for failing to object to the trial court's instruction that jurors could infer malice from the use of a firearm, an objection counsel had raised and ultimately won in a prior case. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979).
8. Whether the PCR court erred in failing to find trial counsel ineffective for failing to recall Mr. Patrick White to testify in the sentencing phase that even a title searcher would not have discovered the right of way in the chain of title, the right of way at issue in the Bixbys' dispute with the Department of Transportation[.] U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003).
9. Whether the PCR court erred in failing to find appellate counsel ineffective for inadequately briefing the application of a procedural bar that prevented this Court from reaching the merits of whether Mr. Bixby had an adequate opportunity to voir dire prospective jurors about their ability to meaningfully consider a sentence of life, where the trial court had prevented counsel for Mr. Bixby from providing an accurate definition of murder for the jurors. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 105 S. Ct. 830, 83 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1985); Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 119 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1992).
10. Whether the PCR court erred in [*26]  holding that the jurors' conclusion that Mr. Bixby's status as a fatal shooter in the guilt phase foreclosed a sentence of life was inadmissible and was not evidence of premature deliberation. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV.
11. Whether the PCR court erred by refusing to allow Mr. Bixby to amend his petition to conform to the evidence, where the amendment would have required neither additional briefing nor evidence. Rule 15(b), SCRCP; see also U.S. Const. amend. XIV.
12. Whether, in a capital case, a judge is required to independently assess the evidence and enter judgment or, whether the judge may copy a party's brief in lieu of drafting the judge's own "specific findings of fact" and his own "conclusions of law relating to each issue." S.C. Code Ann. 17-27-160(D); U.S. Const. amend. XIV.
(Doc. #24-4 at 10-13.)
On March 7, 2017, after full briefing by the parties, the Supreme Court of South Carolina denied Bixby's petition. (See Doc. #24-8.) Remittitur issued on March 23, 2017. (See Doc. #24-9.)
Bixby appealed this decision to the United States Supreme Court through a petition for writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court denied Bixby's petition on October 16, 2017. See Bixby v. South Carolina, 138 S. Ct. 361, 199 L. Ed. 2d 267 (2017).

HABEAS ALLEGATIONS
In order to comply with the statute of limitations, Bixby filed a preliminary petition for writ of habeas corpus [*27]  on March 27, 2018 listing twenty-nine "claims."9 (See Doc. #72.) On April 4, 2018, Bixby filed what he refers to as his "Full Petition" and the undersigned has construed as a memorandum supporting his initial habeas petition, condensing his claims into six primary grounds, two of which have multiple sub-parts. (See Doc. #72-1.) In addition, the undersigned allowed Bixby additional time to supplement his argument in support of Ground Six. (See Supp. Mem., Doc. #80.) Collectively, these three documents constitute the Petition and raise the following grounds for relief, as presented in Bixby's "Full Petition":
I. Bixby's Right to the Effective Assistance of Counsel as Guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution was Violated Due to Trial Counsel's Failure to Adequately Investigate and Prepare to Confront and Rebut state's evidence and present mitigating evidence in the following particulars:
(A) Failure to present by adequate evidence or argument that Bixby was born into an economically and mentally unstable family with a history of violence with the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck.
(B) Failure to present by adequate evidence or argument that Bixby's early childhood was characterized by physical and [*28]  emotional abuse and affected by social ostracism and rural poverty.
(C) Failure to present by adequate evidence or argument that during Bixby's middle childhood, his sister sexually abused him, his mother continued to struggle with her mental health, his teachers recognized Steven's own mental and emotional limitations, his mother and father wielded a gun in a land dispute and used him and his siblings as pawns in that dispute.
(D) Failure to present by adequate evidence or argument that during Bixby's adolescence, his parents removed him from school, forced him to work for his father, and engaged in frivolous litigation, culminating in having their home foreclosed upon and Steven moving across the state, further isolating him from his peers and family. During this period, he lost consciousness when he was hit in the head by a two-by-four.
(E) Failure to present by adequate evidence or argument that as an adult, Bixby's mental and cognitive limitations left him unable to cope with the basic demands of adulthood, including being a competent employee, husband, or father, and he remained enmeshed with his mother.
(F) Failure to present by adequate evidence or argument that Bixby's lifetime [*29]  of abuse and mental and cognitive impairments left him uniquely vulnerable to his parents' using him in their dispute.
(G) Prior to trial, trial counsel failed to obtain social history information and "dropped the ball" on getting Dr. Gur the information he needed.
(H) Trial counsel unreasonably and prejudicially failed to investigate, develop, and present Mr. Bixby's social history through lay witnesses and documentary evidence, including Mr. Bixby's having been sexually abused, exposed to violence, raised in poverty by a mentally ill mother and abusive, alcoholic father, and resulting of [sic] lack of meaningful skills to cope as an adult.
(I) Trial counsel unreasonably and prejudicially failed to place the tragic shooting in the larger context of Mr. Bixby's social history which would have explained what made him uniquely susceptible to being placed in such a situation and probably would have persuaded at least one juror to vote for life.
(J) Trial counsel prejudicially failed to present testimony of Dr. Gur and Dr. Schwartz-Watts and related evidence of Bixby's brain damage and major mental illness.
(K) Trial counsel prejudicially failed to present evidence that would have undermined [*30]  and substantially mitigated the state's case in aggravation.
(L) Bixby's mental illness and brain damage make him ineligible for the death penalty, both individually and categorically.
II. Bixby's Right to the Effective Assistance of Counsel as Guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution was Violated Due to Trial Counsel's Failure to Adequately object to the charge on inferred malice.
(M) Trial counsel unreasonably and prejudicially failed to object to the trial court's instruction that the jurors could infer malice from the use of a firearm, allowing jurors to find Bixby guilty of murder, even if they believed the shooting was justified or excused.
(N) Reasonable counsel would have objected to the jury instruction with problems known to counsel. Trial counsel's failure prejudiced Mr. Bixby because the jury may have convicted him of murder despite believing the shooting was justified or excused.
(O) Instructing the jury on inferred malice violated state and federal law.
III. Bixby's Rights to Due Process and the Effective Assistance of Counsel as Guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were Violated Due to Trial Counsel's Failure to recall Patrick White to testify in the sentencing phase.10
IV. Bixby's Rights to Due Process [*31]  and the Effective Assistance of Counsel as Guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were Violated Due to Appellate Counsel's Failure to Adequately Brief Procedural Bar issues.11
V. Bixby's Rights to Due Process and the Effective Assistance of Counsel as Guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were violated Due to Trial Counsel's Failure: to present evidence and offer argument during the guilt phase to the extent that the jury reached the conclusion that Mr. Bixby was the shooter, to argue that [the] jury was imp[]roperly permitted to engage in premature deliberations, to prevent jury misconduct which tainted the verdict and the sentence; and to adequately argue that the imposition of death is in violation of the United States Constitution.12
VI. Bixby's Rights to Due Process and the Effective Assistance of Counsel as Guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were Violated Due to Trial Counsel's Failure to protect the Petitioner[']s rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et. seq.13
(Doc. #72-1 at 72-75.)

STANDARDS OF REVIEW

Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has brought into question whether there is a genuine dispute for trial on a material element of the non-moving party's claims, the non-moving party bears the burden of coming forward with specific facts which show a genuine dispute for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The non-moving party must come forward with enough evidence, beyond a mere scintilla, upon which the fact finder could reasonably find for it. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The facts and inferences to be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Shealy v. Winston, 929 F.2d 1009, 1011 (4th Cir. 1991). However, the non-moving party may not rely on beliefs, conjecture, speculation, or conclusory allegations to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Baber v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 977 F.2d 872, 874-75 (4th Cir. 1992). The evidence relied on must meet "the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at a trial on the merits." Mitchell v. Data Gen. Corp., 12 F.3d 1310, 1316 (4th Cir. 1993).
To show that a genuine dispute of material fact exists, a party [*35]  may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (Rule 56(e) permits a proper summary judgment motion to be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves). Rather, the party must present evidence supporting his position through "depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with . . . affidavits, if any." Id. at 322.

Habeas Corpus
Because Bixby filed his Petition after the effective date of the AEDPA, the undersigned must consider exhausted claims in his Petition under the deferential standard of review set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), as amended. Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 117 S. Ct. 2059, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1997); Breard v. Pruett, 134 F.3d 615 (4th Cir. 1998). "If an application [for habeas relief] includes a claim that has been 'adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings' [pursuant to] § 2254(d)," Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 181, 131 S. Ct. 1388, 179 L. Ed. 2d 557 (2011), that application:
shall not be granted with respect to [such a] claim . . . unless the adjudication of the claim-
(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or
(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the State court proceeding.
28 U.S.C. §§ 2254(d)(1) & (2); see [*36]  also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 398, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000). This standard is "difficult to meet." Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 102, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2011). To be sure, it is a "highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings, which demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt." Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 181 (citation omitted). The petitioner carries the burden of proof. Id. at 25.
Section 2254(d) is written in the disjunctive and each clause has an independent meaning. Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 694, 122 S. Ct. 1843, 152 L. Ed. 2d 914 (2002). With respect to the two clauses of § 2254(d)(1), a state court determination is "contrary to" clearly established federal law if it "arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the United States Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the United States Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. at 413. Under the second clause of § 2254(d)(1), a state court determination is an "unreasonable application of" clearly established federal law if the state court "identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the United States Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case." Id. "Under § 2254(d)(1)'s 'unreasonable application' clause . . . , a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent [*37]  judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneouslyor incorrectly. Rather, that application must also be unreasonable." Id. at 411. For a federal court to grant habeas relief, the state court's adjudication must be "objectively unreasonable." Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 75-76, 123 S. Ct. 1166, 155 L. Ed. 2d 144 (2003). Moreover, "an 'unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law,' because an incorrect application of federal law is not, in all instances, objectively unreasonable." Humphries v. Ozmint, 397 F.3d 206, 216 (4th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (citing Williams, 529 U.S. at 410).
A federal court's review of a state court decision is "deferential because [the court] cannot grant relief unless the state court's result is legally or factually unreasonable." Bell v. Jarvis, 236 F.3d 149, 163 (4th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (quoting Aycox v. Lytle, 196 F.3d 1174, 1178 (10th Cir. 1999)). Factual findings "made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct," and a petitioner has "the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence." 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).
When reviewing a habeas corpus claim, a federal court must be mindful of the "significant deference" owed to state courts. Bennett v. Stirling, 842 F.3d 319, 323 (4th Cir. 2016). "A state court's determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as 'fairminded jurists could disagree' on the correctness of the state court's [*38]  decision." Harrington, 562 U.S. at 101 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (2004)). The habeas court's "review under § 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits." Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 181.

Exhaustion
A habeas corpus petitioner may obtain relief in federal court only after he has exhausted his state court remedies. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A). "To satisfy the exhaustion requirement, a habeas petitioner must present his claims to the state's highest court." Matthews v. Evatt, 105 F.3d 907, 911 (4th Cir. 1997), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Barnette, 644 F.3d 192 (4th Cir. 2011); see also In re Exhaustion of State Remedies in Criminal and Post-Conviction Relief Cases, 321 S.C. 563, 471 S.E.2d 454, 454 (S.C. 1990) (holding that "when the claim has been presented to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, and relief has been denied, the litigant shall be deemed to have exhausted all available state remedies."). Specifically, "[t]o exhaust a claim, the petitioner must present the state court with "'both the operative facts and the controlling legal principles.'" Gray v. Zook, 806 F.3d 783, 798 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting Winston v. Kelly (Winston I), 592 F.3d 535 555 (4th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 84, 196 L. Ed. 2d 73 (2016), reh'g denied, 137 S. Ct. 459, 196 L. Ed. 2d 337 (2016)).
"Whether a claim has been adjudicated on the merits is a case-specific inquiry," Winston v. Pearson (Winston II), 683 F.3d 489, 496 (4th Cir.2012), and "[a] claim is not 'adjudicated on the merits' when the state court makes its decision 'on a materially incomplete record,'" Gordon v. Braxton, 780 F.3d 196, 202 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting Winston I, 592 F.3d at 555). "A record may be materially incomplete 'when a state court unreasonably refuses to permit "further development of the facts" of a claim.'" [*39]  Id. (quoting Winston II, 683 F.3d at 496). As the Fourth Circuit explained, "[i]f the record ultimately proves to be incomplete, deference to the state court's judgment would be inappropriate because judgment on a materially incomplete record is not an adjudication on the merits for the purposes of § 2254(d)." Winston I, 592 F.3d at 555-56 (citation omitted).
Accordingly, a petitioner must "fairly present[] to the state court both the operative facts and the controlling legal principles associated with each claim." Longworth v. Ozmint, 377 F.3d 437, 448 (4th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). For a claim to be "fairly presented," a petitioner must present evidence in support of the claim to the state court, and the state court must "reach[] a conclusion as to which "'fair-minded jurists could disagree.'" Gray v. Zook, 806 F.3d at 792 (quoting Harrington, 562 U.S. at 101). "[A] federal habeas court may consider only those issues which have been 'fairly presented' to the state courts." Matthews v. Evatt, 105 F.3d at 911 (citations omitted).
In general, a federal habeas court should not review the merits of claims that would be found to be procedurally defaulted (or barred) under independent and adequate state procedural rules. Lawrence v. Branker, 517 F.3d 700, 714 (4th Cir. 2008). Procedural default is an affirmative defense that is waived if not raised by a respondent. Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, 165-66, 116 S. Ct. 2074, 135 L. Ed. 2d 457 (1996).
For a procedurally defaulted claim to be properly considered by a federal habeas [*40]  court, the petitioner must "demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice." Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1991); see also Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1, 8-9, 132 S. Ct. 1309, 182 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2012). As an alternative to showing cause and prejudice, a petitioner may attempt to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice, e.g., actual innocence, Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S. Ct. 1604, 140 L. Ed. 2d 828 (1998), Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S. Ct. 851, 130 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1995), or abandonment by counsel, Maples v. Thomas, 565 U.S. 266, 283, 132 S. Ct. 912, 181 L. Ed. 2d 807 (2012).

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are constitutional in nature and therefore are properly asserted under § 2254. The Sixth Amendment provides: "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence." U.S. Const. amend. VI. "[T]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel exists, and is needed, in order to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial." Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 684, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). The Supreme Court has interpreted the right to counsel as providing a defendant "'the right to the effective assistance of counsel.'" Id. at 686 (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970)). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Bixby must satisfy the rigorous two-prong test established in Strickland. Under the first prong, Bixby "must show that counsel's representation was deficient[,]" and under [*41]  the second prong, he "must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense." Id. at 687.
To establish constitutionally deficient performance under Strickland's first prong, Bixby must demonstrate that his lawyer "made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment." Id. This showing must go beyond establishing that counsel's performance was below average, since "effective representation is not synonymous with errorless representation[.]" Springer v. Collins, 586 F.2d 329, 332 (4th Cir. 1978). When attempting to establish deficient performance, Bixby must overcome a "'strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,' and 'that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.'" United States v. Rangel, 781 F.3d 736, 742 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v. Higgs, 663 F.3d 726, 739 (4th Cir. 2011)). The question whether counsel's performance was deficient may be answered only by viewing counsel's actions or decisions in the light of all surrounding circumstances at the time the decision was made, not in the artificial light of hindsight. See Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 371-72, 113 S. Ct. 838, 122 L. Ed. 2d 180 (1993). The Supreme Court has cautioned that "[e]ven the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way." Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689 (citation omitted). [*42] 
To show deficient performance under Strickland's second prong, Bixby must "affirmatively prove prejudice," which requires him to show "that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome." Id. at 693-694. "However, [a court] cannot grant relief solely because the outcome would have been different absent counsel's deficient performance." Sexton v. French, 163 F.3d 874, 882 (4th Cir. 1998) (citing Fretwell, 506 U.S. at 369-70). Instead, the court "can only grant relief under the second prong of Strickland if the 'result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable.'" Id. (quoting Fretwell, 506 U.S. at 369).
A court applying the Strickland test may apply either prong first and need not analyze both prongs of the test if a petitioner makes "an insufficient showing on one." Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697. Accordingly, "a court need not determine whether counsel's performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies." Id.
A court's evaluation of counsel's performance under the Strickland standard is "highly deferential," and a habeas court is not to "second-guess" the performance. [*43]  Id. at 689. To be sure, "[s]urmounting Strickland's high bar is never an easy task." Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 371, 130 S. Ct. 1473, 176 L. Ed. 2d 284 (2010). The court is mindful that "the standard for judging counsel's representation is a most deferential one." Harrington, 562 U.S. at 105. "Establishing that a state court's application of Strickland was unreasonable under § 2254(d) is all the more difficult. The standards created by Strickland and § 2254(d) are both highly deferential, and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so." Id. (citations omitted); see also Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170 at 190, 131 S. Ct. 1388, 179 L. Ed. 2d 557 (review of state court's decision is "doubly deferential") (citations omitted). As Justice Kennedy cautioned in Harrington:
The Strickland standard is a general one, so the range of reasonable applications is substantial. Federal habeas courts must guard against the danger of equating unreasonableness under Strickland with unreasonableness under § 2254(d). When § 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel's actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland's deferential standard.
562 U.S. at 105.
With these standards in mind, the undersigned turns to Bixby's grounds for habeas relief.

ANALYSIS
For Grounds I through V, rather than draft original arguments under the appropriate § 2254 standard, Bixby's "[c]ounsel [*44]  adopt[ed] by reference the arguments of PCR counsel on this matter." (Doc. #72-1 at 75 (citing App. 5798-806)). The arguments that Bixby's counsel incorporates by reference were made to the PCR court after the PCR evidentiary hearing, but before the PCR court issued its order denying and dismissing Bixby's PCR application. Thus, those arguments necessarily fail to specifically address the primary issue with which this Court is concerned—that is, whether the state court's ruling on this issue is the result of unreasonable factual findings or an unreasonable application of federal law. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). Nonetheless, the undersigned has attempted to apply the § 2254 standards to those arguments and the portions of the PCR order addressing them.14
In addition, this Court must accept as correct any factual determinations made by the state courts, unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e). Bixby has not offered argument or evidence challenging the state courts' factual findings. Accordingly, the undersigned will presume the correctness of those findings throughout this order.

Ground I: Trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective for failing to adequately investigate [*45]  and prepare to confront and rebut the State's evidence and present particular mitigating evidence.
In Ground I, Bixby argues his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to adequately investigate, develop, and present mitigating evidence. (Doc. #72-1 at 72-74.) Specifically, Bixby alleges his trial counsel failed to develop his social history and evidence regarding his mental health and possible brain damage. Bixby raised this ground in his PCR application and the PCR court addressed his claims on the merits. (See Doc. #23-7 at 139-81, App. 6611-53.)15 Bixby also appealed the PCR court's decision on this ground. (See Doc. #24-4 at 10-12.) Thus, Ground I has been properly exhausted.
Like his other exhausted grounds, Bixby's petition incorporates by reference "the arguments and allegations contained in" a portion of his PCR post-hearing brief.16 (See Doc. #72-1 at 73 (incorporating by reference PCR post-hearing brief, App. 5720-93).) Because this ground is exhausted, to obtain relief on Ground I, Bixby must satisfy either the first or the second clause of § 2254(d). With respect to the first clause of § 2254(d), the PCR court correctly identified Strickland and Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003), as the "clearly established Federal law" governing its evaluation [*46]  of trial counsel's performance. (See Doc. #23-7 at 121-24, App. 6593-96.) Applying that precedent, the PCR court found that Bixby had failed to prove either deficient performance or resulting prejudice. (See Doc. #23-7 at 139-81, App. 6611-53.)

A. Social History Investigation and Presentation

Bixby's Argument
Regarding the investigation and presentation of his social history, Bixby claims his trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective for: failing to (1) investigate and develop certain areas of his social history, including sexual abuse, his exposure to violence, that he was raised in poverty by a mentally ill mother and abusive father, and that he lacked meaningful skills to cope as an adult; (2) present the shooting within the context of his social history through expert testimony; and (3) develop social history information that would have mitigated evidence offered by two State witnesses—Alane Taylor and Bixby's brother, Daniel Bixby. (See Doc. #23-3 at 259-305, App. 5731-77.)
As to his first claim, Bixby contends:
The trial team's failure to interview any of Mr. Bixby's paternal half siblings (or anyone else in his paternal family), failure to uncover physical abuse, failure [*47]  to conduct significant mitigation investigation in South Carolina—where he lived for nearly a decade before the crime—and failure to obtain basic social history documents was prejudicially ineffective. Likewise, counsel's failure to present the social history information they had, including Mr. Bixby's having been sexually abused and his teacher's observations that he had substantial mental and emotional problems from an early age, was prejudicially ineffective. Trial counsel had no strategic reason for these failures.
(Doc. #23-3 at 263, App. 5735 (citation omitted)). Bixby specifically asserts his trial counsel failed to obtain: Rita Bixby's medical records, which Bixby contends would have shown evidence of her mental health problems (see Doc. #23-3 at 268, App. 5740); litigation records from Rita and Arthur Bixby's appearances before the New Hampshire courts, which Bixby asserts would have shown that Arthur also took part in the litigation and that both Rita and Arthur lacked respect for the judicial process (see Doc. #23-3 at 269-70, App. 5741); Social Security Administration records, which Bixby alleges would have demonstrated his father's sporadic employment and his family's lack [*48]  of income (see Doc. #23-3 at 270-71, App. 5742-43); and Bixby's optometry records, which Bixby suggests would have lead counsel to discover that his parents neglected to get him treated for a preventable eye condition and that he suffered from black out spells as a teenager (see Doc. #23-3 at 271-72, App. 5743-44.)
In addition, Bixby contends that trial counsel unreasonably and prejudicially failed to present the testimony of a social historian. Bixby argues counsel were "ineffective for failing to present a cohesive explanation of how Mr. Bixby's lifetime of deprivation, impaired parents, sexually and physically abusive childhood, and cognitive and mental impairments uniquely undermined his ability to extricate himself from his parents and led to his participation in the tragic shooting." (Doc. #23-3 at 280-81, App. 5752-53.) Essentially, Bixby asserts that a social history expert could have connected his life circumstances to his commission of the crime in a way that lay and mental health witnesses could not. (See Doc. #23-3 at 285-86, App. 5757-58.) In support, Bixby relies on Council v. State, 380 S.C. 159, 670 S.E.2d 356 (S.C. 2008), stating that in Council, "the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the standard of care in 1996 required [*49]  obtaining the services of a mitigation specialist where counsel is aware of substantial mitigating evidence." (Doc. 23-3 at 281, App. 5753.)
Bixby further claims trial counsel were ineffective for placing Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, a forensic psychiatrist, in a dual role of both psychiatric expert and social historian. (Doc. #23-3 at 286, App. 5758.) At the PCR evidentiary hearing, trial counsel explained that they originally retained Dr. Schwartz-Watts as a forensic psychiatrist, then decided she would also present Bixby's social history at trial. However, after testimony from two other mental health experts, counsel decided not to call Dr. Schwartz-Watts, so she did not testify in either capacity. Bixby contends the decision to assign an expert a dual role contravenes the American Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases ("ABA Guidelines"), which assign counsel a duty to retain "experts who are tailored specifically to the needs of the case, rather than relying on an 'all-purpose' expert who may have insufficient knowledge or experience to testify persuasively." American Bar Association, Guidelines for the Appointment [*50]  and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1061 (2003). Bixby also alleges that, because it resulted from an inadequate investigation, counsels' decision not to call Dr. Schwartz-Watts could not have been a reasonable strategic decision. (See Doc. #23-3 at 287-88, App. 5759-60.)

The Investigation
At the PCR hearing, trial counsel testified that they assembled a team of experts to assist in investigating Bixby's background and social history, including: Drucy Glass, a mitigation specialist; Pete Skidmore, a fact investigator; and Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, a forensic psychiatrist who was ultimately retained to present both psychiatric and social history testimony.
Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified in the March 21, 2013 PCR hearing. Regarding her role in the social history investigation, Dr. Schwartz-Watts indicated that Ms. Glass was in charge of the investigation, but that she would be presenting Bixby's social history at trial. (See Doc. #23-8 at 516, 23-9 at 55, App. 7488, 7527.) Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified that she, Ms. Glass, and Mr. Grose traveled to New Hampshire to meet with many of Bixby's siblings, other family members, a sheriff, and one of Bixby's teachers. (Doc. #23-8 at 515-16, [*51]  App. 7487-88.) Mr. Nettles testified that he also traveled to New Hampshire for the purpose of developing the mitigation case. (Doc. #23-8 at 108, App. 7080.) Mr. Grose testified that he made three trips to New Hampshire. (Doc. #23-8 at 330, App. 7302.)
According to Dr. Schwartz-Watts's report, she conducted thirteen interviews, including a twenty-five hour interview with Rita Bixby, a five hour interview with Arthur Bixby, and over twenty hours of interviews with Bixby. (See Doc. #24-1 at 307, TF022108.17 ) In addition, Dr. Schwartz-Watts attempted three other interviews and reviewed a number of Ms. Glass's interview notes, including notes from Ms. Glass's interview with Chris Bixby, Arthur's oldest child. (Doc. #24-1 at 307-08, TF022108-09.)
Dr. Schwartz-Watts indicated she worked on Bixby's case for sixty-seven hours and "was more prepared for this case than any" she had "ever been prepared for." (Doc. #23-8 at 515, 519, App. 7487, 7491.) However, Dr. Schwartz-Watts had never served as a social historian in any prior case and is not a licensed social worker. (See Doc. #23-9 at 40, App. 7512.)
Mr. Grose testified that the defense team tasked Mr. Skidmore with investigating the facts of [*52]  the crime while Ms. Glass focused more on the sentencing phase and mitigation. (See Doc. #23-8 at 264-65, App. 7236-37.) Counsel never contemplated Ms. Glass would take the stand and Mr. Grose testified that, in general, mitigation investigators should not testify, but should focus solely on the investigation and dissemination of information. (See Doc. #23-8 at 286, App. 7258.)
Ms. Glass did not testify at the PCR evidentiary hearing, but at least two of her reports are contained in the record and were referenced throughout the hearing by various witnesses. These reports were prepared for and provided to trial counsel and Dr. Schwartz-Watts. (See Doc. #23-8 at 326-29, App. 7298-301.) The first report, a detailed chronology spanning from 1925, when Rita's first husband was born, to 2007, is sixty-two pages long and incorporates information Ms. Glass gathered from interviews with family, friends, former teachers, former neighbors, and people who had dealings or land disputes with Rita and Arthur and from a multitude of records, including: divorce records, court records, medical records, town clerk records, police department records, county corrections records, public defender records, [*53]  workman's compensation records, and employment records. (See Doc. #24-3 at 116-78, App. 8584-646.) Ms. Glass's other report is titled "Bixby Narrative," and summarizes important events in Bixby's family from his parents' previous marriages until Rita and Arthur closed on their house in Abbeville. (See Doc. #24-3 at 180-87, App. 8648-55.)18
Regarding the defense team's South Carolina investigation, Ms. Glass's chronology includes employment information for Bixby's time in Abbeville, apparently gleaned from employment records, interviews with Bixby, and a file of records associated with his workman's compensation claim, including letters from Rita, notes about Rita's attempted involvement in the case, and hearing transcripts. (See Doc. #24-3 at 168-77, App. 8636-45.) Ms. Glass also obtained information about this period leading up to the shooting from medical records from multiple sources, including a mental health evaluation and lengthy narrative remarks from an orthopedic clinic reflecting Bixby's mental state at the time of treatment. (See Doc. #24-3 at 168-77, App. 8636-45.) In addition, Mr. Grose testified that, in the beginning of the investigation, he got most of his information [*54]  about Bixby's time in South Carolina from Alane Taylor, Bixby's former girlfriend who knew him well for a number of years. (See Doc. #23-8 at 345-46, App. 7317-18.) PCR testimony also suggests that the defense team interviewed Wendell Rhodes, a pastor at a church in Abbeville that Bixby attended for a time and a witness at the PCR hearing. (See Doc. #23-8 at 348-50, App. 7320-22.)

The Evidence at Trial
During the penalty phase, trial counsel presented three witnesses: Rita, Bixby's mother; Dr. Richard Lesesne Frierson, a forensic psychiatry expert; and Dr. Tora Brawley, a clinical neuropsychologist. (See Doc. #22-2 at 48-22-3 at 76, App. 34-19-548.)
Rita provided some family background about her and Arthur's children from previous marriages, when they ended their previous marriages and when Bixby and his brother, Daniel ("Danny"), were born. (See Doc. #22-2 at 50-52, App. 3421-23.) She described one of the family's property disputes with neighbors in New Hampshire, but painted a much less hostile picture than in other accounts. (See Doc. #22-2 at 53-55, App. 3424-26.) Rita testified that all of her children went to public school, but that when Danny and Bixby were in seventh grade, Danny [*55]  had an altercation with a math teacher and Rita removed both of the boys from school and began to home school them. (See Doc. #22-2 at 55-59, App. 3426-30.) Rita did not believe in the State's curriculum and refused to teach it, despite facing charges and having to go to court over the issue. (See Doc. #22-2 at 59-60, App. 3430-31.) Instead, Rita created her own curriculum, which consisted mostly of studying the Constitution, with special focus on the Fifth Amendment, and applying the language of the Constitution to factual scenarios. (See Doc. #22-2 at 61-63, App. 3432-34.)
Rita also testified that she represented approximately twenty-three other people in court regarding their property disputes. (See Doc. #22-2 at 63, App. 3434.) Rita described one of those cases and how she interpreted and applied the Fifth Amendment, described some of her own views on property rights, and indicated that she shared those views with Danny and Bixby when teaching them about the Fifth Amendment. (See Doc. #22-2 at 63-68, App. 3434-39.) Rita testified that she often took Bixby to court with her as part of his education. (See Doc. #22-2 at 75, App. 3446.)
Rita stated that every person had a God-given right to use force to protect his property from [*56]  someone coming to destroy or take it. (See Doc. #22-2 at 69-71, App. 3440-42.) On the stand, Rita read the following excerpt from a letter she sent a selectman in New Hampshire and stated this letter reflects beliefs she has held for a long time and that she taught to Danny and Bixby:
There are two classes of cases in which a man is exempted from punishment for killing: Namely, self-protection. This is a natural right and I'd like to add God given right. And secondly, the defense of one's household from a thief or robber. When government will not do it for him every man is ordered and bound to protect his own life, liberty, and property at every hazard and expense of life of his assailant. A man is not bound to wait until his life is on the very point of being taken, but any movements towards foul purpose justifies him in the right of self-defense and in slaying an assailant on the spot.
(Doc. #22-2 at 70-71, App. 3441-42.)
On cross-examination, Rita testified that she shared her beliefs with her other children, too. (See Doc. #22-2 at 79, App. 3450.) She described Arthur as being close to all of the children and taking them hunting. (See Doc. #22-2 at 82, App. 3453.) Rita testified about [*57]  Bixby's marriage to Kathy Colby. (See Doc. #22-2 at 83-85, App. 3454-56.) She indicated that Bixby and Kathy were married for about eight or nine years and had three daughters. (See Doc. #22-2 at 83, App. 3454.) Rita liked Kathy and let them place a trailer on land she owned in New Hampshire. (See Doc. #22-2 at 83-84, App. 3454-55.) Rita testified that when Bixby and Kathy separated, sometimes Bixby would stay with her and Arthur and sometimes he would stay in the trailer. (See Doc. #22-2 at 85, App. 3456.) But, Bixby wanted to get away and the family knew some friends in Abbeville, so, in 1994, Bixby moved to South Carolina. (See Doc. #22-2 at 88-89, App. 3459-60.) Rita and Arthur moved down about five years later, but maintained their residence in New Hampshire and split time between the two houses. (See Doc. #22-2 at 86, App. 3457.)
Rita testified regarding Bixby's work history in South Carolina, stating that he worked at a factory for a short time, then as a cook at a restaurant, then at the Village Grill, then at Flexible Technologies, where he injured his back, and then he bought a concession stand. (See Doc. #22-2 at 89-91, App. 3460-62.) Rita insisted she did not force her views [*58]  on her children but taught them to be independent thinkers. (See Doc. #22-2 at 91-92, App. 3462-63.) On redirect, Rita stated that Bixby's beliefs were consistent with hers and that she taught Bixby that he could use violence to defend property. (See Doc. #22-2 at 97-98, App. 3468-69.) On recross, Rita stated that she never forced any beliefs on Bixby, but that he independently chose to believe the views that she taught him. (See Doc. #22-2 at 98, App. 3469.)
Dr. Frierson, while testifying as a mental health expert, also touched on Bixby's upbringing and family life. In conducting his evaluation, Dr. Frierson interviewed Bixby's half sister, Deb Keith, Daniel Bixby, Alane Taylor, and Rita Bixby. (See Doc. #22-2 at 110-112, App. 3481-83.) In addition, Dr. Frierson testified that he reviewed pertinent police reports, incident reports, arrest warrants, indictments, medical records, letters Bixby wrote to Alane Taylor, and letters Rita wrote to Alane Taylor. (See Doc. #22-2 at 109-110, App. 3480-81.) While testifying regarding the etiology of personality disorders, Dr. Frierson described the impact of Bixby's relationship with Rita and his home schooling:
A. . . . We're all born with different [*59]  sort[s] of temperaments and that has a great influence on personality. On top of temperament you have the most important relationship which is the primary caregiver [and] the infant and how those two relay, in this case Rita Bixby and Mr. Bixby. Here were are told that he was his mother's favorite. He describes himself as being closer to his mom than any other of the siblings. And clearly, if you look at the letters and interview Mr. Bixby it's clear that he has a very inmeshed relationship with his mother.
Q. And did the interviews with the siblings confirm that?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And did you have a history about the home schooling?
A. Yes. I mean, he was home schooled from, he says, age 11 or 12. I've also read that it was seventh grade. I'm not exactly sure how old he was. His records were not available to find that out but, yeah, here he was taken out of an environment where you get feedback from other kids. And in some ways kids help other kids learn how to socialize, get social skills. And if you say something that's odd or narcissistic usually other kids are going to let you know about it; you know, why do you think you're so much better than everything else. And so here he was taken [*60]  out of that environment where he could have gotten that feedback on a daily basis in a school with other kids his own age.
(Doc. #22-2 at 116-17, App. 3487-88.)
Regarding Rita's home schooling curriculum, Dr. Frierson testified:
A. . . . There was a great emphasis on the basics: Reading, writing, arithmetic. But there was also, I would say, compared to a normal public school curriculum or normal private school curriculum there was a lot of Government, Constitution, Education, and American History. A big focus on that much more than you will get in most public schools.
Q. And I'm looking at page 14 of your report in the final paragraph. You refer to it as Rita Bixby's forceable [sic] indoctrination of Steven Bixby to the regimen and ideals concerning the Constitution and government at an impressionable age. He was around 11 or 12 when his home schooling began. What do you mean by that statement?
A. Well, first of all, you have to look at several things. Being taken out of school and home schooled at that age, that is an impressionable age. An 11 year old or 12 year old is not mature enough necessarily to independently view what someone's teaching them as whether it's correct or not. Secondly, [*61]  I think he was very susceptible to being indoctrinated because of his IQ, because he has a lower IQ. So he's maybe not as smart as an average 11 or 12 year old to begin with. And then, you know, to have all these principals about the [C]onstitution instilled in him at such a young age I think had a profound impact . . . on his value system, the value system that we develop. You know, you can decide what's right, sense of what's wrong, develops not from early childhood but also on other issues during adolescence.
Q. Okay. And value systems are something we learn when we're children?
A. Part of it is learned, yes.
Q. Okay. And some of it can be learned wrong.
A. Yes.
(Doc. #22-2 at 124-26, App. 3495-97.)
Trial counsel did not call additional social history witnesses, but they did elicit relevant testimony from the State's witnesses.
The State called Daniel Arthur Bixby, Bixby's younger brother by eleven months, who described the Bixby family, including his parents' previous marriages and the children each had from those marriages. (See Doc. #22-1 at 270-77, App. 3242-49.) Daniel testified that he and Bixby grew up in the same house and that "it was a hard childhood." (Doc. #22-1 at 278, App. [*62]  3250.) Daniel indicated that their father, Arthur Bixby, a professional builder, had to spend a lot of time working, so he and Bixby spent most of their time with their mother, Rita. (See Doc. #22-1 at 278-80, App. 3250-52.)
This was especially true after Rita pulled the boys out of school when they were in seventh grade in order to home school them. Daniel testified that after they left school, he and Bixby "had no communication with the outside." (Doc. #22-1 at 284, App. 3256.) According to Daniel, their home school curriculum consisted mostly of memorizing and reciting portions of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. (See Doc. #22-1 at 314-16, App. 3286-88.) Daniel described Rita's strong views about property rights and how that permeated his and Bixby's education and childhood in general. (See Doc. #22-1 at 316-17, App. 3288-89.) He stated that, for Rita, "Without property, you were nothing." (Doc. #22-1 at 317, App. 3289.)
Daniel indicated that Rita's views on property rights lead to several property disputes throughout the time the Bixbys were living in New Hampshire. (See Doc. #22-1 at 294-98, 326-35, App. 3266-70, 3298-307.) Rita would routinely take her property [*63]  disputes to court and she even represented other people in their property disputes. (See Doc. #22-1 at 343-45, App. 3315-17.) Daniel testified that Rita would often bring he and Bixby to court with her as part of their education. (See Doc. #22-1 at 345, App. 3317.)
Daniel stated that Rita favored Bixby and that, in her eyes, Bixby could do no wrong. (See Doc. #22-1 at 281, App. 3253.) Daniel described Bixby as hot tempered, very antagonistic, belligerent, and very set in his ways—"with the same characteristics as [Rita]; it was either his way or the highway." (Doc. #22-1 at 287-88, App. 3259-60.)
While testifying about Bixby's marriage, Daniel called it a "strained relationship" and described a physical altercation where Bixby grabbed his wife and shoved her toward a doorway when she asked for help bringing in their baby's things from the car. (See Doc. #22-1 at 292-93, App. 3264-65.)
Daniel also testified about his siblings. Daniel and Bixby have five siblings from Rita's first marriage. (See Doc. #22-1 at 298, App. 3270.) Dennis, the oldest sibling, was born with a mild intellectual disability and partial physical disabilities on the right side of his body. (See Doc. #22-1 at 299, App. [*64]  3271.) Dennis lived with Rita and Arthur in Abbeville at the time of the incident. (See Doc. #22-1 at 299, App. 3271.) Dennis has lived with Daniel since the shooting. (See Doc. #22-1 at 299-300, App. 3271-72.) Daniel testified that his other maternal siblings—Donna, Dale, and Debra—were working and living in New Hampshire. (See Doc. #22-1 at 300, App. 3272.) Daniel stated that his other brother, Dana, has not had contact with the family in years, but he thought he was now living in California. (See Doc. #22-1 at 300, App. 3272.) Daniel and Bixby also had four siblings from Arthur's first marriage. (See Doc. #22-1 at 303, App. 3275.) However, he stated that they never had much contact with those siblings. (See Doc. #22-1 at 303-04, App. 3275-76.)
On cross-examination, Daniel testified about the circumstances under which each of his siblings moved out of the house. He stated that Donna moved out at age eighteen because Rita did not approve of her fiancé. (See Doc. #22-1 at 305-06, App. 3277-78.) Dale moved out at age seventeen, joined the Marine Corps, and went to Vietnam. (See Doc. #22-1 at 306-07, App. 3278-79.) Daniel said Dale must have "[f]igured Vietnam was safer . . . [t]han [Rita's] [*65]  wrath." (Doc. #22-1 at 307, App. 3279.) Deb moved out at around seventeen or eighteen years old, after having a baby during high school, and married a family friend. (See Doc. #22-1 at 308, App. 3280.) When her first husband died, Deb married his brother. (See Doc. #22-1 at 309, App. 3281.) Rita did not approve of that husband, she and Deb got in a fight, and Deb was "more or less forgotten" by Rita. (See Doc. #22-1 at 309, App. 3281.) Dana moved out right after he turned eighteen. (See Doc. #22-1 at 309, App. 3281.) He had come out as homosexual to the family and, while the rest of the family did not "have problems with that," Rita did. (See Doc. #22-1 at 309-10, App. 3281-82.)
Daniel testified that he and Bixby learned carpentry skills from Arthur. (See Doc. #22-1 at 318-19, App. 3290-91.) Daniel stated that he was much closer to Arthur and that Arthur had always been his hero. (See Doc. #22-1 at 320-21, App. 3292-93.) He testified that Arthur had Alzheimer's Disease at the time of the trial. (See Doc. #22-1 at 321, App. 3293.) Daniel also described fights between Rita and Arthur when he was growing up and described Rita as a "rabid pit bull" who would "chew and chew" on Arthur. ( [*66] See Doc. #22-1 at 322-23, App. 3294-95.) Daniel said Arthur would just listen to Rita and not fight back. (See Doc. #22-1 at 323, App. 3295.)
The State also called Alane Taylor during the penalty phase. During the guilt phase, Ms. Taylor had read a number of letters that Bixby wrote to her from jail in which he expressed his belief that he had not done anything wrong and had not broken any laws and that the shooting was a predestined event ordained by God to expose and clean up the evil in Abbeville. (See Doc. #21-11 at 326-67, App. 2798-839.) During the penalty phase, Ms. Taylor read excerpts from two additional letters from Bixby explaining that Bixby was not afraid to die, that he was unjustly imprisoned for fighting to keep his family free, and that the prisoners ran the jail. (See Doc. #22-2 at 24-27, App. 3395-98.) In addition, Ms. Taylor described an incident in 1998 when Bixby assaulted her outside her home. (See Doc. #22-2 at 27-29, App. 3398-400.) She stated that Bixby was convicted of assault and battery as a result of that incident. (See Doc. #22-2 at 29, App. 3400.)
On cross-examination, Ms. Taylor stated that she and Bixby stayed in contact after the assault and became good [*67]  friends again in 2003. (See Doc. #22-2 at 29-30, App. 3400-01.) She testified that Bixby helped her with projects around her house and had a great relationship with her son. (See Doc. #22-2 at 31-32, App. 3402-03.) Ms. Taylor also indicated that Bixby changed after his mother moved to South Carolina and that when Rita was around, she was "the center of his world." (See Doc. #22-2 at 34, App. 3405.)
In addition to these witnesses, the State presented evidence of Bixby's previous threats against law enforcement officials. (See Doc. #22-1 at 356-80, App. 3328-52.) Further, the State presented moving victim impact testimony from ten of the victims' family members, former co-workers, and friends. (See Doc. #22-1 at 380-22-2 at 22, 22-2 at 36-43, App. 3352-3393, 3407-14.) The State closed its case with a video of a portion of Deputy Wilson's funeral honoring him as a fallen officer. (See Doc. #22-2 at 37, 43, App. 3408, 3414.)

The PCR Hearing
At the first PCR hearing, on December 10-13, 2012, PCR counsel called: Dr. Ruben Gur, an expert in cognitive neuropsychology, neuroimaging, and brain damage; Wendell Rhodes, the Pastor at Friendship Worship Center in Abbeville; Judy Copeland, a woman who [*68]  knew Bixby in Abbeville; Dr. Rebecca Kendig, a licensed clinical social worker with expertise in psychological assessment; Dr. Bhushan Agharkar, an expert in general adult psychiatry and forensic psychiatry; Dr. Richard Frierson; Dr. Marla Domino, a clinical psychology expert; and Mr. Nettles and Mr. Grose. The second PCR hearing, on March 21, 2013, exclusively addressed psychological evidence. Evidence from that hearing and the mental health experts who testified at the first hearing is addressed separately below.
Wendell Rhodes testified that Bixby joined his church in 1997. (See Doc. #23-7 at 394, App. 6866.) Pastor Rhodes stated that he counseled Bixby and that the church helped him with some of his financial needs. (See Doc. #23-7 at 394-95, App. 6866-67.) He described Bixby's thinking as "a little different" but described him as "very positive" during the time he attended the church. (See Doc. #23-7 at 395, App. 6867.) But, Pastor Rhodes said that after Bixby stopped attending church, he became more negative and could not be reasoned with. (See Doc. #23-7 at 395-96, App. 6867-68.) Pastor Rhodes was still in Abbeville at the time of the incident and said everyone was shocked when [*69]  it happened. (See Doc. #23-7 at 396-97, App. 6868-69.) He stated that, if asked, he would have been willing to testify to the same information at Bixby's trial. (See Doc. #23-7 at 397, App. 6869.)
Judy Copeland testified that she met Bixby in a bar around 1992 and that he offered to help her hook up a septic line for free. (See Doc. #23-7 at 401-02, App. 6873-74.) Ms. Copeland said Bixby spent all day digging trenches for the pipes, but he ran the line uphill, so the system backed up into the house. (See Doc. #23-7 at 403-04, 6875-76.) Ms. Copeland also testified that she was shocked that Bixby listed her as part of his "support system" on a mental health document because she had not seen or significantly interacted with him in years. (See Doc. #23-7 at 404-05, App. 6876-77.) Ms. Copeland stated that nobody from Bixby's defense team came to speak with her and that, if asked, she would have been willing to testify to the same information at Bixby's trial. (See Doc. #23-7 at 405-06, App. 6877-78.)
Dr. Rebecca Kendig conducted a psychosocial assessment of Bixby and concluded that he "had a significant number of risk factors present at each point in his developmental life[,] . . . a lack [*70]  of protective factors, which would've minimized the impact of such risk factors[, and] . . . intellectual and cognitive deficits, which further impaired his development." (Doc. #23-7 at 416-17, App. 6888-89.) Dr. Kendig testified that she interviewed sixteen people, including: Terry Edson, Bixby's paternal half sister; Daniel Bixby; Deb Keith; Regis Roy; Nick Kate; Chase and Alane Taylor; Pastor Wendell Rhodes; Bill Savitz, one of Bixby's employers in Abbeville; Rose Myer, one of Bixby's former co-workers in Abbeville; and several doctors who had treated Bixby.19 (See Doc. #23-7 at 418-19, App. 6890-91.)
Regarding Bixby's prenatal and natal period, Dr. Kendig found:
[T]here are several risk factors going on, that there's economic instability in the home.
. . . .
Both Rita and Arthur had limited education, as previously reported. Rita didn't finish her education past the eighth grade. We see mental health problems for Rita, given her long-term treatment for anxiety and nerve problems, and then her treatment after the crimes happened, for, you know, the delusional symptoms and depression, the mental health problems, the schizophrenia diagnosis in Arthur Bixby, the substance abuse history [*71]  and the - - in Arthur and his family, and then Chris and Brad Bixby, Steve's paternal half brothers, that Rita came from a very violent marriage, and that Arthur had been violent and abusive to his [first] wife.
Again, Rita had a difficult pregnancy with Steve in that she was bleeding during her first trimester. And she - - Steve was born with the umbilical cord around his neck, and he weighed 5 pounds, 9 ounces, at birth. And then, the short birth interval is that, you know, she had so many children close together. And at the time of Steve's birth, you know, she had six children at home, ranging in age from about 18 to 11 months old.
(Doc. #23-7 at 445-46, App. 6917-18.) In addition, Dr. Kendig testified Ms. Edson reported that Arthur used to hit his sons and that she was terrified of him. (See Doc. #23-7 at 425, App. 6897.) And Dr. Kendig found that both of Bixby's parents had "mental problems that date[d] back to before [Bixby's] birth and up to the time of their deaths." (Doc. #23-7 at 441, App. 6913.)
Regarding Bixby's early childhood, Dr. Kendig found:
Steve and his family are a socially ostracized family in a rural community, you know, given Rita's behavior in the community and, [*72]  you know, that they were frequently ostracized from others. Steve and his siblings were further - - or cut off from their peers because Rita's rules - - rigid rules included that they were not allowed to have friends over to play.
And we also see that there's inadequate familial response to medical concerns. The strabismus that Steve was born with was not really treated until he was approximately 5 or 6 years old. Steve, you know, was bullied a lot.
He was exposed to the violence that's been described that was perpetrated by both his mother and his father and the violence that happened between the two of them . . . the assembly line in which Rita would beat her children, Arthur's . . . threat with the gun, Arthur's beating of Rita's children, and the discussion of . . . how Rita would beat her children to the floor.
(Doc. #23-7 at 456-57, App. 6928-29.)
Regarding Bixby's middle childhood, approximately age six to age twelve, Dr. Kendig found:
Steve, during this critical developmental period . . . has many risk factors going on, many stressors upon him. He doesn't have a safe haven. Not only is there so much violence in the family home, you know, school is a really hard place for him as [*73]  well, given the teasing and harassment he endures at school.
He's sexually abused by Deb, his maternal half-sister. You know, the half-siblings, some of whom at time provided protection to him and Danny, all leave the chaotic family home life as soon as they can. Steve . . . is bullied and picked on at school. Steve has significant academic and emotional problems in school, making achievement difficult for him, and that, you know, while his teacher tried to make whatever modifications she could, you know, like sending him out in the hallway to cool down when he got upset, there weren't enough resources at the time to address all of his emotional and behavioral problems, and then, that the teachers, you know, were trying to keep this from Rita and Arthur, because if Rita and Arthur got involved, it just made the problems worse, and that, you know, Steve and Danny, you know, [] continue to [be] isolated from their communities and their peers, and that Rita and Arthur force their children to engage in a conflict that they had with neighbors, you know, that Rita tells her children to throw rocks at these neighbors.
(Doc. #23-7 at 468-69, App. 6940-41.)
Regarding Bixby's adolescence, Dr. Kendig [*74]  found:
So what we have here is, you know, the isolation that the family already experiences is significantly increased because what little opportunities that Danny and Steve had for peer socialization for, you know, being outside their family home is taken away because their parents removed them from school. It's further exacerbated by the parents losing their home in Haverhill and having to move to Chichester. Rita and Arthur spent . . . much of this period involved in lots of litigation that cost them significant amounts of money.
Steve doesn't complete high school and has little skills that he can take with him as he begins adulthood. What work he has done is under his father's wing - - you know, under his father's supervision. He's not individuating from his parents. He's not, you know, ready to move on to adulthood.
And he has these head injuries of being thrown from the pickup truck and being hit in the head with a piece of lumber. And this - - you know, we have this pattern of Rita and Arthur involving Steve in their conflicts.
(Doc. #23-7 at 477-78, App. 6949-50.)
And, regarding Bixby's early adulthood, Dr. Kendig found:
Steve . . . struggled to work at low - - low-skilled jobs and [*75]  . . . did not earn much income, that he has problems with social skills and not being able to read the social cues of others, limited adult relationships, he has his attempts at independent living, and that he has this pattern of behavior that repeats itself throughout - - during his adulthood of sustaining an injury, having mental health decompensation with . . . heavy drinking and subsequent police involvement.
(Doc. #23-7 at 497, App. 6969.) Dr. Kendig also discussed Bixby's first marriage, a severe frostbite injury, an arrest for driving under the influence in 1991, several referrals to behavioral health professionals, and suicide notes to Ms. Taylor and his daughters. (See Doc. #23-7 at 479-92, App. 6951-64.) In describing Bixby's fight with Ms. Taylor that resulted in his assault and battery charge, Dr. Kendig indicated that Ms. Taylor hit Bixby with a phone prior to Bixby pushing her and that Bixby subsequently became good friends with the arresting officer, John Smith. (See Doc. #23-7 at 493-94, App. 6965-66.) In addition, Dr. Kendig stated that Rita advised Bixby to move to South Carolina in order to avoid paying child support and extradition for his driving under the influence [*76]  charge. (See Doc. #23-7 at 484, App. 6956.)
Linking her psychosocial assessment to Bixby's actions on the day of the crime, Dr. Kendig stated:
Well, I think that, when looking back at, you know, Steven's life and what we know about him from childhood through adulthood, is that - - we see that his cognitive impairments . . . that had been there since - - from the time he entered school. The enmeshment that he had with his parents . . . made it hard for him to make his own decision. And . . . concurrent with this is that he had a lot of mental health symptoms, like mood lability, paranoia, believing others were conspiring against him, and he was very impulsive.
And so that led him to being vulnerable to being involved in . . . the tragic crime of December 8th, 2003.
(Doc. #23-7 at 498-99, App. 6970-71.)
On cross-examination, Dr. Kendig admitted that much of the information that formed the basis of her assessment overlapped with that obtained during the trial investigation. (See Doc. #23-7 at 505-16, App. 6977-88.) Dr. Kendig further testified that she did not review a number of interview notes and other records contained in trial counsel's files. (See Doc. #23-7 at 511-15, App. 6983-87.) [*77]  However, she maintained that her account painted a much more "developed and nuanced picture" of Bixby's life than that presented at trial. (See Doc. #23-08 at 50-51, App. 7022-23.) Specifically, Dr. Kendig indicated that her assessment had exposed the extent and severity of the abuse inflicted on the children by Rita and Arthur, that Arthur had delusional thought processes and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and that Rita was treated for delusional beliefs. (See Doc. #23-8 at 51, App. 7023.)
When questioned about the discrepancy between her depiction of Arthur and Danny Bixby's penalty phase testimony that Arthur was one of the kindest, nicest men you would ever meet, Dr. Kendig reasoned that Bixby and Danny desired to protect their parents, Arthur could have been loving and also capable of significant violence and abuse, and that trial counsel did not ask focused enough questions to elicit the right information. (See Doc. #23-8 at 51-53, App. 7023-25.)
Dr. Kendig also testified that the medical records indicating Rita's delusional thinking and Arthur's schizophrenia were from 2011, four years after Bixby's trial. (See Doc. #23-8 at 54-57, App. 7026-29.) Further, the South Carolina [*78]  Department of Mental Health evaluated Arthur after his arrest for the same incident and issued a report on July 5, 2006, finding Arthur incompetent to stand trial. Dr. Kendig testified that the report indicated cognitive disorder, delusional disorder, and a prior diagnosis of dementia, but did not mention schizophrenia. (See Doc. #23-8 at 56-57, App. 7028-29.) On redirect, Dr. Kendig described other evidence of Rita and Arthur's mental health issues from trial counsel's records, including their tenacious litigation, expression of paranoid beliefs, and a report to Ms. Glass from Arthur that he never had children with Rita because they were not sexually compatible, but that he had another wife named Mary. (See Doc. #23-8 at 72-74, App. 7044-46.) Dr. Kendig stated that, as a licensed clinical social worker, she would have wanted to follow up on that evidence. (See Doc. #23-8 at 74, App. 7046.)
Dr. Kendig stated that she interviewed Bixby three times and did not find that he was an accurate reporter of history. (See Doc. #23-8 at 29, App. 7001.) She described additional evidence of Bixby's paranoia and bizarre beliefs. (See Doc. #23-8 at 32-35, App. 7004-07.) Dr. Kendig indicated that Bixby [*79]  has never wavered in his belief that he is in the right and has been unjustly incarcerated. (See Doc. #23-8 at 60-63, App. 7032-35.)
Dr. Kendig testified that she tried to contact Donna Hubbard, one of Bixby's sisters, but Ms. Hubbard did not wish to speak with her or to discuss the past. (See Doc. #23-8 at 43-44, App. 7015-16.) Dr. Kendig did interview Bixby's sister Deb Keith, who allegedly sexually assaulted Bixby when they were children. Dr. Kendig testified that she did not ask Ms. Keith about the alleged sexual assault "in part because . . . such discussions are difficult to have." (See Doc. #23-8 at 45-46, App. 7017-18.) However, she stood by her finding that Bixby was sexually assaulted based on his consistent reports to her, other people in his life, and other mental health professionals and her own credibility finding. (See Doc. #23-8 at 64, App. 7036.)

The PCR Court's Analysis
Regarding trial counsel's alleged failures to investigate and develop certain areas of Bixby's social history and to present that social history through expert testimony, the PCR court found that trial counsel were not deficient. (See Doc. #23-7 at 163-67, App. 6635-39.) Rather, noting "there is no mandate [*80]  that background evidence must be presented at trial by a social worker," the PCR court found that trial counsel made reasonable informed decisions about which evidence to present in order to focus the jury on Bixby's mental limitations and indoctrination by his mother, and how to present that evidence, after diligent and proper investigation. (See Doc. #23-7 at 163-69, App. 6635-41.)
Addressing Bixby's assertion that Council required defense counsel to present a social historian at trial, the PCR court found: "Our Supreme Court of South Carolina has never stated a requirement to have a social historian (or social worker, or any mitigation specialist) testify at trial, though the court has indicated, subsequent to the 2007 trial, that a 'social history investigator' with 'qualifi[cations], in terms of social work experience, to evaluate the information to assess Respondent's background' appears to be a reasonable standard for investigation of capital defendant's background in this jurisdiction." (Doc. #23-7 at 166, App. 6638 (quoting Council, 670 S.E.2d at 363).) The PCR court further found that, while the Council standard, recognized in a December 2008 decision, was not applicable at the time of Bixby's trial, [*81]  trial counsel were not deficient under that standard because they "retained and relied upon an experienced mitigation investigator," along with other experts, and also "personally investigated defendant's background (even going to New Hampshire)." (Doc. #23-7 at 167, App. 6639.)
As to Bixby's specific allegation that trial counsel should have discovered and presented evidence of sexual abuse, his exposure to violence, that he was raised in poverty by a mentally ill mother and abusive father, and that he lacked meaningful skills to cope as an adult, the PCR court found:
Dr. Kendig did testify to evidence of possible sexual abuse by Applicant's sister, but such an allegation was known to trial counsel but was not pursued having found, in counsel's term, no "credible evidence" which they could present. Mr. Grose confirmed in his PCR testimony that Ms. Glass had researched the evidence of possible abuse suffered by Applicant's parents in their previous marriages and provided divorce records. Mr. Grose also confirmed that some family declined to speak with defense counsel. As to the new evidence of possible severe poverty, after personal visits to the family home, Mr. Grose testified that [*82]  the poverty evidence may be questionable in that the Bixbys had a "decent-size house" and appeared to have a fairly average standard of living. Applicant relied in PCR on the Bixbys' report of income to the government. The weight given to those reports is slight considering the Bixbys were severely anti-government. Further, the father's possible diagnosis of schizophrenia (which was contested and was not clearly a diagnosis) was reflected on a report generated well after trial. As to the mother's possible prior diagnoses, Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified the possible additional evidence would not change the ultimate diagnosis or opinion for Applicant in light of what the doctor already knew about the mother's "domination" over Applicant, though it may change some of the facts to that diagnosis or "reinforced" the diagnosis.
(Doc. #23-7 at 168-69, App. 6640-41 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).)
In addition, the PCR court found that Bixby could not prove prejudice from any of trial counsel's alleged deficiencies because the "statements and testimony offered by the various witnesses [at the PCR evidentiary hearings] added nothing of significance" and the mitigating evidence did not [*83]  outweigh the aggravating evidence so as to undermine confidence in the outcome of Bixby's trial.20 (See Doc. #23-7 at 171-73, App. 6643-45.)
Regarding Bixby's allegation that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to more fully challenge or explain Daniel Bixby's and Alane Taylor's testimony, the PCR court found that Bixby failed to demonstrate prejudice because the record showed that trial counsel interviewed and investigated both witnesses and conducted a thorough and strategic cross-examination of Daniel Bixby that elicited all of the desired testimony. (See Doc. #23-7 at 174-75, App. 6646-47.) Further, the PCR court found Bixby failed to show prejudice because neither Alane Taylor nor Daniel Bixby testified at the PCR hearing, so the court never had the opportunity to hear what additional testimony they could have offered or to assess their credibility. (See Doc. #23-7 at 175, App. 6647.)

Analysis
Bixby has not specifically challenged any of the PCR court's findings and, after a thorough review of the record, the undersigned cannot find that the PCR court unreasonably applied established Supreme Court precedent or based [*84]  its decision on an unreasonable determination of the facts.
Based on the record, the undersigned finds the PCR court reasonably concluded that trial counsel hired experienced, qualified experts and undertook a reasonable mitigation investigation. The trial record and PCR testimony show that the investigation produced the information Bixby now argues counsel should have presented during the penalty phase. Thus, Bixby's true contention lies in counsels' decision not to present some of that information.
"When counsel focuses on some issues to the exclusion of others, there is a strong presumption that he did so for tactical reasons rather than through sheer neglect." Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U.S. 1, 8, 124 S. Ct. 1, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2003); see also Wilson v. Greene, 155 F.3d 396, 404 (4th Cir. 1998) ("Decisions about what types of evidence to introduce 'are ones of trial strategy, and attorneys have great latitude on where they can focus the jury's attention and what sort of mitigating evidence they can choose not to introduce.'") (quoting Pruett v. Thompson, 996 F.2d 1560, 1571 n.9 (4th Cir. 1993). Here, the PCR court reasonably found that Bixby failed to rebut this presumption and that trial counsel made a tactical decision to focus the jury on Bixby's unique susceptibility and indoctrination.
Equal deference applies to counsels' last-minute decision not to call Dr. [*85]  Schwartz-Watts. At PCR, Mr. Grose testified that, knowing that Dr. Frierson, who was ordered by the court to conduct a mental health evaluation, was going to testify regardless, he and Mr. Nettles decided to call him in order to have some control over how his testimony was presented to the jury. (See Doc. #23-8 at 359-60, App. 7331-32.) Mr. Grose testified that his preference would have been to present Bixby's social history through Dr. Schwartz-Watts, but that, after Dr. Frierson testified, he became concerned about how discrepancies between the two experts' opinions would play to the jury. (See Doc. #23-8 at 357-59, App. 7329-31.) Mr. Grose further indicated that losing Dr. Schwartz-Watts as a social history witness was a result of his strategic decision not to call her in her capacity as a forensic psychiatrist. (See Doc. #23-8 at 377, App. 7349.) Thus, contrary to Bixby's assertion, the PCR court reasonably found that counsel's decision not to present social history evidence through Dr. Schwartz-Watts, was not based on a lack of information, but on a reasonable and fully-informed trial strategy. And "[j]ust as there is no expectation that competent counsel will be a flawless strategist [*86]  or tactician, an attorney may not be faulted for a reasonable miscalculation or lack of foresight." Harrington, 562 U.S. at 110.
Regarding Bixby's claim that trial counsel were ineffective in failing to investigate and present evidence that would have rebutted testimony from Alane Taylor and Daniel Bixby, the undersigned cannot find the PCR court's prejudice finding unreasonable.
However, the PCR court may have misconstrued Bixby's claim.21 Bixby's argument here focuses almost exclusively on trial counsels' failure to rebut Ms. Taylor's testimony about Bixby's 1998 assault charge and Daniel Bixby's testimony recounting witnessing Bixby act aggressively toward his ex-wife and indicating that every other sibling chose to leave home rather than continue exposure to their mother's views. (See Doc. #23-3 at 300-05, App. 5772-77.) Regarding the assault, Bixby asserts that trial counsel should have discovered that Ms. Taylor hit Bixby first, that Bixby and the arresting officer became friends, and that Rita asserted herself into the situation. (See Doc. #23-3 at 301-02, App. 5773-74.) Also, Bixby argues his trial counsel should have found out from Daniel Bixby that Daniel "pummeled" Bixby after he witnessed him being physical [*87]  with his ex-wife, Daniel believed Bixby's aggressiveness was connected to the physical abuse they experienced as children, and that the boys grew up in economic hardship. (See Doc. #23-3 at 302-03, App. 5774-75.) However, at no point did PCR counsel question trial counsel specifically regarding their investigation of this information.
Further, as the PCR court found and the record demonstrates, trial counsel interviewed both Ms. Taylor and Daniel Bixby and thoroughly cross-examined both witnesses. At trial, Daniel Bixby testified that he had spoken with the defense team at least three times. (See Doc. #22-1 at 337, App. 3309.) At the PCR evidentiary hearing, Mr. Grose testified that he "had several telephone conversations with Alane Taylor very early on" and that he believed Ms. Glass met with Ms. Taylor in person. (Doc. #23-8 at 364-66, App. 7336-38.) When asked about Ms. Taylor's statement, submitted as an exhibit at the PCR hearing, Mr. Grose admitted he had not fully reviewed it, but agreed that if it contained information "that provides some context about her relationship with Bixby, that - - that provides some insight into Mr. Bixby's functioning, and some insight into Mr. [*88]  Bixby's place in the community," that was information he would have liked to present at trial. (Doc. #23-8 at 279-80, App. 7251-52.)
Mr. Nettles testified that the defense team was aware that Ms. Taylor had "a lot of letters," and indicated there was a question regarding whether she would testify. (Doc. #23-8 at 122-23, App. 7094-95.) He also testified that he personally went to New Hampshire to interview Daniel Bixby and ultimately decided that he would not make a good defense witness because he "said things that were not helpful" to the defense. (Doc. #23-8 at 124-25, App. 7096-97.) However, Mr. Nettles agreed that, through interviews with Daniel and cross-examination, he was able to develop an "understanding of the type of influence that [Daniel's] parents had and the type of living environment that Mr. Bixby was in." (Doc. #23-8 at 124, App. 7096.)
In addition, trial counsel had continued contact with Bixby, who would have known all of this information. Thus, the PCR court reasonably found Bixby had not shown that counsel should have done more. See United States v. Mason, 774 F.3d 824, 830 (4th Cir. 2014) ("Attorneys can be selective and strategic without risking an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. . . . Attorneys exist to exercise [*89]  professional judgment, which often involves setting priorities. Indeed, it can be positively detrimental to a client's chances not to set priorities but rather to scattershot the case by raising every objection at trial and pressing every imaginable contention on appeal.") (citations omitted); see also DeCastro v. Branker, 642 F.3d 442, 456 (4th Cir. 2011) ("[T]he state court did not act unreasonably in refusing Petitioner's attempt to upend his conviction and sentence based on the information that he failed to timely provide to counsel.").
As to prejudice, the PCR court's uncontested finding that "The majority of evidence presented in PCR simply expanded on the background already known to counsel" applies with equal weight to this portion of Ground I. (See Doc. #23-7 at 171-72, App. 6643-44.) As does the PCR court's finding that, given the aggravating evidence of "a well-documented, well announced, intentional and organized plan to shoot and kill law enforcement officers who would attempt to come onto the Bixby property," Bixby had failed to "show that the expanded mitigation search discovered any mitigation evidence that would" have supported a more successful mitigation theory than "the explanation of indoctrination and limited mental [*90]  abilities presented at trial." (See Doc. #23-7 at 172-73, App. 6644-45.)
Further, because neither Daniel Bixby nor Alane Taylor testified at the PCR evidentiary hearing, the PCR court was unable to assess their credibility or the potential impact on the jury of the additional information. Accordingly, the PCR court reasonably found that Bixby failed to show prejudice where the court was unable to properly weigh all of the evidence and the evidence it could weigh tilted heavily in the State's favor. See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 41, 130 S. Ct. 447, 175 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2009) (to demonstrate prejudice, the petitioner "must show that but for counsel's deficiency, there is a reasonable probability he would have received a different sentence. To assess that probability, we consider 'the totality of the available mitigation evidence—both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding'—and 'reweig[h] it against the evidence in aggravation.'") (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 397-98, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000)).
For the foregoing reasons, after a full review of the record and the parties' arguments, and granting the appropriate deference to the state court, the undersigned cannot find that the PCR court unreasonably applied established Supreme Court precedent or based its conclusions on an unreasonable [*91]  determination of the facts in this portion of its analysis of Ground I.

B. Mental Health Investigation and Presentation

Bixby's Argument
Bixby contends that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to present evidence of brain damage and major mental illness. (See Doc. #23-3 at 288, App. 5760.) This claim centers around trial counsel's decision not to call Dr. Schwartz-Watts, who diagnosed a major mental illness, and failure to provide Dr. Ruben Gur, who found evidence of possible brain damage, with necessary brain imaging. Regarding counsel's decision not to call Dr. Schwartz-Watts, Bixby asserts trial counsel were ineffective for choosing to present Dr. Frierson, who diagnosed a personality disorder, instead of Dr. Schwartz-Watt's evidence of an Axis I mental illness. (See Doc. #23-3 at 297, App. 5769.) Bixby further alleges that trial counsel's decision was unreasonable because it was based on an inadequate investigation.22 (See Doc. #23-3 at 298, App. 5770.) In addition, Bixby contends Dr. Gur had evidence of brain damage that was consistent with Dr. Brawley's findings, but more persuasive, specific, and significant. (See Doc. #23-3 at 291, App. 5763.)
Bixby further argues that he is ineligible for the death penalty, both individually and categorically, because of his mental illness and brain damage. (See Doc. #23-3 at 305-16, App. 5777-88.)

The Evidence at Trial
During the penalty phase, trial counsel called Dr. Richard Frierson, a court-appointed forensic psychiatrist who had conducted an independent evaluation through the department of mental health ("DMH"), and Dr. Tora Brawley, a clinical neuropsychologist. (See Doc. #22-2 at 105-22-3 at 75, App. 3476-547.)
Dr. Frierson testified that he and the DMH did not normally conduct penalty phase evaluations and that his assessment of Bixby began as a competency evaluation. (See Doc. #22-2 at 108-11, App. 3479-82.) Dr. Frierson diagnosed Bixby with narcissistic personality disorder [*93]  with paranoid and schizo-typal traits and a history of alcohol abuse. (See Doc. #22-2 at 112, App. 3483.) He described the criteria he considered for his diagnosis and evidence that Bixby met that criteria, including Bixby's lack of empathy, pervasive distrust of others, perceptual distortions, and magical thinking. (See Doc. #22-2 at 113-20, App. 3484-91.)
Dr. Frierson then discussed the tests he and his team administered and Bixby's results. He testified that Bixby's Personality Assessment Inventory was "pretty clean" and that Bixby's "personality pathology didn't show up" on that test. (See Doc. #22-2 at 120-21, App. 3491-92.) Dr. Frierson stated that Bixby's full-scale IQ was 84, with a verbal IQ of 88 and a performance IQ of 80. (See Doc. #22-2 at 112, App. 3492.) He indicated that Bixby's scores placed him in the very low average to borderline range of intellectual functioning. (See Doc. #22-2 at 112, App. 3492.) Dr. Frierson specifically noted that Bixby was "not mentally retarded," but that his intellectual functioning was "certainly much lower than the average person." (See Doc. #22-2 at 121, App. 3492.)
Dr. Frierson testified that Bixby's results on the Repeatable Battery for [*94]  Assessment of Neuropsychological Status ("R-BANDS") indicated: an extremely low range of immediate memory, borderline visual spatial construction, borderline dis-language ability, low average ability to focus and retain both oral and visual material, and low average delayed memory. (See Doc. #22-2 at 122, App. 3493.) Dr. Frierson found these results consistent with Bixby's IQ score. (See Doc. #22-2 at 121-23, App. 3492-94.) He stated he did not see a history of significant head injury, but did see evidence of a frost bite injury, back injury, and viral meningitis. (See Doc. #22-2 at 123-24, App. 3494-95.)
Dr. Frierson found that, at the time of the crime, based on his personality traits and the system of beliefs he had been taught, Bixby had an impaired ability to appreciate the criminality of his actions because, in his reality, he did nothing wrong. (See Doc. #22-2 at 126-27, App. 3497-98.)
On cross-examination, Dr. Frierson was asked to describe the standards for not guilty by reason of insanity and guilty but mentally ill. (See Doc. #22-2 at 128-22-3 at 30, App. 3499-502.) Dr. Frierson opined that Bixby did not meet either standard and did not have a mental illness that prevented [*95]  him from knowing right from wrong or from conforming his conduct to the law, despite his distorted view of reality. (See Doc. #22-3 at 30-32, App. 3502-04.) In addition, Dr. Frierson found that Bixby's belief system was not a mental illness and would not keep him from knowing what the law was. (See Doc. #22-3 at 32, 37, App. 3504, 3509.)
Dr. Frierson testified that he considered and specifically rejected diagnoses of paranoid personality disorder and major mental illness. (See Doc. #22-3 at 33-38, App. 3505-10.) He stated that a major mental illness tended to be much more impairing than a personality disorder and listed the reasons he did not believe Bixby had a major mental illness, including: Bixby's lack of history of treatment for a major mental illness, lack of hospitalization for mental illness, denial of hallucinations, lack of delusions, and lack of reports from family members that he suffered from a mental illness. (See Doc. #22-3 at34-36, App. 3506-08.) Specifically regarding delusions, Dr. Frierson found that nothing in Bixby's belief system was delusional because those beliefs are shared by other people. (See Doc. #22-3 at 36, App. 3508.) Dr. Frierson testified that he considered [*96]  a diagnosis of schizo-affective disorder, but found Bixby functioned at a much higher level than he would expect of someone with that diagnosis. (See Doc. #22-3 at 36-37, App. 3508-09.)
Dr. Frierson testified that his team did not conduct any neuropsychological testing, but that they did not find evidence of a cognitive impairment in the testing they did perform. (See Doc. #22-3 at 38, App. 3510.) Dr. Frierson indicated that the R-BANDS, which looks for areas of cognitive impairment, is considered cognitive testing, but not a full neuropsychological exam, and is not as comprehensive as an IQ test. (See Doc. #22-3 at 39, App. 3511.) In his opinion, the R-BANDS results were consistent with Bixby's IQ test and indicated a below average ability, but not the type of cognitive deficit that would impair his ability to know right from wrong. (See Doc. #22-3 at 39-40, App. 3511-12.)
Dr. Brawley was retained by the defense team and performed a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. (See Doc. #22-3 at 56-57, App. 3528-29.) Dr. Brawley found Bixby had a full scale IQ of 84, with a verbal IQ of 89 and a performance IQ of 80. (See Doc. #22-3 at 58, App. 3530.) She indicated Bixby's scores placed [*97]  him in the low, low average range of intellectual functioning, right above borderline. (See Doc. #22-3 at 58, App. 3530.) Dr. Brawley stated that Bixby's results on the Picture Arrangement Subtest were especially low, suggesting he struggled significantly with sequencing, a skill that implicates the frontal lobe. (See Doc. #22-3 at 59, App. 3531.) Dr. Brawley testified that she found other evidence of frontal lobe impairment, including severely impaired verbal learning ability, controlled verbal fluency, and motor testing. (See Doc. #22-3 at 60-61, App. 3532-33.) She described the R-BANDS test and stated that it took about thirty minutes to complete, whereas her battery of tests took several hours and were more in depth. (See Doc. #22-3 at 62, App. 3534.)
On cross-examination, Dr. Brawley stated that she reviewed the DMH R-BAND and personality assessment inventory after conducting her own testing. (See Doc. #22-3 at 64-65, App. 3536-37.) She indicated that she scored Bixby's results assuming the equivalent of a twelfth grade education, but that, even if she lowered that education level, his scores were far below where she would expect given his IQ and indicated deficits, not just weaknesses. [*98]  (See Doc. #22-3 at 68-69, App. 3540-41.) Dr. Brawley stated that Bixby did score well in some areas, including arithmetic, vocabulary, and visual memory and testified that the areas in which he did not score well mostly involved frontal lobe function. (See Doc. #22-3 at 69-72, App. 3541-44.) She stated she was not aware of any link between frontal lobe impairment and personality disorders. (See Doc. #22-3 at 72-73, App. 3544-45.)
On redirect, Dr. Brawley reiterated that her tests implicated multiple deficits, but that the frontal lobe deficit was pervasive throughout. (See Doc. #22-3 at 74, App. 3546.)

The PCR Hearing
In the first PCR hearing, PCR counsel called Dr. Gur; Dr. Bhushan Agharkar, an expert in general adult psychiatry and forensic psychiatry; Dr. Frierson; and Dr. Domino, an expert in clinical psychology. (See Doc. #23-7 at 238-391, 23-8 at 134-217, 394-497, App. 6710-863, 7106-89, 7366-469.) During the second PCR hearing, the PCR court heard from Dr. Schwartz-Watts and Dr. Gur, along with neurologist, Dr. Helen Mayberg. (See Doc. #23-8 at 505-23-9 at 224, App. 7477-696.)
The PCR court qualified Dr. Gur as an expert in cognitive neuropsychology, neuroimaging, and brain damage. [*99]  (See Doc. #23-7 at 246, App. 6718.) Dr. Gur indicated that he reviewed Bixby's neuropsychological testing, available medical records, narratives about Bixby's history, imaging studies, and statements from Bixby's teachers. (See Doc. #23-7 at 246-47, App. 6718-19.) Based on his review, Dr. Gur concluded that Bixby suffered from brain damage and schizophrenia.23 (See Doc. #23-7 at 248, App. 6720.) He described the brain's chemistry and anatomy; the history of neuropsychology; the concept of a bell curve; the difference between standard deviation, statistically significant, and clinically significant; and the characteristics associated with temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and frontal lobe damage. (See Doc. #23-7 at 249-88, App. 6721-60.)
Dr. Gur then explained how he and several other neuropsychologists developed an algorithm to objectively score an individual's performance on a battery of neuropsychological tests. (See Doc. #23-7 at 287-88, App. 6759-60.) Dr. Gur posited that by plugging in the individual's scores, he could develop a "behavioral image," identifying the area of the brain experiencing a deficit. (See Doc. #23-7 at 287-88, App. 6759-60.) Applying this algorithm to Dr. [*100]  Brawley's neuropsychological testing, Dr. Gur found that Bixby's behavioral image suggested a severe head injury, particularly to the right-temporal-parietal area. (See Doc. #23-7 at 289, 292, App. 6761, 6764.) Dr. Gur testified that this type of deficit could result in functional impairments, such as difficulties in memory, spatial memory, and executive frontal-lobe functions, and that, based on the test results, he would have expected to find more damage. (See Doc. #23-7 at 292-93, App. 6764-65.)
Using volumetric analysis, Dr. Gur analyzed an MRI of Bixby's brain from 2012 and found that Bixby had a larger-than-normal brain, some troubling differences between the left and right hemispheres, and large ventricles. (See Doc. #23-7 at 299-303, App. 6771-75.) Dr. Gur noted that the areas in which he observed abnormalities were important for regulating behavior, especially during stressful and emotional situations, and for adequate executive functioning, and that damage to those areas could result in uncharacteristic risk-taking behavior. (See Doc. #23-7 at 303-04, App. 6775-76.)
Applying similar methodology, Dr. Gur also analyzed a PET scan of Bixby's brain from 2006. (See Doc. #23-7 at [*101]  311, App. 6783.) Based on this analysis, Dr. Gur reported a vastly reduced metabolic rate in the hippocampus that was almost seven standard deviations below normal and a reduced metabolic rate in the amygdala that was three standard deviations below normal. (See Doc. #23-7 at 314-15, App. 6786-87.) Dr. Gur also observed an increased metabolic rate throughout the entire frontal and parietal areas and some of the occipital cortex. (See Doc. #23-7 at 315, App. 6787.) He testified that these findings mean when Bixby was faced with a challenge, the activity levels in those areas would flip and the amygdala and hippocampus would become hyperactive and the frontal cortical thinking brain would become hypoactive. (See Doc. #23-7 at 316, App. 6788.) Thus, "if, for whatever reason, [Bixby's] amygdala perceive[d] that it [was] under threat, it [would] very quickly fire up" and "the thinking part of the brain [would] become hypoactive," potentially leading to "bad consequences." (Doc. #23-7 at 316, App. 6788.) Dr. Gur noted that these results were "quite remarkably consistent" with the behavioral image and the MRI results. (See Doc. #23-7 at 317, App. 6789.)
Regarding his interactions with trial [*102]  counsel, Dr. Gur testified that, in August 2006, Mr. Nettles's office requested he review Bixby's MRI, PET, and other brain imaging, and that he agreed and requested copies of the images. (See Doc. #23-7 at 321, App. 6793.) However, Dr. Gur did not receive the materials and, in February 2007, he received an email from Mr. Grose indicating the defense team had not yet sent Dr. Brawley's reports to Dr. Gur. (See Doc. #23-7 at 323-24, App. 6795-96.) Dr. Gur stated that had he received the necessary materials when trial counsel had first contacted him, he could have provided the same testimony at trial that he did in the PCR evidentiary hearing. (See Doc. #23-7 at 325-26, App. 6797-98.)
Based on all of the information, Dr. Gur concluded, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that Bixby suffered from brain damage and schizophrenia that substantially impaired his thought process and ability to understand and interpret the world around him, to control and understand his emotions, and to control his impulses, in such a way that made it difficult to function normally. (See Doc. #23-7 at 327-28, App. 6799-800.)
On cross-examination, Dr. Gur stated that the MRI he analyzed was performed [*103]  in 2012, the PET scan was done in 2006, and that he interviewed Bixby in 2012. (See Doc. #23-7 at 329, 369, App. 6801, 6841.) He described his methodology for analyzing the MRI again, explaining that the "average brain" used for comparison is created from a database of images of healthy brains from volunteer study participants. (See Doc. #23-7 at 334-37, App. 6806-09.) Dr. Gur stated that the particular database he used in this case consisted of forty-one men of comparable age to Bixby. (See Doc. #23-7 at 337, 340, App. 6809, 6812.)
Dr. Gur testified that he is a licensed psychologist, not a medical doctor or a radiologist. (See Doc. #23-7 at 345, App. 6817.) He later clarified, particularly regarding his suggestion that Bixby suffers from schizophrenia, he was not offering a psychiatric diagnosis, even though he was qualified to do so and believed his research supported the conclusion. (See Doc. #23-7 at 366-67, App. 6838-39.) Dr. Gur stated that he did not offer a specific diagnosis in his report, but left that to the psychiatrist. (See Doc. #23-7 at 366, App. 6838.)
Dr. Gur indicated that he employed a world-renowned nuclear-medicine physician to read Bixby's PET scan and issue a [*104]  report. (See Doc. #23-7 at 346-47, App. 6818-19.) When confronted with the information that a radiologist had reviewed the same PET scan and found a negative study, Dr. Gur explained that, in the case of diffuse damage, like Bixby's, often the clinical reading is normal, but when you apply volumetric analysis, "you can document quite extensive brain damage that a neuroradiologist would not be able to . . . see with their bare eyes." (See Doc. #23-7 at 346-48, App. 6818-20.)
When questioned about a radiology report based on a CT scan taken the day after the shooting finding normal ventricle size and CSF spaces, Dr. Gur stated that CT scans "would not be the imaging methodology to use to detect atrophy" and that "[y]ou wouldn't see it with CT, even if it was there." (See Doc. #23-7 at 370-71, App. 6842-43.) When questioned regarding a radiology report based on an MRI taken in 1994 finding a negative study, Dr. Gur testified that the discrepancy may be due to a difference in standards, settings, machines, and methodology, all of which had changed since the early 1990s. (See Doc. #23-7 at 371-75, App. 6843-47.) Dr. Gur later agreed that it would have been helpful to review the 2003 CT scan [*105]  and 1994 MRI as points of reference for Bixby's brain at the time of the incident. (See Doc. #23-7 at 385, App. 6857.) However, partially due to his understanding that Bixby had not had any major head injury since his incarceration, Dr. Gur opined that what he saw on Bixby's MRI and PET scan would be "pretty close" to the way Bixby's brain was in 2003. (See Doc. #23-7 at 381, App. 6853.)
Dr. Gur testified that he reviewed Dr. Brawley's test results and agreed with her assessment of frontal lobe damage. (See Doc. #23-7 at 343-44, App. 6815-16.) He agreed that Dr. Brawley used standard, uniformly accepted tests in her analysis. (See Doc. #23-7 at 353-54, App. 6825-26.) Dr. Gur also agreed that Dr. Brawley had adhered to advice Dr. Gur wrote in a text book suggesting that, in order to link brain dysfunction and behavior, the neuropsychological assessment should be reviewed by a psychiatrist, in this case, Dr. Schwartz-Watts. (See Doc. #23-7 at 364-65, App. 6836-37.) On redirect, Dr. Gur explained that while he agreed with Dr. Brawley's findings, he found additional areas of concern—the temporal and parietal regions and the amygdala—and conducted an additional functional assessment to further [*106]  assess those areas. (See Doc. #23-7 at 386-87, App. 6858-59.)
On redirect, Dr. Gur also stated that his methods are "fairly standard now." (See Doc. #23-7 at 388, App. 6860.) Dr. Gur testified that, based on his clinical assessment of Bixby, his neuropsychological testing, and his review of the brain imaging, that he was sure Bixby had brain damage. (See Doc. #23-7 at 389, App. 6861.)
Dr. Agharkar, an expert in general adult psychiatry and forensic psychiatry, opined that Bixby suffered from symptoms of severe mental illness, critically, psychotic mental illness, and organic brain damage. (See Doc. #23-8 at 137-38, App. 7109-10.) Dr. Agharkar reviewed Arthur's medical records from 2011 and testified that Arthur had been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and a cognitive disorder, and treated with an antipsychotic medication for his delusional beliefs. (See Doc. #23-8 at 139, App. 7111.) In addition, Dr. Agharkar noted that Arthur had been referred to a neurologist, who found Arthur did not have dementia. (See Doc. #23-8 at 139-40, App. 7111-12.) Dr. Agharkar testified that a mental health screening tool administered to Rita in 2011 indicated that Rita suffered from delusions. (See Doc. [*107]  #23-8 at 140-41, App. 7112-13.) He stated that Rita's medical records through her middle adulthood reflected various complaints of anxieties. (See Doc. #23-8 at 141-42, App. 7113-14.) He noted the relevance of Arthur's diagnosis, in particular, because schizophrenia is an inherited condition and having a first-degree relative with the condition increased Bixby's chances of having it by ten percent. (See Doc. #23-8 at 165, App. 7137.)
Dr. Agharkar interviewed Bixby twice and found no evidence that he was malingering. (See Doc. #23-8 at 142-43, App. 7114-15.) Based on his own cognitive screening, Dr. Agharkar stated he would expect to find impairment in Bixby's frontal and temporal lobes. (See Doc. #23-8 at 144-46, App. 7116-18.) He stated that Dr. Gur's findings confirmed his suspicions and expounded on them in a more definitive manner. (See Doc. #23-8 at 148, App. 7120.)
While he was not asked to make a diagnosis, Dr. Agharkar testified that he observed many symptoms of mental illness in Bixby, including his "profoundly delusional thinking." (See Doc. #23-8 at 148-51, App. 7121-23.) Dr. Agharkar stated he saw examples of similar symptoms throughout Dr. Frierson's report. (See Doc. #23-8 [*108]  at 151-52, App. 7123-24.) But, unlike Dr. Frierson, Dr. Agharkar testified that Bixby suffered from delusions, not just odd beliefs, and that his delusions were a sign of mental illness. (See Doc. #23-8 at 153-54, 159-62, App. 7125-26, 7131-34.) He further stated that Bixby's delusions were consistent with Dr. Schwartz-Watts's diagnosis of psychoaffetive disorder and Dr. Gur's findings. (See Doc. #23-8 at 154, 163, App. 7126, 7135.) In addition, Dr. Agharkar testified that his other observations of Bixby were also consistent with Dr. Schwartz-Watts's diagnosis, including Bixby's psychotic thinking, disorganized thoughts, mood lability, depression, and manic-type symptoms. (See Doc. #23-8 at 168, App. 7140.)
Dr. Agharkar concluded that Bixby suffered from a mental disease or defect at the time of the crime based on his reports of "very unusual perceptual disturbances at the time of the incident." (See Doc. #23-8 at 170, App. 7142.) In addition, he expressed serious concerns that Bixby may have lacked sufficient capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law at the time of the incident because of his psychotic mental illness. (See Doc. #23-8 at 171, App. 7143.) He stated [*109]  that Bixby would have been acting under his paranoid belief system and effects of his brain impairment, both of which could have impaired his judgment. (See Doc. 23-8 at 171-72, App. 7143-44.)
On cross-examination, Dr. Agharkar stated that some of the traits he observed in Bixby would fit into Dr. Frierson's diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. (See Doc. #23-8 at 174, App. 7146.) He further testified that he found Dr. Schwartz-Watts's diagnosis reasonable, but disagreed with her assessment that Bixby was not suffering any acute symptoms of schizoaffective disorder at the time of the crime. (See Doc. #23-8 at 174, App. 7146.)
Dr. Agharkar agreed that indoctrination by his family would have contributed to Bixby's belief system, but noted several times that Bixby seemed to take his beliefs further than his family or others. (See Doc. #23-8 at 177-78, 192, 213-14, App. 7149-50, 7164, 7185-86.)
Regarding Dr. Gur's methods and volumetric analysis specifically, Dr. Agharkar testified that he had not used volumetric analysis in his own practice, but that it was something he would consider under the right circumstances. (See Doc. #23-8 at 186, App. 7158.) He stated he had seen volumetric [*110]  analysis used quite commonly in literature and that just because it maybe was not used as often clinically did not mean it was wrong. (See Doc. #23-8 at 186, App. 7158.) Dr. Agharkar's opinion was unaltered by information that a radiologist reviewed the same scan and found it within the normal range. (See Doc. #23-8 at 189, App. 7161.) Rather, he indicated that Dr. Gur's analysis was deeper than a radiologist's would be and that all of the neuropsychological testing, which is functional testing, performed on Bixby, including by Dr. Domino, Dr. Brawley, and Dr. Gur, showed functional impairment. (See Doc. #23-8 at 189, App. 7161.)
On redirect, Dr. Agharkar reiterated that Dr. Gur's testing was far more extensive than that performed by a radiologist and that Dr. Gur would have been able to detect atrophy, especially diffuse atrophy, where radiologists may not have been able to. (See Doc. #23-8 at 212-13, App. 7184-85.) He again stated that his analysis showed dysfunction and signs and symptoms of psychotic mental illness. (See Doc. #23-8 at 214, App. 7186.)
Dr. Frierson, the DMH forensic psychiatrist who testified during the penalty phase, stated the trial court had requested that he "address [*111]  the issue of the defendant's mental health, mental condition, or any mental illness as might affect his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law and whether such capacity was substantially impaired at the time of the alleged offense." (Doc. #23-8 at 401-02, App. 7373-74.) After reviewing sixty-one records and interviewing Bixby for over seventeen hours, Dr. Frierson diagnosed alcohol abuse and narcissistic personality disorder with schizotypal and paranoid traits. (See Doc. #23-8 at 403, App. 7375.)
Dr. Frierson stated that Dr. Gur's findings and conclusions had no impact on his professional opinion in this case. (See Doc. #23-8 at 407, App. 7379.) He indicated that standard psychiatric practice would not call for any neuroimaging unless clinically indicated, he would expect a radiologist to read the scan and issue a report, and, if the radiologist found the scan normal, he would accept that finding. (See Doc. #23-8 at 406-09, App. 7378-81.)
Dr. Frierson stated Bixby was cooperative throughout his interviews, did not become agitated, was able to communicate his ideas clearly, and did not report any auditory or visual [*112]  hallucinations. (See Doc. #23-8 at 410, App. 7382.)
He explained that he did not view Bixby's beliefs as delusional because they were not unique to Bixby—they were shared by his whole family and a segment of society. (See Doc. #23-8 at 415, App. 7387.) Dr. Frierson stated that Bixby, because of his narcissism, holds his beliefs strongly, and that can make them appear fixed and false. (See Doc. #23-8 at 415, App. 7387.) In addition, Dr. Frierson explained that he did not believe Bixby suffered from a mental illness because his idiosyncracies, like his fascination with numbers, began in his childhood, rather than his late teens or early twenties, when he would expect a psychotic mental illness to manifest. (See Doc. #23-8 at 416, App. 7388.) In addition, Dr. Frierson stated it would be very rare for someone with a major mental illness to have never been hospitalized and he did not believe Bixby's functioning had been significantly impaired. (See Doc. #23-8 at 416, App. 7388.)
Dr. Frierson opined that Bixby understood that his violent response to the property dispute was contrary to what a majority of society would expect, but that also believes that majority of society is wrong and he [*113]  is right. (See Doc. #23-8 at 418, App. 7390.)
On cross-examination, Dr. Frierson stated Bixby's was only the second penalty phase evaluation he had conducted and that he specifically asked the trial judge if he could be excused from conducting the evaluation due to ethical concerns. (See Doc. #23-8 at 420-21, 425-27, App. 7392-93, 7397-99.) He testified that grandiosity, a key component in his diagnosis, can also be a symptom of bipolar disorder, delusional disorder, and schizophrenia. (See Doc. #23-8 at 442-43, App. 7414-15.) However, he stood by his diagnosis, reiterating that Bixby was able to support himself, something he stated most people with schizophrenia could not do. (See Doc. #23-8 at 444, App. 7416.)
Regarding his finding that Bixby did not experience delusions, Dr. Frierson stated that Bixby had strongly held beliefs and fantasies, but that he was capable of changing those beliefs when confronted about them. (See Doc. #23-8 at 447-54, App. 7419-26.) Dr. Frierson explained that even though Bixby knew that his beliefs may not be true, his narcissism would prevent him from admitting any potential fallacy. (See Doc. #23-8 at 448, App. 7420.) However, Dr. Frierson also admitted, [*114]  for fear of losing Bixby's cooperation, he did not challenge many of his beliefs during his interviews. (See Doc. #23-8 at 449-53, App. 7421-25.) But, Dr. Frierson noted that, unlike delusions and psychotic mental illness, Bixby's condition did not fluctuate; it was pervasive and longstanding. (See Doc. #23-8 at 453, App. 7425.)
Dr. Frierson testified that he performed Arthur's 2008 competency evaluation and diagnosed vascular dementia with delusions. (See Doc. #23-8 at 457-58, App. 7429-30.) At that time, Dr. Frierson specifically rejected a suggestion by another doctor that Arthur may have a cognitive disorder. (See Doc. #23-8 at 459-60, App. 7431-32.)
Dr. Domino, a clinical psychologist brought in by Dr. Frierson, testified that she administered the PAI and RBANDS and found that Bixby's symptoms met the criteria for personality disorder not otherwise specified, with traits of narcissistic, paranoid, and schizotypal personality disorders. (See Doc. #23-8 at 482-83, App. 7454-55.) She did not consider Bixby's beliefs delusional because he did not show any other signs of psychotic mental illness—his speech was logical and his behavior and emotion for appropriate to the situation. (See [*115]  Doc. #23-8 at 483, App. 7455.) In addition, she indicated that while Bixby would hold strong to his beliefs, he would also concede that he may be in the minority. (See Doc. #23-8 at 483-84, App. 7455-56.) She testified that she did not ever use neuroimaging in her evaluations, that using neuroimaging was not standard practice, and that the science was in its infancy. (See Doc. #23-8 at 488, App. 7460.) She indicated that a finding that Bixby had frontal lobe damage would not be inconsistent with her impressions. (See Doc. #23-8 at 489, App. 7461.) And Dr. Domino stated that she could not rely on Dr. Gur's report under the applicable professional standards. (See Doc. #23-8 at 490, App. 7462.)
On cross-examination, Dr. Domino stated Bixby's evaluation is the only penalty phase evaluation she had ever conducted. (See Doc. #23-8 at 491, App. 7463.) She stated that the PAI results did not indicate that Bixby had a personality disorder, (See Doc. #23-8 at 493, App. 7465.), and she admitted that she was not familiar with the details of Dr. Gur's analysis, having only reviewed his one-page report. (See Doc. #23-8 at 495-96, App. 7467-68.)
In the second PCR hearing, Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified [*116]  that when she saw Bixby in August 2004, he described experiencing disturbing visual hallucinations and exhibited mood symptoms. (See Doc. #23-8 at 511-12, App. 7483-84.) She stated that Bixby's mental state deteriorated between 2004 and 2006, but began to improve in August 2006, prior to Dr. Frierson's competency evaluation. (See Doc. #23-8 at 512-13, App. 7484-85.) As a result of her evaluation in preparation for trial, Dr. Schwartz-Watts diagnosed Bixby with a major mental illness, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, alcohol abuse in a controlled environment, and cognitive disorder not otherwise specified. (See Doc. #23-8 at 520, App. 7492.)
Dr. Schwartz-Watts opined there was enough evidence in the records indicating Bixby had a preexisting mood disorder, then she observed prominent psychotic symptoms over the period of her evaluation. (See Doc. #23-8 at 521, App. 7493.) She testified that she based her cognitive disorder finding on a number of factors, including: a history of viral infections that may have affected his brain, reported head injuries, Dr. Brawley's testing, a scan showing brain atrophy, and her own clinical interviews. (See Doc. #23-8 at 522, App. 7494.)
Dr. Schwartz-Watts [*117]  reviewed Dr. Brawley's consultative report and stated Dr. Brawley found some severe deficits, problems with his learning ability, problems sequencing things, and problems with motor movements. (See Doc. #23-8 at 523, App. 7495.) She indicated Dr. Brawley suggested her findings were consistent with frontal lobe dysfunction. (See Doc. #23-8 at 523, App. 7495.) Dr. Schwartz-Watts stated the negative PET scan did not factor into her opinion that Bixby suffered from brain dysfunction, because that opinion was already supported by the neuropsychological testing and the MRI. (See Doc. #23-8 at 526-27, App. 7498-99.)
Dr. Schwartz-Watts also diagnosed narcissistic personality disorder as an Axis II disorder and agreed that there were shared traits between her opinion and Dr. Frierson's. (See Doc. #23-9 at 30, App. 7502.) She stated it was not uncommon for qualified psychiatrists using the exact same standards of practice to reach different conclusions. (See Doc. #23-9 at 30, App. 7502.) She testified that neuroimaging is not required to diagnose psychiatric conditions under the DSM IV guidelines and Dr. Gur's analysis and conclusion had not changed her opinion in this case. (See Doc. #23-9 at [*118]  32, App. 7504.) Dr. Schwartz-Watts opined that neuropsychological testing is still one of the most sensitive methods of picking up brain dysfunction, so she would rely on Dr. Brawley's findings. (See Doc. #23-9 at 33, App. 7505.)
On cross-examination, Dr. Schwartz-Watts stated that every time she saw Bixby after her 2004 evaluation she observed evidence of psychosis. (See Doc. #23-9 at 43, App. 7515.) She stated that, normally, schizophrenia would manifest in the late teens or early twenties. (See Doc. #23-9 at 44, App. 7516.) Dr. Schwartz-Watts explained that the difference between her opinion and Dr. Frierson's derived primarily from her view of Bixby's beliefs as delusional. (See Doc. #23-9 at 46-47, App. 7518-19.)
Dr. Schwartz-Watts opined that Bixby had brain damage, specifically in the frontal and temporal lobes. (See Doc. #23-9 at 48-50, App. 7520-22.) She testified that she was not familiar with Dr. Gur's methodology and had no opinion on it. (See Doc. #23-9 at 50, App. 7522.) She stated that the structural abnormalities Dr. Gur found showed some of the same deficits as Dr. Brawley's testing, and also showed temporal lobe deficits, which were consistent with her clinical observations. [*119]  (See Doc. #23-9 at 51, App. 7523.) Dr. Schwarz-Watts testified that Dr. Gur's findings generally expanded on and reinforced her findings. (See Doc. #23-9 at 52, App. 7524.) She reiterated that, in her opinion, there were indicators of both mental illness and brain damage prior to the 2003 incident. (See Doc. #23-9 at 53, App. 7525.) She agreed that just because someone has not been hospitalized does not mean he has not experienced a mental health event. (See Doc. #23-9 at 54, App. 7526.)
On redirect, Dr. Schwartz-Watts explained that, while some of Bixby's grandiosity came from his personality disorder, she found other forms clearly indicative of psychosis. (See Doc. #23-9 at 56, App. 7528.) She stated that she did not find evidence of psychosis before the crime and that Bixby's psychotic symptoms seemed to evolve as he dealt with incarceration and other stressors. (See Doc. #23-9 at 57, App. 7529.) She stated she considered a schizophrenia diagnosis, but ruled it out based on Bixby's predominant mood symptoms. (See Doc. #23-9 at 60-61, App. 7532-33.)
She testified that having additional tests indicating the possibility of brain damage would provide more evidence, but would not influence [*120]  her diagnosis. (See Doc. #23-9 at 60, App. 7532.) Dr. Schwartz-Watts specifically testified that, had she been provided with Dr. Gur's report, because she was not familiar with the methodology, she would have used his report as a source of information and included it as evidence of temporal lobe dysfunction, but would have had the same conclusions and diagnosis. (See Doc. #23-9 at 62, App. 7534.)
On re-cross, Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified that information that Rita was assessed as delusional would not have changed her opinion or diagnosis, but could have suggested a shared delusional disorder. (See Doc. #23-9 at 68-69, App. 7540-41.) She further stated that information that Arthur had been diagnosed with schizophrenia could have reinforced her diagnosis of Bixby and strengthened Bixby's family history. (See Doc. #23-9 at 70, App. 7542.)
Dr. Mayberg, an expert in neurology and neuroimaging, reviewed Bixby's 2006 PET scan and 2012 MRI and the associated radiology reports and did not find any structural abnormalities. (See Doc. #23-9 at 108-09, App. 7580-81.) She further reviewed Dr. Gur's findings, which included his presentation from the first PCR hearing, additional data summaries, and [*121]  a new set of analyses of the PET scan using a different control group. (See Doc. #23-9 at 111-15, App. 7583-87.) Dr. Mayberg's review showed that Dr. Gur's method produced different results depending on the composition of the control group and the scanner used on the control subjects. (See Doc. #23-9 at 126-27, App. 7598-99.) She stated that Dr. Gur's PET control group consisted of eight or sixteen men and women, but mostly women, of unknown age, and that none of the control subjects were scanned on the same scanner as Bixby. (See Doc. #23-9 at 122-23, 127, App. 7594-95, 7599.)
On cross-examination, Dr. Mayberg clarified that she does not have an opinion on whether Bixby has a major mental illness or brain damage or regarding his functioning at the time of the crime. (See Doc. #23-9 at 132, App. 7604.)
PCR counsel offered Dr. Gur as rebuttal testimony to Dr. Mayberg. Dr. Gur testified that he did not review the PET and MRI scans in isolation, but considered them within the context of Bixby's medical records, school records, mental health records, neuropsychological testing results, and his own observations during his personal evaluation. (See Doc. #23-9 at 177-78, App. 7649-50.) Dr. [*122]  Gur concluded that Bixby suffered from both brain damage and schizophrenia. (See Doc. #23-9 at 178, App. 7650.) He found support for his schizophrenia finding in Bixby's overall presentation, which he said consistently pointed to frontal and temporal limbic abnormalities. (See Doc. #23-9 at 180-82, App. 7652-54.) However, he found more abnormalities than he would expect for schizophrenia, leading him to conclude that Bixby suffered from additional damage, which, combined with the schizophrenia, would exacerbate Bixby's inability to conform his behavior to societal norms. (See Doc. #23-9 at 182, App. 7654.)
He explained that there were limits to the application of scientific literature in the clinical setting and described the role of clinical judgment as applying the literature to the individual case. (See Doc. #23-9 at 179, App. 7651.) Dr. Gur further testified that his methodology was supported by scientific literature. (See Doc. #23-9 at 180, App. 7652.)
Regarding the control groups, Dr. Gur stated that both the eight-person and sixteen-person PET control groups came from the PET Center and that the controls and Bixby were both studies in the default state, but on different scanners. [*123]  (See Doc. #23-9 at 183-85, App. 7655-57.) He further testified that the PET scanners used are now standardized and there is "never a problem comparing from one scanner to another." (See Doc. #23-9 at 189, App. 7661.) He also explained that sample sizes for PET control groups are smaller due to regulations restricting the use of PET on healthy people. (See Doc. #23-9 at 193, App. 7665.) Dr. Gur testified that there were slightly different values between the results using the two different groups, but that they were essentially the same and that all of the abnormalities present using the eight-person group were also present using the sixteen-person group. (See Doc. #23-9 at 185, App. 7657.) While he did concede that eliminating the female samples from the PET control group could have altered his results, he stated he did not need to alter his prior report based on the new test. (See Doc. #23-9 at 195-96, App. 7667-68.)
On cross-examination, when confronted with the information that he had not mentioned schizophrenia in either his earlier PCR testimony or his report, Dr. Gur stated his original role was not to offer a diagnosis. (See Doc. #23-9 at 198-99, App. 7670-71.) He testified that, [*124]  based on her testimony, Dr. Schwartz-Watts had diagnosed schizophrenia and that schizoaffective disorder was a type of schizophrenia. (See Doc. #23-9 at 200-01, App. 7672-73.) Dr. Gur also testified that a schizophrenia diagnosis is based on a clinical interview, not imaging, but that the types of abnormalities he observed in Bixby's scans were the same type he would expect in a person with schizophrenia. (See Doc. #23-9 at 217, App. 7689.) However, he also noted those abnormalities can be indicative of other conditions as well. (See Doc. #23-9 at 217, App. 7689.)
The State noted a large variation between the results of the eight-person study and the sixteen-person study in the hippocampus—the original results showed approximately seven deviations from normal and the new results showed approximately two. (See Doc. #23-9 at 210-11, App. 7682-83.) Dr. Gur stated the standard deviation was lower and the values of the controls were higher with the eight-person control group, that the new sample had many more females, and that we may never know the true results, but that they may be somewhere in between those two findings. (See Doc. #23-9 at 211-12, App. 7683-84.)
Dr. Gur testified that he [*125]  most likely reviewed Bixby's 2005 MRI, but that it would not have been useable for his analysis. (See Doc. #23-9 at 219, App. 7691.) So, he would have had to request a new MRI in order to perform his analysis and testify at trial. (See Doc. #23-9 at 219-20, App. 7691-92.)
On redirect, Dr. Gur testified that it is not uncommon to get unuseable scans and have to request new ones and that the email correspondence between himself and Bixby's trial attorneys would be a more accurate reflection of their communications than his current memory. (See Doc. #23-9 at 222-24, App. 7694-96.)

The PCR Court's Analysis
Regarding Bixby's allegation that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to supply Dr. Gur with the necessary information and, thus, acquire his report and potential testimony, the PCR court concluded that Bixby failed to show that trial counsel's alleged omissions resulted in prejudice. Rather, the PCR court found that Dr. Gur's testimony "differ[ed] from other diagnos[es] from medical doctors, lack[ed] impact as it lack[ed] support in the medical community, and [was] subject to change according to the control group he us[ed] in comparison." (Doc. #23-7 at 160, App. 6632.) For those [*126]  reasons, the PCR court concluded that Dr. Gur's opinion was "of little value for mitigation." (Doc. #23-7 at 160, App. 6632.)
The PCR court further found that, because Dr. Gur's opinion would not have altered or influenced either Dr. Schwartz-Watts's or Dr. Brawley's opinions, "the failure to obtain [Dr. Gur's] analysis [did] not directly impact the opinions prepared for trial, and [did] not show a failure by counsel to obtain testing necessary to make those informed opinions." (Doc. #23-7 at 160-61, App. 6632-33.) In addition, the PCR court noted that introducing Dr. Gur's schizophrenia diagnosis would have resulted in "discord among the defense team's experts." (Doc. #23-7 at 161, App. 6633.) Thus, the PCR court concluded that "whatever the value [Dr. Gur's] scan analysis could be (keeping in mind that dysfunction was already proven and the scans were read as within normal limits by the radiologists), is greatly undercut by the uncertainty of reliable results and the rejection of schizophrenia by the forensic psychiatrists both for the defense and the State." (Doc. #23-7 at 163, App. 6635.)
And, regarding Bixby's claim that he was ineligible for the death penalty due to his mental [*127]  health, cognitive functioning, and brain damage, the PCR court found the claim procedurally defaulted under state law, absent a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. (See Doc. #23-7 at 176-77, App. 6648-49.) The PCR court further found:
As to Applicant's further argument that he is "ineligible" for the death penalty due to "severe psychiatric and cognitive impairment," his argument fails on the case law and the facts. As to the facts, Applicant alleges his experts agree that he is psychotic and brain damaged. This vastly overstates the evidence from his experts . . . and wholly discounts Dr. Frierson's testimony. As to the case law, the only prohibition on capital punishment based on mental limitation is the discrete category of mental retardation. Applicant has no diagnosis of mental retardation. Applicant is in no way categorically exempt.
It is of no little note that every psychiatrist agreed that the steps taken to surrender and the process of surrender evidenced a reasoned series of actions by Applicant at a time of great stress. Further, the evidence showed a deliberate, strategized plan to use a massive collection of force to effect a standoff to live or die by their convictions. [*128]  Such convictions, though admittedly a minority view, coincide with a recognized belief shared by many. This was not, in itself, evidence of delusions.
(Doc. #23-7 at 179-81, App. 6651-53 (citations omitted).)

Analysis
Based on the record presented, the PCR court did not unreasonably apply established Supreme Court precedent or base its conclusions on an unreasonable factual finding in its analysis of this portion of Ground I.
As to Bixby's claims surrounding trial counsel's dysfunctional communication with Dr. Gur, the PCR court reasonably found that Bixby failed to show that, had Dr. Gur testified at trial, there was a reasonable probability that the jury would not have voted for death. Rather, the PCR testimony revealed Dr. Gur's analysis to be of questionable reliability and questionable import. Dr. Gur and others testified that his findings did not necessarily correlate to a specific diagnosis and his suggested diagnosis did not sync with that of any of the other mental health experts. Further, there was consensus among the experts that Dr. Brawley's evaluation comported with professional standards and, in large part, Dr. Gur's specific findings, independent of his suggested diagnosis, [*129]  were duplicative of Dr. Brawley's findings and supported her conclusion that Bixby suffered from a cognitive deficit. Thus, while Dr. Gur's testimony may have supported or reinforced Dr. Brawley's, it would not have significantly altered the information presented to the jury. Accordingly, Bixby has not shown a reasonable probability of a different outcome had Dr. Gur testified at trial or that the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable. See Sears v. Upton, 561 U.S. 945, 954, 130 S. Ct. 3259, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1025 (2010) ("[T]here is no prejudice when the new mitigating evidence 'would barely have altered the sentencing profile presented' to the decisionmaker.") (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 700); Sexton, 163 F.3d at 882.24
Regarding Bixby's Atkins claim, this Court will not disturb the PCR court's finding that the claim was barred from PCR review under state law. See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1991) ("[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions. In conducting habeas review, a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction violated the Constitution, law, or treaties of the United States.") (citations omitted). The undersigned further finds reasonable the PCR court's conclusion that Bixby has failed to present a proper Atkins claim.
In [*130]  Atkins, the Supreme Court specifically held that the Eighth Amendment "restrict[s] . . . the State's power to take the life of" any intellectually disabled individual. 536 U.S. at 321. The Supreme Court has not defined "intellectual disability," but left to the states "the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon [their] execution of sentences." Id. at 317. South Carolina has defined intellectual disability as "significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period." S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-20(C)(b)(10).
Bixby claims that this standard applies to him because his "mental illness and brain damage combine to make him ineligible for the death penalty, both individually and as a member of a class of individuals who are categorically exempt, the severely mentally ill." (Doc. #23-3 at 307, App. 5779.) However, nowhere in his briefing does Bixby allege that he is actually intellectually disabled. In fact, he cites to portions of the record establishing that his intellectual functioning is "right above borderline." (See Doc. #23-3 at 311, App. 5783.) Thus, based on the record presented, he does not fall within the category [*131]  of persons constitutionally exempt from execution.25
For the foregoing reasons, the undersigned finds Bixby has failed to show that he is entitled to relief and recommends granting summary judgment as to Ground I.

Ground II: Trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the jury instruction that malice could be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon.
In Ground II, Bixby alleges that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to object to the following jury instructions:
Inferred malice may also arise when the deed is done with a deadly weapon. A deadly weapon is any article, instrument, or substance which is likely to cause death or great bodily harm. Whether an instrument has been used as a deadly weapon depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.
(Doc. #22-1 at 138-39, App. 3110-11.) This ground was raised to and ruled upon by the PCR court, and was raised in the petition for writ of certiorari to the South Carolina Supreme Court. (See Doc. #23-7 at 124-28, App. 6596-6600; Doc. #24-4 at 116-20.) Thus, Ground II is properly preserved for this Court's review. As with the majority of the grounds raised in the instant action, habeas counsel have adopted [*132]  the arguments raised by PCR counsel in their post-hearing brief.26 (See Doc. #72-1 at 74 (incorporating by reference PCR post-hearing brief, App. 5788-96).)
Bixby alleges that trial counsel knew the above instruction was objectionable because Mr. Grose objected to a similar instruction in a prior case and testified that he had discussed the basis for that objection with a colleague in the context of Bixby's case. (See Doc. #23-3 at 317, App. 5789.) The South Carolina Supreme Court later relied on that basis in reversing the use of the instruction in State v. Belcher and held that "a jury charge instructing that malice may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon is no longer good law in South Carolina where evidence is presented that would reduce, mitigate, excuse, or justify the homicide." 385 S.C. 597, 685 S.E.2d 802, 803-04 (S.C. 2009). The court recognized that its "decision represent[ed] a clear break from [its] modern precedent," and thus, made the ruling in Belcher "effective in this case and for all cases which are pending on direct review or not yet final where the issue is preserved." Id. at 810. However, the court specifically indicated, "[o]ur ruling . . . will not apply to convictions challenged on post-conviction relief." Id. [*133] 
After reviewing Belcher, including the above excerpts regarding the applicability of the case, the PCR court held "[t]his language specifically bars reliance on Belcher in post-conviction relief proceedings. Thus, the issue raised cannot be reached in these proceedings, and the Applicant's claim for relief on this issue is denied." (Doc. #23-7 at 125, App. 6597.) However, the PCR court went on to analyze Bixby's ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Strickland and found Bixby had not proved prejudice. Specifically, the PCR court found that because "[t]he record shows there was no remotely legitimate claim of self-defense or any other legally cognizable claim to 'mitigate, excuse or justify' the killing, in regard to the shooting of State Constable Ouzts," the giving of the instruction in Bixby's trial, at least regarding Constable Ouzts, would not have offended Belcher. (Doc. #23-7 at 125-26, App. 6597-98.) The PCR court further found that the record did not support a prejudice finding because the jury instructions as a whole were sufficient. (See Doc. #23-7 at 126-27, App. 6598-99.)
"The construction of when a change in state law should become effective is purely a state law [*134]  issue. Thus, State v. Belcher is inapplicable to the instant matter." McCrea v. McCabe, C/A No. 3:11-cv-1390-RMG, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97930, 2012 WL 2890005 at *4 (D.S.C.) (citing Estelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68); see also Ward v. Warden of Lieber Correctional Inst., C/A No. 0:11-3277-RBH-PJG, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40527, 2013 WL 1187133 at *18 (D.S.C. Feb. 15, 2013) ("The Belcher decision represented a change in state law, and 'it is not the province of a federal habeas corpus court to re-examine state-court determinations of state-law questions.'" (quoting Estelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68)).
Moreover, Bixby has failed to show how his trial counsel could be ineffective for failing to make an objection during his 2007 trial based on Belcher, which the court decided two years later, in 2009. The law does not require attorneys to be clairvoyant or anticipate changes in the law. See United States v. Harms, 371 F.3d 1208, 1212 (10th Cir. 2004) ("The Sixth Amendment does not require counsel for a criminal defendant to be clairvoyant."); Gilmore v. State, 314 S.C. 453, 445 S.E.2d 454, 457 (S.C. 1994) ("We have never required an attorney to be clairvoyant or anticipate changes in the law which were not in existence at the time of trial."), overruled on other grounds by Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (S.C. 1999).
Additionally, Bixby fails to demonstrate that the PCR court's alternative holding—that Petitioner suffered no prejudice from trial counsel's failure to object to the implied malice charge—was the result of unreasonable factual findings or is contrary to, or an unreasonable [*135]  application of, federal law. (See Doc. #23-7 at 125-27.) Thus, Bixby has failed to articulate how the PCR court's determinations reflect either unreasonable factual findings or an unreasonable application of federal law.
For these reasons, Bixby has not demonstrated to this Court that he is entitled to relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 as to Ground II. Accordingly, the undersigned recommends granting summary judgment as to this claim.

Ground III: Trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective for failing to recall Patrick White to testify in the sentencing phase.
In Ground III, Bixby alleges that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to call a witness, Patrick White, to testify during the sentencing phase. Again, habeas counsel adopt the arguments levied by PCR counsel on this issue.27 (See Doc. #72-1 at 74 (incorporating by reference PCR post-hearing brief, App. 5796-98).) As this ground is preserved for habeas review,28 the undersigned now reviews the PCR court's decision.
In Bixby's direct appeal, the South Carolina Supreme Court considered whether Mr. White's testimony should have been admitted during the guilt phase:
Appellant attempted to present the testimony of Patrick White (White), who [*136]  was retained by Appellant to conduct a title abstract on the Bixby property. Appellant wanted to establish, through White's testimony, that he had a good faith belief that there was no right of way on the Bixby property. Further, Appellant wanted to rebut the State's argument that the records concerning the right of way were easily accessible to the public. The State objected to the witness's testimony as irrelevant.
During an in camera hearing, title abstractor White's testimony was proffered to the trial judge. White said that he found no record of any easements, encroachments, or rights-of-way pertaining to the Bixby property filed at the Abbeville County Clerk of Court's office. The trial judge asked White if he was familiar with S.C. Code Ann. § 57-5-570 (1993), which requires that copies of highway plans with right of way designation be maintained in the tax assessor's office for each county. White replied that he was not familiar with this statutory provision and that he did not search the tax assessor's office for a record of the right of way. The trial judge ruled that White's testimony was irrelevant and inadmissible because White was unaware of section 57-5-570 and did not conduct a complete search for the public [*137]  record of the rights-of-way on the Bixby property.
"'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence." Rule 401, SCRE. White's testimony was not relevant to the defense's position because he only looked for records of the right of way at the Abbeville County Clerk of Court's office. Because White did not search for a record of the right of way in the county tax assessor's office where S.C. Code Ann. § 57-5-570 requires that they be maintained, his testimony did not have the tendency to make it more or less probable that 1) Appellant had a good faith belief that there was no right of way on his family's land, and 2) the records concerning the right of way were not easily accessible to the public.
In any event, even if White's testimony were relevant, its exclusion by the trial court was appropriate pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE, because it would have misled the jury. White's testimony that he did not find any record of the right of way at the court house would only lead the jury to believe that a right of way should have been recorded at the clerk of court's office, which is [*138]  contrary to state law.
Bixby, 698 S.E.2d at 580-81.
In his PCR action, Bixby argued that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to call Mr. White during the penalty phase. (See Doc. #23-3 at 322-26, App. 5794-98.) The PCR court rejected that claim, finding that, based on the South Carolina Supreme Court's decision, "Mr. White's testimony ha[d] been found to be irrelevant to Applicant's state of mind, i.e., a good faith belief that there was not a right of way on Applicant's parents' property. Thus, it is not admissible for that reason at any stage." (See Doc. #23-7 at 128-29, App. 6600-01.) Additionally, the PCR court found that Bixby suffered "no unfair prejudice" by the absence of Mr. White's testimony in the penalty phase. (See Doc. #23-7 at 129, App. 6601.)
Bixby argues that "White's testimony was relevant and admissible in the penalty phase. Capital defendants are entitled to present penalty phase evidence 'as a mitigating factor, any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.'" (Doc. #23-3 at 325, App. 5797 (quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978)).) Bixby further asserts that Mr. White's testimony "was relevant to whether reasonable efforts by Mr. Bixby and his parents [*139]  would have uncovered the right of way." (Doc. #23-3 at 325, App. 5797.) While Bixby apparently disagrees with the PCR court's finding that Mr. White's testimony was irrelevant to the issues to be decided in the penalty phase, he fails to demonstrate either unreasonable factual findings or an unreasonable application of federal law by the state courts.
In Lockett v. Ohio, a leading case broadly defining the types of admissible mitigating evidence in the penalty phases of capital trials, the United States Supreme Court noted "[n]othing in this opinion limits the traditional authority of a court to exclude, as irrelevant, evidence not bearing on the defendant's character, prior record, or the circumstances of his offense." 438 U.S. 586, 604 n.12, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978).
There is no evidence that Bixby or his family relied upon Mr. White's search. (See Doc. #83 at 87.) Rather, trial counsel testified during the PCR evidentiary hearing that they intended to introduce Mr. White's testimony "to corroborate statements that [Rita Bixby] had made about that document not being in the clerk of court's records." (Doc. #23-8 at 369, App. 7341.)
However, Bixby argues:
In the penalty phase, trial counsel sought to explain why Mr. Bixby was vulnerable [*140]  to his mother's worldview. Mr. White's testimony would have provided the only evidence that Mr. Bixby had a reasonable basis for believing his family was unjustly losing its property. It would have established that even a professional title searcher would have had trouble locating the right of way.
(Doc. #23-3 at 326, App. 5798.)
The undersigned fails to see how this evidence—that a witness, who the family did not consult, failed to find a document recording the right of way in a location where it was not legally required to be—was relevant to Bixby's character, prior record, or the circumstances of the offense. Bixby fails to show what evidence in the record supports why or how White's testimony would make any belief of Bixby as to the existence of a valid easement more or less reasonable. Clearly, he fails to show by clear and convincing evidence that factual findings of the PCR court were unreasonable or that the PCR court misapplied federal law. Thus, the undersigned finds reasonable the PCR court's findings that the evidence was irrelevant, even in the penalty phase, and that Bixby did not suffer prejudice by its exclusion.
For these reasons, Bixby has failed to meet his burden under [*141]  28 U.S.C. § 2254 as to Ground III. Accordingly, the undersigned recommends granting summary judgment as to this ground.

Ground IV: Appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to adequately brief procedural bar issues.
In Ground IV, Bixby argues his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately brief a procedural bar issue in his direct appeal. (See Doc. #72-1 at 75.) Bixby raised this ground in his PCR application, and the PCR court addressed his claim on the merits. (See Doc. #23-7 at 129-37, App. 6601-09.) This issue was also raised to the South Carolina Supreme Court in Bixby's petition for writ of certiorari. (See Doc. #24-4 at 122-28.) Thus, this ground is properly preserved for review in this action.
This ground concerns an alleged failure by appellate counsel to adequately brief the procedural bar of a voir dire issue. Strickland's deficiency and prejudice standards apply with equal force to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. See Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 120 S. Ct. 746, 145 L. Ed. 2d 756 (2000). However, as the Supreme Court has noted, while it is "possible to bring a Strickland claim based on counsel's failure to raise a particular claim, [] it is difficult to demonstrate that counsel was incompetent." Id. at 288 [*142] . Here, Bixby goes one step further and alleges appellate counsel were ineffective for not adequately briefing the claim.
At the beginning of jury selection, the trial court explained that the death penalty was only applicable to aggravated cases of murder and the prosecutor recited the charges against Bixby. (See Doc. #21-1 at 62,67, App. 0034, 0039.) However, Bixby asserts that neither the trial court nor the prosecutor defined murder as intentional and malicious. (See Doc. #23-3 at 327, App. 5799.) Trial counsel, therefore, attempted to define murder for the jurors during voir dire and explain that murder did not include accidental killings or self-defense. (See, e.g., Doc. #21-3 at 325-26, App. 0797-98.) Some potential jurors, after hearing counsel's definition, declared they were unable to consider a life sentence for someone who committed intentional and malicious murder. (See, e.g., Doc. #21-3 at 327-29, App. 0799-801.) In the middle of voir dire, after counsel had questioned twenty-one potential jurors, the trial court ordered counsel to stop defining murder for the jurors. (See Doc. #21-3 at 330-31, App. 0802-03.) Trial counsel eventually objected, asserting that "Part of the [*143]  guarantee of a defendant's right to impanel a jury is adequate voir dire to identify unqualified candidates" and relying on Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 119 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1992), and State v. Goolsby, 275 S.C. 110, 268 S.E.2d 31 (1980). (See Doc. #21-5 at 129-30, App. 1101-02.) However, trial counsel only used seven of their ten strikes during jury selection, potentially resulting in the applicability of a state procedural bar. See State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260, 264 (S.C. 1996) (holding "[f]ailure to exhaust all of a defendant's peremptory strikes will preclude appellate review of juror qualification issues").
It is clear from the record that appellate counsel did brief both the voir dire issue and the applicability of the procedural bar. Specifically, appellate counsel "argue[d] that the trial judge abused his discretion when he did not allow defense counsel to probe jurors concerning the definition of 'murder' because this ruling prevented him from ascertaining each potential juror's qualification with regard to their views on capital punishment." Bixby, 388 S.C. 528, 698 S.E.2d 572, 579. Further, appellate counsel addressed the procedural bar in his opening brief and his reply to the South Carolina Supreme Court. (See Doc. #23-7 at 131, App. 6603 (listing relevant citations)). Nevertheless, the South Carolina Supreme Court found the procedural bar applicable. See Bixby, 698 S.E.2d at 579-80 (finding [*144]  the voir dire issue barred since trial counsel "used only seven of the ten strikes during jury selection" and state law required counsel to exhaust all strikes to preserve appellate review of a juror qualification issue). In the alternative, the court found Bixby's claim without merit because: (1) trial counsel had not moved to disqualify any of the jurors actually impaneled; (2) the qualification of jurors was extensive; and (3) the definition of murder is disseminated through jury instructions, not questioning on voir dire. See id. Appellate counsel challenged the court's findings in his petition for rehearing, including additional and expanded arguments and authority, and in his eventual filings to the United States Supreme Court. (See Doc. #23-7 at 131, App. 6603.) However, Bixby asserts that appellate counsel was ineffective for "failing to include the law and analysis in the Petition for Rehearing in Mr. Bixby's initial brief." (Doc. #23-3 at 330, App. 5802.)
On this issue, the PCR court found that Bixby could not meet either prong of Strickland—first, because "the Supreme Court of South Carolina considered the bar, and applied the bar over appellate counsel's argument," and second, [*145]  because the court alternatively considered and rejected the voir dire claim on its merits. (See Doc. #23-7 at 131, App. 6603.) Bixby has failed to demonstrate that the PCR court's order either is based on unreasonable factual findings or is the result of an unreasonable application of federal law. Based on this Court's review of the PCR court's order, it appears that the PCR court properly applied the Strickland standards in finding no deficiency and no prejudice on this ground. (See Doc. #23-7 at 131-37, App. 6603-09.)
The undersigned would further note that Bixby's ability to succeed on this ground depends, in part, on a question of state law, which the state courts have decided, and which is entitled to great deference here. In particular, Bixby argues that, had appellate counsel adequately briefed the procedural bar issue, the South Carolina Supreme Court would not have applied the procedural bar. (Doc. #23-3 at 329-34, App. 5801-06.) However, Bixby has failed to provide any persuasive authority that the South Carolina Supreme Court would have found differently had appellate counsel presented additional briefing on the issue prior to the motion for reconsideration. Notably, the [*146]  dissent agreed with appellate counsel's contention that the procedural bar should not apply. (Compare Bixby, 388 S.C. 528, 698 S.E.2d 572, 589 (J. Pleicones, dissenting), and Doc. #22-7 at 159.) Nevertheless, the South Carolina Supreme Court found that the procedural bar applied to Bixby's voir dire issue. That finding was not upended during the PCR proceedings. To the contrary, the PCR court noted that the application of the procedural bar was appropriate based on prior state precedent. (See Doc. #23-7 at 133-34, App. 6605-06.) This Court has no authority to redetermine the applicability of a procedural bar, which is decidedly a question of state law. See Estelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68 ("[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions."); Sharpe v. Bell, 593 F.3d 372, 383 (4th Cir. 2010) ("It is beyond the mandate of federal habeas courts [ ] to correct the interpretation by state courts of a state's own laws."). For these reasons, Bixby has failed to meet his burden under § 2254 as to Ground IV. Accordingly, the undersigned recommends granting summary judgment as to this ground.

Ground V: Bixby's rights to due process and the effective assistance of counsel were violated by trial counsel's failure to: (1) present evidence and offer argument [*147]  during the guilt phase to the extent that the jury reached the conclusion that Bixby was the shooter, (2) argue that the jury was improperly permitted to engage in premature deliberations, (3) prevent jury misconduct that tainted the verdict and sentence, and (4) adequately argue that the imposition of death violates the United States Constitution.
The majority of Ground V concerns the PCR court's pre-hearing finding that Bixby could not admit into evidence a statement from juror Timothy Wilson. In support of this ground, like the previous grounds, Bixby offers PCR counsel's arguments in their post-hearing brief. (See Doc. #72-1 at 75 (incorporating by reference PCR post-hearing brief, App. 5802-07).) The portion of the post-hearing brief Bixby incorporates as part of Ground V includes the second half of post-hearing brief claim (h), which is actually Ground IV of the Petition and is discussed above. (See Doc. #23-3 at 330-34, App. 5802-06.) The only argument pertaining to Ground V constitutes approximately one page of the post-hearing brief. (See Doc. #23-3 at 334-35, App. 5806-07.) The majority of that page provides the relevant background information, then, Bixby "concedes that he [*148]  presented no evidence to support" this claim. (See Doc. #23-3 at 335, App. 5807.)
Bixby presented this claim to the PCR court as follows: "During the guilt phase the jury reached the conclusion that Mr. Bixby was the shooter in the incident giving rise to the charges. Once some members of the jury reached that conclusion, they foreclosed the possibility of a life sentence." (See Doc. 323-7 at 137, App. 6609.) And the PCR court found:
This Court held a hearing on December 4, 2012, on Respondent's motion for a ruling on the admissibility of the "affidavit" of Timothy Wilson. This Court found the statement offered was not an affidavit as the statement was not properly notarized. Further, the assertions in paragraph two of the statement went to a withdrawn allegation and were not relevant. The assertions in the final paragraph purported to reflect discussions "[d]uring the penalty deliberations." This Court found that nothing in the paragraph indicated an improper act, improper comment or the introduction of extraneous matter such as would allow admissibility under the limited exceptions of Rule 606(b), SCRE. The Rule prevents admissibility of testimony or affidavit regarding jury deliberations "except that [*149]  a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror." Id. Thus, the statement, if it had been in proper form, would not have been admissible under the Rule. Further, because the assertions in the statement did not fall under these serious and limited exceptions, and there was no evidence of any juror misconduct, much less conduct that would affect fundamental fairness, the exclusion of the affidavit was not unfairly prejudicial.
At any rate, Applicant concedes in his post-hearing brief that he has failed to present any claim in support of the allegations. Consequently, he fails to carry his burden of proof.
(Doc. #23-7 at 137-39, App. 6609-11 (some citations omitted).)
To the extent this portion of Ground V challenges the PCR court's evidentiary ruling, Bixby has failed to sufficiently allege how the court's ruling denied his constitutional rights. See Barbe v. McBride, 521 F.3d 443, 452 (4th Cir. 2008) ("Importantly, in considering federal habeas corpus issues involving state evidentiary rulings, 'we do not sit to review the admissibility of evidence under state law unless erroneous [*150]  evidentiary rulings were so extreme as to result in a denial of a constitutionally fair proceeding.'") (quoting Burket v. Angelone, 208 F.3d 172, 186 (4th Cir. 2000)).
In fact, Bixby has not actually alleged any error in the PCR court's evidentiary ruling. Nor has Bixby offered additional evidence of premature deliberations or juror misconduct or that trial counsel should have been aware of misconduct. Accordingly, the undersigned cannot find that the PCR court unreasonably found that Bixby failed to meet his burden of proof on this claim. "It should go without saying that the absence of evidence cannot overcome the 'strong presumption that counsel's conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.'" Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.S. 12, 22-23, 134 S. Ct. 10, 187 L. Ed. 2d 348 (2013) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689). As to Bixby's allegation that trial counsel failed to adequately argue that the imposition of death violates the United States Constitution, Bixby has not offered any argument in support of this claim in the Petition, incorporated from the PCR post-hearing brief, or in any of the subsequent briefing. "The failure of a party to address an issue raised in summary judgment may be considered a waiver or abandonment of the relevant cause of action." Eady v. Veolia Transp. Servs., Inc., 609 F. Supp. 2d 540, 560-61 (D.S.C. 2009). Further, based this Court's review of the record and the [*151]  briefing, it does not appear this issue has been raised to and ruled upon by the state courts. Thus, as Respondents have asserted (see Doc. #83 at 105), this conclusory, unsupported portion of Ground V is also procedurally defaulted. See, e.g., Coleman, 501 U.S. at 735 n.1. Bixby has neither acknowledged the default nor asserted cause and prejudice to overcome it.
For these reasons, the undersigned recommends granting summary judgment as to Ground V.

Ground VI: Bixby's rights to due process and the effective assistance of counsel were violated by trial counsel's failure to protect Bixby's rights under the American's with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et. seq.
In Ground VI, Bixby argues that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to protect his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et. seq. (Doc. #72-1 at 75.) He further alleges:
(26) The State of South Carolina and its political subdivisions are bound by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) as amended (42 U.S.C. § 12101, et. seq.) in the manner in which they investigate criminal activity and carry out criminal trials and impose the sentence of death. Bixby was and is seriously "disabled" within the meaning of the ADA. See claims/allegations 1-12, supra. Trial counsel and appellate [*152]  counsel were ineffective and prejudicially failed to recognize Bixby's disability and respond to it in a manner consistent with the ADA. Trial and appellate counsel were appointed by the State. The failure to properly respond to Bixby as required by the ADA persisted through the state post-conviction relief process. Bixby was functionally unable to assist trial and appellate counsel in his defense, as well as in the preparation of his case and his claims on state PCR. Therefore, Bixby was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial and his claims were not fully and adequately litigated.
(27) In addition and regard to claim (26) above, trial counsel did not adequately present evidence and argument at trial that state and local law enforcement officials were insufficiently trained in investigating, apprehending, and interrogating disabled persons as defined by the ADA. Had law enforcement been adequately trained the incident underlying this crime may well never have occurred. Evidence to this effect was not presented to the jury severely prejudicing Bixby.
(Doc. #72 at 6-7.) Thus, it appears that Bixby's Ground VI incorporates a variety of ineffective assistance of counsel claims: [*153]  (1) trial counsel were ineffective for failing to recognize and respond to Bixby's disability in a manner consistent with the ADA; (2) appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to recognize and respond to Bixby's disability in a manner consistent with the ADA; (3) PCR counsel were ineffective for failing to properly respond to Bixby as required by the ADA; (4) trial counsel were ineffective for failing to present evidence and argument at trial that state and local law enforcement officials were insufficiently trained in investigating, apprehending, and interrogating disabled persons as defined by the ADA. These claims will be discussed below; however, it appears that the primary argument advanced by Bixby is that trial counsel were ineffective in failing to present in mitigation violations of the ADA by local law enforcement upon approaching Bixby on the day of the murders.
The parties agree that these claims are procedurally barred as they were never raised to and ruled upon by the PCR court. (See Doc. #83 at 108-09; Doc. #92 at 3.) As previously mentioned, in order for a federal habeas court to consider a procedurally defaulted claim, the petitioner must "demonstrate cause for [*154]  the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice." Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750.
In Coleman, the Court held that because "[t]here is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings . . ., a petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings." 501 U.S. at 752. Subsequently, in Martinez, the Court recognized a narrow exception to the rule established in Coleman and held that "[i]nadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review collateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner's procedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at trial." Id., 566 U.S. at 9 (emphasis added). Martinez held that if a state, such as South Carolina, requires a prisoner to raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a collateral proceeding, then a prisoner may establish cause for a default of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in the following two circumstances:
[1] where the state courts did not appoint counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding for a claim of ineffective assistance at trial [and 2] where appointed [*155]  counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding, where the claim should have been raised, was ineffective under the standards of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). To overcome the default, a prisoner must also demonstrate that the underlying ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say that the prisoner must demonstrate that the claim has some merit. Cf. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 123 S. Ct. 1029, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931 (2003) (describing standards for certificates of appealability to issue).
566 U.S. at 14; see also Sexton v. Cozner, 679 F.3d 1150, 1159 (9th Cir. 2012) (summarizing the Martinez test as follows: "[A] reviewing court must determine whether the petitioner's attorney in the first collateral proceeding was ineffective under Strickland, whether the petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is substantial, and whether there is prejudice").
Thus, under Martinez, Bixby may establish cause for the default of Ground VI if he can make two showings: First, Bixby must show under Strickland that his PCR counsel's representation was objectively unreasonable for failing to raise the underlying claim that trial counsel were ineffective. Wilson v. Stevenson, C.A. No. 9:15-02130-MBS-BM, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95004, 2016 WL 3896846 at *11 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, 2016), citing Ford v. McCall, C.A. No. 8:12-cv-02266-GRA, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114517, 2013 WL 4434389, at *26 (D.S.C. Aug. 14, 2013)); see also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. at 391 ("[T]he Strickland test provides sufficient guidance for [*156]  resolving virtually all ineffective assistance-of-counsel claims."). With respect to PCR counsel's performance, the undersigned is mindful that appellate counsel is not required to bring every possible claim before a court to avoid being found ineffective. See, e.g., Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 754, 103 S. Ct. 3308, 77 L. Ed. 2d 987 (1983) (holding that appellate counsel has no constitutional duty to raise every non-frivolous claim on appeal).
In addition to making the first showing, Bixby must also demonstrate that the underlying claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is substantial—that it has some merit. Martinez, 566 U.S. at 14. As Martinez teaches, the evaluation of whether there is a "substantial" claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is informed by Miller-El, which holds that in order to make a "substantial showing," a petitioner must "sho[w] that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were 'adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.'" Id., 537 U.S. at 336 (quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. at 484). However, if the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim "is insubstantial, i.e., it does not have any merit or . . . is wholly without factual support," the procedural [*157]  default precludes federal habeas review. Martinez, 566 U.S. at 16.
As an initial matter, some of the claims raised within Bixby's Ground VI fall outside of the bounds of Martinez. For example, the procedural default of Bixby's ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim cannot be excused pursuant to Martinez. See Davila v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2065, 198 L. Ed. 2d 603 (2017) ("Petitioner asks us to extend Martinez to allow a federal court to hear a substantial, but procedurally defaulted, claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when a prisoner's state postconviction counsel provides ineffective assistance by failing to raise that claim. We decline to do so."). Bixby has failed to show any other cause for the default of that claim. Additionally, to the extent Bixby seeks habeas relief based on his freestanding claim of ineffective assistance of PCR counsel, that claim, too, is outside of the scope of Martinez. See Martinez, 566 U.S. at 16 (cautioning that Martinez is an equitable ruling, one that does not establish a freestanding constitutional claim regarding collateral counsel's representation). Accordingly, the undersigned recommends denying and dismissing those portions of Ground VI.
As to the remaining claims in Ground VI, Bixby has failed to meet his burden under Martinez [*158] . First, he has failed to present any evidence regarding PCR counsel's recognition of, investigation of, or decision-making as to the underlying claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. As described previously, this Court's review of counsel's performance is highly deferential and Bixby bears the burden of "overcom[ing] the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action 'might be considered sound trial strategy.'" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.
Bixby has provided no evidence, by way of the state court record, affidavits, or depositions, regarding PCR counsel's strategic decisions, or lack thereof, in failing to raise the underlying ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims in this ground. "It should go without saying that the absence of evidence cannot overcome the 'strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.'" Burt, 571 U.S. at 17(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689). Having failed to show ineffective assistance of PCR counsel, Bixby has failed to meet his burden under Martinez. Cf. Runningeagle v. Ryan, 825 F.3d 970, 984 (9th Cir. 2016) ("Given the 'highly deferential' standard under which we evaluate [collateral counsel's] performance, and the paucity of evidence that [collateral counsel] performed deficiently—which [*159]  [petitioner] had a full opportunity to develop in district court following our limited remand—[petitioner] failed to overcome the 'strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.'").
Bixby has similarly failed to provide any evidence regarding the underlying allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel—either that trial counsel failed to represent Bixby in a manner consistent with the ADA or that they ineffectively failed to present evidence and argument that law enforcement officers had not appropriately complied with the ADA. Again, "counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment." Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.
Initially, the ADA is a statutory scheme designed to protect persons with a disability from discrimination. In order to qualify as having a disability under the ADA, a person must have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). The ADA defines "major life activities" as follows:
(A) In general
For purposes of paragraph (1), major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, [*160]  performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.
(B) Major bodily functions
For purposes of paragraph (1), a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.
42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A)-(B).
Bixby references generally sixty-six pages of Applicant's Post-Hearing Brief filed on PCR. (See App. 5655-5720.)29 Nowhere does Bixby set forth a condition that qualifies him as disabled under the ADA; that shows he was substantially limited in a major life activity. Furthermore, Bixby fails to show, assuming a disability for the sake of argument, who knew of the disability, or regarded Bixby as having a disability, when they knew of the disability, and what provision could have been made to accommodate that assumed disability. Bixby has not articulated how trial counsel's representation fell short of any obligations under Strickland and, therefore, Bixby has failed to establish a substantial [*161]  claim that trial counsel were deficient in their representation.
Bixby presents bald assertions that he "was functionally unable to assist trial and appellate counsel in his defense" and that this incident may have been altogether avoided by compliance with the ADA by the law enforcement personnel involved. Again, Bixby fails to identify a particular disability or specify any particular accommodation required by the ADA applicable to that particular disability.
As outlined above, Bixby has failed to meet his burden under Martinez. He has not shown that PCR counsel were ineffective in failing to raise particular claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, nor has he shown that those underlying claims are substantial. Accordingly, he cannot overcome the procedural bar of his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims and the undersigned recommends granting Respondents' motion for summary judgment as to Ground VI.

Request for Discovery and an Evidentiary Hearing
In his supplemental briefing on Ground VI, Bixby asserts "he is entitled to discovery and a hearing on the applicability of the ADA to his case." (Doc. #80 at 7.)
Like all § 2254 habeas cases, discovery in capital § 2254 cases is governed [*162]  by Rules 6 through 8 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases. A habeas petitioner "is not entitled to discovery as a matter of ordinary course." Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 904, 117 S. Ct. 1793, 138 L. Ed. 2d 97 (1997). Rather, under Rule 6(a), "A judge may, for good cause, authorize a party to conduct discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and may limit the extent of discovery." Good cause exists where "specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief." Bracy, 520 U.S. at 908-09 (quotation and alteration omitted); see Stephens v. Branker, 570 F.3d 198, 213 (4th Cir. 2009); see also Williams v. Bagley, 380 F.3d 932, 974 (6th Cir. 2004) (finding Rule 6 does not "sanction fishing expeditions based on a petitioner's conclusory allegations").
Here, Bixby asserts he "is entitled to discover and investigate what training had been made available to state, county, and city law enforcement officials who investigated his case and participate[d] in his violent and tragic arrest." (Doc. #80 at 7-8.) While it is possible that information exists that could support Bixby's allegation that law enforcement personnel did not receive proper ADA training, Bixby still has not specifically alleged that he was disabled at the time of his arrest or how law enforcement officials should have known of his disability. Furthermore, there is [*163]  no showing or even argument that the ADA requires any particular action or accommodation under any presumed facts. The court is left to engage in pure speculation as to any possible application of the ADA to the circumstances of this case. Thus, Bixby has not specifically alleged facts which, if proven, would entitle him to relief, and has, therefore, not shown good cause for discovery on this ground.
Regarding Bixby's request for an evidentiary hearing, under the AEDPA, evidentiary hearings are generally prohibited, even when a habeas petitioner has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in his state court proceedings. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2); Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 181-84, 131 S. Ct. 1388, 179 L. Ed. 2d 557 (2011) (recognizing both that "review under § 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits" and also that for claims for which the factual basis was not developed in state court, "§ 2254(e)(2) bars a federal court from holding an evidentiary hearing, unless the applicant meets certain statutory requirements"). "In deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing, a federal court must consider whether such a hearing could enable an applicant to prove the petition's factual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the applicant [*164]  to federal habeas relief." Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 474, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2007); see also Nickerson v. Lee, 971 F.2d 1125, 1136 (4th Cir. 1992) ("In order to obtain an evidentiary hearing . . . a habeas petitioner must come forward with some evidence that the claim might have merit. Unsupported, conclusory allegations do not entitle a habeas petitioner to an evidentiary hearing."), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 923, 113 S. Ct. 1289, 122 L. Ed. 2d 681, abrogated on other grounds by Yeatts v. Angelone, 166 F.3d 255 (4th Cir. 1999); Zettlemoyer v. Fulcomer, 923 F.2d 284, 301 (3d Cir. 1991) ("[B]ald assertions and conclusory allegations do not provide sufficient ground to warrant requiring the state to respond to discovery or to require an evidentiary hearing.").
Martinez has not altered this standard and "does not directly provide the authority for a petitioner to expand the record in order to further develop facts that could have been presented in the state court proceedings." Fielder v. Stevenson, No. 2:12-cv-412-JMC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19769, 2013 WL 593657, at *6 (D.S.C. Feb. 14, 2013). However, as this court and others have recognized, a court may exercise its discretion to expand the record when considering whether cause and prejudice excuse a claim's default. Fielder, No. 2:12-cv-412-JMC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19769, 2013 WL 593657, at *3 (citing Cristin v. Brennan, 281 F.3d 404, 416 (3d Cir. 2002)). Thus, where a petitioner relies on Martinez to show cause and prejudice, a court may find additional evidentiary development necessary to adequately consider whether PCR counsel were deficient and whether prejudice resulted [*165]  from the errors and may exercise its discretion to expand the record to consider new evidence in that context. However, depending on the state court record and the claim raised by the petitioner, it may not be necessary for a court to expand the record because it may be clear that the petitioner cannot succeed in all elements of his Martinez claim.
As discussed above, Bixby has not supported this ground with adequately alleged facts to even suggest that full factual development might entitle him to habeas relief. The burden is on the petitioner to show, in his filings, that his defaulted claims have some merit. For this purpose and in accordance with Martinez, Juniper,30 and Gray,31 this court appoints highly qualified, independent counsel and routinely allots time and resources for their investigation and development of potential Martinez claims.
In this case, the undersigned has granted multiple extensions and has provided counsel ample time to fully investigate this claim and obtain pertinent affidavits or other extra-record evidence, which could have been attached to the Petition, Full Petition, Supplemental Memorandum, or Petitioner's Traverse to support this claim's substantiality. [*166]  See, e.g., Owens v. Stirling, 0:16-cv-02512, Am. Pet., ECF No. 117, Add'l Attachs., Doc. #163, 176 (attaching twenty-one documents to the Amended Petition, including affidavits regarding ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and adding evidentiary support to the Amended Petition after the court lifted the stay). However, without any evidentiary support, the court is left with only the record,32 a discussion of how other courts have applied the ADA to arrests or interrogations, and conclusory assertions that the ADA is applicable to this case. This is not enough to show entitlement to either discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, the undersigned denies Bixby's requests as to both.

Miscellaneous Grounds
In his original petition, Bixby alleged three grounds that do not explicitly appear in the "Full Petition":
(25) The State of South Carolina currently does not have a means of actually imposing the death penalty on Bixby that is consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the United States Constitution.
. . . .
(28) Trial counsel failed to sufficiently investigate or effectively raise and appellate counsel failed to adequately brief issues of Petitioner's extreme religious, ideological, psychological, and sociological indoctrination [*167]  throughout childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood which contributed overwhelmingly to his mental functioning at the time of the crime.
(29) Trial counsel failed to sufficiently investigate or effectively raise and appellate counsel failed to adequately brief issues concerning Bixby's extreme frostbite suffered while working and living in New Hampshire and how this effected and continues to effect Petitioner's mental and physical health, and how it may have severely impaired his mental functioning at the time of the crime and at present.
(Doc. #72 at 6-7.) Respondents assert these grounds were not considered by the state courts so they are not available for habeas review and they have been abandoned. (See Doc. #83 at 5, 33, 106-15.)
As to Bixby's claim that South Carolina lacks a constitutional means of execution, the undersigned finds no record that Bixby has raised this claim to the state courts and must, therefore, agree with Respondents that the claim is procedurally defaulted. Bixby has not briefed this claim and, thus, has not asserted cause and prejudice for excusing the default. Further, based solely on the vague and conclusory heading above, the undersigned could not decide [*168]  this claim on the merits even if permitted to do so.
Regarding claims (28) and (29), Bixby did not include either as a claim or a ground in the "Full Petition." Supporting information for both is included in the background section of the PCR post-hearing brief and, consequently, the Petition. However, because Bixby did not present those facts to the state courts as claims, they have not been properly exhausted as such. Further, to the extent Bixby is challenging trial counsels' mitigation investigation and presentation in these claims, the undersigned has already considered the PCR court's related findings in Ground I.
Claims (28) and (29) also raise ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The only ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim raised to the state courts involved the allegations in habeas Ground III and addressed by the undersigned in its discussion of that ground. Thus, this portion of claims (28) and (29) is clearly defaulted.

CONCLUSION
As set out above, a review of the record indicates that the petition should be dismissed. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that Respondents' motion for summary judgment (doc. #84) be granted and the Petition dismissed without an [*169]  evidentiary hearing.
Respectfully submitted,
/s/ Thomas E. Rogers, III
