Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Felicia Kelso ("Plaintiff") raises claims of discrimination, retaliation, and a hostile work environment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act ("Title VII"), Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act ("Rehabilitation Act"), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ("ADEA") against employer, Sonny Perdue, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("Defendant"). See ECF No. 1 (Compl.). United States District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan referred this matter to a magistrate judge for full case management, including the preparation of a Report and Recommendation on dispositive motions pursuant to Local Civil Rule 72.3. See Minute Order, Oct. 13, 2020. Defendant has since filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), or in the alternative, a Motion for Summary Judgment under Rule 56(a). See ECF No. 9 (Def.'s MTD). The undersigned recommends that the Court GRANT the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).

I. BACKGROUND [*2] supporting
Plaintiff identifies as a "black/African-American" female over the age of 40. Compl. ¶ 10. Plaintiff was hired in March 2013 as an Executive Assistant/Staff Assistant in the Office of Human Resources Management for the United States Forest Service, within the United States Department of Agriculture. See Def.'s MTD at 1. Plaintiff is a military veteran who suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ("PTSD"), depression, anxiety, chronic migraines, and lumbar strain. See Compl. ¶¶ 11-12. Plaintiff was hired as a "30% disabled compensable veteran." Id. ¶ 6. Plaintiff was employed at the agency until February 2015. See Def.'s MTD at 1.
From March 2013 to January 2014, Plaintiff worked on a schedule of four 10-hour days per week. See id. ¶ 16. Plaintiff was "fully successful" in her position during this period. Id. ¶ 18. On January 8, 2014, Plaintiff suffered a back injury while at work. See id. ¶ 25.

A. Requests for Leave Associated with Back Injury
Plaintiff was on medical leave until March 31, 2014. See id. ¶ 26. A letter from Plaintiff's doctor specified that Plaintiff should be on leave until March 24, 2014, and should receive "reasonable accommodations" upon her return and until April [*3]  7, 2014. Id. ¶ 29. Plaintiff's doctor recommended a work schedule of four hours of telework per day. See id. Accordingly, Plaintiff requested her schedule be adjusted to 7:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. daily. See id. ¶ 36.
Plaintiff's letter did not account for her leave between March 24 and 31, 2014. See id. ¶¶ 29, 34. Defendant warned Plaintiff that she would be charged Absent Without Leave ("AWOL") if she did not provide documentation by April 7, 2014, excusing this absence. See id. ¶ 34. Plaintiff timely supplied the documentation and was not charged AWOL. See id. ¶ 35.
On or about April 7, 2014, Defendant issued a Letter of Instruction. See id. ¶ 38. The Letter of Instruction required Plaintiff to "adhere to normal leave procedures" by submitting a request for leave approval in advance or within a reasonable time if there was an emergency or unplanned sick leave. See id. The Letter of Instruction denied Plaintiff's request to telework full-time, stating that her doctor cannot direct telework. See id. ¶ 39. The Letter of Instruction authorized Plaintiff's request to have a schedule of 7:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. See Def.'s MTD, Ex. A (Pagán Decl.) at 220. However, Plaintiff contends that on [*4]  April 9, 2014, Defendant denied her requested work schedule of 7:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. and told her she had to choose a start time between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. See Compl. ¶ 42.

B. Request for "Stress Break"
On April 28, 2014, Plaintiff requested leave from May 12 to 14, 2014 for a "stress break." Id. ¶ 43. Plaintiff's supervisor, Mary Beth Lepore, denied this request because Lepore was traveling on those days and needed Plaintiff in the office. See id. ¶ 44.
From May 12 to 13, 2014, Plaintiff was "genuinely sick" and took leave. Id. ¶ 45. Plaintiff only informed an Administrative Support Assistant who relayed the message to Plaintiff's supervisors. Id. Plaintiff failed to contact her supervisors directly because she was having "connectivity issues" and her supervisors were not in the D.C. office. Id. ¶ 46. Plaintiff believed that it was acceptable for employees to ask another employee to connect with a supervisor on their behalf in "emergency" situations. Id. ¶¶ 48, 51. Lepore charged Plaintiff AWOL for these two days because Plaintiff did not follow the proper procedures for calling in sick and did not have advance leave. See id. ¶ 47. Plaintiff states that she was charged for two [*5]  8-hour days even though she was working 4-hour days, and thus was charged in excess. See id. ¶ 49. Defendant responds that it subsequently corrected this error. See Def.'s MTD at 4 n.6.

C. Letter of Reprimand
On May 19, 2014, Lepore issued Plaintiff a Letter of Reprimand that alleged Plaintiff had failed to complete "some" work assignments since 2013. Id. ¶ 53. Plaintiff states that the allegations were false. See id. ¶ 54.

D. Change of Job Duties
Plaintiff took extended medical leave from May 21 through November 30, 2014. See id. ¶ 57. In November 2014, Lepore hired Nicole Lovering, a white woman in her 30s with no known disabilities, to fill the need for a full-time administrative assistant in Plaintiff's absence. See id. ¶ 58. Upon Plaintiff's return, Plaintiff began reporting to Mario Troncoso in the Albuquerque office instead of to Lepore. See id. ¶ 59. Around December 4, 2014, Plaintiff learned that Lovering would be taking over Lepore's calendar and travel management and would be the point of contact for Human Resources in Washington, D.C. See id. ¶ 67. Plaintiff understood that Lepore reassigned these duties because it was "very important that there be consistency and someone daily, [*6]  routinely handling the most critical duties." Id. ¶ 65. Plaintiff claims she could have continued to perform these duties remotely. See id. ¶ 66. Plaintiff's duties were reduced to making copies, dropping off packets for signatures, and researching a menu for a team retreat. See id. ¶ 69.

E. Request for Reasonable Accommodations from Troncoso
On November 24, 2014, Plaintiff requested to return to the hours she had before her January 2014 back injury. See id. ¶ 60. Troncoso denied this request, stating that Plaintiff's schedule had to "mimic Lepore's." Id. ¶ 60. On December 12, 2014, Plaintiff requested medical leave for an appointment. See id. ¶ 71. On December 15, 2014, Troncoso asked whether the medical appointment was for her work injury, whether she would need an appointment every week, if there was a medical update from her last visit, and if there were any changes from the doctor to her work conditions. Id. ¶ 73-75.
On December 22, 2014, Plaintiff requested 80 hours of advanced sick leave for "rehabilitation and recovery medical treatment" from Troncoso. Id. ¶¶ 81, 89. On January 12, 2015, Plaintiff re-sent her request to Troncoso who had not replied. Id. ¶ 89. Troncoso responded [*7]  and agreed to "move [the request] along." Id. ¶ 90. Troncoso ultimately "did not recommend approval of Plaintiff's advance sick leave request." Id. ¶ 93. Thus, Plaintiff took leave without pay ("LWOP") for this request. Id. ¶ 92.
In late December 2014, Plaintiff requested sick leave for a migraine. See id. ¶ 83. Troncoso responded by "remind[ing Plaintiff] of the call-in procedures" to properly request leave. Id. Plaintiff further stated that Troncoso would "become angry" when she took time off work, even though he knew about her appointments. Id. ¶ 84.

F. Requests to Telework for Inclement Weather
In January 2015, Plaintiff requested unscheduled telework due to inclement weather three times. See id. ¶¶ 103, 111, 118. On January 14, 2015, Troncoso refused Plaintiff's telework request, but Troncoso approved Lovering's similar request. See id. ¶¶ 104, 106. On January 26, 2015, Troncoso again denied Plaintiff's request to telework due to inclement weather. See id. ¶¶ 107-08. Troncoso told Plaintiff that telework was only permissible when there were tasks that could be accomplished remotely. See id. ¶ 108. Lovering again received permission to telework. See id. ¶ 110. On January 27, Troncoso [*8]  denied Plaintiff's third inclement weather telework request. See id. ¶ 111. Troncoso told Plaintiff that she did not have an "ad hoc" telework agreement and that he would consider approving her request once she completed her outstanding tasks. Id. ¶ 112.

G. Interpersonal Experience with Lepore and Troncoso
Plaintiff states that upon her return to work in early December 2014, "Lepore said no more than 30 words to Plaintiff and avoided interactions with her." Id. ¶ 63. Plaintiff also alleges that Lepore ignored Plaintiff's greetings like "good morning" and made Plaintiff feel "ostracized, disliked, stressed, and anxious." Id. ¶ 64. Plaintiff claims that the harassment was "severe and pervasive" and caused her to take leave from December 5 to 12, 2014. Id. ¶ 70.
In a January 12, 2015 meeting, Plaintiff states that Troncoso treated her in a "belittling manner" by mocking her response to a question. Id. ¶ 95. After the meeting, Troncoso accused Plaintiff of having "checked out" body language. Id. ¶ 96.
On January 21, 2015, Lepore emailed Plaintiff, Lovering, Troncoso, and others, and stated Plaintiff's work did not "make sense" and was "not helpful." Id. ¶ 118. Plaintiff claimed she "was humiliated" [*9]  by this email. Id. ¶ 119.
On January 28, 2015, Lepore emailed Plaintiff and Troncoso alleging that Plaintiff had poor job performance and behavior. Id. ¶ 120. Lepore stated that Plaintiff appeared "discontent and sullen," that Lepore was concerned about Plaintiff's attendance, and that Plaintiff was expected to be in the office to receive and deliver documents in a "pleasant responsive manner." Id.
On February 2, 2015, Plaintiff went on leave "due to exacerbation of her PTSD, anxiety, [and] depression," caused by what Plaintiff describes as "Defendant's ongoing discriminatory and retaliatory harassment." Id. ¶ 121.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court must grant a motion to dismiss when the complaint "fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). A plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted when her complaint does not allege sufficient facts to make the claim to relief "plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). While a plaintiff "need not establish a prima facie case" [*10]  to survive a motion to dismiss, courts can "explore a plaintiff's prima facie case" to determine whether relief could ever be granted on the stated facts. Redmon v. U.S. Capitol Police, 80 F. Supp. 3d 79, 86 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Hutchinson v. Holder, 668 F. Supp. 2d 201, 211-12 (D.D.C. 2009)). Moreover, the stated facts must provide "more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986)).
In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must assume the complaint's factual allegations are true and must grant the plaintiff the "benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged." Hettinga v. United States, 677 F.3d 471, 476, 400 U.S. App. D.C. 218 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Schuler v. United States, 617 F.2d 605, 608, 199 U.S. App. D.C. 23 (D.C. Cir. 1979)). Courts are not, however, required to accept as true a "legal conclusion couched as factual allegation." Papasan, 478 U.S. at 286.
In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court relies on the complaint itself, which may include "documents attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint." Ward v. D.C. Dep't of Youth Rehab. Servs., 768 F. Supp. 2d 117, 119 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting Gustave—Schmidt v. Chao, 226 F. Supp. 2d 191, 196 (D.D.C. 2002)).
If the court must consider materials outside of the pleadings, it must convert the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). Yet, a document that a complaint "incorporate[s] by reference" can be considered without making such conversion. Banneker Ventures, LLC v. Graham, 798 F.3d 1119, 1133, 418 U.S. App. D.C. 398 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Ultimately, courts maintain discretion in deciding when to convert. See Search v. Uber Techs., Inc., 128 F. Supp. 3d 222, 228 (D.D.C. 2015).
Conversion to a motion for summary judgment [*11]  is generally inappropriate before the plaintiff has been given an adequate opportunity to conduct discovery. See McWay v. LaHood, 269 F.R.D. 35, 39 (D.D.C. 2015). It is often the case that evidence critical to a plaintiff's case is in the possession of the defendant. See Id. at 38-39. Under Rule 12(d), "[a]ll parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). In discrimination cases, motions for summary judgment should be viewed with "special caution" because of the difficulty of proving discrimination. McWay, 269 F.R.D. at 37-38.

III. ANALYSIS
Plaintiff raised seven claims which can be categorized as follows: A) discrimination based on race, disability, and age under Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA; B) retaliation under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act; C) failure to accommodate Plaintiff's disability under the Rehabilitation Act; and D) hostile work environment under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. See Compl. ¶¶ 126-146.
Because the Court reaches its decision to dismiss based on the pleadings alone, conversion to summary judgment is not considered.

A. Discrimination under Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADEA
"Under Title VII, the ADEA, and the Rehabilitation Act, the two essential elements [*12]  of a discrimination claim are that (i) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action (ii) because of the plaintiff's race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability." Baloch v. Kempthorne, 550 F.3d 1191, 1196, 384 U.S. App. D.C. 85 (D.C. Cir. 2008). An adverse employment action is one that causes a "significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits." Sharpe v. Bair, 580 F. Supp. 2d 123, 131 (D.D.C. 2008) (quoting Broderick v. Donaldson, 437 F.3d 1226, 1233, 369 U.S. App. D.C. 374 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). Most cases involve "direct economic harm." Walden v. Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Inst., 304 F. Supp. 3d 123, 133 (D.D.C. 2018) (quoting Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 761, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998)). While there can be an adverse employment action without quantifiable losses, "not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action." Id. at 133 (quoting Russell v. Principi, 257 F.3d 815, 818, 347 U.S. App. D.C. 222 (D.C. Cir. 2001)). "Purely subjective injuries, such as dissatisfaction with a reassignment, or public humiliation or loss of reputation, are not adverse actions." Forkkio v. Powell, 306 F.3d 1127, 1130-31, 353 U.S. App. D.C. 301 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (internal citations omitted).
Plaintiff's discrimination claims are based on: (a) denial of telework; (b) denial of Plaintiff's preferred schedule; (c) a charge of AWOL; (d) receipt of the Letter of Instruction and Letter of Reprimand; (e) reassignment of duties to Nicole Lovering; and (f) interpersonal issues with supervisors. Plaintiff fails to state that an adverse employment [*13]  action took place under these facts.1
a. Denial of Telework
"[D]enial of a request to telework, without more, does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action, as it does not involve hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits." Redmon, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 87 (internal quotations omitted). Such denial must be more than mere "speculative harm." Id. at 88. Indeed, plaintiffs must allege a concrete and cognizable consequence from the lack of teleworking for any hope of a court finding an adverse action. See id. at 87-88.
Defendant's denials of Plaintiff's telework requests were not adverse employment actions. See id. at 87. First, Plaintiff failed to allege that either the April 2014 or inclement weather denials of telework caused her to lose access to benefits or suffer other consequences. See id. Second, Plaintiff suffered little harm at best, as she was able to "us[e] leave hours," albeit it "unnecessarily" from her perspective, to avoid working in the office. Compl. ¶ 102. Yet from the Court's perspective these options are interchangeable. See Brockman v. Snow, 217 Fed. Appx. 201, 206 (4th Cir. 2007). Third, Plaintiff could not allege concrete harm, as her telework denial was [*14]  limited in scope. See Compl. ¶ 72. She was granted telework on an ad hoc basis on other occasions. See id.; Redmon, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 87 (plaintiff did not suffer an adverse action from denial of telework where she was able to telework on other occasions). Finally, it was immaterial that Defendant granted Lovering telework on days when Plaintiff was not granted telework because courts will not "interfere in every personnel decision." See Brodetski v. Duffy, 141 F. Supp. 2d 35, 44 (D.D.C. 2001).
b. Denial of Plaintiff's Preferred Schedule
A "change in work hours" is not an adverse employment action if the plaintiff suffered no material consequences. Jones v. Bush, 160 F. Supp. 3d 325, 344 (D.D.C. 2016) (one-hour schedule change was not materially adverse). Indeed, a shift change is typically, "a mere inconvenience," which is not "sufficiently adverse to sustain a prima facie case." Brodetski, 141 F. Supp. 2d at 44 (two-hour schedule change was not materially adverse).
Plaintiff claims she was denied a 7:15 a.m. start time and told to choose a start time between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. See Compl. ¶ 42. Plaintiff failed to allege how this change in start time had any materially adverse consequences. At worst, this one hour and 45 minutes shift change may have "cause[d] plaintiff personal inconvenience but it does not rise to the level required to constitute [*15]  an adverse employment action." Brodetski, 141 F. Supp. 2d at 44.
Further, the Letter of Instruction indicated that Defendant granted Plaintiff a 7:15 a.m. start time. See Pagán Decl. at 220. Because Plaintiff "incorporated by reference" the Letter of Instruction into her complaint, the Court can consider it here. See Banneker Ventures, LLC, 798 F.3d at 1133.
Plaintiff further contends that when she returned from extended medical leave in November 2014, her request to resume her pre-injury maxiflex schedule was denied (6:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.). See Compl. ¶ 60. Defendant told Plaintiff that her schedule needed to "mimic Lepore's schedule." Id. Plaintiff again fails to plead how mimicking Lepore's schedule resulted in any materially adverse consequences. Without this Plaintiff again cannot establish an adverse employment action. See Jones, 160 F. Supp. 3d at 344.
c. Charge of AWOL
Placement on AWOL status can constitute an adverse employment action where a plaintiff is deprived of wages to a degree that has a "demonstrable effect involving objectively tangible harm." Greer v. Paulson, 505 F.3d 1306, 1317, 378 U.S. App. D.C. 295 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Brown v. Brody, 199 F.3d 446, 457, 339 U.S. App. D.C. 233 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Where an AWOL charge has only a "negligible impact" on one's income, it is not materially adverse. Rhodes v. Ill. Dep't. of Transp., 359 F.3d 498, 505 (7th Cir. 2004). (rev'd on other grounds). Typically, a one-day AWOL charge falls under this [*16]  category. See id.; Douglas-Slade v. LaHood, 793 F. Supp. 2d 82, 99 (D.D.C. 2011). However, an indefinite placement on AWOL, Greer, 505 F.3d at 1317, or even one to two weeks, see Taylor v. Solis, 571 F.3d 1313, 1321, 387 U.S. App. D.C. 230 (D.C. Cir. 2009), may create sufficient financial harm. At bottom, the plaintiff must plead concrete harm. See Greer, 505 F.3d at 1318.
Plaintiff provides no facts to suggest that the 16-hour2 AWOL charge had more than a "negligible impact" on her salary. Plaintiff did not indicate what her lost wages totaled, nor why such amount was a "serious hardship" to her. Greer, 505 F.3d at 1318. Conversely, plaintiffs with viable claims pled that AWOL caused them to: face "personal bankruptcy;" be at risk of "foreclosure[]" of real properties; have to "borrow [money] for education and [medical] therapy;" and/or be at risk of "jeopardizing her future employment opportunities" from this negative mark on an employment record. Id. Moreover, while it may have been "contrary to company policy" to charge Plaintiff AWOL for these days, that is not a tangible impact courts recognize. Rhodes, 359 F.3d at 505. Without facts to conclude otherwise, a two-day AWOL charge does not amount to objectively tangible harm. Cf. Douglas-Slade, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 99.
d. Receipt of the Letter of Instruction and Letter of Reprimand
A letter of instruction and letter of reprimand are not adverse employment actions where they are not "attached [*17]  to financial harms" and there is no plausible allegation that the letters "could affect [plaintiff's] position, grade level, salary, or promotion opportunities." Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1199. "[J]ob-related constructive criticism" is not tangible harm, whereas letters containing abusive language may be. Id.
Defendant sent the Letter of Instruction to teach Plaintiff how to properly file leave requests and deny her request for telework hours. See Compl. ¶¶ 38-39. Defendant sent the Letter of Reprimand because Plaintiff failed to complete "some" work assignments. Id. ¶ 53. Plaintiff does not allege that either letter resulted in any financial harm or further disciplinary action. See Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1199. Plaintiff also does not state that either letter contained abusive language. Again, without such facts, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate an adverse employment action. See id.
e. Reassignment of Duties to Lovering
A plaintiff "involuntarily reassigned" to a new role or given new responsibilities suffers an adverse employment action where she experiences a reduction in pay or benefits or is given "significantly different responsibilities" that constitute "objectively tangible harm." Sharpe, 580 F. Supp. 2d at 131. A "limited reduction in work responsibilities" does not [*18]  constitute an adverse employment action. Ng v. Lahood, 952 F. Supp. 2d 85, 95 (D.D.C. 2013); see also Rhone v. U.S. Capitol Police, 865 F. Supp. 2d 65, 71 (D.D.C. 2012) (loss of individual responsibility, where plaintiff had to ask permission before signing things, was not an adverse employment action). Furthermore, reassignment to "less prestigious" work is a subjective injury that does not rise to an adverse employment action unless there is also a change of job title or evidence of a non-speculative negative impact on job growth or future employment potential. Casey v. Mabus, 878 F. Supp. 2d 175, 186 (D.D.C. 2012). Only an "extraordinary reduction" in responsibilities, such as a GS-11 being given tasks meant for a GS-5, Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 902, 369 U.S. App. D.C. 122 (D.C. Cir. 2006), or completely "withdrawing an employee's supervisory duties," Stewart v. Ashcroft, 352 F.3d 422, 427, 359 U.S. App. D.C. 139 (D.C. Cir. 2003), can amount to objectively tangible harm.
Plaintiff does not state that she experienced a change in pay, a reduction in grade level, a loss of benefits, or a change of job title. However, Defendant did reduce Plaintiff's job duties to "making copies, dropping off packets for signatures, and . . . research[ing] a menu for the Leadership Retreat," id. ¶ 69, while Lovering took over managing Lepore's calendar and travel and became the primary administrative assistant, see id. ¶ 67. Yet, Plaintiff does not assert that these new tasks were meant for someone "far below" her [*19]  level or that she incurred any material harm from her reduction in duties. Holcomb, 433 F.3d at 903. While Plaintiff likely felt a loss of prestige when Defendant took away what she perceived to be her "most critical" tasks, see Compl. ¶ 65, she does not allege facts to suggest that the harm was more than subjective. How Defendant chose "to apportion less desirable work is a paradigmatic example of [] a business decision, which courts will not review except in extreme circumstances." Nichols v. Truscott, 424 F. Supp. 2d 124, 137 (D.D.C. 2006). Thus, Plaintiff failed to plead an adverse employment action. See Casey, 878 F. Supp. 2d at 186.
f. Interpersonal Issues
Under the adverse employment action standard, feeling singled out, humiliated, mocked, or belittled by a supervisor are subjective injuries that do not rise to the level of "objectively tangible harm." Forkkio, 306 F.3d at 1130-31. Plaintiff alleges facts related to scattered interpersonal issues with her supervisors, including feeling belittled, singled out, and humiliated. See Compl. ¶¶ 64, 76, 95-96, 118-20. However, Plaintiff's facts do not suggest that Plaintiff suffered demonstrable injuries, let alone ones that were objective. These actions therefore do not comprise an adverse employment action. See Forkkio, 306 F.3d at1130-31.

B. Retaliation under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act [*20] 
To prevail on a retaliation claim under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act,3 Plaintiff must show that she (i) engaged in a protected activity, (ii) her employer took a materially adverse action against her, and (iii) that the adverse action was causally connected to Plaintiff's engagement in the protected activity. Taylor, 571 F.3d at 1320. Because there was no materially adverse action, as described below, the Court need not consider the other retaliation factors. See Douglas-Slade, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 97.
Any action that "could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or  a charge of discrimination" is a materially adverse action in the retaliation context. Burlington N. and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 57, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006). Unlike an "adverse employment action" in the discrimination context, a "materially adverse" action in the retaliation context encompasses actions that an employer might take outside the context of work. Wiley v. Glassman, 511 F.3d 151, 161, 379 U.S. App. D.C. 122 (D.C. Cir. 2007). This makes the makes the "materially adverse" action a broader category. See Rochon v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 1211, 1219-20, 370 U.S. App. D.C. 74 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that the FBI's refusal to investigate a death threat was a materially adverse action though not an employment action). However, where the "materially adverse" actions alleged are solely employment actions, the standards are identical for a discrimination and retaliation case. Id. at 1219; see [*21]  also Wiley, 511 F.3d at 157 (analyzing discrimination and retaliation actions under the same standard); Massaquoi v. District of Columbia, 81 F. Supp. 3d 44, 50 (D.D.C. 2015) (same).
Plaintiff alleged the same facts to support her discrimination and retaliation claims. No facts suggest that an action occurred outside of the employment context. Thus, the adverse employment action standard applies equally here. See Rochon, 438 F.3d at 1219. For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff failed to plead an adverse employment action and therefore also fails to state a claim for retaliation. Id.

C. Failure to Accommodate under the Rehabilitation Act
To prevail on a failure to accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate (i) she has a qualified disability under the Act; (ii) her employer had notice of her disability; and (iii) she was denied a request for a reasonable accommodation. See Ward v. McDonald, 762 F.3d 24, 31, 412 U.S. App. D.C. 24 (D.C. Cir. 2014). It is uncontested that Plaintiff had a qualified disability and that her employer knew about her disability. See Def.'s MTD at 1. Only the third element is disputed.
An employer has an affirmative obligation under the Rehabilitation Act to make reasonable accommodations for an employee with a qualified disability unless making the accommodation would impose "undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). An [*22]  employer need not adopt the exact accommodation the employee or their doctor requests. See Aka v. Washington Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1305, 332 U.S. App. D.C. 256 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Rather, "the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation." Id. (quoting Gile v. United Airlines, 95 F.3d 492, 499 (7th Cir. 1996)). An employer is at a minimum obligated to engage in good faith in an "interactive process" to determine an accommodation that works for both the employee and employer. Matos v. DeVos, 317 F. Supp. 3d 489, 496-97 (D.D.C. 2018).
Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to accommodate because (a) she was denied full-time telework; (b) she was denied her preferred hourly schedule; (c) she was denied a maxiflex schedule; and (d) she was placed on LWOP status for 80 hours.
a. Denial of Full-Time Telework
Requests for full-time telework need not be granted if the employee needs to be in the office "at least some of the time" to perform the essential functions of their position. Matos, 317 F. Supp. 3d at 500. Essential functions are the "fundamental duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds." McNair v. District of Columbia, 11 F. Supp. 3d 10, 15 (D.D.C. 2014) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1)). Wide deference is given to the employer on what an employee's "essential functions" are and whether the employee could perform those functions from home. Id.
While Plaintiff stated that "most" of her duties could be performed remotely, Compl. ¶ 22, she conceded that not [*23]  all of her duties could be performed remotely. See id. ¶ 21. Plaintiff acknowledged that part of her role entailed being a "frontline greeter" for guests when Lepore was at the D.C. office, which was 50% of the time. Id. Plaintiff further stated that part of her duties included "making copies" and "dropping off packets for signatures," which was also in-person work. Id. ¶ 69. Thus, Defendant could not grant Plaintiff's request for full-time telework as many of her essential functions required her to be in person.4 See Matos, 317 F. Supp. 3d at 500.
b. Denial of Plaintiff's Preferred Hourly Schedule
Denial of an employee's preferred hourly schedule is not a failure to accommodate where the employer offers an alternative schedule that accommodates the employee. See Gile v. United Airlines, 95 F.3d 492, 499 (7th Cir. 1996). Even if Defendant denied Plaintiff her preferred start time of 7:15 a.m.,5 Defendant still gave the option of starting a mere 45 minutes later. Compl. ¶ 42. Plaintiff does not allege any facts to suggest that the 8:00 a.m. start time was not a reasonable accommodation or that she refused this option. Where there is no denial of a proposed accommodation, there is no failure to accommodate. See Flemmings v. Howard Univ., 198 F.3d. 857, 862, 339 U.S. App. D.C. 110 (D.C. Cir. 1999).
c. Denial of a Maxiflex Schedule in November—December [*24]  2014
Fundamental to a failure to accommodate claim is that the "plaintiff-employee has requested an accommodation which the defendant-employer has denied." Flemmings, 198 F.3d. at 861. While there is no requirement to put the request in writing or to use the words "reasonable accommodation," a plaintiff must make clear that her request is related to her disability. Badwal v. Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of D.C., 139 F. Supp. 3d 295, 313 (D.D.C. 2015).
Plaintiff requested to return to her pre-injury maxiflex schedule. See Compl. ¶ 60. Plaintiff pled no facts to suggest, however, that she "made clear that she wanted assistance with her disability so that she may return, or continue, to work." Badwal, 139 F. Supp. 3d at 313 (cleaned up). Plaintiff also failed to plead that she told Defendant that her request was related to her disability. Defendant's denial of this request was therefore not a denial of a request for a reasonable accommodation based on Plaintiff's disability.
d. 80 Hours of LWOP
A person taking unapproved leave likely will be "placed on AWOL rather than [LWOP]." Williams v. Donovan, 219 F. Supp. 3d 167, 178 (D.D.C. 2016). Indeed, plaintiffs request LWOP as a "reasonable accommodation" in lieu of being placed on AWOL. Kelso v. Paulson, 3:08-cv-961, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51602, 2010 WL 2163124, at *2 (N.D. Tex. May 4, 2010). Typically, "granting LWOP is discretionary."6 Fall v. Donley, 08-cv-4118, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69619, 2010 WL 2773340, at *13 (W.D. Mo. July 13, 2010).
Plaintiff states that Defendant's "failure to process Plaintiff's [*25]  [December 22, 2014] request for [80 hours of advance sick] leave resulted in her taking [LWOP]." Compl. ¶¶ 92. Plaintiff fails to plead any facts to suggest why this grant of LWOP status was anything other than a grant of a reasonable accommodation. See Kelso, 3:08-cv-961 at *2 (N.D. Tex. May 4, 2010). While perhaps not the accommodation Plaintiff was looking for, Defendant's granting of LWOP was still "some reasonable accommodation" which benefited Plaintiff. Aka, 156 F.3d at 1305.

D. Hostile Work Environment under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act
To prevail on a hostile work environment claim under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act, "a plaintiff must show that [her] employer subjected [her] to discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1201 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys. Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)) (cleaned up). To determine if an employee was subjected to "severe and pervasive" conduct, "the court looks to the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, its offensiveness, and whether it interferes with an employee's work performance." Id. Conduct must [*26]  be objectively offensive to "a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position," not merely subjectively offensive to the plaintiff. Casey, 878 F. Supp. 2d at 189 (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998)).
"The Supreme Court has been clear that Title VII does not establish a 'general civility code for the American workplace.'" Id. (quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80). Conduct that amounts to "ordinary tribulations of the workplace" does not create a hostile work environment claim. Buie v. Berrien, 85 F. Supp. 3d 161, 180 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998)).
"[D]ismissive" behavior from a supervisor also falls in the category of ordinary tribulations. Johnson v. Bolden, 699 F. Supp. 2d 295, 302 (D.D.C. 2010). Plaintiff stated that, "Lepore said no more than 30 words to Plaintiff and avoided interactions with her," Compl. ¶ 63, and that Lepore ignored Plaintiff's greetings such as "good morning," id. ¶ 64. While perhaps dismissive, this behavior was not severe or pervasive. See Johnson, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 302.
Ordinary tribulations also include "rude comments, unjust criticism, and stressful working conditions." Richard v. Bell Atl. Corp., 209 F. Supp. 2d 23, 35 (D.D.C. 2002). Plaintiff relied on a few interactions with Troncoso: Troncoso asked her about her medical appointments and meeting with a lawyer, see Compl. ¶¶ 72-76; Troncoso would "become angry" when she requested time off, id. ¶ 84; Troncoso "mocked her response" to a question in a meeting in a "belittling manner," id. ¶ 95; [*27]  and Troncoso accused her of having "checked out body language," id. ¶ 96. Plaintiff also raised an email with a criticism including "this doesn't make sense" and "this is not helpful," id. ¶ 118, and a second email stating she had exhibited poor job performance and appeared "discontent and sullen," id. ¶ 120. This was at most "obnoxious discourtesies," Casey, 878 F. Supp. 2d at 189, such as a supervisor commenting that "a fifth grader could do [plaintiff's] job," which is insufficient to reach the level of severe conduct, Buie, 85 F. Supp. 3d at 180. This "behavior [was not] so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victim's employment." Casey, 878 F. Supp. 2d at 189 (quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 81) (cleaned up). Moreover, these handful of comments/emails did not rise to the "frequency of the discriminatory" conduct needed to be pervasive. Id. (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 23).
Although Plaintiff makes various conclusory statements that the conduct she faced was "severe and pervasive" or "discriminatory and retaliatory harassment," Compl. ¶¶ 70, 121, the Court will not accept as true this legal conclusion presented as a factual allegation. See Trudeau v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 456 F.3d 178, 193, 372 U.S. App. D.C. 335 (D.C. Cir. 2006). "Although the conduct alleged by the plaintiff may have been offensive, it cannot be reasonably inferred from the plaintiff's allegations that the defendant's [*28]  conduct meets the demanding standard articulated by the Supreme Court." Casey, 878 F. Supp. 2d at 189.
