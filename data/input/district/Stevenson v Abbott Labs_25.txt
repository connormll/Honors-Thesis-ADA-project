ORDER GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANT [34]
Before the Court is Defendants Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Products, Inc., and Abbott Products, LLC's (together, "Abbott's") Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion" or "Mot.") (Dkt. 34). Having considered the moving papers, opposition, reply, and all exhibits attached thereto, the Court [*2]  hereby GRANTS the Motion in its entirety.

I. BACKGROUND

A. Elizabeth Stevenson's Work History
In 2002, Elizabeth Stevenson ("Ms. Stevenson") began working as a Pharmaceutical Sales Representative at Solvay Pharmaceuticals. Decl. of Jon Klinghoffer ("Klinghoffer Decl."), Ex. A ("Pl.'s Dep.") 32:3-7; 33:4-25. In February 2010, Abbott acquired Solvay Pharmaceuticals, at which point, Ms. Stevenson became an employee of Abbott. Decl. of Jennifer Widrick ("Widrick Decl.") ¶ 3; Pl.'s Dep. 32:3-7.
Ms. Stevenson was a Senior Sales representative, marketing prescription drugs to healthcare providers in the Santa Ana, California area. Pl.'s Dep. 36:21-24; 37:23-38:8.

B. Abbott's Short-Term Disability Policy
During the time that Ms. Stevenson was employed with Abbott, Abbott had in place a Short-Term Medical Leave ("STML") Policy. Decl. of Jennifer Widrick ("Widrick Decl.") ¶ 8. The STML Policy provided job protection and 100% base pay for up to 26 weeks, at which point employees were permitted to apply for Extended Disability Plan benefits. Widrick Decl., Ex. D at 7. It also provided that "[i]f the employee [was] not able to perform all of the essential functions of the job, or need[ed] an accommodation, [*3]  Abbott [would] work with the employee and the Manager/Supervisor to identify available accommodations." Id. at 10.
The STML Policy also provided that, "[i]f an employee d[id] not return to work prior to the end of one (1) year of total leave time (which includes all types of leave), the employee [would] be separated from the Company." Id. at 12.

C. Ms. Stevenson's Leaves of Absence
For about six months in 2010, Ms. Stevenson was on medical leave for scar tissue forming on her hip. Id. 48:12-49:8. Ms. Stevenson returned to work in November 2010 with certain restrictions, including the use of an Abbott-provided electronic scooter to go to her offsite meetings, a wheeled bag to carry her work materials, a handicap parking permit, and delivery of lunches to customers, instead of having to carry the lunches herself. Id. 126:15-127:14.
On January 20, 2011, Ms. Stevenson was involved in a car accident. Id. 49:9-25; 70:25-71:2. Ms. Stevenson filed for worker's compensation benefits and signed an authorization for Abbott "to be furnished any information and data regarding the injury or illness, including reports, records, x-rays, results of diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, estimate[] of disability, and recommendations [*4]  for further treatment." Id. 83:8-24.
Eight days after the accident, Ms. Stevenson was released to work with a light duty restriction. Id. ¶ 75:3-21; Decl. of Dr. Jamie Lewis ("Lewis Decl.") ¶ 4, Ex. A. The next day, Ms. Stevenson returned to her doctor's office and was deemed temporarily totally disabled through February 4, 2011. Pl.'s Dep. 76:21-77:1; 77:22-78:3; Lewis Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A.
On February 24, 2011, Ms. Stevenson returned to the doctors' office, and was deemed temporarily totally disabled until March 4, 2011. Lewis Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A. On March 3, 2011, Ms. Stevenson was released to work with restrictions, limiting her to sedentary work for two hours a day. Id. Pursuant to its medical leave policy, Abbott accommodated Ms. Stevenson's restrictions.
On March 10, 2011, Ms. Stevenson visited the doctor's office again and was "[i]nstructed to return to work at once with no limitations."1 Lewis Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A; Pl.'s Dep. 90:10-16. At this point, Ms. Stevenson believed that Abbott would be willing to return her to her previous position. Pl.'s Dep. 170:6-10.
But, Ms. Stevenson believed she was still physically unable to work. Id. 92:1-4. She did not understand why the doctor refused to [*5]  continue treating her, and so she called her workers' compensation attorney. Id. 93:2-15. The attorney referred her to a new doctor, Dr. James Styner ("Dr. Styner"). Id. After visiting Dr. Styner on March 21, 2011, he declared that Ms. Stevenson's status of "total temporary disability" was extended by four weeks, and she was ordered to return for an appointment on April 18, 2011 Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 30. When she returned for her next appointment, Dr. Styner extended her status for another six weeks, and set the next appointment for June 1, 2011. Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 31. When she returned, Dr. Styner extended her status for another six weeks, and set an appointment for June 27, 2011. Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 32. When she returned, Dr. Styner extended her status for another six weeks, and set an appointment for August 8, 2011. Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 33.

D. Ms. Stevenson Exhausts Her Short Term Medical Leave
By August 2, 2011, Ms. Stevenson exhausted her 26 weeks of job protection and medical leave pay. Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 34. On August 8, 2011, Dr. Styner instructed Ms. Stevenson to remain off work for another six weeks. Klinghoffer Decl., Ex. C ("Styner Dep.") 26:22-28:17.
In a letter dated August 9, 2011, Abbott informed [*6]  Ms. Stevenson that her job protection and STML benefits expired on August 2, 2011. Pl.'s Dep. 105:9-12. The letter further explained that, "[i]f at any time you feel there is anything that Abbott can do to assist with your return to work, please let us know." Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 34. Ms. Stevenson understood this letter as meaning "that if [she] didn't return to work by August 2, that [her] position may no longer be available." Pl.'s Dep. 105:9-12.
However, Ms. Stevenson believed she was still unable to return to work. Pl.'s Dep. 103:20-104:1. At her next appointment with Dr. Styner, on September 19, 2011, Ms. Stevenson's status as temporarily totally disabled was extended for another six weeks. Id. 114:1-13.

E. Abbott Fills Ms. Stevenson's Position
Beginning in at least late July, Abbott considered whether to fill Ms. Stevenson's position. See Pl.'s Notice of Lodging, Ex. 11. In emails dated July 22, 2013, supervisors explained that they were "pretty confident that [Ms. Stevenson] w[ould] not come back" and that there was not an expected date for her return."2 Id.
In August 2011, Samantha Saiki ("Ms. Saiki"), a sales representative serving the Anaheim area, inquired about openings in the [*7]  Santa Ana area. Klinghoffer Decl., Ex. E ("Saiki Dep.) 28:11-29:5. At the time, she was told there were no openings.3 Id. Eventually, Ms. Saiki was interviewed for the Santa Ana position in late September or early October, and she was offered the position in early October. Klinghoffer Decl., Ex. D ("Merdalo Dep.") 116:5-17.
Following an appointment on October 31, 2011, Dr. Styner released Ms. Stevenson to return to regular work on November 1, 2011. Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 44. On that day, Ms. Saiki began her new job in Ms. Stevenson's old position. Notice of Lodging, Ex. 6.

F. Ms. Stevenson Is Placed on a Personal Leave of Absence and Attempts to Find a New Position Within Abbott
On November 1, 2011, Abbott informed Ms. Stevenson that her former position was no longer available. Klinghoffer Decl., Ex. B ("Gutek Dep.") 21:25-26:1. The next day, Ms. Stevenson was placed on an unpaid personal leave of absence. Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 12.
Under Abbott's Personal Leave of Absence Policy, Ms. Stevenson was permitted to apply for jobs posted on the internal Abbott job board for displaced employees. Pl.'s Dep. 45:11-13; 121:6-21. During this time, Ms. Stevenson was also in contact with Jensen Shirley ("Mr. Shirley"), [*8]  Abbott's diversity manager. Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 54-56. Ms. Stevenson inquired about job openings in the Long Beach and Orange County areas, and Mr. Shirley encouraged Ms. Stevenson to apply to two job openings, although they "d[id] not specifically mention the Long Beach or Orange County areas[.]" Id.
Ms. Stevenson's personal leave of absence ended on February 1, 2012 and she had not been able to find another position. Gutek Dep. 225:3-19. Her employment was terminated. Id.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is proper if "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is to be granted cautiously, with due respect for a party's right to have its factually grounded claims and defenses tried to a jury. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The court must view the facts and draw inferences in the manner most favorable to the non-moving party. United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1992); Chevron Corp. v. Pennzoil Co., 974 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1992). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact for trial, but it need not disprove the other party's case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. When the non-moving party bears the burden of proving the claim or defense, the moving party can meet its burden [*9]  by pointing out that the non-moving party has failed to present any genuine issue of material fact as to an essential element of its case. See Musick v. Burke, 913 F.2d 1390, 1394 (9th Cir. 1990).
Once the moving party meets its burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to set out specific material facts showing a genuine issue for trial. See Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248-49. A "material fact" is one which "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law . . . ." Id. at 248. A party cannot create a genuine issue of material fact simply by making assertions in its legal papers. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense v. Walter Kidde & Co., Inc., 690 F.2d 1235, 1238 (9th Cir. 1982). Rather, there must be specific, admissible evidence identifying the basis for the dispute. Id. The court need not "comb the record" looking for other evidence; it is required only to consider evidence set forth in the moving and opposing papers and the portions of the record cited therein. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); Carmen v. S.F. Unified Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2001). The Supreme Court has held that "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence . . . will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for [the opposing party]." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252.

III. ANALYSIS

A. Failure to Accommodate
Under FEHA, it is unlawful "for an employer . . . to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an . . . employee." [*10]  Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m). A "reasonable accommodation" involves "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." Cal. Gov. Code § 12926(n)(2).

1. Medical Leave
"Holding a job open for a disabled employee who needs time to recuperate or heal is in itself a form of reasonable accommodation and may be all that is required where it appears likely that the employee will be able to return to an existing position at some time in the foreseeable future." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000) (emphasis added) (citing Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999)). But, "[r]easonable accommodation does not require the employer to wait indefinitely for an employee's medical condition to be corrected." Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 226-27 (quoting Gantt v. Wilson Sporting goods Co., 143 F.3d 1042, 1047 (6th Cir. 1998)).
It is undisputed that Ms. Stevenson could not perform the job, with or without accommodation, for the period from January to October 2011.4 It is also undisputed that Abbott provided Ms. Stevenson with 26 weeks of paid leave.
Parties disagree on whether Ms. Stevenson's leave was "indefinite." The Court finds that it was. First, each of Dr. Styner's reports extended Ms. Stevenson's leave by four to six weeks, but was silent as to the date on which Ms. Stevenson was expected to return to work. See Pl.'s Dep., Exs. [*11]  30, 31, 32, 33, 39. By contrast, Dr. Styner's final report, dated October 31, 2011 did set a date on which Ms. Stevenson was expected to return to work. Id. Ex. 44. Second, Ms. Stevenson testified that she personally did not know how long she was going to be on medical leave. Pl.'s Dep. 47:24-48:7. In other words, at no point prior to October 31, 2011—approximately nine months after Ms. Stevenson was first diagnosed as temporarily totally disabled—was Abbott informed of Ms. Stevenson's return date. At most, they were informed of the date of Ms. Stevenson's next medical appointment. Therefore, the medical leave was indefinite.
Abbott was not required to keep Ms. Stevenson's position open indefinitely, and it did not violate FEHA by giving the position to Ms. Saiki after Ms. Stevenson had been on 26 weeks of paid leave. See Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 226-27 (medical leave for an indefinite period of time is not a reasonable accommodation).

2. Reassignment
Ms. Stevenson also argues that Abbott failed to accommodate her by failing to find her a new assignment when her 'total disability' status ended.
She cites two cases in support of the proposition that disabled employees are entitled to preferential consideration as to [*12]  reassignment, and that employers have an affirmative duty to reassign a disabled employee: Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 and Spitzer v. Good Guys, 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000). However, both of those cases address the employer's duty to reassign currently disabled employees. In other words, if an employee is partially disabled and can be accommodated by being reassigned to a new position for which she is qualified, then she is entitled to preferential treatment to be reassigned to that new position. See id.
Here, on the other hand, it is undisputed that during Ms. Stevenson's disability, she was "totally disabled" and no reassignment would have accommodated her; therefore, Jensen and Spitzer are inapposite.
Ms. Stevenson goes further to argue that upon her November 1, 2011 return, Abbott failed to accommodate her by failing to secure her a new position. However, it is undisputed that Ms. Stevenson was no longer disabled on November 1, 2011 and, therefore, Abbott did not have a duty to accommodate a disability that did not exist.5
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Abbott on Ms. Stevenson's failure-to-accommodate claim.

B. Failure to Engage in an Interactive Process
"[P]arties must engage in an interactive process regarding the requested accommodation [*13]  and, if the process fails, responsibility for the failure rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 54, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006). However, the "interactive process" requirement applies only when a reasonable accommodation is possible. Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 980, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008).
As explained above, it is undisputed that from January to October 2011, Ms. Stevenson was totally disabled and no accommodation, other than leave, was possible. Furthermore, there is no indication that Ms. Stevenson requested any such accommodation. Therefore, Abbott did not have an obligation to engage in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation for Ms. Stevenson while she was totally disabled. See id.
The next question is whether, after having been reasonably accommodated during her total disability, Ms. Stevenson was entitled to an interactive process when she returned with no disability. Neither party has identified any case law that suggests that such a duty exists. Therefore, the Court finds that Abbott did not have a duty to engage in an interactive process to identify an accommodation for a disability that no longer existed.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Abbott on Ms. Stevenson's interactive process claim. [*14] 

C. Disability Discrimination
Under FEHA, it is unlawful "[f]or an employer, because of the . . . physical disability . . . of any person . . . to discharge the person from employment[.]" Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a). In FEHA disability discrimination cases, courts apply the three-step analysis set out by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).6 Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000); Leatherbury v. C&H Sugar Co., 911 F. Supp. 2d 872, 879-80 (N.D. Cal. 2012).
First, the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. Next, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision. Id. Finally, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer's proffered explanation is merely a pretext for a discriminatory motive. Id. at 804.
A prima facie showing of disability discrimination under FEHA requires the plaintiff to demonstrate: (1) that the plaintiff suffers from a disability; (2) that the plaintiff is otherwise qualified to do this job; and (3) that the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Zivkovic v. So. Cal. Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1090 (9th Cir. 2002); Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007).
Parties dispute whether Ms. Stevenson was qualified to perform the sales representative job, which Ms. Saiki was hired to do in early October 2011. Ms. Stevenson must produce evidence showing that she "was able to [*15]  do the job, with or without reasonable accommodation." Green v. State of California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 262-63, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007).
At the time of the first adverse employment action, July 20117, there is no dispute that Ms. Stevenson was not "qualified." She was totally disabled. In other words, she was not able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation. See Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 234-36, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997). Therefore, she has cannot make a prima facie showing of disability discrimination. Faust, 150 Cal. App. 4th at 886-87.
At the time of the second adverse employment action, February 2012, there is no dispute that Ms. Stevenson no longer suffered from a disability. Therefore, again, she cannot make a prima facie showing of disability discrimination. See id. In addition, the Court finds that, as a matter of law, there is no evidence to support a causal connection between the adverse employment action and any disability that Ms. Stevenson was perceived to have.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Abbott as to Ms. Stevenson's claim of disability discrimination.

D. Wrongful Termination
The parties agree that the wrongful termination claim is entirely predicated on the Court's determinations as to Ms. Stevenson's FEHA claim. See Opp'n at 24-25. Given that the Court finds that, [*16]  as a matter of law, Ms. Stevenson's FEHA claim is unsustainable, the Court likewise GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Abbott as to Ms. Stevenson's wrongful termination claim.

E. Invasion of Privacy
Ms. Stevenson asserted three causes of action for invasion of her medical privacy rights. However, she has not shown that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy.
On January 20, 2011, she signed an authorization for Abbott "to be furnished any information and data regarding the injury or illness, including reports, records, x-rays, results of diagnosis, treatments and prognosis, estimate[] of disability, and recommendations for further treatment." Throughout the briefing, she underscores the fact that Abbott employees had access to documents that referenced her menstrual cycle. However, that information was contained in the documents only because she claimed that the January 2011 car accident caused "menstrual difficulties." Pl.'s Dep., Ex. 15. Ms. Stevenson expressly authorized the release of such documents related to her car accident. Therefore, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Abbott as to Ms. Stevenson's three invasion of privacy causes of action.

F. Unfair Competition [*17]  Law Claim
Abbott moved for summary judgment as to Ms. Stevenson's UCL claim. See Mot. at 22. However, Ms. Stevenson did not respond. See generally Opp'n. Therefore, she has conceded that Abbott is entitled to summary judgment on that claim. See Skinner v. Northrop Grumman Ret. Plan B, No. CV 07-3923, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6591, at *37 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 26, 2010) ("Plaintiffs fail to respond to the Defendants' arguments regarding these claims in their Motion for Summary Judgment, and, thus, have conceded that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on these claims.").
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Abbott as to Ms. Stevenson's UCL claim.

IV. DISPOSITION
For the reasons explained above, the Court GRANTS Abbott's Motion for Summary Judgment as to all of Ms. Stevenson's causes of action.
Abbott is ORDERED to file a proposed judgment conforming to this order on or before April 4, 2014.
DATED: March 21, 2014
