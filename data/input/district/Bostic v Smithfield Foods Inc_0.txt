Opinion



Memorandum & Recommendation
Terry Bostic has sued his former employer, Smithfield Foods, Inc., under the American with Disabilities Act for allegedly barring him from returning to work because of his disability. Compl., D.E. 1; see also Order Granting Mot. Dismiss at 6, D.E. 37 (dismissing Bostic's other claims). Smithfield moved for summary judgment in January 2023, contending that Bostic is not a "qualified individual" under the ADA and that he did not experience any adverse employment action. See Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., D.E. 41. Bostic did not respond. After reviewing the record, the undersigned recommends that the district court grant Smithfield's motion (D.E. 40) and dismiss Bostic's complaint with prejudice.

I. Background
Bostic began working [*2]  for Smithfield as a Material Handler in August 2018. Statement of Material Facts ¶ 9, D.E. 42. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Smithfield developed a "High Risk" leave program, which provided paid leave for employees with increased risk of complications from COVID-19. Id. ¶¶ 14-15. Smithfield also offered a "Might Be At Increased Risk" of COVID-19 leave program. Id. ¶¶ 18-20. This program allowed employees to voluntarily take unpaid leave and return to work at any time. Id.
After undergoing lung surgery, Bostic qualified for Smithfield's "High Risk" program and took paid leave beginning on April 11, 2020. Id. ¶¶ 12-13. He returned to Smithfield on August 3 because his treating physician cleared him for work with no restrictions. Id. ¶ 16. But Bostic's return to work didn't last long—he chose to enter the "Might Be At Increased Risk" program less than a week later. Id. ¶ 17.
While Bostic was on unpaid leave, Smithfield repeatedly informed him that he could return to work at any time. Id. ¶¶ 29-40. And a week before it terminated the "Might Be At Increased Risk" program, Smithfield sent Bostic a letter telling him that he needed to return to work by May 17, 2021—failure to do so would [*3]  be considered a voluntary resignation. Id. ¶¶ 22-23. Bostic never came back to Smithfield, and he never requested ADA accommodation. Id. ¶¶ 21, 26. So Smithfield considered him to have resigned. Id. ¶ 21. In fact, Bostic never returned to work at all—he testified that he has been unable to work for any employer because of his lung problems since he entered Smithfield's "Might Be At Risk" program. Id. ¶¶ 27-28.
In October 2021, Bostic sued Smithfield under both the ADA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Roughly a year later, the court dismissed his Title VII claims for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. Order Granting Mot. Dismiss at 6. Bostic's surviving ADA claim alleges that Smithfield prevented him from returning to work and denied him reasonable accommodation. Compl. ¶ 21. Now, Smithfield asks that the court enter summary judgment against Bostic's remaining claim. Mot. Summ. J., D.E. 40. Bostic did not respond to Smithfield's motion or object to its accompanying statement of material facts.

II. Discussion
Summary judgment is appropriate when an examination of the pleadings, affidavits, and other proper discovery materials before the court demonstrates that [*4]  "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact," thus entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 134 S. Ct. 1861, 1866, 188 L. Ed. 2d 895 (2014). In making this determination, "the nonmoving party's evidence is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in that party's favor." News & Observer Publ'g Co. v. Raleigh-Durham Airport Auth., 597 F.3d 570, 576 (4th Cir. 2010) (quoting Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 552, 119 S. Ct. 1545, 143 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1999)); accord Tolan, 134 S. Ct. at 1866.
The movant carries the initial burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A fact is "material" if proof of its existence or non-existence might affect the outcome of the litigation. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). And a factual dispute is "genuine" if "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. The movant discharges this burden by identifying "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. In response, the non-movant must identify specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 323. In so doing, the non-movant may rely on a verified complaint when allegations therein are based on personal knowledge. Williams v. Griffin, 952 F.2d 820, 823 (4th Cir. 1991). Conclusory allegations and speculation do not suffice. Thompson v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., 312 F.3d 645, 649 (4th Cir. 2002). If the non-movant fails to introduce evidence contradicting a fact supported by the movant's evidence, the court may "consider the fact undisputed for summary [*5]  judgment purposes." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2). If the non-movant fails to meet his burden, summary judgment must be granted. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.
To succeed on a disability discrimination claim under the ADA, an employee must prove three elements. See EEOC v. Stowe-Pharr Mills, Inc., 216 F.3d 373, 377 (4th Cir. 2000). First, he must show that he has a disability. See id. The ADA defines a disability as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
Second, a plaintiff must prove that he is a "qualified individual" under the ADA. See id. The ADA defines a qualified individual as one "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). A job's essential functions are those that "bear more than a marginal relationship to the job at issue." Martinson v. Kinney Shoe Corp., 104 F.3d 683, 686 (4th Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted).
Third, an ADA plaintiff must demonstrate that his employer took adverse action against him because of his disability. Stowe-Pharr Mills, Inc., 216 F.3d at 377. In the disability discrimination context, an adverse employment action is one that adversely "affect[ed] employment or alter[ed] the conditions of the workplace." [*6]  Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 62, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006). Constructive discharge of the type Bostic alleges here can qualify as an adverse employment action. See Holsey v. Armour & Co., 743 F.2d 199, 209 (4th Cir. 1984).
Setting aside the question of Bostic's disability status, he has failed to satisfy the other requirements of an ADA disability discrimination claim.
To begin with, Bostic has not demonstrated that he is a "qualified individual" under the statute. As discussed above, a qualified individual must be able to perform the essential functions of his job with (or without) reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
During his deposition, Bostic testified that he has been completely unable to work since he enrolled in Smithfield's "Might Be At Increased Risk" program. Statement of Material Facts ¶¶ 27-28. The Fourth Circuit has explained that, if a plaintiff admits that he is completely unable to work on account of his disability and fails to request reasonable accommodation, he is not a qualified individual under the ADA. Jessup v. Barnes Grp., Inc., 23 F.4th 360, 365-66 (4th Cir. 2022); Halperin v. Abacus Tech. Corp., 128 F.3d 191, 195-98 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding that a plaintiff was not a qualified individual in part because he admitted in a deposition that he could not return to work for five months). Thus, he cannot establish that he is a qualified individual under the ADA. See Jessup, 23 F.4th at 365-66.
Furthermore, Bostic has not demonstrated that Smithfield [*7]  took an adverse action against him to begin with. When an employer tells an employee that failure to return to work by a certain date will be construed as a voluntary resignation, courts are hesitant to find that the employee faced constructive discharge giving rise to an ADA claim. See, e.g., Matammu v. Cnty. of Fairfax, No. 1:20-cv-1468 (RDA/TCB), 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128185, 2022 WL 2820094, at *9 (E.D. Va. July 19, 2022) ("In light of the undisputed facts on summary judgment, the Court concludes that Plaintiff voluntarily left her employment and that she did not suffer an adverse action."). To show that his employer forced him to resign, a plaintiff must prove that the employer's actions were deliberate and that his working conditions were objectively intolerable. See Lacasse v. Didlake, Inc., 712 F. App'x 231, 239 (4th Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (citing Heiko v. Colombo Sav. Bank, F.S.B., 434 F.3d 249, 262 (4th Cir. 2006)).
Although Bostic alleges that Smithfield "refused to allow [him] to return to work[,]" Compl. ¶ 21, he provides no support for this claim. In fact, the undisputed statement of material facts compels the opposite conclusion—Smithfield repeatedly informed Bostic that he could return to work at any time while he was on "Might Be At Increased Risk" leave. Statement of Material Facts ¶¶ 29-40. And a week before ending the voluntary leave program, Smithfield told Bostic he must return to work by May 17, 2021. But because Bostic [*8]  neither requested ADA accommodation nor returned without accommodation (as his doctor said he could), Smithfield considered him to have resigned voluntarily. Id. ¶¶ 21, 26.
In sum, the undisputed statement of material facts belies Bostic's claim that he could not come back to work. He was required—not forbidden—to return. And Bostic has not provided any facts suggesting that Smithfield's request for him to return was objectively unreasonable. Thus, his decision to resign rather than come back to his position with Smithfield cannot give rise to ADA liability. See Matammu, 2022 WL 2820094, at *9.

III. Conclusion
For the reasons discussed above, the undersigned recommends that the district court grant Smithfield's motion for summary judgment (D.E. 40).
The Clerk of Court must serve a copy of this Memorandum and Recommendation ("M&R") on each party who has appeared in this action. Any party may file a written objection to the M&R within 14 days from the date the Clerk serves it on them. The objection must specifically note the portion of the M&R that the party objects to and the reasons for their objection. Any other party may respond to the objection within 14 days from the date the objecting party serves it on them. The [*9]  district judge will review the objection and make their own determination about the matter that is the subject of the objection. If a party does not file a timely written objection, the party will have forfeited their ability to have the M&R (or a later decision based on the M&R) reviewed by the Court of Appeals.
