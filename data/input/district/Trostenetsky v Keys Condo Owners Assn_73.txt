ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS

I. INTRODUCTION
Defendant The Keys Condominium Owners Association ("Association") moves to dismiss the first through fourth claims for relief of plaintiff Bronya Trostenetsky's First Amended Complaint ("FAC"), alleging violations of federal and state disability laws. Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), the motion is suitable for disposition without oral argument, and the hearing set for December 15, 2017, is vacated. For the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.

II. BACKGROUND1
For thirteen years, Trostenetsky has been a residential tenant of a property ("Property") owned, operated, and leased by the Association. She has a qualified physical "disability" as defined by 28 C.F.R. § 36.104 and Gov. Code § 12926. As a result of her physical condition, Trostenetsky is unable [*2]  to stand or walk independently, and requires a wheelchair. Trostenetsky is unable, due to her disability, to use independently, portions of the Property not designed and/or constructed in compliance with applicable accessibility standards to accommodate disabled persons who require a wheelchair for mobility. The Property is a condominium complex with more than four dwelling units. Trostenetsky alleges that she has been denied equal access with able-bodied persons to several common use areas, specifically: (1) the elevator on the lobby floor, which is accessible only via steps, (2) the front entry and exit to the clubhouse of the Property from the sidewalk, which also requires the use of steps, and (3) the swimming pool, due to the nonfunctionality of the swimming pool lift. Trostenetsky reserves the right to cite additional barriers to access after inspection by her access consultant, per the 9th Circuit's standing standards under Doran v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 524 F.3d 1034, (9th Cir. 2008), Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 631 F.3d 939 (9th Cir. 2011), and the General Order 56 requirements for Northern District of California "ADA" Title III cases.
The Association moves to dismiss, arguing that Trostenetsky fails to state a claim because residential facilities such as the Property are not places of "public [*3]  accommodation." Trostenetsky opposes the motion, on the grounds that portions of the property are open to the public and thus qualify as public accommodations under federal and state law.

III. LEGAL STANDARD
A complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). While "detailed factual allegations are not required," a complaint must have sufficient factual allegations to "state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 566 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible "when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. This standard asks for "more than a sheer possibility that a defendant acted unlawfully." Id. The determination is a context-specific task requiring the court "to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Id. at 679.
A motion to dismiss a complaint under FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in the complaint. See Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v. Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995). Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) may be based on either the "lack of a cognizable legal theory" or on "the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory." UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Shelter Capital Partners LLC, 718 F.3d 1006, 1014 (9th Cir. 2013). When evaluating such a motion, [*4]  the Court must "accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005). When a plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, leave to amend should be granted unless "the complaint could not be saved by any amendment." Gompper v. VISX, Inc., 298 F.3d 893, 898 (9th Cir. 2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

IV. DISCUSSION2
The Association seeks to dismiss Trostenetsky's first through fourth claims for relief on the grounds that a residential facility, including portions where the public may enter, is not considered a place of "public accommodation" under the federal and state statutes giving rise to those claims. Trostenetsky concedes that under the facts asserted in her complaint, the California Health and Safety Act does not apply, and she does not oppose the motion to dismiss her second claim for relief. According to Trostenetsky, she has adequately pleaded the required element of public accommodation with respect to her remaining claims.
Under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), the term "public accommodation" is defined in terms of twelve categories, which include "private entities . . . if the operation of such entities affects [*5]  commerce." 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7). The California Disabled Persons Act ("CDPA") requires individuals with disabilities to be given "full and equal access" to "places of public accommodation, amusement, or resort, and other places to which the general public is invited." Cal. Civ. Code § 54.1(b). The Uhruh Civil Rights Act provides that "[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their . . . disability . . . are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever." Cal. Civ. Code § 51(b). The Act also states that "[a] violation of the right of any individual under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . . . shall also constitute a violation of this section." Cal. Civ. Code § 51(f).
The Association argues that under federal law, apartments and condominiums do not constitute public accommodations within the meaning of the ADA. See Indep. Hous. Servs. of San Francisco v. Fillmore Ctr. Assocs., 840 F. Sup. 1328, 1332 (N.D. Cal. 1993). The district court in Fillmore concluded that the legislative history of the statute "clarifies" that "other place of lodging" under 1442 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(A) does not include residential facilities. Id. at 1344 n.14, citing H.R. Rep. No. 101-485(II), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 383 (1990), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1990 267; see also, Kromenhoek v. Cowpet Bay W. Condo Ass'n, 77 F. Supp. 3d 462, 480 (D.V.I. 2014) (granting summary judgment to defendant condominium [*6]  because there was no evidence that it operated like a hotel). California courts have similarly held that residential facilities such as condominiums are not considered places of public accommodation. See Coronado v. Cobblestone Village Community Rentals, L.P., 163 Cal. App. 4th 831, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 883 (2008) (finding that a residential apartment complex, including the sidewalk/parking lot common area, was not a public accommodation), disapproved on other grounds in Munson v. Del Taco, Inc., 46 Cal. 4th 661, 678, 94 Cal. Rptr. 3d 685, 208 P.3d 623 (2009); Birke v. Oakwood Worldwide, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1540, 1552, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 602 (2009) (finding insufficient evidence existed that the swimming pool and playground constituted a public accommodation under the purview of the ADA); and Carolyn v. Orange Park Cmty. Ass'n, 177 Cal. App. 4th 1090, 1099, 99 Cal. Rptr. 3d 699 (2009) (finding that recreational trails on portions of the condominium "common area" were not a public accommodation.)
In 1992, the Department of Justice issued a response letter to a citizens' request for information regarding whether the ADA applied to the clubhouse at a housing development. Dept. of Justice, Office on the Americans with Disabilities Act, 202-PL-118 (Sept. 11, 1992). The DOJ clarified that "whether the ADA applies to the clubhouse depends on who is entitled to use the clubhouse." On the one hand, "[i]f activities in a clubhouse within a residential complex are intended for the exclusive use of residents and their guests, the facility is considered an amenity of the [*7]  housing development" and not subject to the ADA. On the other, "[i]f the clubhouse facilities and activities are made available to the general public for rental or use, they would be covered by the ADA."
Trostenetsky asserts that because the Association allows members of the general public to participate in yoga classes taught in the clubhouse, that portion of the condominium complex constitutes a public accommodation subject to the requirements of the ADA. See Nicholls v. Holiday Panay Marina, L.P., 173 Cal. App. 4th 966, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 309 (2009) (finding that the defendant's efforts to restrict marina access to members did not make an accommodation non-public because the marina rented slips to the general public). Although Trostenetsky alleges generally that portions of the Property are open to the general public, FAC ¶ 10, the fact that the clubhouse hosts yoga classes attended by non-resident individuals is not apparent from the face of the operative complaint. Given that the Property's lobby elevator, clubhouse, and swimming pool appear to be part of the residential condominium complex where Trostenetsky resides, there is no basis to infer that these facilities are intended for the use of anyone other than residents and their guests. Because Trostenetsky has alleged [*8]  no facts supporting an inference that she was denied access to a place of public accommodation, she has not identified a basis for relief under the ADA.
Trostenetsky argues that her Uhruh Act and CDPA claims survive independent of the ADA claim. According to Trostenetsky, she may proceed with her CDPA claims because the statute covers access to "all housing accommodations" in addition to "public accommodations." The Association responds that under the CDPA "housing accommodations" are defined as real property "that is used or occupied . . . as the home, residence, or sleeping place of one or more human beings," excluding accommodations listed in subsection (a), which refers to public accommodations. As such, the Association claims that "housing accommodations" does not include common areas where individuals do not, strictly speaking, "reside." Although the statute is arguably ambiguous as to the treatment of common spaces within a condominium complex, the inclusion of a "housing accommodations" provision in California law strongly suggests that it was meant to have a broader reach than the ADA. Absent relevant authority indicating that the California legislature intended to impose protections on [*9]  individuals' sleeping quarters but not on common spaces within their residential premises, the logical assumption is that those spaces are within the purview of the CDPA. With respect to the Uhruh Act claim, the California Supreme Court has held that housing associations may fall within the definition of "business establishments of every kind whatsoever" covered by the statute, by virtue of its performance of "all the customary business functions which in the traditional landlord-tenant relationship rest on the landlord's shoulders." O'Conner v. Vill. Green Owners Ass'n, 33 Cal. 3d 790, 791, 662 P.3d 427 (1983). Therefore, even if the elevator, clubhouse, and swimming pool are not public accommodations within the meaning of the ADA, Trostenetsky's Uhruh Act claim is unaffected.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the Association's motion to dismiss Trostenetsky's first claim for relief, for violations of the ADA, and second claim for relief, under the California Health and Safety Code, is granted with leave to amend. The motion is denied as to the third and fourth claims for relief, for violations of the CDPA and the Uhruh Act. If Trostenetsky elects to file an amended complaint, she must do so within thirty days of the date of this order.
IT IS SO ORDERED [*10] .
