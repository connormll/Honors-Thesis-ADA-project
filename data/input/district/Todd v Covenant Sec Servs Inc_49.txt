Opinion



ORDER
This matter is before the Court on cross-motions by the parties for reconsideration [DN 27, DN 28] of the Memorandum Opinion and Order issued December 12, 2018. Fully briefed, this matter is ripe for decision.

Background
Plaintiff, Kevin Todd, brought this lawsuit after he was terminated from his position at Defendant, Covenant Security Services, LTD. On September 1, 2017, Todd filed this current action against Covenant in the Daviess Circuit Court alleging claims of disability-based discrimination pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, age discrimination pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and retaliation. On September 27, 2017, Covenant removed the action from the Daviess Circuit Court to the Western District of Kentucky. In a Memorandum Opinion and Order issued December 12, 2018 [DN 26], this Court [*2]  dismissed Plaintiff's claims of age discrimination and retaliation and denied summary judgment as to Plaintiff's ADA reasonable accommodation claim. With respect to the ADA reasonable accommodation claim, the Court found that a patrol round is an essential function of a Covenant security officer assigned to Kimberly Clark. Additionally, the Court found that there are genuine disputes of material fact as to whether Todd's requested accommodations were reasonable, whether Todd was qualified for the position of security officer pursuant to the ADA, and whether Covenant properly engaged in the interactive process as required by the ADA. Covenant now brings this motion asking the Court to reconsider the portion of its Opinion and Order denying Covenant's summary judgment on the disability-related claims of Todd arguing that providing Todd with a mobility device and/or vehicle would not have allowed him to perform all the inspection activities associated with patrol rounds. In response, Todd objects to Covenant's motion to reconsider and brings a cross-motion to reconsider on the issue of whether patrol rounds are an essential function of the Plaintiff's security position.

Standard of Review [*3] 
The Sixth Circuit recognizes that a district court has authority both under common law and under Rule 54(b) "to reconsider interlocutory orders and to reopen any part of a case before entry of final judgment." Rodriguez v. Tennessee Laborers Health & Welfare Fund, 89 Fed. Appx. 949, 959 (6th Cir. 2004). "Traditionally, courts will find justification for reconsidering interlocutory orders when there is (1) an intervening change of controlling law; (2) new evidence available; or (3) a need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice." Id. (citing Reich v. Hall Holding Co., 990 F. Supp. 955, 965 (N.D. Ohio 1998)); see also United States v. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Gov't, 2008 WL 4490200, *1 (E.D. Ky. Oct. 2, 2008); Edmonds v. Rees, 2008 WL 3820432, at *2 (W.D. Ky. Aug. 13, 2008). A motion to reconsider under Rule 54(b) may not, however, "serve as a vehicle to identify facts or raise legal arguments which could have been, but were not, raised or adduced during the pendency of the motion of which reconsideration [is] sought." Owensboro Grain Co., LLC v. AUI Contr., LLC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18025, 2009 WL 650456, at *2 (W.D. Ky. Mar. 10, 2009) (quoting Jones v. Casey's Gen. Stores, 551 F. Supp. 2d 848, 854-55 (S.D. Iowa 2008)). "Motions for reconsideration are not intended to re-litigate issues previously considered by the Court or to present evidence that could have been raised earlier." Northeast Ohio Coal. for Homeless v. Brunner, 652 F. Supp. 2d 871, 877 (S.D. Ohio 2009). "The moving party has the burden of showing that reconsideration is warranted, and that some harm or injustice would result if reconsideration were to be denied." Pueschel v. National Air Traffic Controllers' Ass'n, 606 F. Supp. 2d 82, 85 (D.D.C. 2009).

Discussion
Applying the above standard, the Court denies both parties' motions to reconsider. The arguments raised in the motions were previously [*4]  advanced by the parties and considered by the Court. Neither the law nor the facts as set forth by the parties have changed since the Court previously ruled on these matters. Finally, the parties have not met their burden of proving that the Court committed a clear error in its earlier decision. A motion to reconsider "is not properly used as a vehicle to re-hash old arguments or to advance positions that could have been argued earlier, but were not." Gray v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98264, 2006 WL 3825066, *2 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 13, 2006) (Rule 59); Rodriguez, 89 Fed. Appx. at 959 (Rule 54). The parties may disagree with the Court's decision, but that is an issue for appeal, not reconsideration.

Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the parties' cross-motions to reconsider the Memorandum Opinion and Order issued December 12, 2018 are DENIED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this matter is referred to the Magistrate Judge for a settlement conference.
