FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
DEBORAH A. BATTS, United States District Judge.
Plaintiff Doris Tse brings claims against Defendant New York University ("NYU") alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"), N.Y. Exec. Law § 296 et seq., and New York City Human Rights Law ("NYCHRL"), N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107. At summary judgment, the Court granted Defendant's motion, but preserved for trial the sole issue of whether NYU provided a reasonable accommodation to Dr. Tse for the period June 1, 2010 to April 4, 2011.1 After a bench trial on the merits and damages, at which the Plaintiff proceeded pro se, based on the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law set forth below, the Court finds that NYU is liable under the ADA, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL for failure to provide reasonable accommodations during the pertinent time period.
I. BACKGROUND
Given the procedural posture of this case, the Court assumes familiarity with the underlying facts. Dr. Tse was an employee of NYU from 1994 until April 4, 2011. [*2]  Beginning in 1999, Dr. Tse served as the Director of the Flow Cytometry Core ("Core") within NYU's Center for AIDS Research ("CFAR"). In 1997, Plaintiff developed severe acute arthritis, and in 1999, she was diagnosed with Lupus. As Director of the Core, Dr. Tse was entitled to various staff under her grant who provided her with the assistance she needed to accommodate her disabilities. However, effective April 1, 2010, Dr. Tse was removed from her position as Core Director.2 CFAR funded Dr. Tse's salary through May 31, 2010. (Trial Ex. 2.) In January 2011, Dr. Tse was notified that she would be terminated from her employment at NYU effective April 4, 2011. Dr. Tse began receiving Long Term Disability benefits ("LTD benefits") on April 5, 2011, and Social Security Disability Insurance benefits ("SSDI benefits") beginning in October 2011.
The Court held a bench trial in this matter on June 13, 14, 15, 23, 27, and July 18, 2016. At trial, the Court heard testimony from six witnesses: Dr. Martin Blaser, former Chair of the Department of Medicine; Nancy Sanchez, Senior Vice President and Vice Dean of Human Resources and Organizational Development and Learning for the NYU Medical Center; [*3]  Reginald Odom, former Vice President of Employee and Labor Relations for the NYU Medical Center; Lucy Cribben, former administrator of the NYU Department of Medicine; Dr. Steven Abramson, Vice Dean for Education, Faculty and Academic Affairs and Chair of the Department of Medicine;3 and Plaintiff Dr. Doris Tse.
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
A. Required Extramural Funding and the Grant Application Process
1. According to NYU policy,
[A]ppointment to a non-tenure position shall be for a definite period of time, not exceeding one academic year unless otherwise specified, and shall automatically terminate at the close of that period unless there is an official notice of renewal. . . . We recommend, however, as a matter of good practice, that three months notice of non-reappointment be given to faculty on the full time Clinician Investigator/Educator and Research/Educator tracks. . . . Since these appointments terminate automatically, it is not necessary to state a reason for non-appointment. The non-appointment, however, cannot be based on unlawfully discriminatory factors, such as gender, race, age or retaliation for exercising protected activities.
(Trial Ex. 13; see also Abramson Tr. 326:2-4 ("[N]on-tenured [*4]  faculty don't have a guarantee of sustained funding. Meaning that you could let a person go with proper notice, with three months.").)4
2. As a non-tenured faculty member, Dr. Tse was required to raise extramural funding ("REF") to support her position. (Tse Tr. 412:19-22.)
3. At NYU, "as a member of the non-tenured research track at the university all your efforts have to be supported by grant support and that grant support could come from grants that you wrote or grants that another member of the faculty wrote that would include your efforts in one form or another that would help support your salary." (Blaser Tr. 17:12-17.)
4. When Dr. Tse was removed from the Core Director position, she lost 65% of her extramural funding, as well as the lab assistants she had been provided under her grant. (Blaser Tr. 50:9-11; Tse Tr. 375:1-4, 382:12-15, 414:1-4; see also Trial Ex. 18 at NYU_THIRDPARY000512.)
5. Dr. Tse learned of her removal from the Core position through a letter from Dr. Fred Valentine, Director of CFAR. Dr. Valentine wrote, in relevant part:
On multiple occasions I have articulated my concerns about your ability to manage the core, but despite these discussions you have been unable [*5]  to successfully perform your duties as Director CFAR flow cytometry core. For this reason . . . your role as director of the CFAR flow cytometry core is terminated as of April 1, 2010. We certainly hope you that you will remain a user of the core and continue to have input into ideas about flow cytometry at the School. Funding for that portion of your salary from CFAR budgets is scheduled to end on May 31. . . . Therefore, you will need to increase the number of hours supported from other sources to maintain full NYU benefits from June first onwards.
(Trial Ex. 2)(emphasis added.)
6. Until Dr. Tse's removal from the Core Director position, she had consistently supported between 81 and 100% of her salary with extramural funding. (Tse Tr. 402:23-403:3, 416:1-15.)
7. By late August 2010, Dr. Tse had 5% of her salary covered by extramural funding. (Trial Ex. 55; Tse Tr. 477:11-14.) Dr. Tse did not learn that her extramural funding had fallen to 5% until she met with Dr. Blaser, Mr. Odom, and Ms. Cribben in August 2010:
Q: Did you meet with Dr. Blaser, Mr. Odom, and Lucy Cribben in August?
A: Yes, we met on August 25th at 12:00 p.m. in a conference room in Bellevue Hospital.
Q: What was discussed [*6]  at the meeting?
A: I asked if my faculty appointment could be reduced to 50 percent effort while I continued to apply for grants. I would still qualify for benefits and I would need NYU's REF at 70 percent rather than 35 percent. It was then that I was informed by Lucy Cribben that extramural funding for my salary had dropped to 5 percent.
Q: Were you aware that Dr. Young's grant would run out on August 31, 2010?
A: Yes. I also knew I was able to get funding. I would ask him to continue my salary support on the new grant if I was allowed to change my position to part-time.
Q: Did you find out why Dr. Rom removed your salary from his grant?
A: He heard that I wanted to take —
(Tse Tr. 399:25-400:16.)
8. The required extramural funding policy ("REF Policy") was set forth in the NYU Langone Medical Center Policy on Performance Expectations for Research Faculty. (Trial Ex. 10.)
9. The REF Policy applied "to all full-time faculty in the basic science departments, and to faculty in the clinical departments who are paid to do research." (Trial Ex. 10 at NYU003082.)
10. The REF Policy applied to both tenured and non-tenured faculty, though it was "primarily for tenured faculty." (Abramson Tr. 259:4-8.) [*7] 
11. For the 2008-2009 academic year, the REF was 50%. (Trial Ex. 9 at NYU003722.) In the 2009-2010 academic year, the REF was 55%. (Id.) In the 2010-2011, the REF was 60%. (Trial Ex. 10 at NYU003084; see also Trial Ex. 30 P 6.)
12. According to the REF Policy, for the 2010-2011 year "a research faculty member who is full-time in the basic science departments or a full-time researcher in a clinical department is expected to provide from extramural funding at least 60% of total compensation (or a higher percentage if pre-existing arrangements or promulgated departmental policies exist requiring a higher percentage)." (Trial Ex. 10 at NYU003084.)
13. According to Dr. Abramson, the percentages in the REF Policy were a "floor requirement but a chair may set it higher." (Abramson Tr. 259:4-23.)
14. According to the REF Policy, "[i]n order to assure that all research faculty understand the REF required of them, Chairs will send a letter of responsibilities to each faculty member annually informing each faculty member of his/her performance over the past academic year as well as expectations for the coming year, including required extramural funding." (Trial Ex. 10 at NYU003087; see also Trial [*8]  Ex. 9.)
15. A September 18, 2009 letter from Dr. Blaser to Dr. Tse stated:
In keeping with the Dean's directive, in his February 9, 2009, letter to faculty, I am writing to confirm our expectations of you for the 2008-2009 academic year as Associate Professor (Research). . . . The Dean's letter to the faculty dated March 18, 2008, described performance expectations adopted for research faculty. Each full-time faculty member in the clinical departments is expected to have achieved extramural funding support for at least 50% of the portion of his/her salary allocated to conduct research as of September 2008 and continuing thereafter in accordance with increasing percentages for subsequent years. In the case where the department's standards exceed the performance standards in the Dean's letter, the department standards will be preserved.
. . .
For the 2008-2009 academic year, you are expected to obtain from extramural funding at least 50% of the portion (100%) of your total annualized salary that is attributable to your research responsibilities. Based on the AEC criteria, your required extramural funding (REF) for the 2008-2009 academic year is $52,029. Your current support on extramural [*9]  funding is $104,058 which meets the AEC performance standards. We congratulate you for your achievement and greatly appreciate your many contributions to the Department and the School.
(Trial Ex. 8.)
16. Dr. Tse found out about the annual REF through that and other similar letters. (Tse Tr. 402:23-403:3.) The letters informed Dr. Tse about the REF for the previous year. (Id. 403:13-404:5 ("So, essentially you are informed after the fact whether you have met the school's REF and for that particular year. . . . The point is you are never informed before the school year started what is expected of you by the department chair.").)
17. Dr. Blaser believed that Dr. Tse was required to fund 100% of her salary through extramural support. (Blaser Tr. 37:9-14.)
18. Dr. Blaser testified that:
This letter of 2009 came as the policy was being developed. It was being developed over a series of years. And our position for you and for everyone in the department who was on the research track is that they had to achieve 100 percent of their salary just as you had in that year. And this "at least 50 percent" was probably an error because it was really 100 percent.
(Blaser Tr. 39:16-40:7.)
19. Dr. Blaser is [*10]  unaware of whether any corrective letter was sent to Dr. Tse to inform her that she was subject to a higher REF than the one listed in the REF Policy and September 2009 letter. (Blaser Tr. 40:4-7.)
20. NYU never informed Dr. Tse that she was subject to a different REF than the ones listed in the REF Policy or annual letters. (Tse Tr. 404:1-14 ("The point is you are never informed before the school year started what is expected of you by the department chair. That's information that you need from essentially the policies for research faculty. . . . Now, both Dr. Abramson and Dr. Blaser said that REF varies from one department to another but if you are not informed before the school year starts, you really do not have any idea what it was supposed to be.").)
21. Dr. Abramson testified that the REF Policy was intended to give department chairs discretion "because the non-tenured faculty are faculty at-will and the chair has to make a decision, depending on their ability to get extramural funding, or be collaborative scientists with other funded scientists, how much that person needs to bring in on their own with regard to the extramural funding requirement." (Abramson Tr. 259:23-260:4.) [*11] 
22. Dr. Abramson did not know about Dr. Blaser's policy specifically, but "he, like other chairs, expected non-tenured faculty members to cover 100 percent of their salary." (Abramson Tr. 320:13-15.)
23. Dr. Abramson testified:
Q: First of all, Dr. Blaser's expectations of 100 percent REF for research faculty in his department. And should Dr. Blaser have informed the research faculty members exactly that that's what was expected of them?
A: I don't know that he's under any school-wide obligation to have that specific discussion.
Q: How were those research faculty members expected to know what the department chair considers appropriate job performance?
. . .
A: If someone is bringing in research, and coming close to the 60 percent or more, it's one kind of discussion with a faculty member. If someone is not getting any grants, and only has 5 percent funding, it really puts a lot of stress on the department chairs to know what to do. And that's when these conversations often happen. But not abruptly. . . . So, you know, I think it's really when things get down to that kind of level that it becomes a crisis, both for the individual and the department, frankly.
(Abramson Tr. 331:9-332:9.)
24. NYU [*12]  created the REF system because "there was not extra money in the school in the department to subsidize people who were unable to get their own grants." (Abramson Tr. 306:6-8.)
25. According to Dr. Abramson, who helped to draft the REF policy:
It was not a period -- years ago there was a lot of money in the system and people could be supported for longer periods. In fact, the reason we even put in that 60 percent floor was that we were trying to stop a hemorrhaging, frankly, of scientists who -- researchers who were poorly funded. We had no benchmark, like many schools have around the country, to say you really have to try and do better. People were just collecting -- we had $20 million of salaries going to faculty with no grants so we put in place these parameters. We guided them in over about a four-year period and then we have standards at NYU that everyone understands is the 60 percent but it was in the context of we just can't continue to give dollars for research when there is no dollars coming in for research.
(Abramson Tr. 306:9-22.)
26. Dr. Blaser testified:
Q: Why can't the Department of Medicine pay salary of non-tenured faculty members who do not have grant funding?
A: Well, the [*13]  Department of Medicine could but -- . . . The Department of Medicine could do that but, in practice, there is just not enough money to do that and our primary obligation is for our tenured faculty members. And that is true at NYU and just about every university I am aware of.
(Blaser Tr. 62:13-63:4.)
27. The grant application process consists of the following steps:
You have a question. You start with an idea which is fundamentally a question. . . . And so then you frame — you frame a grant, which says what several things I would have to test and do in order to answer that question. So you set a hypothesis. . . . Then you write a 25 or now a 12-page document that takes you several months. It is a very arduous process. And you write a grant, you involve other people with expertise that add value to your grant, and then you submit it. And you write your approach, how you are going to do it, what tests you are going to do, how you are going to analyze it, what are the statistics, and you submit it. The process is arduous.
(Abramson Tr. 322:5-19.)
28. A grant application "takes a lot of robust data." (Abramson Tr. 322:25-323:2.)
29. Both Dr. Blaser and Dr. Abramson were aware that Dr. Tse would [*14]  need preliminary data to develop grant applications to obtain additional extramural funding and meet her REF. (Blaser Tr. 16:9-15; Abramson Tr. 323:5-8.)
30. Preliminary data could be obtained from new experiments, previously conducted research, from colleagues, or through collaborations. (Blaser Tr. 27:5-12; Abramson Tr. 322:25-323:8.)
31. Dr. Tse was prohibited from soliciting collaborations with or using data obtained by researchers using the Core facility while she was the Core Director. (Tse Tr. 397:20-398:6, 398:16-399:5, 453:13-25.)
32. It would take "at least a year to put a new research proposal together and six months for it to be reviewed and approved for funding." (Tse Tr. 383:16-21; see also Def.'s Proposed Findings of Fact P 82.) If approved, it would take "another three months, minimally, to start funding." (Id. 514:6-13.)
33. Dr. Abramson's most recent grant application "took six months to write." (Abramson Tr. 322:19-24, 332:10-12.)
34. It would take several months before a grant application that was not funded could be resubmitted, and certain types of applications could not be resubmitted. (Abramson Tr. 334:2-14, 335:3-12, 335:21-336:5.)
35. It is possible that it would [*15]  have taken Dr. Tse a year or more to make up the 65% of her salary support she lost when she was removed from the Core Director position. (Abramson Tr. 332:10-16.)
36. Approximately 10% of National Institute of Health grant applications are funded, and there is no guarantee that any such grant will be funded. (Abramson Tr. 305:14-24, 322:22-24.)
37. Between April 2010 and July 19, 2010, Dr. Tse worked on a grant proposal with Dr. Joan Reibman, with whom she had worked prior to her removal from the Core. (Tse Tr. 443:21-444:16, 475:11-17; see Trial Ex. 11.) The application was submitted on July 19, 2010. (Tse Tr. 399:2-3.)
38. While collaborating with Dr. Reibman, Dr. Tse did not have to do any lab work. (Tse Tr. 467:8-18 ("I did not have to [do lab work] and that wasn't my role on their projects. . . . I supervised lab work, but I never had to do any lab work with my own hands.").)
39. The preliminary data included in the grant application was obtained from previous work by post-doctoral fellow Dr. Bertram Bleck, which was funded by Dr. Reibman and a pilot grant. (Tse Tr. 398:16-20, 442:21-443:3, 446:17-24, 447:22-449:7.)
40. Dr. Tse did not conduct the manual lab experiments, but supervised [*16]  Dr. Bleck's experiments. (Id.)
41. In an August 25, 2010 email, Dr. Reibman wrote to Dr. Blaser:
As you well know, I as well as many others have worked with Dr. Tse for many years. She has and continues to serve as an invaluable collaborator. As the Core Director of the CFAR Flow Cytometry Core, she provided guidance and helped with study design and implementation for immunology studies. . . . She has provided guidance that only an experienced scientist can provide. . . . Although my research scientists went to her lab to work with her and manually perform the studies, they did them under her guidance and with her staining strategies. In addition, they used her laboratory equipment for these studies before her lab was dismantled. In my experience, Dr. Tse ran one of the few true research cores at NYU. By that I mean she provided intellectual and scientific guidance for experimental design, implementation and data processing and analysis. She did not just turn on a piece of equipment and hope you could figure it out. She trained my research scientists. She is not a technician, but a trained and experienced researcher. As you well know, there is a big difference.
(Trial Ex. 55.)
42. Dr. [*17]  Reibman was "planning for a competitive renewal with Doris [Tse] as a co-investigator and [they] also submitted a recent grant together." (Trial Ex. 55.)
43. The "competitive renewal" was the renewal of a funded project on asthma that Dr. Tse had previously worked on with Dr. Reibman and Dr. Bleck. (Tse Tr. 445:21-25, 469:8-10.) That granted ended in April 2011 and would have been up for renewal in late 2010. (Tse Tr. 469:11-13, 510:20-511:3.)
44. Between July 19, 2010 and August 31, 2010, Dr. Tse did not work on another grant proposal because she believed that her faculty appointment expired on August 31, 2010. (Tse Tr. 475:11-17.)
45. Dr. Tse did not have enough time to submit another grant proposal before August 31, 2010, because it was her understanding that she was prohibited from applying through NYU after her faculty appointment expired. (Tse Tr. 399:9-12, 456:10-20, 475:7-17 ("I was not relieved of my duties as the core director until April 1st. Between April 1st and July 19, when the RFA was submitted, we were awfully tied up putting that grant together, or that grant proposal together. So, and after July 19, you can't put a grant proposal together in six weeks. My faculty appointment, [*18]  which provides me with the privilege of applying for grants, ended August 31.").)
46. Dr. Tse believed that "it would take a year to put a grant proposal together," so that "it would be an exercise in futility would be an appropriate way of putting it to try and put something together in six weeks which would be thrown back at me with the comment commonly used by NIH reviews, 'hastily assembled.'" (Tse Tr. 476:18-25.)
47. After submitting the grant application on July 19, 2010, in order to obtain other extramural funding, Dr. Tse "sounded out all possible sources, people that [she] ha[d] worked with previously, whether they could use somebody with [her] expertise. And no, [she] could not find anybody who had money to pay for [her] salary or they had no use for [her] expertise." (Tse Tr. 478:6-14.)
48. Dr. Tse learned that the grant application was not funded in late November 2010. (Trial Tr. 333:20-25.)
49. Because Dr. Tse had "devoted [her] attention to the core, [she] did not see to it that [she] would have built up an independent research program." (Tse Tr. 480:16-23.)
50. Dr. Tse could not increase her funding from existing grants because grants are awarded for specific proposals and [*19]  cannot be increased beyond a certain amount without NIH approval. (Cribben Tr. 209:2-13 (Q: Then are you aware that the faculty who have research awards, namely in my case, or in Dr. Tse's case, the collaborators Dr. Rom, Dr. Reibman, and Dr. Young, 35 percent of Dr. Tse's salary was supported by them? A: Hmm-hmm. Q: Are you aware that those grants were awarded to them for a specific proposal, which they could not change just because Dr. Tse needed additional salary? A: Well, I'm not talking about those specific grants. I'm talking about applying for new grants with them.); Id. 214:15-24 (Q: Are you aware then that once a grant is awarded, that there is a certain goal that the principal investigators to whom the grants were awarded had to meet? A: Yes. Q: Furthermore, are you aware that any change in personnel in particular from an NIH grant has to be resubmitted to the NIH if it differs by more than 25 percent? A: I don't know where this is going, but yes, I do know all that.).)
51. Dr. Tse had successfully had obtained grant funding for the Core from 2000-2010, and was an investigator alone or in collaboration with other researchers on at least six other grants (Trial Ex. 55; Trial [*20]  Ex. 47; Trial Ex. 39.)
52. Since her termination from NYU in 2011, Dr. Tse has continued to work with some of her NYU collaborators, and started a new collaboration with a professor at Columbia University. (Tse Tr. 410:10-13.) Dr. Tse has co-authored nine scholarly publications. (Trial Ex. 59.) Dr. Tse was involved with "reviewing the data, compiling the data, analyzing the data, . . . and then drawing conclusions from it." (Tse Tr. 522:18-523:25.) She was not funded for this work, but did it "as a matter of professional obligation." (Id.)
B. NYU's Knowledge of Dr. Tse's Disability and Need for Accommodations as of June 1, 2010
53. NYU was aware of Plaintiff's disability dating back to at least 2005. (Trial Ex. 3.)
54. During her time as Core Director, Plaintiff had a laboratory assistant as an accommodation, which was funded by her NIH grant.5 (Trial Tr. 211:14-15.)
55. In a December 2009 email from Mr. Odom to Dr. Tse, Mr. Odom confirmed that he had "been informed that [she] would like to request an accommodation in order to continue to perform the essential functions of [her] position" and instructed Dr. Tse to "contact [his] office at the number below so that [they] can set up a meeting [*21]  to discuss the details of [her] accommodation request." (Trial Ex. 22.)
56. By letter dated March 3, 2010, Dr. Tse's rheumatologist, Dr. Bruce Solitar, advised Mr. Odom about Dr. Tse's lupus and severe osteoarthritis, and noted that "[w]hile Dr. Tse remains able to work full-time as a scientist, she has great difficulty performing experiments on a day-to-day basis. She requires an individual with proper scientific training to perform the bench [work] she is unable to do. I recommend and fully support her request to reinstate a post doc position as an ADA accommodation." (Trial Ex. 24.)
57. Dr. Solitar's letter confirmed to Mr. Odom that Dr. Tse was disabled under the ADA, and that she expressed that "she could provide the intellectual piece that's needed to do her job, but what she needed was somebody to help her with the manual issues that she needed to deal with in terms of the experiments." (Odom Tr. 115:14-20.)
58. While still in the Core position, Dr. Tse had requested a post-doctoral fellow, rather than a lab assistant, as an accommodation to help with lab work. (Odom Tr. 129:21-25.)
59. Mr. Odom believed that Dr. Solitar's March 3, 2010 letter was an effort to support Dr. Tse's [*22]  request for a post-doctoral fellow as her accommodation, rather than as a request for a new accommodation. (Id. 115:21-116:6.)
60. Plaintiff did not make an additional request for an accommodation after she was removed from the Core Director position. (See Blaser Tr. 60:12-15 (Q: Between June 1st, 2010 and April 4th of 2011, did Dr. Tse ever ask you for any specific accommodation for her medical condition? A: I don't believe so.); Odom Tr. 117:2-17 ("I don't recall a request for any kind of accommodation after our initial discussion [while Dr. Tse was Core Director]. . . . And at no point in time do I recall any additional requests for accommodation in the different role that she was in.").)
61. Nevertheless, Mr. Odom was aware that Dr. Tse needed an accommodation after she was removed from the Core position. (Odom Tr. 130:1-6.)
62. After her removal from the Core position, Dr. Tse informed NYU on multiple occasions that she would be unable to do the laboratory work required to gather preliminary data for future grant applications without an accommodation. On May 13, 2010, Dr. Tse wrote to Dr. Blaser:
I am hereby requesting Long Term Disability leave pertaining to 65% of my time and effort [*23]  at NYUSM starting 6/01/10. Performing laboratory experiments on biohazardous specimens (human fluids and tissue isolates) requires a level of manual dexterity and fine control I no longer have, which precludes increasing my time and effort on collaborative projects with Drs. W. Rom, J. Reibman, and B. Young or generating preliminary data that is needed to apply for independent funding from extramural sources.
(Trial Ex. 6.)
63. In a follow-up email to Mr. Odom the next day, Dr. Tse wrote:
My current role as co-investigator involves proposing research projects, writing grants, designing and supervising laboratory experiments, and interpreting and publishing data, which does not require manual dexterity beyon[d] the ability to type and operate a mouse. I cannot, and do not, want to request 100% leave. . . . The 65% leave or loss of income may decrease or increase as positions with ADA accommodations at [NYU School of Medicine] is opened or closed, and will require adjustment over time.
(Trial Ex. 25.)
64. Dr. Tse hoped to obtain Long Term Disability benefits to cover her 65% salary loss, but she still expected to continue working at NYU with lab assistance. (Tse Tr. 384:2-9 (Q: Did you ask [*24]  Mr. Odom to help you with long-term disability benefits? A: Yes. From my conversations with Reggie, there was no viable option available from NYU to prevent a 65 percent loss in my salary in two months. Q: Did you specify to Mr. Odom that you could continue with the other 35 percent because there were lab workers on those projects? A: Yes.).)
65. Mr. Odom did not interpret these communications as requests for accommodation but rather, requests to be put on long-term disability leave. (Odom Tr. 142:2-4.)
66. Dr. Blaser also did not interpret Dr. Tse's letter as a request for accommodation. (Blaser Tr. 27:13-28:8 (Q: But on May 13, 2010, when I sent you [Exhibit 6], did you then realize that I needed laboratory assistants? A: Your letter stated that you're requesting long-term disability because it requires a level of manual dexterity and fine control I no longer have. And I accept that at face value. . . . Q: And Mr. Odom did not convey to you that I was applying for long-term disability because I no longer have the laboratory assistants I need to do my job? A: I don't remember what he said to me or not. But I don't remember that you ever came to me and said 'I need laboratory assistants [*25]  to do my job.' It's possible you did, I have no memory of that.).)
67. Mr. Odom testified that he was unaware of whether Dr. Tse's need for accommodations would continue after her removal from the Core Director position, but that he understood she needed accommodations to perform lab work. (Odom Tr. 120:4-16, 132:1-24, 145:8-11, 176:8-12.)
68. At a meeting on August 25, 2010, with Dr. Blaser, Mr. Odom, and Ms. Cribben, Plaintiff again explained that she would be unable to generate preliminary data needed for grant applications without lab assistance. (Cribben Tr. 200:6-18, 220:6-10, 230:13-15; Tse Tr. 404:15-18, 408:1-2; Trial Ex. 55.)
C. Proposed Accommodations
69. Ms. Sanchez, Senior Vice President and Vice Dean of Human Resources and Organizational Development and Learning for the NYU Medical Center, testified:
THE COURT: Ms. Sanchez, in your capacity at NYU, do you specifically deal with employees with disabilities?
A: I have staff that deal directly with the employees who have disabilities.
THE COURT: All right. Do they report directly back to you?
A: Sometimes, sometimes not.
THE COURT: Did you have any knowledge or involvement with Dr. Tse's claim?
A: I was just aware of the fact that [*26]  there was a situation with Dr. Tse and insufficient funding to source her salary. But it was Reg Odom who handled the case itself in terms of representing HR.
(Sanchez Tr. 96:6-18.)
70. Mr. Odom, the NYU human resources officer in charge of facilitating provision of reasonable accommodations confirmed that NYU did not inquire about or offer Dr. Tse any accommodation after her removal from the Core. (Odom Tr. 133:2-12; 153:1-14.)
71. Mr. Odom testified:
THE COURT: [W]hat did you understand NYU's responsibilities to be toward an individual who qualifies for ADA accommodations?
A: NYU would be obligated to engage in an interactive process to talk to the individual, and that was part of our role, and the role I played in this situation was to find out what accommodation as needed to support that individual performing the essential functions of the job. If we can provide the accommodation, if it was reasonable to provide that.
In the situation where we initially talked, what we talked about was providing accommodation when she was director of the lab, and that was the accommodation of providing a technician to provide the manual manipulations that were needed in the role. Once she was removed [*27]  from the lab, there weren't additional discussions about specific positions or needs for accommodation.
(Odom Tr. 129:11-130:6.)
72. Similarly, Ms. Cribben, the administrator for the Department of Medicine, recalls discussing only potential collaborations that Dr. Tse could foster with other researchers to obtain extramural funding, but does not recall discussing any accommodations at the August 2010 meeting. (Cribben Tr. 206:8-15, 208:20-209:1, 209:21-25, 219:14-22, 220:24-221:3.)
73. Neither Dr. Blaser nor Mr. Odom discussed accommodations with Dr. Tse after she was removed from the Core position. (Tse Tr. 474:9-21, 474:22-475:6 (Q: Isn't it true that Reggie Odom never told you between June of 2010 and April of 2011 that NYU would not accommodate your disability? A: He never discussed that with me either. He never asked me exactly what I needed, whether I would consider alternatives to lab help. As I indicated in my testimony, after we got together in early April, we, between the two of us, we couldn't come up with any other option that NYU has to offer except to apply for long-term disability in order to make sure that I would have an income.).)
a. Lab Assistance
74. The main accommodation [*28]  sought by Dr. Tse was the provision of lab assistance to help her conduct laboratory experiments. Dr. Tse believed that "[t]he only accommodation that would allow [her] to work as a member of the research faculty were laboratory assistants, or a position that did not require lab work." (Tse Tr. 409:19-21.)
75. NYU permitted Dr. Tse to have continued access to laboratory space and lab technicians already working in the lab. (Odom Tr. 158:15-159:17.)
76. Researchers have to pay for use of the laboratory. (Tse Tr. 470:1-3; Abramson Tr. 287:6-9 (THE COURT: So if you are not on a grant, and you want to use machines that came with a grant, you could be asked to pay for it. A: That's correct.)
77. Lab technicians usually work for particular researchers or on particular projects. (Abramson Tr. 287:6-19 (THE COURT: If you ask to use, for instance, lab assistants who came with someone else's grant, would that also require you to pay for their time or would they just be thrown in with the lab? A: Usually, lab assistants work specifically on projects for which they were funded by their principal investigator. Sometimes two investigators will share an assistant. But usually it's -- they're not to [*29]  be utilized by people who come in, unlike the instrument, by people who come in to get their services.).)
78. Dr. Tse could not reserve time in the lab without a discretionary account, which are opened at the discretion of the Department of Medicine. The Department of Medicine did not open an account for Dr. Tse, and she could not apply to receive pro bono lab services. (Tse Tr. 470:12-471:11 (Q: Between June 1st, 2010, and April 4, 2011, did you yourself ever ask for what you call pro bono laboratory services? A: No. Because you can't even reserve time unless you can provide them with an account number. Q. When you lost your funding after your removal as the core director in April of 2010, you did not have any discretionary funding account, correct? A. None was opened for me. . . . Q: Do you know if that's because there was no extramural funding to put in that discretionary account? A: From what I know, discretionary accounts are what they say they are. It is opened at the discretion of the department, and they would involve intramural funding. When you get extramural funding, they are essentially bound by the mandates of the award to set up an account for the awardee. Q: Isn't it [*30]  true that between June 1st, 2010, and April 4, 2011, you never asked Dr. Blaser or anyone in the department of medicine to set up a discretionary intramural account for you? A: Like I said, those accounts are set up at the discretion of the department. It is not up to the faculty member to demand them.).)
79. The Department of Medicine did not provide Dr. Tse with any funding to hire a lab technician or to pay for use of the lab equipment. (Cribben Tr. 193:24-194:18, 226:2-5.)
80. Dr. Tse did not ask for money or funds to pay for laboratory services because she believed she had made it clear to Mr. Odom previously that she could not do lab work without assistance. (Tse Tr. 471:12-472:5 (Q: Isn't it true that between June 1st, 2010, and April 4 of 2011, that you never asked the department of medicine for money or funds for you to use laboratory services? A: No, I did not. But I made it plainly clear to both Odom and Dr. Blaser what the limitations are stemming from my disability. Q: Between June 1st of 2010 and April 4 of 2011, you never asked the department of medicine to direct any technician or other employee in the laboratory to perform an experiment for you, right? A: No, I did not [*31]  ask, because once again, I do not feel that I was in the position to make those demands. I have, once again, explicitly informed Mr. Odom and Dr. Blaser on more than one occasion why I cannot perform my job without help.).)
81. The cost of hiring a post-doctoral fellow as a lab assistant would have been approximately $39,000 per year. (Trial Ex. 7.)
82. The NYU Langone Medical Center employs 27,000 employees, approximately 2,400 of which are adjunct faculty members who do not receive salaries from NYU. (Sanchez Tr. 80:16-20, 81:2-4.)
83. The Department of Medicine has approximately 1,000 faculty members. (Blaser Tr. 5:10-12.)
84. Dr. Abramson testified:
Q: [B]etween April 2010 to April 2011, is it your position that for lack of money NYU would not be obligated to provide reasonable accommodations to Dr. Tse's impairment?
A: That's correct. That's correct. That — that the organization has to be self-sustaining and it is unfortunate that decisions have to be made that sometimes employment can no longer continue if a person is failing — failing to meet the expectations of getting extramural funding. If a person is hired as a scientist and a scientist is not getting extramural funding, then [*32]  that's a failing scientist, period. And you can't maintain people who are not getting grants.
(Abramson Tr. 307:5-17.)
85. Dr. Abramson further testified:
Q: [I]n what manner did NYU accommodate Dr. Tse's disability so she could meet her job expectations, the 60 percent REF --. . . .
A: [S]omeone who is removed as a core director for whatever justification now is not being funded because a big part of their salary is not funded, the department chair and the investigator can work together to try and find alternatives. With a non-tenured faculty member there is, in my view, no obligation to do so. . . . On the other hand, if there was no money -- and this is, by the way, a time when the NYU School of Medicine was losing over a hundred million dollars a year and a lot of it from research -- and so there was not a lot of extra money in the system. And so, one can't simply say an investigator has lost their grants, I have a pile of money over here and I am going to give it to them. . . . The obligation is to run an efficient lab and to get people funded and to be as helpful as they can. I understand they did -- a year went by and then you were in the laboratory and tried to do some work. Beyond [*33]  that, as a non-tenured faculty who serves at-will, the department had no further obligation, from what I know about the situation, to provide assistance, help, technicians, or more money after it became clear that you were not able to gain funding. Then it becomes the discretion of the chair who is trying to manage a budget under very strict circumstances.
(Id. 303:23-305:13)(emphasis added.)
86. Dr. Abramson did not believe that NYU was required to provide a lab assistant to accommodate Dr. Tse's disability, but that identifying collaborations was sufficient:
THE COURT: In your opinion, based on this diagnosis by Dr. Solitar, would Dr. Tse qualify for an accommodation?
A: I don't know that it frankly means that additional help must be provided by the person who you are working with but it certainly would involve a discussion. I would sit down with Dr. Tse and say, okay, what can you do, what can't you do. Let's see if we can map out some experimentations or collaborations to allow you to continue to work. But I don't think it would trigger, well, I must hire somebody else to assist Dr. Tse which is a different discussion.
THE COURT: Well, let's continue on that. What would — why would [*34]  you say that's a different discussion?
A: Well, I would look to see how Dr. Tse could do work in the laboratory but I wouldn't feel that it would be then my obligation to say that piece that you don't, you are not able to do, I must hire a third person or a second person to assist you. My advice might be let's find some other scientist to work with you, let's do collaborations, especially if a person doesn't have their own grants. What we really try and do is find discussions with other doctors, other scientist who could allow that other person to work as part of a team, collaborative team. So, I would try and find a solution but I wouldn't say that I had an obligation to hire another person to assist at the bench.
THE COURT: Would you consider hiring another person to assist in the lab?
A: Only if I, as the leader of the lab, felt there was a collaborative project that either I was interested in proceeding with or with someone else in the laboratory was. So, what happens if someone has no funding, the chair really is in a position to decide is the value of what they're doing worth an additional investment for the project that you can do together, either for me if I am your direct supervisor [*35]  -- the person's direct supervisor -- or in the department if there are other people. But, at the end of the day, it has to be in the setting of how valuable I view that work is to invest more dollars into it to see the science go forward.
(Abramson Tr. 254:8-255:21.)
87. Ms. Cribben testified:
You know, people think medical schools are very rich. Medical schools operate right on the edge. Right on the edge. You know. They are dependent on all sorts of variable funding that changes every day. Reimbursement for health care changes, grants are constantly changing, and philanthropy. Those are the main sources of their revenue. And it is like a juggling act. There are no hard dollars there. So that's why we have to be very firm about [the REF].
(Cribben Tr. 207:23-208:5.)
88. NYU required that Dr. Tse come up with a research project before it would provide her with funding for lab assistance. (Odom Tr. 168:4-10 ("If there was a request she needed we wanted to understand what she was doing. If she had projects that she needed support on, we wanted to hear from her, what support do you need. And at the time, I don't recall her raising any particular projects that she was working on or ideas for [*36]  research that she was working on that she needed support."); id. 177:18-23 ("So what we felt that you could do was you had the brain power -- and still do, you're a very sharp person -- to come up with research ideas, and then the execution of those ideas and the lab work that would be necessary was where we would have come in to help support you. But what we needed first was ideas for you to pursue.").)
89. Dr. Tse did not raise specific research projects or proposals with Dr. Blaser, Mr. Odom or Ms. Cribben. (Blaser Tr. 59:13-60:11 (Q: Between June 1st of 2010 and April 4 of 2011, did Dr. Tse ever specifically come to you and ask you to identify any principal investigators or tenured faculty members that she could collaborate with to get funding? A: I don't believe so. . . . Q: At any point after Dr. Tse was removed as the director of the core, did she ever come to you with any specific research project that she wanted to pursue to get grant money? A: I don't believe so. . . . Q: Did Dr. Tse ever come and brainstorm, so to speak, with you about research proposals or funding that she wanted to pursue? A: No.); see also Cribben Tr. 202:9-15 ("[NYU] did support you for over a year, and [*37]  you only submitted one grant is my understanding, with Dr. Reibman. If, you know, three months later you said, look, I have this grant that I have done with Dr. So-and-so and I am submitting it, but you didn't do that. You didn't come to us and say, oh, I have another grant. This one wasn't funded, I have another grant now that I am putting in. You didn't do that.").)
90. Dr. Tse did not tell Dr. Blaser about specific experiments she wished to perform because:
[h]e has applied for many, many grants and he's a very well-funded researcher. So I did not think I would need to spell out to him exactly the nature of the experiments which I could have done. If he had responded to my letter and say, hey, Doris, exactly what kind of experiments do you need to do? I would be happy to provide him with a long list.
(Tse Tr. 473:12-18.)
b. Salary Continuation
91. NYU continued to pay Dr. Tse's salary between June 1, 2010 and April 4, 2011. (Tse Tr. 413:1-10, 422:23-25, 427:23-428:1.)
92. The level and length of salary continuation provided to Dr. Tse was unusual as compared to that provided to other non-tenure track professors at NYU. (Odom Tr. 163:9-16.)
93. Mr. Odom told Dr. Valentine, Dr. Blaser, Ms. [*38]  Cribben, and an NYU attorney that "[t]o the extent that we have flexibility we should give her as much time as possible to obtain extramural funding and other internal sources of funding." (Trial Ex. 26; Odom Tr. 151:5-12.)
94. Dr. Blaser testified:
Q: After Dr. Tse was removed as the director of the core in April 2010, did you want her to [succeed] in obtaining funding to continue her employment at NYU?
A: Yes.
Q: Did you have any hostility or animosity towards her because of her medical condition?
A: I did not.
(Blaser Tr. 66:2-66:8.)
95. Mr. Odom's "understanding is [] that [lab assistance] was an accommodation that was available while [Dr. Tse was] the director of the lab. Beyond that point, there was no additional request for accommodation, other than the fact that [her] salary was continued." (Odom Tr. 124:14-21.)
96. Mr. Odom believed that "the technician was the accommodation associated with [her] being the lab director, and an additional significant accommodation was [her] salary was never discontinued. Despite the fact that [she was] only down to . . . 35 percent funding or something to that effect." (Id. 125:7-12; see also id. 177:3-4 ("[Y]es, I did perceive it as an accommodation [*39]  to continue at full salary.").)
97. NYU did not guarantee Dr. Tse's salary continuation for any particular period of time, and it was subject to change at the discretion of the Department of Medicine Chairperson. Mr. Odom "did not say to Dr. Tse that her salary would be continued for a certain period of time because [he] wasn't clear how long the department could support it." (Odom Tr. 162:5-8, 162:25-163:1.)
98. NYU did not communicate to Dr. Tse its decision to continue her salary after May 31, 2010. (Tse Tr. 383:2 (Q: Did Mr. Odom tell you that you would be allowed extra time to get funding? A: No.).)
99. Mr. Odom did not tell or send a letter to Dr. Tse informing her that her salary would be continued beyond May 31, 2010 and was not aware of whether anyone ever did. (Odom Tr. 124:20-25, 125:20-25, 161:1-8, 165:2-16; Tse Tr. 383:8-9.)
100. Dr. Tse did not know that NYU had decided to continue her salary past May 31, 2010. (Id. 524:19-21 (Q: [A]s it turned out you already acknowledge you did not receive any pay cut? A: Yes, but I wasn't told that that was going to happen.).)
101. Although Dr. Tse continued to receive her paycheck after May 31, 2010, she believed her faculty appointment [*40]  and her salary would end on August 31, 2010. (Tse Tr. 382:12-15 ("My faculty appointment would end with the academic year on August 31, but there was no salary guarantee."); id. 405:15-17, 420:25-421:6.)
102. After August 31, 2010, Dr. Tse "went to work every day, not knowing if that would be [her] last day." (Tse Tr. 409:5-9.)
103. Ten months of salary continuation would not have been enough time for Dr. Tse to obtain extramural funding. (See supra ¶ 32.)
104. According to Dr. Blaser, ten months of salary continuation would not have been enough time for most faculty, including tenure-track faculty, to obtain funding:
THE COURT: Now, you have described the individual on tenure track as particularly promising which would mean they are somewhat above the cut, if you will?
A: Yes.
THE COURT: All right.
A: That they are capable of achieving national recognition for a body of scholarly work.
THE COURT: All right. And I guess my question is for the gifted tenure-track people, even they might not be able to build up their [required extramural funding] within the first year or two to expectations, correct?
A: Yes.
THE COURT: And so, this five-year period is some sort of guideline by which you would [*41]  expect your particularly gifted people to have made up their full REF?
A: Yes.
(Blaser Tr. 72:9-16.)
105. Mr. Odom was aware that Dr. Tse's conditions were chronic and were "going to get worse." (Odom Tr. 177:5-8.)
106. Salary continuation would not have enabled Dr. Tse to perform lab work without assistance. (Tse Tr. 383:15-21 ("[N]o amount of time would work if I did not have lab assistants to generate the preliminary data that was needed. The osteoarthritis would not get better, it would only get worse with time."); Odom Tr. 177:9-17 (Q: So, providing her with an extension in salary payment would not have enabled her to regain the ability to do lab work. . . . A: I disagree a little bit there because what providing you with the extension in salary did is gave you more time without a hardship to you personally to come up with ideas for additional research.).)
D. Assistance with LTD Benefits Application
107. NYU assisted Dr. Tse in applying for LTD benefits through its long-term disability insurance provider, Unum. (Tse Tr. 384:2-24.)
108. In an email to Unum, NYU's LTD disability insurance provider, Margaret Meagher, the NYU Human Resources Department Director of Benefits, answered Unum's [*42]  question about Dr. Tse as follows: "Could she continue with her professor duties without lab work? Yes." (Trial Ex. 19.)
109. As of May 2010, Dr. Tse believed that "from [her] conversations with Reggie [Odom], there was no viable option available from NYU to prevent a 65 percent loss in my salary in two months." (Tse Tr. 384:206.)
110. According to Dr. Tse, during her conversation with Mr. Odom:
We basically explored options and there were none. I told him there is no way that I can put together a grant application, first because I cannot do the lab work myself to produce the preliminary data that I would need. And also because I would have to do it in three months. It's just impossible. And he had no suggestions as to how I can prevent that 65 percent salary loss.
. . .
He did not tell me that I would be given extra time. And he did not tell me that I would be provided laboratory assistants, and he did not tell me that the school would find the different position for me that would not require lab work. All right. So, he did not explore those possibilities with me. And the only thing we can come up with is, yes, I would be covered by long-term disability benefits and I definitely qualified [*43]  to claim for those benefits.
(Tse Tr. 386:4-23.)
111. Dr. Tse characterized her conversation with Mr. Odom as follows:
Q: Isn't it true that Reggie Odom did not demand that you in fact submit [the LTD application] to Unum?
A: He did not demand. But he could not come up with alternative options for me not to lose 65 percent of my salary.
(Tse Tr. 425:10-16.)
112. Rather than discussing accommodations, Mr. Odom "prod[ded] the process for [Dr. Tse] to pursue long-term disability." (Odom Tr. 117:2-17 ("After she was removed [from the Core], the discussions I recall were about me trying to help prod the process for her to pursue long-term disability, and then subsequently there was a later conversation with myself and a couple of others where we were checking in on how she was doing in her need to get additional support for her funding her job. And at no point in time do I recall any additional requests for accommodation in the different role that she was in.").)
113. Accordingly, Dr. Tse wrote the May 13, 2010 letter requesting to go on Long Term Disability leave, and worked with Margaret Meagher to complete the Unum LTD application. (See supra ¶¶ 62 and 107.)
114. Dr. Tse believed that she would [*44]  be continuing to work on projects representing 35% of her salary while receiving 65% of her salary in LTD benefits. (Tse Tr. 386:24-387:6 ("I can tell you that my understanding was that I do not need to be losing my entire income. I can definitely apply for disability benefits pertaining only to the 65 percent income that I would be losing come June 1st.").)
115. Dr. Tse told Mr. Odom that she could continue to work while receiving LTD benefits if accommodations were provided. (Trial Ex. 25 ("The 65% leave or loss of income may decrease or as positions with ADA accommodations at NYUSM is opened or closed, and will require adjustment over time."); 392:19-393:6 (Q: Did anyone at NYU discuss a return-to-work plan with you in the event you could return after you started to receiving (sic) long-term disability benefits? . . . A: No. . . . But I indicated to Reggie that I would be willing to return to work if positions with accommodations appeared.).)
116. Mr. Odom "was a little confused about [Dr. Tse's] request specifically for 65 percent of [her] effort. It confused [him] a little bit, which is what prompted [him] to ask if that was what [Dr. Tse was] intending to do. And [she] clarified, [*45]  articulating that [she was] trying to capture the piece of [her] salary that wasn't being supported by additional grant funding." (Odom Tr. 127:15-20.)
117. Mr. Odom did not respond to Dr. Tse's May 13, 2010 letter or May 14, 2010 email, nor discuss them with Dr. Blaser or Ms. Cribben. (Odom Tr. 140:14-141:7; Tse Tr. 393:9-12, 394:16-19, 427:13-19.)
118. Dr. Tse submitted her application for LTD benefits in May 2010. (Trial Exs. 16, 17.)
119. Dr. Tse followed up with Mr. Odom on June 3, 2010 but did not receive any response from Mr. Odom or Dr. Blaser. (Tse Tr. 393:9-12, 394:16-19; Trial Ex. 52.)
120. At the August 2010 meeting, NYU did not offer any accommodation to Dr. Tse, but presented the option of applying for LTD benefits. (Tse Tr. 402:17-19; see also Odom Tr. 153:1-11 ("No, specifically, we did not offer you any accommodation specifically, nor do I recall you asking for any specific accommodation during that meeting. In fact, I believe I recall in that meeting that you articulated that you didn't think you were going to be successful in finding additional funding support and I think that's how the conversation turned to long-term disability being a viable option."); id. 152:18-25 [*46]  ("I do recall we discussed that if you weren't able to get additional funding then long-term disability would be an option, because what Dr. Blaser also articulated was that the department couldn't continue, ad infinitum, to support your salary a hundred percent.").)
121. At the August 2010 meeting, Mr. Odom told Dr. Tse that she could only apply for 100%, not 65%, in LTD benefits. (Blaser Tr. 65:2-8 (Q: [W]hat was the discussion that you had about long-term disability? . . . A: I think that Dr. Tse wanted to apply for long-term disability for 65 percent of her effort but Mr. Odom said it was all or none, you have to apply for a hundred percent.).) According to Dr. Blaser, "the department and the school favored that option." (Id.) 122. Dr. Tse testified:
Q: Isn't it true that when you met with [Dr. Blaser] in August of 2010, you never at that point told him of any specific lab work that you needed done on any of your experiments? A: No, I did not, because upon telling him of my disability, and inability to do lab work, his suggestion was in that case you should consider long-term disability as an income source.
(Tse Tr. 473:19-25.)
123. Dr. Tse did not seek to withdraw her LTD application [*47]  when she became aware that she was continuing to receive her salary from NYU after May 31, 2010. (Tse Tr. 426:5-427:4.)
124. Dr. Tse did not withdraw her LTD application because "there was no guarantee nor assurance [she] would get a check" the following month. (Id.) Additionally, she believed that "not knowing what would happen, not knowing how long [she] would continue to be paid, the best safeguard that [she] could come up with was the disability insurance claim." (Id. 427:19-22.)
125. Beginning on April 5, 2011, Dr. Tse began receiving LTD benefits from Unum. (Trial Ex. 62a.)
126. Beginning in October 2011, Dr. Tse also began receiving SSDI benefits, which later transitioned to Social Security Retirement benefits when Dr. Tse turned 65 years old. (Tse Tr. 531:8-16; Trial Ex. 62c.)
127. Under the Unum policy, Dr. Tse was entitled to recover 60% of her former salary, up to $8,000.00 per month, in LTD benefits. (Trial Ex. 17; Tse Tr. 530:22-25.)
128. Per Unum's policy, Dr. Tse's LTD benefits was offset when she began to receive SSDI and later Social Security Retirement benefits, so that the total amount she received from both Unum and SSA remained at 60% of her previous salary. (Trial [*48]  Ex. 52; Trial Ex. 62c.)
E. Impact on Dr. Tse
129. After learning about her removal from the Core, Dr. Tse was "overwrought with anxiety over [her] looming pay cut and discharge from NYU." (Tse Tr. 518:17-19.) She was "miserable." (Id.)
130. Dr. Tse sought out medical attention and was "treated for stress in addition to the usual orthopedic issues by [her] usual acupuncturist" and took prescription medication for insomnia and migraine headaches. (Tse Tr. 518:20-519:2; see also Trial Ex. 60.)
131. Dr. Tse did not see a psychologist or psychiatrist for treatment. (Tse Tr. 524:22-24.)
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Plaintiff Dr. Tse argues that NYU denied her reasonable accommodation by failing to provide her with a qualified lab assistant, part time work, or reassignment to another position not requiring lab work. Defendant NYU argues that Plaintiff has failed to make out her reasonable accommodation claim. First, NYU argues that Dr. Tse withdrew from the "interactive process" and thus cannot now make a reasonable accommodation claim. Next, it claims that it was an essential element of Dr. Tse's job to obtain 100% extramural funding and that it would have been unreasonable for NYU to eliminate that [*49]  responsibility as an accommodation. Third, NYU argues that it had no obligation to provide Dr. Tse with lab assistance because she did not present a research project or idea for which she needed research support, and that provision of a lab assistant under such circumstances would have been an undue burden. Finally, NYU argues that it provided reasonable accommodations by continuing Dr. Tse's salary and supporting her application for LTD benefits.
As a preliminary matter, the Court construes Plaintiff's submissions liberally, interpreting them "to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest." Bryant v. Wright, 451 F. App'x 12, 13 (2d Cir. 2011)(emphasis in original)(citation omitted). See also In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 133 (2d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted) (A "party appearing without counsel is afforded extra leeway in meeting the procedural rules governing litigation," and district judges should "make some effort to protect a party so appearing from waiving a right . . . because of his or her lack of legal knowledge.") This "extra leeway," may involve construing a pro se litigant's pleadings and motions liberally, allowing amendments to a pro se litigant's pleadings more freely, and preventing a pro se litigant's rights from "be[ing] impaired by harsh application of technical [*50]  rules." Id. (citations omitted).
A. Legal Standard for Reasonable Accommodation Claim under the ADA
1. To make out a claim of discrimination based on the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, the Plaintiff must show:
(1) [P]laintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the [statute]; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of [her] disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations.
McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 2009).
2. In addition, "[t]erminating a disabled employee . . . who can perform the essential functions of the job but cannot return to work because the employer has denied his request for reasonable accommodation, is disability discrimination under the ADA." Parker v. Sony Pictures Entm't, Inc., 260 F.3d 100, 105 (2d Cir. 2001).
3. Among other means, reasonable accommodations may include:
modification of job duties and schedules, alteration of the facilities in which a job is performed, acquisition of devices to assist the performance of job duties, and, under certain circumstances, "reassignment to a vacant position."
McBride, 583 F.3d at 97 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B)).
4. Reasonable accommodations may also include hiring an assistant to help the disabled [*51]  employee. As the Second Circuit explained in Borkowski v. Valley Central School District, "an assistant to help with a job may be an accommodation" where the "provision of the [assistant] . . . does not eliminate an essential function, but rather permits the individual with a disability to perform that essential function." 63 F.3d 131, 140-41 (2d Cir. 1995)(noting that providing a reader for a visually impaired employee is a reasonable accommodation because "[w]hat matters to that individual's job is not the ability to read per se, but rather the ability to take in, process, and act on information.").
5. "The hallmark of a reasonable accommodation is effectiveness." Dean v. Univ. at Buffalo Sch. of Med. & Biomedical Scis., 804 F.3d 178, 189 (2d Cir. 2015). A reasonable "accommodation need not be 'perfect' or the one 'most strongly preferred'" by the plaintiff, but "it must be effective." Id. (quoting Noll v. IBM, 787 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir. 2015)).
6. "An ineffective 'modification' or 'adjustment' will not accommodate a disabled individual's limitations." Noll, 787 F.3d at 95 (citing US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 400, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002))(emphasis in original). In other words, "a reasonable accommodation is one that enables a disabled employee to perform the essential functions of a job." Francis v. Wyckoff Heights Med. Ctr., 177 F. Supp. 3d 754, 2016 WL 1273235, at *12 (E.D.N.Y. 2016)(citing Davis v. New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 508 F. App'x 26, 29 (2d Cir. 2013)(the ADA "affords a right to such reasonable accommodations as will allow the disabled individual to perform [essential] functions.")). [*52] 
7. The "ADA envisions an 'interactive process' by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated." McBride, 583 F.3d at 99. "That being said, the ADA imposes liability for, inter alia, discriminatory refusal to undertake a feasible accommodation, not mere refusal to explore possible accommodations where, in the end, no accommodation was possible." Id.
8. "[G]enerally, it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed." Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006).
9. The Second Circuit has explained that "[a]pplication of this general rule that a request for accommodation is a prerequisite to liability for failure to accommodate is not warranted, however, where the disability is obvious or otherwise known to the employer without notice from the employee." Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Felix v. New York City Transit Authority, 154 F.Supp.2d 640 (S.D.N.Y. 2001))(alteration omitted).
10. Therefore, "an employer has a duty reasonably to accommodate an employee's disability if the disability is obvious — which is to say, if the employer knew or reasonably should have known that the employee was disabled." Id.
11. In a reasonable accommodation case, "[t]he plaintiff bears the burdens of both production and persuasion [*53]  as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her employment, including the existence of a vacant position for which she is qualified." McBride, 583 F.3d at 97.
12. However, "with regard to the reasonableness of a proposed accommodation, a plaintiff bears only a light burden of production that is satisfied if the costs of the accommodation do not on their face obviously exceed the benefits. The burden of persuasion falls on the defendant employer." McBride, 583 F.3d at 97, n.3 (citing Jackan v. New York State DOL, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000); Borkowski, 63 F.3d at 138).
13. Thus, once a plaintiff identifies an accommodation that is "facially reasonable," the "burden of persuasion then shifts to the defendant to 'rebut the reasonableness of the proposed accommodation.'" Wright v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 831 F.3d 64, 2016 WL 4056036, at *7 (2d Cir. 2016)(citations omitted).
14. When considering whether a defendant has demonstrated that an accommodation poses an undue burden, and thus is unreasonable, the Court considers the following factors:
(i) the nature and cost of the accommodation needed under this chapter;
(ii) the overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodation; the number of persons employed at such facility; the effect on expenses and resources, or the impact otherwise of [*54]  such accommodation upon the operation of the facility;
(iii) the overall financial resources of the covered entity; the overall size of the business of a covered entity with respect to the number of its employees; the number, type, and location of its facilities; and
(iv) the type of operation or operations of the covered entity, including the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce of such entity; the geographic separateness, administrative, or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(10)(B).
B. Legal Standard for New York State and New York City Human Rights Law Claims
15. "New York State disability discrimination claims are governed by the same legal standards as federal ADA claims." Giambattista v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 584 F. App'x 23, 26 (2d Cir. 2014) (citing Rodal v. Anesthesia Grp. of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F. 3d 113, 117 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2004)); Gill v. Maul, 61 A.D.3d 1159, 876 N.Y.S.2d 751, 753 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009).
16. The New York City Human Rights Law provides broader protections than both the ADA and the NYSHRL. Jacobsen v. New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 22 N.Y.3d 824, 837, 988 N.Y.S.2d 86, 11 N.E.3d 159 (N.Y. 2014).
17. Additionally, "it is beyond dispute that the City Human Rights Law [] now explicitly requires an independent liberal construction analysis in all circumstances, an analysis that must be targeted to understanding and fulfilling what the statute characterizes as the [NYCHRL]'s uniquely broad and remedial purposes, which go beyond those [*55]  of counterpart State or federal civil rights laws." Bennett v. Health Mgt. Sys., 92 A.D.3d 29, 936 N.Y.S.2d 112, 116 (N.Y. App. Div. 2011)(internal quotations and citation omitted); see also Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 109 (2d Cir. 2013). The NYCHRL should be construed "broadly in favor of discrimination plaintiffs, to the extent that such a construction is reasonably possible." Id. (citations omitted).
18. Specifically, the NYCHRL defines "reasonable accommodation" more broadly than the ADA and NYSHRL as "such accommodation that can be made that shall not cause undue hardship in the conduct of the [employer's] business. The [employer] shall have the burden of proving undue hardship." NYCHRL § 8-102(18).
19. Thus, "under the NYCHRL, 'there are no accommodations that may be "unreasonable" if they do not cause undue hardship.'" Vangas v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., 6 F. Supp. 3d 400, 416 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing Phillips v. City of New York, 66 A.D.3d 170, 884 N.Y.S.2d 369, 378 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009)); see also Brooklyn Ctr. for Indep. of Disabled v. Bloomberg, 980 F. Supp. 2d 588, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).
20. Furthermore, "there is no accommodation (whether it be indefinite leave time or any other need created by a disability) that is categorically excluded from the universe of reasonable accommodation." Phillips, 884 N.Y.S.2d at 378.
C. Plaintiff's Reasonable Accommodation Claim under the ADA and NYSHRL
As to the first and second elements of a reasonable accommodation claim, it is undisputed that Plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA, NYSHRL and NYCHRL and that NYU is subject to the anti-discrimination [*56]  statutes. Additionally, on summary judgment, the Court found that the Plaintiff had established that she could perform her job with an accommodation, namely, provision of a laboratory assistant, as she had when she was the Core Director. (MSJ Opinion 31.)6 Therefore, at trial, Dr. Tse was required to prove that NYU was aware of her disability and need for accommodation, and that it failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. In light of the Findings of Fact set forth above, the Court makes the following Conclusions of Law.
1. NYU's Knowledge of Dr. Tse's Disability and Need for Accommodations as of June 1, 2010
21. Plaintiff has established that NYU was aware that she had a disability and that her disability and need for an accommodation was "obvious" to NYU. Brady, 531 F.3d at 135.
22. Since at least 2005, NYU was aware of Dr. Tse's disability, and Plaintiff notified Mr. Odom, Dr. Blaser, and others on multiple occasions that her disability prevented her from doing lab work. (See supra Findings of Fact ¶¶ 53-58, 61-63, 67-68.)
23. When Dr. Tse was removed from the Core Director position, she lost not only 65% of her funding, but also the accommodation of lab assistance she had previously been [*57]  provided through the CFAR grant. (Findings of Fact ¶ 4.)
24. Although it is undisputed that Dr. Tse did not ask for a reasonable accommodation after her removal from the Core position, because Dr. Tse's disability was "obvious" to NYU and NYU was aware that she lost the accommodation she had been provided previously in the Core, the "[a]pplication of this general rule that a request for accommodation is a prerequisite to liability for failure to accommodate is not warranted." Brady, 531 F.3d at 135.
25. Therefore, because NYU was aware of Dr. Tse's disability, it was required to engage in the "interactive process" with her to determine if there was a reasonable accommodation and if so, to provide such accommodation. McBride, 583 F.3d at 99.
26. The Court previously found that her removal from the Core and termination were not due to her disability or in retaliation for her complaining about discrimination. (MSJ Opinion at 38-39, 41-45.) Even though Dr. Tse's removal from the Core was permissible, NYU's obligation to provide Dr. Tse with a reasonable accommodation continued.
2. Potential Accommodations
27. "The reasonableness of an employer's accommodation is a 'fact-specific' question that often must be resolved by a factfinder." [*58]  Noll, 787 F.3d at 94 (citing Wernick v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., 91 F.3d 379, 385 (2d Cir. 1996)).
a. Lab Assistance
28. Plaintiff has made out her initial burden of demonstrating that the costs of provision of a lab assistant as an accommodation "do not on their face obviously exceed the benefits." McBride, 583 F.3d at 97, n.3.
29. Given the size of NYU's staff, the minimal expenditure of the lab assistant's salary of less than $40,000, and the fact that Dr. Tse had successfully funded her position and others' during years past when provided with lab assistance, the Court finds that the costs of hiring lab assistance did not obviously exceed the benefits. (See supra Findings of Fact ¶¶ 51, 81-83.)
30. Because Plaintiff made out her initial burden, the burden of proving that the accommodation was unduly burdensome shifted to NYU. McBride, 583 F.3d at 97, n.3.
31. NYU has failed to make out its burden that the cost of providing lab assistance to Dr. Tse was unduly burdensome.
32. NYU presented only minimal evidence about the burden that providing a lab assistance would have placed on it. NYU presented no evidence regarding the overall budgets of the NYU School of Medicine or, within that, the Department of Medicine or Center for AIDS Research, nor the impact of the cost of providing lab assistance to Dr. Tse on the overall functioning [*59]  or funding of any of these entities.
33. Dr. Abramson testified that at the time the REF Policy was put in place, NYU was paying out $20 million in salaries to researchers without grant funding, and that the REF Policy was an attempt to address shortfalls in research funding. (See supra Findings of Fact ¶¶ 25.) Similarly, Ms. Cribben discussed, in general terms, the financial uncertainty that NYU faced. (See id. ¶ 87.)
34. However, this testimony is not sufficient to demonstrate that the cost of a lab assistant, which would have helped Dr. Tse to apply for and secure funding to cover her position and others', was unreasonable.
35. Rather than putting forth evidence that the lab assistance would have been unduly burdensome, NYU has taken the position that the burden was on Dr. Tse to come up with an idea for research or solicit collaborations with other researchers before any obligation to provide her with a reasonable accommodation arose. NYU argued at trial that Dr. Tse "understood she had to get funding and there is two ways to get funding, you either do it on your own or you do it with collaborators, and if she did it with collaborators . . . there was no issue about whether or not [*60]  she was accommodated because she was, she did the analytical and the writing based on prior data." (Trial Tr. 451:7-12.) Thus, NYU argued that if Dr. Tse "collaborated with [principal investigators] who had money to fund the lab assistants, she was accommodated and she didn't have to do the lab work." (Trial Tr. 450:19-21.)
36. Defendant also argues that Dr. Tse "put the cart before the horse" by asking for lab assistance when she "did not present a single research idea to NYU for which she needed help in the laboratory."7 (Def.'s Proposed Conclusions of Law ¶ 15.) Seemingly in support of this argument, Mr. Cerasia asked Dr. Blaser and Mr. Odom a series of questions relating to whether Dr. Tse had ever come forward with a research proposal, which they answered in the negative. (Findings of Fact ¶¶ 88-89.)
37. Without any support in the record, NYU claims that it would violate "NYU's policies and practices that required a scientific idea or proposal to utilize the laboratory's services and personnel." (Def.'s Proposed Conclusions of Law ¶ 17.)
38. The Court finds no basis in the law for NYU's position and is struck by the apparent paradox it raises: NYU expected Dr. Tse to perform [*61]  her job functions without reasonable accommodations as a prerequisite to NYU's agreement to provide reasonable accommodations.8 While it may be the norm (though not a formal policy, on the record before this Court) to condition a non-tenured research professor's receipt of resources on her having an existing research idea, proposal or collaboration, such requirements make little sense in the ADA context, where the accommodation is needed to assist the employee in fulfilling those very conditions.
39. As the Court found above, Dr. Tse needed preliminary data to support any research proposals or ideas, and that due to her loss of manual dexterity, she could not gather that data without laboratory assistance. (See supra Findings of Fact ¶¶ 29-31.)
40. Instead of assisting Dr. Tse to collect the required data by providing her with lab assistance, NYU expected Dr. Tse to obtain the accommodations she needed on her own by soliciting collaborations with other researchers who already had funding and could provide lab assistants. (Id. ¶ 86.)
41. Even if Dr. Tse were able to find and collaborate on a funded project already in progress, she would not be able to increase her funding significantly [*62]  on that project without additional approval from the grantor. (Findings of Fact ¶ 50.)
42. The Court concludes that the ADA puts no such obligations on disabled individuals. Thus, the Court rejects any argument that Dr. Tse's purported failure to put forth a research idea or identify a collaboration was a condition precedent to NYU's obligation to provide reasonable accommodations.9
43. Even if Dr. Tse had such an obligation, the evidence establishes that she did continue to work on a research proposal and grant application with another researcher, Dr. Reibman, based on previously obtained preliminary data after her removal from the Core Director position. However, after that application was submitted in July 2010, Dr. Tse believed she had neither time nor the authority to continue on new research or an additional application because she understood that her faculty appointment would terminate at the end of August 2010. (See supra Findings of Fact ¶¶ 37-48.) Therefore, the Court finds that to the extent that Dr. Tse had any obligation to seek out collaborations and identify potential grant opportunities, she has satisfied it.
44. Though [*63]  NYU apparently intended to keep Dr. Tse on past May 31, 2010 and continue her salary, there is no evidence that anyone communicated that plan to Dr. Tse, nor disabused her of the notion that her appointment would be ending in August 2010. (See supra Findings of Fact ¶¶ 98.) Thus, it is entirely understandable that Dr. Tse would not put forth an additional research proposal requiring lab assistance after July 2010 when she believed that she would be out of work weeks later.
45. Weighing the factors laid out in 42 U.S.C. § 12111(10)(B), including the large size of the NYU School of Medicine and number of people employed there, and the comparatively small cost - under $40,000 - of hiring an additional lab assistant, the Court finds that providing lab assistance to Dr. Tse was not an undue burden on NYU.
46. NYU has presented no contrary evidence nor demonstrated that it even conducted an internal analysis to determine whether the lab assistance would have been unduly burdensome. See Matos v. MTA Bridges & Tunnels, No. 04 CV 768 (SJ), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25332, 2008 WL 858995, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2008) (denying defendant's motion for summary judgment where the employer "conceded that she did not perform an analysis as to the cost of providing Plaintiff with an escort, nor could she state whether or not providing an escort would [*64]  present a hardship, economic or otherwise.")
47. As noted previously, the Second Circuit has made clear that an assistant may be a reasonable accommodation, and that:
there is nothing inherently unreasonable or undue in the burden that an employer would assume by providing an assistant to an employee with disabilities; the regulations clearly contemplate, and courts have held, that employers may be required to assume the cost of providing assistants for otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities absent a showing by the employer that the cost is excessive in light of the factors enumerated in the regulations.
Borkowski, 63 F.3d at 140-41.
48. Accordingly, the Court finds that lab assistance was a reasonable accommodation, and that NYU failed to provide it to Dr. Tse.
b. Salary Continuation
49. NYU argues that it provided an accommodation by allowing Dr. Tse to stay on as Associate Research Professor and continuing her full salary for ten months after being removed from the Core Director position and losing the extramural funding that accompanied it. (Def.'s Proposed Conclusions of Law ¶ 21.) However, this action does not constitute a reasonable accommodation for several reasons.
50. First, as Dr. Tse testified [*65]  at trial (and as common sense dictates), salary continuation for any period of time, without laboratory assistance, would not enable Dr. Tse to conduct the laboratory experiments necessary to generate preliminary data. (See supra Findings of Fact ¶¶ 105-106.) She suffered from chronic conditions that neither time nor money alone would resolve. Instead, she required assistance to perform certain tasks required for her job, namely, experiments requiring manual dexterity. Because salary continuation did not assist Dr. Tse in performing a task she would otherwise be unable to do due to her disability, salary continuation cannot be said to be an "effective" accommodation to her disability. Noll, 787 F.3d at 94.
51. Second, the testimony at trial established that ten months would not have been sufficient for most faculty, even tenure-track faculty, to raise the required extramural funding needed to maintain a research professor position. (See supra Findings of Fact ¶¶ 103-104.) It took Dr. Abramson, a seasoned researcher, six months to complete his most recent grant application, and could take another six to nine months for the review and award process to be carried out. (Id. ¶¶ 32-35; Def.'s Proposed Findings [*66]  of Fact ¶ 82.)
52. Thus, the ten months of salary continuation provided to Dr. Tse would not likely have been sufficient for her to obtain the required extramural funding.
53. Third, it was not clear to NYU how long they would continue paying and it certainly was not clear to Dr. Tse. NYU never communicated to Dr. Tse its intention to keep her on salary after her removal from the Core Director position. (Id. ¶¶ 97-99.) Having no information to the contrary, Dr. Tse reasonably acted on the assumption that she would be losing the majority of her salary as of May 31, 2010, and that her faculty appointment would expire on August 31, 2010. (Id. ¶¶ 100-102.)
54. The Court recognizes that NYU guarantees different levels of salary support and employment security to tenured faculty as compared to non-tenured faculty, who serve as at-will employees with annual appointments. (Id. ¶ 1, 21, 26.) The Court also recognizes that despite its general policy of giving non-tenured faculty members three months' notice of their termination, it allowed Dr. Tse to remain on faculty and paid her salary for approximately ten months after removing her from the Core.
55. There was no guarantee that Dr. Tse would [*67]  continue to receive salary support. Further, NYU never told Dr. Tse that it considered her continued salary as the accommodation for her disability. The continued salary did not restore her ability to perform her job functions. Accordingly, NYU's salary continuation cannot be considered an accommodation for her disability. The Court finds that NYU's provision of salary support to Dr. Tse for ten months after her removal from the Core Director position was not a reasonable accommodation.
c. Assistance with LTD Benefits Application
56. NYU's assistance to Dr. Tse in her application for LTD benefits cannot be considered an accommodation.
57. Although the Second Circuit has not resolved the issue of whether paid or unpaid leave can constitute a reasonable accommodation, see Petrone v. Hampton Bays Union Free School District, 568 F. App'x 5, 7 n.2 (2d Cir. 2014), some Courts in this Circuit have held that medical leave may constitute a reasonable accommodation in some circumstances. However, such leave is only considered an accommodation if it is finite in term, and will assist the employee in returning to her work duties. Graves, 457 F.3d at 186.
58. Neither of those circumstances was present here. NYU did not engage in any discussion with Dr. Tse about the potential of her returning to work after [*68]  she began receiving LTD benefits, despite her having raised the idea in her email to Mr. Odom. Although Dr. Tse made clear her desire to keep working, she was told that disability benefits was "all or none." Therefore, rather than enabling her to continue working, she could only begin receiving LTD benefits once she was no longer on NYU's payroll. The LTD application represented a permanent departure from employment at NYU, not a temporary leave. (See supra Findings of Fact ¶¶ 114-115, 121.) Therefore, full-time disability leave which, by definition, does not contemplate a return to work, cannot be an accommodation. 10
59. Additionally, just as the salary continuation did not restore Dr. Tse's ability to perform her job functions, nor did her obtaining LTD benefits. Dr. Tse's receipt of LTD benefits did not improve her condition in any way or assist her in carrying out laboratory experiments. Thus, assisting Dr. Tse in applying for LTD benefits cannot be considered an effective form of accommodation.
60. NYU's suggestion that Dr. Tse wished to go on LTD rather than continue to work with reasonable accommodations, is also unsupported by the record. Dr. Tse's May 14, 2010 email to Mr. Odom, [*69]  which followed her request to go on long term disability leave, stated that "[t]he 65% leave or loss of income may decrease or increase as positions with ADA accommodations at [NYU School of Medicine] is opened or closed, and will require adjustment over time." (Id. ¶ 63.) This clearly demonstrates that Dr. Tse viewed LTD as a temporary solution to cover her lost income, but that she wished to work if accommodations or other positions became available.
61. Additionally, at the August 2010 meeting, Dr. Tse asked to remain on faculty part time so that she could continue to apply for grant funding. (Id. ¶ 7.)
62. Further, the fact that Dr. Tse continued to collaborate with other researchers at NYU after her removal from the Core Director position and after her termination from NYU, demonstrates that she intended to, and indeed did, continue her research when laboratory assistance was available. (Id. ¶ 52.) 11
63. Finally, the fact that Dr. Tse ultimately decided to apply for LTD benefits does not mean that she "withdrew from the interactive process," as NYU argues. (Def.'s Proposed Conclusions of Law ¶ 24.) Dr. Tse repeatedly testified that she decided to go on LTD benefits because NYU did [*70]  not provide any accommodations to her and presented LTD benefits as an "option," and indeed the only one, if she could not raise her REF. (Findings of Fact ¶¶ 64, 73, 109-111.) NYU admitted that they preferred the LTD option. (Id. ¶ 121.)
64. Therefore, the Court finds that NYU's assistance to Dr. Tse in her application for LTD benefits through Unum does not qualify as a reasonable accommodation, and that Dr. Tse did not "withdraw from the interactive process."
65. In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated that the provision of lab assistance was a reasonable accommodation, and that salary continuation and assistance in applying for LTD benefits were not reasonable accommodations.
66. It is undisputed that NYU failed to provide Dr. Tse with lab assistance, and the Court finds that NYU did not prove that the provision of lab assistance would be an undue burden. Because NYU did not provide this or any other reasonable accommodations to Dr. Tse during the period of June 1, 2010 to April 4, 2011, the Court finds that NYU is liable under the ADA and the NYSHRL for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation.
D. Plaintiff's Reasonable Accommodation Claim under the NYCHRL
67. Discrimination [*71]  claims brought under the NYCHRL must be analyzed separately from their federal and state counterparts, taking into consideration the "uniquely broad and remedial purposes," of the New York City Human Rights Law.
68. The Court finds that Dr. Tse has also made out her failure to accommodate claim under the NYCHRL. A plaintiff prevails under the NYCHRL where the defendant does not prove that an accommodation would cause it an undue burden.
69. Here, as explained in the Court's analysis of Plaintiff's ADA claims, NYU has failed to demonstrate that hiring a lab assistant would constitute an undue burden, given the estimated cost of the assistant's salary, size of NYU as an organization, and the funding support and research success that Dr. Tse has brought to NYU in the past.
70. For the reasons explained above, the Court finds that salary continuation and assistance applying for LTD benefits are also not reasonable accommodations under the NYCHRL. Thus, given the Court's finding that NYU was liable under the ADA and NYSHRL, and the broader reach of the NYCHRL, it follows that NYU is also liable under the NYCHRL. See Brooklyn Ctr. for Indep. of Disabled, 980 F. Supp. 2d at 643.
IV. Damages
Having found Defendant NYU liable for violation of the ADA, NYSHRL, [*72]  and NYCHRL for failure to provide reasonable accommodations from June 1, 2010 to April 4, 2011, the Court must now consider the issue of damages.
A. Legal Standards
1. Back Pay, Reinstatement, and Front Pay "The ADA provides that a successful plaintiff shall have available the same remedies that would be available to a plaintiff pursuant to Title VII." Rosso v. Pi Mgmt. Assocs., L.L.C., No. 02 Civ. 1702 (KNF), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35862, 2005 WL 3535060, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2005) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a)). Therefore, back pay, reinstatement, and front pay are available in disability discrimination cases. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g); N.Y. Exec. Law § 297(4)(c); N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-120; Picinich v. United Parcel Serv., 318 F. App'x 34, 36 (2d Cir. 2009) ("Remedies available to the victims of discrimination are committed to the sound discretion of the district court.") (quoting Carrero v. N.Y.C. Housing Auth., 890 F.2d 569, 579-80 (2d Cir. 1989)) (ADA and NYSHRL).
The purpose of back pay is to make a plaintiff whole, that is, to "completely redress the economic injury the plaintiff has suffered as a result of discrimination." Saulpaugh v. Monroe Cmty. Hosp., 4 F.3d 134, 145 (2d Cir. 1993)(internal quotations and citation omitted). "This award should therefore consist of lost salary, including anticipated raises, and fringe benefits." Id. In general, a plaintiff in an employment discrimination case is entitled to back pay from the date of the discrimination through the date of judgment. Id. at 144.
"In deciding whether an award of front pay is appropriate, a court should consider (1) whether reinstatement [*73]  [is] either impossible or impracticable (2) whether the plaintiff has a reasonable prospect of obtaining comparable employment; and (3) whether the calculation of front pay would involve undue speculation." Shannon v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 136 F. Supp. 2d 225, 233 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)(internal quotations and citations omitted).
a. Offset of Back Pay
The Second Circuit has made clear that the decision to offset a lost wages award in an employment discrimination case by payments received from third parties "rests in the sound discretion of the district court." Dailey v. Societe Generale, 108 F.3d 451, 460 (2d Cir. 1997)(holding that district court had discretion to decline to deduct unemployment insurance benefits from damages award); Ramey v. Dist. 141, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, 362 F. App'x 212, 217 (2d Cir. 2010)(holding that district court had discretion to decline to offset severance and unemployment payments from damages award). In Dailey, the Second Circuit reiterated that "[w]hile collateral source payments do represent an additional benefit to the plaintiff, . . . '[a]s between the employer, whose action caused the discharge, and the employee, who may have experienced other noncompensable losses, it is fitting that the burden be placed on the employer.'" Id. (quoting Promisel v. First Am. Artificial Flowers, Inc., 943 F.2d 251, 258 (2d Cir. 1991)). "The theory behind the rule is that, in fairness, the wrongdoer should not benefit because the plaintiff enjoyed independent contractual [*74]  or employment rights to reimbursement for damages." Siracuse v. Program for the Dev. of Human Potential, No. 07 CV 2205 CLP, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73456, 2012 WL 1624291, at *12 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2012)(citing Kish v. Bd. of Ed. of the City of N.Y., 76 N.Y.2d 379, 384, 558 N.E.2d 1159, 559 N.Y.S.2d 687 (N.Y. 1990)).
b. Pre-judgment Interest
"In a suit to enforce a federal right, the question of whether or not to award prejudgment interest is ordinarily left to the discretion of the district court, which is to take into consideration (i) the need to fully compensate the wronged party for actual damages suffered, (ii) considerations of fairness and the relative equities of the award, (iii) the remedial purpose of the statute involved, and/or (iv) such other general principles as are deemed relevant by the court." Gierlinger v. Gleason, 160 F.3d 858, 873 (2d Cir. 1998)(internal quotations and citations omitted). Indeed, "[t]o the extent . . . that the damages awarded to the plaintiff represent compensation for lost wages, 'it is ordinarily an abuse of discretion not to include pre-judgment interest.'" Id. (quoting Saulpaugh, 4 F.3d at 145). "[J]udgments that are based on both state and federal law with respect to which no distinction is drawn shall have applicable interest calculated at the federal interest rate." Thomas v. iStar Fin., Inc., 652 F.3d 141, 150 (2d Cir. 2011).
2. Emotional Distress and Punitive Damages
A plaintiff suing under the ADA, NYSHRL or NYCHRL may be entitled to compensatory damages, including recovery for "emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental [*75]  anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-pecuniary losses." 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981a(a)(2) & (b)(3); Caravantes v. 53rd St. Partners, LLC, No. 09 CIV. 7821 RPP, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120182, 2012 WL 3631276, at *22 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 23, 2012) (NYSHRL and NYCHRL).
However, in reasonable accommodation cases, compensatory damages "may not be awarded . . . where the covered entity demonstrates good faith efforts, in consultation with the person with the disability who has informed the covered entity that accommodation is needed, to identify and make a reasonable accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(3).
An ADA plaintiff may also recover punitive damages if the plaintiff demonstrates that the defendant "engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference" to the plaintiff's rights. 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(1). In this context, the employer need not be aware that it is engaging in discrimination or engage in "egregious" or "outrageous" conduct, but "an employer must at least discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law to be liable in punitive damages." Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 536, 119 S. Ct. 2118, 144 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1999). The amount of compensatory and punitive damages are limited depending on the size of the defendant employer. For defendants with more than 500 employees, compensatory damages under this section are limited to $300,000. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981a(b)(3)(D).
3. Attorney's Fees
In addition, attorney's [*76]  fees are available at the discretion of the judge in cases arising under the ADA and NYCHRL. 42 U.S.C. § 12205 ("In any action or administrative proceeding commenced pursuant to this chapter, the court or agency, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee, including litigation expenses, and costs, and the United States shall be liable for the foregoing the same as a private individual."); N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-502(g) ("[T]he court, in its discretion, may award the prevailing party reasonable attorney's fees, expert fees and other costs.") 12
In calculating attorney's fees, the "starting point for the determination of a reasonable fee is the calculation of the lodestar amount." Quaratino v. Tiffany & Co., 166 F.3d 422, 425 (2d Cir. 1999)(citing Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983)). The Court should exclude "hours dedicated to severable unsuccessful claims," but "[a]ttorney's fees may be awarded for unsuccessful claims as well as successful ones . . . where they are inextricably intertwined and involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories." Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted); see also Hines v. City of Albany, 613 F. App'x 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2015). This determination is not an "exact science," and "should be guided by the degree of success obtained, rather than by 'a mathematical [*77]  approach comparing the total number of issues in the case with those actually prevailed upon.'" G.B. ex rel. N.B. v. Tuxedo Union Free Sch. Dist., 894 F.Supp.2d 415, 425-26 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)(citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435 n.11).
In exercising its discretion, "the district court is not obligated to undertake a line-by-line review of [the prevailing party's] extensive fee application." Marion S. Mishkin Law Office v. Lopalo, 767 F.3d 144, 150 (2d Cir. 2014). Rather, it may "use a percentage deduction as a practical means of trimming fat." Id. (citing McDonald v. Pension Plan of the NYSA-ILA Pension Trust Fund, 450 F.3d 91, 96 (2d Cir. 2006)).
B. Plaintiff's Damages
Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $716,618.00 in back pay for the period April 5, 2011 through July 31, 2016 (the "Proposed Back Pay Period"), including $585,131.00 in lost wages and $131,487.00 in fringe benefits, front pay in the amount of $300,000.00, damages for emotional distress, punitive damages in the amount of $300,000.00, attorney's fees in the amount of $176,381.00, and pre-judgment interest.
1. Back Pay
Plaintiff calculated her requested back pay award by beginning with her last annual salary at NYU, $104,058.00, and increasing it beginning in 2012 by the cost of living adjustment ("COLA") used by the Social Security Administration in its calculation of SSDI and Social Security Retirement benefits. (Trial Exs. 62a, 62d.) With the COLA increases, Plaintiff's total salary calculation for the [*78]  Proposed Back Pay Period is $585,131.00. (Trial Ex. 62a.)
In calculating the damages due to Plaintiff, the Court declines to apply the COLA increase applied by the SSA because Plaintiff has not established that her salary, which was primarily grant-based, would have been subject to a COLA increase had she remained employed at NYU. In addition, the Court declines to attribute 100% of Plaintiff's lost income to NYU for several reasons.
a. Required Extramural Funding
First, based on the evidence at trial, NYU was never required to cover 100% of Dr. Tse's salary. Dr. Tse's understanding was that research professors in her position were required to support some percentage of their salary each year with extramural funding, at a minimum of 50%, 55%, and 60% in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively, as set forth in the REF Policy. (Findings of Fact ¶¶ 11-12.) In addition to the evidence at trial, this Court previously found this to be undisputed, based on Defendant's own submissions at summary judgment, including a Declaration from Lucy Cribben. (MSJ Opinion at 12-13; see Trial Ex. 30.)
Despite this finding, NYU argues that Dr. Tse was required to raise 100% of her salary from extramural funding, [*79]  and thus that it should be liable for none of that as back pay. However, the Court rejects this argument. Dr. Abramson testified at trial that the percentages in the REF Policy were a "floor requirement but a chair may set it higher." (Findings of Fact ¶¶ 13, 25.) He explained that the REF Policy applied to both tenured and non-tenured faculty, though it was "primarily for tenured faculty." (Id. ¶ 10.) Thus, he explained, the REF Policy was intended to give department chairs discretion "because the non-tenured faculty are faculty at-will and the chair has to make a decision, depending on their ability to get extramural funding, or be collaborative scientists with other funded scientists, how much that person needs to bring in on their own with regard to the extramural funding requirement." (Id. ¶ 21.) Dr. Blaser testified that Dr. Tse was required to fund 100% of her salary through extramural support. (Id. ¶ 17.) Additionally, Dr. Abramson testified that he did not know about Dr. Blaser's policy specifically, but that "he, like other chairs, expected non-tenured faculty members to cover 100 percent of their salary." (Id. ¶ 22.)
Even if it were true that NYU's policy required that all [*80]  non-tenured faculty members raise 100% of their salaries in extramural funding, the Court finds that the testimonies of Dr. Blaser and Dr. Abramson are insufficient to establish that Dr. Tse was subject to the 100% REF, rather than the 50%, 55% or 60% requirements. Indeed, the evidence at trial points to the opposite conclusion. In addition to the REF Policy, which stated the lower percentages, Plaintiff presented a September 18, 2009 letter from Dr. Blaser to Dr. Tse, which indicated that her REF beginning in September 2008 was 50% percent, that she had met that REF by supporting 100% of her salary with outside funding, and congratulating her for her accomplishments. (Id. ¶ 15.) Dr. Tse testified that the she found out about the annual REF through that and other similar letters, and that those letters only advised her "after the fact" about the REF for the previous year and whether she had met it. (Id. ¶ 16.) When confronted with the letter, Dr. Blaser could not explain why it contained a lower REF, stating only that it was an "error." (Id. ¶ 18.) The Court does not find this explanation acceptable.
NYU provided no evidence at trial that Dr. Tse was ever informed that she was subject [*81]  to a higher REF than the ones listed in the REF Policy. Dr. Blaser testified that he was unaware of whether any corrective letter was sent to Dr. Tse to inform her about the correct REF. (Id. ¶ 19.) When Dr. Abramson was asked whether he knew how Dr. Blaser's expectations that non-tenured professors raise 100% of their salary was communicated to faculty, he answered that he "[didn]'t know that he's under any school-wide obligation to have that specific discussion," and that such discussions occur "when things get down to that kind of level that it becomes a crisis, both for the individual and the department, frankly." (Id. ¶ 23.) Thus, even if it was NYU's policy that non-tenured faculty members were subject to the 100% REF, Dr. Tse was not informed of it, and thus should not be held to it now.
Accordingly, for the purposes of determining back pay owed to Dr. Tse, the Court finds that Dr. Tse was required to raise 50%, 55%, and 60%, in the years 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively and thus NYU was required to support 50%, 45%, and 40% of Dr. Tse's salary in those years. The Court assumes that for the years after 2011, the 2011 rate applies, and NYU was required to cover 40% of Dr. Tse's [*82]  salary during those years.
b. Certainty of Grant Funding
In addition, in calculating back pay, the Court takes into account the uncertainty about whether Dr. Tse would have been able to secure the required extramural funding to support her position throughout the Proposed Back Pay Period, even assuming that NYU provided reasonable accommodations. As found above, the grant application process is an unpredictable and competitive one, with only 10% of NIH grant applications being funded. (Findings of Fact ¶ 36.) On the other hand, Dr. Tse had obtained consistent grant funding in the past, was in the process of completing a "competitive renewal" with Dr. Reibman to renew a project on which they were already working, and continued to do research and publish academic papers after her termination with accommodations (i.e., other people performing lab work). Additionally, it would have taken Dr. Tse approximately a year and a half, with reasonable accommodations provided, to obtain new grant funding after being removed from the Core. Therefore, the Court finds that the award of NYU's portion of her back pay for a period of two years ("Back Pay Period") is justified on the facts of this case. [*83]  Dr. Tse's salary for two years, without a COLA increase, would have been $208,116.00. (Trial Ex. 62a n.1.) Accordingly, NYU's portion of the back pay, 40%, is $83,246.40.
c. Offset with Disability Benefits Received
As noted earlier, Dr. Tse applied for and received LTD benefits from NYU's third-party insurer, Unum, and SSDI benefits, which later transitioned to Social Security Retirement benefits when Dr. Tse turned 65 years old. Defendant NYU, in its pre-trial Motion in Limine, sought a finding from the Court that Dr. Tse was not entitled to recover from NYU the amount that she received from Unum and the SSA in benefit payments, and that her total recovery should be offset by that amount. The Court denied that Motion, holding that whether to offset a damages award with disability benefits received from a third-party insurer was a question left to the discretion of the Court, and one which the Court declined to rule upon at that time.
The evidence at trial established that Dr. Tse's Unum policy entitled her to 60% of her salary in LTD benefits. (Findings of Fact ¶ 127.) This amount was offset when she began to receive SSDI and later Social Security Retirement benefits. Thus, the total [*84]  amount she received from both Unum and SSA remained at 60% of her previous salary. (Id. ¶ 128.)
Plaintiff indicated at trial that she was not seeking recovery for the amounts that she received from Unum and the SSA over the period in question. Additionally, as noted above, NYU was only required to pay 40% of Dr. Tse's salary during the relevant period. Because she received 60% of her salary from disability benefits, a damages award of 40% of her salary during the Back Pay Period is sufficient to make Plaintiff whole.
Thus, NYU's portion of the back pay for the two-year Back Pay Period is $83,246.40.
d. Fringe Benefits
In addition to her lost salary, Dr. Tse seeks recovery for fringe benefits totaling $131,487.00. (Trial Ex. 62a.) This number is based on Dr. Tse's computation of all of the costs she expended out-of-pocket during her Proposed Back Pay Period to cover benefits she claims would have been covered by NYU had she been employed there. 13 NYU did not object to the calculation of those benefits at trial. However, in its Proposed Conclusions of Law, NYU points out that Dr. Tse is only entitled to the difference between what she would have paid in premiums and other fees as an employee [*85]  of NYU and what she actually paid, rather than her total expenditures on fringe benefits. (Def.'s Proposed Conclusions of Law ¶ 31.)
Fringe benefits are available as part of back pay, and the Court finds it appropriate here. However, because Dr. Tse would have paid premiums and other fees associated with some of her benefits had she remained an employee of NYU, the Court agrees with the Defendant that Dr. Tse is only entitled to the difference between what she would have contributed as an employee and what she actually paid in benefits after her termination. In addition, the Court only awards fringe benefits for the Back Pay Period of two years, for the reasons stated above.
While employed at NYU, Dr. Tse contributed $409.75 per month for health care, $51.75 per month for dental, and $165.58 for long term care benefits. (Trial Ex. 62b.) After her termination, Dr. Tse paid $769.00 per month for health care through COBRA and $168.00 per month for long term care benefits. (Trial Ex. 62a.) During the two-year Back Pay Period, Dr. Tse paid $22,488.00 in combined health care and long term care benefits, whereas she would have paid $15,049.92 during that time had she been employed at NYU and [*86]  paying premiums. Accordingly, she is entitled to the difference, or $7,438.08 for the two-year Back Pay Period.
e. Pre-judgment Interest
The Court finds that pre-judgment interest on Dr. Tse's back pay award, including reimbursement for fringe benefits, is necessary to compensate her fully for lost wages and benefits and to satisfy the remedial purpose of the anti-discrimination statutes. The Court calculates pre-judgment interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961. Accordingly, the interest rate applicable to Dr. Tse's damages is the weekly average one-year constant maturity Treasury yield for the week preceding judgment, compounded annually. Id.; see Thomas v. iStar Fin., Inc., 508 F.Supp.2d 252, 264 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). The Clerk of Court is directed to use this methodology to calculate the interest on the back pay award.
f. Calculation of Back Pay Award
In sum, the total back pay award for lost salary and fringe benefits for the two-year Back Pay Period is $90,684.48. As directed above, the Clerk of Court will calculate the pre-judgment interest due for this amount. 14
g. Tax Liability
Dr. Tse also seeks a damages award to offset the increased income tax liability she will incur by obtaining a lump sum back pay award. (Plf.'s Post-Trial Memorandum at 21-22; Trial Ex. 62a.) The [*87]  Second Circuit has not addressed whether a plaintiff may be compensated for the additional tax burden incurred through lump sum payments of back pay. In the absence of such guidance, some Courts in this Circuit have awarded additional damages for increased tax liability, while others have declined to do so. Compare Gulino v. Bd. of Educ., No. 96-CV-8414 (KMW), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102216, 2016 WL 4129111, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2016) ("a tax gross-up is appropriate when necessary to make a claimant whole"); Castelluccio v. IBM, No. 3:09CV1145 TPS, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100058, 2014 WL 3696371, at *1 (D. Conn. July 23, 2014) (awarding compensation for increased tax liability) with Morgenstern v. County of Nassau, No. CV 04-58 (ARL), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116602, 2009 WL 5103158, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2009) (declining to award damages for increased taxes). However, the Third, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits have held that a district court may, in its discretion, grant a prevailing employee additional compensation to cover the increased tax burden a back pay award may create, where such an award is necessary to make a plaintiff whole. See Eshelman v. Agere Sys., Inc., 554 F.3d 426, 441-42 (3d Cir. 2009); EEOC v. Northern Star Hospitality, Inc., 777 F.3d 898, 904 (7th Cir. 2015); E.E.O.C. v. Beverage Distributors Co., LLC, 780 F.3d 1018, 1023 (10th Cir. 2015).
Even if such an award were permissible in the Second Circuit, Dr. Tse has not put forth sufficient evidence for the Court to determine her expected increased tax liability. Her only submission on the topic was her proposed Trial Exhibit 64g, which set forth the rates of taxation for different income brackets. However, it was not admitted [*88]  at trial. Even if it were, it does not provide any insight into what Dr. Tse's total income or tax bracket would have been with and without the lump sum payment awarded today. Furthermore, the Court's award of damages today is not significantly higher than Dr. Tse's previous annual salary at NYU. Thus, it is not clear to the Court that Dr. Tse will, indeed, be subject to additional tax liability due to this lump sum payment. Therefore, on the facts of this case, the Court finds that an award to cover Dr. Tse's potential additional tax burden is not necessary to make Plaintiff whole, and is thus DENIED.
2. Front Pay/Reinstatement
In addition, Dr. Tse seeks reinstatement and/or front pay in the amount of $300,000.00. As noted, in considering whether an award of front pay is appropriate, the Court should consider "(1) whether reinstatement [is] either impossible or impracticable (2) whether the plaintiff has a reasonable prospect of obtaining comparable employment; and (3) whether the calculation of front pay would involve undue speculation." Shannon, 136 F.Supp.2d at 233 (internal quotations and citations omitted).
Plaintiff presented no evidence on the possibility of reinstatement, such as the availability of similar [*89]  positions at NYU. While she did present evidence that she has continued to collaborate with some of her former NYU research colleagues, she testified that she has continued to apply for comparable positions in the New York area and has found none that match her skills and experience. (Tse Tr. 409:22-410:2.) Thus, it is not clear to the Court that reinstatement would be practicable or that Dr. has a reasonable prospect of finding alternative employment. These findings would seem to weigh in favor of granting an award of front pay.
However, the Court finds the calculation of front pay to be unduly speculative. As a non-tenured researcher, her appointment could be discontinued and her position could be terminated at any time for any non-discriminatory reason. The testimony at trial established that it was very rare, if not unheard of, for a research professor to be kept on the faculty with only 5% extramural funding. As noted, the testimony also established that obtaining outside grant funding is an arduous, competitive, and unpredictable endeavor. Thus, the Court is not convinced that even had NYU provided the reasonable accommodations which would have enabled Dr. Tse to collect preliminary [*90]  data in her lab and apply for grant funding, that she would have gotten grant funding to support her position for years into the future. Accordingly, Plaintiff's request for reinstatement and/or front pay is DENIED.
3. Emotional Distress and Punitive Damages
The Court finds that neither compensatory damages for emotional distress nor punitive damages are warranted in this case. As noted above, a defendant in a reasonable accommodation is shielded from compensatory damages where it has made a good faith effort to accommodate the employee. The Court finds that NYU did not act in good faith in seeking to accommodate Dr. Tse. Dr. Tse made her needs clear to multiple people in her Department and the NYU administration. Instead of exploring potential accommodations which would allow Dr. Tse to continue to work, NYU kept Dr. Tse in the dark about the future of her position and salary at NYU, and ushered her onto LTD benefits and out of employment. Accordingly, the Court finds that compensatory damages may be available in this case.
Nevertheless, Dr. Tse failed to put forth sufficient evidence at trial to support a finding that emotional distress damages are warranted. Although the Court does [*91]  not discount the stress that the uncertainty of her circumstances caused to Dr. Tse, she did not support her testimony with any medical documentation about the impact of NYU's conduct on her physical or emotional well-being. The Court has no basis for assessing the degree or extent of her emotional distress, and thus finds no basis for awarding compensatory damages for emotional distress.
Similarly, there is no basis in the record for imposing punitive damages on NYU. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that NYU denied Dr. Tse a reasonable accommodation out of malice or reckless indifference. While not an effective accommodation, NYU did continue to pay Dr. Tse's full salary for ten months before terminating her. Nor does the record support a finding of recklessness. Therefore, the Court cannot say that NYU acted egregiously or that it acted "in the face of a perceived risk that its actions [would] violate federal law." Kolstad, 527 U.S. at 536. Accordingly, Plaintiff's requests for compensatory damages for emotional distress and punitive damages are DENIED.
4. Attorney's Fees
Dr. Tse seeks attorney's fees and costs for the full amount paid to her first set of attorneys from March 2009 through February 2012. [*92]  15 Defendant argues that Dr. Tse initially brought a number of claims in addition to the remaining one, which were dismissed on summary judgment, and thus she is only entitled to fees on her prevailing claim. (Def.'s Proposed Conclusions of Law ¶¶ 39-41.)
The Court finds that Dr. Tse is the prevailing party on her reasonable accommodation claim for the period June 1, 2010 to April 4, 2011, and is thus entitled to attorney's fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12205. NYU is correct that Plaintiff was only successful on this one claim, and cannot be said to be the prevailing party on all of them. 16 However, the Court finds that her successful and unsuccessful claims were "inextricably intertwined and involve a common core of facts" such that the award of a significant portion of her attorney's fees is appropriate. Quaratino, 166 F.3d at 426 (internal quotations and citations omitted); see also Wilson v. Nomura Sec. Int'l, Inc., 361 F.3d 86, 90-91 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted) ("When a plaintiff fails to prove one of two overlapping claims — e.g. a discriminatory discharge — but prevails on the other — e.g. retaliation for complaining of discrimination — the plaintiff may recover fees for all the legal work."). For example, Plaintiff's hostile work environment claims are intertwined [*93]  with the reasonable accommodation claim because the denial of accommodations allegedly created a hostile environment for Dr. Tse. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 42, 49-50, 58.) In addition, the reasonable accommodation claim for the time period before she was removed from the Core shares a common core of facts with the post-removal claims, namely, NYU's awareness of Dr. Tse's disability and the type of accommodation she needed to successfully perform her job. Additionally, although she ultimately lost her claims related to her time as the Core Director, the fact that she received accommodations while Core Director and was able to work with those accommodations was essential to the disposition of the reasonable accommodation claim for the period June 1, 2010 to April 4, 2011. Such proof was required to satisfy the element of her ADA claim that she was qualified to perform her job with an accommodation.
Moreover, because the bulk of the work on the case, investigating the claims, drafting of the Complaint and Amended Complaint, and engaging in discovery, was the same for the unsuccessful hostile work environment and reasonable accommodation claims, and necessary for the success of the prevailing claim, [*94]  the Court finds it appropriate to award attorney's fees for that work. See Tran v. Tran, 67 F. App'x 40, 42-43 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing Dominic v. Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc., 822 F.2d 1249, 1259-60 (2d Cir. 1987)) (noting that courts consider "whether the time expended on all of the claims would, essentially, have been expended on any one of them"). 17
However, because a portion of the requested attorney's fees is for attorney time spent on Dr. Tse's New York State Division of Human Rights complaint, and is unrelated to the filing of her federal action, the Court subtracts fees for the time period March 18, 2009 through July 30, 2010 from the total award. 18 Accordingly, the total attorney's fee due to Dr. Tse is $134,643.18.
V. CONCLUSION
Accordingly, the Court finds that NYU is liable under the ADA, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation to Dr. Tse during the period June 1, 2010 to April 4, 2011. The Court awards Dr. Tse the following damages:
• Back pay for two years from her termination on April 5, 2011, which includes $83,246.40 in lost wages, and $7,438.08 in fringe benefits, for a total of $90,684.48;
• Pre-judgment interest for back pay pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961(a). The Clerk of Court is directed to use the methodology set forth above to calculate the interest on the back pay award;
• Attorney's [*95]  fees in the amount of $134,643.18, without interest.
After the proper calculation of pre-judgment interest, as described above, the Clerk of Court is directed to close the docket in this case.
SO ORDERED.
