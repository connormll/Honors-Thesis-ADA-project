Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This is a civil action initiated by the filing of a Complaint by pro se Plaintiff Jo Ann Allen ("Allen" or "Plaintiff") on January 30, 2018 (Doc. 1). Allen filed a Second Amended Complaint on January 31, 2019, which stands as the operative pleading in this matter. (Doc. 35). Allen's suit arises from her employment with Lackawanna County, a Defendant in this action, from 2006 until November of 2016. Specifically, Allen complains of alleged actions taken by the Defendants leading up to her termination, the circumstances surrounding her termination, and her post-termination unemployment compensation hearing.
The second amended complaint asserts causes of action under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1992 [*2]  (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et. seq.) ("ADA"), Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C.A. § 2601 et. seq.) ("FMLA"), the Fourteenth Amendment, and state tort law. Before the Court is a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's second amended complaint. (Doc. 36). For the reasons herein, the Court recommends that the motion be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

I. Background and Procedural History
Allen filed the initial complaint in this matter on January 30, 2018, alleging causes of action under the FMLA, the ADA, and state law against the following Defendants: 1) the Lackawanna County Board of Commissioners ("Lackawanna County" or "Employer"); 2) William Browning ("Browning"), Director of Health & Human Services at Lackawanna County; 3) Brian Loughney ("Loughney"), Deputy of Human Resources at Lackawanna County; 4) Colin Holmes ("Holmes"), Administrator; and 5) Matthew J. Carmody, Attorney ("Carmody"). (Doc. 1, at 2-3). These Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on February 21, 2018, (Doc. 6), along with a supporting brief on April 6, 2018. (Doc. 13). In response, Allen filed a "Simplification & Clarification of Amendments of Plaintiff's Claims," which the Court liberally construed as an amended complaint. (Doc. 18); (Doc. 19).
Defendants filed a second motion to dismiss on July 13, 2018 (Doc. 21), which the undersigned recommended [*3]  granting in part on January 11, 2019. (Doc. 29, at 23). The undersigned further recommended granting Allen leave to file a second amended complaint. (Doc. 29, at 23). Before the District Court ruled on the Report and Recommendation, however, Allen filed a document entitled "Magistrate Judge Ordered, Amended Complaint" on January 31, 2019. (Doc. 35); (Doc. 42, at 8). The Court deemed and accepted as this filing as her second amended complaint. (Doc. 43, at ¶ 5).
As alleged in the second amended complaint, Allen was employed as an Aging Care Manager at Lackawanna County during the time period relevant to this action. (Doc. 35, at 3). Allen alleges she satisfactorily performed the functions of her Aging Care Manager job from 2006 until her termination in 2016. (Doc. 35, at 9). Allen also asserts that she is a member of a protected class of disability, owing to her chronic and severe Osteoarthritis in her feet and knees, and susceptibility to sudden, unpredictable anxiety attacks. (Doc. 35, at 3; 6). Based on her Anxiety Disorder with Major Depression, Allen required FMLA intermittent leave. (Doc. 35, at 5). Allen further claims that Lackawanna County, Browning, Loughney, and Holmes each [*4]  knew of her mental and physical impairments due to externally observable equipment she used and her request for reasonable accommodations. (Doc. 35, at 6).
According to Allen, she was able to perform the essential functions of her Aging Care Manager job at Lackawanna County, with or without reasonable accommodations, during her employment tenure. (Doc. 35, at 9). Sometime prior to January 15, 2014, however, Allen's job duties were updated to require her to perform Priority Home Visits. (Doc. 35, at 8). On January 15, 2014, Holmes threatened Allen with insubordination and termination unless she performed Priority Home Visits. (Doc. 35, at 8). On September 25, 2014, Holmes charged Allen with a refusal to conduct three of her assigned Priority Home Visits, and ultimately suspended her without pay for three days in March of 2015. (Doc. 35, at 8).
On September 20, 2015, Browning issued Allen an infraction based on her deteriorating work performance. (Doc. 35, at 8). Browing offered Allen a different job in the same office, which would not require her to conduct the Home Visits but would have reduced her salary by five percent. (Doc. 35, at 8). Allen declined this offer and filed a charge [*5]  "with EEOC/PHRC" against Lackawanna County on January 8, 2016. (Doc. 35, at 7). Lackawanna County subsequently issued Pre-Termination Notices to Allen on April 25th, May 23rd, and June 27th, 2016. (Doc. 35, at 5).
Allen asserts that Lackawanna County approved her annual leave without issue until 2016. (Doc. 35, at 5). On July 18, 2016, Allen's employer enacted a new policy entitled "Return from Medical Leave with No Restrictions" and used this policy to "functionally demote" Allen. (Doc. 35, at 5). Specifically, this functional demotion deprived Allen of her Civil Service responsibilities and, on July 28, 2016, Lackawanna County replaced Allen with a younger, non-disabled, and less experienced employee named Kim Young.1 (Doc. 35, at 5). Allen filed an additional charge "with EEOC/PHRC" against Lackawanna County on August 7, 2016. (Doc. 35, at 7).
After Allen's FMLA Leave expired on October 5, 2016, she required further disability leave. (Doc. 35, at 7). While Plaintiff was out of the office on her further disability leave, Loughney "harassed" her with another Pre-Termination Notice on October 19, 2016. (Doc. 35, at 7). On October 28, 2016, Allen filed charges of FMLA Violations and Interference [*6]  against Lackawanna County. (Doc. 35, at 5). Loughney sent an additional Pre-Termination Notice on November 1, 2016. (Doc. 35, at 7). On November 3, 2016, Allen made a request to her Employer, Lackawanna County, for a reasonable accommodation in her long-distance walking.2 (Doc. 35, at 3). Bolstering Allen's request for accommodation, Dr. Tomasjewski, an orthopedic physician, submitted his certification of Allen's need for a reasonable accommodation to Defendants.3 (Doc. 35, at 9). Allen returned to work on November 10, 2016. (Doc. 35, at 7).
On November 14, 2016 Lackawanna County held an interactive process meeting with Allen but did not discuss any reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 35, at 3). At about 4:20 PM on November 18, 2018, Lackawanna County informed Allen of her immediate discharge. (Doc. 35, at 3). Allen asserts her exercise of rights protected by the ADA caused her termination. (Doc. 35, at 3; 10). On November 21, 2016, Defendants issued a letter to Allen which stated her termination mooted her request for reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 35, at 10).
After her employment ended, Allen sought unemployment compensation. (Doc. 35, at 4-5). On January 31, 2017, an unemployment compensation [*7]  hearing was held. (Doc. 35, at 4). Karen Shimelfenig ("Shimelfenig"), not named as a Defendant in this action, testified to the computer usage policy pertaining to employees at Lackawanna County. (Doc. 35, at 4). However, Allen asserts the statement made by Shimelfenig was false. (Doc. 35, at 5). Allen alleges the statement made by Shimelfenig was false because Shimelfenig's statement was based on an allegedly false email authored by Lackawanna County, Browning, and Carmody two years prior to the hearing. (Doc. 35, at 5). The unemployment hearing officer relied on the email's allegedly false statement regarding Lackawanna County's computer usage policy to deny Allen's request for unemployment benefits. (Doc. 35, at 5).
Based on the allegations in the second amended complaint,4 which is the operative pleading in this case, Allen raises several causes of action under the ADA. Specifically, Allen asserts the following: a retaliatory discharge claim (Count One); an "ADA, Disability Harassment in Hostile Ambiance" claim, which the Court liberally construes as a hostile work environment claim (Count Four); and a failure to accommodate claim (Count Five). (Doc. 35, at 3, 6, 9). Allen also alleges [*8]  disparate treatment and retaliation claims under the FMLA (Count Three) and a state law fraud claim (Count Two). (Doc. 35, at 4-5). In her final cause of action, which appears to be an ADA Discrimination claim, Allen summarizes the allegations from the earlier parts of her complaint and cites to a string of statutes (Count Six).5 (Doc. 35, at 10-11). In support of the second amended complaint, Allen attaches various exhibits, including correspondence with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), correspondence with her Employer, medical records, and two job-position descriptions.6 (Doc. 35-1, at 1). As for relief, Allen seeks damages of approximately $40,000 in annual salary, compensatory and exemplary damages, and various other employment benefits resulting from her discharge. (Doc. 35, at 2; 4).
On February 14, 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12. (Doc. 36, at 1). Defendants submitted a brief in support on February 28, 2019 (Doc. 39), and Allen submitted a brief in opposition and a supporting exhibit on March 13, 2019. (Doc. 40); (Doc. 41). Defendants filed a reply brief on March 27, 2019. [*9]  (Doc. 44). The matter is fully briefed and ripe for review.

II. Discussion
A. Motion to Dismiss Standard
Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes a defendant to move to dismiss for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). "Under Rule 12(b)(6), a motion to dismiss may be granted only if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court finds the plaintiff's claims lack facial plausibility." Warren Gen. Hosp. v. Amgen Inc., 643 F.3d 77, 84 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). Although a court must accept the fact allegations in a complaint as true, it is not compelled to accept "unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences, or a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation." Morrow v. Balaski, 719 F.3d 160, 165 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Baraka v. McGreevey, 481 F.3d 187, 195 (3d Cir. 2007)). Additionally, a court need not assume that a plaintiff can prove facts that the plaintiff has not alleged. Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983).
In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009), the United States Supreme Court held that, when considering a motion to dismiss, a court should "begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right [*10]  to relief above the speculative level." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. In evaluating a motion to dismiss, a court may consider the facts alleged on the face of the complaint, as well as "documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice." Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007).
With the aforementioned standards in mind, a document filed pro se is "to be liberally construed." Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976). A pro se complaint, "however inartfully pleaded," must be held to "less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers" and can only be dismissed for failure to state a claim if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972).
B. Claims Brought Under the Ada7
In Counts One, Four, Five, and Six of the second amended complaint, Allen alleges that the Defendants violated her rights under the ADA. Pursuant to the ADA, employers are prohibited from discriminating "against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges [*11]  of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). A "qualified individual with a disability" is defined by the ADA as a person "with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). A "disability" is defined as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual; (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment."8 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).
The Court discusses each of Allen's ADA claims in turn.

Retaliatory Discharge Claim
In Count One of the second amended complaint, Allen brings a retaliatory discharge claim against her former employer, Lackawanna County. (Doc. 35, at 3-4). Allen alleges that, based on her Osteoarthritis, she submitted a reasonable accommodation request on November 3, 2016 in relation to her long-distance walking. (Doc. 35, at 3). Lackawanna County held an interactive process meeting9 on November 14, 2018, but allegedly participated in "bad faith" and did not address any reasonable accommodations for Allen. (Doc. 35, at 3). Lackawanna County then discharged Allen [*12]  on November 18, 2018, and denied her request for reasonable accommodations as moot. (Doc. 35, at 3).
Defendants move to dismiss Count One on the ground that Allen fails to establish a prima facie claim of retaliation. (Doc. 39, at 12-14, 21). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA,10 a plaintiff must show: (1) protected employee activity11; (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the employee's protected activity and the employer's adverse action. Krouse v. American Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 1997). If plaintiff can establish a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to defendant to "articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for its decision. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If defendant meets this minimal burden, plaintiff "must point to some evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which a factfinder could reasonably ... disbelieve [defendants'] articulated legitimate reasons."12 Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994).
Because Allen asserts "pretext" on the part of Lackawanna County for the retaliation and does not allege any direct evidence of retaliation, she must establish a prima-facie [*13]  case under the burden-shifting framework established by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Woodson v. Scott Paper Co., 109 F.3d 913, 920 n.2 (3d Cir. 1997). With respect to the first element of a prima facie retaliation claim, a good-faith request for an accommodation constitutes protected employee activict to the first element of a prima facie retaliation claim, a good-faith request for an accommodation constitutes protected employee activity under the ADA. Shellenberger, 318 F.3d at 191. Once ty under the ADA. Shellenberger, 318 F.3d at 191. Once the employee makes such a request, "the employer's duty to engage in the interactive process attaches." Castellani v. Bucks Cnty. Municipality, 351 F. App'x 774, 777 (3d Cir. 2009) (citing Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 312 (3d Cir. 1999)). As to the second element, employment termination qualifies as an adverse employment action. Aguiar v. Morgan Corp., 27 F. App'x 110, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). Regarding the third element, a causation analysis often, but not exclusively, rests on two key factors: "(1) the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the alleged retaliation13 and (2) the existence of any pattern of antagonism in the intervening period." Jensen v. Potter, 435 F.3d 444, 450 (3d Cir. 2006).
Here, Allen alleges that she requested a reasonable accommodation for her Osteoarthritis, which is a protected employee activity. See Shellenberger, 318 F.3d at 191; (Doc. 35, at 3). Defendants' duty to engage in the interactive process then attached under the ADA, and Lackawanna County held an interactive process meeting on November 14, 2016. See Castellani, 351 F. App'x at 777. Allen suffered an adverse employment action when Lackawanna County terminated her on November 18, 2016. See Aguiar, 27 F. App'x at 112. Thus, Allen has sufficiently [*14]  alleged the first two elements of a prima facie claim for retaliation.
In their motion to dismiss, however, Defendants challenge Allen's ability to meet the third, causation element. (Doc. 39, at 14). Specifically, Defendants point to instances in Allen's second amended complaint where she allegedly received pre-termination due process notices regarding her work performance. (Doc. 39, at 13). Defendants further argue that an employer need not delay an employee's termination merely because they learned that the employee had engaged in protected activity. (Doc. 39, at 14). Simply stated, Defendants assert that Allen cannot establish a causal connection between the protected employment activity and subsequent adverse employment action because Defendants planned to terminate her prior to her accommodation request.14 (Doc. 39, at 14).
In a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that the protected activity she engaged in was the determinative factor motivating Defendant to take the adverse employment action. See LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass'n, 503 F.3d 217, 232 n.8 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Caver v. City of Trenton, 420 F.3d 243, 267 (3d Cir. 2005); Watson v. SEPTA, 207 F.3d 207, 215 (3d Cir. 2000)); Diffenderfer v. Pa. State Emps. Credit Union, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47054, 2018 WL 1428164, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 22, 2018) (citing Gillette v. Donahoe, 622 F. App'x 178, 181 (3d Cir. 2015)). As discussed supra, to meet the causation element, a plaintiff "must prove either (1) an unusually suggestive temporal proximity between the protected [*15]  activity and the allegedly retaliatory action, or (2) a pattern of antagonism coupled with timing to establish a causal link." Moore v. Temple Univ., No. 13-5079, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99231, 2016 WL 4061352, at *6 (E.D. Pa. July 29, 2016), aff'd, 674 F. App'x 239 (3d Cir. 2017). Where the timing between a plaintiff's protected activity and the adverse action is not unusually suggestive, "[t]emporal proximity by itself is generally insufficient to establish a causal connection." Youssef v. Anvil Int'l, 595 F. Supp. 2d 547, 563 (E.D. Pa. 2009). Whether temporal proximity is sufficiently suggestive to establish causation, however, is dependent on the facts of each case, and an analysis of the probative value of circumstantial evidence in retaliation cases is necessarily very fact-bound and fact-specific. Romanaskas v. Earthbox, Inc., No. 3:16-CV-00517, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30451, 2018 WL 1370876, at *3-4 (M.D. Pa. Feb. 23, 2018), report and recommendation adopted, No. 3:16-CV-517, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43641, 2018 WL 1370612 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 16, 2018).
In the case at bar, Allen alleges merely four days passed between her Interactive Process meeting and her termination. (Doc. 35, at 3). A temporal proximity of four days can plausibly create an inference that a causal connection exists between Allen's request for accommodation and interactive process meeting and her termination. See Scopelliti v. Traditional Home Health and Hospice, No. 3:18-CV-00040 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66726, 2018 WL 1899294, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 20, 2018) (denying defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff's retaliation claim because temporal [*16]  proximity between protected activity and retaliatory action of four days supports an inference of causation). Further, in her brief in opposition, Allen contests the validity of some of the pre-termination due process notices she received. (Doc. 40, at 8-9). Thus, given the limited factual record before the Court at the motion to dismiss stage, and the Court's obligation to accept Allen's well pleaded allegations as true, the Court finds that dismissal on the issue of causation is improper at this juncture and that Allen's allegations sufficiently establish a prima facie claim of retaliation under the ADA. See McAssey v. Discovery Machine, Inc., No. 4:16-CV-705, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7624, 2017 WL 9532901, at *6 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 18, 2017) ("[T]he fact-based nature of causation questions often means that they are not readily amenable to resolution on a motion to dismiss, where our review is confined to an assessment of the well-pleaded facts.") (report and recommendation adopted 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113290, 2017 WL 3084676 (M.D. Pa. July 20, 2017)).
As such, the Court respectfully recommends that Defendants' motion to dismiss Allen's ADA retaliation claim be DENIED.

Hostile Work Environment Claim
When liberally construed, Count Four of the second amended complaint asserts a Hostile Work Environment claim against Lackawanna County, [*17]  Holmes, Loughney, and Browning. (Doc. 35, at 6-9). In support of dismissal, Defendants assert that none of the incidents of which Allen complains "included any remark, comment, or insult regarding her alleged disability." (Doc. 39, at 21). In response, Allen alleges that Defendants' "harassment involved repeat[ed], unwarranted, unjustifiable, disciplinary reprimands, as well as repeatedly scheduled ADA interactive process meetings for a reasonable accommodation to her anxiety with major depression disability. . ." (Doc. 40, at 13).
To establish a prima facie case for a hostile work environment claim under the ADA, an employee must show that:
(1) [she] is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA; (2) she was subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her disability or a request for an accommodation; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and to create an abusive working environment; and (5) [the employer] knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt effective remedial action.
Ballard-Carter v. Vanguard Grp., 703 F. App'x 149, 151-52 (3d Cir. 2017).
To be sufficiently severe or pervasive, the complained of harassment must "'alter the conditions [*18]  of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.'" Ballard-Carter, 703 F. App'x at 152 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). However, "it is important to bear in mind that: 'the Americans with Disabilities Act does not make all harassment, or every unpleasant working environment, actionable under the law. Rather, to constitute a hostile work environment under the ADA the harassing conduct must be because of the plaintiff's disability.'" Griffin v. Municipality of Kingston, No. 3:08-CV-2290, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17035, 2011 WL 718697, at *5 (M.D. Pa. Feb. 22, 2011) (emphasis in original) (quoting Walton v. Mental Health Ass'n of Se. Pa., 168 F.3d 661, 667 (3d Cir.1999)).
In the second amended complaint, Allen states that she is a qualified individual under the ADA based on her Anxiety Disorder and Osteoarthritis. (Doc. 35, at 6). Allen also complains of the following alleged acts of harassment:
(1) Pre-termination notices, based on fabricated charges, filed by Loughney on October 19, 2016 and November 1, 2016 (Doc. 35, at 7);
(2) Loughney's decision to schedule Loudermill Hearings while Allen was on medical disability leave, and then citing her for not attending said hearings (Doc. 35, at 7);
(3) Loughney repeatedly scheduling "unnecessary" ADA interactive process meetings for Allen's anxiety disorder with major depression, as he knew her doctor had filed written medical exemptions [*19]  with Lackawanna County regarding her performance of "distressful duties of emergent and protective services" and priority home visits (Doc. 35, at 7-8);
(4) Holmes threatening her with insubordination and termination on January 15, 2014 because she refused to sign her updated job description, which included performing priority home visits, and filed a related union grievance the day before (Doc. 35, at 8);
(5) Charging Allen for refusing to conduct three priority home visits on September 25, 2014 (Doc. 35, at 8);
(6) Holmes issuing Allen a three-day suspension without pay on March 11, 2015, while on disability leave (Doc. 35, at 8);
(7) Browning issuing infractions to Allen for deterioration in her work performance on September 20, 2015, based on her request for counseling sessions with her immediate work supervisor (Doc. 35, at 8); and
(8) Browning offering Allen an in-office job with a 5% salary reduction, based on fabricated charges. (Doc. 35, at 8).
In support of dismissal, Defendants highlight the isolated and sporadic nature of these alleged incidents, the fact that they occurred over a span of more than two years, and that none of these actions "included any remark, comment, or insult [*20]  regarding her alleged disability." (Doc. 39, at 20-21). As such, Defendants appear to challenge whether Allen's allegations meet the fourth element of a hostile work environment claim. See Ballard-Carter, 703 F. App'x at 151-52.
Upon evaluating the fourth element of a hostile work environment claim, a district court must "consider all the circumstances, including 'the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'" Lowenstein v. Catholic Health E., 820 F. Supp. 2d 639, 647 (E.D. Pa. 2011) (quoting Walton v. Mental Health Ass'n of Se. Pa., 168 F.3d 661, 667 (3d Cir. 1999). Here, when liberally construed, Allen alleges that her repeated discipline demonstrates15 a "pattern and practice" of harassment. (Doc. 40, at 13). She further avers that Defendants repeatedly issued these citations and infractions, despite knowing that she was either on disability leave, required disability leave, or was medically exempted from performing certain job requirements due to her disability. Cf. Lowenstein v. Catholic Health E., 820 F. Supp. 2d 639, 647 (E.D. Pa. 2011) (finding that the employer's repeated discipline, rejection of plaintiff's doctors notes, and continued refusal to cooperate with plaintiff regarding the absences she took in relation to her medical condition sufficiently stated [*21]  a hostile work environment claim). Mindful of its obligation to construe pro se pleadings liberally and take Allen's averments as true, the Court finds that, when considered together over the time period alleged, Defendants actions suggest sufficiently severe or pervasive discriminatory conduct for the purposes of stating a hostile work environment claim.
Thus, the Court respectfully recommends that Defendants motion to dismiss Allen's hostile work environment claim under the ADA be DENIED.

Failure to Accommodate Claim
In Count Five, Allen brings a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA. (Doc. 35, at 9-10). In moving to dismiss, Defendants argue that Allen's failure to accommodate claim is identical to her retaliation claim set forth in Count I, and thus fails as a matter of law. (Doc. 39, at 21). However, the Third Circuit has held that a failure to accommodate theory "cannot be characterized as a retaliation claim under the ADA." Pagonakis v. Express LLC, 315 F. App'x 425, 431 (3d Cir. 2009). Indeed, a failure to accommodate claim "is a direct discrimination claim based on alleged failures to fulfill the affirmative duties prescribed by the ADA, not a claim based on alleged actions prohibited by the ADA." Pagonakis, 315 F. App'x at 431 (citations omitted); [*22]  accord Solomon v. Sch. Dist. of Philadelphia, 882 F. Supp. 2d 766, 783-84 (E.D. Pa. 2012). Accordingly, the Court addresses failure to accommodate claim in Count Five apart from Allen's retaliation claim in Count One.
Under the ADA, discrimination encompasses an employer's failure to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity . . . . " Phillips v. Center for Vision Loss, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30186, 2017 WL 839465, at *11 (M.D. Pa. March 3, 2017) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). In order to establish a prima facie claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove: "(1) [s]he is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA;" (2) [s]he is otherwise qualified to perform the essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and (3) [s]he has suffered an otherwise adverse employment decision as a result of discrimination[,] "which in this context includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations for a plaintiff's disabilities." Hohider v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 574 F.3d 169, 186 (3d Cir. 2009) (internal quotations omitted). The employee must notify the employer that a reasonable accommodation is necessary in order to trigger the employer's [*23]  duty to accommodate. Schillaci v. Cargill Meat Solutions, No. 3:CV-12-561, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178548, 2012 WL 6589941, at *4 (M.D. Pa. December 18, 2012). The employee then must allege that the accommodation was denied. Schillaci, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178548, 2012 WL 6589941, at *4.
Regarding her physical disability, Allen alleges that she requested a reasonable accommodation of limited walking and that she and the employer met with the expectation of discussing the accommodation, but ultimately did not discuss it and her employer did not provide one. (Doc. 35, at 9-10). Allen further alleges that she was qualified to perform the essential job function, with or without reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 18 at 9 ¶ 2). Beyond arguing that Count Five is duplicative of Allen's ADA retaliation claim, Defendants do not contest Allen's allegations of disability, her request for a reasonable accommodation, or the failure to provide such an accommodation. Cf. Schillaci, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178548, 2012 WL 6589941, *4. As such, Allen has stated a prima facie case for failure to accommodate her Osteoarthritis with the reasonable accommodation of limited long-distance walking.
It is therefore recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss Allen's failure to accommodate claim be DENIED.

Disability Discrimination Claim
When liberally construed, Count Six of the second amended complaint appears to [*24]  bring a disability discrimination claim against Lackawanna County. (Doc. 35, at 10). Similar to a failure to accommodate claim, to state a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA a plaintiff must establish that: "(1) [s]he is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA; (2) [s]he is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and (3) [s]he has suffered an otherwise adverse employment decision as a result of discrimination." Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 306 (3d Cir. 1999) (quoting Gaul v. Lucent Technologies, 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir. 1998)). "To state a cognizable disability discrimination claim, [the plaintiff] must allege that [his] termination ... was a pretext or otherwise an instance of discrimination on the basis of disability." Zankel v. Temple Univ., 245 F. App'x 196, 199 (3d Cir. 2007). If the employee makes out a prima facie case of discrimination, the employer may prevail by demonstrating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action. Barclay v. Amtrak, 240 F. App'x 505, 507 (3d Cir. 2007).
Here, Allen generally alleges that Lackawanna County's reasons for terminating her were "illogical, irrational, incredible, unjust, and factually . . . pretext for prohibited employment discrimination and retaliation . . ." (Doc. 35, at 10). She then cites to the respective reasons Lackawanna County [*25]  provided for terminating her, claiming as follows: that any willful misconduct related to her access of the employer's network, in violation of their policies, is "absurd"; that her insubordination for not following the employer's network access policy was discriminatory, because Browning only sent the policy to her and thus did not "uniformly appl[y] [the directive] to all employees"; that the falsification of documentation charge is based on Lackawanna County's misinterpretation of a certain journal entry; and that her criminal misuse of county property "is not plausible as a criminal misdemeanor, let alone as [] employee misuse." (Doc. 35, at 10-11). Even when taken as true, however, Allen's conclusory allegations fail to state a plausible ADA discrimination claim. Simply stated, Allen does not sufficiently plead that her termination was motivated by the Lackawanna County's discriminatory animus towards her alleged disability.
In addition to her ADA discrimination claim, Allen cites to the following statutes in Count Six of the second amended complaint, without providing any supporting factual allegations: "42 U.S.C. 1983; 42 U.S.C. 1981(a); 42 U.S.C. 12101-12213 and 12203; 43 PS 951-963; 29 U.S.C. 2601, et seq.; 29 U.S.C. 623(d); 28 C.F.R. 28, 35, 130-140; 28 C.F.R. 42.510-42.512; 29 CFR Labor 1630.1-1630.9; [and] Title [*26]  42, Pa Tort Claims Act, 8545 . . . "16 (collectively, the "Miscellaneous Statutory Claims"). (Doc. 35, at 11). As argued by the Defendants in moving to dismiss, Allen's bare invocation of these statutes without further legal argument or rationale is insufficient to state a cause of action. (Doc. 39, at 26-33); (Doc. 44, at 11-12); See Lenhart v. Pennsylvania, 528 F. App'x 111, 114 (3d Cir. 2013) (citations omitted); see also Shaud v. Sugarloaf Twp. Supervisors, No. 3:07cv1212, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25229, 2011 WL 882438, at *3 n. 3 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 11, 2011) (granting motion to dismiss where numerous counts of complaint make no allegations about defendants). Moreover, Allen's brief in opposition provides no factual allegations that would enhance, or otherwise clarify, her miscellaneous statutory claims. (Doc. 40, at 16).
As such, the Court recommends that Defendants' motion to dismiss be GRANTED as to the Miscellaneous Statutory Claims set forth in Count Six of the second amended complaint, and that Allen's ADA Discrimination claim be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim.
C. FMLA Retaliation Claim17
In Count Three of the second amended complaint, Allen brings a Retaliation claim against Lackawanna County and Browning under the FMLA. (Doc. 35, at 5-6). The primary purposes of the FMLA are to balance the demands of the [*27]  workplace with the needs of families and to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons. The FMLA endeavors to accomplish these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers. Callison v. City of Philadelphia, 430 F.3d 117, 119 (3d Cir. 2005). The FMLA "entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave annually for any of several reasons, including the onset of a 'serious health condition' in an employee's spouse, child, or parent." DeCicco v. Mid-Atl. Healthcare, LLC, 275 F. Supp. 3d 546, 560 (E.D. Pa. 2017) (quoting Nevada Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 724, 123 S. Ct. 1972, 155 L. Ed. 2d 953 (2003) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C))). An employer is prohibited from taking action "to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under" the FMLA (an "interference" claim), and may not "discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful" by the FMLA (a "retaliation" or "discrimination" claim). Callison, 430 F.3d at 119.
In the amended complaint, Allen asserts that she returned from taking her approved FMLA leave on May 5, 2015. (Doc. 35, at 5). However, pursuant to Lackawanna County's "Return from Medical Leave with No Restrictions" policy, Allen was functionally demoted from her position on July 28, 2016 and replaced by a younger, non-disabled, less-experienced employee. (Doc. [*28]  35, at 5). Allen further alleges that Browning restored another employee to her former job upon returning from medical leave. (Doc. 35, at 5). Accordingly, Allen asserts that Browning denied her the protection of her former position and retaliated against her for using her approved leave under the FMLA. (Doc. 35, at 6).
In support of dismissal, Defendants argue that Allen's retaliation claim fails because a functional demotion does not constitute an adverse employment action under the FMLA. (Doc. 39, at 17). The FMLA prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee because the employee exercised her rights under the FMLA or "oppos[ed] any practice made unlawful by" it. Reifer v. Colonial Intermediate Unit 20, 462 F.Supp.2d 621, 638 (M.D. Pa. 2006) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c)). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of the FMLA, the plaintiff must show that 1) she engaged in an activity protected under the statute, 2) she suffered an adverse employment decision; and 3) the adverse decision was causally related to the exercise of her FMLA rights. Reifer v. Colonial Intermediate Unit 20, 462 F. Supp. 2d 621, 639 (M.D. Pa. 2006) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c)).
Medical leave is an activity protected by the FMLA. Lichtenstein v. Univ. of Pitt. Med. Ctr., 691 F.3d 294, 307 (3d Cir. 2012). "The Supreme Court has defined an adverse employment action as a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to [*29]  promote, reassignment, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.'" Clark v. Phila. Hous. Auth., 701 F. App'x 113, 117 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Burlington Indus. Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 749, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998)). An adverse employment action is one "serious and tangible enough to alter an employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Langley v. Merck & Co., 186 F. App'x 258, 260 (3d Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted). On the other hand, "[m]inor actions, such as lateral transfers and changes of title and reporting relationships, are generally insufficient to constitute adverse employment actions." Langley, 186 F. App'x at 260 (internal citations omitted).
Allen asserts that she engaged in the protected activity of taking FMLA medical leave, from which she returned on May 5, 2015. (Doc. 35, at 5). Browning then functionally demoted her from her "Civil Service responsibilities," despite allowing another employee to retain her same position upon similarly returning from medical leave. (Doc. 35, at 5). However, beyond Allen's vague allegation that Browning "adversely removed all of her state job responsibilities," she does not discuss what specific duties were eliminated, or whether an elimination of these responsibilities seriously affected the terms, conditions, or privileges of her employment. Thus, Allen does not sufficiently allege a tangible, adverse employment [*30]  action that resulted from her alleged functional demotion.18 See Langley, 186 F. App'x at 260; cf. Jakomas v. City of Pitt., 342 F. Supp. 3d 632, 645 (W.D. Pa. 2018) (finding employee suffered adverse employment action when employer assigned her menial tasks that were outside of her job description, such as organizing and cleaning offices, and lost many "residual supervisory responsibilities and authorities"). As such, it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss Allen's FMLA retaliation claim be GRANTED.
D. Procedural Due Process Claims
Although not asserted as an individual count in the second amended complaint, Allen frequently alleges violations of her right to procedural Due Process and cites to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. (Doc. 35, at 3; 5; 7-8; 10-11). Specifically, Allen asserts Due Process violations with respect to the following alleged actions taken by her Employer, Lackawanna County: (1) her three-day suspension without pay, commencing March 11, 2015; (2) her functional demotion on July 18, 2016; (3) her receipt of an infraction on October 2, 2016; and (4) ultimately, the termination of her employment with Lackawanna County on November 18, 2016. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that a state may not "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process [*31]  of law, ..." U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. In deference to Allen's pro se status, the Court liberally construes her allegations as asserting procedural due process claims under the Fourteenth Amendment against the Defendants pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.19

Allen's March 11, 2015 Suspension Without Pay
Insofar as Allen seeks to bring a claim in relation to her unpaid suspension on March 11, 2015, Defendants argue that it is time barred. (Doc. 39, at 22). "The statute of limitations for a § 1983 claim arising in Pennsylvania is two years." Montanez v. Sec'y Pa. Dep't of Corr., 773 F.3d 472, 480 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Kach v. Hose, 589 F.3d 626, 634 (3d Cir. 2009)); see also West v. Williamsport Area Cmty. Coll., 492 F. Supp. 90, 97-98 (M.D. Pa. 1980) (two-year limitations period applies to procedural due process claims). A § 1983 claim accrues when the plaintiff knows, or should know, of the injury which gives rise to her complaint. Montanez, 773 F.3d at 480. A procedural due process claim accrues when the actor takes the threatened final action. See Arezzo v. City of Hoboken, 719 F. App'x 115, 117-18 (3d Cir. 2018) (finding procedural due process claim accrued, at latest, when commission issued final administrative decision implementing employee's suspension).
Here, the action of which Allen complains occurred on March 11, 2015, when Holmes issued a three-day suspension without pay, without warning, and without "due process notice and [a] hearing." Therefore, Allen's procedural due process claim regarding this action accrued, at latest, when [*32]  the suspension began on March 11, 2015. See Arezzo, 719 F. App'x at 118. Allen thus needed to file suit regarding this alleged deprivation of procedural due process within two years of its accrual, or by March 11, 2017. See Montanez, 773 F.3d at 480; West, 492 F. Supp. at 97-98. However, Allen initially filed suit in this matter on January 30, 2018, well outside the two-year statute of limitations. (Doc. 1). Nonetheless, Allen argues in her brief in opposition that either the continuing violations doctrine or equitable tolling should extend the statute of limitations in this case. (Doc. 40, at 15). Defendants assert that neither doctrines are applicable in this case. (Doc. 44, at 7-10).
First, Allen asserts that her psychological needs, including suicidal ideation, warrant equitable tolling of the statute of limitations in this case. (Doc. 40, at 15). To benefit from the doctrine of equitable tolling, plaintiff must show three elements: (1) that the defendant actively misled the plaintiff; (2) that the defendant's acts prevented the plaintiff from recognizing the validity of her claim within the limitations period; and (3) that the plaintiff's ignorance cannot be attributable to her lack of reasonable due diligence in uncovering the facts relevant to the claim. [*33]  Cetel v. Kirwan Fin. Grp., Inc., 460 F.3d 494, 509 (3d Cir. 2006). Here, Allen to cites her own psychological difficulties in support of her equitable tolling argument. (Doc. 40, at 12). However, Allen does not allege that the Defendants actively engaged in any activity that misled her, or otherwise prevented her from timely bringing her claims. See Cetel, 460 F.3d at 509. Therefore, the equitable tolling doctrine does not apply here.
Second, Allen asserts that an employer's continuing violations, such as fraudulent reprimands, misrepresentations, and concealment, can extend the statute of limitations. (Doc. 40, at 12). To invoke the continuing violations doctrine, a plaintiff must point to "continual unlawful acts" on the part of defendants, "not continual ill effects from an original violation.'" Mumma v. High-Spec, Inc., 400 F. App'x 629, 632 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Weis—Buy Servs., Inc. v. Paglia, 411 F.3d 415, 423 (3d Cir. 2005)). Further, "the continuing violations doctrine is not a substitute for a plaintiff's 'awareness of and duty to assert his/her rights' in a timely fashion." Bennett v. Susquehanna Cty. Children & Youth Servs., 592 F. App'x 81, 85 (3d Cir. 2014). Here, Allen neither explains how any fraud allegedly committed by the Defendants constituted a continuing violation of her due process rights nor alleges that she was unaware of the suspension, and the injury arising therefrom, when it occurred. Thus, the continuing violations doctrine does not apply to [*34]  Allen's procedural due process claim regarding her March 2015 suspension without pay. See Montanez, 773 F.3d at 481 (quoting Paglia, 411 F.3d at 423).
Therefore, the Court recommends that Defendants' motion to dismiss Allen's due process claim regarding her March 2015 suspension without pay be GRANTED, as it is time-barred.

July 22, 2016 Written Warning
Allen also argues that she received insufficient process with respect to a written warning issued to her by Browning on July 22, 2016. (Doc. 35, at 5-6). Defendants argue this written warning did not violate her due process rights because a written warning is insufficient to trigger the Fourteenth Amendment's due process protections. (Doc. 36, at 23-24). Defendants rely on Bianchi v. Rutgers, the State Univ. of N.J., Civil Action No. 14-131, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12538, 2016 WL 430597, at *6 (D. N. J. Feb. 3, 2016) for the proposition that a written warning is insufficient to trigger Allen's due process protections because the written warning does not "directly and immediately" deprive plaintiff of any property or liberty interest. (Doc. 36, at 23-24). Thus, defendants do not specifically dispute whether Allen had a protectable interest, either liberty or property, in her employment — instead, they dispute whether the July 22, 2016 written warning deprived her of a protected interest. Neither Allen's complaint nor her brief in opposition to Defendants' [*35]  motion to dismiss specify which of her interests was deprived without adequate due process protections.
However, in the employment context, the due process interests most likely to be implicated by an adverse employer action include a property interest or a liberty interest. See Hill v. Borough of Kutztown, 455 F.3d 225, 233-34 (3d Cir. 2006). Courts use a 'two-stage analysis' to analyze a state actor's alleged failure to provide due process. Alvin v. Suzuki, 227 F.3d 107, 116 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting Robb v. City of Phila., 733 F.2d 286, 292 (3d Cir.1984)). The Court first considers whether the plaintiff's asserted interests are within the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of life, liberty, or property. Alvin, 227 F.3d at 116 (citing Robb, 733 F.2d at 292). Second, the Court considers "whether the procedures available provided the plaintiff with 'due process of law.'" Alvin, 227 F.3d at 116 (quoting Robb, 733 F.2d at 292). Although Allen does not specify which interest she intends to protect with regard to her July 22, 2016 written warning, the most natural reading of her complaint suggests she intends to protect her property interest, because the complaint arises from the termination of her employment.20
Plaintiff must demonstrate a "legitimate claim of entitlement" to a property interest for that property interest to enjoy the Fourteenth Amendment's due process protections. See Fanti v. Weinstock, No. 3:11-CV-01077, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155322, 2014 WL 5586348, at *6 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 3, 2014) (quoting Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972)). "Legitimate entitlement to a job requires 'more than [*36]  a unilateral expectation of continued employment.'" Duran v. Cnty. of Clinton, No. 4:14-CV-2047, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128801, 2015 WL 5675580, at *8 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 25, 2015) (quoting Elmore v. Cleary, 399 F.3d 279, 282 (3d Cir. 2005)). An at-will employee has no legitimate entitlement to continued employment, because her employment is at the pleasure of her employer. See Elmore, 399 F.3d at 282 (citing Chabal v. Reagan, 841 F.2d 1216, 1223 (3d Cir. 1988)). Therefore, a terminated employee must allege she had more than a unilateral expectation of continued employment in order to trigger procedural due process protections. See Duran, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128801, 2015 WL 5675580, at *7. "'Whether a person has a legitimate entitlement to—and hence a property interest in—his government job is a question answered by state law.'"21 Hill, 455 F.3d at 234 (citing Elmore, 399 F.3d at 282).22
Even assuming Allen had a property interest in her continued employment under Pennsylvania law, a deprivation for purposes of procedural due process does not occur until she is discharged, either actually or constructively, or receives an unjust disciplinary suspension. See Mims v. City of Phila., Civil Action No. 09-4288, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50642, 2010 WL 2077140, at *6 (E.D. Pa. May 19, 2010) (citing Dee, 549 F.3d at 230 n. 6); Rusnak v. Williams, 44 F. App'x 555, 558 (3d Cir. 2002)). Specifically, a reduction in salary or benefits must accompany an employment demotion before it implicates the procedural due process clause. See Donovan v. Pittston Area Sch. Dist., 218 F. Supp. 3d 304, 312-13 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 31, 2016) (granting summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff-employee's procedural due process claim regarding a demotion which [*37]  "may be less desirable and may entail fewer responsibilities that her previous position" but includes the same benefits and pay). A termination, constructive discharge, or suspension must occur before a property interest attaches to an employment decision, because if federal courts were to consider that "a mere change in work assignment deprived an employee of a property interest, as a practical matter we would be federalizing routine employment decisions.'" Donovan, 218 F. Supp. 3d at 312 (quoting Ferraro v. City of Long Branch, 23 F.3d 803, 806 (3d Cir. 1994)).
Here, Allen alleges three pre-termination notices preceded her July 22, 2016 written warning. (Doc. 35, at 5-6). However, Allen does not allege her receipt of the written warning deprived of any protected property interests. See Alvin, 227 F.3d at 116 (citing Robb, 733 F.2d at 292); Mims, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50642, 2010 WL 2077140, at *6. Although the written warning may have been a step along the path in the direction of Allen's ultimate termination, a procedural due process claim does not accrue until the deprivation occurs. See Arezzo v. City of Hoboken, 719 F. App'x 115, 117-18 (3d Cir. 2018). As such, Allen's invocation of due process with respect to her receipt of a written warning does not allege a deprivation of a property interest sufficient to trigger procedural due process protections.
Therefore, the Court recommends GRANTING Defendants' motion to dismiss with respect [*38]  to Allen's procedural due process claim based on the written warning she received on July 22, 2016.

Allen's July 18, 2016 Functional Demotion
Additionally, Allen appears to raise a procedural due process challenge with respect to her July 18, 2016, functional demotion. (Doc. 35, at 5). As discussed supra, this functional demotion allegedly consisted of Lackawanna County removing certain Civil Service responsibilities from her job duties. (Doc. 35, at 5). However, Allen does not allege she lost benefits or pay because of this functional demotion. Further, this functional demotion was not a suspension or termination from her job. Therefore, Allen does not allege this functional demotion resulted in a deprivation of property cognizable protected by Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process. See Donovan v. Pittston Area Sch. Dist., 218 F. Supp. 3d 304, 312-13 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 31, 2016).
As such, to the extent Allen raises a procedural due process claim regarding her July 18, 2016 functional demotion, the Court respectfully recommends that it be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim.23

Allen's November 21, 2016 Termination of Employment
When liberally construed, the second amended complaint also asserts that Lackawanna County violated Allen's due process rights by terminating her "without [*39]  any prior warning on cited charges for a just cause dismissal, and without . . . notice and [a] hearing." (Doc. 35, at 10). At this procedural stage, Defendants do not challenge whether Allen possessed a property interest in her continued employment with Lackawanna County that was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. (Doc. 39, at 15 n. 5). However, Defendants assert that Allen's procedural due process claim fails because she was afforded constitutionally adequate process leading up to her November 21, 2016 termination. (Doc. 39, at 24). Specifically, Defendants claim that Allen was terminated following the receipt and review of her two written responses—dated October 25, 2016 and November 9, 2016—to the pre-deprivation notices Lackawanna County issued on October 19, 2016 and November 1, 2016. (Doc. 39, at 25).
"Federal law determines what process is due." Kohn v. Sch. Dist. of City of Harrisburg, 817 F. Supp. 2d 487, 505 (M.D. Pa. 2011) (citing McDaniels v. Flick, 59 F.3d 446, 458 (3d Cir. 1995)). "Generally, federal due process requires a pre-deprivation hearing before a person is deprived of a property right." Kohn, 817 F. Supp. 2d at 507 (citing Schmidt v. Creedon, 639 F.3d 587, 595-96 (3d Cir. 2011)). "This means that an employee who possesses a constitutionally protected property interest in employment must be given at least some way to respond to the charges against her prior to discharge." Judge v. Shikellamy Sch. Dist., 135 F. Supp. 3d 284, 294 (M.D. Pa. 2015) (citing Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985)); see also [*40]  Cipriani v. Lycoming Cnty. Hous. Auth., 177 F. Supp. 2d 303, 319 (M.D. Pa. 2001) (citing Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 545-46) ("If the employee is to lose his or her employment, that process includes an informal, pre-termination hearing."). The pre-termination hearing "'need only include oral or written notice of the charges, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity for the employee to tell his side of the story.'" Cipriani, 177 F. Supp. 2d at 319 (citing Gilbert v. Homar, 520 U.S. 924, 929, 117 S. Ct. 1807, 138 L. Ed. 2d 120 (1997)).
Here, Allen states that Loughney sent her pre-termination notices "of fabricated charges" on October 19th and November 1st, 2016. (Doc. 35, at 7). Allen's characterization of these charges as "fabricated" suggests an awareness of—albeit a disagreement with—the evidence levied against her by Lackawanna County. Even when construed in the light most favorable to Allen, the Defendants thus satisfied the notice and explanation of the employer's evidence requirements for a pre-termination hearing to comport with her procedural due process rights. See Cipriani, 177 F. Supp. 2d at 319. However, this does not necessarily establish that Allen also "had some way to respond to the charges against her prior to discharge." Judge, 135 F. Supp. 3d at 294 (citing Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542).
Defendants cite to Allen's second amended complaint at pages 6(g) and 7(f) in support of their argument that Allen was afforded the opportunity to respond to Lackawanna [*41]  County's grounds for termination. Specifically, Defendants suggest that the cited portions of Allen's second amended complaint reveal that Defendants received and reviewed her written responses to the October 19th and November 1st pre-termination notices on October 15, 2016, and November 9, 2016, respectively. (Doc. 39, at 18). Plaintiff's complaint at 6(g) refers to charges she filed with the Department of Labor. (Doc. 35, at 6). Plaintiff's complaint at 7(f) refers to her receipt of the October 19th and November 1st 2016 Pre-Termination Notices. (Doc. 35, at 7). Allen further argues, however, that she was unable to be heard when Lackawanna County issued its October 19, 2016 and November 1, 2016 notices because she was unable to attend the hearings. (Doc. 35, at 7); (Doc. 40, at 14).
When liberally construed, Allen alleges that she was not afforded the opportunity to rebut any of the evidence Lackawanna County relied upon in their October 19, 2016 and November 1, 2016 pre-termination notices. As such, she asserts that she had no opportunity to tell her side of the story as to the nature of the charges brought against her. See Cipriani, 177 F. Supp. 2d at 319. Cognizant of the Court's obligation to take Allen's allegations [*42]  as true, and the lack of a fully developed record at this stage of the proceedings, the Court finds that she has plausibly stated a claim for denial of due process with respect to the October 19, 2016 and November 1, 2016 Pre-Termination Notices. Cf. St. Clair v. Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr., No. CIV.A. 3:13-06, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22857, 2014 WL 695582, at *6 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 24, 2014) (finding that plaintiff's due process claim did not survive dismissal based on the pre-termination notice she received, the pre-termination hearing that was held, and the plaintiff's participation in a post-termination grievance hearing). As such, the Court recommends that Defendant's motion to dismiss Allen's Fourteenth Amendment claim, with respect to the alleged insufficient pre-termination process leading up to her November 21, 2016 termination, be DENIED.
E. State Law Claims

Fraud Claim
In count two of the operative complaint, Allen asserts a fraud claim against Defendants. More narrowly, she asserts that Lackawanna County, Browning, and Carmody "knew that the 1.02.15 email statement was false, yet had submitted it, and never disclosed the true, one and only, [Lackawanna County] policy on computer usage." (Doc. 35, at 4). Allen also alleges Scmimelfenig played a role in this fraud, by sending [*43]  a false email on January 2, 2015.24 (Doc. 35, at 4). Defendants assert Allen's fraud claim should be dismissed because she fails to specify the content of the falsity in the email or the SAMS policy. (Doc. 39, at 16). In her brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss, Allen asserts the January 2, 2015, email was false because it referred to a policy which did not exist. (Doc. 40, at 10).
To assert a claim of fraud plaintiff must allege: "(1) representation; (2) which is material to the transaction at hand; (3) made falsely, with the knowledge of its falsity or recklessness as to whether it is true or false; (4) with the intent of misleading another into relying on it; (5) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation; and (6) the resulting injury was proximately caused by the reliance." Foster v. JLG Industries, 372 F. Supp. 2d 792, 800 (M.D. Pa. 2005) (quoting Feeney v. Disston Manor Personal Care Home, Inc., 2004 PA Super 114, 849 A.2d 590, 597 (Pa. Super. 2004)). Further, "pursuant to Rule 9(b), a plaintiff averring a claim in fraud must specify 'the who, what, when, where, and how: the first paragraph of any newspaper story.'" Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig., 180 F.3d 525, 534 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting DiLeo v. Ernst & Young, 901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir.1990)). "Although Rule 9(b) falls short of requiring every material detail of the fraud such as date, location, and time, plaintiffs must use alternative means of injecting precision and some measure of substantiation into their allegations [*44]  of fraud." In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props. Secs. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir.2002) (internal citations omitted).
Allen alleges the January 2, 2015, email was a false representation of "an existing AAA policy on the 'Accessing' of SAMS" only from a AAA computer. (Doc. 35, at 4). However, Allen does not state a fraud claim against Browning and Carmody because Allen does not allege Browning and Carmody acted with an intent to defraud anyone. Under the Scienter heading of her complaint, Allen merely alleges Browning and Carmody knew it to be false and did not take any affirmative steps to correct its falsity. (Doc. 35, at 4). See Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, 238 F. Supp. 3d 638, 646 (M.D. Pa. 2017) (granting motion to dismiss fraud claim where only "cursory assertion" supported claim that defendants acted with requisite intent). As such, Allen's allegations of fraud do not contain the specificity required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) with respect to the intent prong of her fraud claim. See Foster, 372 F. Supp. 2d at 800 (quoting Feeney, 849 A.2d at 597).
Therefore, the Court recommends that Defendants' motion to dismiss Allen's fraud claims be GRANTED.

Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress ("IIED")
As a final matter, in connection with Count Four, Allen refers to the "Tort of Intentional Infliction of Severe, Emotional Distress" in relation to the adverse mental health effects she allegedly suffered [*45]  since her termination. (Doc. 35, at 9). Defendants assert Allen has not pled sufficient facts to state an IIED claim. (Doc. 39, at 12 n.4). Specifically, Defendants argue that Allen's "passing reference" to an IIED claim does not establish extreme and outrageous conduct as a matter of law. (Doc. 39, at 12 n. 4). Notably, Allen's brief in opposition to this motion to dismiss does not clarify her IIED claim. (Doc. 40).
At its most basic, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress requires a plaintiff establish: (1) that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous; (2) that the conduct was intentional or reckless; (3) the conduct caused emotional distress; and (4) the distress was severe. See Chuy v. Phila. Eagles Football Club, 595 F.2d 1265, 1273 (3d Cir. 1979). "The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress requires a showing that the defendants acted in a manner so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized society." McGreevy v. Stroup, 413 F.3d 359, 371 (3d Cir. 2005) (internal citations omitted). Further, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED") requires physical injury, harm, or illness caused by the defendant's conduct. [*46]  Dempsey v. Bucknell Univ., 76 F. Supp. 3d 565, 589 (M.D. Pa. 2015).
The Court's role at the motion to dismiss stage is something of a gate-keeper, ensuring that the facts of the complaint afford relief. Moyer v. Lebanon Cty., No. 3:16-CV-01424, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 213261, 2017 WL 6989168, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Dec. 28, 2017) (report and recommendation adopted 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8126, 2018 WL 472444 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 18, 2018)). However, because the acts alleged must involve the "most egregious conduct . . . it is extremely rare to find conduct in the employment context that will rise to the level of outrageousness necessary to provide a basis for recovery for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress." Hoy v. Angelone, 554 Pa. 134, 720 A.2d 745, 754 (Pa. 1998) (quoting Cox v. Keystone Carbon, 861 F.2d 390, 395 (3d Cir. 1988)); see Palma v. Volunteers of Am., No. 04-919, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5176, 2006 WL 328352, at *8 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 9, 2006) ("Application of the doctrine is 'most limited' and 'extremely rare' in the employment context."). Indeed, intentional infliction of emotional distress claims in employment cases have been limited to instances where "'an employer engaged in both sexual harassment and other retaliatory behavior against an employee.'" Bartos v. MHM Servs., Inc., No. 3:CV-09-1018, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141077, 2009 WL 10677835, at *2 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 14, 2009); quoting Wilkins v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., No. 03-6610, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20305, 2005 WL 2271866, at *9 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 15, 2005) (quoting Hoy, 720 A.2d at 754).
Here, Allen does not raise any IIED claim as a standalone cause of action. Nor does she set out separate allegations with respect to an IIED claim. Rather, Allen simply states:
Plaintiff, with the misconduct knowledge of [Employer], et al., has endured pervasive and grievous, psychological duress/harm [*47]  to the point of necessitated, professional mental-health counseling for suicidal ideation from November 19th 2016, to 2018. (Tort Intentional Infliction of Severe, Emotional Distress).
(Doc. 35, at 9).
Even when liberally construed and taken as true, as a matter of law, none of Defendants' conduct rises to a level of extremity or outrage as would afford Allen relief. See Moyer, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 213261, 2017 WL 6989168, at *4. Accordingly, and in consideration of the limited and extremely rare application of this tort in the employment context, it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss be GRANTED insofar as Allen intends to bring a state law IIED claim.

III. Leave to Amend
The Third Circuit has acknowledged that a district court has "substantial leeway in deciding whether to grant leave to amend." Lake v. Arnold, 232 F.3d 360, 373 (3d Cir.2000). "Denial of leave to amend a complaint is especially appropriate where a party has already been given the opportunity to amend the complaint." In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Practices & Products Liab. Litig., 564 F. App'x 672, 673 (3d Cir. 2014) (not precedential) (citing Lake, 232 F.3d at 373) ("[W]e are inclined to give the District Court even broader discretion when, as here, the court has already granted the requesting party an opportunity to amend its complaint.")).
Here, after granting Defendants' second motion to dismiss, the Court granted Allen an [*48]  opportunity to file a second amended complaint, correcting the deficiencies outlined in the Court's Report and Recommendation. (Doc. 29). Despite the Court's alerting Allen to the deficiencies in her pleadings and granting her leave to amend, she failed to cure some of the pleading's deficiencies which the Court had identified. Further, Allen included additional allegations that failed to comport with the Court's directive that "[a]ll claims should be set out in individual, numbered counts." (Doc. 29). As such, the Court does not recommend granting Allen leave to file a third amended complaint, as permitting her to take another "bite at the apple" would be futile. Moreover, the existing "record in this matter is muddled" which weighs in favor of denying further leave to amend. See In re Avandia Mktg., 564 F. App'x at 673.

IV. Recommendation
Based on the foregoing, the Court recommends the motion to dismiss be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Specifically, it is recommended that:
1. Defendants' third motion to dismiss (Doc. 36) be GRANTED, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as to the following claims:
