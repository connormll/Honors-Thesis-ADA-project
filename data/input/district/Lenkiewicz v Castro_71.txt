MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
This employment discrimination action against the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") presents a failure to accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 791 et seq. See Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 18]. Plaintiff, by counsel, moves pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) to [*2]  exclude the report and trial testimony of Defendant's Expert, R. Marshall Ackerman, M.D. [Dkt. # 38]. Plaintiff contends that the report is untimely and "fails to comply with the most rudimentary requirements of [Fed. R. Civ. P.] 26(a)." Id. at 1. In response, defendant has proffered the "Rebuttal Expert Report of Dr. Ackerman," thereby conceding, implicitly if not explicitly, plaintiff's arguments for excluding the document as an opening expert report. See Def.'s Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. to Exclude the Report and Trial Testimony of R. Marshall Ackerman, M.D., Ex. 1 [Dkt. # 45-1].
For the following reasons, the Court finds that the proffered report fails to rebut plaintiff's expert reports and is merely cumulative of information about which defendant's designated expert witness, Dr. James Allen, might testify. See Oct. 31, 2014 Order at 1 [Dkt. # 41] (noting defendant's disclosure of Dr. Allen "as his only expert witness"). Hence, plaintiff's motion to exclude Dr. Ackerman's report will be granted.

I. LEGAL STANDARD
While neither the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure nor the Federal Rules of Evidence expressly provide for motions in limine, the Court may allow such motions "pursuant to the district court's inherent authority [*3]  to manage the course of trials." Barnes v. District of Columbia, 924 F. Supp. 2d 74, 78 (D.D.C. 2013) (quoting Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 41 n.4, 105 S. Ct. 460, 83 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1984)). Motions in limine are "'designed to narrow the evidentiary issues for trial and to eliminate unnecessary trial interruptions.'" Graves v. District of Columbia, 850 F. Supp. 2d 6, 10 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 913 F.2d 1064, 1070 (3d Cir. 1990)). As thoroughly explained in Graves:
Broadly speaking, the Federal Rules of Evidence permit the admission of "relevant evidence"—that is, evidence that "has any tendency to make a fact [of consequence] more or less probable than it would be without the evidence," Fed. R. Evid. 401—provided it is not otherwise excluded by the Rules, the Constitution of the United States, or an Act of Congress, Fed. R. Evid. 402, and its probative value is not "substantially outweighed by a danger of . . . unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence," Fed. R. Evid. 403.
In light of their limited purpose, motions in limine "should not be used to resolve factual disputes," which remains the "function of a motion for summary judgment, with its accompanying and crucial procedural safeguards." C & E Servs., Inc. v. Ashland Inc., 539 F. Supp. 2d 316, 323 (D.D.C. 2008) . . . . In other words, "[f]actual questions should not be resolved through motions in limine," Goldman v. Healthcare Mgmt. Sys., Inc., 559 F. Supp. 2d 853, 871 (W.D.Mich. 2008) (citation omitted), nor is a motion in limine a "vehicle for a party to ask the Court to weigh the sufficiency [*4]  of the evidence," Bowers v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 563 F. Supp. 2d 508, 532 (D.N.J. 2008). Rather, parties should target their arguments to demonstrating why certain items or categories of evidence should (or should not) be introduced at trial, and direct the trial judge to specific evidence in the record that would favor or disfavor the introduction of those particular items or categories of evidence. U.S. ex rel. El—Amin v. George Washington Univ., 533 F. Supp. 2d 12, 19 (D.D.C. 2008). In short, motions in limine are a means for arguing why "evidence should or should not, for evidentiary reasons, be introduced at trial." Williams v. Johnson, 747 F. Supp. 2d 10, 18 (D.D.C. 2010) (emphasis in original).
Barnes, 924 F. Supp. 2d at 78 (quoting Graves at 10-11).
"In evaluating the admissibility of proffered evidence on a pretrial motion in limine the court must assess whether the evidence is relevant and, if so, whether it is admissible, pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 401 and 402." Flythe v. District of Columbia, 4 F. Supp. 3d 222, 226 (D.D.C. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The trial judge's discretion extends not only to the substantive evidentiary ruling, but also to the threshold question of whether a motion in limine presents an evidentiary issue that is appropriate for ruling in advance of trial. Barnes, 924 F. Supp. 2d at 78 (quoting Graves at 11).
Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides for the admission of expert testimony
[i]f (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or [*5]  to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
Fed. R. Evid. 702. "The burden is on the proponent of testimony to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered expert witness is qualified, that his proposed testimony would be useful to the finder of fact, and that the testimony is reliable." Sykes v. Napolitano, 634 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2009) (citations omitted).

II. ANALYSIS
The questions Dr. Ackerman was retained to address are not crystal clear and are posed differently in each of defendant's submissions. According to Dr. Ackerman in the rebuttal report, he was retained to opine on "whether (1) the information submitted by Plaintiff . . . was sufficient to determine the scope of Plaintiff's orthopedic impairments; and (2) whether an accommodation would be appropriate based upon the information submitted by Plaintiff to the Agency." Ackerman Rebuttal Report ¶ 1; but see Def.'s Opp'n Br. at 1 (counsel posing the question as whether "Plaintiff submit[ted] sufficient evidence of a disability resulting in a substantial limitation of a major life [*6]  activity to support her accommodation request"); Ackerman Expert Report [Dkt. 45-1, ECF p. 8] ("I have been requested to review documents supplied by HUD and reach a conclusion regarding medical justification for the accommodation request."). Regardless of the question, Dr. Ackerman concludes as follows: "In view of all of the documents available to HUD as of February 18, 2011, I find no medical justification for the request for accommodation and therefore I concur with the opinion reached by Dr. James Allen." Rebuttal Report at 3 (incorporating by reference Expert Report at 3).
Plaintiff argues correctly that Dr. Ackerman does not mention in his report "Plaintiff's experts, their reports, or their opinion" and "[n]either of Plaintiff's medical experts opines or even address[es] the medical sufficiency of the documentation supporting [the underlying accommodation request]." Pl.'s Reply at 6, 7. Hence, defendant's attempt to convert his untimely and deficient opening report into a rebuttal report simply fails.
Furthermore, Dr. Ackerman's conclusory concurrence with Dr. Allen's opinion is cumulative and not significantly probative. Plaintiff rightly contends that "medical justification" [*7]  is not an element of a Rehabilitation Act claim. Pl.'s Reply at 10-13. See Floyd v. Lee, 968 F. Supp. 2d 308, 316 (D.D.C. 2013) (explaining that because "[t]he failure to accommodate is itself" a proscribed act of discrimination, "[t]he employer's motivation for refusing the accommodation" is irrelevant to the analysis) (citing Aka v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1288, 332 U.S. App. D.C. 256 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc)).2 In addition, the central question is not the "appropriate[ness]" of an accommodation, on which Dr. Ackerman purports to opine, but rather the reasonableness of the requested accommodation. See Loya v. Sebelius, 840 F. Supp. 2d 245, 258 (D.D.C. 2012) ("To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act for an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disability, a plaintiff must show (1) that [she] was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the employer had notice of [her] disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation [she] could perform the essential functions of the position; and (4) that the employer refused to make the accommodation.") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted; alterations in original).
Finally, "[a]n underlying assumption of any reasonable accommodation claim is that the plaintiff-employee has requested an accommodation which the defendant-employer [*8]  has denied." Flemmings v. Howard Univ., 198 F. 3d 857, 861, 339 U.S. App. D.C. 110 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Defendant may rebut plaintiff's claim by showing that the requested accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency, see Morris v. Jackson, 994 F. Supp. 2d 38, 45 (D.D.C. 2013), but Dr. Ackerman does not address this issue in his report and, as an outside consultant, he does not appear qualified to do so. See id. ("To determine what an appropriate, reasonable accommodation would be, an agency should 'initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual with a disability in need of accommodation.'") (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)).
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude the Report and Trial Testimony of Defendant's Expert, R. Marshall Ackerman, M.D. [Dkt. # 38], is GRANTED.
