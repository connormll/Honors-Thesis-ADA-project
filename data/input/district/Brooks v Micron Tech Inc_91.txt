Opinion



ORDER
This matter is before the Court on Defendant's Second Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 79). Upon consideration of the motion, the memoranda and exhibits in support thereof, plaintiff's opposition thereto, and oral argument held on May 28, 2010, and for the reasons below, the Court grants the motion.
In its motion, defendant Micron Technology, Inc. ("Micron") asks the Court to grant summary judgment in its favor on the one remaining claim in the case, in which plaintiff Garry Brooks ("Brooks") alleges that Micron failed to accommodate his disability as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.
The facts of this case are set out in detail in the Court's earlier summary judgment ruling, dated April 30, 2010, (Doc. Nos. 72 and 73), in which the Court granted summary judgment for Micron on Brook's third amended complaint as to Brooks' claims that Micron [*2]  regarded him as disabled in violation of the ADA and retaliated against him for his intention to file a worker's compensation claim in violation of Virginia Code Ann. § 65.2-308.
On April 9, 2010, Brooks filed a fourth amended complaint, in which he asserts, for the first time, that Micron failed to accommodate his actual disability. This claim contrasts sharply with his position before the filing of the fourth amended complaint that he was not actually disabled within the meaning of the ADA and therefore did not require an accommodation.
Summary judgment is appropriate only if the record shows that "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." FED. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Evans v. Technologies Applications & Serv. Co., 80 F.3d 954, 958-59 (4th Cir. 1996). The party seeking summary judgment has the initial burden to show the absence of a material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A genuine issue of material fact exists "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Once a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported, the opposing party has the burden of showing that a genuine dispute exists. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). To defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party "must set forth specific [*3]  facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48 ("[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.") (emphasis in original). Whether a fact is considered "material" is determined by the substantive law, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Id. at 248. The facts shall be viewed, and all reasonable inferences drawn, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Id. at 255; see also Lettieri v. Equant Inc., 478 F.3d 640, 642 (4th Cir. 2007).
The Court must first determine the existence vel non of a triable issue concerning whether or not Brooks is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. Under the ADA, to establish a disability Brooks must show that he has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. Tyndall v. National Educ. Ctrs., 31 F.3d 209, 212 (4th Cir. 1994); 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A)-(C).1 Major life activities are those activities that are of central importance to daily life, including walking, seeing, hearing, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. [*4]  Toyota Mtr. Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 197, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1999); Wilson v. Phoenix Specialty Manufacturing Co., 513 F.3d 378, 384 (4th Cir. 2008). A person is "substantially limited" in his ability to work if the employee is "significantly restricted in his ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes." Cline v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 294, 303 (4th Cir. 1998). Inability to perform a single particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(1).
In claiming he is disabled under the ADA, Brooks relies solely on the opinion of Micron's doctor, Dr. Ross Myerson, who found, after evaluating Brooks, that Brooks cannot safely lift seventeen pounds2 and that Brooks has reduced gripping strength due to his lack of thumbs, which limits his ability to safely hold heavy gas cylinders. Brooks has not put forth any evidence to support his claim that he is substantially limited in gripping, lifting, or working generally such that he cannot perform tasks that are central to daily life. Moreover, Brooks does not assert anywhere what major life activity he is substantially limited in performing. In fact, the record before the Court establishes that Brooks has impressively avoided being restricted in any major life activity because of his lack of opposable thumbs. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Brooks has [*5]  failed to put forth any fact that could establish that he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA.
Even if, however, the Court were to find that Brooks is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, the Court finds that Brooks has not established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Micron failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. Brooks has identified only one position within Micron, the Operator position, for which he was considered or should have been considered. Brooks has nowhere proffered what a reasonable accommodation would be as to the Operator position, as he is required to do. Stopka v. Medical University of South Carolina, No. 2:05-1728, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50357, 2007 WL 2022188, *11 (D.S.C. July 11, 2007) ("The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job rests with the plaintiff, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to demonstrating that such an accommodation is reasonable.") (citing Halperin v. Abacus Tech. Corp., 128 F.3d 191 (4th Cir. 1997) and Tyndall v. Nat'l. Educ. Ctrs., 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994)). Instead, Brooks asserts only that Micron should have provided Brooks with the opportunity to work without any accommodation as an Operator,3 a position that indisputably required lifting more than seventeen pounds as an essential function, because he could, in fact, meet [*6]  the physical requirements of that job. In short, Brooks argues that Micron failed to accommodate him when it refused to find that he could, in fact, meet the physical requirements of the Operator position. But such a finding would be inconsistent with the evidentiary basis Brooks relies on to establish his disability in the first place, viz., Dr. Myerson's opinion. There is no contention that the seventeen pound lifting requirement was not an essential, bona fide job requirement for the Operator position or that it was a pretext to avoid hiring Brooks. For that reason, there is no evidence upon which to conclude that Brooks was qualified to perform the Operator position. Micron was therefore not required to hire Brooks as an Operator because the ADA does not "require an employer to restructure the essential functions of a position to fit the skills of an individual with a disability who is not otherwise qualified to perform the position." Lusby v. Metropolitan Washington Airports Auth., 187 F.3d 630, (4th Cir. 1999) (unpublished) (internal quotations omitted).
Brooks argues that once Dr. Myerson concluded that Brooks could not lift seventeen pounds, Micron was then obligated to initiate a formal interactive process under the ADA to find a reasonable accommodation. [*7]  However, there is insufficient evidence to create a triable issue concerning whether Micron had sufficiently engaged with Brooks in an attempt to find an accommodation for the Operator position. Beyond stating his desire to work as an Operator, Brooks never told Micron that he wanted an accommodation or that he wanted to engage with Micron in a process to establish a reasonable accommodation, ostensibly because Brooks never thought he needed an accommodation in the first place. As this Court has previously explained, "[t]he EEOC guidelines place the burden of requesting an accommodation on the employee. Had Plaintiff needed additional accommodation, he had an affirmative duty to request it, which he did not. Consequently, Plaintiff cannot show that he was denied a reasonable accommodation." Hansberry v. Computer Engineering Sys. Groups, No. 97-1890-A, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13508 (E.D. Va. July 29, 1998). Here, not only did Brooks never request an accommodation, Brooks rejected the notion that he required any accommodation. As he stated in his EEOC charge, "I am fully capable of performing my most recent job at Micron. . . . I have no problem lifting heavy items. . . . I am more than capable of performing my job safely and reliably despite my disability, and am not looking for, nor do I require, [*8]  any special accommodations." He repeated these sentiments in his fourth amended complaint, stating that his "lack of thumbs" and "history of back surgeries did not impair his life" and that Books did not "ever seek, receive, or require any accommodation." Fourth amended complaint (Doc. No. 32-1) at ¶ 1.
The Court concludes, as a matter of law, that Micron did not fail to accommodate Brooks since Brooks has failed to produce any facts that establish that any reasonable accommodation was available as to a particular job and the only "accommodation" he was willing to accept required Micron to ignore the physical limitations that Dr. Myerson found existed and which Brooks relies on to establish his disability.
Because the Court concludes no genuine issue of material fact exists to establish that Brooks is disabled under the ADA or that, even if he were disabled, Micron failed to offer him a reasonable accommodation, it is hereby
ORDERED that Defendant's Second Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 79) be, and the same hereby is, GRANTED; and it is further
ORDERED that judgment be, and the same hereby is, entered in favor of defendant Micron Technology, Inc. and that this action be, and the [*9]  same hereby is, dismissed.
The Clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of defendant Micron Technologies, Inc. pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 and forward copies of this Order to all counsel of record.
This Order is final.
