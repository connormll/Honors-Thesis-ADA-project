Opinion



NON-FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is before the Court on Defendants Denise Roth and General Services Administration Region 4 Employees Association, Inc.'s ("GSA") joint motion to dismiss [Doc. 10] Plaintiff Dr. Karen King's Title VII complaint [Doc. 8.]. For the reasons discussed herein, I RECOMMEND that the Defendants' motion be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Specifically, Counts I, IV, and V should be [*2]  dismissed in their entirety, and Counts II and III should be limited as discussed in this report. Further, the GSA should be dismissed from the action.

I. Procedural history and facts
On June 27, 2015, King filed a complaint against the Defendants. [Doc. 1.] In December 2015, the Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and King filed an amended complaint shortly thereafter. [Docs. 6, 8.] On January 19, the Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. [Doc. 10.] King filed a response in opposition of the motion, and King replied. [Docs. 14, 15.]

A. King's first amended complaint
In her first amended complaint (hereinafter "the complaint"), King alleged that she filed a timely charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") office of the GSA and filed the instant suit within 90 days of receiving a right-to-sue letter. [Doc. 8 at 3-4.] King was hired in 2001 by the GSA to work in "Branch B" and remained in that branch with consistently favorable evaluations until 2012.1 [Id. at 5.] In April 2011, King applied for an open position as a Supervisory Realty Specialist, and in May 2011, the job was given to Scott Mowry, a white male. [Id. at 6.] In August 2011, King filed an EEO [*3]  complaint based on her non-selection for that job asserting discrimination based on race, sex, and age. [Id.] King withdrew that complaint on November 21, 2011. [Id.] On November 6, 2011, King was reassigned to Branch D, "a failing branch," but was not told about the reassignment until December 21. [Id. at 6-7.]
On February 29, 2012, King filed a new EEO complaint, asserting that her assignment to Branch D was retaliation for having filed her initial EEO complaint, and also alleging that the reassignment constituted discrimination based on race and sex. [Doc. 8 at 7.] King was the only female African-American section chief, the only section chief to be reassigned, and she was assigned to Branch D, which was comprised exclusively of African-American employees. [Id.] The GSA told King it was reassigning her because of her leadership qualities and to ameliorate the underwhelming performance of Branch D. [Id. at 8.] King disputed that reasoning, alleging that the Branch D branch chief, her new supervisor, was left intact, and King could not act without her approval. [Id.] The decision makers did not consult King on her reassignment and they all knew that Branch D underperformed relative to Branch B. [Id. [*4] ]
King alleged that her reassignment to Branch D was an adverse employment action because it was "less prestigious in that it was consistently failing, underperforming, and dysfunctional." [Doc. 8 at 9.] In Branch D, King was assigned "numerous problem projects." [Id.]
On December 4, 2012, King filed a grievance based on her performance evaluation, asserting that she lost performance bonuses because Branch D had lower production than her previous assignment. [Doc. 8 at 10.] King also received a lesser production rating than LaSonya Glover-Duncan, the branch chief, even though both ratings were based on Branch D's production. [Id. at 11.] King required medical accommodations for the stress caused from working in Branch D. [Id. at 12.] The GSA eventually denied King's request to telework as an accommodation, which resulted in King having to use over 100 hours of annual and sick leave in 2014 and 2015. [Id. at 14.] King retired in October 2015 under a 100% disability rating. [Id. at 15.]
King's complaint alleged the following five counts: Title VII gender discrimination (Count I); Title VII race discrimination (Count II); Title VII retaliation (Count III); discrimination and failure to accommodate under the ADAAA (Count IV); [*5]  and hostile work environment under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (Count V).
In Count I, King incorporated all previous portions of her complaint and alleged that GSA treated her less favorably than male employees and reassigned her, in part, because she is a female. [Doc. 8 at 16.] No other section chiefs were reassigned to another branch. [Id.] She alleged that her August 2011 EEO complaint alleged gender discrimination, and that her reassignment to Branch D was in retaliation for that complaint. [Id. at 16-17.] King alleged that the GSA's proffered reason for reassigning her—utilizing King's abilities to better the GSA—was pretextual, because the GSA left the same person in charge of Branch D. [Id. at 17.] King alleged that GSA's conduct deprived her of economic opportunities on account of her sex, resulting in loss of income and employment benefits and "other indignities." [Id. at 18.]
In Count II, titled Race Discrimination, King incorporated all previous portions of her complaint, and she alleged that her August 2011 EEO complaint concerned, in part, racial discrimination. [Doc. 8 at 19.] She alleged that her reassignment to Branch D was in retaliation for that complaint. [Id.] She alleged that, at the time of her reassignment, [*6]  all of the other section chiefs were white, and King was the only section chief to be reassigned. [Id. at 20.] King again alleged the pretextual nature of the GSA's stated reason for her reassignment and asserted the same harm as in Count I. [Id. at 20-21.]
In Count III, titled Retaliation, King incorporated all previous portions of her complaint, and alleged that her August 2011 EEO complaint was a protected activity. [Doc. 8 at 22.] She then alleged that her reassignment to Branch D was in retaliation for that EEO complaint. [Id. at 22-23.] She alleged a causal connection because she had worked in Branch B for over a decade and was reassigned within months of filing her first EEO complaint, and he alleged that the purported reason for her transfer was pretextual. [Id. at 23-25.] King also alleged that the reassignment was adverse, in part because she could not achieve the same performance ratings while working in the lower-performing branch. [Id. at 25-28.] King also alleged that the GSA, through its employees:
unjustifiably criticized Dr. King's job performance, reassigned her to a deteriorating branch, unfairly assigned Dr. King to deserted projects, denied reasonable accommodations, denied her an opportunity to work a detail or a temporary [*7]  assignment in another position, [and] commanded Dr. King to physically come into the office despite her telework schedule.
[Id. at 29.]
In Count IV, King incorporated the entirety of her complaint, and alleged that she is disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). [Doc. 8 at 30.] King alleged that the dysfunction of Branch D worsened her stress and required her to alter her working conditions. [Id. at 31.] The GSA only allowed King to telework as a reasonable accommodation for several months, and then stopped allowing the telework. [Id. at 31-32.] King alleged that the GSA's failure to accommodate her led to her disability retirement. [Id. at 33-34.]
In Count V, alleging a hostile work environment, King incorporated the entirety of her complaint. [Doc. 8 at 36.] King alleged that the GSA created a hostile and abusive environment. [Id.] She further alleged that the GSA failed to take corrective action upon notice of the issue. [Id.]

B. King's EEO complaint
On February 29, 2012, the GSA regional EEO office received a formal complaint from King. [Doc. 10-1.] In the complaint, King checked off the boxes for race and gender discrimination. In the description section, King wrote, "On 12/14/2011-I was informed that I [*8]  would be moved to a Branch and Section that is not functioning appropriately. I am the only African-American Section Chief and the only Section Chief being reassigned." [Id.]
On May 4, 2012, the GSA's regional EEO officer acknowledged receipt of King's complaint. [Doc. 10-2 at 1.] In that letter, the agency "accepted the following allegations for investigation:"
Whether or not you were subjected to discrimination based on your race (African American), sex (female) and reprisal (you previously filed a formal EEO complaint on August 22, 201[1]2 ), when on December 14, 2011, you were notified that you were being reassigned to Branch D in the Realty Acquisitions Division. You allege that you are the only Section Chief reassigned out of five Section Chiefs.
[Id.]

II. Discussion
As an initial matter, the parties appear to agree that GSA is not a proper Defendant to this suit. [Doc. 10 at 19; Doc. 14 at 24.] Accordingly, GSA should be dismissed, and the remainder of this report will treat Roth, as administrator of GSA, as the only Defendant.3 Roth challenges much of King's complaint both on the grounds that the claims are unexhausted and that they facially lack merit. I will discuss the exhaustion [*9]  issues for each claim first, and then proceed to the merits discussion of each of the exhausted claims.

A. Administrative exhaustion
Roth argues that King failed to administratively exhaust a number of the claims presented in the instant complaint. [Doc. 10 at 3.]
Amendments to Title VII, found in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16, contain the exclusive administrative and judicial scheme for the redress of claims of employment discrimination against the federal government. Brown v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 425 U.S. 820, 828-29 (1976). Under § 2000e-16, an employee is required to seek agency relief before pursuing a lawsuit in district court. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(c); Brown, 425 U.S. at 832; see also Ramirez v. U.S. Dep't of Transp., 686 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir. 2012). Failure to exhaust administrative remedies can properly result in the dismissal of the federal suit. Brown, 425 U.S. at 835; see also Crawford v. Babbitt, 186 F.3d 1322, 1327 (11th Cir. 1999). Claims under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA must be exhausted in the same manner prescribed for Title VII claims. See M.T.V. v. DeKalb Cty. Sch. Dist., 446 F.3d 1153, 1158 (11th Cir. 2006).
A claim is only exhausted if it is within the scope of the administrative review, limited to that "which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination." Gregory v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., 355 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 2004); see also Basel v. Sec'y of Def., 507 F. App'x 873, 875-76 (11th Cir. 2013) (applying same in suit filed by federal employee). The scope of the administrative complaint, however, should not be strictly interpreted, as the Court should be reluctant to allow a procedural technicality to bar a [*10]  Title VII claim. Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280.

1. King has not attempted to assert a claim based on GSA's decision not to promote her.
Roth first argues that King failed to exhaust her claims of discrimination related to her April and May 2011 non-selection for a promotion. [Doc. 10 at 4.] In response, King asserts that she raised no discrimination claim based on her non-selection for a promotion. [Doc. 14 at 2-3.]
My reading of the complaint is consistent with King's reading. The complaint alleges no claim based on the May 2011 non-promotion. Accordingly, there is no non-promotion claim to dismiss.

2. King's retaliation claim, Count III, is exhausted insofar as it alleges her reassignment and the accompanying consequences were retaliatory, but not insofar as she alleges any failure to accommodate a disability was retaliatory.
Roth next argues that Count III of the complaint, to the extent that it asserts retaliatory acts other than the reassignment from Branch B to Branch D, was not properly exhausted. [Doc. 10 at 6-7.] She argues that some of the alleged retaliatory acts occurred after the filing of King's administrative EEO complaint, and thus are necessarily outside the scope of the complaint. [Id. at 7.] Roth points [*11]  to the list of alleged acts in paragraph 86 of the complaint to identify where she believes King asserted retaliatory acts outside the scope of the EEO complaint. [Id.]
King responds that Roth is incorrect in asserting that the other retaliatory acts found in Count III were not exhausted. [Doc. 14 at 3.] She argues that Roth focuses only on the EEO complaint, when, in fact, the entire EEO record should be considered. [Id.]
King's assertion that the face of an EEO complaint should not be the strict limit of the scope of an eventual lawsuit is correct, to a point. Claims that are not explicitly mentioned on the face of an EEO charge may still be exhausted for purposes of filing a federal law suit. It is well established that any investigation that can reasonably be expected to grow out of the EEO charge itself may be alleged in a subsequent complaint. See Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280. But, under Gregory, the charge itself is still the focus in analyzing the scope of administrative exhaustion. King's assertion that anything mentioned in the course of EEO proceedings, regardless of what was alleged on the face of the EEO charge, [see Doc. 14 at 3-4], is unsupported.
The Eleventh Circuit has held that a retaliation claim [*12]  can reasonably be expected to grow out of a charge of discrimination where the employer was retaliating in response to the discrimination charge. Baker v. Buckeye Cellulose Corp., 856 F.2d 167, 169 (11th Cir. 1988). Addressing the issue of timeliness of an administrative charge, the Supreme Court has since held, however, that each discriminatory act, even if similarly motivated, "starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act." Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113 (2002).
Post-Morgan, Circuit Courts have differed on whether the Morgan holding also requires separate exhaustion for post-charge allegations of a separate retaliatory acts. Compare Wedow v. City of Kan. City, Mo., 442 F.3d 661, 674 (8th Cir. 2006) (holding that an administrative charge that alleges ongoing retaliatory acts properly exhausts any subsequent actions that are of the same type as alleged), with Martinez v. Potter, 347 F.3d 1208, 1210-11 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding that the post-charge retaliatory incidents cannot be exhausted based on the already existing administrative charge). It does not appear that the Eleventh Circuit has addressed Morgan's effect on exhaustion requirements in a published opinion. In one unpublished opinion, the Court acknowledged the conflicting authority as to whether Morgan required separate exhaustion for discrete acts of retaliation, but declined to settle the issue in this Circuit, as the defendants had not [*13]  challenged exhaustion. See Bennett v. Chatham Cty. Sheriff Dep't, 315 F. App'x 152, 162 n.7 (11th Cir. 2008). In several unpublished opinions, however, the Eleventh Circuit has applied Morgan to exhaustion issues, holding that post-charge conduct is not exhausted, although not apparently ever involving a post-charge retaliation claim. See Duble v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc., 572 F. App'x 889, 893 (11th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, 135 S.Ct. 2379 (2015) (post-charge termination claim); Basel v. Sec'y of Def., 507 F. App'x 873, 876-77 (11th Cir. 2013) (same); see also Council v. Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps. (AFGE) Union, 477 F. App'x 648, 653 (11th Cir. 2012) (pre-charge termination not included on face of charge).
Here, I need not decide whether Morgan applies, because the portions of Count III at issue are outside the scope of King's administrative charge for a more basic reason. King asserts, in paragraph 86 of her amended complaint, that the retaliation against her took the form of failure to accommodate, including a failure to allow for telework and a denial of a temporary assignment. [See Doc. 8 at 29.] Regardless of when those actions are alleged to have occurred, they are outside of the scope of the investigation that can reasonably be expected to have grown out of King's administrative charge of discrimination. See Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280. Nothing in the charge mentions or implies a continuing pattern of retaliation or any discrimination based on disability. [See Docs. 10-1, 10-2]. To the extent that King alleges that she was unfairly [*14]  assigned to deserted projects and received lower evaluations as a direct result of her reassignment to Branch D, on the other hand, I find that it is exhausted. The scope of Count III should be limited accordingly.

3. King failed to administratively exhaust her stand-alone disability discrimination claim, Count IV.
Roth next argues that Count IV of the complaint—King's disability discrimination claim—was not exhausted. [Doc. 10 at 8.] She first argues that, as the federal government is the defendant, the claim should have been brought under the Rehabilitation Act, not the ADA. [Id.] The disability claim exclusively concerns events that occurred in 2014 and 2015, after her reassignment to Branch D, and therefore entirely after King's 2012 EEO complaint. [Id. at 9-10.]
King responds that the disability claim was exhausted because her rebuttal, filed during the EEO process, outlined instances of disability discrimination. [Doc. 14 at 13.] Therefore, she argues, her disability claim is "like or related" to her EEO charges. [Id. at 14.]
Whether properly brought under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA, the exhaustion analysis is the same. See M.T.V., 446 F.3d at 1158. King makes no attempt to link her disability discrimination claim to [*15]  the administrative charge itself, arguing rather that she exhausted the claim by referring to her heightened anxiety in other EEO filings. [See Doc. 14 at 13-14.] As discussed in the previous section, King's contention that a claim can be exhausted in such a way where the claim is otherwise not "like or related to" the face of the charge, is unsupported.
King's EEO charge in no way refers to any disability or any failure on the GSA's part to accommodate a disability. [See Docs. 10-1, 10-2.] The charge, which alleged racial, gender, and retaliatory discrimination would not reasonably be expected to result in an investigation of how the GSA accommodated any disability. See Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280. King's standalone disability claim is even further beyond the scope of the administrative charge than the suggestion in Count III that the failure to accommodate was based on retaliation. Accordingly, I find that the claim is not exhausted, and Count IV should be dismissed.

4. King's hostile work environment claim is exhausted only insofar as her branch reassignment and accompanying work changes may have caused a hostile work environment.
Roth next argues that King failed to exhaust her hostile work environment claim. [*16]  [Doc. 10 at 10.] King never filed an EEO complaint that alleged a hostile work environment, and therefore cannot allege that any such claim was investigated. [Id. at 10-11.]
King responds that her allegations in the hostile work environment claim are sufficiently related to the allegations in the EEO charge to render the claim exhausted. [Doc. 14 at 9.] She also argues that her rebuttal, filed during the EEO process, brings the hostile work environment claim within the scope of the EEO proceedings. [Id. at 9-10, 11-13.]
King's hostile work environment claim fails to allege a single specific, non-conclusory fact as to what actions or circumstances created a hostile work environment. [See Doc. 8 at 36-37.] To the extent that any such factual assertion can be found in the claim, it is because King incorporated the entirety of her complaint into the claim. [See id. at 36.] Such a pleading practice is disfavored and, in many contexts, impermissible because it does not allow a defendant to meaningfully understand the nature of the claim against it. See Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Cent. Fla. Cmty. Coll., 77 F.3d 364, 366 (11th Cir. 1996) (calling a complaint where "it is virtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief" the "perfect example" of a shotgun pleading). [*17] 
Based on exhaustion principles, however, there is only a narrow set of alleged facts upon which the claim could be based. Insofar as King alleges that her reassignment to Branch D and the accompanying circumstances created a hostile work environment, I find that such a claim is properly exhausted. Those facts are within the scope of the investigation that would result from King's EEO charge, and I find that it would be overly restrictive to limit the scope to the legal theories alleged in the EEO charge. See Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 462 (5th Cir. 1970) (holding that the "crucial element" of the charge is the factual allegations and that a party should not be prevented from suing for alleging a different legal theory). For the same reasons discussed in the previous section, however, King cannot allege any failure to accommodate her disability, any criticism of her work, or any other factual matter as the basis of her hostile work environment claim, as it is unexhausted. See Rodriguez v. Sec'y of Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 605 F. App'x 957, 958 (11th Cir. 2015); Cotton v. G.S. Dev., 390 F. App'x 875, 877 (11th Cir. 2010) (involving a pro se charge); Fikes v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 322 F. App'x 882, 884 (11th Cir. 2009). Count V should be limited accordingly.

5. Conclusions regarding exhaustion
In light of the above, I reach the following conclusions regarding exhaustion of administrative remedies. Counts I, II, III, and V of King's complaint [*18]  are exhausted insofar as she alleges that her reassignment to Branch D was discriminatory, retaliatory, or created a hostile work environment. Count III's allegations that other employer conduct was retaliatory are outside the scope of the underlying EEO charge. Likewise, Count V's allegations that other conduct contributed to a hostile work environment are unexhausted. Count IV, alleging only disability discrimination, is not exhausted, and accordingly should be dismissed in its entirety.

B. King alleges sufficient facts to make plausible her allegation that her reassignment from Branch B to Branch D was an adverse employment action.

1. The parties' arguments
Roth argues that, as to the claims concerning her reassignment from Branch B to Branch D, King failed to sufficiently allege a material adverse employment action. [Doc. 10 at 11-12.] She argues that King failed to articulate any way in which the reassignment constituted a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of her employment. [Id. at 13.] Specifically, King did not allege that the reassignment came with a reduction in pay, prestige, or responsibility. [Id. at 13-14.] To the extent that King asserts that performance evaluations [*19]  after the transfer constituted an adverse action, such a claim was not exhausted. [Id. at 14.] Moreover, King alleged an increase—not a reduction—in responsibility. [Id.]
King responds that her reassignment was adverse because her award of performance money was tied to the productivity level of her branch, and it was known that Branch D, unlike Branch B, consistently failed to produce at a level that would allow for the performance bonus. [Doc. 14 at 18-19.] As a result of the reassignment, King began to receive lower performance ratings and, therefore, lower compensation. [Id. at 19.] She also asserts that the reassignment resulted in King occupying a less prestigious position, as the mismanagement of Branch D reflected poorly upon her and forced her to work on projects with "long-standing issues." [Id. at 20-21.]

2. Motion to dismiss standard in employment cases
"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). The complaint need not contain "detailed factual allegations," but it must "give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (quotation [*20]  omitted). Something "more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action" is required. Id. at 555.
A plaintiff in an employment discrimination case does not need to plead specific facts establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, as defined in McDonnell Douglas,4 to survive a motion to dismiss. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 508, 514, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). Consistent with the general standard, the complaint need not contain more allegations than necessary to make relief plausible and give the respondent fair notice of the grounds upon which the plaintiff's claims rest. Id.; see also Surtain v. Hamlin Terrace Found., 789 F.3d 1239, 1246 (11th Cir. 2015). Swierkiewicz, however, does not obviate the requirements that a complaint give notice of the factual allegations that make a claim plausible and contain more than mere conclusory allegations. Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., 372 F.3d 1250, 1270-71 (11th Cir. 2004). Unsupported conclusions of law or of mixed law and fact are insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. Cooley v. Great S. Wood Preserving, 138 F. App'x 149, 152 (11th Cir. 2005).

3. Discussion
Whether an employment action is adverse is determined on an objective basis, and turns on whether a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would view the employment action as adverse. Doe v. DeKalb Cty. Sch. Dist., 145 F.3d 1441, 1448-49 (11th Cir. 1998) (an ADA case); see also Hinson v. Clinch Cty., Ga. Bd. of Educ., 231 F.3d 821, 829 (11th Cir. 2000) (applying Doe in the Title VII context). In the case of a lateral transfer, an employee's preference [*21]  for her original position is not sufficient to find adversity. Doe, 145 F.3d at 1449. If a transfer involves a pay cut, it is adverse. Hinson, 231 F.3d at 829.
Roth argues that King's complaint is deficient because it does not allege that her pay was reduced as a result of her reassignment, but rather alleges that she lost out on pay because of lower performance evaluations. [See Doc. 10 at 14.] Defendant's argument does not capture the basis of King's claim entirely accurately. King alleges that her performance evaluation was tied to the performance of her branch and that being assigned to Branch D was the cause of her declining evaluation ratings. [See Doc. 8 at 10-11.] In short, King alleges that the lower evaluation and accompanying pay reduction were necessary results of her reassignment. If it is true that King was reassigned to a branch where it was necessarily more difficult to achieve the same pay, then I find that the reassignment can plausibly constitute an adverse employment action. See Hinson, 231 F.3d at 829. Accepting the allegations in King's complaint, therefore, as true, I find that she has plausibly alleged an adverse employment action to support her discrimination and retaliation claims.

C. King fails to state a plausible claim for [*22]  gender discrimination.
Roth argues that King's complaint fails to allege that any comparable non-female was treated more favorably than her. [Doc. 10 at 15-16.] She only alleges that she is a female and was the only section chief to be reassigned, and she concludes that it was partially based on the fact that she is female. [Id. at 16.] Unlike her race discrimination claim, King does not allege that the other section chiefs were all of a different gender. [Id.] Accordingly, Roth argues, King has failed to allege any facts that suggest she was treated disparately based on gender. [Id. at 16-17.]
King responds that her reassignment was based in part on her gender and that no other section chief was reassigned to another branch. [Doc. 14 at 22.] She asserts that she was transferred to work under another female because of their shared gender. [Id. at 23.] She further asserts that the fact that no other section chiefs were assigned supports her inference along with the fact that others "white males and females" who filed EEO complaints were not reassigned. [Id.]
King's complaint alleges several times that she was transferred to Branch D because of her gender. [See, e.g., Doc. 8 ¶¶ 19, 49, 50, 53.] At no point in the complaint, [*23]  however, does King assert any non-conclusory fact that would make such a claim plausible. King's assertion in her response that she was deliberately assigned to work for another female is not found in her complaint. The only relevant facts that King alleges is that she is a female and that she was the only section chief to have been reassigned. [See id. at 4, 7.] But, in contrast to her accompanying allegation that all of the other section leaders were white, she does not allege that she was the only female section leader. [See id. at 7.] If anything, the fact that other women held the same position as King and were not reassigned undermines, rather than supports, her gender discrimination claim.
In short, King alleges not even basic factual matter to support a gender discrimination claim, offering only a conclusory assertion that she was reassigned, in part, based on her gender. Effectively, King alleged only that she was reassigned and that she is female. Even under permissive notice pleading standards, that is not sufficient to give Roth fair notice of a plausible gender discrimination claim. Accordingly, Count I is due to be dismissed.

D. In failing to allege any harassing, intimidating, or otherwise [*24]  hostile conduct, King has failed to state a hostile work environment claim.
Roth last argues that King failed to state a claim for a hostile work environment. [Doc. 10 at 17.] She argues that King failed to allege any facts that could plausibly meet the standard for establishing a hostile work environment, and that King's reassignment, by itself, cannot meet the standard. [Id. at 18.]
King argues that the circumstances surrounding her reassignment coupled with the failure to accommodate and lower performance evaluations contributed to a hostile work environment. [See Doc. 14 at 9.] Most of King's argument concerning her hostile work environment claim addresses its exhaustion, but she does assert that the events leading to her "constructive discharge" created a "retaliatory hostile work environment." [Id. at 13.]
A hostile work environment claim can be established upon proof that "the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., 277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002) (quotation omitted). Including the above, there are five elements to a hostile work environment claim: (1) the [*25]  plaintiff belongs to a protected group; (2) she has been subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment must have been based on a protected characteristic of the employee; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatory abusive working environment; and (5) the employer is responsible for the environment under vicarious or direct liability. Id. Merely reciting the formulaic elements of a hostile work environment claim is not sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. Edwards v. Prime, Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1300-01 (11th Cir. 2010).
As discussed earlier, Count V of King's complaint contains no factual allegations, and offers only a conclusion that the GSA and its employees created a hostile and abusive environment. [See Doc. 8 at 36.] To the extent that facts can be taken from other sections of the complaint, King alleges no actual harassing conduct by any supervisor or coworker. The complaint, therefore, does not state a plausible basis to believe that the workplace was "permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult," as there is no allegation of any single intimidating, ridiculing, or insulting occurrence. Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993) (quotation omitted). The mere fact [*26]  of a negative performance review, while perhaps part of an adverse employment action, does not support an allegation of a hostile work environment unless the review itself is hostile. See Brooks v. Grundmann, 748 F.3d 1273, 1276-77, 409 U.S. App. D.C. 299 (D.C. Cir. 2014).
In responding to the motion to dismiss, King does not point to any alleged harassing incidents, but more or less argues that her reassignment and the consequences thereof were sufficiently hostile. [See Doc. 14 at 9.] Those incidents are properly pleaded as part of King's retaliation and race discrimination claims. She has not shown any basis for allowing them to serve as the basis for a hostile work environment claim.

III. Conclusion
In light of the above, I make the following recommendations. I RECOMMEND that Roth's motion to dismiss be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Counts I, IV, and V should be dismissed in their entirety. Counts II and III should be allowed to proceed against Roth but should be limited in their adverse employment action to King's reassignment from Branch B to Branch D and any of the consequences thereof. Further, the GSA should be dismissed from the suit. Should the district judge adopt these recommendations, or otherwise allow the case to proceed as to any claim, Roth's [*27]  answer to the remaining claims will be due within 21 days of entry of that order.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 16th day of May, 2016.
