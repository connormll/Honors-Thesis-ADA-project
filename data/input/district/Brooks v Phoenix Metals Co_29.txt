Opinion



ORDER
This civil case under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") comes before the Court on United States Magistrate Judge John K. Larkins, III's Final Report and Recommendation [Doc. 76], and Plaintiff Stanley Brooks' Objections to the Report and Recommendation [Doc. 78] For the reasons stated below, Brooks' Objections to the Report and Recommendation [Doc. 78] are OVERRULED, and Judge Larkins' Report and Recommendation [Doc. 76] is ADOPTED IN FULL.

I. Factual Background
The following facts are taken from the Magistrate Judge's [*2]  Report and Recommendation ("R&R"). Neither party specifically objected to the facts as recited in the R&R. Accordingly, those facts are presented below:

A. Background, on Phoenix Metals
Phoenix Metals is a metals processor and distributor headquartered, in Norcross, Georgia. It employs truck drivers to pick up and deliver metals from its vendors and customers. Its drivers are compensated by the number of stops they make, the miles they drive, and the pounds and skids they carry on their trucks. If a driver is delayed at a stop, he or she is also paid for the time spent waiting.
At the time relevant to this case, Phoenix Metals dispatchers assigned drivers their routes and the specific stops along their routes. Phoenix Metals used kind of a flexible system, so drivers could ask for certain routes. Some routes paid better than others. To reduce pay disparities among drivers of different routes, the routes were "shuffled around," so that drivers were required "to run bad routes from time to time" but also had good routes. Phoenix Metals also maintained a "forced dispatch" policy, which provided that a driver [could] be automatically fired for refusing to accept a dispatch to deliver or pick [*3]  up a load. A driver did not have to accept a dispatch if he or she was sick or had reached the regulatory limit set forth [by the] U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT").
About once a month, drivers asked Phoenix Metals transportation manager, Bill Dyon, whether he could have another driver cover a stop. At least on some occasions, Dyon was able to accommodate such a request.
Phoenix Metals' top supplier of specialty metals was Ta Chen, a facility located about five or six miles from the Phoenix Metals terminal in Norcross. Dispatchers assigned two trips each day to Ta Chen, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The afternoon Ta Chen pickup should, have taken a driver' an hour roundtrip, but driver's could expect the trip to take additional time because Ta Chen employees did not always have the pickup ready when the driver arrived. The average afternoon Ta Chen trip took about 90 minutes roundtrip, although it could take longer. When possible, dispatch tried to rotate the Ta Chen pickups among the drivers.
DOT regulations allow a driver to work for 14 on-duty hours, with a 30 minute break. A driver may spend 11 of those on-duty hours actually driving. As relevant here, Phoenix [*4]  Metals used a system called PeopleNet to track driver hours for purposes of those DOT regulations. . . . Supervisors and dispatchers accessed PeopleNet records through a web or phone application to track employees' locations and DOT hours.

B. Brooks' [] employment with Phoenix Metals
For about ten years, Brooks worked as a truck driver at Phoenix Metals. He worked directly for Phoenix Metals for about two years and, before that, for companies that distributed Phoenix Metals products before it brought its truck driving operation m-house. During his . . . [most recent years with Phoenix Metals, Brooks] was assigned [to drive] the Northeast City Route, [a local day shift route].
Brooks and other day shift drivers began and ended their work day at the Phoenix Metals warehouse in Norcross. As a day shift driver, Brooks was not expected to load his truck before departing for the day, because third shift employees preloaded his truck the night before. Brooks usually had to depart the Norcross facility at 5:30 [a.m.], although drivers were often delayed and departed after the 5:30 start time. Before leaving the Phoenix Metals terminal to begin work for the day, Brooks was expected, to [perform [*5]  various tasks, which could take approximately 50 to 80 minutes to perform]. Ostensibly, Brooks was supposed to log in to the PeopleNet system before beginning those tasks to report that he was on duty. He and other drivers were instructed, however, not to log in to PeopleNet until closer to their time of departure from the terminal so that they could "save" hours. Thus, Brooks often delayed recording his time on duty for about thirty minutes or an hour.
Brooks knew about and understood Phoenix Metals' forced dispatch policy. He also knew that, if he was "close on hours," he was supposed to notify his supervisors and return to the terminal.
Brooks experienced knee pain toward the end of his employment with Phoenix Metals. On one occasion, in May 2015, Brooks arrived at work in the morning, prepared his truck, and went into the terminal warehouse to retrieve his paperwork. He suddenly experienced shooting pain in his leg, causing his leg to give out. . . . [H]e told a driver supervisor, Randall Gibson, that he could not take the load. Gibson allowed him to go home.
Brooks also left work early one day because of knee pain. He recalled, "[I] [c]ame back off a route, and they wanted me to [*6]  go somewhere and I told them I couldn't because I was hurting. And I went home." He could not recall the exact date on which this event happened but knew that it occurred before he applied for FMLA leave. Ronnie Murphy, Jr., a dispatcher, also recalled this incident. Brooks "told [Murphy] that his knee was hurting and that he wanted to go home. [Murphy] said OK and [Brooks] left."
On several occasions during his employment with Phoenix Metals, Brooks was disciplined. He received written warnings for failure to watch, training videos, not logging out of PeopleNet, departing late for his scheduled route, improperly loading his trailer, and delivering incorrect materials to customers.

C. Brooks' [] FMLA request
On April 19, 2015 [] Brooks requested to take FMLA leave for knee surgery scheduled for June 1, 2015. On May 7, 2015 [] the Phoenix Metals human resources department approved his FMLA request and authorized him to take leave from June 1, 2015 [] to August 24, 2015 Phoenix Metals management knew about Brooks'[] FMLA leave because they approved his FMLA leave, and Brooks had discussed his upcoming leave with Murphy. Brooks also discussed his knee pain with his supervisors and dispatchers. [*7] 

D. Brooks' [] termination
Brooks' [] last day driving for Phoenix Metals was May 21, 2015 He arrived at work and began preparing his truck at 4:15 a.m., butt consistent with Phoenix Metals' instructions to delay logging into PeopleNet, Brooks did not sign in and begin logging "on[-]duty hours until 5:15 a.m. Brooks was assigned 24 stops that day, while the previous two days he had been assigned only 12 to 13 stops.
That day, Phoenix Metals' dispatchers were Murphy and Jeff Franklin. Dispatch assigned the afternoon Ta Chen pickup to Brooks. Brooks did not want to go to Ta Chen. It is undisputed that Brooks refused to go to Ta Chen, but the parties disagree on the circumstances of that refusal....
According to dispatcher Murphy, between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m., dispatch sent Brooks a message through PeopleNet instructing him to make the Ta Chen pickup. Later that afternoon, Phoenix Metals' transportation administrator Trevor Peterson saw Brooks at the terminal, and asked him, in person, to make the Ta Chen run. Brooks stated that he wanted to go to the store to buy a cell phone and "complained that other drivers had gotten back before him and that one of them could have gone to make the stop." [*8]  A few minutes later, Brooks went into the dispatch office, and Murphy asked him to go to Ta Chen. Brooks refused, explained he wanted a new cell phone for work, and "complained that other drivers had gotten back before him and could have gone to make the stop." Brooks asked whether he was going to be fired or suspended from work because of his refusal to do the Ta Chen pickup, and when Murphy said that he did not know, Brooks left the terminal.
According to Brooks, he was assigned the Ta Chen pickup earlier. At about 3:20 [p.m.], when he was back at the Phoenix Metals terminal in between stops, he told Murphy, "I can't go to Ta Chen. I'm hurting." He also recalled that he told Murphy, "I'm not going to be able to go to Ta Chen. I'm going to be out of hours." At the time, he did not mention that he wanted to buy a new phone, but he did eventually buy a phone after he left work that day. After his conversation with Murphy, Brooks made his next two stops and another pickup, completing all of his assignments except for the Ta Chen pickup, and returned to the terminal at around 4:45 or 5:00 p.m. Brooks logged out of PeopleNet and went "off[-]duty" at 5:19 p.m. He did not speak to anyone, [*9]  took his personal belongings, and left work.
After Brooks refused the Ta Chen pickup, dispatch had another driver, Gary Stephens, make the pickup after he returned from Chattanooga. Stephens made the trip in one hour, although it appears that he did not have to make the first leg of the trip from Norcross to Ta Chen. Stephens went on[-]duty at 5:19 [a.m.] on May 21 and went off[-]duty at 7:18 [p.m.], nearly 14 hours later. Other Phoenix Metals drivers were available and could have made the Ta Chen pickup as well.
That evening, Murphy called driver supervisor Gibson, who called Dyon, to report Brooks' [] refusal to go to Ta Chen. Murphy also called Dyon. Dyon asked Gibson to keep Brooks at the terminal in the morning so that he could discuss the issue with Brooks.
The next day, May 22, Brooks reported to work at about 4:15 [a.m.] and prepared his truck, but Gibson asked him not to leave the terminal so that he could talk to transportation manager Dyon. Brooks waited for Dyon until about 6:00 or 7:00 [a.m.]. Brooks testified that, when Dyon arrived, he said "it looks like we're going to have to part ways." Brooks asked why, and Dyon replied, "You refused a load." Brooks explained that he [*10]  was "out of hours" and had completed more than 22 stops, and Dyon responded, "That doesn't matter." Dyon "threw up his hand." Brooks did not mention that he had refused the Ta Chen pickup because his knee was hurting.
After that, Brooks asked to speak to a higher-level supervisor but was told that it was no use and that the supervisor would not arrive at work until 8:00 [a.m.], so Brooks lett. In Brooks [] personnel file, the reason for his termination was refusal of dispatch." The explanation was:
Driver was notified that he needed to do a pickup at Ta Chen and driver refused saying he did not want to go and left. Driver had hours to do job [and] it is on his normal route. Driver stated he did not care if he was fired or suspended because he wasn't going.
Brooks denied that he said those things. Before Brooks was fired, Phoenix Metals had not terminated an employee for violating the forced dispatch policy.

E. Todd. Brooks' [] employment with. Phoenix Metals
Brooks' [] son, Todd Brooks, also was an employee driver for Phoenix Metals until December 2014, although he was fired and rehired several times while employed there, and he later worked as a contractor for Phoenix Metals. When Phoenix [*11]  Metals had drivers log their hours manually, Todd Brooks usually began logging his hours between 4:00 [a.m.] and 5:00 [a.m.] to avoid the 14-hour requirement, and when drivers began using PeopleNet, he was instructed not to log in until he was ready to leave for the day. Todd Brooks usually logged into [PeopleNet] about 45 to 90 minutes after starting work.
On one occasion, Todd Brooks reported to work at 3:30 or 3:45 [a.m.]. At 6:30 [p.m.], after making more than 20 stops, he returned to the Phoenix Metals facility in Norcross. Dispatch told him to go to Ta Chen, and he refused. Todd Brooks testified that transportation manager Dyon was "mad" and gave him a different route for a few weeks but did not fire him. [Doc. 76 at 3-15 (internal citations and footnotes omitted)].

II. Procedural Background
On October 12, 2015 Brooks filed a Complaint alleging that his former employer Phoenix Metals Company and its parent company Reliance Steel and Aluminum Company (hereinafter Reliance) violated the FMLA by interfering with Brooks' planned FMLA leave, and Joy retaliating against him for requesting FMLA leave [Doc. 1]. Phoenix Metals and Reliance answered on November 6, 2015 [Doc. 5]. On March [*12]  16, 2016 the parties voluntarily dismissed Reliance from the case [Doc. 24].
On May 18, 2016 Brooks filed a Complaint against ms former employer Phoenix Corporation for discrimination and retaliation under the ADA. Brooks v. Phoenix Corp., No. 1:16-CV-01602-ODE, Doc. 1 (N.D. Ga. May 18, 2016). On June 10, 2016, Phoenix Corporation answered. Brooks v. Phoenix Corp., Doc. 5. On July 12, 2016, the Court consolidated, the two cases under the case number for the FMLA case. Brooks v. Phoenix Corp., Doc. 7. The Court docketed the ADA Complaint and Phoenix Corporation's Answer in the consolidated case [Docs. 40, 41].
On September 12, 2016 Brooks filed a Motion for Sanctions and Attorneys' Fees based on alleged spoliation of evidence [Doc. 55] Phoenix Metals responded [Doc. 56], and Brooks replied [Doc. 62].
On October 3, 2016 Phoenix Metals filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [Docs. 60, 61] Brooks responded [Docs. 67, 68] and Phoenix Metals replied [Docs. 69, 70, 71, 72].
On May 11, 2017 United States Magistrate Judge Larkins heard oral argument on Brooks' Motion for Sanctions and Attorneys' Fees and Phoenix' Motion for Summary Judgment [Docs. 73, 75].
On May 22, 2017 Magistrate Judge Larkins issued [*13]  a Report and Recommendation [Doc. 76]. The R&R denied Brooks Motion for Sanctions and Attorneys' Fees for three reasons [Id. at 24-26]. First, Brooks had not been prejudiced by the loss of PeopleNet records regarding the availability of other drivers [Id. at 24-25]. Second, the amended Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) did not apply to Brooks [Id. at 25]. Third, even if the amended Rule did apply, Phoenix Metals did not act with bad faith or intent to deprive when the PeopleNet documents were lost [Id. at 26]. The R&R also denied a request by Phoenix Metals for attorneys' fees [Id. at 26-27].
The R&R recommended granting Phoenix Metals' Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 76]. The R&R found that Brooks' FMLA interference claim failed, because his termination was wholly unrelated to his requested. FMLA leave [Id. at 29-44]. Brooks gave eight reasons why his termination was in fact related to his FMLA leave [Id. at 32-44]. Those reasons were: (1) he was set up to of fail, 2) Dyon was acting as a cat's paw for Murphy, (3) Brooks' termination occurred shortly after Brooks' FMLA leave was approved, (4) other drivers were available to take the May 21 afternoon Ta Chen delivery, (5) Brooks' refusal to take the Ta Chen load was due to knee pain, and he had previously refused an assignment without punishment, [*14]  (6) Brooks was nearly out of DOT hours when he refused the Ta Chen run, (7) other drivers, including Todd Brooks, had violated the forced dispatch policy without punishment, and (8) there were discrepancies in testimony about the timing and circumstances of the Ta Chen assignment, and about why Brooks refused the Ta Chen load [Id.]. The R&R found that these arguments were all without merit or unsupported by the evidence [Id.].
The R&R next found that Brooks FMLA retaliation claim failed because Brooks failed to show that Phoenix Metals' purported legitimate reason for terminating him was pretextual [Id. at 44-47]. The R&R found that Brooks likely abandoned his claims for ADA discriminatory discharge and retaliation by not addressing them in responding to Phoenix Metals' Motion for Summary Judgment [Id. at 47-48]. Even if he could make a prima facie case for these claims, however, the R&R found that the claims would fail because Brookes did not show that Phoenix Metals' reason for discharging him was pretext for discrimination [Id. at 48-49]. Finally, the R&R found that Brooks' ADA failure to accommodate claim failed because Brooks did not specifically request accommodation [Id. at 49-51].
On June 5, 2017 Brooks filed Objections to [*15]  the R&R [Doc. 788] Accordingly, this matter is now ripe before the Court

III. Discussion

A. Legal Standard
The Court will grant summary judgment when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (a). The movant "always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of 'the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (citation omitted). "[T]he substantive law will identify which facts are material." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
Only after the moving party meets this initial burden does any obligation arise on the part of the nonmoving party. Chanel, Inc. v. Italian Activewear of Fla., Inc., 931 F.2d 1472, 1477 (11th Cir. 1991). At that time, the nonmoving party must present "significant, probative evidence demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of fact." Id. If the nonmoving party fails to do so, the moving party is entitled to summary judgment. United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop., 941 F.2d 1428, 1438 (11th Cir. 1991).
All evidence and justifiable factual inferences should be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Rollins v. TechSouth, Inc., 833 F.2d 1525, 1532 (11th Cir. 1987); Everett v. Napper, 833 F.2d 1507, 1510 (11th Cir. 1987). "Credibility determinations, the weighing [*16]  of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge . . . ." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. However, "the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Id. at 247-48 (emphases in original).
Under the FMLA, an eligible employee can take up to 12 workweeks of leave in any 12 month period for, inter alia, a serious health condition that renders the employee unable to perform his job duties. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a) (1). The FMLA also entitles the employee to commence FMLA leave. Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir. 201)). Upon return from FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to be restored to his previous position, or placed in an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions. 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(1).
To have a claim for FMLA interference, the employee must show that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled under the FMLA. Martin v. Brevard Cty. Pub. Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1266-67 (11th Cir. 2008) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1), Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of the City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1206-07 (11th Cir. 2001)). The employee need not show that the "employer intended to deny the right; the employer's motives are irrelevant." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208. An employer is not liable for interference with the right to commence FMLA leave, however, if it can show [*17]  that the employee would have been dismissed regardless of the request for FMLA leave Krutzig, 602 F.3d 1231, 1236. The question for the Court is whether the FMLA leave was the proximate cause of the employee's discharge. Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236, 1242 (11th Cir. 2010).
The FMLA also prohibits retaliation against an employee for exercising or attempting to exercise his FMLA rights. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2615 (a) (1) - (2). In the words of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit:
the substance of the FMLA . . .is that an employer may not do bad things to an employee who has exercised or attempted to exercise any rights under the statute. Asking for medical leave is exercising or attempting to exercise a right under the statute, and being fired is a bad thing.
Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 n.5 (11th Cir. 2000).
Where there is no direct evidence of discrimination, FMLA retaliation claims are evaluated under the burden-shifting framework laid out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Brungart, 231 F.3d 791, 798. Under this framework, the employee must establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing he engaged in protected conduct, suffered an adverse employment action, and there was a causal connection between the conduct and the adverse action. Id. The employee can show a causal connection by showing the adverse action came shortly after the protected conduct. Id. at 799.
If the employee makes [*18]  a prima facie case, the employer must show a legitimate reason for the adverse action. Smith v. BellSouth Telecomms. Inc., 273 F.3d 1303, 1314 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802). If the employer does so, the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the supposedly legitimate reason is pretextual. Id. (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 804). A plaintiff shows pretext by "revealing 'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies or contradictions in [the] proferred legitimate reasons . . . that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.'" Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp. Inc., 509 F.3d 1344, 1348 (11th Cir. 2007 (quoting Cooper v. S. Co., 390 F.3d 695, 725 (11th Cir. 2004)).
The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against qualified employees regarding the terms and conditions of employment on the basis of the employee's disability. 42 U.S.C § 12112 A disability is defined under the ADA as, inter alia, a physical impairment that substantially limits the individual's ability to work. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1) (A), 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) (A). The Court evaluates an ADA discriminatory discharge or retaliation claim under the McDonnell Douglas framework. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc,, 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004) (ADA discriminatory discharge), Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998) (citing Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997)) (ADA retaliation).
The ADA also requires an employer to make reasonable accommodations" for a disabled, but otherwise qualified employee "unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship [*19]  on the [employer]. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To determine the appropriate accommodations, trie employer and employee may need to engage in an "informal, interactive process." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3).
The employee has the initial responsibility to inform the employer of the need for accommodations. Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home. Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 1999). An employer's duty to provide reasonable accommodations does not arise unless "a specific demand for an accommodation has been made" by the employee. Id. at 1363. In fact, an employer need not even engage in the interactive process of determining a reasonable accommodation until the employee makes a specific request. Williamson v. Clarke Cty. Dep't of Human Res., 834 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1320 (S.D. Ala. 2011) (citing E.E.O.C. v. C.R. England, Inc., 644 F.3d 1028, 1049 (10th Cir. 2011)).
Under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), the Court must conduct a de novo review of those portions of the R&R to which the parties object. The Court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings and recommendations made by the Magistrate Judge. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 673-74, 100 S. Ct. 2406, 65 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1980). For a party's objections to warrant de novo review, the party "must clearly advise the district court and pinpoint the specific findings that the party disagrees with." United States v. Schultz, 565 F.3d 1353, 1360 (11th Cir. 2009). The remainder of the R&R, to which neither party offers specific objections, will be assessed for clear error only. See Tauber v. Barnhart, 438 F. Supp. 2d 1366, 1373 ((.D. Ga. 2006) (Story, J.).

B. Brooks' Objections
Brooks raises six specific objections to the R&R [Doc. [*20]  88]. First, he argues that the Magistrate Judge failed to properly consider how extraordinary it was for Brooks to have been assigned 22 stops on May 21 [Id. at 5-6]. According to Brooks, this high number of stops--with only Brooks being assigned the additional stop at the end of the day--reasonably leads to the inference that Phoenix Metals was setting him up so they could terminate him [Id.]. Brooks next argues that the Magistrate Judge erred by not inferring from dispatcher Murphy's admissions and Brooks' testimony that Brooks had requested another driver do the Ta Chen trip [Id. at 6-8]. Brooks' third objection is that the Magistrate Judge erred in not inferring that Dyon failed to do an independent investigation, which would support Brooks' cat's paw theory [Id. at 8-9].
Brooks next argues that Phoenix Metals had previously accommodated him [Id. at 10]. Further, reasonable inferences from Brooks' testimony and admissions by Murphy lead to the conclusion that Brooks requested another driver be assigned the Ta Chen load [Id.]. Thus, the Magistrate Judge erred in finding that Phoenix Metals did not terminate Brooks based on his upcoming FMLA leave [Id.]. Brooks' fifth argument is that a justifiable inference could be made [*21]  that he requested the Ta Chen load be assigned to another driver [Id. at 10-11]. As such, the Magistrate Judge erred by not considering Phoenix Metals' previous accommodation of requests by other drivers to have a stop reassigned as evidence of pretext [Id.]. Finally, Brooks argues that the Magistrate Judge erred in denying his Motion for Sanctions [Id. at 11-12]. Because it could be reasonably inferred that Brooks requested another driver take the Ta Chen load, the availability of other drivers is material and relevant, and sanctions for PeopleNet's loss of records are appropriate [Id.].

1. 22 Deliveries as a Set Up
In support of his set up argument, Brooks argued that he was terminated because his superiors were "less than pleased" that his knee issues were covered by the ADA, and he was soon to take FMLA leave [Doc. 67 at 8]. Brooks argued that the 22 stops he was assigned on May 21 were the most of any driver during March, April, or May, and were a set up to terminate him, especially considering other drivers were available to make the Ta Chen trip [Id. at 8-9, 11-13].
Despite the large number of stops Brooks was assigned on May 21, 2015 Brooks' set up argument fails. First, there is no evidence in the record to show that [*22]  Brooks' superiors were displeased with his knee condition, or with his upcoming FMLA leave. Second, Brooks logged in as on-duty at 5:15 a.m. on May 21, 2015; he logged off at 5:19 p.m. that evening. He thus had close to two hours remaining when he logged off before he would be over his DOT-allowed hours. He could expect it to take 90 minutes to do the Ta Chen run. Brooks thus had time remaining to do the run. Further, Brooks knew he could be fired for refusing to take a load. Finally, Phoenix Materials rotated the Ta Chen run among its drivers. On that basis, Brooks set up argument fails.

2. Inferring Brooks asked, that the Ta Chen Run Be Reassigned
Brooks asserted that he asked that another driver be assigned the May 21 Ta Chen load [Doc. 67-1 ¶ 49 (citing Docs. 67-10 at 72, 75, 67-11 at 78-79, 81, 83, 67-12 at 59, 67-13 at 46, 64, 74, 76-77)]. The Magistrate Judge found that this assertion was unsupported by the evidence [Doc. 76 at 11 n.4]. Having reviewed the underlying evidence [Docs. 67-10 at 72, 75, 67-11 at 78-79, 81, 83, 67-12 at 59, 67-13 at 46, 64, 74, 76-77], the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge. At best, this evidence [id.] shows that Brooks told a superior that he [*23]  did not want to do the Ta Chen run because his knee hurt, and he was out of hours. The evidence [id.] does not support the claim that Brooks requested, that another driver be assigned the Ta Chen run.
Brooks also claimed that Murphy "confirmed that Brooks 'complained that other drivers had gotten back before him and that one of them could have gone to make the Ta Chen stop'" [Doc. 67-1 ¶ 60 (citing Doc. 68-11 ¶¶ 14, 16, 20)]. The Magistrate Judge found that the purported fact was immaterial, was contradicted by Brooks' testimony at oral argument which did not indicate that he asked to have another driver take the Ta Chen run, and that the Court had to infer that the conversation between Brooks and Murphy never occurred [Doc. 76 at 12 n.4].
Murphy indicated that Brooks was upset about being asked to make the Ta Chen run, and "complained that other drivers had gotten back before him and that one of them could have gone to make the stop" [Doc. 68-11 ¶¶ 14, 16]. Murphy further stated that Brooks did not mention his knee or safety as reasons he did not want to make the Ta Chen run [Id. ¶ 20]. "The only reasons [Brooks] stated to [Murphy] for not going were that he wanted to go to the store [*24]  regarding his cell phone and that he believed other drivers who had returned earlier that day could have gone in his place" [Id.]. Taking all the above in the light most favorable to Brooks, there is neither direct evidence nor a reasonable inference that Brooks asked that another driver be assigned the Ta Chen run.
3. Cat's Paw Theory
Under a cat's paw theory, "a non-decisionmaking employee's discriminatory animus may be imputed to a neutral decisionmaker when the decisionmaker has not independently investigated allegations of misconduct." Dwyer v. Ethan Allen Retail, Inc., 325 F. App'x 755, 757 (11th Cir. 2009) (citing Llampallas v. Mini-Circuits, Lab, Inc., 163 F.3d 1236, 1249 (11th Cir. 1998)). However, "[w]here a decisionmaker conducts his own evaluation and makes an independent decision, his decision is free of the taint of a biased subordinate employee." Pennington v. City of Huntsville, 261 F.3d 1262, 1270 (11th Cir. 2001).
Here, Brooks alleged that Murphy, who knew of Brooks' knee condition and upcoming FMLA leave, "had reasons to harbor animus toward Brooks" [Doc. 67 at 10]. As a result, Brooks alleged, Murphy lied to Dyon about Brooks' reasons for refusing the Ta Chen load, and Dyon relied on Murphy's statement in firing Brooks [Id.]. The Magistrate Judge found that this theory failed because there was no evidence that Murphy harbored animus toward Brooks, and because Dyon independently investigated [*25]  Brooks' refusal to take the Ta Chen load, and independently decided to fire Brooks [Doc. 76 at 33-35].
Brooks' cat's paw theory fails for two reasons. First, consistent with the finding regarding Brooks' set up theory, there is no evidence that Murphy harbored animus towards Brooks. At oral argument, Brooks argued that Murphy's animus was reflected in the way Murphy minimized Brooks' knee condition [Doc. 76 at 34]. Murphy's declaration indicated, however, that he knew of Brooks' knee pain, and on one occasion around late April 2015, Murphy approved Brooks' request to go home due to knee pain [Doc. 60-14 ¶ 21].
Further, Brooks did not dispute that Gibson and Dyon independently met with him on May 22, 2015 to discuss Brooks' refusal to take the Ta Chen load the previous day [Doc. 68 ¶ 89; see also Doc. 60-13 ¶ 15, Doc. 60-11 ¶ 13]. The parties dispute the content of that discussion [Doc. 68 ¶ 90]. Phoenix Metals alleged that Brooks said, he refused, the Ta Chen load so he could buy a cell phone; Brooks alleged that he told Dyon he could not take the load because he was out of hours [Id.]. Brooks also alleged that when he told Dyon he was out of hours, Dyon said that wasn't an excuse, and [*26]  he didn't want to hear it [Doc. 67-1 ¶ 75 (citing Doc. 67-10 at 75)]. Taken in the light most favorable to Brooks, this evidence shows that Brooks said he refused the Ta Chen load because he was out of hours, and Dyon said that wasn't an excuse and he didn't want to hear it. In fact, Brooks had almost two hours left when he logged out on May 21. The evidence also shows that Dyon did, in fact, conduct an independent investigation. For those reasons, Brooks' cat's paw theory fails.

4. Phoenix Metals' Previous Accommodation of Brooks
Brooks argues that the Magistrate Judge erred, in finding that Phoenix Metals' unwillingness to accommodate Brooks on May 21 when they had previously done so was not evidence of FMLA discrimination [Doc. 78 at 10-13]. As discussed above, there is neither evidence nor a reasonable inference that Brooks asked to be accommodated on May 21. For that reason, Brooks' argument fails. 5. Phoenix Metals' Accommodation of Other Drivers
Brooks also argues that the Magistrate Judge erred Joy not considering Phoenix Metals history of accommodating other drivers as evidence that Brooks' termination was pretextual [Doc. 78 at 10-11]. Because there is neither evidence nor a [*27]  reasonable inference that Brooks asked to be accommodated, Phoenix Metals previous accommodation of other drivers is not evidence that Brooks' termination was pretextual. Accordingly, Brooks argument on this point fails.

6. Denying Brooks' Motion for Sanctions
Brooks argues that it could be inferred, that he requested that another driver be assigned the May 21 Ta Chen load [Doc. 78 at 11]. Thus, he argues, the availability of other drivers to make the Ta Chen run is material and relevant, and the Magistrate Judge erred in denying Brooks' Motion for Sanctions [Id. at 11-12]. Because, as noted above, Brooks has not shown that he requested the Ta Chen load be assigned to another driver, this argument fails.
For the reasons stated above, Brooks' objections to the Magistrate Judge's recommendation to grant Phoenix Metals' Motion for Summary Judgment are OVERRULED. Additionally, Brooks' objection to the Magistrate Judge denying Brooks' Motion for Sanctions is OVERRULED.

IV. Conclusion
For the reasons stated above, Brooks' Objections to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation [Doc. 78] are OVERRULED. Further, the Court finds no clear error in the Report and Recommendation [Doc. 75]. Accordingly, [*28]  Magistrate Judge Larkins' Report and Recommendation [Doc. 76], which denies Brooks' Motion for Sanctions and Attorneys' Fees, denies a request by Phoenix Metals for attorneys' fees, and recommends granting summary judgment to Defendant Phoenix Metals is ADOPTED IN FULL.
The Clerk is DIRECTED to enter judgment for Defendants Phoenix Metals Company and Phoenix Corporation.
SO ORDERED, this 28 day of June, 2017.
