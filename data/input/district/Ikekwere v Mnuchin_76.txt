ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
The matter before the Court is Defendant Steven Mnuchin's1 ("Defendant"), Secretary of the Department of the Treasury ("the Department"), Motion for Summary Judgment. (Dkt. # 27.) Pursuant to Local Rule CV-7(h), the Court finds this matter suitable for disposition without a hearing.
After careful consideration of the memoranda in support of and in opposition to the motion, and in light of the parties' arguments at the hearing, the Court, for the reasons that follow, GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 27).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On June 22, 2009, Plaintiff Charles I. Ikekwere ("Plaintiff") was hired by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") as a GS-9 Revenue Agent in Austin, Texas. (Dkt. # 1 at 3.) According to Plaintiff, he is a black male from the country of Nigeria. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that he began his employment training with the IRS on [*2]  June 23, 2009, and some of his classmates in the training class included another black male, Anthony Allen, and a white male, Jason Cowdin. (Id.) During his employment, he was supervised at various times by Michael Simmons, Ken Shaw, and Debbie Doyle. (Id.)
Plaintiff contends that prior to his employment with the IRS, he had been diagnosed with major depression and panic disorder. (Dkt. # 1 at 4.) Soon after his employment began in 2009, Plaintiff alleges that he presented his medical documentation to Debbie Williams, an instructor at the IRS, who subsequently informed Mr. Shaw about Plaintiff's medical condition. (Id.) In December 2009, Plaintiff asserts that he requested a reasonable accommodation for his mental disability after he received a letter from his treating physician recommending that he be placed in a secluded area to perform his work, be given headphones to suppress noise, and be given additional time to complete assignments. (Id.) According to Plaintiff, Mr. Shaw denied his request for this accommodation and required Plaintiff to provide supplemental medical documentation. (Id.)
On February 18, 2010, Plaintiff alleges that the IRS building that he worked in was hit by [*3]  a small plane, destroying his computer and all of his work records. (Dkt. # 1 at 4.) According to Plaintiff, this incident worsened his medical condition and he sought medical treatment for nightmares and traumatic stress disorder. (Id.)
According to Defendant, during Plaintiff's employment with the IRS, he received continuous criticism for his poor performance. (Dkt. # 27 at 4.) Defendant contends that it spent months trying to ensure that Plaintiff had fair opportunities to succeed in his position, but that on June 28, 2010, after a year of poor performance and six months before his eventual termination, Mr. Shaw rated Plaintiff's performance as "unacceptable" and with "fails" ratings on five performance aspects. (Id.) Defendant alleges that Mr. Shaw told Plaintiff that he would be terminated from employment due to his poor performance. (Id.) However, Plaintiff contends that Mr. Shaw informed him that he would either need to resign or be terminated. (Dkt. # 1 at 4.) Plaintiff refused to resign but, the same day, Mr. Shaw called Plaintiff in from a field audit to have him turn in his computer, case files, credit card, and pocket commission. (Id.)
Immediately following his meeting with [*4]  Mr. Shaw on June 28, 2010, Plaintiff went to the Equal Employment Office ("EEO") to speak with a counselor concerning the events that had transpired. (Dkt. # 1 at 4; Dkt. # 27-1 at 36, 164.) Following his meeting with the EEO counselor, the IRS suspended its decision to terminate Plaintiff. (Dkt. # 27 at 4.) Plaintiff thereafter provided Mr. Shaw with a Request for Reasonable Accommodation Form, stating that he needed "environment and extra time and concentration to function." (Dkt. # 27-1 at 36.) On September 28, 2010, in response to his request, Plaintiff was provided with noise reduction headphones and was also allowed to move to a cubicle with less foot traffic. (Id.)
In August 2010, Plaintiff asserts that he found out that his training classmates, Mr. Allen and Mr. Cowdin, received pay grade increases, but that he was denied his increase to a GS-11. (Dkt. # 1 at 5.) Plaintiff contends that he went back to the EEO counselor in August 2010 because he was told at his initial EEO meeting in June 2010, to come back "if management did not follow up on [his] promotion from GS-9 to GS-11." (Dkt. # 27-1 at 164.)
On September 25, 2010, subsequent to his second EEO contact, Plaintiff contends [*5]  that in a meeting with the Acting Territory Manager Michael Simmons and Ms. Doyle, Plaintiff discussed his most recent EEO contact. (Dkt. # 1 at 5.) Plaintiff also asserts that he discussed his contact with the EEO with Mr. Shaw. (Id.) On September 29, 2010, according to Plaintiff, the IRS transferred him from the group managed by Mr. Shaw, to the group managed by Ms. Doyle. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that on the same day, Ms. Doyle transferred some of his fraud cases to a white male colleague, David Resis. (Id.) Plaintiff also contends that Ms. Doyle informed him that if he had questions, they should be directed to Sam Houston, a white male colleague, and not Mr. Allen, a black male colleague. (Id.)
Plaintiff alleges that he was preparing to go on vacation in Nigeria from November 5, 2010, until November 18, 2010. (Dkt. # 1 at 5.) According to Plaintiff, the day before his vacation, on November 4, 2010, Mr. Houston overheard Plaintiff and an Egyptian colleague discussing their travel plans at work and that Mr. Houston commented to them both that "I hope you people are not going to an Al Quaeda camp," and then walked away. (Id.) Plaintiff reported the comment to Ms. Doyle, but did not [*6]  reach out again to the EEO concerning this incident. (Id.) Plaintiff contends that he is not aware that Ms. Doyle took any action in response. (Id. at 5-6.) After he returned from his trip, Plaintiff contends that he completed all of his assignments without any negative feedback. (Id. at 6.)
According to Defendant, however, despite the accommodations made for Plaintiff's disability, his work performance did not improve; in November 2010, Ms. Doyle gave Plaintiff a mid-year performance rating with an overall rating of "unacceptable" and a "fails" rating on five different performance aspects. (Dkt. # 27 at 5; Dkt. # 27-2 at 124.) Defendant contends that around this same time, Plaintiff began to complain that the accommodations the IRS made for him were unacceptable. (Id.) Defendant also asserts that after Plaintiff informed Ms. Doyle of Mr. Houston's comment, Ms. Doyle spoke to Mr. Houston and told him that such comments are inappropriate and should not be made in the workplace. (Id.)
According to Plaintiff, on January 5, 2011, Ms. Doyle told Plaintiff to report to her office the next day. (Dkt. # 1 at 6.) On January 6, 2011, Plaintiff reported to Ms. Doyle's office and thereafter began a conference call [*7]  with Mr. Simmons; Plaintiff was informed that he would not be going on a training trip because of his poor performance. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that he informed Mr. Simmons of the recent case closings he had worked on and that Mr. Simmons was not aware of these closings and asked to see his work in a meeting set up for January 11, 2011. (Id.) However, according to Plaintiff, during the January 6 meeting, Plaintiff "could not contain himself and began to cry loudly, asking 'Why are you doing this to me?,'" and that his crying was loud enough to be heard by other employees. (Id.) On January 11, 2011, Plaintiff was presented with a termination letter citing various performance problems as the basis for the termination, along with his "loud and unprofessional" actions during the January 6 meeting. (Id.)

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On November 30, 2010, Plaintiff's EEO counselor issued a "Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint Under 29 C.F.R. Part 1614." (Dkt. # 27-1 at 92-93.) The purpose of the Notice was to inform Plaintiff that he was entitled to file a discrimination complaint "because the matter(s) [Plaintiff] brought to [her] attention has/have not been resolved to [Plaintiff's] satisfaction." [*8]  (Id. at 92.) The Notice advised Plaintiff that if he wished to file such a complaint, he had to do so "in writing, signed, and filed, in person or by mail within 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE." (Id. (emphasis in original).)
On December 22, 2010, Plaintiff filed his "Individual Complaint of Employment Discrimination with the Department of the Treasury." (Dkt. # 27-1 at 83.) Plaintiff's Complaint listed discrimination on the basis of his race, national origin, physical/mental disability, and retaliation for prior EEO activity occurring on December 12, 2009. (Id. at 84.) After the Department conducted a formal investigation (id. at 57), Plaintiff filed charges against Defendant with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") (see id. at 29).
On July 25, 2012, an EEOC Administrative Judge issued a Decision Without a Hearing, determining that Plaintiff (1) failed to establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment based on his race or national origin, disability, or reprisal for an EEO activity; (2) could not make a showing of discrimination based on disparate treatment; and (3) could not prevail on his failure to accommodate claim because he could not make a showing that he was a qualified [*9]  individual. (Dkt. # 27-1 at 29-53.) On August 8, 2012, the Department issued its Final Agency Decision ("FAD"), finding that it would fully implement the EEOC Administrative Judge's finding of no discrimination. (Id. at 17-18.)
On September 21, 2012, following receipt of the FAD, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal with the Office of Federal Operation ("OFO") of the EEOC. (Dkt. # 39-1 at 2.) On July 25, 2014, the OFO issued a decision affirming the Agency's FAD. (Id. at 7.) The OFO denied Plaintiff's request for reconsideration on February 12, 2015. (Id. at 20.) The denial of the reconsideration indicated that Plaintiff could file a civil action in an appropriate United States District Court within 90 days of the date that Plaintiff received the decision on reconsideration. (Id. at 22.) Plaintiff received notice of the decision on February 17, 2015. (Id. at 25.)
Plaintiff timely filed a complaint in this Court against Defendant on May 18, 2015.2 (Dkt. # 1.) Plaintiff alleges claims against Defendant for race discrimination under Title VII, disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, and for retaliation under both Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. (Id.) On October 7, 2016, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment [*10]  on all of Plaintiff's claims. (Dkt. # 27.) Plaintiff filed a response in opposition on November 3, 2016 (Dkt. # 35); Defendant filed a reply on November 9, 2016 (Dkt. # 36.) The motion is discussed below.

LEGAL STANDARD
A movant is entitled to summary judgment upon showing that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Meadaa v. K.A.P. Enters., L.L.C., 756 F.3d 875, 880 (5th Cir. 2014). A dispute is only genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the moving party meets this burden, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts that establish the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Distribuidora Mari Jose, S.A. de C.V. v. Transmaritime, Inc., 738 F.3d 703, 706 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Allen v. Rapides Parish Sch. Bd., 204 F.3d 619, 621 (5th Cir. 2000)). "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Hillman v. Loga, 697 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)).
In deciding whether a fact issue has been created, the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it "may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence." Tiblier v. Dlabal, 743 F.3d 1004, 1007 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000)). However, "[u]nsubstantiated assertions, improbable inferences, and unsupported [*11]  speculation are not sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment." United States v. Renda Marine, Inc., 667 F.3d 651, 655 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Brown v. City of Hous., 337 F.3d 539, 541 (5th Cir. 2003)).

ANALYSIS
Defendant moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims. Defendant first argues that Plaintiff did not timely file his complaint of discrimination with the EEO. (Dkt. # 27 at 6.) Defendant also contends that Plaintiff lacks sufficient evidence for his claims under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. (Id. at 9.)
A. 15-Day Deadline to File a Formal Complaint
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff failed to timely exhaust his administrative remedies when he missed his 15-day deadline to file his individual complaint of employment discrimination with the Department of the Treasury. (Dkt. # 27 at 8.) According to Defendant, a Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint under 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 was issued to Plaintiff on November 30, 2010, but Plaintiff did not file his complaint with the Department of Treasury until December 22, 2010, at the earliest. (Id.) Because Plaintiff missed the 15-day deadline by at least a week, Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his remedies and his claims should be dismissed. (Id.) Plaintiff did not respond to this argument in his response to the motion for summary judgment. [*12]  (See Dkt. # 35.)
The exhaustion of administrative remedies is a prerequisite to filing suit under Title VII. See Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 378-79 (5th Cir. 2002). In order for a federal-employee plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies, a federal-employee-plaintiff must first comply with the EEO regulations as set forth in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105, et seq.
To begin, federal employees must "initiate contact with [an EEO] counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory, or in the case of personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action." 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1). After an employee initiates contact with an EEO Counselor, the EEO Counselor has thirty days to conduct an interview with the employee. Id. § 1614.105(d). If the matter has not been resolved by the Counselor, aggrieved employee, and employer, the Counselor shall inform the aggrieved person in writing of the right to file a discrimination complaint, not later than the thirtieth day after contacting the Counselor. Id. "The notice shall inform the complainant of the right to file a discrimination complaint within 15 days of receipt of the notice . . . ." Id. "A complaint must be filed within 15 days of receipt of the notice . . . ." 29 C.F.R. § 1614.106(b). If the employee fails to file his or her formal complaint [*13]  within this fifteen-day period, the agency may dismiss the action. 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(2).
Here, the record demonstrates that Plaintiff was sent a Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint Under 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (the "Notice"). (Dkt. # 27-1 at 92.) The Notice, dated November 30, 2010, informed Plaintiff that he had 15 calendar days after receipt of the Notice to file a formal complaint of discrimination. (Id.) Plaintiff's Individual Complaint of Employment Discrimination with the Department of Treasury was signed on December 22, 2010, and filed by the Department of Treasury on December 27, 2010. (Id. at 83, 95.) Accordingly, the pertinent issue before this Court is when Plaintiff received the Notice, which would trigger the 15-day deadline to file a formal complaint.
Defendant, however, fails to include any evidence as to when Plaintiff received the Notice to support its allegation that Plaintiff failed to timely file his formal complaint with the Department of Treasury within the 15-day deadline after receiving the Notice. And, by Plaintiff's failure to respond to this argument in his response to the summary judgment motion, Plaintiff has also not included any evidence in opposition. Accordingly, because it is unclear from [*14]  the record when Plaintiff received the Notice of his right to file a formal complaint, triggering the 15-day deadline, the Court cannot grant summary judgment on this basis.3
B. Contact with EEO Counselor
Defendant next contends that the Court cannot consider any agency action that Plaintiff complains of that occurred prior to 45 days before his initial contact with an EEO counselor. (Dkt. # 27 at 8.) Before filing a formal complaint, an applicant for federal employment who believes he has been the victim of discrimination "must consult a Counselor prior to filing a complaint in order to try to informally resolve the matter." 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a). The applicant "must initiate contact with a Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory." Id. § 1614.105(a)(1).
The record indicates that Plaintiff's first contact with an EEO counselor occurred on June 28, 2010. (Dkt. # 27-1 at 36.) Therefore, any conduct that Plaintiff complains of must have occurred within the 45 days prior to his contact with the EEO counselor, or between May 14, 2010, and June 28, 2010. Because there does not appear to be any dispute regarding this assertion by Defendant, the Court will only consider agency action that Plaintiff [*15]  complains of occurring on or after May 14, 2010, in the analysis of his claims below.
C. Title VII Claims
Defendant moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims under Title VII. (Dkt. # 27 at 9.)
1. Failure to Promote
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff cannot overcome summary judgment on any failure to promote claim. (Id.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of failure to promote because it was well-documented that he was not promoted from a GS-9 to a GS-11 because he was failing in his work. (Id.)
Title VII prohibits an employer from failing to promote an employee on the basis of his race. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Because Plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence to support his claim, he must proceed under the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting framework. See, e.g., Autry v. Fort Bend Indep. Sch. Dist., 704 F.3d 344, 346-47 (5th Cir. 2013). To challenge a failure to promote, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination, demonstrating that (1) he was not promoted, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought, (3) he fell within a protected class at the time of the failure to promote, and (4) the defendant either gave the promotion to someone outside of the protected class or otherwise failed to promote the plaintiff [*16]  because of his race. Id. (citing Price v. Fed. Express Corp., 283 F.3d 715, 720 (5th Cir. 2002)).
If the plaintiff can make out a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action taken against the plaintiff. St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506-07, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993). The defendant's burden is one of production, not proof, and involves no credibility assessments. See, e.g., West v. Nabors Drilling USA, Inc., 330 F.3d 379, 385 (5th Cir. 2003). This "burden requires the production of admissible evidence in support of its nondiscriminatory reasons." Hervey v. Miss. Dep't of Educ., 404 F. App'x 865, 868 (5th Cir. 2010) (per curiam).
Last, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to make an ultimate showing of intentional discrimination. Reed v. Neopost USA, Inc., 701 F.3d 434, 439 (5th Cir. 2012). The plaintiff must "prove either that [the defendant's] articulated reason is merely pretext for race discrimination (the pretext alternative), or that [the defendant's] reason, while true, is only one of the reasons for its decision, and another 'motivating factor' is [the plaintiff's] protected characteristic (the mixed-motives alternative)." Autry, 704 F.3d at 347.
Here, Defendant challenges two elements of Plaintiff's prima facie case of failure to promote: (1) that Plaintiff was qualified for the promotion, and (2) that his promotion was given to someone outside of his protected class, or that he was not promoted because of his race. (Dkt. # 27 [*17]  at 10.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot produce sufficient evidence to overcome summary judgment on either of these elements. (Id.)
i. Whether Plaintiff was Qualified
Defendant argues that Plaintiff was not qualified for the grade increase he desired because his most recent performance rating would have to have been at least "fully successful." (Dkt. # 27 at 10.) Therefore, Defendant contends that because Plaintiff's 2010 appraisal rating was "fails," he was denied the grade increase from a GS-9 to a GS-11. (Id.)
In response to Defendant's motion, Plaintiff fails to produce any evidence that he, himself, was qualified for the pay grade increase. (Dkt. # 35 at 2-3.) He does not dispute that he received a "fails" rating on his performance evaluation. (See id.) Instead, Plaintiff argues that others in his training class, including Mr. Cowdin, a white male, experienced a drop in performance, but still received the pay grade promotion. (Id.) While this may be evidence in support of other elements of a prima facie case of failure to promote, it does not satisfy the element of whether Plaintiff was qualified for the pay increase.
ii. Whether Race Motivated Defendant's Decision
Even if Plaintiff [*18]  had sufficient evidence that he was qualified for the pay grade increase, he cannot overcome summary judgment that race was not a motivation in Defendant's denial of the promotion. Defendant asserts that receiving the pay grade increase was available to each individual employee and that it was not a competitive promotion. (Dkt. # 27 at 11.) Defendant also argues that Plaintiff cannot provide any evidence that the decision to deny him the pay increase was based on his race. (Id.)
Plaintiff, as discussed above, argues that a white, male employee, Mr. Cowdin, received the pay grade increase in spite of his need for a "maximum level of supervision." (Dkt. 35 at 2.) As evidence, Plaintiff includes two of Mr. Cowdin's "Basic Training Recommendation" forms, one from April 2010, and one from October 2010. (Dkt. # 35-4 at 2-3.) The April form indicates that Mr. Cowdin needs only "average supervision" because he is not "fully trained," but that overall Mr. Cowdin's work had been "businesslike and professional." (Id. at 2.) The April form also indicates that Mr. Cowdin had met his training objectives for the portion of training evaluated at that time. (Id.) The October form indicates that Mr. Cowdin had [*19]  again "met the objectives of this portion of training and that he is recommended to the next training segment," but that his "work indicates further improvement is needed; therefore, he [was] recommended for maximum supervision." (Id. at 3.)
Despite Plaintiff's contention regarding Mr. Cowdin, Plaintiff's own "Basic Training Recommendation" forms are not nearly the same performance level rating as Mr. Cowdin. (See Dkt. # 35-5 at 2-3.) Plaintiff included his own two forms-one from July 2010, and one from September 2010. (Id.) The July form recommends maximum level of supervision because he did not pass the objectives of that portion of training that was being evaluated during that time. (Id. at 2.) The September form also recommends maximum supervision because although his training objectives were met for that period, his performance was in need of improvement. (Id. at 3.) Plaintiff's form indicates that he was also having problems with time management. (Id.) Because Mr. Cowdin's two forms indicate that he had met his training objectives both times, and Plaintiff's forms indicate that he did not meet the training objectives both times, the Court finds this is not sufficient evidence that Defendant's denial [*20]  of the pay grade increase was motivated by Plaintiff's race.
Additionally, while both Mr. Cowdin and Plaintiff were recommended for maximum supervision on at least one of their forms, there is no evidence that a certain level of supervision, or the lack thereof, was an element in Defendant's decision to promote an employee from a GS-9 to a GS-11. Instead, Defendant has produced evidence that an employee would not receive a pay grade promotion unless his or her most recent performance rating was "fully successful." (Dkt. # 27-1 at 10.)
Plaintiff also alleges conduct from Mr. Shaw in April 2010 concerning Plaintiff's native language is evidence that the denial of his pay grade promotion was motivated by Plaintiff's race. (Dkt. # 35 at 3.) However, as discussed earlier, the Court may only consider conduct occurring on or after May 14, 2010, which would be within the 45 days before Plaintiff initially spoke to an EEO counselor. See id. § 1614.105(a)(1).
On this record, Plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case of failure to promote based on his race. The Court will grant summary judgment in favor of Defendant for this claim.
2. Discriminatory Discharge
Defendant also moves for summary judgment on [*21]  Plaintiff's claim of discriminatory discharge. (Dkt. # 27 at 12.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge because the decision to terminate Plaintiff was well-documented at the time of his termination. (Id.)
To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that (1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) he was discharged, (3) he was qualified for the position, and (4) he was replaced by someone outside of the protected class or that similarly situated persons outside of the class were treated more favorably than he. Willis v. Cleco Corp., 749 F.3d 314, 320 (5th Cir. 2014). Defendant disputes only the last two elements.
i. Whether Plaintiff was Qualified
As discussed above for his failure to promote claim, Plaintiff has not produced sufficient evidence that he was qualified for his position with the IRS. (See Dkt. # 35.) Instead, it is undisputed that Plaintiff received a "fails" rating on his November 2010 appraisal. (Dkt. # 35 at 2-3; see Dkt. # 27-2 at 124.) Thus, there does not appear to be a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Plaintiff was qualified for the position other than Plaintiff's own personal opinion.
ii. [*22]  Similarly Situated Employee
Even if Plaintiff was qualified for his position, he cannot make out a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge because he has not produced sufficient evidence that he was treated less favorably than a similarly situated employee. As a comparator, Plaintiff uses a white employee, Mr. Cowdin, who he claims was treated differently than himself even though Mr. Cowdin "did not know how to issue IDR, before an audit." (Dkt. # 35-2 at 20.) Plaintiff's own declaration in support of this assertion does not sufficiently support any contention that Plaintiff and Mr. Cowdin were "similarly situated" and that Mr. Cowdin received favorable treatment compared to Plaintiff. See VRV Dev. L.P. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., 630 F.3d 451, 455 (5th Cir. 2011) ("[A] party cannot defeat summary judgment with conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated assertions."). Instead, the Court has already noted the performance differences between Mr. Cowdin and Plaintiff, as detailed in their "Basic Training Recommendation" forms. (Compare Dkt. # 35-4 at 2-3, with Dkt. # 35-3 at 2-3.) Additionally, the fact that Mr. Cowdin was also recommended for maximum supervision at one point does not suggest he was treated more favorably than Plaintiff . (See Dkt. # 35-4 [*23]  at 2-3; Dkt. # 35-3 at 2-3.) On this record, Plaintiff has failed to provide any other evidence which would create a dispute of material fact that Mr. Cowdin was similarly situated and received more favorable treatment for the purpose of establishing a prima facie case that he was discharged on account of his race and/or national origin. Summary judgment is granted in favor of Defendant for this claim.
3. Hostile Work Environment
Defendant moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim. (Dkt. # 27 at 14.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff has no evidence of any racial or national origin animus and that any claimed harassment was neither severe nor pervasive. (Id. at 14-19.) Additionally, Defendant argues that a comment by Defendant's coworker concerning his national origin was dealt with by management in an effective manner. (Id. at 19.)
To establish a claim for a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must show (1) he belongs to a protected group; (2) he was subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment complained of was based on race or national origin; (4) the harassment complained of affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) the employer knew or should [*24]  have known of the harassment in question and failed to take proper remedial action. Williams-Boldwar v. Denton Cnty., Tex., 741 F.3d 635, 640 (5th Cir. 2014).
In the context of a hostile work environment claim, "harassment is based on race if the complained-of conduct had a racial character or purpose." Jones v. Dallas Cnty., 47 F. Supp. 3d 469, 483 (N.D. Tex. 2014). A plaintiff "must demonstrate a connection between the allegedly harassing incidents and their protected status." Id.; see also Raj v. La. State Univ., 714 F.3d 322, 331 (5th Cir. 2013). For harassment to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to affect a term, condition, or privilege of employment, the environment must be deemed "both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one that the victim did perceive to be so." Aryain, 534 F.3d at 479 (quoting Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 786, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998)). Under the totality of the circumstances approach, a single incident of harassment, if extremely severe, could create a viable Title VII claim. However, a claim could also be founded on a continuous pattern of less severe incidents. EEOC v. WC&M Enters., 496 F.3d 393, 400 (5th Cir. 2007).
Plaintiff cites a number of instances which he contends demonstrate that Defendant discriminated against him based on his race and national origin. (Dkt. # 35 at 3-4.) Because the Court cannot consider any event prior to May 14, 2010, the Court will only consider Plaintiff's allegations that: (1) [*25]  on June 28, 2010, he was told that he was going to be terminated by Mr. Shaw and that Mr. Shaw "harassed [him] to return IRS property"; (2) in November 2010, all of his job assignments were removed by Ms. Doyle; and (3) on November 4, 2010, his co-worker Sam Houston told him "I hope you are not going to the Al Qaeda camp." (Dkt. # 35 at 4.) As for these events, Plaintiff admits that in isolation, "there was no one incident that, in and of itself, constituted a hostile work environment, [but that] all the incidents taken together over a several months' period did constitute a hostile work environment." (Id. at 7-8.)
The Court finds that Plaintiff has not produced sufficient evidence to overcome summary judgment that the incident and remarks he complains of were isolated incidents and not a continuous pattern of harassment, if any. Thus, they appear to be single, isolated events, and were not physically threatening or humiliating. See Royal v. CCC&R Tres Arboles, L.L.C., 736 F.3d 396, 401 (5th Cir. 2013) (stating factors courts must consider in determining if work environment is sufficiently abusive or hostile). Plaintiff has additionally cited no evidence that they were so severe as to affect a term or condition of his employment. Cf. Walker v. Thompson, 214 F.3d 615, 626 (5th Cir. 2000) (finding a fact issue as to [*26]  whether harassment was severe or pervasive when, over a period of three years, plaintiffs were subject to "comparisons to slaves and monkeys, derisive remarks regarding their African heritage, patently offensive remarks regarding the hair of African-Americans, and conversations in which a co-worker and supervisor used the word nigger"). Indeed, the incidents alleged by Plaintiff are relatively mild compared to other cases where far more frequent statements have been made, but have been held not to rise to the level needed to establish a hostile work environment. See, e.g., id.; Vaughn v. Pool Offshore Co., 683 F.2d 922 (5th Cir. 1982) (no hostile work environment where plaintiff directly called racial epithets by coworkers); Grant v. UOP, Inc., 972 F. Supp. 1042 (W.D. La. 1996), aff'd, 122 F.3d 1066 (5th Cir. 1997) (five separate utterances of the word 'nigger' directly to plaintiff were insufficient to establish a hostile work environment claim); Smith v. Beverly Health and Rehabilitation Serv., Inc., 978 F. Supp. 1116 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (holding that a several utterances of racial epithets by a supervisor were insufficient to support hostile work environment claim); McCray v. DPC Indus., Inc., 942 F. Supp. 288 (E.D. Tex. 1996) (holding that five uses of the terms 'black Yankee' and 'son,' two racial jokes, and the use of the word 'nigger' were insufficient to establish a hostile work environment claim). Thus, the Court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude that [*27]  Plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment and summary judgment is granted on this claim.4
D. Rehabilitation Claims
Defendant moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims under the Rehabilitation Act. (Dkt. # 27 at 19.)
1. Failure to Accommodate
Defendant first moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim under the Rehabilitation Act ("RA") for failure to accommodate. (Dkt. # 27 at 19.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that he was qualified for his position as a Revenue Agent. (Id.)
The RA was enacted "to ensure that handicapped individuals are not denied jobs or other benefits because of prejudiced attitudes or ignorance of others." Brennan v. Stewart, 834 F.2d 1248, 1259 (5th Cir. 1988). A plaintiff asserting a private cause of action for violations of the RA may only recover compensatory damages upon a showing of intentional discrimination. Carter v. Orleans Parish Pub. Sch., 725 F.2d 261, 264 (5th Cir. 1984).
To state a prima facie case under the RA for failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must allege: "(1) that he is a qualified individual within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA")5; (2) that he is being excluded from participation in, or being denied benefits of, services, programs, or activities for which the public entity is responsible, [*28]  or is otherwise discriminated against by the public entity; and (3) that such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination is by reason of his disability." Melton v. Dall. Area Rapid Transit, 391 F.3d 669, 671 (5th Cir. 2004); see 42 U.S.C. § 12132.
"The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of [the RA], consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
In determining whether a person is "qualified," the court examines "(1) whether the individual meets the necessary prerequisites for the job, such as education, experience, skills and the like; and (2) whether the individual can perform the essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodation." Foreman v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 117 F.3d 800, 810 n.14 (5th Cir. 1997) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m)). Therefore, to avoid summary judgment the plaintiff must demonstrate "that he could either (1) 'perform the essential functions of the job in spite of [his] disability,' [*29]  or (2) that 'a reasonable accommodation of [his] disability would have enabled [him] to perform the essential functions of his job.'" Cannon v. Jacobs Field Servs. N.A., Inc., 813 F.3d 586, 592 (5th Cir. 2016) (alterations in original) (quoting EEOC v. LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 697 (5th Cir. 2014)). A function is "essential" if it bears "more than a marginal relationship" to the employee's job. Chandler v. City of Dall., 2 F.3d 1385, 1393 (5th Cir. 1993), holding modified on other grounds as discussed in Kapche v. City of San Antonio, 304 F.3d 493 (5th Cir. 2002) (per curiam).
Only if the court determines that the plaintiff cannot perform the essential functions of the job does the court consider whether a reasonable accommodation by the employer would enable him to perform those functions. Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1393-94. The ADA requires that the employer and employee engage in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation. EEOC v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., LP, 570 F.3d 606, 622 (5th Cir. 2009). The ADA defines "reasonable accommodations" to include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). However, the ADA does not require an employer to transfer from the disabled employee any of the essential functions [*30]  of his job in order to make reasonable accommodation for his disability. Barber v. Nabors Drilling, USA, Inc., 130 F.3d 702, 709 (5th Cir. 1997).
Here, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that he was a qualified individual. (Dkt. # 27 at 20.) Defendant cites evidence of Plaintiff's poor performance evaluations and Plaintiff's inability to effectively and clearly communicate in writing, which it contends are required elements for employment as a Revenue Agent. (Dkt. # 27-1 at 8, 32, 33.) Defendant argues that it identified Plaintiff's communication deficiencies early on in his employment, and that even after attempting to accommodate his mental disabilities by giving Plaintiff head phones and moving him to an office with less foot traffic, Plaintiff's work still did not improve. (Dkt. # 27 at 20; Dkt. # 27-1 at 8-9, 13-14, 15-16.) Because Plaintiff could not perform this essential function of his job—he could not clearly and effectively communicate in writing—Defendant contends that Plaintiff was not a qualified individual under the RA. (Dkt. # 27 at 20.)
Plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that he could perform the essential elements of his job with or without any accommodation, but that "after he was given the reasonable accommodation [*31]  of the noise-suppressing head phones, [he] could complete his jobs faster, with fewer errors and close out his cases." (Dkt. # 35 at 10.) Plaintiff complains however that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate his mental disability when it waited over six months to accommodate his request for a quieter, more secluded place to work. (Id. at 12.)
In support of his contention, Plaintiff does not provide any evidence, aside from his own statement in his declaration, that he could satisfactorily communicate tax laws in writing, an apparently undisputed essential element of his job. (See id.; Dkt. # 35-2 at 26.) Defendant, on the other hand, has produced evidence of several of Plaintiff's performance evaluations, which indicate that Plaintiff was having written communication problems throughout his employment with the IRS. (See, e.g., Dkt. # 27-2 at 125-26.) Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff could not perform an essential element of his job, and it must now determine whether Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation by Defendant would have afforded him the opportunity to do so.
As already noted, Plaintiff was given the accommodation of head phones, which Plaintiff contends improved [*32]  his work performance. (See Dkt. # 35 at 10.) Still, Plaintiff contends that he filled out a Reasonable Accommodation Request and requested that he be given a quieter space to work, but that management waited over six months to accommodate this request even though they had known about his disability for over one year. (Id. at 12-13.) Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's failure to accommodate his request "probably contributed to the exacerbation of his condition, contributed to Plaintiff's initial lack of success in performing his job, and constitutes a violation of the [RA]." (Id. at 14.)
As an initial matter, the Court notes that the record in this case does not support Plaintiff's alleged timeline of events. Instead, the record indicates that Plaintiff likely filled out his Reasonable Accommodation Request sometime after April 2010, and not on December 15, 2009, as Plaintiff suggests. (See Dkt. # 35-11.) While Plaintiff's signature indicates that he signed the form in December 2009, the bottom of the form indicates that the version of the form he was using was revised in April 2010. Additionally, the form bears a submission date to the IRS of June 29, 2010. (See id.) Thus, it appears the earliest date upon [*33]  which Plaintiff could have filled out this form would have been April 2010; accordingly, there does not appear to be support in the record for Plaintiff's assertion that Defendant waited over six months to accommodate his disability.
Still, even if Defendant waited over six months to accommodate Plaintiff's request, Defendant has produced evidence that Plaintiff's performance did not improve even when he was moved to an area in the office that was more secluded and had less foot traffic. (Dkt. # 27-1 at 8-9, 13-14, 15-16.) Plaintiff does not dispute that he was granted his accommodation request in September 2010. (Dkt. # 35 at 15.) However, Plaintiff's performance evaluation in which he received a "fails" rating in five key performance areas, including in his written communication skills, occurred on November 10, 2010—after the time he was granted his accommodation and moved to a more secluded work space with less foot traffic. (Dkt. # 27-1 at 8-9, 13-14, 15-16.)
Accordingly, on this record, Plaintiff has not presented competent summary judgment evidence sufficient to demonstrate that he was a qualified individual under the RA during his employment with the IRS. Plaintiff has not shown [*34]  that he could either perform the essential functions of his job in spite of his disability, or that a reasonable accommodation of his disability would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his job. See Cannon, 813 F.3d at 592. Because Plaintiff has failed to create a material fact question on an element of his prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the RA, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.
2. Discriminatory Discharge
Defendant also moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for discriminatory discharge under the RA. (Dkt. # 27 at 20.) Defendant contends again that Plaintiff cannot show he was qualified for his position. (Id. at 21.) Defendant also asserts that Plaintiff was terminated by the IRS for his poor performance and inappropriate behavior and for no other reason. (Id.)
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the RA, a plaintiff must show that he was (1) disabled within the meaning of the RA, (2) subjected to an adverse action 'solely by reason of [his] or his disability,' and (3) otherwise qualified for the program. Soledad v. U.S. Dep't of Treasury, 304 F.3d 500, 504-05 & n.7 (5th Cir. 2002).
Here, as discussed earlier, there is no genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff was not qualified for his job as a Revenue [*35]  Agent. Plaintiff was a not "qualified individual" for whom the RA would apply. Nor has Plaintiff produced sufficient evidence to overcome summary judgment that he was subject to termination "solely by reason of his disability." Instead, Defendant has produced evidence that Plaintiff was discharged on account of his poor performance. Summary judgment is granted for Plaintiff's discriminatory discharge claim under the RA.
E. Retaliation Claims
Finally, Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiff's retaliation claims under Title VII and the RA.6 (Dkt. # 27 at 21.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate any causal connection between his protected activity and any adverse action. (Id.)
To state a claim for retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in a statutorily protected conduct, (2) he suffered a materially adverse action, and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action. Jenkins v. City of San Antonio Fire Dep't, 784 F.3d 263, 269 (5th Cir. 2015) (citing Aryain v. Wal-Mart Stores Tex. LP, 534 F.3d 473, 484 (5th Cir. 2008)). Once a plaintiff has made a prima facie case, the employer must provide some "legitimate nondiscriminatory reason" for the adverse action taken. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). If the employer provides a nondiscriminatory reason, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff [*36]  to show a genuine issue of material fact that the employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reason is pretext for retaliation. See Alvarado v. Tex. Rangers, 492 F.3d 605, 611 (5th Cir. 2007).
1. Prima Facie Case
Defendant does not contest the first two elements of Plaintiff's prima facie case of retaliation. (See Dkt. # 27 at 21.) Indeed, the record indicates that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity when he consulted with an EEO counselor and filed an EEO complaint. Plaintiff also engaged in protected activity when he complained about Mr. Houston's comment to him regarding whether he was going to an "Al Quaeda camp." (Dkt. # 1 at 5.) Additionally, an adverse employment action occurred when (1) Plaintiff was denied his pay grade increase from a GS-9 to a GS-11, and (2) Plaintiff was terminated from employment.7 Instead, Defendant challenges the third element of Plaintiff's prima facie case, arguing that Plaintiff cannot produce evidence which demonstrates a causal connection between his protected activity and the adverse employment action. (Id. at 8.)
In order to establish a causal connection as required by the third prong of the prima facie case, a plaintiff does not have to prove that his protected activity was the sole factor motivating the employer's [*37]  challenged actions. Gee v. Principi, 289 F.3d 342, 345 (5th Cir. 2002). Close timing between the protected activity and the adverse action may provide the causal connection needed to make out a prima facie case of retaliation. McCoy v. City of Shreveport, 492 F.3d 551, 562 n.28 (5th Cir. 2007).
The evidence produced in this case establishes that Plaintiff first consulted an EEO counselor on June 28, 2010. (Dkt. # 27-1 at 36, 164.) Approximately two months later, in August 2010, Plaintiff found out that he was denied his pay grade increase from a GS-9 to a GS-11. (Dkt. # 1 at 5.) At this time, in August 2010, Plaintiff again consulted the EEO counselor. (Id.) Thereafter, three months later, on November 10, 2010, Plaintiff received a "fails" rating on his performance evaluation. (Dkt. # 27-2 at 124.) On December 3, 2010, Plaintiff complained about his co-workers comment regarding an "Al-Qaeda camp" to Ms. Doyle. (Dkt. # 1 at 5.) On December 22, 2010, Plaintiff filed his formal complaint of discrimination with the EEO. (Dkt. # 27-1 at 83.) A few weeks after both of these protected activities, on January 11, 2011, Plaintiff was terminated from employment with the IRS. (Dkt. # 1 at 6.)
On this record, the timing between Plaintiff's several contacts with the EEO counselor, his complaint to his supervisor [*38]  about his coworker's comment, and his filing of an EEO formal complaint is very close to Plaintiff's adverse employment actions. In fact, in all instances, the timing of the adverse actions against Plaintiff was less than three months. The Fifth Circuit has held that "a time lapse of up to four months" may be sufficiently close to establish a causal connection. Evans v. Houston, 246 F.3d 344, 354 (5th Cir. 2001). Still, temporal proximity between the protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action, by itself, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for the element of causation. Kopszywa v. Home Depot USA, Inc., 620 F. App'x 275, 280 (5th Cir. Aug. 11, 2015); DeHart v. Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc., 214 F. App'x 437, 443 (5th Cir. 2007). Temporal proximity should be weighed by the court "as part of the entire calculation of whether [the employee] has shown a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Hague v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr., 560 F. App'x 328, 334 n. 7 (5th Cir. 2014).
Noting that "the existence of a causal link between a protected activity and an adverse employment action is a 'highly fact specific' and difficult question," the Fifth Circuit has identified factors supporting causation including "(1) the employee's past disciplinary record, (2) whether the employer followed its typical policy and procedures in terminating the employee, and (3) the temporal proximity between the employee's [*39]  conduct and termination." Smith v. Xerox Corp., 371 F. App'x 514, 520 (5th Cir. 2010). Some cases have held that where only temporal proximity exists, to be adequate evidence of causality for a prima facie case, it must be very close. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001); Strong v. Univ. Healthcare Sys., LLC, 482 F.3d 802, 808 (5th Cir. 2007).
As previously discussed, Defendant has produced summary judgment evidence that Plaintiff's job performance, especially his written communication skills, had been lacking since nearly the beginning of his employment with the IRS. (See, e.g., Dkt. # 27 at 20; Dkt. # 27-1 at 8-9, 13-14, 15-16; Dkt. # 35-18.) Additionally, there is evidence that Defendant, on more than one occasion, attempted to accommodate Plaintiff's requests to accommodate his disability, but that Plaintiff's performance did not improve. (Dkt. # 27 at 20; Dkt. # 27-1 at 8-9, 13-14, 15-16.) Nevertheless, because the standard for satisfying the causation elements at the prima facie stage is "much less stringent" than the "but-for" causation that a jury must find, then Plaintiff has at least provided sufficient facts to create a genuine issue of material fact that his protected activities were causally connected to his adverse actions on the basis of close temporal proximity.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has, for purposes of summary judgment, met his [*40]  burden of demonstrating a prima facie case of retaliation, and the burden shifts to Defendant to offer some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action.
2. Legitimate, Non-Retaliatory Reason
Defendant has produced several legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for Plaintiff's termination. (Dkt. # 27 at 22-23.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff was terminated for his poor performance and inappropriate behavior in his January 6, 2011 meeting with Ms. Doyle and Mr. Simmons. (Id.) Because Defendant has offered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the adverse actions, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to show a genuine issue of material fact that the employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for discrimination. See Alvarado, 492 F.3d at 611.
3. Pretext
Unlike the causal connection element, the Fifth Circuit has held "temporal proximity alone is not sufficient to establish the 'but-for' causation in the pretext prong of the analysis." Wood v. Chertoff, 523 F. Supp. 2d 509, 523 (W.D. Tex. 2007) (citing Strong v. Univ. Healthcare Sys., L.L.C., 482 F.3d 802, 808 (5th Cir. 2007)); see also Nassar,570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. at 2534 (affirming the "but-for" causation standard for retaliation cases). Temporal proximity is still evidence of pretext, but it cannot alone show pretext because such a rule would "unnecessarily tie the hands of employers." Strong, 482 F.3d at 808 (citing [*41]  Breeden, 532 U.S. at 273). A plaintiff's own subjective belief that the employer's proffered reason is false is also not sufficient to establish an issue of material fact on pretext. See Shackelford v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, 190 F.3d 398, 408 (5th Cir. 1999). A plaintiff must provide specific evidence "which could support a finding that [h]e would not have [experienced an adverse employment action] in the absence of h[is] having engaged in protected conduct." Id. at 408-09. In other words, a plaintiff must prove "that [h]e would not have [experienced an adverse employment action] but for [a defendant's] alleged retaliation." Strong, 482 F.3d at 808.
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons are pretextual because once he was granted his accommodation, he improved his performance and "was able to close out all his outstanding cases." (Dkt. # 35 at 17.) Plaintiff also contends that his performance reviews prior to his protected activity "differ drastically" from those after that time. (Id.) Plaintiff asserts that he received a "meets" standards rating for his performance evaluations between July 2009 and February 2010, and that he did not consistently receive any "fails" ratings until after his protected activities. (Dkt. # 35 at 17.) Plaintiff also contends that he was given a "fails [*42]  rating" on an evaluation by Ms. Doyle on October 25, 2010, but that "her accounting expert, Nancy Williamsons . . . told [Ms. Doyle] that [Plaintiff's work] was right." (Dkt. # 35-2 at 18.)
The Court finds that Plaintiff has not produced sufficient evidence that he would not have experienced any adverse employment actions "but for" Defendant's retaliation for Plaintiff's engaging in protected activity. First, despite Plaintiff's contention that his work improved after he was granted an accommodation for his disability, the record demonstrates that he received an all "fails" rating in November 2010 on five key elements of his position as a Revenue Agent. (Dkt. # 27-2 at 124.) Plaintiff cites to no other evidence, other than his own declaration, that his worked improved subsequent to his accommodation in September 2010.
Next, Plaintiff's contention that he received a "meets" standards rating on his performance evaluations between July 2009 and December 2010, is not entirely supported by the record. While Plaintiff did receive some "meets" ratings, the ratings and comments in the evaluations make clear that Plaintiff struggled with key components on his job, including written communication, [*43]  in most, if not all, of his performance evaluations. For example, Plaintiff's October 21, 2009 review by Mr. Shaw states that "[t]his is the first case of yours that I have reviewed thus it does not surprise me to find errors but some of these errors do raise some concerns." Mr. Shaw cites Plaintiff's "inefficiency" as a concern, along with his failure to document his work activities on certain days and lack of detail for specific events. (Dkt. # 35-18 at 33, 37.) Additionally, Plaintiff's November 30, 2009 performance appraisal has a "fails" rating in the area of written communications. (Dkt. # 35-18 at 2.) His December 22, 2009 evaluation indicates that he still needed improvement in his written communication and he was informed that "[w]riting is such a critical part of a revenue agent's job and must be done with proficiency and accuracy." (Id. at 11.)
Because Plaintiff's first protected activity—his contact with the EEO counselor—occurred in June 2010, these performance evaluations, which occur prior to that date, do not support Plaintiff's assertion that his negative performance ratings occurred only after that time. Further, Plaintiff's own declaration that a tax expert disagreed with [*44]  Ms. Doyle's finding on a performance evaluation is only referenced in Plaintiff's own declaration; there are no details or other evidence which support this event. (See Dkt. # 35-2 at 18.)
On the record before this Court, Plaintiff has not rebutted Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for Plaintiff's adverse employment actions. Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Defendant's citation to poor performance as a reason for the adverse actions was pretext for retaliation. Additionally, Plaintiff has cited no evidence which rebuts Defendant's reason for Plaintiff's termination in that he engaged in inappropriate behavior in his January 6, 2011 meeting with Ms. Doyle and Mr. Simmons. Accordingly, there is no genuine issue of material fact on Plaintiff's claims for retaliation under the RA and Title VII. Summary judgment is granted for these claims.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 27), and DISMISSES WITH PREJUDICE Plaintiff's claims. The Clerk's Office is instructed to ENTER JUDGMENT and CLOSE this case.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
