CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS: (IN CHAMBERS) ORDER (1) GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (Doc. 29) AND (2) ORDERING PARTIES TO SHOW CAUSE WHY PLAINTIFF'S DEMAND FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SHOULD NOT BE REMANDED
Before the Court is Defendant Wal-Mart Associates, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (Mot., Doc. 29.) Plaintiff Ted Moorewood has submitted an Opposition (Opp'n, Doc. 34) and Wal-Mart replied (Reply, Doc. 39). For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Wal-Mart's Motion.

I. BACKGROUND1
In March 2013, Ted Moorewood joined Wal-Mart as a Sales Associate in its La Habra superstore and was soon promoted to Department Manager of the toy department and then Department Manager of the garden department. (SUF ¶¶ 90-91, Doc. 43.) As a Department Manager, Moorewood's duties included: "stocking and rotating merchandise[;] setting up, cleaning, and organizing product display[;] and arranging and organizing merchandise/supplies." (SUF ¶ 92.) To fulfill his job responsibilities, [*2]  Moorewood had to sometimes lift more than fifty pounds, but lifting more than ten pounds was not an "essential function" of his position. (Id. ¶¶ 93-94.)
On August 29, 2014, while he was moving fixtures weighing over fifty pounds, Moorewood tripped over a pallet jack and landed on a pillar, sustaining injuries to his neck, head, shoulder, back, and hip. (Id. ¶¶ 95-99.) Moorewood was instructed to take his lunch break and went home. (Id. ¶ 100.) While at home, Moorewood's mother and sister came over to check up on him. (Id. ¶ 101.) Seeing that her son was in pain, Moorewood's mother gave him a pill that she described to Moorewood as "a strong form of Tylenol." (Id. ¶ 102.) After a few hours at home, Moorewood returned to work to file a workers' compensation claim. (Id. ¶ 103.) Moorewood completed an accident report and was taken to Concentra for an examination. (Id. ¶ 104.) As part of the examination, Moorewood took a urine drug test. (Id. ¶ 105.) He informed the nurse that his mother had given him a pain pill. (Id.) Moorewood was instructed not to lift more than ten pounds, stand or walk for more than thirty minutes, bend more than five times per hour, push or pull anything weighing [*3]  over ten pounds, or squat or kneel. (Id. ¶ 106.) On September 2, 2014, he returned to the Concentra office and was given the same work restrictions. (Sept. 2 Work Restrictions, Exh. I, Doc. 32-1.)
When Moorewood returned to work on September 3, 2014, he gave his medical restrictions to Wal-Mart's human resources department, and Wal-Mart's Personnel Manager, Tina Rodriguez, instructed him not to lift more than ten pounds. (Id. ¶¶ 42, 107.) In contravention of its Accommodation in Employment Policy, Wal-Mart did not provide Moorewood with a Request for Accommodation Packet or a Request for Accommodation Form. (Id. ¶ 108.) Wal-Mart uses a document called the Temporary Alternative Duty ("TAD") form to memorialize discussions a Wal-Mart representative may have with an injured employee about the employee's physical restrictions and potential accommodations. (Id. ¶ 110.) The only TAD form in Moorewood's file is not signed by Moorewood or a Wal-Mart representative (Temporary Alternative Duty Assignment, Exh. F, Doc. 42-1), which was not in keeping with Wal-Mart's standard practice (Id. ¶ 110; Rivera Dep. 32:9-23, Doc. 37-5.) Because part of his job responsibilities included lifting heavy objects, [*4]  Moorewood informally asked other employees for assistance. (Moorewood Decl. ¶¶ 9-10, Doc. 37-7.) But his coworkers were often too busy to help, so Moorewood had to violate his lifting restrictions to fulfill his job responsibilities. (Id. ¶¶ 9-10.)
Moorewood made three more documented visits to the Concentra office—on September 5, 2014, September 12, 2014, and September 19, 2014. (See Work Restrictions, Exhs. J-L, Doc. 32-1.) The physician's assistants that he met with continued to place him on work restrictions, though during his September 12, 2014 visit the physician assistant lessened his work restrictions so that he could lift, push, pull, objects weighing less than 25 pounds. (Sept. 12 Work Restrictions, Exh. K, Doc. 32-1.) Although Moorewood continued to submit these medical restrictions to Wal-Mart's human resources department, no Wal-Mart representative had any further discussions with Moorewood about his injury or potential accommodations. (Id. ¶¶ 112-13.) On September 3, 2014 and September 24, 2014, Moorewood spoke to his direct supervisor Omar Rivera about the lack of any assistance. (Id. ¶ 114.) Rivera offered to investigate but never followed up with Moorewood. (Id. ¶ 115.) [*5] 
On September 12, 2014, Wal-Mart informed Moorewood that he had tested positive for extended opiates (specifically, hydrocodone and hydromorphone) and that he needed to contact the Medical Review Officer. (SUF ¶¶ 8-10; Notification, Exh. F, Doc. 32-2; Drug Test Report, Exh. G, Doc. 32-2; Moorewood Dep. 99:25-100:3, Doc. 32-1.) Moorewood explained to the Store Manager James Harmon that his mother gave him the pill after his accident. (SUF ¶ 11.) As requested, Moorewood contacted the Medical Review Officer and explained his reason for taking the pill, but the Medical Review Officer never followed up. (SUF ¶¶ 121-22.) On September 18, 2014, Moorewood provided a written explanation of the incident, acknowledging that he took the medicine provided by his mother. (SUF ¶ 12; Written Statement, Exh. H.)
On September 24, 2014, Wal-Mart terminated Moorewood. (SUF ¶ 12.) Omar Velasco stated on his Exit Interview form that Moorewood was terminated for violating Wal-Mart's "Alcohol and Drug Free Workplace Policy" (Exit Interview, Exh. A, Doc. 32-3), which prohibits employees from "[u]sing a prescription drug without a valid prescription for the drug, unless a valid medical explanation is approved [*6]  by the Medical Review Officer." (Alcohol and Drug Free Workplace Policy, Exh. A, Doc. 32-2.)2 Harmon asserts that the drug policy department at Wal-Mart's headquarters, not anyone at the La Habra store, made the decision to terminate Moorewood. (Harmon Dep. 61:16-24.)
Moorewood filed this lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court on April 1, 2016. (Compl., Exh. A, Doc. 3.) In his Complaint, Moorewood alleges claims under FEHA for (1) discrimination, (2) failure to accommodate, (3) failure to engage in the interactive process, (4) failure to prevent discrimination, (5) retaliation, and (6) wrongful termination as well as a common law claim for (7) wrongful termination in violation of public policy. (Id. ¶¶ 18-69.) Plaintiff also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. (Id. ¶¶ 70-80.) On May 6, 2016, Wal-Mart removed this case to federal court. (Notice of Removal, Doc. 1.)

II. LEGAL STANDARD
In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all justifiable inferences in that party's favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Summary judgment is proper "if the [moving party] shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact [*7]  and the [moving party] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. A factual dispute is "genuine" when there is sufficient evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could resolve the issue in the non-movant's favor, and a fact is "material" when it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. But "credibility determinations, the weighing of evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge." Acosta v. City of Costa Mesa, 718 F.3d 800, 828 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The role of the Court is not to resolve disputes of fact but to assess whether there are any factual disputes to be tried.
The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute of fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "Once the moving party carries its initial burden, the adverse party 'may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading,' but must provide affidavits or other sources of evidence that 'set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).

III. DISCUSSION
In its Motion, Wal-Mart moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims. (Mot.) The Court will address each claim in turn. [*8] 

a. FEHA Unlawful Discrimination Claim
In adjudicating claims of disparate treatment under FEHA, California follows the burden-shifting framework enunciated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1113 (Cal. 2000); Wills v. Super. Ct., 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 15 (Ct. App. 2011). In the first stage, a plaintiff must submit a prima facie case of disability discrimination. Id. A prima facie case includes evidence that the plaintiff "[1] suffered from a disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability; [2] could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations, and [3] was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or perceived disability." Id. A plaintiff's burden in establishing a prima facie case is "minimal." Id. If the plaintiff satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a "legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision." Id. (citation omitted). Finally, if the defendant identifies a nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision, the burden shifts once more to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the "defendant intentionally discriminated against him or her." Id. A plaintiff may demonstrate intentional discrimination by showing that the reason offered by the defendant was false, [*9]  thereby raising "an inference that those reasons served as a pretext for discrimination." Id.
In this case, Wal-Mart contends that even if Moorewood meets his minimal burden in establishing a prima facie case, he cannot show that Wal-Mart's stated reason for terminating Moorewood—specifically, his violation of the drug policy—was pretextual. (Mem. at 6-8.) Moorewood argues that he did not violate Wal-Mart's Alcohol and Drug Free Workplace policy because he provided the Medical Review Officer with "a valid medical explanation." (Opp'n at 13.) Moorewood notes that, as instructed, he called the Medical Review Officer and explained that his mother had provided him with the pill after he was injured at work. (Opp'n at 13; SUF ¶ 121.)
Wal-Mart's policy, however, does not elaborate on what constitutes a "valid medical explanation" for taking an unprescribed medication. Rather, the policy appears to vest decision-making authority with the Medical Review Officer on a case-by-case basis. (See Alcohol and Drug Free Workplace Policy, Exh. A.) Under these circumstances, the Medical Review Officer' determination that Moorewood had not supplied a valid medical explanation does not imply that Wal-Mart's [*10]  proffered reason for terminating Moorewood was pretextual. Moorewood provides no evidence, for example, that the Medical Review Officer found that other employees with similar excuses had a valid medical explanation for taking unprescribed medication.
The only other evidence Moorewood provides of disability discrimination is Wal-Mart's alleged violations of its accommodations policies, including its failure to provide him a Request for Accommodation Packet or Request for Accommodation Form and Wal-Mart's failure to complete a Temporary Duty Form. (See, e.g., SUF ¶ 16.) But Wal-Mart's failure to provide these accommodation documents does not reasonably suggest that its subsequent decision to terminate Moorewood was pretextual. Besides, Moorewood provides no evidence that the employees who failed to provide him with Wal-Mart's accommodation documentation were involved in any way in Wal-Mart's decision to terminate him. Thus, as no reasonable jury could find that Wal-Mart's reason for terminating Moorewood was pretextual, and the Court GRANTS Wal-Mart's Motion for summary judgment on Moorewood's claim of disability discrimination.3

b. Retaliation Claim
To establish a prima facie case of [*11]  retaliation, Moorewood "must show that [1] he . . . engaged in a protected activity, [2] his employer subjected him to adverse employment action, and [3] there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." Flait v. N. Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal. App. 4th 467, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522, 528 (Ct. App. 1992). Understandably, Moorewood does not oppose Wal-Mart's Motion for summary judgment on his retaliation claim (Opp'n at 5 n.2), because in Rope v. Auto-Chlor Sys. of Washington, Inc., the California Court of Appeal held that "a mere request—or even repeated requests—for an accommodation," does not qualify as protected activity under FEHA. 220 Cal. App. 4th 635, 163 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 407 (Ct. App. 2013). Rope's holding was overturned by the California Legislature in 2015, see 2015 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 122 (A.B. 987), but the California Court of Appeal has held that this amendment does not apply retrospectively, Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841, 867 (Ct. App. 2016). Because Moorewood has identified no potentially protected conduct other than his request for a reasonable accommodation, the Court GRANTS Wal-Mart's Motion for summary judgment on Moorewood's retaliation claim.

c. Failure to Prevent Disability Discrimination Claim Under FEHA
Under FEHA, an employer's failure "to take all reasonable steps to prevent" disability discrimination is a separate cause of action. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). [*12]  To prove a claim for failure to prevent disability discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must show "[1] [he] was subjected to discrimination, harassment or retaliation; [2] [the] defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination, harassment or retaliation; and [3] this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Lelaind v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1103 (N.D. Cal. 2008). Moorewood concedes that his claim for failure to prevent disability discrimination is derivative of his claims for disability discrimination and retaliation (Opp'n at 14-15). See Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596, 599 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding that an employee must demonstrate that he has suffered discrimination to succeed on a claim for failure to prevent discrimination). As such, the Court GRANTS Wal-Mart's Motion for Summary Judgment on Moorewood's claim for failure to prevent disability discrimination.

d. Wrongful Discharge Under FEHA
Moorewood's claim for wrongful discharge under FEHA is contingent on him succeeding on either his retaliation or discrimination claim. (See Opp'n at 15-16.) Because the Court has granted summary judgment to Wal-Mart on Plaintiff's retaliation and discrimination claims, the Court also GRANTS summary judgment on Plaintiff's wrongful discharge claim under [*13]  FEHA.

e. Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy
To succeed on a common law claim for wrongful discharge, Moorewood must show that [1] he was employed by Wal-Mart, [2] Wal-Mart terminated him, [3] a substantial motivating reason for Moorewood's termination contravenes public policy, [4] Moorewood suffered resulting harm. Haney v. Aramark Unif. Servs., Inc., 121 Cal. App. 4th 623, 17 Cal. Rptr. 3d 336, 349 (Ct. App. 2004). Here, the only public policy Moorewood identifies is FEHA's prohibition on disability discrimination. (Opp'n at 15-16.) Because the Court has granted Wal-Mart summary judgment on Moorewood's claim for disability discrimination, the Court also grants summary judgment on Moorewood's common law claim for wrongful discharge. Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487, 496-97 (Ct. App. 1999) ("[B]ecause [plaintiff's] FEHA claim fails, his claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy fails.").

f. Reasonable Accommodation Claim
To prevail on a reasonable accommodation claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate [1] he is disabled, [2] he is a "qualified individual" (i.e., "he . . . is able to perform the essential duties of the position with or without reasonable accommodation"), [3] plaintiff's employer knew of his disability, [4] the plaintiff requested a reasonable accommodation or the need for a reasonable accommodation [*14]  was obvious to the employer, [5] plaintiff's employer failed to reasonably accommodate him, and [6] as a result of his employer's failure to accommodate, the plaintiff suffered "injury, damage, loss[,] or harm." See Green v. State, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118, 126 (Cal. 2007); Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 798-99 (N.D. Cal. 2015); Cal. Jury Instr. Civ. 12.12.5. "The reasonableness of an accommodation is generally a question of fact." Achal, 114 F. Supp. 3d at 799. Here, Wal-Mart does not dispute that Moorewood, although disabled, was able to perform the essential functions of his position, and that he repeatedly submitted his work restrictions to Wal-Mart's human resources department. (SUF ¶¶ 94, 107, 112; Mem. at 12-13.) The only question, therefore, is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that Wal-Mart failed to provide a reasonable accommodation.
Viewed in the light most favorable to Moorewood, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could conclude that Wal-Mart failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. The only accommodation that Wal-Mart provided was Rodriguez's instruction not to lift more than ten pounds. (Reply at 7-8.) Moorewood claims that Wal-Mart did not provide him with any assistance so that he could complete his responsibilities as Department Management, and as a result he had to repeatedly violate his work restrictions. (Moorewood [*15]  Decl. ¶¶ 9-10.) Twice Moorewood complained to Omar Rivera about Wal-Mart's failure to accommodate his injury, but Wal-Mart took no action. (Id. ¶ 10.) Although not dispositive, Wal-Mart's purported failure to comply with its own policies on providing reasonable accommodations adds credence to Moorewood's claim. Specifically, Moorewood claims he never received an accommodation packet or accommodation form, and the only temporary assistance duty form is not signed by either Moorewood or a Wal-Mart representative. (Id. ¶¶ 108, 110; Rivera Dep. 32:9-23.) Because a reasonable jury could conclude that Wal-Mart did not reasonably accommodate Moorewood's disability, the Court DENIES Wal-Mart's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim.

g. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Under FEHA, an employer's failure "to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with [an] employee" is a freestanding cause of action. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). To succeed on this claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate [1] that he is disabled, [2] that a reasonable accommodation was available, [3] that plaintiff disclosed that he was disabled or the employer knew that he was disabled, [4] that plaintiff, [*16]  in good faith, requested that the employer engage in the interactive process, and [5] the defendant failed to engage in the interactive process, and [6] as a result, Plaintiff suffered "injury, damage, loss[,] or harm." Cal. Jury Instr. Civ. 12.12.5; see Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338, 365 (Ct. App. 2009). "Once initiated, [an] employer has a continuous obligation to engage in the interactive process in good faith." Swanson v. Morongo Unified Sch. Dist., 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553, 567 (Ct. App. 2014). If the interactive process fails, "[l]iability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith." Id. at 568.
A reasonable jury could conclude that Wal-Mart failed to continue to engage in the interactive process in good faith. The extent of Wal-Mart's interactive process with Moorewood appears to be the initial conversation during which Rodriguez instructed him not to lift more than ten pounds. (SUF ¶¶ 52-53; Reply at 8.) There was no follow-up, even though Moorewood attests that he complained about his injury to Rivera on September 3, 2014 and September 24, 2014. (Moorewood Decl. ¶ 10.) Again, while Wal-Mart's contravention of its internal policies is not determinative, its purported failure to provide Moorewood with an [*17]  accommodations packet or accommodation form, and Wal-Mart's failure to complete a temporary assistance form strengthens Moorewood's claim. (Id. ¶¶ 108, 110; Rivera Dep. 32:9-23.) A reasonable jury could conclude based on this evidence that Wal-Mart did not continue to engage in the interactive process in good faith, so the Court DENIES Wal-Mart's Motion for summary judgment on Moorewood's claim.

h. Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
Defendant argues that Moorewood's causes of action for declaratory relief and injunctive relief are "superfluous and unnecessary." (Reply at 9.) The Court agrees that injunctive and declaratory relief are not separate causes of action, McDowell v. Watson, 59 Cal. App. 4th 1155, 69 Cal. Rptr. 2d 692, 695-96 (Ct. App. 1997); Bosco Wai-Choy Chiu v. NBS Default Servs., LLC, No. 14-CV-05261-EDL, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33721, 2015 WL 1221399, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 17, 2015); so the Court DISMISSES these causes of action while leaving Plaintiff's demands for injunctive and declaratory relief in his prayer for relief.
Separately, although neither party raises Article III standing, the Court has an independent obligation to ensure that it has subject matter jurisdiction throughout a suit. See U.S. Catholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, 487 U.S. 72, 79 (1988), 108 S. Ct. 2268, 101 L. Ed. 2d 69. Here, it not obvious that Moorewood has Article III standing to pursue his request for injunctive relief in federal court. Thus, the Court hereby ORDERS Moorewood and Wal-Mart to show cause by February 3, 2017 why Moorewood's [*18]  demand for injunctive relief should not be remanded to Orange County Superior Court for lack of Article III standing. See Lee v. Am. Nat. Ins. Co., 260 F.3d 997, 1006 (9th Cir. 2001).

i. Punitive Damages
Under California law, punitive damages are only appropriate where a plaintiff shows by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant is "guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice." McInteer v. Ashley Distribution Servs., Ltd., 40 F. Supp. 3d 1269, 1295 (C.D. Cal. 2014). For corporate employers, the conduct at issue must involve officers, directors, or managing agents of the corporation. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(b). "Managing agents" are "only those . . . employees who exercise substantial independent authority and judgment in their corporate decision[-]making so that their decisions ultimately determine corporate policy." White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 563, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944, 947 (Cal. 1999). "'Malice,' is defined as 'conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.'" Johnson Indus. Sales, Inc. v. Strema Sales Corp., 224 F. App'x 709, 711 (9th Cir. 2007).
Here, while Omar Rivera managed over forty people, made hiring determinations, and helped resolve accommodations requests at the La Habra store (SUF ¶ 123), there is no evidence that he—or anyone else involved in the failure to provide Moorewood with a reasonable accommodation or engage in the interactive process—exercised [*19]  "substantial independent authority and judgment in their corporate decision[-]making so that their decisions ultimately determine[d] corporate policy." See White, 981 P.2d at 947. Nor is there any evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that the Wal-Mart employees involved in the alleged failure to provide Moorewood with a reasonable accommodation or engage in the interactive process acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. See Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a). As there is no genuine dispute of material fact about whether Plaintiff may obtain punitive damages, the Court GRANTS Wal-Mart's Motion.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Wal-Mart's Motion. The Court GRANTS the Motion with respect to Moorewood's first, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action. The Court also GRANTS the Motion with respect to Moorewood's demand for punitive damages. The Court DISMISSES Plaintiff's separate causes of action for declaratory and injunctive relief. Wal-Mart's Motion is otherwise DENIED. Finally, the Court hereby ORDERS Wal-Mart and Moorewood to show cause by February 3, 2017 why Moorewood's demand for injunctive relief should not be remanded to Orange County Superior Court [*20]  for lack of Article III standing.
