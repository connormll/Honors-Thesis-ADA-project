CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): The Court DENIES the motion to dismiss
Before the Court is a motion to dismiss brought by Defendant Kiewit Power Constructors Co., sued as Kiewit Corporation ("Defendant"). See Dkt. # 17 ("Mot."). Plaintiff Kevin Walls ("Plaintiff") opposes, see Dkt. # 18 ("Opp."), and Defendant replied, see Dkt. # 19 ("Reply"). The Court finds the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. Having considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss.
I. Background
A. Factual Background
Plaintiff makes the following factual allegations, among others, in his First Amended Complaint ("FAC"). Defendant hired Plaintiff to work at the Alamitos Generating Station in Long Beach, California, on February 22, 2018. See First Amended Complaint, Dkt. # 15 ("FAC"), ¶ 9. Plaintiff was hired as a union boilermaker, and his job duties included crane-use rigging. Id. Plaintiff was scheduled to work four 10-hour days, and two 8-hour days. Id.
Plaintiff was told by an [*2]  onsite foreman "Jason," that he was "an old man," and that he needed to "slow down." Id. ¶ 10. Plaintiff was 59-years old, and was almost 40 years older than several of his coworkers. Id.
One day later, at a morning meeting, Plaintiff requested protective gloves as a form of Personal Protective Equipment ("PPE"). Id. ¶ 11. Plaintiff requested these gloves as a form of protective equipment aimed at safeguarding his hands from the rigors of his work. Id. Plaintiff's supervisor, David Boice, responded "No you are not [requesting them]." Id. Plaintiff understood Boice's comments to refer to the fact that Defendant did not and would not provide Plaintiff with the gloves. Id.
Later that day, Plaintiff was assigned to dismantle steel using a torch. Id. ¶ 12. On eleven occasions Plaintiff requested protective gloves and each time he was denied, without explanation. Id.
As a direct result of being denied the requested equipment, Plaintiff's hands were burned from his work using a steel torch. Id. ¶ 13. Plaintiff showed his supervisor that he was injured and burned, and explained to his supervisor that he was unable to continue working without incurring additional injury and without suffering immense [*3]  pain, thereby constituting a disability. Id. Despite knowing of his injury, Defendant failed to engage Plaintiff in a good faith interactive process, to accommodate him, and failed to provide him with the requested equipment, the protective gloves, that would enable him to perform his job. Id. Plaintiff alleges that the request for protective gloves was in accordance with OSHA regulations. Id. ¶ 14.
Later, Plaintiff overheard someone saying "[t]here is a guy in the south yard asking for leather gloves." Id. ¶ 15. Soon after, the foreman told Plaintiff that "management had decided to terminate him." Id. He added "They did not want to see you get hurt," which was "a reference to [Plaintiff's] age and disability." Id.
In addition, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knew that "it was obligated to provide Plaintiff with PPE, and, medical treatment, but Defendant did not want to expend money or resources on procuring and providing Plaintiff with PPE, and further, did not want to affect its workers compensation modification rating by treating and reporting Plaintiff's disability," and that Defendant "thereby placed its own economic well-being ahead of Plaintiff's health and safety." Id. ¶ 19. [*4]  Defendant also "recognized Plaintiff's legitimate complaint about the need for PPE, and, wanted to silence Plaintiff before he could rally other employees to request the same of Defendant." Id. ¶ 20.
B. Procedural Background
On August 19, 2019 Plaintiff sued Defendant in Los Angeles Superior Court. See generally Complaint, Dkt. # 1-1 ("Compl."). On September 25, 2019 Defendant removed the action to this Court, on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See Notice of Removal, Dkt. # 1. Defendant moved to dismiss various of Plaintiff's claims based on disability discrimination and the Court granted Defendant's motion, with leave to amend. See Dkt. # 14 ("December 17 Order").
On January 27, 2020, Plaintiff filed the FAC, bringing the following causes of action:
First Cause of Action: Disability discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), California Government Code §§ 12940 et seq. FAC ¶¶ 23 38.
Second Cause of Action: Age discrimination in violation of FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 39 53.
Third Cause of Action: Failure to accommodate disability in violation of FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 54 68.
Fourth Cause of Action: Failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 69 83.
Fifth Cause of Action: Failure to prevent [*5]  discrimination in violation of FEHA, on the basis of disability, age, and protected conduct. Id. ¶¶ 84 91.
Sixth Cause of Action: Retaliation in violation of FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 92 98.
Seventh Cause of Action: Wrongful termination. Id. ¶¶ 99 108.
Eighth Cause of Action: Violation of Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq. Id. ¶¶ 109 15.
Defendant now moves to dismiss Plaintiff's FAC in its entirety. See generally Mot.
II. Legal Standard
To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must "contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). In assessing the adequacy of the complaint, the court must accept all pleaded facts as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Turner v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 788 F.3d 1206, 1210 (9th Cir. 2015); Cousins v. Lockyer, 568 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir. 2009). The court then determines whether the complaint "allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. However, "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id. Accordingly, "for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, the non-conclusory factual content, and reasonable inferences from that content, must [*6]  be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief." Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).
III. Discussion
A. First Cause of Action: Disability Discrimination
FEHA protects employees from discrimination based on a wide variety of grounds, including disability. Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a). To establish a prima facie case for disability discrimination, the plaintiff must demonstrate that he: "(1) suffered from a disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability; (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations; and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or perceived disability." Wills v. Superior Court, 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 159, 60, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011). Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff has now properly pleaded that he suffered from a disability, but argues that Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to establish the second or third elements. Mot. 5 8.

i. Qualified Individual
"Essential functions" are defined as "fundamental job duties of the employment position," not "marginal functions" of the position. See Cal. Gov. Code § 12926(f). A "qualified individual" is an employee who (1) has the "requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position," and [*7]  (2) can perform the "essential functions" of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation. 2 C.C.R. § 11065(o); Bates v. UPS, 511 F.3d 974, 989 (9th Cir. 2007).
In Plaintiff's FAC, while he has not added a more detailed description of the functions of the job, he has added factual allegations involving his request for protective leather gloves, the purpose of his request to "safeguard[] Plaintiff's hands from the rigors of his work," and that had Defendant provided Plaintiff with the protective leather gloves, it "would have enabled Plaintiff to perform his job with an appropriate accommodation." FAC ¶¶ 11 13. The Court concludes that, while sparse, these added factual allegations, which already included Plaintiff's job title and location, working hours, and various duties of the position, allow for a reasonable inference that Plaintiff could perform functions of the "union boilermaker" job, including "crane-use rigging" and "dismantl[ing] steel using a torch," with an identified reasonable accommodation: the use of protective leather gloves. See id. ¶¶ 9, 12, 13; cf. Silveria v. Wilkie, No. 18-CV-07327-EMC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156278, 2019 WL 4345947, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 12, 2019) ("The SAC provides his job title but does not describes any functions for which a Rating Veterans Service Representative is responsible . . [*8]  . . [and it] does not allege that [plaintiff] could perform those function with or without a reasonable accommodation."). Plaintiff's added allegations allow for the reasonable inference that with an accommodation, protective leather gloves, he would be able to effectively and safely perform his essential job functions. See King v. C&K Mkt., Inc., No. 2:16-cv-00559-TLN-CMK, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25352, 2018 WL 934551, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 15, 2018) (employee's speculation that "she would be able to return to work with reasonable accommodations and perform the essential functions of her job" after unspecified duration of medical leave insufficient); Ravel v. Hewlett-Packard Enter., Inc., 228 F. Supp. 3d 1086, 1093 (E.D. Cal. 2017) (finding Plaintiff was a qualified individual because she specifically alleged her ability to continue her managerial duties if she was able to work in a nearby office or from home).

ii. Substantial Motivating Factor
To satisfy the third element of a disability discrimination claim, the plaintiff's disability must have been a "substantial motivating factor in the particular employment decision." Harris v. Santa Monica, 56 Cal. 4th 203, 232, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 294 P.3d 49 (2013).
Plaintiff has still failed to allege more specific factual details surrounding the circumstances of his termination. See generally FAC; December 17 Order at 6. However, Plaintiff has now pleaded that he explained his disability [*9]  in detail and his need for protective gloves to his supervisor, Boice, that Defendant knew of his alleged disability and need for protective equipment, that when he was terminated he was told that management "did not want to see [him] get hurt" which was in part a reference to his disability, and that providing the requested equipment would be expensive to Defendant, that Defendant did not want to affect its workers compensation modification rating by treating and reporting Plaintiff's disability, and that Defendant feared that other employees would request such gloves as well. See FAC ¶¶ 13 15, 19 20. This provides an alleged discriminatory motive and alleged connection between Plaintiff's disability and termination. The Court concludes that these added allegations, read in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, allow for an inference that his disability was a "substantial motivating factor" for his termination.
Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has adequately pleaded his first cause of action for disability discrimination. The Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss the first cause of action.
B. Third Cause of Action: Failure to Accommodate
It is an unlawful employment [*10]  practice for an employer "to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee" unless the employer demonstrates doing so would impose an undue hardship. Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m). The essential elements of a failure to accommodate claim are: "(1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by the FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual (i.e., he or she can perform the essential functions of the position); and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Wilson v. Cty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009).
Defendant argues that this claim fails on the same basis as Plaintiff's first claim: that Plaintiff has not adequately alleged that Plaintiff is a qualified individual. See Mot. 9:5 10:5. However, as the Court has already concluded that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that he is a qualified individual for purposes of his disability discrimination claim, the Court finds that this is true for this claim, as well. See FAC ¶¶ 9, 12, 13. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss the third cause of action.
C. Fourth Cause of Action: Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
It is unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, [*11]  interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n). "The 'interactive process' required by the FEHA is an informal process with the employee or the employee's representative, to attempt to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1003, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). To prevail, "the employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that was available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Id. at 995 (cleaned up). A "reasonable accommodation" is an accommodation that "enable[s] an employee to perform the essential functions of the job the employee holds." 2 C.C.R. § 11065(p)(1)(B).
Defendant argues that this claim should be dismissed because Plaintiff has failed to allege that he was a qualified individual or requested a reasonable accommodation but, as discussed, the Court concludes that Plaintiff had adequately pleaded these aspects of his claims in his FAC. See Mot. 10. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege that he requested gloves after [*12]  his alleged injury, at the time the interactive process should have occurred. Id. However, Plaintiff has alleged that he repeatedly requested protective leather gloves and was denied and sustained an injury, that he explained his injury to his supervisor and that he could not continue with his job duties due to the burning of his hands, and that Defendant continued to refuse to provide him with the requested protective leather gloves that would have enabled him to perform his job with an appropriate accommodation. See FAC ¶¶ 12 13. While the timing of his multiple requests for protective gloves is not entirely clear from Plaintiff's pleadings, the Court finds these allegations nevertheless sufficient to identify and plead a reasonable accommodation that was available at the time the interactive process should have occurred, and a failure to engage in the interactive process. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss the fourth cause of action.
D. Second Cause of Action: Age Discrimination
To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, a Plaintiff must demonstrate (1) he is at least forty years old; (2) he was performing competently in the position he held; (3) [*13]  he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) he was either replaced by substantially younger employees with equal or inferior qualifications or discharged under circumstances otherwise giving rise to an inference of discrimination. Smith v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., No. EDCV 18-1405 JGB (SPx), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67412, 2019 WL 1670942, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 5, 2019) (citing Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 355, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000)); Schechner v. KPIX-TV, 686 F.3d 1018, 1023 (9th Cir. 2012).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged facts to support the second element, that he was performing competently, and the fourth element, that Defendant acted with a discriminatory motive or that he was discharged on the basis of age. See Mot. 12 13. However, the factual allegations in Plaintiff's complaint taken as a whole fairly suggest that he was performing his job competently, or could do so with a reasonable accommodation. In addition, Plaintiff has alleged that the foreman called him an "old man," that he was older than several employees, and, when telling Plaintiff he was terminated, said that management "did not want to see him get hurt," which was allegedly "a reference to his age," sufficient at the pleading stage to allege circumstances giving rise to an inference of age discrimination to plead a prima facie case. See FAC ¶¶ 10, 15. Plaintiff has also alleged that [*14]  he was "replaced with an employee below the age of 40," see FAC ¶ 42. See Gutierrez v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., Inc., No. C 11-3428 CW, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150069, 2012 WL 5372607, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 30, 2012) ("Plaintiff has shown that he was over forty years old when Kaiser terminated him, was qualified to serve as Kaiser's lead biomedical engineer, and was replaced by a younger employee, Elias Flores. [] These fact are sufficient to meet his initial burden."). Accordingly, the Court concludes that this cause of action is adequately pleaded, and DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's second cause of action.
E. Fifth Cause of Action: Failure to Prevent Discrimination
A failure to prevent discrimination claim is essentially a derivative claim based on discrimination under FEHA. See Trujillo v. North Cnty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998) ("There's no logic that says an employee who has not been discriminated against can sue an employer for not preventing discrimination that didn't happen, [or] for not having a policy to prevent discrimination when no discrimination occurred."). Defendant argues that because Plaintiff has failed to allege a disability or age discrimination claim, this cause of action fails. See Mot. 13:16 26. However, the Court has concluded [*15]  that Plaintiff has adequately alleged these discrimination claims, and accordingly the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss the fifth cause of action.
F. Sixth Cause of Action: Retaliation
It is unlawful for an employer to "discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part [FEHA] or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(h). To make out a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show "(1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) [an employer] subjected him to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the [employer's] action." Dinslage v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 5 Cal. App. 5th 368, 380 81 (2016).
Plaintiff does not allege that he opposed any age discrimination practices, thus his retaliation claim rests on the disability claims. See generally FAC; Mot. 14:13 14. Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to show that he engaged in a protected activity, or to establish causation. See Mot. 14:19 16:19.

i. Engaged in a Protected Activity
For protection under the "opposition" clause, "an employee must have opposed an employment practice [*16]  made unlawful by the statute." Dinslage, 5 Cal. App. 5th at 381. "[W]hile a plaintiff need not have invoked magic words in order for his complaints to constitute protected activity, he must have alerted his employer to his belief that discrimination, not merely unfair personnel treatment, had occurred." Gutierrez, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150069, 2012 WL 5372607, at *5 (internal quotations omitted). A plaintiff "must not only show that he subjectively (that is, in good faith) believed that his employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices, but also that his belief was objectively reasonable in light of the facts and record presented," and the "objective reasonableness of an employee's belief that his employer has engaged in a prohibited employment practice must be measured against existing substantive law." Dinslage, 5 Cal. App. 5th at 381 82 (internal quotations omitted).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged "that Plaintiff conveyed to Defendant that it was 'acting in an unlawful discriminatory manner,' or that he made any complaints." Mot. 15:16 20. However, Plaintiff has alleged in the FAC that after being denied the protective equipment, the leather gloves he requested, and suffering an injury, he "promptly showed his supervisor that he was injured and burned," that he "explained [*17]  to his supervisor that he was unable to continue working without incurring additional injury . . . constituting a disability under the law," and that Defendant nevertheless failed to provide him with requested protective equipment or engage him in a good faith interactive process. See FAC ¶¶ 13, 17 ("Plaintiff reported [that he sustained injury and disability to his hands] to his supervisor," and lodged "complaints"). Plaintiff has thus alleged that he requested an accommodation for his disability multiple times and complained to his supervisor about his disability and the denial of protective equipment, sufficient to plausibly plead that he alerted his employer to an unlawful employment practice. See id.; see also Cenis v. WinCo Holdings, Inc., No. 1:17-cv-00863-DADJLT, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89301, 2018 WL 2412324, at *7 (E.D. Cal. May 29, 2018), aff'd, 787 F. App'x 947 (9th Cir. 2019) ("Effective January 1, 2016, California Assembly Bill No. 987 established that a request for a reasonable accommodation for a disability may constitute a protected activity.") (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12940 (amended by A.B. 987, 2015 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 122)).

ii. Causation
The "decision maker's knowledge of protected activity [is] necessary for causation." Soares v. California, No. 2:16-00128 WBS EFB, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84044, 2016 WL 3519411, at *5 (E.D. Cal. June 28, 2016) (quoting Billberry v. Brennan, 608 Fed. App'x. 553, 554 (9th Cir. 2015)). "In the absence of direct evidence, [*18]  a causal link requires showing that the defendant knew of the protected activity and that the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action was 'very close.'" Gutierrez, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150069, 2012 WL 5372607, at *5.
Plaintiff has pleaded in the FAC that he in detail explained his disability and his need for protective gloves to his supervisor, Boice, and that providing such equipment would be expensive to Defendant, that Defendant "knew of his injury" and his request for protective equipment, and that Defendant "recognized Plaintiff's legitimate complaint about the need for PPE, and, wanted to silence Plaintiff before he could rally other employees to request the same of Defendant." See FAC ¶¶ 12 15, 20. He has thus alleged a causal link between his engaging in protected activity and his termination, which occurred close in time. See id.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has adequately pleaded his sixth cause of action for retaliation. The Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss this cause of action.
G. Seventh and Eighth Causes of Action: Wrongful Termination And Unfair Business Practices
In order to sustain a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of fundamental public policy, a plaintiff must prove "that his dismissal [*19]  violated a policy that is (1) fundamental, (2) beneficial for the public, and (3) embodied in a statute or constitutional provision." Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994); FAC ¶¶ 99 108. Plaintiff also seeks damages under California's Unfair Competition Law based on violation of FEHA. See FAC ¶¶ 109 15; Herr v. Nestle U.S.A., Inc., 109 Cal. App. 4th 779, 789, 135 Cal. Rptr. 2d 477 (2003).
Defendant argues that these claims are derivative of Plaintiff's FEHA claims, and that because Plaintiff's underlying FEHA claims fail, these derivative claims fail and must be dismissed. Mot. 17:3 15. However, the Court has concluded that Plaintiff has adequately alleged the underlying FEHA claims. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss these causes of action.
IV. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
