ORDER
THIS CAUSE comes before the Court for consideration of the Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkts. 33, 34) filed by Defendant, Infectious Disease Associates, P.A., the Response in opposition thereto filed by Plaintiff, Dorothy E. Winnie (Dkt. 37), and Defendant's reply. (Dkt. 39) Upon consideration of all relevant filings, case law, and being otherwise fully advised, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Dorothy E. Winnie ("Winnie" or "Plaintiff") brings this suit against Defendant Infectious Disease Associations, P.A. ("IDA" or "Defendant") and alleges discriminatory discharge from her employment following her rotator cuff surgery. (Dkt. 22) Winnie alleges that IDA's actions violated [*2]  the Americans with Disabilities Act, as Amended ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.; and the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 ("FCRA"). (Id.)1 Winnie also asserts a state law claim of promissory estoppel against IDA.
IDA is a specialized medical practice located in Sarasota County, Florida that diagnoses and treats patients with infections and infectious diseases. (Dkts. 31, 33, 36) IDA provides intravenous ("IV") services 365 days a year and hires only highly skilled IV nurses to work in the IV room. (Dkt. 36 ¶ 8) No other employees are hired to work in the IV room, except trained IV nurses. (Id. ¶ 7) In January 2003, IDA hired Winnie as a full-time IV nurse. (Id. ¶ 18, Dkt. 31 ¶ 16) Winnie, who had been a registered nurse for more than 18 years, was 58 years old when she was hired by IDA. (Dkt. 36 ¶ 20) She was hired to work 40 hours or more weekly, including some weekends. (Id. ¶ 22) Winnie was hired as an at-will employee and remained as such throughout her employment relationship with IDA. (Id. ¶ 19) All IV nurses are required to use both hands and arms to insert butterfly needles into patients' veins, wrap tourniquets around patients' arms, remove needles [*3]  from patients' arms while applying pressure, remove and reapply compression stockings, help patients who are unsteady on their feet or in wheelchairs, assist patients out of recliner chairs, carry IV bags and boxes of medications, place supplies on shelves, hold infusion bags and coordinate them with antibiotic vials, screw needles into syringes, mix drugs, and take gloves on and off for each patient. (Id. ¶¶ 12, 13, 47) IV nurses also are required to lift more than five pounds and reach overhead. (Id. ¶ 39)
In November 2012, at the age of 68, Winnie requested to reduce her work hours starting in January 2013. (Id. ¶¶ 23, 24; Dkt. 34-4 ¶ 23) IDA granted her request, "effectively creating a new position for Plaintiff to allow Plaintiff to work approximately thirty-two (32) hours per week and retain employee benefits." (Dkt. 36 ¶ 25; Dkt. 31 ¶ 17) In 2013, Winnie began working the reduced schedule. (Dkt. 36 ¶ 26) At this time, Winnie had not informed IDA that she had a history of a medical impairment, did not request any accommodation for problems with her shoulder, and did not experience any interference with her duties as an IV nurse or her daily life activities, aside from some discomfort [*4]  that sometimes prevented a good night's sleep. (Id. ¶¶ 30, 33)
On February 7, 2014, Winnie had an appointment with her physician, who scheduled her rotator cuff surgery on February 18, 2014. (Id. ¶ 35) Winnie alleges that on or about the same day, she gave notice that she was requesting a leave of absence for the surgery and provided her supervisor, Susan Padalik ("Padalik"), with a copy of the estimated post-operative restrictions. (Dkt. 22 ¶ 23; Dkt. 36 ¶ 42) The restrictions, dated February 7, 2014, stated that: 1) Winnie could not work at all for two weeks following the procedure; 2) she could not use her upper extremity from two weeks to eight weeks following the procedure; and 3) she would be restricted to "light duty" from eight weeks to four months following the procedure. (Dkt. 22-2 at 7) Under each restriction description, dates were handwritten: 1) February 18 and February 24, 2014 at 8:30 a.m. were under the restriction for the first two weeks; 2) April 15, 2014 was written under the restriction from two weeks to eight weeks; and 3) April 15, 2014 and June 17, 2014 were written under the "light duty" restriction from eight weeks to four months. (Id.) Winnie alleges that [*5]  IDA told her the recovery period was acceptable and that her leave request would "not be a problem." (Dkt. 22 ¶ 24)
IDA has an Employee Handbook that contains various personnel policies. (Dkt. 36 ¶ 21) IDA's "Leaves of Absence" Policy ("Policy") provides, in pertinent part:
Infectious Disease Associates will provide unpaid leaves of absence to eligible employees who are unable to work due to medical, family, educational, military, personal, or workers' compensation reasons. An employee, upon request, may be granted a leave of absence without pay for a period not to exceed 12 weeks, provided such leave is justified and not detrimental to the operation of the office. While IDA is under no obligation to hold the position open while the employee is on leave, every effort will be made to accommodate an employee returning from leave. Refusing an offer of reinstatement will be treated as a voluntary resignation. An employee who does not return to work after 12 weeks of leave may be subject to termination. . . . An employee who foresees a leave of absence must provide at least a 30-day advance written notice of such leave.
(Id. ¶ 44, Dkt. 34-6) Although Winnie did not provide IDA with at least [*6]  30 days' notice, IDA provided Winnie with an eight-week leave, from February 18, 2014 through April 17, 2014. (Dkt. 33 at 7; Dkt. 36 ¶¶ 45, 59)
On March 20, 2014, Winnie's physician released her to return to work with restrictions. (Dkt. 36 ¶ 49) On March 21, 2014, IDA wrote a letter stating that Winnie works as a nurse using "both hands and arms to insert small intravenous needles for daily antibiotic infusions. She also is required to hold and mix syringes with medication and hold the infusion bag for mixing purposes. In her capacity, there is no light duty." (Dkt. 22-1 at 4) IDA also stated in the letter that Winnie could not return to work until she was cleared to use her left hand and arm. (Id.) On April 2, 2014, Winnie provided her doctor with a description of her duties as an IV nurse. (Dkt. 36 ¶ 54; Dkt. 34-2 at 89:22-90:6) Two days later, on April 4, 2014, Winnie's physician signed a note stating that Winnie was not released to return to work and that the expected date of release would be June 9, 2014. (Dkt. 36 ¶ 55; Dkt. 34-12)
On April 17, 2014, IDA Administrator Lori Brand ("Brand") advised Winnie by phone that IDA was eliminating Winnie's part-time position and advised her [*7]  that she was terminated. (Dkt. 36 ¶ 61; Dkt. 37 at 5) Brand told Winnie that IDA needed to hire a full-time IV nurse because IDA's patient census was high and the staffing needs were urgent. (Dkt. 36 ¶ 61; Dkt. 34-2 at 93:13-94:20) Winnie alleges that she offered to return to her former full-time work schedule, but her offer was rejected. (Dkt. 22 ¶ 32) As of her termination date, Winnie had not been released by her physician to return to work as an IV nurse, and she remained under restrictions that prevented her from performing her job at IDA through June 2014. (Dkt. 36 ¶¶ 63-64) On April 10, 2014, a week before notifying Winnie that her position was being eliminated, IDA hired a full-time IV nurse. (Id. ¶ 62; Dkt. 37-9)
On November 23, 2015, after filing a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC and the Florida Commission on Human Relations, Winnie filed this action against IDA. (Dkt. 1) On October 5, 2016, Winnie filed an amended complaint. (Dkt. 22) In the instant motion, IDA moves for summary judgment, alleging that Winnie is unable to demonstrate that she was disabled, that she was discriminated against because of her disability or age, and that IDA's reasons for her termination [*8]  were pretextual. (Dkt. 33) IDA also argues that Winnie has failed to set forth evidence to support her claim of promissory estoppel. (Id.)

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is appropriate when the movant can show there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fennell v. Gilstrap, 559 F.3d 1212, 1216 (11th Cir. 2009) (citing Welding Servs., Inc. v. Forman, 509 F.3d 1351, 1356 (11th Cir. 2007)). Which facts are material depends on the substantive law applicable to the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The moving party bears the burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
Evidence is reviewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Fennell, 559 F.3d at 1216 (citing Welding Servs., Inc., 509 F.3d at 1356). A moving party discharges its burden on a motion for summary judgment by showing or pointing out to the Court that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case. Denney v. City of Albany, 247 F.3d 1172, 1181 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).
When a moving party has discharged its burden, the non-moving party must then designate specific facts (by its own affidavits, depositions, answers to interrogatories, or admissions on file) that demonstrate there is a genuine issue for trial. Porter v. Ray, 461 F.3d 1315, 1320-1321 (11th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). The party opposing a motion for summary judgment must rely on more than conclusory statements or allegations unsupported by facts. Evers v. Gen. Motors Corp., 770 F.2d 984, 986 (11th Cir. 1985) [*9]  ("conclusory allegations without specific supporting facts have no probative value."). "If a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact . . . the court may grant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials . . . show that the movant is entitled to it." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Prima Facie Cases

1. Disability Discrimination
The ADA prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to . . . the discharge of employees." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The FCRA also prohibits disability discrimination, making it unlawful for an employer to "discharge or fail to refuse to hire any individual, or to otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's . . . handicap . . . ." Fla. Stat. § 760.10.2
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she is disabled, (2) she is a qualified individual, and (3) she was discriminated against based upon the disability. Lewis v. City of Union City, 877 F.3d 1000 (11th Cir. 2017) (citing Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Intern., LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014)); see also Collado v. United Parcel Serv., Co., 419 F.3d 1143, 1152 n.5 (11th Cir. 2005). After a plaintiff establishes the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant [*10]  to produce a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 49 n. 3, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)). If the defendant meets this burden, "the presumption of intentional discrimination disappears, but the plaintiff can still prove disparate treatment by, for instance, offering evidence demonstrating that the employer's explanation is pretextual." Raytheon, 540 U.S. at 49 n. 3.
IDA contends that Winnie cannot establish a claim for discrimination under the ADA or FCRA because she was not disabled and was not a qualified individual. Further, IDA asserts that Winnie cannot offer sufficient evidence to convince a jury that the proffered reasons for her termination were a pretext for discrimination.

a. Was Plaintiff disabled?
The ADA defines "disability" as (1) "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more" of an individual's major life activities; (2) "a record of such an impairment;" or (3) "being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Winnie alleges that she was disabled under all three prongs of the disability definition. (Dkt. 22 at 10, 14)
A physical or mental impairment is "[a]ny physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, [*11]  musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin, and endocrine." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h).3 Under the ADA, "major life activities include, but are not limited to caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). When Congress enacted the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), it "reinstat[ed] the broad scope of protection" afforded by the ADA, rejecting the Supreme Court's previously narrowed construction of the ADA. Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008). The ADAAA provided that "disability" be construed "to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of [the ADA]." Id. One of the purposes of the ADAAA, codified in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, was to provide that the term "substantially limits" be construed broadly. Id. An impairment that lasts fewer than six months "can be substantially limiting." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ix). "However, while an impairment need not last for more than six months to be considered substantially limiting, '[t]he duration of an impairment is one factor that is relevant in determining whether the impairment substantially [*12]  limits a major life activity. Impairments that last only for a short period of time are typically not covered, although they may be covered if sufficiently severe.'" Leone v. All. Foods, Inc., 8:14-CV-800-T-27TBM, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107224, 2015 WL 4879406, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 14, 2015) (citing 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App'x).
Here, Winnie alleges that she was disabled because she had a physical impairment that substantially limited her major life activities, including performing manual tasks such as lifting her left arm above her shoulder. (Dkt. 22 ¶¶ 66, 96) As evidence of her impairment, Winnie relies on the post-operative restrictions: no work at all for two weeks following the procedure; no use of her upper extremity from two weeks to eight weeks following the procedure; and only "light duty" from eight weeks to four months following the procedure. (Dkt. 22-2 at 7). However, the evidence in the record demonstrates that Winnie's restrictions were not expected to last for more than four months and she was cleared to return to her position in June 2014. (Dkt. 22-1 at 2; Dkt. 37; 37-13) The record also reflects that Winnie's restrictions applied to one part of her body and were limited to certain activities, such as lifting and overhead use. By Winnie's own testimony, she could [*13]  perform major life activities outlined in the EEOC guidelines both before and after surgery, including caring for herself, performing manual tasks, walking, standing, lifting, bending, going the restroom, and working. (Dkts. 34-1 at 124-27; 34-2 at 62-66) Lifting was the major life activity that Winnie said she could perform before the surgery and could continue to do with her right arm after the surgery. (Dkt. 34-2 at 63) Winnie testified that she could drive after eight weeks. While driving is not listed a major life activity, the activity could be considered significant to Winnie's daily life. Although Winnie was not cleared to return to work as an IV nurse, Winnie conceded that she could have worked at "lots of other places." (Id. at 68) IDA's expert, orthopedic surgeon Dr. Anthony Albert, opined that Winnie was not substantially limited in any major life activity and that her lifting restrictions of her left arm were temporary, "as she was simply under recommended restrictions based upon a rotator cuff protocol." (Dkt. 34-5) The record does not indicate that Winnie's impairment substantially limited a major life activity or that it was sufficiently severe. Thus, the Court concludes that [*14]  Winnie did not produce sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact that she was actually disabled. See Leone, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107224, 2015 WL 4879406, at *7 (granting employer's motion for summary judgment on ADA claim after concluding that plaintiff's eye injury that lasted two weeks was not a disability under the ADA because it was temporary and did not substantially limit a major life activity).
Although Winnie also alleges that she also was disabled because she had a record of disability or was regarded as having a disability, the Court need not determine whether Winnie may proceed with these claims. The Court has found that Winnie failed to produce sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding an actual disability, which necessarily means that Winnie cannot sufficiently produce evidence to raise an issue regarding a record of disability.4 Further, regardless of whether Winnie was regarded as disabled, Winnie has failed to demonstrate that she is a qualified individual under the ADA, as discussed below.5

b. Was Plaintiff a Qualified Individual?
To establish the second element of an ADA discrimination claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she is a "qualified individual with a disability." Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 806, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999). A [*15]  qualified individual is a person "'who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of her job' without jeopardizing patient safety." Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)).
The court must analyze whether an individual is qualified for a job in two steps. First, the court must determine whether the plaintiff satisfies the prerequisites for the position as to experience, skills, education, or applicable licenses. Reed v. Heil Co., 206 F.3d 1055, 1062 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. at 352-53). Second, the court must analyze whether the plaintiff "can perform the essential functions of the job, either with or without reasonable accommodations." Id. Here, there is no issue regarding Winnie's qualifications for the position as an IV nurse. Thus, the Court turns its inquiry to the second step of the qualified individual issue.
The determination of essential job functions is made on a case-by-case basis in consideration of a number of factors. Lewis, 877 F.3d at 1012 (citing D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1230 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). "Courts consider the employer's judgment of whether a particular function is essential . . . ." Lewis, 877 F.3d at 1012. The employer's judgment is not a singularly conclusive factor, although it is entitled to substantial weight. Id. (citations omitted). The court also must consider:
(ii) [*16]  Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job; (iii) [t]he amount of time spent on the job performing the function; (iv) [t]he consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; (v) [t]he terms of a collective bargaining agreement; (vi) [t]he work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or (vii) [t]he current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)(ii)-(vii); see also Lewis, 877 F.3d at 1012-13.
The Parties do not dispute that the essential functions of an IV nurse at IDA include inserting butterfly needles into patients' veins and attending to patients' wounds. (Dkt. 36 ¶ 12) The Parties also stipulate that the job functions require IV nurses at IDA to wrap tourniquets around patients' arms, remove needles from patients' arms while applying pressure, remove and reapply compression stockings, help patients who are unsteady on their feet or in wheelchairs, assist patients out of recliner chairs, carry IV bags and boxes of medications, place supplies on shelves, hold infusion bags and coordinate them with antibiotic vials, screw needles into syringes, mix drugs, and take gloves on and off for each patient. (Id. ¶¶ 12, 13, 47) The Parties agree [*17]  that IV nurses at IDA must regularly use both arms and hands to perform their job. (Id. ¶ 47) Thus, there is no genuine dispute as to the essential functions of the IV nurse position.
Winnie alleges that she could perform the essential functions of her employment position with or without reasonable accommodation. With regard to Winnie's ability to perform her duties without a reasonable accommodation, the Court notes there is no genuine dispute of material fact. Winnie's physician had not released Winnie to return to her position at IDA in April 2014, when her position was eliminated. (Dkt. 34-11; Dkt. 34-12; Dkt. 34-2 at 89:22-90:6) Although Winnie testified that she believed she could have lowered an IV pole with one arm to hang an IV bag, hanging an IV bag was only one task out of numerous tasks that Winnie may have been able to perform without an accommodation. (Dkt. 22 ¶ 43; Dkt. 34-1 at 69:4-15) Winnie conceded that every nurse needs to be able to perform all the job functions of an IV nurse. (Dkt. 34-1 at 78:16-18) Accordingly, because Winnie admitted that her physician had not released her to return to work when she was terminated, the Court finds that no reasonable jury could [*18]  conclude that Winnie could perform her duties without an accommodation.
To determine whether Winnie could perform the essential functions of her job as an IV nurse with accommodations, the Court must analyze the reasonableness of the proposed accommodation. Reasonable accommodations include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). "An accommodation can qualify as 'reasonable,' and thus be required by the ADA, only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). Additionally, the plaintiff bears the burden of identifying the accommodation and establishing that the accommodation enables her to perform the position's essential functions. Id. at 1255-56. If the plaintiff is able to meet that burden, then the defendant-employer may show that the reasonable accommodation would impose an undue hardship. Id. at 1255 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a)).
Here, Winnie alleges that she could have performed the essential job functions if IDA had permitted her to work under the physician's restrictions, restructured her job, or assigned [*19]  her to another position. (Dkt. 22 ¶¶ 43, 79, 90, 109, 120) Winnie alleges that she could perform her essential job functions with brief assistance from another nurse. (Id. ¶ 43) Winnie also claims that she could sit at a desk and work on the computer all day without hurting her arm, so long as she did not raise it. (Id. ¶ 43; Dkt. 34-1 at 72:24-73:3; Dkt. 34-2 at 43:7-10) Additionally, Winnie contends that a four-month leave of absence purportedly rejected by IDA is an accommodation that would have enabled Winnie to return to work and perform the essential functions of the job. (Dkt. 22 ¶ 90; Dkt. 37 at 14)
The Court finds the proposed accommodations are unreasonable for three reasons. First, Winnie was not medically permitted to perform the essential job functions of an IV nurse at the time she was terminated. After Winnie's physician was informed that the essential job functions as an IV nurse required the use of both of hands and arms and that there was no light duty work in Winnie's capacity, Winnie's physician stated that Winnie was not released to work. (Dkt. 22-1 at 4; Dkt. 34-12) In her deposition testimony, Winnie conceded that every nurse must be able to perform all job duties [*20]  of an IV nurse. (Dkt. 34-1 at 78:16-18) Second, there was no light duty assignment for an IV nurse. In addition to IDA's statement that there was no light duty work, Brand, IDA's administrator, also stated in her affidavit that there were no vacant light duty positions at IDA that Winnie could have performed. (Dkt. 34-4 ¶ 33) Winnie agreed, testifying that there were no light duty assignments available in the IV room. (Dkt. 34-2 at 76:3-23) It is well settled that IDA had no obligation to create a "light duty" position, even if Winnie were disabled. United States EEOC v. St. Joseph's Hosp., Inc., 842 F.3d 1333, 1345 (11th Cir. 2016) (citing Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 625-26 (11th Cir. 1998) (under the ADA, employers are not required to create light-duty positions for disabled employees)). Third, Winnie suggests that other nurses could assist with her job duties. However, an accommodation is reasonable only if it enables the employee to perform her job. Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255. "In this vein, the 'buddy system' is not a reasonable accommodation because an employer is not required to reallocate essential functions." Leme v. S. Baptist Hosp. of Florida, Inc., 248 F. Supp. 3d 1319, 1346 (M.D. Fla. 2017) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Additionally, Winnie does not set forth any facts as to what assistance she would have needed from co-workers and how that assistance would have enabled her to perform the essential functions [*21]  of her job.
As stated previously, Winnie bears the burden of proving that an accommodation enables her to perform the essential functions of the job. Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56. Here, Winnie has not carried that burden. Winnie's proposed accommodations that she be permitted to work without using her left arm and hand or that she perform a "light duty" job that was not available are unreasonable as a matter of law. Accordingly, because Winnie failed to prove that she is disabled and that she is a qualified individual, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of IDA on Winnie's disability discrimination claims.

2. Age discrimination
Under the ADEA, it is "unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual . . . because of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). The FCRA also prohibits disability discrimination, making it unlawful for an employer to "discharge or fail to refuse to hire any individual, or to otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's . . . age . . . ." Fla. Stat. § 760.10.6 To establish an ADEA claim, a plaintiff must show through either direct or circumstantial evidence that age was the [*22]  "but-for" cause of the employer's decision. Sims v. MVM, Inc., 704 F.3d 1327, 1332, 1335 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing Mora v. Jackson Mem'l Found., Inc., 597 F.3d 1201, 1204 (11th Cir. 2010)).
As Winnie has provided no direct evidence of discrimination, Winnie relies on circumstantial evidence only to establish her claim. As with a disability claim, an age discrimination claim premised on circumstantial evidence is subject to the burden-shifting framework under McDonnell Douglas. Sims v. MVM, Inc., 704 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668). Under that framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Sims, 704 F.3d at 1332. The defendant must then "articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged employment action." Id. If defendant articulates at least one reason, then the plaintiff has the opportunity to demonstrate that the employer's stated reason was pretext for discrimination. Id.
To establish a prima facie case for age discrimination based on circumstantial evidence when an employer has eliminated a position, the plaintiff must demonstrate that "(1) that she was in a protected age group and was adversely affected by an employment decision, (2) that she was qualified for her current position or to assume another open position at the time of discharge, and (3) evidence by which a fact finder reasonably could conclude that the employer intended to discriminate [*23]  on the basis of age in reaching that decision." Carver v. Gee, 8:10-CV-946-T-27EAP, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90105, 2011 WL 3584341, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 12, 2011); see also Williams v. Vitro Services Corp., 144 F.3d 1438, 1442 (11th Cir. 1998).
Here, IDA contends that Winnie cannot state a prima facie case. Although the Parties stipulate that Winnie was a member of the protected age group and was subject to an adverse employment action, IDA contends that Winnie has set forth no evidence that IDA intended to discriminate based on age. (Dkt. 36 ¶¶ 70, 71; Dkt. 33 at 21)
Winnie alleges that IDA's attitude was that older nurses would need more training on the company's electronic medical records system because of their age. (Dkt. 22 ¶¶ 146, 157) Winnie alleges that she "was essentially told" by Holly Garrett Roberts ("Roberts"), IDA's training manager for the electronic records, that she was "too old to learn the new technology of electric records and that she should resign." (Id. ¶¶ 147, 158) In a deposition, Winnie testified that when she asked Roberts for help with the electronic medical records system, Roberts told her to "just give it up. Don't even bother." (Dkt. 34-1 at 40-41) Winnie asserts Roberts' statement was made around 2012 or 2013. (Id. at 42) Winnie also testified that another nurse, Linda Welch ("Welch"), warned Winnie in 2013 [*24]  to be careful "because [older nurses are] not going to be around because it's too hard to explain the computer to them." (Id. at 40) Winnie states that her supervisor, Padalik, told her to "[b]e careful talking about your age." (Dkt. 34-2 at 153) Winnie contends that Padalik's comments were made in the last few years of Winnie's tenure at IDA. (Id.) Additionally, Gwen Levanti ("Levanti"), one of Winnie's former co-workers at IDA, testified that there were "comments made about older nurses not maybe being as computer-literate as younger ones." (Dkt. 37-1 at 14:1-3) Levanti testified that the statements were in reference to Winnie and possibly others. (Id. at 14:19-20) However, Winnie cites to no evidence in the record that establishes IDA intended to discriminate based on these comments about age or that these comments were related to her termination in 2014. Winnie does not allege and does not offer any evidence that Roberts, Welch, or Padalik were involved in the decision to terminate Winnie. There also is no evidence that the three employees' comments were overheard by or relayed to Brand, the IDA administrator who terminated Winnie. The Court finds that no reasonable jury could find that [*25]  "but for" the comments made by others, Winnie would not have been terminated.
Winnie also contends that Corbin Butler ("Butler"), the person hired for the new full-time position, was a "younger person." (Dkt. 22 ¶ 149) However, there is no evidence in the record of Butler's age. Levanti, who worked with Butler, testified that she estimated Butler to be "somewhere between thirty and forty years old, complete guess." (Dkt. 37-1 at 33:9-11) But Levanti did not cite to any evidence to support her age estimate. Thus, the Court concludes no reasonable jury could determine that IDA intended to discriminate against Winnie resting on guesstimates of Butler's age. Based on the record, the Court finds that Winnie failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to IDA's intent to against her on the basis of age. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of IDA on Winnie's age discrimination claims.

B. Pretext
Even assuming, arguendo, that Winnie met her burden of establishing a prima facie case for either her disability or age discrimination claims, IDA contends that the claims fail because Winnie is unable to prove that IDA's stated reason for terminating Winnie was a pretext for [*26]  discrimination.
To demonstrate pretext, the plaintiff must establish that IDA's proffered reason for terminating Winnie was not the true reason for the termination. Brooks v. County Comm'n of Jefferson County, Ala., 446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir. 2006). A plaintiff must demonstrate "'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.'" Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., 520 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997)).
Here, IDA has produced legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Winnie. IDA stated that it was eliminating Winnie's part-time position in the IV room because the staffing shortage was disrupting operations. (Dkt. 33 at 8) Specifically, the record demonstrates that IDA's patient census had increased significantly, compared to the prior year, especially during the months of February, March, and April 2014. (Dkt. 37-7; Dkt. 34-4 ¶¶ 25) Brand stated in an affidavit that while Winnie was on leave, two of IDA's IV nurses who worked as needed were unable to take additional shifts and two other nurses were working 14 consecutive days. (Dkt. 34-4 ¶¶ 26-27) The staffing shortage, Brand stated, was a significant disruption and would create a "substantial risk to patient [*27]  safety." (Id. ¶¶ 28-29) Thus, she determined that IDA could not continue to hold an open part-time position and decided that a full-time IV nurse should be hired immediately "who could work the hours necessary to meet our staffing requirements and safely treat our patients." (Id. ¶ 28) Therefore, the Court finds that IDA has satisfied its burden of articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Winnie.
IDA asserts that Winnie is unable to demonstrate pretext for discrimination for two reasons. First, IDA argues that Winnie offered no evidence that there was an alternative reason for her discharge that related to any disability. Winnie contends that Brand's reasons were pretextual of age and/or disability discrimination. (Dkt. 37 at 17) Winnie states that Brand did not grant a four-month leave of absence and did not reinstate her after she recovered. (Id.) "A fair inference is Brand capitalized on the rotator cuff surgery to rid IDA of an older employee with potential shoulder problems and is fabricating her reasons for the termination." (Id.) However, Winnie testified that she never had conversations with anyone about needing a four-month leave. (Dkt. 34-2 at 9:15-18) [*28]  Winnie also testified that IDA was not obligated to hold open her position for four months. (Id. at 46:13-23) Winnie does not cite to any evidence in the record that Brand's reasons were implausible or inconsistent. Thus, in light of IDA's legitimate reasons and Winnie's testimony, the Court cannot conclude that a reasonable jury could find that IDA's reasons are not credible.
Second, IDA argues that Winnie is unable to demonstrate pretext because the remarks about age, as discussed above, were made by non-decision makers. In her affidavit, Brand stated that she was the only person who made the decision to terminate Winnie's employment. (Dkt. 34-4 ¶ 31) Brand states she was unaware of any comments made to Winnie regarding her age at the time Winnie was terminated. (Id. ¶ 39) Further, Winnie does not direct this Court to any evidence that Brand made or heard any remarks about Winnie's age. Thus, the remarks by Roberts, Welch, and Padalik, if believed, are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. Barsorian v. Grossman Roth, P.A., 572 F. App'x 864, 870 (11th Cir. 2014) (concluding that a non-decisionmaker's statement had no influence on the managing partner's decision to terminate plaintiff and thus creates no genuine issue of fact); see also [*29]  Alvarez v. Royal A. Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1267-68 (11th Cir. 2010) (finding that a stray remark about Cubans that was not made by the decision makers does not raise a genuine fact issue.).
In her response to the Motion, Winnie contends that IDA terminated her for reasons other than those proffered by IDA. (Dkt. 37 at 17) Winnie argues that, although IDA stated there was a staffing shortage, IDA maintained the same level of staffing after Winnie was terminated. (Id. at 7) However, the evidence does not show IDA ever intended to increase the number of staff. Rather, the record reflects that IDA's decision to address the staffing shortage was to eliminate the part-time position and hire a full-time IV nurse. Thus, the fact that IDA maintained the same staffing level is consistent with its stated reasons for eliminating Winnie's part-time position and is insufficient for a reasonable jury to find that the reasons were pretextual.

C. Promissory Estoppel
Winnie alleges that she should be allowed to return to her job under the theory of promissory estoppel. (Dkt. 22) Generally, "promissory estoppel is the principle that a promise made without consideration may nonetheless be enforced to prevent injustice if the promisor should have reasonably expected the promisee [*30]  to rely on the promise and if the promisee did actually rely on the promise to his or her detriment." DK Arena, Inc. v. EB Acquisitions I, LLC, 112 So. 3d 85, 93 (Fla. 2013). Under Florida law, to establish a prima facie case of promissory estoppel, a plaintiff must prove that there was (1) a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promise and (2) which does induce such action or forbearance, and (3) that injustice can only be avoided by enforcement of the promise. Id.
To establish an actionable promissory estoppel claim, the terms of the promise must be definite and certain. Id.; see also Vencor Hospitals v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, 284 F.3d 1174, 1185 (11th Cir. 2002). Here, Winnie takes issue with the fact that she was not reinstated following her leave. Winnie contends that she provided IDA with her physician's estimated post-operative restrictions. (Dkt. 22 at ¶ 235) These restrictions indicate that: she could not work for two weeks following the procedure; she could not use her upper extremity from two weeks to eight weeks following the procedure; and she would be restricted to "light duty" from eight weeks to four months following the procedure. (Dkt. 22-2 at 2) Winnie alleges that IDA told her that her requested leave pursuant to this schedule would "not be a problem." [*31]  (Dkt. 22 at ¶ 237; Dkt. 34-1 at 129:24-130:15) No more was said, apparently. Consequently, Winnie has failed to demonstrate that the terms of the promise were definite and certain on the issue of reinstatement. See W.R. Grace, 547 So. 2d at 924 (whether justice requires enforcement of a promise depends, in part, "on its definite and substantial character in relation to the remedy sought."). Winnie offers no evidence that her reinstatement was discussed at all, let alone with certainty. In fact, Winnie testified that no one from IDA ever told her she could take a four-month leave and no one told her that IDA would hold her job open for four months. (Dkt. 34-2 at 9:19-24) IDA's written Policy expressly stated that it "is under no obligation to hold the position open while the employee is on leave." (Dkt. 34-6) Winnie's deposition testimony shows she conceded this point. (Dkt. 34-2 at 9:22-10:19; 46:13-23) The Court finds that, in reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue regarding the definiteness and certainty of the terms of the purported promise. At best, any terms of a promise were too indefinite and uncertain to constitute an enforceable promise of [*32]  reinstatement following leave.
A claim of promissory estoppel is also premised on the reasonableness of the promisee's reliance on the promise. W.R. Grace, 547 So. 2d at 924; Leonardi v. City of Hollywood, 715 So. 2d 1007, 1009 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998). Likewise, the promise must be one that the promisor should reasonably expect to induce detrimental action on behalf of the promisee. See Cucinotta V. CVS Pharm., Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160993, 2012 WL 5467524, at *3-*4 (M.D. Fla. 2012) (dismissing plaintiff's promissory estoppel claim because the manager's oral grant of permission could not be characterized as having reasonably induced plaintiff's taking of leave in light of the notice in the employee handbook that he did not have authority to grant such permission).
Here, the reasonableness of Winnie's reliance on and her interpretation of IDA's alleged oral statement—that a leave would "not be a problem"—must be considered in light of the language contained in the written Policy. See 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160993, [WL] at *3-4. Winnie alleges that she interpreted IDA's oral statements regarding her leave, along with the language in the Policy—that IDA "will provide leaves of absences" and "every effort will be made to accommodate an employee returning from leave"—as a promise that her job would be available after the surgery. (Dkt. 22 at ¶ 237) Winnie also contends that she was justified in relying on IDA's oral statements because [*33]  of the language in the Policy. (Id. at ¶ 237) However, as discussed above, the Policy states that IDA is under no obligation to hold an employee's position open while he or she is on leave. (Dkt. 34-6) Winnie testified that she was never told that IDA would hold her job open for four months and that IDA was not obligated to do so. (Dkt. 34-2 at 9:142:19-24; 46:13-23) She also testified that "[i]t was assumed that my position would be there." (Id. at 10:4-9) This assumption is both insufficient to support a claim of reasonable reliance and it is inconsistent with IDA's written Policy, which specified that reinstatement was not guaranteed. The Court finds that there is no genuine issue regarding the reasonableness of Winnie's reliance on IDA's response to her leave request.
Accordingly, because Winnie failed to produce sufficient evidence that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the requisite elements of a promissory estoppel claim, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of IDA on Winnie's promissory estoppel claim.
