UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Currently before the Court are the following four documents: (1) Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, [Doc. 86]; (2) Plaintiff's Notice of Objections to the Affidavit of Dianne Voss, [Doc. 108]; (3) Plaintiff's Notice of Objections to the Affidavit of Laura Alvizo, [Doc. 109]; and (4) Plaintiff's Notice of Objections to the Affidavit of Sharon Smith, [Doc. 110]. For the reasons set forth herein, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 86], be GRANTED.  [*3] Also, the undersigned DECLINES AS UNNECESSARY to rule on Plaintiff's Notices of Objections. [Doc. 108-10].

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff initiated the instant civil action on September 17, 2008, against Cherokee County, Georgia. [Doc. 1]. In a two-count complaint, Plaintiff alleged that: (1) Defendant failed to accommodate her disability and terminated her because of her disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12111 et seq., (Count 1); and (2) Defendant terminated Plaintiff because of her race, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1 et seq. (Count 2). Defendant filed its answer on October 24, 2008. [Doc. 9]. The parties then consented to the dismissal of Plaintiff's Title VII race discrimination claim. [See Doc. 12]. After two extensions, the discovery period ended on July 22, 2009. [See Doc. 33].
Defendant then filed a motion for summary judgment on September 10, 2009, on the grounds that Plaintiff could not establish disability discrimination under the ADA. [Doc. 86]. Plaintiff filed a response on October 14, 2009, [Doc. 106], along with three notices of objections to the affidavits of Dianne Voss,  [*4] Laura Alvizo, and Sharon Smith, [Docs. 108-110]. Defendant then filed a reply brief on November 4, 2009, and a response to the notices of objections. [Docs. 116-17].

II. NOTICES OF OBJECTIONS, [DOCS. 108, 109, 110]
Plaintiff objects to certain statements in the affidavits of Dianne Voss [Doc. 108], Laura Alvizo [Doc. 109], and Sharon Smith [Doc. 110], which Defendant submitted in support of its motion for summary judgment. Defendant opposes these notices of objections, but also contends that even if the evidence were excluded, it would still be entitled to summary judgment. [Doc. 116]. As the discussion that follows demonstrates, summary judgment is warranted even if the disputed statements by these three individuals are excluded from consideration. As a result, the undersigned DECLINES AS UNNECESSARY to make a ruling on Plaintiff's specific objections to the challenged affidavit testimony.

III. MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, [DOC. 86]

A. Facts
 1 
Cherokee County ("Cherokee" or "the County") is governed by a five-member Board of Commissioners ("the Board"). The Board appoints a county manager to run the daily operations of the County. (D P 1). 2 At the relevant period of time in this lawsuit, Jerry Cooper served as the county manager. (See D P 12). Cooper has the authority to appoint and terminate employees. (D P 14).
1. Plaintiff's Employment with Cherokee Prior to the July 2007 Car Accident
Plaintiff began working as Cherokee County's Director of Senior Services on September 20, 1999. (D P 10). As the Director, Plaintiff (1) planned, coordinated, and implemented services and activities of the senior services department, (2)  [*6] monitored the budget, and (3) supervised personnel associated with the program. (D P 11). She had the authority to hire, fire, schedule, train, and discipline personnel working for the Senior Services Department. (P P 2). Plaintiff has a history of anxiety and panic attacks. (D P 16). During her employment with Cherokee, Plaintiff openly talked about her depression, anxiety, and medications. (D P 17).
Plaintiff founded the Volunteer Aging Council ("VAC"), which is a 501(c)(3) non profit organization. (See Plaintiff Dep. at 74; P P 18). The VAC engages in fundraising and receives grants. (P PP 18, 20). It then provides this money to Cherokee County to administer the senior programs and services. For instance, the VAC provided money for purchasing equipment, supporting new programs, paying for Meals on Wheels, and supporting the opening of senior centers. (Plaintiff Dep. at 74-76).
The VAC was run by a volunteer board of directors. (See McMorris Dep. at 90, 96; Plaintiff Dep. at Def't Exh. 23). Plaintiff was the president of the VAC. (Plaintiff Dep. at 231). This gave her the authority to sign, but not write, checks. (Id. at 232). The VAC board had to approve expenditures over $ 500. (Id. at 261).
In  [*7] 2002, Cooper issued a written reprimand 3 to Plaintiff for inappropriate conduct and removed her authority to discipline or terminate employees for three months. (D P 27). The letter of reprimand indicated that Plaintiff had used inappropriate language toward employees. (Plaintiff Dep. at Def't Exh. 14). Plaintiff had been accused of using the words "God Damn" in front of another employee and suggesting to another employee that she take medication to deal with her father's death. (Plaintiff Dep. at 217-18). Cooper also believed that Plaintiff directed angry outbursts toward her employees. (Cooper Dep. at 31).
As of February 2004, Plaintiff's direct supervisor was Dr. Jackie McMorris. (D P 13). McMorris reported  [*8] directly to Cooper and involved him in employee disciplinary actions and other employee concerns relating to McMorris's direct reports. (D P 15).
In 2004, Cooper issued a directive that directors were not to contact county commissioners. (Plaintiff Dep. at 57-58). Shortly after issuing the directive, Plaintiff made an appointment with Commissioner Biello, but she cancelled the appointment. (Cooper Dep. at 36; Plaintiff Dep. at 57). When Cooper learned of the appointment, he yelled at Plaintiff and issued a written reprimand for insubordination in July 2004. (Plaintiff Dep. at 57, Def't Exh. 16; see also Cooper Dep. at 36).
Also in 2004, Cooper learned that Plaintiff brought her dog to the Senior Center. (Cooper Dep. at 37). When Cooper learned that the County did not have insurance coverage for the dog, he issued a written directive informing Plaintiff not to bring the dog to the center. (Id. at 38-39).
Cooper sent Plaintiff an email in April 2005 thanking Plaintiff and her staff for the services that they provided to seniors in Cherokee. (See Cooper Dep. at 59). The email concluded, "I am extremely proud of you and want to commend you for your leadership this past year. Keep up the good  [*9] work." (Id.).
McMorris provided an annual performance appraisal to Plaintiff in August 2005. (McMorris Dep. at 45). Plaintiff received an overall performance ranking of "3+," which indicated that Plaintiff's work was excellent. (Cooper Dep. at 62).
McMorris completed another performance appraisal of Plaintiff in September 2006. (McMorris Dep. at 84). This evaluation like the one from August 2005 rated Plaintiff's performance as excellent. (Id. at 84-87).
In 2006, a VAC board member complained to Cooper about a VAC check signed by Plaintiff. (Plaintiff Dep. at 234; Cooper Dep. at 40). Cooper sent Plaintiff a letter indicating that this activity presented the appearance of a conflict, and he advised her against being in a leadership position with the VAC since it provided money to benefit the Senior Center. (Cooper Dep. at 40-41). The letter also praised Plaintiff for the "wonderful job" that she performed to provide services for seniors in Cherokee County. (See Plaintiff Dep. at Def't Exh. 17). The letter was not a reprimand. (Id. at 41).
Plaintiff received a reprimand on January 5, 2007, from Dr. McMorris for unprofessional conduct and insubordination. (Plaintiff Dep. at 247-48, Def't  [*10] Exh. 19). The unprofessional conduct stemmed from a September 2006 VAC board meeting conducted by Plaintiff while the subordination was based on Plaintiff contacting Cooper on a day McMorris directed Plaintiff not to contact him. (McMorris Dep. at 48-49, 51-52; Plaintiff Dep. at Def't Exh. 19). Plaintiff submitted a rebuttal, which Dr. McMorris actually wrote for Plaintiff. (Plaintiff Dep. at 246). The rebuttal stated in part that Plaintiff would no longer write checks for the VAC. (Id. at 251).
2. The July 20, 2007, Car Accident
On July 20, 2007, Plaintiff left work early. (D P 45). On her way home, Plaintiff was involved in a single car accident. Plaintiff was taken to the emergency room, but released the same day. (D P 46). Cooper and McMorris encouraged Plaintiff to take time off until she was able to return. (D P 47). McMorris also informed Plaintiff that she would have flashbacks and it was okay to be a bit teary and emotional. (McMorris Dep. at 60). Plaintiff returned to work on Tuesday, July 24. (D P 48).
Plaintiff was referred to Cynthia Dorer, a Licensed Social Worker, on August 7, 2007, by Cherokee's Employee Assistance Program ("EAP"). (D PP 50-51). During this session, Dorer  [*11] diagnosed Plaintiff with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ("PTSD") 4 because Plaintiff was suffering flashbacks from her car accident, was experiencing panic attacks, and was not eating or sleeping well. (D P 52). Cooper learned of the PTSD diagnosis in early August. (Plaintiff Dep. at 157).
3. Plaintiff's Employment with Cherokee after the Car Accident
Following the accident, Plaintiff was not able to perform her job one hundred percent satisfactorily. (Plaintiff Dep. at 143-44). "[T]here were aspects that [she] could not do successfully." (Id. at 145). Plaintiff was unable to arrive at work by 8:00 a.m. and instead arrived at work at 8:30 due to lack of sleep, but she would work weekends to make up the time. (Id. at 144). Plaintiff would also have to leave meetings because of diarrhea. (Id. at 152). Plaintiff would cry in her office, which interfered with work. (Id. at 154). Plaintiff would lose her temper. (Id.). The pace of Plaintiff's work slowed, which diminished the time that she had to meet with her employees. (See id. at 322-28). Plaintiff believed that once she informed her employer about the PTSD, her supervisors should have sat down and discussed it with her. (Id. at 277). 5 McMorris did not see a major change in Plaintiff's behavior after the  [*13] accident. (McMorris Dep. at 61).
On September 4, 2007, Plaintiff lost her temper and wrote an email to McMorris in which Plaintiff used "G.D." and made derogatory remarks about volunteer board members of the VAC. (D P 58; Plaintiff Dep. at 257). Plaintiff's profanity was directed at one of the VAC volunteers, Patty Baker, who also served as Cherokee's Clerk of Courts. (D P 58). Apparently, Baker had expressed concerns that Plaintiff was using VAC funds to benefit the County's Senior Services Center without following the VAC bylaws. (See D P 59). As a result, Plaintiff wrote:
I just heard about the visitor to your office regarding Sharon's [Meals on Wheels money.] I am so angry.
. . . . When [is] someone going to stand up for me and my program and tell certain people to discuss this with me present!!!!!!!! The business and banker[s] as well as the grantor[s] know what the money is being spent for[.] WHY cannot anyone get that fact across [] to Patti Baker, WHY [] am I always band and wrong!!!@!!!!!!!~ I am shaking! She is a nut  [*14] case when are people going to say enough!!!! I [] Paulette Haines have brought in the grants and most of the money, NOT Patty Baker!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I want this straighten[ed] out for if this was taken care of properly earlier this year Patty Baker would not think she is so hot! . . . I have followed their rules and she has the GD nerve to go to you! I have had it[,] and I want something done or there will NOT be money raised by me giving specific assurances to donors/grantors, then Patty Baker and lazy Benny Carter running to you or Jerry saying something completely erroneous and I have had it this time! That woman is not going to imply one more darn thing . . . about Di and me.
(Plaintiff's Dep. at 261, Def't Exh. 24).
As a result of this email, Plaintiff's tardiness problems, and Plaintiff's conflicts of interest with the VAC, Dr. McMorris gave Plaintiff a one-day suspension without pay, which was approved by Cooper. (D PP 60, 65). McMorris decided that a one-day suspension was appropriate based on the previous disciplinary action, and McMorris's belief that the prior verbal counseling and write-ups "weren't getting through." (McMorris Dep. at 66).
On September 11, 2007, McMorris and Human  [*15] Resources Director Kay Bruner met with Plaintiff about her behavior and informed her of the one-day suspension. (D P 66). Along with notification of the suspension, McMorris provided Plaintiff with a letter explaining the reasons for the suspension and addressing Plaintiff's tardiness, absenteeism, and VAC conflict of interest problems. (D P 67). McMorris informed Plaintiff that she needed to adhere to the County's 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. work schedule. (D P 68). The memorandum concluded by noting that Plaintiff's failure to comply with the recommendations would lead to further disciplinary action, including termination. (D P 71).
During the meeting with McMorris and Bruner, Plaintiff did not mention her PTSD. Instead, she justified her actions by noting her health and car accident, explaining having grown up in an alcoholic home and having marital problems. (D P 72; Plaintiff Dep. at 272). McMorris offered to allow Plaintiff to take some time off, but Plaintiff declined because she could not afford to take time off without pay. (Plaintiff Dep. at 272). Plaintiff also denied that she was tardy, but said that she would conform. (Id. at 279-80).
Following the meeting, Plaintiff provided  [*16] a written response to her suspension, indicating that she should have obtained VAC board approval and was in therapy for anxiety and anger/frustration. (D P 75). She asked to meet with McMorris to discuss the events at which time Plaintiff believed that it would be appropriate to talk about her needs. (Plaintiff Dep. at 281, Def't Exh. 27).
Plaintiff sent McMorris an email on September 12 in which she asked that her pay be reinstated and that the written warning be reduced to a verbal warning. (Plaintiff Dep. at 284-85, Def't Exh. 29; D P 76). The email stated:
I had put in a call to my therapist yesterday and heard back late. She reminded me of her three initial EAP sessions, [in which] I was told I had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the July 20th, 2007 car accident. I was given the paper work on PTSD and some exercises to do for the panic portion. I was also reminded that points 3 and 4 on the sheet she gave me[,] which are this "3 anger and irritability" and "mood Changes". I quote "angry at the world or feeling anger toward people you love [] and trust. Arguing often with relatives, friends, or co-workers[.]" "Having trouble controlling your emotions. Moods go up or  [*17] down. Going along fine and then suddenly feeling very anxious or upset" [].
The county pays for us to get the help we need and I am grateful, for many persons have looked at me like I got out of that accident without a wound, not true, I have had all the effect from the post stress. I ask you to include this as an appeal to my rebuttal, I have no problem signing a release of information to support me. I ask to have my day's pay reinstated and the written warning reduced to a verbal warning.
I thank you Jackie for [] allowing me this opportunity to give this rebuttal information.
(Plaintiff Dep. at Def't Exh. 29). In this email, Plaintiff believed that she was asking the County for assistance. (Plaintiff Dep. at 338). Plaintiff believes that her behavior should have been overlooked because her PTSD skewed her judgment. (D P 77).
On September 14, 2007, Plaintiff sent an email to McMorris and Cherokee Human Resources employees, in which Cooper was blind copied, blaming the HR employees for sending her an insurance card, which Plaintiff believed she had not requested. (Plaintiff Dep. at 291-93). Plaintiff believed that she wrote the email because of her PTSD. (D P 82). Cooper asked Plaintiff  [*18] to apologize to the HR employees because Plaintiff had signed up for the insurance. (D P 81). Plaintiff believed that Cooper's response was inappropriate because it was seven weeks after the accident, and he never previously had made an issue. (Plaintiff Dep. at 295). In Plaintiff's email apology, which was also sent to Cooper and McMorris, Plaintiff stated in part:
Since the car accident, I have been dealing with PTSD and have felt more anxious at times. I hope you understand. Thank goodness for the county's EAP plan and the help they have afforded me. The EAP counselor I see has pointed out that anxiety is part of PTSD and it will get better.
(D P 83).
After the suspension, Cooper learned that Plaintiff had told other employees about her suspension despite being directed not to disclose the suspension. (D P 84). Cooper also learned that Plaintiff had blind copied an agency director (Amy Davis) on an email, which he believed demonstrated poor judgment. (Cooper Dep. at 91). Cooper further learned that Plaintiff had lifted her skirt at work to show a tattoo to another employee. (Id. at 91-92). Cooper additionally learned that Plaintiff had written an article in a newsletter to senior citizens  [*19] about plastic surgery, which he believed was unprofessional. 6 (Id. at 92). Cooper further learned that an employee under Plaintiff had been involved in a series of accidents and Plaintiff had not taken any action. (See id. at 47, 92).
Cooper decided to fire Plaintiff after learning about this series of incidents in September 2007. In reaching this decision, Cooper examined Plaintiff's past discipline (probation in 2002, written warnings in 2004, 2006, and 2007, and the 2007 suspension), her performance problems, inappropriate behavior, and insubordination, including informing individuals of her suspension when she was directed not to share this information. (D P 93; Cooper Dep. at 89). Cooper considered Plaintiff's continuing misconduct so egregious that he decided to terminate  [*21] Plaintiff without consulting McMorris. (D P 94).
During the meeting to notify Plaintiff of her termination on September 24, 2007, Cooper informed Plaintiff that he lacked faith in her ability to lead the Department due to her poor management and inappropriate conduct, citing her decisions to blind copy county official on emails, and failing to manage multiple vehicle accidents of one of her employees. (D P 95; Cooper Dep. at 49). Plaintiff then appealed her termination, but an administrative law judge denied the appeal on October 22, 2007. (D P 147).
Following Plaintiff's termination, McMorris filled Plaintiff's job on an interim basis from September 2007 to March 2008. (McMorris Dep. at 82). Cherokee then hired Barbara Dobyne, an African-American, for the Director position in March of 2008. (Plaintiff Dep. at 308-10; McMorris Dep. 82).
4. After Acquired Evidence of Misconduct 7 
a. Resume
In Plaintiff's  [*22] resume for the Director of Senior Services position, Plaintiff omitted that she had worked for Luther Ministries of Atlanta for two months prior to receiving the director position. (Plaintiff Dep. at 35). Plaintiff had worked for Luther Ministries for two months in June and July of 1999, but she was fired because her personality clashed with her boss's. (Id. at 35-36). Plaintiff omitted her employment with Luther Ministries on the resume because she only worked there for two months. (Id. at 35). Had Cooper known about Plaintiff's misrepresentation of her job history, he would have terminated her. (Cooper Aff. P 8).
b. AmTech
Plaintiff took a vacation in July 2007 after her car accident to Washington State. (Plaintiff Dep. at 81). As part of her vacation, she went to visit the headquarters of Amtech, which is a company that makes hot-cold trucks used for the delivery of food in Meals on Wheels programs. (Plaintiff Dep. at 76, 78). Plaintiff took a tour of the company and had dinner with the company's vice president, the VP's wife, and Jay Goldsby, a salesperson for AmTech. (Id. at 79). The VAC did business with AmTech and purchased two Meals on Wheels vehicles from the company. (Id. at 174-75).  [*23] After the visit with the AmTech VP, Plaintiff sent flowers to the VP and his wife to thank them. Plaintiff used the Cherokee County credit card to do so. (Plaintiff Dep. at 311). Cooper believed that the trip was funded by AmTech. (Cooper Dep. at 94). He also believed that Plaintiff had acted inappropriately at a conference in which she was representing the County by getting drunk. He further believed that Plaintiff had made inappropriate sexual advances toward an AmTech sales person. (Id. at 93-94).
Cooper testified that he would have terminated Plaintiff had he known about any of these events while Plaintiff was employed by Cherokee. (Cooper Dep. at 94).
c. Telephone System
Plaintiff asked McMorris about purchasing a telephone system for the Cherokee Senior Center. (McMorris Dep. at 120). McMorris instructed Plaintiff not to do so because Plaintiff wanted to make the purchase from a County Commissioner's business. (Id. at 121). Plaintiff then used VAC funds to purchase and install the telephone system. (Id.).
While preparing for Plaintiff's appeals hearing on October 22, 2007, Cooper learned that Plaintiff had purchased the system without approval of the VAC board in violation of its  [*24] bylaws. He also learned that McMorris had instructed Plaintiff not to make the purchase. (Cooper Aff. P 3). Cooper believed that Plaintiff's act constituted an act of insubordination and that she had violated VAC bylaws. As a result, he would have terminated Plaintiff had he known of these infractions. (Cooper Aff. P 4).

B. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue as to any material fact is present, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c). The movant carries the initial burden of "informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those materials that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 232 F.3d 836, 840 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323); see also Burger King Corp. v. E-Z Eating, 41 Corp., 572 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir. 2009) ("[A] party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the . . . court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if  [*25] any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.") (quoting Celotex Corp., id.) (internal quotations omitted). For an issue on which the non-moving party bears the burden of proof, the moving party need only show "that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case." Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1115-16 (11th Cir. 1993) (quotation omitted). "Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
The nonmovant is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, admissions and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324. "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmovant's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "[F]acts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only  [*26] if there is a 'genuine' dispute as to those facts." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007). "When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Id. If the record does not blatantly contradict the nonmovant's version of events, the court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also EPL Inc. v. USA Federal Credit Union, 173 F.3d 1356, 1362 (11th Cir. 1999); Duke v. Cleland, 884 F. Supp. 511, 514 (N.D. Ga. 1995). Summary judgment is properly entered "against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322. "[M]ere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion." Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005).

C. Discussion
Defendant has moved  [*27] for summary judgment on the merits of Plaintiff's ADA claims and on the basis of the after-acquired evidence defense. The undersigned addresses each argument, starting with the merits of the ADA claims.
1. Statutory and Analytical Frameworks for ADA Claims
The ADA prohibits an employer from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such an individual" concerning hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation, training, job application procedures, or "other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). 8 The definition of discriminate includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of a qualified individual with a disability. Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
Defendant uses the McDonnell Douglas framework in arguing that Plaintiff cannot establish a discriminatory discharge claim based on  [*29] her disability. [See Doc. 86 at 19-25]. Plaintiff appears to argue that it is inappropriate to use the McDonnell Douglas framework in analyzing the discriminatory discharge claim because this framework is only employed in Title VII cases. [See Doc. 106 at 13]. Plaintiff's position is incorrect. The Eleventh Circuit has explicitly stated that "[t]he burden of proof for an ADA claim is . . . based on the framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp." Durley v. APAC, Inc., 236 F.3d 651, 657 (11th Cir. 2000); Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007), Bennett v. Dominguez, 196 Fed. Appx. 785, 791 (11th Cir. 2006); see also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 50, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 & n.3 (2003) (reviewing disparate treatment disability claim under McDonnell Douglas framework and noting that courts of appeals use this framework in disparate treatment ADA cases); Richardson v. Honda Mfg. of Ala., LLC, 635 F. Supp. 2d 1261, 1278 (N.D. Ala. 2009). The undersigned therefore applies the McDonnell Douglas framework to the discriminatory discharge claim.
Under this framework, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case under the ADA. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie  [*30] case, the burden of production then shifts to the employer to produce evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating the plaintiff. Once the employer meets its light burden of production, the plaintiff must then show that the employer's reason is pretext for discrimination. Durley, 236 F.3d at 655-56; Bennett, 196 Fed. Appx. at 792.
Although the McDonnell Douglas framework applies to disparate treatment claims under the ADA, the McDonnell Douglas framework is inapplicable in failure to accommodate cases under the ADA. Nadler, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705 at *9 (joining other circuit courts in holding that "McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting [framework] is not applicable to reasonable accommodation cases"); Wright v. Hosp. Auth. of Houston County, No. 5:07-cv-281, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7504, 2009 WL 274148, *7 (M.D. Ga. Feb. 3, 2009) (following Nadler, supra); Alexander v. TFM Boral Brick, Inc., No. 3:07-cv-647, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94414, 2008 WL 4951240, *11 (M.D. Ala. Nov. 19, 2008) (following Nadler despite its status as an unpublished decision because its reasoning concerning the inapplicability of the McDonnell Douglas framework in failure to accommodate cases is persuasive); Jones v. Ga. Dep't of Corrs., No. 1:07-cv-1228, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22142, 2008 WL 779326, *6 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 18, 2008)  [*31] (Vining, J.) (finding that Nadler decision came to "the logical conclusion that the McDonnell Douglas test does not apply to reasonable accommodation claims"); see also Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that in failure to accommodate case that there are no "subsequent burdens on [defendant] to show that it had any legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for terminating [plaintiff] or on [plaintiff] to establish that these reasons were pretextual") (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, a plaintiff establishes a reasonable accommodation claim by proving a prima facie case of disability discrimination. See Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262-63; Nadler, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705 at *9.
Under either a failure to accommodate theory or a disparate treatment theory, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA by showing that: "(1) he has a disability; (2) he is a 'qualified individual;' and (3) the defendant unlawfully discriminated against him because of the disability." McCoy v. Geico Gen. Ins. Co., 510 F. Supp. 2d 739, 748 (M.D. Fla. 2007) (citing D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1225-26 (11th Cir. 2005)); see also  [*32] Rylee v. Chapman, 316 Fed. Appx. 901, 905-06 (11th Cir. 2009) (identifying prima facie case under ADA and then noting that "[a] plaintiff can proceed on theories of intentional discrimination, disparate treatment, or failure to make reasonable accommodations").
With the analytical framework clarified for Plaintiff's two ADA claims, the undersigned examines whether Plaintiff's ADA claims may survive summary judgment. In making this determination, the undersigned evaluates each element of the prima facie case because Defendant has challenged Plaintiff's ability to establish each element.
2. ADA Prima Facie Case
a. Disability
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish that she has a disability under the version of the ADA that was in force prior to January 1, 2009. [See Doc. 86 at 2 & n.1]. First, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff cannot show that she suffered from PTSD at the time of her termination because: (1) Dorer ignored the DSM-IV's 30-day requirement when diagnosing Plaintiff with PTSD; (2) Dr. Marks's PTSD diagnosis did not state with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Plaintiff had PTSD at the time of her termination and only reflected Plaintiff's condition as of  [*33] June 2009; and (3) Plaintiff has no other evidence besides her unsubstantiated opinion. [Id. at 3-4].
Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot show that her PTSD substantially limited a major life activity because she has produced no evidence to even show that the PTSD interfered with the major life activity of work given her testimony that her job performance was not unsatisfactory. [Id. at 5]. Defendant additionally points out that there is no other evidence demonstrating that any major life activities were affected because following her accident, Plaintiff only took one day off work, she went on vacation, her behavior did not change, Plaintiff gave no indication that she was unable to perform her job, and she indicated that she could perform other jobs in development and social services. [Id. at 6-7]. Defendant asserts that the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Johnston v. U.S. Postmaster General, 277 F.3d 1380 (11th Cir. 2001) (Table), 9 demonstrates that Plaintiff's PTSD did not establish that she had a disability under the ADA.
Plaintiff responds by first arguing that she suffered from PTSD at the time of her termination as evidenced by Dorer's and Dr. Marks's diagnoses even if Dorer's initial diagnosis was technically Acute Stress Disorder ("ASD"). [Doc. 106 at 4-6]. She further argues that even if the impairment was improperly identified, the identity of the impairment is not the issue but rather the issue is whether the impairment substantially limited a life activity. [Id. at 6-7]. Plaintiff submits that her impairment affected the major life activity of work because her impairment: (1) led to sleep problems, prevented her from arriving punctually at work; (2) caused uncontrollable diarrhea, forcing her to leave meetings suddenly; (3) led to problems controlling her temper and emotions, which created difficulties with subordinates and superiors;  [*35] (4) impaired her judgment and communications skills; and (5) led to memory lapses and blackouts. [Id. at 7-8].
Defendant counters that Plaintiff cannot rely on Acute Stress Disorder ("ASD") to bring ADA claims because ASD is a temporary, non-chronic condition by definition. [Doc. 117 at 3-4]. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff has no evidence as to when the ASD became PTSD and that Dorer's diagnosis is based solely on subjective criteria from Plaintiff. [Id. at 4]. Defendant finally contends that Dr. Marks's diagnosis is insufficient because it was rendered two years after her termination and omits any attempt to diagnose when it first began. [Id. at 4-6].
Under the ADA, a disability is defined as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). Plaintiff appears to claim that subsection "A" applies to her disability discrimination claims. To establish a disability under subsection "A," Plaintiff must show: (1) she has a physical or mental impairment (2) that substantially limits (3) her ability to  [*36] perform a major life activity. See Collado v. United Parcel Serv. Co., 419 F.3d 1143, 1155 (11th Cir. 2005); Bonner v. Home Depot, 323 F. Supp. 2d 1250, 1259 (S.D. Ala. 2004). Defendant contends both that Plaintiff did not have an impairment at the time of her termination and that even if she had such an impairment, it did not substantially interfere with a major life activity. The undersigned addresses each argument separately.
i. Presence of a Mental Impairment
As the discussion below indicates, the undersigned agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff cannot establish issues of material fact that she suffered from a disability under the ADA. Although the undersigned reaches the same conclusion as Defendant, the reasons for doing so are somewhat different. Unlike Defendant, the undersigned concludes that issues of material fact exist as to whether Plaintiff suffered from any impairment at the time of her termination. To maintain a claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that she is "presently -- not potentially or hypothetically -- substantially limited in order to demonstrate disability," which "means that the person must be substantially limited in a major life activity at the time  [*37] of the discrimination, and not several years later." Garrett v. Univ. of Ala. at Birmingham Bd. of Trs., 507 F.3d 1306, 1312 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 482, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450, (1999)); 10 Stokes v. City of Montgomery, No. 2:07-cv-686, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73889, 2008 WL 4369247, *4 (M.D. Ala. Sept. 25, 2008) ("[T]he limiting symptoms must exist at the time of the adverse employment action in order for the employee to be considered disabled."); Dorsey v. Atlanta Community Food Bank, No. 1:05-cv-3151, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17596, 2007 WL 788936, *3 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 14, 2007) (Story, J.) ("[T]o establish the first element of his prima facie case Plaintiff must show that he had a 'disability' . . . at the time of his termination.").
Based on the Garrett case, Defendant asserts that Dorer's PTSD diagnosis was premature under the ADA and that the only valid PTSD diagnosis came years after Plaintiff's  [*38] termination, thereby preventing Plaintiff from even showing that she suffered any disability at the time of the discharge. The undersigned disagrees. Although Dorer may have erred in diagnosing Plaintiff with PTSD before the DSM-IV's 30 day requirement was triggered, the evidence creates an issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff had PTSD at the time of her termination. First, Plaintiff's symptoms at the time of Dorer's initial diagnosis were consistent with PTSD. Second, there is no evidence that Dorer rescinded her PTSD diagnosis once the 30 day period had lapsed. Third, although the PTSD diagnosis was initially premature, Dorer indicated that Plaintiff continued to suffer from PTSD. Fourth, there is no evidence indicating that Dorer concluded that Plaintiff's condition had improved prior to her termination. As such, the undersigned concludes that issues of material fact exist as to whether Plaintiff suffered from PTSD at the time of her termination despite Dorer's initially premature PTSD diagnosis. Defendant therefore is not entitled to summary judgment on this point.
ii. Major Life Activity
Although Plaintiff has created an issue of material fact as to the PTSD diagnosis, this PTSD  [*39] diagnosis by itself (as both parties agree) is insufficient to establish a disability under the ADA. See Miller v. Fed Ex Corporate Office, No. 3:07-cv-18, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64946, 2008 WL 3020884, *11 (N.D. Fla. July 30, 2008) ("While PTSD is a mental impairment, PTSD, in and of itself, does not necessarily meet the statutory definition of an ADA disability."); Johnston v. Henderson, 144 F. Supp. 2d 1341, 1350 (S.D. Fla. 2001) (same, citing Hamilton v. Southwestern Bell Tele. Co., 136 F.3d 1047, 1050 (5th Cir. 1998)). Instead, Plaintiff must also show that the PTSD substantially limited a major life activity. See Miller, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64946, 2008 WL 3020884 at *11. "Major life activities are [] defined by the [EEOC] as 'functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.'" Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommc'ns., Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)). An individual is substantially limited in performing a major life activity if the impairment "prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives." Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 198, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002).  [*40] 11 A plaintiff proves the existence of a disability by "offering evidence that the extent of the limitation [caused by their impairment] in terms of their own experience . . . is substantial." Greenberg, 498 F.3d at 1264 (quoting Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 198).
Plaintiff claims that the only major life activity that was substantially limited by her PTSD was work. [See Doc. 106 at 7-8]. Defendant contends that the evidence does not support that the major life of activity of work was substantially limited because: (1) Plaintiff testified that she was able to complete her work; (2) she relies on one statement from her husband's deposition; (3) she admits that she is able to work in a wide range of development and social services  [*41] jobs; and (4) she told her therapist that she could work 24/7. [Doc. 117 at 6-7].
"The Eleventh Circuit has consistently treated working as a major life activity." McCoy v. Geico General Ins. Co., 510 F. Supp. 2d 739, 749 (M.D. Fla. 2007) (citing D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1226-27 (11th Cir. 2005)). "'When the major life activity under consideration is that of working, the statutory phrase 'substantially limits' requires, at a minimum, that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in a broad class of jobs.'" Greenberg, 498 F.3d at 1264 (quoting Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 491, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999)). This means that:
an individual's ability to work is "substantially limited" when the individual is "significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working."
D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1227 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i)).
The undersigned concludes that Plaintiff has not provided the necessary  [*42] evidence to create an issue of material fact as to whether she was substantially limited in the major life activity of work. Plaintiff identifies the following evidence as being relevant to her showing that her PTSD interfered with the major life activity of work: (1) inability to sleep; (2) tardiness; (3) uncontrollable diarrhea; (4) difficulty controlling temper and emotions; (5) skewed judgment and communication skills; (6) blackouts and memory lapses; and (7) staring at her computer. [Doc. 106 at 7-8]. This evidence does not show that Plaintiff's PTSD affected her ability to perform a range of jobs. It merely demonstrates how the PTSD affected Plaintiff at work as the Director of Senior Services, which is completely different from showing that Plaintiff was unable to perform a broad class of jobs. Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit has held that a plaintiff's showing that an impairment interferes with a specific job is insufficient to show that the individual is precluded from performing a class of jobs. See D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1227 (holding that it was insufficient for plaintiff to argue that her vertigo interfered with her ability to perform her job because she needed to show that  [*43] she was restricted in her ability to perform a class of jobs). Without any evidence that Plaintiff was unable to work a broad class of jobs, her assertion that she was disabled based on substantial limitations in her major life activity of work is insufficient. Greenberg, 498 F.3d at 1264 (holding that plaintiff did not establish disability where he did not provide evidence of an inability to work in a broad class of jobs); see also Gretillat v. Care Initiatives, 481 F.3d 649, 653 n.5 (8th Cir. 2007) (finding that "absence of affirmative evidence necessary to establish" limitation in major life activity of work prevented plaintniff from showing that she was substantially limited in the major life activity of work). 12 
Plaintiff may be seeking to have the court infer that the problems stemming from her PTSD would preclude her from a class of jobs. Although the undersigned must view the evidence favorably to Plaintiff, he cannot make the inference that Plaintiff may be asking the Court to make because there is no evidence to allow the Court to find an issue of material fact exists. All the evidence shows is that Plaintiff's PTSD created problems for Plaintiff at her job as Director of Senior Services. There is no record evidence for the Court to conclude that the PTSD symptoms prevented Plaintiff from working in a broad class of jobs. The undersigned is not an vocational expert, and therefore cannot evaluate whether Plaintiff's problems stemming from her PTSD preclude her from working a broad class of jobs. Also, Plaintiff has not provided any other evidence for the Court to evaluate whether her limitations from the PTSD substantially limit her from performing work in a broad class of jobs.
Finally, Plaintiff's deposition testimony further  [*45] undermines her claim that she was substantially limited in the major life activity of working. Plaintiff testified that she could perform her job despite some problems after she developed PTSD even with the physical problems stemming from her PTSD. (Plaintiff Dep. at 143-44). This testimony rebuts her assertion that she was unable to perform the major life activity of working. See D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1227 (agreeing with district court's observation that plaintiff's proven ability to work contradicts her claim that she was substantially limited in the major life activity of working); Geoghan v. Long Island R.R., No. 06-cv-1435, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30491, 2009 WL 982451, *14 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2009) (finding that where plaintiff performed job without accommodation for disability, plaintiff could not show substantial limitation in life activity of work). 13 
As a result of the foregoing discussion, the undersigned  [*47] concludes that Plaintiff has not demonstrated that she suffered from a disability under the ADA because she has not shown that her PTSD substantially interfered with the major life activity of working or with any other major life activities. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA claims for discriminatory discharge and disparate treatment be GRANTED. In the event that the District Court disagrees with this conclusion and recommendation, the undersigned turns to the other two elements of the prima facie case, starting with the qualified individual element.
b. Qualified Individual
Defendant argues that even if Plaintiff is disabled under the ADA, she is not a qualified individual under the ADA. Defendant asserts that the evidence demonstrates that she was performing her job satisfactorily, thereby precluding her from establishing the qualified prong pursuant to Williams v. Motorola, Inc., 303 F.3d 1284, 1293 (11th Cir. 2002). [Doc. 86 at 8-9].
Plaintiff responds that she was qualified to perform the essential functions of her position for the following three reasons. [Doc. 106 at 8-9]. First, Plaintiff asserts that she received  [*48] an excellent performance appraisals prior to her accident. Second, Plaintiff asserts that she was well-respected for the work she performed. Third, Plaintiff establishes that her co-workers were shocked by her termination. [Id. at 9]. In its reply brief, Defendant reiterates that Plaintiff must show that she was satisfactorily performing her job. [Doc. 117 at 8-9].
The undersigned concludes that although both parties' arguments miss the mark, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on the qualified individual element of the ADA prima facie case. Defendant's basis for seeking summary judgment is the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Williams v. Motorola, Inc., 303 F.3d at 1293. Defendant's reliance on Motorola at page 1293 of the decision is wrong. The Motorola case involved, inter alia, claims of discrimination under both Title VII and the ADA. Id. at 1288. Defendant's citation to Motorola directs the Court to the discussion relating to the Title VII claims, specifically to the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion that Plaintiff could not establish the qualified element under the Title VII prima facie case because the plaintiff "failed to  [*49] present any evidence that she was performing satisfactorily." [Doc. 86 at 8 (citing Motorola, 303 F.3d at 1293)]. There are two problems with Plaintiff's position.
First, the statement in Motorola relating to the qualifications element does not accurately reflect the law in the Eleventh Circuit. In Vessels v. Atlanta Independent School System, the Eleventh Circuit held that the qualified element under Title VII's disparate treatment analysis prima facie case is established by "show[ing] that [the plaintiff] satisfied an employer's objective qualifications." 408 F.3d 763, 769 (11th Cir. 2005). In reaching this holding, the Eleventh Circuit explained:
A contrary rule, under which an employer's subjective evaluation could defeat the plaintiff's initial prima facie case, cannot be squared with the structure and purpose of the McDonnell Douglas framework. Specifically, we have made clear that the prima facie case is designed to include only evidence that is objectively verifiable and either easily obtainable or within the plaintiff's possession. Walker v. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1192-93 (11th Cir.1998). This permits the plaintiff who lacks direct evidence of invidious intent to force the  [*50] employer to articulate its motives for the challenged employment action so that the plaintiff has an opportunity to show intentional discrimination by circumstantial evidence. Id. If we were to hold an employer's subjective evaluations sufficient to defeat the prima facie case, the court's inquiry would end, and plaintiff would be given no opportunity to demonstrate that the subjective evaluation was pretextual. Such a blind acceptance of subjective evaluations is at odds with the intent that underlies the McDonnell Douglas framework. This is particularly important because we have emphasized that subjective criteria can be a ready vehicle for race-based decisions.
Id. The rule in Vessels does not require a plaintiff to show that she was performing the job satisfactorily to establish the qualified element of the prima facie case. It instead only requires that the plaintiff show that she can meet the objective qualifications of the job. As a result, the undersigned concludes that the Motorola Court's requirement that a plaintiff must show that she performed the job satisfactorily to establish the qualified element is in contravention of Eleventh Circuit case law. 14 Defendant's reliance  [*51] on Motorola concerning Plaintiff's job performance is therefore unpersuasive.
Second and more importantly, regardless of whether Motorola or Vessels provide an accurate description of the requirements of the qualified element in disparate treatment cases, the case law concerning the qualified element in disparate treatment cases is irrelevant on the issue of whether a plaintiff is a qualified individual under the second element of an ADA prima facie because the ADA qualified individual element requires a different showing. The qualified element in the ADA context requires a plaintiff to show that she is an individual  [*52] with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that the individual holds. 15 D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1225 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). As outlined above, the Motorola and Vessels standards for being qualified in disparate treatment cases are very different standards than the standard for meeting the qualified individual element in ADA cases. As a result, courts have determined that the definition of a "qualified individual" for ADA purposes "does not equate to the term 'qualified' as used in the formulations of the prima facie cases for claims of disparate treatment under the ADEA or Title VII." Hawkins v. Dale Med. Ctr., No. 1:05-cv-540, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35522, 2006 WL 1537228, *8 (M.D. Ala. May 31, 2006); see also Rogers v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 18 F. Supp. 2d 1328, 1333 (M.D. Ala. 1998) ("Qualified has somewhat of a different meaning in ADA cases, than it has in Title VII cases."). The undersigned therefore concludes that Defendant's reliance on case law describing the qualified element of a Title VII prima facie case was in error because the Title VII qualified element is not equivalent to the ADA qualified element. 16 
Based on the above discussion, the undersigned concludes that Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment based on its argument that Plaintiff cannot establish the second element of the ADA's prima facie case. 17 As a result, the undersigned turns to the third and final element of the ADA's prima facie case - - unlawful discrimination because of disability.
c. Unlawful Discrimination Because of Disability
The third element of the prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA - - unlawful discrimination based on disability - - is proven in different ways depending on the type of ADA claim. For cases involving a failure to accommodate, this element is proven by showing that the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the disabled plaintiff. See Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262 ("[A]n employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and  [*56] unless the employer can show undue hardship."). For ADA disability claims based on disparate treatment, a plaintiff establishes the third element by showing that she suffered an adverse employment action and that her disability was the determining factor in her termination. See Nadler, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705 at *5. Since the requirements for proving the third element are different for failure to accommodate and disparate treatment claims, the undersigned addresses each claim separately.
i. Failure to Accommodate
Assuming that Plaintiff was disabled and a qualified individual, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a failure to accommodate claim for four reasons. [Doc. 86 at 10]. First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not need an accommodation because she could perform the essential functions of her job in that she testified that her PTSD did not impair her ability to do her job. [Id. at 10-11]. Second, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff never requested any accommodation and instead relies on the untenable position that Defendant should have first approached her about an accommodation. [Id. at 11-12]. Defendant notes that even if Plaintiff relies on the September 12 email as her  [*57] accommodation request, it cannot reasonably be read as seeking an accommodation because it merely is a thank you email. [Id. at 12-13]. Third, Defendant asserts that even if Plaintiff had requested an accommodation, it offered her a reasonable accommodation in the form of providing access to therapy through the EAP program and providing her with the option to take a leave of absence. [Id. at 13]. Fourth, Defendant contends that it was not required to overlook Plaintiff's unprofessional emails and emotional outbursts since such an accommodation was unreasonable and an undue hardship. [Id. at 14].
Plaintiff responds that Defendant had both notice of her impairment and a pending request for an accommodation. [Doc. 106 at 10-13]. As for the notice, Plaintiff notes that she informed McMorris and Cooper of her accident and its effects on her, and she appears to argue that Defendant had a duty to accommodate her once it had notice of the PTSD. [Id. at 10]. As for an accommodation request, Plaintiff states that she "reached out in many ways" for an accommodation in that: (1) she sought therapy through the EAP counselor; (2) she asked her supervisor for help, placing Defendant on notice of a  [*58] needed accommodation; (3) she informed Defendant that she was having trouble coping with the after-effects of the accident; and (4) Defendant did not engage in a dialog with Plaintiff concerning an accommodation. [Id. at 10-12]. Plaintiff additionally appears to argue that Defendant should have engaged in a dialogue concerning an accommodation without prompting because of Plaintiff's performance problems. [Id. at 12]. Finally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant's offer of allowing her to take time off was not reasonable given her status as an agency director and was offered as a threat of discipline. [Id. at 11, 12-13].
Defendant argues in reply that Plaintiff did not establish that she was entitled to an accommodation because she could perform the essential functions of her job. [Doc. 117 at 9]. Defendant next asserts that Plaintiff has not shown that the accommodation would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job. [Id. at 9-10]. Further, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not identified any request for an accommodation. [Id. at 10-11]. Finally, Defendant reiterates that it was not reasonable for Plaintiff to ask the County to overlook her outbursts and unprofessional  [*59] behavior. [Id. at 11].
Since discrimination under the ADA authorizes claims for failure to accommodate a disabled individual, "an employer must make reasonable accommodations that allow a disabled individual to perform her job, unless that accommodation would cause an undue hardship." Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1327 (11th Cir. 1998) (citing Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 519 (11th Cir. 1996), and 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). To establish a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA, an employee must inform his employer that she needs an accommodation. See Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999). This means that "the defendant's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Id.
An employee also is required to prove that the accommodation is reasonable. Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 286 (11th Cir. 1997). An accommodation is "reasonable" if it leads to "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, [thereby] enabling  [*60] a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii). Examples of reasonable accommodations include "[j]ob restructuring [and] part-time or modified work schedules." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). The employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner that she desires, and instead must only provide a reasonable accommodation. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285-86 (11th Cir. 1997).
As outlined above, Defendant raises four arguments in support of its motion for summary judgment on the failure to accommodate claim - - Plaintiff could perform her job satisfactorily; Defendant offered a reasonable accommodations; Defendant was not required to overlook Plaintiff's unprofessional conduct; and Plaintiff never requested an accommodation. Although the undersigned does not agree with the first three arguments, the undersigned ultimately concludes that even assuming that Plaintiff established a disability under the ADA, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim. In making this determination, the undersigned first discusses those arguments  [*61] that he finds unpersuasive before explaining why he agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff never requested an accommodation.
Ability to Get Work Done
The undersigned is unpersuaded by Defendant's argument that Plaintiff did not need an accommodation because she always was able to get her work done. The evidence shows, however, that Plaintiff testified that her PTSD interfered with her work. Initially, the undersigned recognizes that Plaintiff's testimony supports Defendant's argument when she testified:
Q Now, . . . I'm not sure I heard. What part of your job were you doing unsatisfactorily?
A I wasn't doing it unsatisfactory.
Q Okay. So that's what I wanted to be clear. You say that you were doing your job satisfactorily from the time you think you had [PTSD] until your termination; is that correct?
A I wasn't doing it a hundred percent satisfactory, yeah.
. . .
A . . . . [B]ut I would work weekends. I worked - - work was always done.
(Plaintiff Dep. at 143-44). This evidence that she got her work done supports Defendant's argument. See Umble v. Arrowhead Community Hosp. & Medical Center, 8 Fed. Appx. 756, 757 (9th Cir. 2001) (finding plaintiff could not establish failure to accommodate claim  [*62] where plaintiff maintained that her job performance was satisfactory).
However, Plaintiff concedes later in her deposition that there were aspects of her job that she could not do well, testifying as follows:
Q . . . . In your opinion was there some aspect of your job that because of your disability you no longer could do your job successfully? . . .
A Yes, sir, there were aspects that I could not do successfully.
(Plaintiff Dep. at 145). Plaintiff then listed having difficulty with the following: (1) getting to work at 8:00 a.m., (id.); (2) sitting through entire meetings, (id. at 152); (3) keeping focus, (id. at 154); and (4) maintaining her composure, which resulted in crying in her office and losing her temper, (id.). Also, the evidence shows that her supervisors were not impressed with her job performance. McMorris suspended Plaintiff for instances of misconduct, including tardiness, sending an inappropriate email, and failing to improve her behavior. (D P 60). Cooper also was sufficiently dissatisfied with Plaintiff's job performance that he opted to fire her. (Cooper Dep. at 89; D P 93).
Given this evidence that Plaintiff's PTSD affected her work performance, the undersigned is not  [*63] persuaded by Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's testimony about getting the job done demonstrates that she did not need an accommodation. Instead, Plaintiff's testimony about her PTSD interfering with various aspects of her performance creates an issue of material fact as to whether she needed an accommodation. Defendant is therefore not entitled to summary judgment on the failure to accommodate claim based on its argument about Plaintiff getting the job done.
Offer of a Reasonable Accommodation
Defendant argues that its decision to give access to therapy through the EAP and the offer to give a leave of absence were reasonable accommodations. [See Doc. 86 at 13]. "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA . . . only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256. Examples of reasonable accommodations include:
job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations  [*64] for individuals with disabilities.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). As noted, an employer is not required, however, to accommodate an employee in any manner that she desires, but instead merely needs to provide a reasonable accommodation. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86.
The undersigned is not persuaded by Defendant's argument that the EAP counseling and the offer of a leave of absence were reasonable accommodations. As for EAP counseling, there is no evidence in the record as to what the essential functions of Plaintiff's job were, so there is no corresponding evidence that the EAP counseling would enable plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her job. As a result, the undersigned concludes that Defendant has not shown that the evidence of EAP counseling creates an absence of an issue of material fact as to whether the counseling was a reasonable accommodation. Cf. Walsted v. Woodbury County, IA, 113 F. Supp. 2d 1318, 1333 (N.D. Iowa 2000) (finding mere referral to EAP was unreasonable accommodation where there was no evidence, inter alia, that EAP could have provided meaningful counseling). Additionally, the undersigned notes that Plaintiff made use of the EAP therapy, but Defendant  [*65] remained dissatisfied with her job performance, suggesting that this accommodation would not allow Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her job.
The undersigned concludes that the same problem arises with Defendant's argument that its offer of a leave of absence was a reasonable accommodation, namely without evidence of the essential functions of Plaintiff's job, the undersigned cannot discern whether a leave of absence would allow Plaintiff to perform these essential functions. The undersigned recognizes that the Eleventh Circuit has recognized that a leave of absence is a reasonable accommodation in some cases. See Moore v. Accenture, LLP, No. 06-15650, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 26275, 2007 WL 3313152, *3-4 (11th Cir. Nov. 9, 2007); Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003) (noting that "a leave of absence might be a reasonable accommodation in some cases," but holding that an indefinite leave of absence was not reasonable). Here, the Court has insufficient evidence to evaluate whether the offer of a leave of absence would allow Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her job and hence whether such an offer was a reasonable accommodation. Defendant therefore has not met its initial burden  [*66] of showing an absence of material fact on this issue. As a result, the undersigned is unpersuaded by Defendant's argument that it is entitled to summary judgment because it offered Plaintiff reasonable accommodations.
Unprofessional Behavior
Defendant argues that there was no reasonable accommodation that it could have provided to Plaintiff because Plaintiff's PTSD prevented her from controlling her emotions and the ADA does not protect against emotional outbursts. [Doc. 86 at 14]. The undersigned agrees with Defendant that it did not need to provide any accommodation for Plaintiff's unprofessional emails or other outbursts. As the court in Hamilton v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, 136 F.3d 1047, 1052 (5th Cir. 1998), observed, "the ADA does not insulate emotional or violent outbursts blamed on an impairment." See also Bonneville v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, 221 F.3d 1341 (Table), [published in full-text format at 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 11905] 2000 WL 688226, *1 (8th Cir. 2000) ("[A]nti-discrimination statutes do not insulate an employee from discipline for violating the employer's rules or disrupting the workplace[.]") (quoting Kiel v. Select Artificials, Inc., 169 F.3d 1131, 1136 (8th Cir. 1999)); Chrouser v. DePaul Univ., No. 95-cv-7363, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8179, 1998 WL 299426, *5 (N.D. Ill. May 20, 1998) [*67]  (noting that it is not a reasonable accommodation to require employer to alter "its standard of performance of certain essential functions"); cf. Calef v. Gillette Co., 322 F.3d 75, 87 (1st Cir. 2003) ("[T]he ADA does not require that an employee whose unacceptable behavior threatens the safety of others be retained, even if the behavior stems from a mental disability."). 18 However, Plaintiff's PTSD did not solely manifest itself in emotional outbursts. According to Plaintiff, her PTSD interrupted her sleeping and slowed the pace of her work. (Plaintiff Dep. at 145, 152, 154). Thus, the undersigned concludes that Defendant's argument about Plaintiff's outbursts does not require that summary judgment be granted in its favor on the failure to accommodate claim because other facets of Plaintiff's PTSD created problems for Plaintiff at work and therefore could presumably have been accommodated.
Requesting an Accommodation
The Eleventh Circuit requires that a plaintiff request an accommodation before she can prevail on a failure to accommodate claim. Gaston, 167 F.3d at 1364. The Eleventh Circuit has not "determined precisely what form the request must take," but it has suggested the plaintiff's burden is not onerous. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1261 n.14. The EEOC Compliance Manual, which the Holly case cited as providing examples of accommodation requests, has furnished the following examples as being sufficient to request an accommodation:
[(1)] . . . . An employee tells her supervisor, "I'm having trouble getting to work and my scheduled starting time because of medical treatments I'm undergoing." . . . .
[(2)] . . . . An employee tells his supervisor, "I need six weeks off to get treatment for a back problem."
EEOC Compliance Manual at Question 1. However, if a plaintiff never requests a specific accommodation, she cannot establish a failure to accommodate claim. Todd v. McCahan, 158 F. Supp. 2d 1369, 1380 (N.D. Ga. 2000) (Camp, J.).
The undersigned concludes that Plaintiff has not created an issue of material fact  [*69] that she requested an accommodation. First, to the extent that Plaintiff argues that Defendant's knowledge of her PTSD automatically triggered a duty to provide a reasonable accommodation, the undersigned is unpersuaded. [See Doc. 106 at 10]. As the case law outlined above indicates, the Eleventh Circuit requires that a plaintiff first request an accommodation. Gaston, 167 F.3d at 1364. Thus, Defendant's knowledge of her disability does not mean that it had to accommodate Plaintiff on its own initiative.
Second, Plaintiff's argument that she requested an accommodation by using the EAP program is unpersuasive. There is no evidence that use of an EAP program would place Defendant on notice that Plaintiff needed an accommodation. As a result, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiff's use of the EAP program did not constitute notice that Plaintiff needed an accommodation. See Bonieskie v. Mukasey, 540 F. Supp. 2d 190, 202-03 (D.D.C. 2008) (rejecting plaintiff's contention that use of counseling from EAP program placed employer on notice that plaintiff needed an accommodation).
Third, the undersigned is unpersuaded by Plaintiff's apparent argument that Defendant should have initiated a discussion  [*70] about accommodations given her performance problems. The case Plaintiff cites for this proposition - - Fussell v. Georgia Ports Authority - - does not actually support it. 906 F. Supp. 1561, 1569-70 (S.D. Ga. 1995). The Fussell Court stated that "the ADA claimant, who is in the best position to know what accommodation is needed, must request a reasonable accommodation at the time the disability in question presents a problem on the job." Id. at 1570. Thus, Fussell, consistent with subsequent Eleventh Circuit cases including Gaston, supra, requires Plaintiff to request an accommodation.
Fourth, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiff has not created an issue of material fact that she requested an accommodation through her arguments that she informed Defendant about having trouble with the aftereffects her accident or asked McMorris for help. [Doc. 106 at 10]. Without pointing to specific language, Plaintiff identifies exhibits 24, 28, 29 in Cooper's deposition, exhibits 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31 in McMorris's deposition, and exhibits 27 and 29 in her deposition as evidence that she provided notice of her request for an accommodation. [Id. (citing P PP 49, 52, 56)]. By failing  [*71] to cite to specific statements that may be construed as requests, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiff has not created an issue of material fact that she in fact made a specific demand for an accommodation. It is not the undersigned's duty to sift through these documents and find a statement that can be construed as a request for an accommodation and then explain why such a statement constitutes a request for an accommodation. See Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995) ("There is no burden upon the district court to distill every potential argument that could be made based upon the material before it on summary judgment."); 2025 Emery Highway, L.L.C. v. Bibb County, Ga., 377 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1333 (M.D. Ga. 2005) ("While such evidence may exist, it is surely not the duty of this Court to scour the record in an attempt to locate evidence which may raise a material question of fact on summary judgment."). 19 
Additionally, the undersigned's independent review of these documents, even when construed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, has not uncovered any evidence that she requested an accommodation. As for Exhibit 27 in Plaintiff's deposition, this is a rebuttal by Plaintiff to her one-day suspension in which she: (1) asks for a chance to redeem herself; (2) states that the suspension is a financial hardship; (3) reports that her tardiness does not account for the unpaid work that she performs; and (4) mentions her personal and professional anxiety over the years. (Plaintiff Dep. at Def't Exh. 27). It is unclear how this exhibit is evidence of a request for an accommodation.
Exhibit 29 from Plaintiff's deposition likewise does not demonstrate that Plaintiff was requesting an accommodation. In this exhibit, Plaintiff  [*73] sent an email to McMorris in which she informed McMorris that: (1) she had called her therapist; (2) she was diagnosed with PTSD; (3) she was grateful for the help from the County; (4) she has had "all the effect" from the PTSD; and (5) she asked to have her pay reinstated and the written warning reduced to a verbal warning. (Plaintiff Dep. at Def't Exh. 29). The undersigned agrees with Defendant that read in context, this email is merely an additional rebuttal to the suspension without pay. It is unclear what information could be construed as an accommodation request.
The exhibits from Cooper's deposition also do not reveal a request for an accommodation. As for Exhibit 24, this is merely an email that Cooper sent to Plaintiff following her accident. (See Cooper Dep. at 74, Exh. 24). It is not clear how an email by Cooper a few days after her accident before she was diagnosed with PTSD would constitute a request for an accommodation. Exhibit 28 from Cooper's deposition is an email from Plaintiff to Cooper (and others) in which she indicates that she will apologize to HR about the insurance card misunderstanding and she states that she has been more anxious since the car accident and  [*74] there was no disrespect. (Cooper Dep. at 81-82, Exh. 28). It is not clear how this apology email requests some sort of accommodation from Cooper. Further, Exhibit 29 from the Cooper deposition is an apology email that was directed to HR employees but also one in which Cooper was copied. Plaintiff noted that her PTSD had made her anxious but that her counselor had noted that the anxiety would get better. (Cooper Dep. at 82, Exh. 29). This apology email to two individuals who were not Plaintiff's supervisors and who have not been shown to have the authority to grant accommodations does not constitute a request for an accommodation.
The undersigned is not persuaded that the exhibits from McMorris's deposition - - 21, 22, 24-27, 29, and 31 - - create an issue of material fact that Plaintiff requested an accommodation. Exhibit 21 contains an email from McMorris stating, "U [sic] will have flashbacks for a while and it's ok [sic] to be a bit teary and emotional." This email was in response to one by Plaintiff to Cooper in which Plaintiff described her injuries from the car accident, stated that the shock had just hit her, and noted that she wanted to return to work and be kept busy. (See  [*75] McMorris Dep. at Pl. Exh. 21). Given that Plaintiff had not returned to work, expressed a desire to work, and had not made a request for any sort of help at work, the undersigned concludes that it does not create an issue of material fact that she sought an accommodation.
Exhibit 22 contains an email exchange between Plaintiff and McMorris in which Plaintiff noted that she had not been herself "completely" and that she was "trying to get well emotionally." (See McMorris Dep. at Pl. Exh. 22). The context of these statements were made in condolences that Plaintiff sent to McMorris following the death of McMorris's uncle. (See id.). Again, Plaintiff's statements about her own emotional health, which were not tied in any way to problems with her job, do not constitute a request for an accommodation, particularly as expressed in condolence emails.
Exhibits 24 and 25 are summaries of a meeting between McMorris and Plaintiff in which Plaintiff was informed that she was suspended, and Exhibit 26 is Plaintiff's rebuttal letter about her suspension. (See McMorris Dep. at 67-68, Pl. Exhs. 24-26). These exhibits indicate that during the meeting, Plaintiff mentioned that: (1) she was having a bad  [*76] year because of her marriage, her health, and her car accident; (2) she was in therapy for anxiety and anger/frustration issues; (3) she believed that she was protected because of the counseling. (See McMorris Dep. at Pl. Exhs. 24-26). Plaintiff's statements about her counseling and anger problems do not indicate that she requested a work accommodation. As discussed above, the ADA does not protect Plaintiff for her emotional outbursts. See Hamilton, 136 F.3d at 1052. Also, that Plaintiff asked that she be given an opportunity to redeem herself does not suggest that she requested an accommodation. (See McMorris Dep. at Exh. 26). As such, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiff has not created an issue of material fact that she requested an accommodation through Exhibits 24, 25, and 26 of her deposition.
Exhibits 27 and 31 in the McMorris deposition correspond to Exhibit 28 in Cooper's deposition and Exhibit 29 from Plaintiff's deposition. These exhibits were discussed above, so the undersigned will not repeat why they do not create an issue of material fact that Plaintiff requested an accommodation.
Since exhibits 21-22, 24-27, and 31 have been considered, the undersigned turns to exhibit  [*77] 29. This exhibit is an email from Plaintiff to Bruner and McMorris in which Plaintiff states that she is withdrawing the appeal of her suspension because the problems with her knee and her PTSD would only add to her misery. (See McMorris Dep. at Pl. Exh. 29). The undersigned does not see how this email serves as a request for an accommodation because of her PTSD in that it does not seek assistance with her job. As a result, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiff's evidence of accommodation requests do not create an issue of fact that she sought an accommodation.
Finally, since Plaintiff has not demonstrated that she requested an accommodation, the undersigned is not persuaded by Plaintiff's arguments concerning Defendant's failure to engage in the interactive process. The Eleventh Circuit has indicated that an employer does not have to engage in an interactive process where a plaintiff does not identify a reasonable accommodation. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367; see also Webb v. Donley, 347 Fed. Appx. 443, 2009 WL 2914285, *2 (11th Cir. 2009) ("[I]f the employee does not identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer does not have to enter into an interactive dialogue or show undue  [*78] hardship."). As a result, there was no error in Defendant's failure to engage in the interactive process.
Based on the above discussion, the undersigned concludes that even if Plaintiff were disabled under the ADA, her failure to accommodate claim cannot survive summary judgment because she has not created an issue of material fact that she requested an accommodation. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED in Plaintiff's favor even if she could establish that she had a qualifying disability under the ADA. 20 
ii. Disparate Treatment
When a plaintiff raises disability discrimination claims based on disparate treatment, she establishes the third element of the prima facie case - - unlawful discrimination based on disability - - by showing:
(1) that  [*79] [s]he was subject to an adverse employment action, 21 (2) that [s]he was qualified for the job at the time, (3) that [her] employer knew at the time of the action that the plaintiff had a disability, and (4) that the adverse action took place in circumstances raising a reasonable inference that the plaintiff's disability was a determining factor in the decision.
See Nadler, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705 at *5. 22 Defendant asserts that Plaintiff cannot establish the second and fourth elements, so these elements are addressed separately below. Before turning to these arguments, the undersigned first responds to Plaintiff's arguments that they are inapplicable to a disparate treatment analysis for ADA claims. [See Doc. 106 at 13].
The undersigned is unpersuaded by Plaintiff's unsupported position. First, the undersigned has rejected Plaintiff's apparent challenge to the applicability of the McDonnell Douglas framework in ADA cases as outlined above. See Part III.C.1, supra.
Second, to the extent that Plaintiff asserts that the elements of a prima facie case for a Title VII discriminatory discharge claim are irrelevant to a discriminatory discharge claim under the ADA, the undersigned likewise rejects this argument. As the Nadler case, supra, demonstrates, 23 Defendant's arguments concerning Plaintiff's qualifications and her evidence of discrimination are relevant as part of the undersigned's inquiry into whether the plaintiff suffered unlawful discrimination because of her disability.
Qualified  [*81] for the Job
Defendant appears to argue that because Plaintiff was not qualified under the qualified individual element of the ADA prima facie case, she was not qualified under the qualified element for the disparate treatment framework. [See Doc. 86 at 15]. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff was not qualified because of her unprofessional conduct, which precluded her from performing her job. [Id.]. Plaintiff has not responded because she erroneously contends that Defendant's arguments relying on Title VII arguments are misguided. [See Doc. 106 at 13].
Although Plaintiff's position is wrong, Defendant's two arguments relating to qualifications do not warrant that summary judgment be granted in its favor. As for Defendant's attempt to equate the qualified element under consideration for the disparate treatment analysis with the qualified individual element of the ADA prima facie case, the undersigned has determined in Part III.C.2.b supra, that the two standards are not equivalent. 24 As for Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's shortcomings in her job performance rendered her unqualified, this argument contradicts established Eleventh Circuit case law concerning the proper showing for  [*82] whether an individual is qualified for her job. As stated in Part III.C.2.b. supra, an individual is qualified if she meets the "objective qualifications" of the job. Vessels, 408 F.3d at 769. Defendant's argument concerning Plaintiff's shortcomings is essentially a subjective evaluation of her job performance, which is appropriately reviewed at the pretext stage, not at the prima facie stage of the ADA disparate treatment claim. See id. ("If we were to hold an employer's subjective evaluations sufficient to defeat the prima facie case, the court's inquiry would end, and plaintiff would be given no opportunity to demonstrate that the subjective evaluation was pretextual. Such a blind acceptance of subjective evaluations is at odds with the intent that underlies the McDonnell Douglas framework."). As such, Defendant's arguments about Plaintiff's shortcomings are insufficient to establish the absence of an issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff was qualified for her position. 25 
Since Defendant's arguments as to the qualified argument are unpersuasive, the undersigned concludes that Defendant has not met its initial burden on summary judgment and therefore is not entitled to summary judgment on the basis that Plaintiff was not qualified for her position as the Director of Senior Services. As such, the undersigned moves to the fourth element - - whether circumstances raise an inference that Plaintiff's termination was due to her disability.
Circumstances Raise an Inference that Plaintiff's  [*84] Disability Motivated Decision
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot show that similarly situated employees outside her protected class were treated more favorably so as to establish the fourth element of the prima facie case. [Doc. 86 at 15-17]. Defendant notes that Plaintiff has failed to identify any comparators who engaged in similar misconduct and there is no record evidence of such employees. [Id. at 16]. Plaintiff rejects this line of analysis on the basis that this type of Title VII-like analysis does not apply to ADA cases. [See Doc. 106 at 13]. Defendant replies that Plaintiff has abandoned any argument concerning causation because she failed to address the issue in her brief. [Doc. 117 at 13].
An argument that individuals who were not disabled were treated more favorably "is one way of proving discriminatory intent" for a disparate treatment ADA claim under the fourth element of the ADA's prima facie case. See Wright, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7504, 2009 WL 274148 at *12. In situations involving misconduct, a person is similarly situated to a plaintiff if "the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways." McCann v. Tillman, 526 F.3d 1370, 1373 (11th Cir. 2008)  [*85] (quoting Burke-Fowler v. Orange County, Fla., 447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir. 2006)). This means that "the quantity and quality of the comparator's misconduct [must] be nearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing employers' reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges." Id. (quoting Burke-Fowler, 447 F.3d at 1323).
The undersigned concludes that although Plaintiff's basis for opposing Defendant's arguments is wrong, Defendant's arguments in its initial brief do not establish that it is entitled to summary judgment because it did not meet its initial burden on summary judgment. Defendant's summary judgment brief faults Plaintiff for not identifying any alleged comparators and notes an absence of record evidence without actually citing to any evidence. Plaintiff bears the burden of proof on this element at trial, but Defendant's burden on summary judgment requires it to make one of the following two showings: (1) "point [] out to the district court [] that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case; or (2) "with affirmative evidence demonstrat[e] that the non-moving party will be unable to prove its case at trial." Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1116.  [*86] Defendant's brief clearly does not identify any affirmative evidence concerning a lack of similarly situated comparators. [Doc. 86 at 16].
As for identifying an absence of evidence, Defendant has indeed argued that there is an absence of evidence. [Id.]. But, this statement by itself is insufficient to meet Defendant's burden. Instead, Defendant must "by reference to materials on file [show] that there are no genuine issues of material fact that should be decided at trial." Clark v. Coates & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991) (emphasis added). Therefore, Defendant "must point to specific portions of the record in order to demonstrate that the nonmoving party cannot meet its burden of proof at trial." United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop. in Greene and Tuscaloosa Counties in the State of Alabama, 941 F.2d 1428, 1438 n.19 (11th Cir. 1991) (en banc). Defendant's brief does not identify anywhere in the record that there is a lack of evidence to show that Plaintiff cannot identify similarly situated individuals. By way of example, Defendant could have disposed of this burden by, inter alia, identifying deposition testimony or interrogatory responses in which Plaintiff was  [*87] unable to identify any similarly situated individuals. Defendant has not made any such showing. Instead, Defendant relies on conclusory assertions, which do not allow it to meet its initial summary judgment burden. 26 
Since Defendant's two arguments relating to the prima facie case do not dispose of its initial summary judgment burden, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on this element of the basis that there is no evidence of causation to prove an ADA discriminatory  [*88] discharge claim. As a result, the undersigned turns to the remaining facets of the McDonnell Douglas framework, starting with whether Defendant has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff.
3. Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason
Defendant asserts that even if Plaintiff had established a prima facie case for the ADA discharge claim, it has provided legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for her termination. [Doc. 86 at 17-20]. Specifically, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's past misconduct combined with Plaintiff's continued misconduct following her one-day suspension provided Cooper with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff. [Id. at 17-19]. Since Plaintiff protests Defendant's use of the McDonnell Douglas framework, Plaintiff does not address whether Defendant met its burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. [See Doc. 106 at 13]. Without any opposition from Plaintiff, the undersigned concludes that Defendant met its legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her. To the extent that Plaintiff intended to challenge whether Defendant has produced a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the undersigned  [*89] concludes that it has met its burden for the reasons that follow.
Before explaining this conclusion, the undersigned outlines the relevant case law. If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, she has created an inference of discrimination, and the defendant has the burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004); see also McCann, 526 F.3d at 1373. To establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to rebut a plaintiff's prima facie case, an employer "must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the plaintiff's rejection." Joshi v. Fla. State Univ. Health Ctr., 763 F.2d 1227, 1235 (11th Cir. 1985). Thus, although this burden on the defendant is light, the defendant does not "satisfy this burden by mere argument." See Steger v. Gen. Elec. Co., 318 F.3d 1066, 1075 (11th Cir. 2003) (citing Payne v. McLemore's Wholesale & Retail Stores, 654 F.2d 1130, 1144 (5th Cir. Unit A Sept. 1981)); see also Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255 n.9, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981) ("[T]he defendant cannot meet its burden merely through  [*90] an answer to the complaint or by argument of counsel."). Instead, the defendant must "produce admissible evidence which would allow the trier of fact to conclude that the employment decision had not been motivated by discriminatory animus." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 257. This means that the defendant's explanation for its reasons "must be clear and reasonably specific." Id. at 258. In other words, the defendant "must present specific evidence regarding the decision-maker's actual motivations with regard to each challenged employment decision." Walker v. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1181 n.8 (11th Cir. 1998) (emphasis added) (citing IMPACT v. Firestone, 893 F.2d 1189 (11th Cir. 1990)). "[A] court may not assume, based on its own perusal of the record, that the decision-maker in a particular case was motivated by a legitimate reason when the defendant has offered none." Id.
The undersigned notes that the Defendant's articulation of a reason is supported by the evidence. Specifically, Defendant's reason is supported by admissible evidence, which shows that once Cooper learned of a series of inappropriate acts following Plaintiff's suspension and then reviewed Plaintiff's disciplinary history, he  [*91] decided to terminate Plaintiff. (See Cooper Dep. at 47-48, 90-92). There can be no dispute that Cooper's reason is legitimate and nondiscriminatory. Cf. Richardson v. JM Smith Corp., 473 F. Supp. 2d 1317, 1335 (M.D. Ga. 2007) (noting that continued violation of policy was legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason). With the identification of admissible evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, Defendant has met its burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. The undersigned therefore turns to the issue of pretext.
4. Pretext
Defendant finally argues that Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons were pretext for discrimination. [Doc. 86 at 20-23]. First, Defendant asserts that proximity between Cooper learning of Plaintiff's PTSD and Cooper's decision to terminate Plaintiff is not evidence of pretext because a series of intervening events breaks any inference of causation. [Id. at 20-21]. Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's positive performance evaluations are not evidence of pretext because the conduct for which Plaintiff was terminated occurred after the evaluations and Cooper, the decisionmaker, was not the individual  [*92] who performed the evaluations. [Id. at 21-22]. Finally, Defendant argues that because it is undisputed that Plaintiff engaged in the misconduct, she cannot now complain that the discipline imposed (termination) was too harsh because such a dispute will not establish pretext. Plaintiff has not discussed this element because she does not believe that the McDonnell Douglas framework applies to ADA cases. [See Doc. 106 at 13]. Defendant replies that the record as a whole fails to demonstrate that its reason for terminating Plaintiff was pretext. [Doc. 117 at 13].
To demonstrate pretext, the plaintiff must provide evidence that "reveal[s] 'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its actions that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.'" Vessels, 408 F.3d at 771 (quoting Cooper v. Southern Co., 390 F.3d 695, 725 (11th Cir. 2004)). "[T]o avoid summary judgment [the plaintiff] must introduce significantly probative evidence showing that the asserted reason is merely a pretext for discrimination." Brooks v. County Comm'n of Jefferson County, Ala., 446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir. 2006)  [*93] (quoting Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 990 F.2d 1217, 1228) (11th Cir. 1993) (emphasis added)).
The undersigned concludes that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment. Defendant's brief meets its initial burden on summary judgment of showing an absence of material fact on the issue of pretext because it has provided persuasive arguments supported by record citations that Plaintiff cannot establish pretext. [See Doc. 86 at 20-23]. With its initial burden met, Plaintiff, who has the burden of establishing pretext at trial, now has the burden of either: (1) showing that "the record in fact contains supporting evidence, sufficient to withstand a directed verdict motion, which was 'overlooked or ignored' by the moving party, who has thus failed to meet the initial burden of showing an absence of evidence"; or (2) "com[ing] forward with additional evidence sufficient to withstand a directed verdict motion at trial based on the alleged evidentiary deficiency." Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1116 (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 332 (Brennan, J., dissenting)). Plaintiff has not come forward with significantly probative evidence to demonstrate that Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is  [*94] pretext for discrimination. Instead, Plaintiff has taken the erroneous position that the McDonnell Douglas framework has no application in ADA cases. Since the undersigned has concluded that the McDonnell Douglas framework applies to ADA disparate treatment claims, Plaintiff needed to provide evidence of pretext to survive summary judgment. Without such evidence, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's discriminatory discharge claim under the ADA.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that if the District Court finds that Plaintiff suffered from a disability, Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the discriminatory discharge claim be GRANTED. If the District Court concludes that either of Plaintiff's ADA claims survive summary judgment, the undersigned turns to whether after-acquired evidence should limit any recovery by Plaintiff.
5. After-Acquired Evidence 27 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's damages must be limited because it learned of the following inappropriate acts after Plaintiff's termination, which would have subjected Plaintiff to termination: dining with the Vice President of a company with which Cherokee does business, using the Cherokee credit card to send a flower arrangement to the VP, using the Cherokee email system to send emails of a sexual nature, continuing conflict of interest with the VAC, and misrepresenting her job history on her resume. [Doc. 86 at 23-24]. Based on this after acquired evidence, Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot obtain reinstatement, front pay, or complete back pay as relief for any ADA violation because these events, if known, would have led to Plaintiff's termination. [Id. at 24-25].
Plaintiff responds that this after  [*96] acquired evidence cannot defeat her discrimination claim. She also argues that because this issue relates to damages, it is irrelevant at the summary judgment stage. [Doc. 106 at 14]. In reply, Defendant reiterates that the after-acquired evidence limits any damages to which Plaintiff may be entitled and that the evidence is not being used as a basis to defeat Plaintiff's termination claim. [Doc. 117 at 14-15].
In McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., the Supreme Court addressed how courts are to handle after-acquired evidence, i.e., evidence of an employee's wrongdoing that is not revealed until after the employee's discharge. 513 U.S. 352, 354, 115 S. Ct. 879, 130 L. Ed. 2d 852 (1995). The "Court held that after-acquired evidence of wrongful conduct during employment that would have resulted in termination does not 'operate [], in every instance, to bar all relief['] . . . . [Instead,] 'the after-acquired evidence of the employee's wrongdoing bears on the specific remedy to be ordered.'" Dunn Const. Co., 62 F.3d at 378 (quoting McKennon, 513 U.S. at 358, 359). Not only is evidence of wrongdoing during a plaintiff's employment relevant to the after-acquired evidence defense, but also evidence of "the employee's  [*97] misrepresentations in a job application or resume" is relevant. Id. at 379. Although the McKennon case involved claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, courts have applied the after-acquired evidence defense to cases under Title VII, the Equal Pay Act, and, most relevantly, the ADA. See Dunn, 62 F.3d at 378 (Title VII and Equal Pay Act); Rooney v. Koch Air, LLC, 410 F.3d 376, 382 (7th Cir. 2005) (ADA) ("see[ing] no distinction for this purpose between an age discrimination claim like the one in McKennon and an ADA claim"); Burkhart v. Intuit, Inc., No. 07-cv-675, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16328, 2009 WL 528603, *12 (D. Ariz. Mar. 2, 2009) (ADA).
Since Plaintiff challenges the propriety of moving for summary judgment on the basis of the after-acquired defense, the undersigned first addresses whether it is appropriate for a defendant to move for summary judgment relying on this defense. As the following discussion shows, the undersigned concludes that Defendant may move for summary judgment on the basis of the after-acquired evidence defense.
Initially, Plaintiff's argument that the after acquired evidence defense cannot defeat the merits of her ADA discrimination claim is correct. Dunn Constr. Co., 62 F.3d at 381  [*98] ("[T]he after-acquired evidence does not bar recovery, but merely affects the remedy."). Plaintiff's argument is, however, irrelevant because Defendant does not seek to use the after acquired evidence to defeat Plaintiff's ADA discriminatory discharge claim on the merits. Instead, it uses the defense to limit Plaintiff's remedies if she ultimately prevails at trial. [Doc. 86 at 25].
Although the after-acquired evidence defense only relates to damages, Plaintiff's assertion that it is improper to move for summary judgment on the issue of damages is wrong. The undersigned recognizes that Bozeman v. Per-Se Technologies, Inc., supports her position that the after-acquired evidence "defense relates to damages and, as such, is not relevant at the summary judgment stage." 456 F. Supp. 2d 1282, 1291 n.10 (N.D. Ga. 2006) (Vining J., adopting Feldman, M.J.). The undersigned respectfully disagrees with this conclusion and does not follow it for the following three reasons.
First, the undersigned is not bound by the Bozeman decision. See Fishman & Tobin, Inc. v. Tropical Shipping & Const. Co., Ltd., 240 F.3d 956, 965 (11th Cir. 2001) ("[T]he district court cannot be said to be bound by a decision  [*99] of one of its brother or sister judges."). Since the Bozeman decision made this statement in passing without any legal analysis, the decision does not provide any persuasive analysis, and as outlined immediately below, the statement in Bozeman appears to contradict actions taken by the Eleventh Circuit sitting en banc. As such, Bozeman does not present persuasive or binding authority that mandates adherence to its conclusion.
Second, the Eleventh Circuit sitting en banc in Dunn, supra, explicitly reviewed the after-acquired evidence defense following disposition of the defense on a summary judgment motion. In Dunn, the employer moved for partial summary judgment on the basis that plaintiff would have been terminated regardless of sex or retaliation because plaintiff had falsified a job application. Dunn Const. Co., 62 F.2d at 377. The district court denied the motion, but the decision was reviewed on interlocutory appeal. Id. The Eleventh Circuit sitting en banc then issued a decision affirming in part, reversing in part, and remanding in part the case, concluding that the district court: (1) erred in not granting partial summary judgment in favor of the employer with respect to reinstatement,  [*100] front pay, and injunctive relieve remedies; (2) did not err in denying summary judgment as to backpay, unpaid wages, and liquidated damages remedies; and (3) did not err in concluding that the after-acquired evidence does not bar all recovery for damages. Id. at 381. Although the propriety of evaluating the after-acquired evidence defense in a motion for summary judgment was not before the Eleventh Circuit, the undersigned would expect the Court to have addressed this issue as a preliminary matter if it were inappropriate to move for summary judgment on the after-acquired evidence defense. Instead, the Court's decision that the employer was entitled to summary judgment on the basis that Plaintiff could not recover front pay, reinstatement, or injunctive relief strongly suggests that it is appropriate to evaluate the after-acquired evidence defense at the summary judgment stage.
Third, the undersigned notes that courts within and outside the Eleventh Circuit have addressed the after-acquired evidence defense on summary judgment. See, e.g., Cook v. Shaw Indus., 953 F. Supp. 379, 384-85 (M.D. Ala. 1996); see also Nesselrotte v. Allegheny Energy, Inc., 615 F. Supp. 2d 397, 402-07 (W.D. Pa. 2009);  [*101] Greene v. Coach, Inc., 218 F. Supp. 2d 404, 413 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) ("[P]laintiff's position that the after-acquired evidence doctrine cannot be applied at the summary judgment stage of a case misreads the relevant caselaw."). Accord. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(d) ("[T]he court . . . should then issue an order specifying what facts - - including items of damages or other relief - - are not genuinely at issue.") (emphasis added).
Based on the above discussion, the undersigned concludes that Defendant may move for summary judgment based on the after-acquired evidence defense. As a result, the undersigned examines whether Defendant has established that the after-acquired evidence limits Plaintiff's remedies.
Courts have determined that the after-acquired evidence theory is an affirmative defense. See, e.g. Red Deer v. Cherokee County, Iowa, 183 F.R.D. 642, 652-53 (N.D. Iowa 1999); Jones v. Bd. of Trs. of Community Coll. Dist. No. 508, 75 F. Supp. 2d 885, 887 (N.D. Ill. 1999); see also Gorman v. Meeder Fin. Servs., Inc., No. 04-cv-499, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41057, 2007 WL 1657188, *7 (D.N.J. June 5, 2007). Accord. Sellers v. Mineta, 358 F.3d 1058, 1060 (8th Cir. 2004) (assuming without deciding that the after-acquired evidence  [*102] theory is an affirmative defense). As an affirmative defense, Defendant has the burden of establishing the defense. See Baldwin v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ala., 480 F.3d 1287, 1303 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that employer bears burden of proving an affirmative defense); United States for Use and Benefit of Gen. Elec. Supply Co. v. Wiring, Inc., 646 F.2d 1037, 1042 (5th Cir. June 1, 1981) (noting "the general rule that one who asserts the existence of an affirmative defense has the burden of proving that defense"), abrogated on other grounds by Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 102 S. Ct. 1781, 72 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1982); see also McKennon, 513 U.S. at 362-63 (placing burden on employer to establish after-acquired evidence defense). Since Defendant bears the burden of proof, it must show the following to be entitled to summary judgment on this defense:
that party must show affirmatively the absence of a genuine issue of material fact: it must support its motion with credible evidence . . . that would entitle it to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial. In other words, the moving party must show that, on all the essential elements of its case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial, no reasonable jury  [*103] could find for the non-moving party. If the moving party makes such an affirmative showing, it is entitled to summary judgment unless the non-moving party, in response, come[s] forward with significant, probative evidence demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of fact.
Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1115 (quoting Four Parcels, 941 F.2d at 1437).
The undersigned concludes that Defendant has met its burden on summary judgment and therefore is entitled to summary judgment on the after-acquired evidence defense. Since Plaintiff's sole objection to Defendant's use of the after-acquired evidence defense is that Defendant raised the defense prematurely, Plaintiff has not come forward with any evidence to establish a triable issue of fact. As such, Defendant will be entitled to summary judgment if it has affirmatively shown an absence of a genuine issue of material fact on this after-acquired evidence defense. See id.
To establish the after-acquired evidence defense, a defendant must establish "that the wrongdoing was of such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated on those grounds alone if the employer had known of it at the time of the discharge." See McKennon, 513 U.S. at 362-63.  [*104] A defendant therefore must prove the following three elements: (1) a wrongdoing (2) of such severity (3) that the employer would have terminated the plaintiff had it known of the misconduct prior to the actual discharge. See id. Once a defendant prevails on this defense, the plaintiff is precluded "as a general rule" from recovering front pay or being reinstated. Id. at 361-62. Also, the plaintiff may only recover backpay "from the date of the unlawful discharge to the date the new information was discovered." Id. at 362.
The undersigned concludes that Defendant should be granted summary judgment on the basis of the after-acquired evidence defense. On summary judgment, Defendant identifies three situations where Plaintiff engaged in misconduct - - her omission of information from her job application, the circumstances surrounding her vacation to Washington, and her purchase of the telephone system for the senior center with VAC funds. [See Doc. 86 at 23-24]. The evidence produced by Defendant demonstrates that Plaintiff's misconduct was of sufficient severity that it would have subjected her to discharge. Here, Defendant has produced evidence from Cooper, a decisionmaker, that Plaintiff  [*105] would have been terminated from her position had he known about any of this misconduct prior to her termination. (See Cooper Dep. at 94; Cooper Aff. PP 4, 8). With this affirmative evidence on all essential elements of the defense and without any arguments posed by Plaintiff to rebut this showing, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the after-acquired evidence defense.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the after-acquired evidence defense be GRANTED such that Plaintiff be PRECLUDED from obtaining the following remedies: reinstatement; front pay; and back pay after October 22, 2007, 28 (the date of Plaintiff's appeals hearing).

IV. CONCLUSION
For the above reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 86], be GRANTED. Further, the undersigned DECLINES AS UNNECESSARY to rule on Plaintiff's Notices of Objections concerning the affidavits of Voss, Alvizo, and Smith. [Docs. 108-10].
The Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the undersigned.
IT IS SO ORDERED, RECOMMENDED and DIRECTED, this the 16th day of February, 2010.
