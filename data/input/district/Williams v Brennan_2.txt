ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (ECF NO. 26)
Defendant Megan J. Brennan, in her official capacity as Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service ("USPS"), moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff Keith N. Williams's claims for a hostile work environment and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII") and failure to accommodate under the Rehabilitation Act. (Mot., ECF No. 26.) Plaintiff filed an opposition, and Defendant filed a reply. (Opp'n, ECF No. 27; Reply, ECF No. 28.) The Court deems the motion appropriate for decision without oral argument. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b); Local Rule 7-15.
The motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

I. BACKGROUND 1
Plaintiff is a Black industrial engineer who started working at USPS in 1998. [*2]  (Def.'s Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("DSUF") ¶ 1, ECF No. 26-1; Pl.'s Statement of Additional Material Facts ("PSAMF") ¶¶ 89-90, ECF No. 27-5.) During his tenure at USPS, Plaintiff was promoted multiple times. In August 2017, he became the Manager, In Plant Support ("MIPS") at USPS's Los Angeles International Service Center ("LAX ISC"). (DSUF ¶¶ 2, 5; PSAMF ¶¶ 91-92.) As MIPS, Plaintiff was second-in-command at LAX ISC and reported directly to the Plant Manager. (DSUF ¶ 4.) An essential function of his role as MIPS was to directly observe and manage the processing of mail on the workroom floor. (Id. ¶ 3.)

A. Hill-Sandifer Marks Plaintiff AWOL
Around November 2017, Plaintiff submitted a leave request form to Tracie Hill-Sandifer, the Plant Manager at the time. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 10.) The parties dispute whether Hill-Sandifer rejected Plaintiff's leave request or if the request needed to be approved, but they agree that Plaintiff failed to show up for work on January 2, 2018. ( Pl.'s Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact ("PGDMF") ¶¶ 11-12.) Hill-Sandifer was unable to get in touch with Plaintiff and marked him as absent without leave ("AWOL"). (Id. ¶¶ 13-14.) When Plaintiff returned [*3]  to work, he told Hill-Sandifer that he was unaware that his leave request needed to be approved. (Id. ¶ 15.) Hill-Sandifer informed Plaintiff that his leave request did require approval, but she decided not to discipline him for his absence. (Id. ¶ 16.) She retroactively changed his AWOL status to leave without pay, which removed the AWOL status from his time records. (Id. ¶ 17.) Plaintiff subsequently contacted an EEO counselor to file a complaint against Hill-Sandifer, but his initial complaint did not move forward. (Id. ¶ 18.)

B. Hill-Sandifer Moves Plaintiff to the Overnight Shift
During the 2017 holiday season, Hill-Sandifer noticed that mail-sorting operations during LAX ISC's overnight shifts were falling below operational standards. (Id. ¶ 22.) Hill-Sandifer reassigned Plaintiff's work hours to overlap with these overnight shifts so that Plaintiff could address the overnight mail processing issues. (Id. ¶¶ 23, 26-27.) Plaintiff claims that this reassignment caused him personal hardship and that he made several complaints to Hill-Sandifer about his overnight working hours. (PGDMF ¶ 28.) Although Hill-Sandifer maintains that she received no complaints from Plaintiff, Plaintiff [*4]  specifically recalls informing Hill-Sandifer that he could not safely drop his children off at school in the morning after working all night. (Id.)

C. Alfonso Allegedly Writes Up Plaintiff
In June 2018, Michelle "Mia" Alfonso became the Acting Plant Manager at LAX ISC. (DSUF ¶ 33.) In October 2018, Alfonso noticed discrepancies between certain USPS mail condition reports and the actual mail conditions she observed in the facility. (Id. ¶ 36.) Because the MIPS is the ultimate authority responsible for the mail condition reports, Alfonso initiated an investigative interview with Plaintiff to discuss the reports. (Id. ¶¶ 37-38.) After Plaintiff provided an explanation for the discrepancy, Alfonso closed the investigation. (Id. ¶¶ 39-40.) The parties dispute whether Plaintiff was ultimately disciplined. (PGDMF ¶ 40.) Plaintiff did not file any complaint concerning this incident. (DSUF ¶ 41.)

D. Engler Revokes Plaintiff's Building and Computer Access
In October 2018, Lawrence Engler took over as the Acting Plant Manager at LAX ISC. (Id. ¶ 45.) On July 16, 2019, Plaintiff's wife sent an email to Engler stating that Plaintiff would be taking three weeks off work based on a doctor's recommendation, [*5]  followed by two additional weeks of vacation. (Id. ¶¶ 50-51.) The email included Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") paperwork stating that Plaintiff was suffering from stress and depression and estimating that Plaintiff would suffer from emotional outbursts twice a week for a period of two months. (Id. ¶¶ 53-54.) The FMLA paperwork also stated that Plaintiff would be unable to perform any of his job responsibilities until July 2, 2020, and estimated that Plaintiff would require a reduced work schedule wherein he could work for four hours a day for two to three days a week. (Id. ¶¶ 54-55; Engler Decl. Ex. 1, ECF No. 26-4.)
Engler subsequently suspended Plaintiff's building and computer access. (DSUF ¶¶ 56-58.) Plaintiff returned to work on August 19, 2019, and entered LAX ISC with the assistance of a security guard. (Id. ¶¶ 59-60.) Plaintiff was unable to access his computer until Engler approved the restoration of Plaintiff's computer access; Engler approved the building and computer access that same day. (Id. ¶¶ 60-62.)

E. Plaintiff Takes Medical Leave and Files an EEO Complaint
On August 20, 2019, Engler informed Plaintiff that his medical provider would need to complete a standard [*6]  "Return to Work" questionnaire before Plaintiff could resume his duties. (Id. ¶¶ 64, 66-67.) Plaintiff's doctor subsequently completed and signed the Return to Work questionnaire, and Plaintiff submitted the questionnaire to USPS. (PSAMF ¶¶ 96-98.) Plaintiff's doctor recommended that Plaintiff receive a "[m]odified schedule 3 times a week for his therapy sessions." (Id. ¶ 98.) Around the same time, Plaintiff's doctor sent a letter to Engler stating that Plaintiff was ready to return to work. (Id. ¶ 95.) Three days later, Plaintiff called in to request 200 hours of sick leave, which Engler approved. (DSUF ¶ 70.) In October 2019, knowing that Plaintiff's leave was soon expiring, Engler mailed letters to Plaintiff inquiring about his return-to-work status. (Id. ¶ 71.) Plaintiff did not respond to these letters. (Id. ¶ 72.)
On December 7, 2019, Plaintiff filed a formal EEO Complaint against Hill-Sandifer, Alfonso, and Engler. (Id. ¶¶ 77-78.) It alleged that discriminatory acts that took place between January 2018 and August 2019. (Id. ¶ 79.) The complaint referenced (1) Hill-Sandifer's decision to mark him AWOL, (2) Alfonso's investigation of the mail condition reports, and (3) Engler's [*7]  suspension of his building and computer access while on leave. (Id. ¶ 80; Beck Decl. Ex. 2 ("EEO Compl."), ECF No. 26-5.) On June 9, 2020, the Postal Service issued a final agency decision denying Plaintiff's claims, finding that Plaintiff failed to timely contact an EEO counselor as to the Hill-Sandifer and Alfonso incidents, and concluding that Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of disability, race, or sex discrimination. (DSUF ¶¶ 81-83.)

F. Plaintiff Initiates the Present Action
On September 9, 2020, Plaintiff filed suit alleging claims for: (1) hostile work environment in violation of Title VII, (2) retaliation in violation of Title VII, and (3) failure to accommodate in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. (Compl. ¶¶ 34-60, ECF No. 1.)

G. Plaintiff and USPS Negotiate for Reasonable Accommodation
On October 28, 2020, Hill-Sandifer sent a letter to Plaintiff inquiring about his absence from work and asking Plaintiff whether he required reasonable accommodation. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Statement of Genuine Disputes ("DRAMF") ¶ 112, ECF No. 28-1; Hill-Sandifer Decl. Ex. 1, ECF No. 26-2.) On November 18, 2020, Hill-Sandifer sent a second letter stating that, if Plaintiff desired, USPS's District [*8]  Reasonable Accommodation Committee ("DRAC") could help facilitate his return to work. (DRAMF ¶ 112; Hill-Sandifer Decl. Ex. 2, at 7, ECF No. 26-2.)
Plaintiff met with the DRAC on January 14, 2021. (See Beck Decl. Ex. 5, at 81, ECF No. 26-5.) Around January 25, 2021, Plaintiff's doctor completed and signed USPS's "Medical Information and Restriction Assessment" stating that Plaintiff requested an accommodation consisting of "[s]ix months working for 4 hours from home." (PSAMF ¶ 119.) Plaintiff met with DRAC again on March 4, 2021. (Id. ¶ 113.) During this second meeting, the DRAC provided Plaintiff with a list of vacant and funded positions in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. (Id.; DSUF ¶ 85.) The parties dispute whether DRAC ultimately offered Plaintiff reassignment to any vacant, funded position that could accommodate him. (PGDMF ¶ 85.)
On March 10, 2021, Plaintiff's counsel notified USPS that Plaintiff was interested in a Station Manager position. (PSAMF ¶ 114.) On March 12, the USPS informed Plaintiff that he was unqualified for the position. (Id. ¶ 115.) On March 30, 2021, Plaintiff informed USPS that he was "willing to take any available job that will accommodate his disabilities." [*9]  (Id. ¶ 116.) On April 1, 2021, USPS replied that it was "unable to identify any vacant, funded position in which [Plaintiff] can perform all essential functions with or without accommodation given [Plaintiff's] January 2021 medical restrictions." (Id. ¶ 117.)
In July 2021, Plaintiff informally contacted the EEO to complain of alleged discrimination in the accommodation process. (DSUF ¶ 88.)

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 330, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A fact is material when, under the governing law, the resolution of that fact might affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. The burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact lies with the moving party, see Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23, and the court must view the facts and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007). To meet its burden, "[t]he moving party may produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's case, or, after suitable discovery, the moving party may [*10]  show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element of its claim or defense to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1106 (9th Cir. 2000). Once the moving party satisfies its burden, the nonmoving party cannot simply rest on the pleadings or argue that any disagreement or "metaphysical doubt" about a material issue of fact precludes summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). There is no genuine issue for trial where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party. Id. at 587.

III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff does not oppose Defendant's motion for summary judgment with regard to his hostile work environment and retaliation claims. (See Opp'n 6.) The Court nevertheless analyzes these claims along with Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim. See Cristobal v. Siegel, 26 F.3d 1488, 1495 n.4 (9th Cir. 1994) (noting that an unopposed motion for summary judgment may be granted only if there are no genuine issues of material fact); accord C.D. Cal. R. 7-12 ("[A] motion pursuant to [Rule] 56 may not be granted solely based on the failure to file an opposition.").2

A. Hostile Work Environment
Plaintiff claims a hostile work environment based on race and retaliatory animus. (See Compl. ¶¶ 34-41.) To prevail on a hostile work environment claim [*11]  based on race or retaliatory animus, a plaintiff must show: "(1) that he was subjected to verbal or physical conduct of a racial [or retaliatory] nature; (2) that the conduct was unwelcome; and (3) that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the plaintiff's employment and create an abusive work environment." Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 642 (9th Cir. 2003); Ray v. Henderson, 217 F.3d 1234, 1245 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that a hostile work environment claim is actionable when based on retaliation in the same way it is actionable when based on race and gender).
Here, Plaintiff has provided evidence pertaining to the conduct of Hill-Sandifer, Alfonso, and Engler. The conduct of which he complains—being marked AWOL, being moved to an overnight shift, being written up, and having his building and computer access revoked—are discrete employment actions, and not verbal or physical actions. These incidents do not independently support his claim for a hostile work environment. Even if an inference could be made that verbal exchanges took place between Plaintiff and Hill-Sandifer, Alfonso, or Engler during the course of these employment actions, Plaintiff provides no evidence that these exchanges were racial or retaliatory in nature. In fact, Plaintiff admits [*12]  that he never heard Hill-Sandifer, Alfonso, or Engler make any discriminatory remarks or slurs. (DSUF ¶¶ 32, 42, 74.)
The motion is GRANTED with respect to Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim.

B. Retaliation
Plaintiff claims that USPS retaliated against him for requesting EEO intervention and filing EEO complaints. (See Compl. ¶¶ 42-49.) To prevail on a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case by showing: (1) that he engaged in a protected activity, (2) that his employer subsequently subjected him to an adverse employment action, and (3) that there was a causal link between the employee's engagement in the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Cohen v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 686 F.2d 793, 796 (9th Cir. 1982). After the plaintiff makes this initial showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its action. Id. If the defendant meets its burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the defendant's asserted reason was a pretext for retaliation. Id.
Here, Plaintiff has failed to make a prima facie showing of retaliation. The evidence shows that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity in January 2018, when he contacted an EEO counselor [*13]  to file an informal complaint; in December 2019, when he filed a formal EEO complaint; and in July 2021, when he informally contacted the EEO to complain of alleged discrimination in the accommodation process. (DSUF ¶¶ 18, 77, 88.) Plaintiff's January 2018 contact with an EEO counselor cannot form the basis of a retaliation claim because the EEO counselor was the only person aware of that contact. (DSUF ¶ 20); see Cohen, 686 F.2d at 796 ("Essential to a causal link is evidence that the employer was aware that the plaintiff had engaged in the protected activity."). Moreover, because the December 2019 and July 2021 protected activities occurred after the alleged adverse employment actions initiated by Hill-Sandifer, Alfonso, and Engler, Plaintiff cannot reasonably claim that those adverse employment actions were taken in response to his protected activities.
At best, Plaintiff might claim that USPS decided in April 2021 that Plaintiff was unqualified for any vacant and funded position in the Los Angeles area in retaliation for Plaintiff's December 2019 filing of a formal EEO complaint. However, Plaintiff has not provided any evidence for such a causal link. See Cohen, 686 F.2d at 797 ("The requisite causal link is not established [*14]  by the mere fact that Reynolds learned of Bires' complaint prior to [the adverse action]."). In any case, Defendant has provided evidence that its April 2021 decision was grounded in non-retaliatory reasons, i.e., that none of the vacant and funded positions could accommodate the part-time schedule that Plaintiff required. (See PSAMF ¶ 117.) Plaintiff has made no corresponding showing that these non-retaliatory reasons are pretextual.
The motion is GRANTED with respect to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

C. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff claims that USPS failed to provide him reasonable accommodation for his mental disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. (See Compl. ¶¶ 50-60.) Plaintiff relies on two separate theories: (1) Engler failed to timely initiate an interactive process to provide Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation for his mental disability after Plaintiff returned to work on August 19, 2019, (Opp'n 7-10); and (2) USPS failed to act in good faith in the interactive process because it failed to identify any vacant and funded positions in the Los Angeles area that could accommodate him, (id. at 10-11).

1. Exhaustion
The Court first considers whether Plaintiff has exhausted his administrative [*15]  remedies with respect to his two failure-to-accommodate theories. The Rehabilitation Act requires that a plaintiff exhaust his remedies "by filing a timely charge with the EEOC, or the appropriate state agency," prior to bringing his claim before a federal court. B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dep't, 276 F.3d 1091, 1099 (9th Cir. 2002); see Vinieratos v. United States, 939 F.2d 762, 773 (9th Cir. 1991) (requiring exhaustion as a prerequisite to bringing a Rehabilitation Act claim against a federal agency). Ordinarily, "specific claims made in district court . . . must be presented to the EEOC." Leong v. Potter, 347 F.3d 1117, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003). However, a district court may consider "any charges of discrimination that are like or reasonably related to the allegations made before the EEOC, as well as charges that are within the scope of an EEOC investigation that reasonably could be expected to grow out of the allegations." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). When determining whether a plaintiff has exhausted allegations not specified in a prior administrative charge, courts consider (1) "the alleged basis of the discrimination," (2) "dates of discriminatory acts specified within the charge," (3) "perpetrators of discrimination named in the charge," and (4) "any locations at which discrimination is alleged to have occurred." B.K.B., 276 F.3d at 1100.
Although Plaintiff did not allege a failure to accommodate in his EEO [*16]  Complaint, he did claim that Engler discriminated against him based on mental disability when Engler revoked his building and computer access. (EEO Compl. ¶ 14.) This suffices to exhaust Plaintiff's theory that Engler failed to timely engage Plaintiff in an interactive process to find reasonable accommodation for his mental disability. First, "the alleged basis of the discrimination" is the same. The EEO Complaint alleged discrimination based on Plaintiff's mental disability, and Plaintiff now alleges a failure to accommodate based on the same mental disability. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 53; Opp'n 8-9.) Second, the dates of the discriminatory acts overlap. The EEO Complaint referenced Engler's suspension of Plaintiff's access to work resources through July and August 2019 after Engler learned of Plaintiff's mental disability. Plaintiff now alleges that Engler failed to engage in an interactive process to find reasonable accommodation, an obligation that Plaintiff argues arose around July 2019 when Engler discovered Plaintiff's need for accommodation. (EEO Compl. ¶ 14; Opp'n 8-9.) Third, the alleged "perpetrators of discrimination" are the same. The EEO Complaint alleged that Engler discriminated [*17]  against Plaintiff, and Plaintiff now alleges that Engler failed to accommodate his disability. Finally, the "locations at which discrimination is alleged to have occurred" are the same. The EEO Complaint alleged discrimination at LAX ISC, and Plaintiff now alleges that Engler should have initiated an interactive process with him after he returned to work at that same location. Because all four B.K.B. factors indicate that Plaintiff's first theory of a failure to initiate an interactive process "reasonably could be expected to grow out of" the EEO allegations, Plaintiff has met the exhaustion requirement with respect to his first allegation. Cf. McCarthy v. Brennan, 230 F. Supp. 3d 1049, 1059-61 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (finding exhaustion under similar circumstances).
Although the exhaustion analysis with respect to the second theory is less straightforward, it nevertheless leads to the same result. Plaintiff's allegation that USPS failed to act in good faith when it declined to offer Plaintiff an alternative job in the Los Angeles area shares the same basis as one of the charges in the EEO Complaint, i.e., mental disability. While the facts are not clear as to which USPS employees were involved in the interactive process, or where the interactive process occurred, [*18]  the parties do not dispute that Hill-Sandifer, whose conduct Plaintiff also complained of in the EEO Complaint, (EEO Compl. ¶¶ 12-16), initiated the interactive process on behalf of USPS. (DRAMF ¶ 112.) Therefore, at least one alleged perpetrator of discrimination is the same. More importantly, because an investigation into the EEO Complaint's allegations of discrimination could reasonably grow to encompass Engler's failure to timely initiate an interactive process, it could similarly grow to encompass USPS's subsequent failure to engage in the interactive process in good faith. Both of Plaintiff's allegations relate to a single effort by Plaintiff to obtain reasonable accommodation for a mental disability, and it would be incongruous for the Court to consider one of the allegations but not the other.
Defendant focuses on the second B.K.B. factor and argues that, because USPS did not begin the interactive process until October 2020, four months after a final decision concerning the EEO Complaint issued, a reasonable investigation related to the EEO Complaint could not have covered later events. (See Mot. 20-21.) However, "Ninth Circuit precedent provides that even facts occurring after the [*19]  administrative agency has completed its investigation can fall within the scope of an earlier administrative complaint so long as they are sufficiently similar to the claims raised therein." Pringle v. Wheeler, 478 F. Supp. 3d 899, 909 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Plaintiff's EEO Complaint alleged discrimination based on the onset of his mental disability in July 2019. Plaintiff's theory that USPS failed to engage in the interactive process to accommodate that disability is sufficiently similar to the allegations made in his EEO Complaint.
The Court finds that Plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to both of his failure-to-accommodate theories.

2. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process in Good Faith
An employee's request for accommodation triggers a duty on the part of an employer "to engage in an 'interactive process' through which the employer and employee can come to understand the employee's abilities and limitations, the employer's needs for various positions, and a possible middle ground for accommodating the employee." Snapp v. United Transp. Union, 889 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 2018). However, the employer will face liability only "if a reasonable accommodation would have been possible." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis removed). [*20]  "In other words, there exists no stand-alone claim for failing to engage in the interactive process," and a claim arises only if an employer denies "available and reasonable accommodation." Id. At the summary judgment phase, once the plaintiff has shown that an employer failed to engage in the interactive process in good faith, the burden "shifts to the employer to prove the unavailability of a reasonable accommodation." Id.
Here, Plaintiff has raised a genuine dispute as to whether Engler and USPS failed to engage in the interactive process in good faith. On July 16, 2019, Plaintiff's wife sent Engler FMLA paperwork indicating that Plaintiff would require a reduced work schedule wherein Plaintiff could work for four hours a day for two to three days a week. (DSUF ¶¶ 50, 53-55.) These facts indicate that there was a request for accommodation. Defendant counters that, on August 19, 2019, Plaintiff gave Engler a letter from his doctor clearing him for work. (See Reply 5-6.) Rather than negating Plaintiff's prior request for accommodation, the letter could be read as consistent with his request. The letter states that Plaintiff "has been released and is ready to return to work on Monday [*21]  August 19, 2019." Sequeira Decl. Ex. B, ECF No. 27-1.) Because a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the letter permits Plaintiff to return to work only with the accommodations he requested, the letter did not necessarily absolve Engler or USPS of their responsibility to engage Plaintiff in an interactive process.
Defendant also points to a "Return to Work" questionnaire that Plaintiff's doctor completed requesting a "[m]odified schedule 3 times a week for [Plaintiff's] therapy sessions." (See Reply 5-6; Sequeira Decl. Ex. C, ECF No. 27-1.) This request is also consistent with Plaintiff's request for a two-to-three day workweek. Viewed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, this request also did not affect Engler and USPS's duty to engage in an interactive process.
Although the parties dispute whether Plaintiff requested an accommodation in August 2019, they do not dispute that USPS waited until October 28, 2020 to engage in an interactive process with Plaintiff. (DRAMF ¶ 112.) Although this 15-month delay from Plaintiff's initial July 16, 2019 request for accommodation is not dispositive as to the issue of bad faith, particularly since Plaintiff remained on leave through August [*22]  2019 and did not respond to Engler's repeated attempts to contact him by mail, it nevertheless raises a genuine dispute as to whether Engler and USPS failed to timely engage Plaintiff in an interactive process. Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1117 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating that a five-month delay and corresponding failure to communicate "do not reflect good faith engagement in the interactive process"), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002).
Moreover, the evidence raises a triable issue as to whether USPS engaged in the interactive process in good faith. On March 30, 2021, Plaintiff informed USPS that he was "willing to take any available job that will accommodate his disabilities." (PSAMF ¶ 116.) Two days later, on April 1, 2021, USPS responded that "it has been unable to identify any vacant, funded position in which [Plaintiff] can perform all essential functions with or without accommodation." (PSAMF ¶ 117.) USPS stated that Plaintiff's "medical restrictions render it impossible for [him] to perform the essential functions of [his] position or any into which [he] could be reassigned." (See Qureshi Decl. Ex. F, ECF No. 27-3.) USPS did not provide any explanation for its inability to find an accommodation except to state that Plaintiff had [*23]  failed to identify a specific position he wanted USPS to reconsider as a potential reassignment for him. (Id.) USPS then stated it was "closing out" Plaintiff's file and ended the interactive process. (Id.) A reasonable juror could find that USPS's unilateral termination of the interactive process—two days after Plaintiff expanded his request for accommodation to include reassignment to any vacant and funded position—did not constitute a good faith engagement in the process. Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to identify a specific alternative job which he could perform. (Reply 9-10.) However, "[i]t is the employer's responsibility, through participation in the interactive process, to assist in identifying possible accommodations." Morton v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 272 F.3d 1249, 1256 (9th Cir. 2001), overruled on other grounds by Bates v. UPS, 511 F.3d 974 (9th Cir. 2007). A simple assertion that USPS has failed to identify a possible accommodation does not satisfy this responsibility.
Because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether USPS engaged in the interactive process in good faith, the burden shifts to Defendant to show the unavailability of a reasonable accommodation. See Snapp, 889 F.3d at 1095. On July 16, 2019, Plaintiff requested a reduced work schedule of four hours a day for two to [*24]  three days a week for a period ending on July 2, 2020. (DSUF ¶¶ 50, 53-54.) On or around January 25, 2021, Plaintiff requested a reduced work schedule of four hours a day for a period of six months. (PSAMF ¶¶ 118-19.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff's original position as MIPS and the other vacant and funded positions were not part-time positions, and that USPS was not required to create new part-time positions to accommodate Plaintiff. (Mot. 23.) However, Defendant has failed to provide any evidence showing why USPS could not accommodate Plaintiff's request for accommodation on a temporary basis. For example, even if USPS could not accommodate a temporary part-time schedule, USPS could have offered Plaintiff six months of unpaid leave as a reasonable accommodation. See Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1135 (9th Cir. 2001) ("A leave of absence for medical treatment may be a reasonable accommodation . . . ."). Defendant has therefore failed to meet its burden of showing that no reasonable accommodation existed.
Defendant alternatively argues that Plaintiff's claim fails because Plaintiff has failed to show that he can perform the "essential functions" of his position. (Mot. 22); see also Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir. 1996) ("A plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating [*25]  that she can perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation."). However, Plaintiff's temporary inability to perform the essential functions of his position does not dispose of his failure-to-accommodate claim. See Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1135-36 ("We have held that where a leave of absence would reasonably accommodate an employee's disability and permit him, upon his return, to perform the essential functions of the job, that employee is otherwise qualified . . . ."). Here, Plaintiff has made only temporary requests for accommodation, and a favorable reading of the evidence suggests that Plaintiff will be able to perform the essential functions of his position after the accommodations end.
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED with respect to Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim.

IV. CONCLUSION
The motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The Court enters summary judgment in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff on Plaintiff's hostile work environment and retaliation claims. The motion is denied in all other respects.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
