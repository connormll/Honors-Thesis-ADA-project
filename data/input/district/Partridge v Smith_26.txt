Opinion



RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak
This matter comes before the Court on Defendant Boulder County Sheriff's Office Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [#119] (the "Motion"), seeking dismissal of Claims 11 and 12 of the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). The Motion has been referred to this Court. [#120] This Court has carefully considered the Motion and related briefing, the entire case file and the applicable case law, and has determined that oral argument would not materially assist in the disposition of the Motion. For the following reasons, the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that the Motion be DENIED.

I. BACKGROUND

A. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS1
Plaintiff suffers from schizophrenia, which includes psychosis, auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. [#1, ¶ 15] In 2015 and 2016, as Plaintiff's symptoms worsened, Plaintiff was arrested on "various minor charges" and each time went to the Boulder County Jail ("BCJ"). [Id. at ¶ 18]
Plaintiff [*4]  was well-known to BCJ jail staff, who frequently noted concerns with respect to Plaintiff's mental health and behavior. In February 2016, when Plaintiff was taken into custody, "Deputies noted that [Plaintiff] was different than he had been before when he was at the jail[—]he was more mentally ill than he had been previously." [Id. at ¶ 19] Jail records indicated that deputies and mental health staff observed that Plaintiff "had been on psychiatric medications in the past, was not currently on medications, was presenting with psychosis and acting bizarrely." [Id.] Deputy Foster contacted mental health workers reporting that Plaintiff was psychotic and should be on "house alone" status. [Id. at ¶ 22] In March 2016, Deputy Bryant wrote that Plaintiff was "well known to the Boulder County jail staff and has a history of mental health issues, which ha[ve] been deteriorating considerably, with each passing incarceration." [Id. at ¶ 19] Also in March 2016, Plaintiff had been placed in Disciplinary, Special Management and Maximum Module at the jail because of his psychotic behavior. [Id. at ¶ 24] In October 2016, Deputy Mendez noted that it was "obvious [Plaintiff] was very paranoid [and] [*5]  [h]is comments seemed to . . . get more and more distant from reality." [Id. at ¶ 43] Plaintiff alleges that throughout 2016 he was "periodically . . . taken from the jail to go to the state mental hospital or an affiliated treatment center in attempts to restore him to legal competency to face the minor criminal charges pending against him." [Id. at ¶ 3; see also id. at ¶¶ 30-31]
Plaintiff's struggles with mental health manifested in his behavior numerous times throughout his incarceration at BCJ. In early 2016, Plaintiff reported to unnamed deputies that the CIA was telling him to "dig out his eyes," and he unsuccessfully attempted to do so. [Id. at ¶¶ 20, 29] When Deputy Christian Berringer responded to Plaintiff's cell, Plaintiff asked him if he was there to kill Plaintiff. [Id. at ¶ 23] Plaintiff repeated concerns that deputies were trying to kill him or frame him for killing his family members on other occasions. [Id. at ¶¶ 43-44] In March 2016, Plaintiff began forcing himself to vomit, telling deputies that the jail was poisoning his food and complaining about hearing voices. [Id. at ¶ 32] Plaintiff also describes times where he spoke to himself and others in an accent, and sent [*6]  "kites" with nonsensical writings. [Id. at ¶¶ 35, 37, 39-40] In September 2016, BCJ deputies observed Plaintiff pacing back and forth and screaming that he was "not crazy." [Id. at ¶ 38] The following month, officers reported that Plaintiff "appeared to be delusional, could not grasp [they] were trying to help him feel safe, he was distanced from reality, [and] he could not engage in normal conversation." [Id. at ¶ 43] In response to Plaintiff' delusional behavior, Sergeant Kellison moved Plaintiff to the disciplinary module because there was no room in the Special Management section of the jail. [Id.] Moreover, Plaintiff intentionally harmed himself several times, including banging his head into the toilet of his cell and breaking his own teeth, jumping off of a second tier railing, and attempting to gouge his eyes out, ultimately successfully. [Id. at ¶¶ 21, 28-29, 31, 45, 52, 78-79, 81, 94] The self-harm attempts were frequently witnessed by jail staff. [See id.]
Plaintiff alleges that in response to his erratic behavior, caused by his struggles with mental illness, officers "repeatedly used excessive force against an uncomprehending [Plaintiff], regularly tasing and punching him, [*7]  leaving him bloodied, in pain, and tortured." [Id. at ¶ 5] On March 3, 2016, Deputy Anthony Hollonds opened the cell door to give Plaintiff a food tray, and Plaintiff jammed the food tray into the cell door so that it could not be closed. [Id. at ¶ 24] Plaintiff slipped out the cell door, and Deputy Hollonds punched Plaintiff in the face and wrestled him to the ground. [Id.] Once Plaintiff was on the ground, Deputy Hollonds continued to punch Plaintiff in the head. [Id.] After Deputy Hollonds got Plaintiff back into his cell, jail officials made the decision to move Plaintiff to a more secure cell. [Id.] While transporting Plaintiff to that cell, Plaintiff planted his feet and refused to keep walking. [Id.] Deputies pinned Plaintiff against the door and ordered Plaintiff to stop resisting. [Id.] Sergeant Thomas Groff then tased Plaintiff, using the drive-stun feature of the taser. [Id.]
Later that same month, on March 22, 2016, while Plaintiff was being escorted back to his cell, Plaintiff stuck out his hands and arms so that the cell door would not close. [Id. at ¶ 27] Deputy Vili Maumau punched Plaintiff in the chest and told him to move back. [Id.] Plaintiff remained non-compliant. [*8]  [Id.] After warning Plaintiff that he would be tased if he did not comply, Deputy Maumau used his taser to drive-stun Plaintiff's fingers so that he could remove them from the door. [Id.]
That same day, deputies observed Plaintiff attempting to gouge his eyes out, and decided to put Plaintiff in a restraint chair with a "spit sock" over his head, though Plaintiff had been compliant and not spitting. [Id. at ¶ 28] Plaintiff then began spitting at officers through the sock, and Sergeant Lydia Mitchell tased Plaintiff. [Id.] Also in March 2016, when jail personnel saw Plaintiff forcing himself to vomit, six officers approached Plaintiff in full riot gear, pinned him against a wall yelling "Get down!", and placed him in a restraint chair with a spit sock forced over his head. [Id. at ¶ 32]
Several months later, on December 2, 2016, Deputies claimed Plaintiff was not following protocol to visit his attorney. [Id. at ¶ 53] When the deputies attempted to place restraints on Plaintiff, Plaintiff, "while paranoid, delusional, and concerned that deputies were trying to kill him," swung at a deputy. [Id.] In response, Deputies Robert Hicks and Dan Newcomb punched Plaintiff in the face. [Id.] Other [*9]  deputies punched Plaintiff as well. [Id.] Once Plaintiff fell to the ground, Deputy Hicks continued to "pummel" Plaintiff in the back with "hammer-fist blows." [Id.] Sergeants Groff and Karmen Koger both tased Plaintiff. [Id.] After the incident, Plaintiff was covered in blood and bleeding from his head, nose, and mouth. [Id.] When Plaintiff was charged for this incident, he refused to go to court, instead remaining naked in his cell and refusing to speak. [Id. at ¶ 54]
On December 8, Deputies Chuck Sisneros, Palmer, Ubias, Gerhart, and Sergeants Koger and Groff planned to handcuff and restrain Plaintiff for a visit with his parents. [Id. at ¶ 57] Plaintiff did not appropriately follow orders and pulled one arm through the food port so that only one arm was handcuffed. [Id.] In response, Deputy Sisneros punched Plaintiff and Sergeant Koger tased Plaintiff. [Id.]
A few weeks later, on December 16, Plaintiff had been lying naked and non-responsive with only a blanket covering him for several days. [Id. at ¶¶ 59-60] Deputy Gregory Clem and Sergeants Koger, Groff, and others planned to see if they could get Plaintiff to move. [Id. at ¶ 60] Officers entered the cell and Sergeant Groff pulled [*10]  the blanket off of Plaintiff's body. [Id.] Plaintiff jumped up, screamed nonsense, and rushed toward the door, and officers responded by punching and tasing Plaintiff. [Id.] This amounted to the third time Sergeant Koger had tased Plaintiff in less than two weeks. [Id.] In addition to officers' consistent use of force, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants allowed him to "languish in solitary confinement" in response to his behavior—"a condition known to . . . significantly worsen mental illness." [Id. at ¶ 81]
On December 17, 2016, the day after a Boulder County District Court Judge had issued an Emergency Order that Plaintiff be immediately taken to a psychiatric hospital, Deputy Berringer passed by Plaintiff's door and noticed he had dried blood on the side of his face that appeared to come from the corner of his eye. [Id. at ¶¶ 62, 69] An hour later, Deputy Berringer again passed by Plaintiff's cell, noticing a significant amount of blood and fluid coming from Plaintiff's left eye, and observing that Plaintiff's eye was swollen. [Id. at ¶ 71] Other deputies noted Plaintiff had blood on his hands. [Id.] Plaintiff stood and Deputies Berringer and Smith saw that both eyes were swollen [*11]  and bleeding. [Id.] By this point, Plaintiff was blinded and covered in blood. [Id. at ¶ 72] According to officers, Plaintiff was not compliant when they attempted to place handcuffs on him. [Id.] Because of this alleged noncompliance, Deputy Smith slammed Plaintiff to the ground and Deputy Maumau tased him. [Id.]
Plaintiff was eventually transported to Denver Health Medical Center. [Id. at ¶ 77] Plaintiff's diagnoses included: self-inflicted ruptured globe and retinal detachment, psychosis, schizoaffective disorder, and chronic psychotic illness. [Id. at ¶ 78] Dr. Frank Siringo in the Department of Ophthalmology concluded that Plaintiff would be permanently blind in both eyes. [Id. at ¶ 79] While in the care of Denver Health Medical Center, Plaintiff was compliant with his medication and cooperated with his medical treatment. [Id. at ¶ 80]
Plaintiff states that Defendant Boulder County Sheriff's Office "failed (and continues to fail) to properly train, supervise and/or discipline its employees regarding the proper treatment of, and accommodations for, individuals with disabilities and, in particular, mental disabilities." [Id. at ¶ 204] Plaintiff further claims that "Defendant supervisory [*12]  personnel at [BCJ] have public[ly] admitted they cannot handle mentally ill inmates." [Id. at ¶ 89; see also id. at ¶¶ 90-92]

B. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On December 7, 2017, Plaintiff initiated the instant action. [#1] Plaintiff's Complaint alleged thirteen causes of action. [Id.] On March 5, 2019, United States District Judge Christine M. Arguello issued an Order on this Court's Recommendation on two motions to dismiss filed by Defendants. [#108; see also ##48, 66, 88] Judge Arguello dismissed Claims One, Five, Ten, and Thirteen, which alleged deliberate indifference by certain Defendants to several instance of Plaintiff's self-harm, and supervisory liability for those deliberate indifference claims. [See #108 at 39-40; #1 at ¶¶ 93-105, 133-43, 184-95, 220-26] Claims Two through Four and Six through Nine, alleging excessive force against several Defendants [#1 at ¶¶ 106-32, 144-83], and Claims 11 and 12, alleging violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 ("ADA") and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701, by the Boulder County Sheriff's Office [id. at ¶¶ 196-219] remain.
On May 14, 2019, Defendant Boulder County Sheriff's Office2 filed the instant Motion, arguing that Plaintiff [*13]  has failed to state a claim under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, on the grounds that: (1) Plaintiff has failed to state an ADA claim based on failure to accommodate; and (2) Plaintiff has failed to state an ADA claim based on discriminatory use of force. [See generally #119] Plaintiff responded to Defendant's Motion [#127], and Defendant has filed a reply [#128].

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court may dismiss a complaint for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." "A motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is treated as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)." Atl. Richfield Co. v. Farm Credit Bank of Wichita, 226 F.3d 1138, 1160 (10th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, in deciding both motions, the court must "accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations . . . and view these allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff." Casanova v. Ulibarri, 595 F.3d 1120, 1124 (10th Cir. 2010) (quoting Smith v. United States, 561 F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th Cir. 2009)). Nonetheless, a plaintiff may not rely on mere labels or conclusions, "and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).
"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Plausibility refers "to the scope of the allegations in a complaint: if they [*14]  are so general that they encompass a wide swath of conduct, much of it innocent, then the plaintiffs 'have not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.'" Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). "The burden is on the plaintiff to frame a 'complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest' that he or she is entitled to relief." Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The ultimate duty of the court is to "determine whether the complaint sufficiently alleges facts supporting all the elements necessary to establish an entitlement to relief under the legal theory proposed." Forest Guardians v. Forsgren, 478 F.3d 1149, 1160 (10th Cir. 2007).

III. ANALYSIS
Title II of the ADA states, in pertinent part, that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. This provision applies to prisoners. See Pa. Dep't of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 210, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1998). "To state a claim under Title II, the plaintiff must allege that (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability, (2) who was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public entity's services, programs, or activities, and (3) such exclusion, denial [*15]  of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of a disability."3 Robertson v. Las Animas Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, 500 F.3d 1185, 1193 (10th Cir. 2007).
For the purposes of the instant Motion, Defendant assumes that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged he is a qualified individual with a disability. [#119 at 8 n.4] But Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to plausibly plead that Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. [Id. at 9] "Courts have recognized three ways to establish a discrimination claim: (1) intentional discrimination (disparate treatment); (2) disparate impact; and (3) failure to make a reasonable accommodation." J.V. v. Albuquerque Pub. Sch., 813 F.3d 1289, 1295 (10th Cir. 2016). Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to state an ADA claim because any underlying allegations with respect to inadequate mental health treatment cannot give rise to a failure to accommodate claim, and because Plaintiff has failed to state an intentional discrimination claim based on discriminatory use of force. [See generally #119]
The Court reads the Complaint as alleging a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, premised on the following conduct: (1) inadequate medical treatment; (2) jail staff's allegedly inappropriate interactions with Plaintiff, including the use of excessive [*16]  force and exacerbation of his condition through placement in solitary confinement; and (3) Defendant's failure to train its staff on how to recognize and accommodate inmates with mental health conditions. [See generally #1] The Court first addresses the standards for an ADA failure to accommodate claim, and then discusses the foregoing conduct giving rise to Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim.

A. Failure to Accommodate Legal Standards
As the Tenth Circuit has instructed, the ADA "requires more than physical access to public entities: it requires public entities to provide meaningful access to their programs and services." Robertson, 500 F.3d at 1195 (emphasis in original) (quotations omitted). To effectuate Title II's mandate, Department of Justice "regulations require public entities to 'make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.'" Id. (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)). "A public entity must provide a reasonable accommodation under the ADA when it knows that the individual is disabled and requires an accommodation of some kind to participate in or receive the benefits of its services." J.V., 813 F.3d at 1299 (quotation omitted); see also [*17]  Paine v. City of Chicago, No. 06 C 3173, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145347, 2009 WL 10687409, at *3 (N.D. Ill. May 21, 2009) ("Once an arrestee with a disability is in custody, the police have a duty to reasonably accommodate the arrestee's disability." (collecting cases)). "[A] public entity is on notice that an individual needs an accommodation when it knows that an individual requires one, either because that need is obvious or because the individual requests an accommodation." J.V., 813 F.3d at 1299 (quotation omitted); see also Robertson, 500 F.3d at 1197 ("When a disabled individual's need for an accommodation is obvious, the individual's failure to expressly 'request' one is not fatal to the ADA claim."). "[T]he critical component of the entity's knowledge is that it is aware not just that the individual is disabled, but that the individual's disability affects his ability to receive the benefits of the entity's services." Robertson, 500 F.3d at 1197 n.10.
Here, as discussed above, Defendant assumes that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that he is a qualified individual with a disability. [#119 at 8 n.4] But Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to identify any request for accommodation. [Id. at 10] The Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient at this juncture to demonstrate that Plaintiff's need for accommodation—including with respect to how officers handled altercations [*18]  with him, as discussed in detail below—was obvious, and thus an explicit request for accommodation was unnecessary.
Plaintiff alleges that jail staff noted concerns with respect to Plaintiff's mental health and behavior multiple times. In February 2016, when Plaintiff was taken into custody, "Deputies noted that [Plaintiff] was different than he had been before when he was at the jail[—]he was more mentally ill than he had been previously." [#1, ¶ 19] Jail records indicated that deputies and mental health staff noted Plaintiff "had been on psychiatric medications in the past, was not currently on medications, was presenting with psychosis and acting bizarrely." [Id.] On February 25, 2016, Deputy Foster contacted mental health workers reporting that Plaintiff was psychotic and should be on "house alone" status. [Id. at ¶ 22] In March 2016, Deputy Bryant wrote that Plaintiff was "well known to the Boulder County jail staff and has a history of mental health issues, which ha[ve] been deteriorating considerably, with each passing incarceration." [Id. at ¶ 19] Also in March 2016, Plaintiff had been placed in Disciplinary, Special Management and Maximum Module at the jail because of his psychotic [*19]  behavior. [Id. at ¶ 24] In October 2016, Deputy Mendez noted that it was "obvious [Plaintiff] was very paranoid [and] [h]is comments seemed to . . . get more and more distant from reality." [Id. at ¶ 43 (emphasis added)] Furthermore, Plaintiff alleges that throughout 2016 he was "periodically . . . taken from the jail to go to the state mental hospital or an affiliated treatment center in attempts to restore him to legal competency to face the minor criminal charges pending against him." [Id. at ¶ 3; see also id. at ¶¶ 30-31]
Plaintiff also recounts numerous interactions with jail staff that made his need for an accommodation obvious. In early 2016, Plaintiff reported to unnamed deputies that the CIA was telling him to "dig out his eyes," and he unsuccessfully attempted to do so. [Id. at ¶¶ 19, 20] Plaintiff repeated concerns that deputies were trying to kill him or frame him for killing his family members. [Id. at ¶¶ 23, 43-44] In March 2016, Plaintiff began forcing himself to vomit, telling deputies that the jail was poisoning his food and complaining about hearing voices. [Id. at ¶ 32] Plaintiff also describes times where he spoke to himself and others in an accent, and sent "kites" [*20]  with nonsensical writings. [Id. at ¶¶ 35, 37, 39-40] In September 2016, BCJ deputies observed Plaintiff pacing back and forth and screaming that he was "not crazy." [Id. at ¶ 38] Moreover, Plaintiff intentionally harmed himself several times, including banging his head into the toilet of his cell and breaking his own teeth, jumping off of a second tier railing, and again attempting to gouge his eyes out, ultimately successfully. [Id. at ¶¶ 21, 28-29, 31, 45, 52, 78-79, 81, 94] The self-harm attempts were frequently witnessed by jail staff. [See id.]
The Court finds that these allegations plausibly plead that Plaintiff's need for a reasonable accommodation was obvious. See, e.g., Hans v. Bd. Of Shawnee Cty. C'mmrs, 775 F. App'x 953, 961 (10th Cir. 2019) (finding a jury could reasonably conclude that the need for an accommodation was obvious because deputies knew plaintiff was deaf, and video evidence demonstrated that "they had considerable difficulty trying to understand what she was saying"); Ulibarri v. City & Cty. of Denver, 742 F. Supp. 2d 1192, 1215 (D. Colo. 2010) (finding that because plaintiff's deafness was "obvious," "the question of whether the Jail therefore should have known of effect of the disability on [plaintiff's] ability to participate in the Jail's programs and service should go to the jury"); Hughes v. Colo. Dep't of Corr., 594 F. Supp. 2d 1226, 1245 (D. Colo. 2009) (finding plaintiff [*21]  had "alleged enough facts that it [wa]s at least plausible that his need for reasonable modifications was obvious," where plaintiff had alleged that the Colorado Department of Corrections "was aware of his mental health condition by virtue of a state court sentencing order" and "unquestionably was aware of his repeated attempts to participate in a supervised program of parole"); see also Wade v. Montgomery Cty., No. 4:17-CV-1040, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216522, 2017 WL 7058237, at *5 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2017) (finding plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that her mental illness and need for accommodation was obvious, including because she had been placed on suicide watch, had informed jail employees that she was disabled and suicidal when she was first incarcerated, and her mental illness was apparent), report and recommendation adopted, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12400, 2018 WL 580642 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 25, 2018).
The Court is thus left to determine whether Defendant refused to provide a reasonable accommodation to Plaintiff. Generally, whether an entity failed to provide a reasonable accommodation under the ADA is a question of fact to be decided by the fact finder. Tabura v. Kellogg USA, 880 F.3d 544, 555 (10th Cir. 2018); see also Bahl v. Cty. of Ramsey, 695 F.3d 778, 784-85 (8th Cir. 2012) ("The reasonable modification inquiry is highly fact-specific and varies depending on the circumstances of each case, including the exigent circumstances presented by criminal [*22]  activity and safety concerns."). As discussed above, Plaintiff alleges three possible actions giving rise to an ADA failure to accommodate claim—inadequate medical treatment, jail personnel's interactions with him, including the use of excessive force and solitary confinement, and failure to train. The Court addresses whether Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff in the context of each theory below.

B. Inadequate Medical Treatment
The Supreme Court has noted that "the alleged deliberate refusal of prison officials to accommodate [an inmate's] disability-related needs in such fundamentals as . . . medical care" may "constitute exclusion from participation in or . . . denial of the benefits of the prison's services, programs, or activities" under the ADA. United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157, 126 S. Ct. 877, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006) (alterations and quotations omitted). In determining whether the denial of medical treatment can give rise to an ADA claim, courts have distinguished between allegations of inadequate medical treatment, "versus claims alleging that a plaintiff was discriminatorily precluded from access to medical treatment altogether." Hughes, 594 F. Supp. 2d at 1241 (collecting cases). Generally, "the failure to provide medical treatment to a disabled prisoner, while [*23]  perhaps raising Eighth Amendment concerns in certain circumstances, does not constitute an ADA violation." Rashad v. Doughty, 4 F. App'x 558, 560 (10th Cir. 2001) (collecting cases); see also Fitzgerald v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 403 F.3d 1134, 1144 (10th Cir. 2005) (finding "purely medical decisions . . . do not ordinarily fall within the scope of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act"). "In contrast, the allegation that a disabled prisoner has been denied [medical] services that have been provided to other prisoners"—in other words, that the plaintiff has been denied medical treatment entirely—"may state an ADA claim." Rashad, 4 F. App'x at 560; see also Moore v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., 201 F.3d 448, 1999 WL 1079848, at *1 (10th Cir. 1999) (Table decision) (finding the ADA and Rehabilitation Act afford disabled persons rights to programs and activities enjoyed by all, not a general cause of action for challenging the medical treatment of underlying disabilities (collecting cases)).
The Court agrees with Defendant that to the extent Plaintiff's ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims are premised on inadequate mental health treatment, those claims fail. Plaintiff alleges that "Defendants never attempted to obtain a court order which would have permitted them to administer anti-psychotic medications nor did they ever attempt to forcibly medicate [Plaintiff]." [#1, ¶ 1; see also id. at ¶¶ 84, 86] Though Plaintiff also claims that Defendants left [*24]  his psychosis "completely untreated" [id. at ¶ 45; see also id. at ¶ 1], those allegations are contradicted by other statements in the Complaint. For example, Plaintiff notes that he was periodically taken from the jail to the state mental hospital or affiliated treatment centers throughout 2016. [Id. at ¶ 3] Plaintiff also recounts several instances where he was seen and evaluated by mental health workers, and prescribed anti-psychotic medication. [Id. at ¶¶ 25, 29, 36-37, 39, 47-48] Plaintiff's allegations make clear that he takes issue with the nature and extent of his mental health treatment—not with the failure of jail staff to provide him medical care afforded to other inmates. [See, e.g., id. at ¶ 1 ("[Plaintiff] is now completely and permanently blind because the Defendants . . . exhibited deliberate indifference to his serious medical need for mental health treatment."); id. at ¶ 86 ("Knowing [Plaintiff] suffered from this debilitating serious mental illness and posed a severe danger to himself, no one ever sought forced medications.")] Courts have determined that such allegations give rise to Eighth Amendment, not ADA claims. Rashad, 4 F. App'x at 560; Moore, 201 F.3d 448, 1999 WL 1079848, at *1. And here, Judge Arguello has dismissed Plaintiff's deliberate [*25]  indifference claims arising under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. [See generally #108]
For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff's ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims fail to the extent they are premised on inadequate treatment of Plaintiff's mental health conditions.

C. Jail Staff's Interactions with Plaintiff
Defendant next argues that Plaintiff has failed to state an ADA claim based on discriminatory use of force, because he has failed to demonstrate how use of force against a mentally ill inmate constitutes discrimination, and because jail personnel's use of force was a response to Plaintiff's behavior, rather than his disability. [#119 at 10-12] Plaintiff responds that by using excessive force, officers failed to reasonably accommodate his disability by refusing to use tactics that would have minimized injury to Plaintiff and others. [#127 at 10-12] The Court finds that at this stage of the proceedings, Plaintiff has plausibly pleaded a failure to accommodate ADA claim based on jail staff's interactions with him, including their use of force and solitary confinement.
The Tenth Circuit has assumed, without deciding, that the ADA may require reasonable accommodations of an individual's disability [*26]  in the course of an investigation or arrest. J.H. ex rel. J.P. v. Bernalillo Cty., 806 F.3d 1255, 1261 (10th Cir. 2015). In conducting an investigation or arrest, officers may fail to reasonably accommodate a person's disability if they "caus[e] the person to suffer greater injury or indignity in that process than other arrestees." Gohier v. Enright, 186 F.3d 1216, 1220-21 (10th Cir. 1999); see also Buben v. City of Lone Tree, No. 08-cv-00127-WYD-MEH, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104853, 2010 WL 3894185, at *9 (D. Colo. Sept. 30, 2010). Two cases from the Ninth Circuit, which has explicitly adopted this rule, provide helpful examples.
In Sheehan v. City and County of San Francisco, officers responded to the plaintiff's group home to assist in transporting the plaintiff to a mental health facility for involuntary commitment. 743 F.3d 1211, 1215 (9th Cir. 2014), rev'd in part on other grounds, cert. dismissed in part, 575 U.S. 600, 135 S. Ct. 1765, 191 L. Ed. 2d 856 (2015). The plaintiff threatened officers with a knife, forcing them to retreat. Id. Officers then drew their weapons, forced their way into the plaintiff's room, and shot at her five or six times when the plaintiff again threatened them. Id. at 1216. The plaintiff claimed that the city failed to provide a reasonable accommodation when officers forced their way into her room without accounting for her mental illness, including respecting "her comfort zone, engag[ing] in non-threatening communications and us[ing] the passage of time to defuse the [*27]  situation rather than preciptat[e] a deadly confrontation." Id. at 1233. While acknowledging that "the officers were forced to make split-second decisions," the Ninth Circuit nevertheless determined that officers could have waited for backup and employed less confrontational tactics, including those suggested by the plaintiff. Id. The court denied the city's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the plaintiff's ADA claim. Id.
Similarly, in Lavenant v. City of Palm Springs, the court determined that the plaintiffs had identified sufficient facts in support of their ADA discrimination claims. No. EDCV 17-2267-KK, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133912, 2018 WL 3807944, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 8, 2018). There, the defendant officers failed to use protocols specifically created for handling encounters with mentally ill individuals during the plaintiff's arrest. Id. The court found that the officers knew or should have known that the plaintiff was experiencing a mental health crisis, yet still decided to engage with him, "further exacerbating his mental health crisis and creating an unnecessary altercation." Id.
The Court recognizes that interactions with inmates in the prison context present unique challenges, and that such encounters are distinct from investigations or arrests. But "[t]here [*28]  is no dispute that disabled individuals are entitled to reasonable accommodations during detention or incarceration." Ulibarri, 742 F. Supp. 2d at 1214. And courts have applied the same failure to accommodate test beyond the arrest context, finding ADA violations where defendants have caused inmates with disabilities to suffer greater injury or indignity than other prisoners. See, e.g., Edd v. Cty. of Placer, No. 2:14-cv-02739-JAM-AC, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50468, 2015 WL 1747394, at *3 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 16, 2015) (holding that forcing the plaintiff to remain without accommodations in a cell with a concrete floor or narrow metal bench, which would have caused discomfort to other prisoners but caused plaintiff actual pain due to his disabilities, "caused him to suffer greater injury or indignity than his cohorts"). In a similar case, Ramos v. Quiros, the plaintiff was a Department of Corrections ("DOC") inmate with a known, documented history of serious mental illness, including numerous suicide attempts and self-mutilation. No. 3:11-CV-1616 (RNC), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140749, 2012 WL 4501673, at *1 (D. Conn. Sept. 27, 2012). The court concluded that the plaintiff had plausibly pleaded an ADA claim where he alleged that DOC staff harassed him and retaliated against him for behavior caused by his mental illness. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140749, [WL] at *4. The plaintiff's allegations included that he was punished with disciplinary reports [*29]  after suicide attempts, was sprayed with mace and put into restraints after suicide attempts and self-harming, was placed in isolation which further aggravated his mental illness, and was continually sprayed with chemical agents while in isolation cells, including when he was restrained. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140749, [WL] at *2-*4. Similarly, in Wade v. Montgomery County, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her mental illness, including by placing her in solitary confinement due to her mental health problems and returning her to solitary confinement after a suicide attempt. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216522, 2017 WL 7058237, at *4. The court held that that plaintiff had plausibly pleaded that defendant's actions were discriminatory to inmates with mental illnesses.4 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216522, [WL] at *5, 7.
The Court is cognizant that the Tenth Circuit has left open the question of whether the ADA requires reasonable accommodations of a disability in the course of an arrest, and has not addressed whether officers must accommodate an individual's disability by ensuring that they do not cause that individual "to suffer greater injury or indignity" than other inmates once the individual is in custody. Gohier, 186 F.3d at 1221. But in light of the foregoing case law, and because it is clear that the ADA applies [*30]  to prisoners, Yeskey, 524 U.S. at 210, the Court cannot foreclose such a claim at this juncture. Accepting Plaintiff's allegations as true, the Court finds that Plaintiff has plausibly pleaded that Defendant caused him greater injury and indignities than other inmates through jail staff's use of force and solitary confinement.
Plaintiff alleges that officers "repeatedly used excessive force against an uncomprehending [Plaintiff], regularly tasing and punching him, leaving him bloodied, in pain, and tortured." [#1 at ¶ 5] For example, after observing Plaintiff attempting to gouge his eyes out, deputies put Plaintiff in a restraint chair with a "spit sock" over his head, though Plaintiff had been compliant and not spitting. [Id. at ¶ 28] Plaintiff then began spitting at deputies through the sock, and Sergeant Mitchell tased Plaintiff. [Id.] On another occasion, when Plaintiff forced himself to vomit, six deputies approached Plaintiff in full riot gear, pinned Plaintiff against a wall yelling "Get down!", and placed Plaintiff in a restraint chair with a spit sock forced over his head. [Id. at ¶ 32] In December 2016, Plaintiff had been lying naked and non-responsive with only a blanket covering him for several [*31]  days. [Id. at ¶¶ 59-60] Deputy Clem and Sergeants Koger, Groff, and others planned to see if they could get Plaintiff to move. [Id. at ¶ 60] Officers entered the cell and Sergeant Groff pulled the blanket off of Plaintiff's body. [Id.] Plaintiff jumped up, screamed nonsense, and rushed toward the door, and officers responded by punching and tasing Plaintiff. [Id.] This was the third time Sergeant Koger had tased Plaintiff in less than two weeks. [Id.] The following day, on December 17, Deputy Smith slammed Plaintiff to the ground and Deputy Maumau tased Plaintiff, when Plaintiff was allegedly noncompliant with handcuff placement, though Plaintiff was blinded and covered in blood. [Id. at ¶ 72] Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants allowed him to "languish in solitary confinement" in response to his behavior—"a condition known to . . . significantly worsen mental illness." [Id. at ¶ 81]
The Court finds that these allegations plausibly plead that Defendant caused Plaintiff greater injury and indignities than other inmates. The allegations suggest that officers responded to manifestations of Plaintiff's mental illness with repeated violence and that they unnecessarily escalated interactions, [*32]  or created altercations with Plaintiff. See Sheehan, 743 F.3d at 1233; Lavenant, 2018 WL 3807944, at *5. Like the plaintiffs in Wade and Ramos, Plaintiff pleads that he was harassed and punished for behavior caused by his mental illness, including being tased while restrained or placed in solitary confinement, after self-harming behavior. Even if the standards articulated in Sheehan in the context of arresting mentally ill individuals, such as "respecting [an individual's] comfort zone," and allowing the passage of time to defuse the situation, would not be feasible in the prison setting, Plaintiff nevertheless plausibly pleads that officers could have accommodated him in other ways—such as not immediately resorting to violence, and not unnecessarily creating dangerous and violent confrontations, including when Plaintiff was alone in his cell and not acting as a threat, or was otherwise largely incapacitated.
Defendant argues that officers' use of force was in response to Plaintiff's behavior and non-compliance—rather than Plaintiff's mental illness. [#119 at 11-12] In J.V. v. Albuquerque Public Schools, the Tenth Circuit held that even if the plaintiff's conduct was a manifestation of his disability, such conduct "may be regulated, so long [*33]  as action is not taken by reason of the [plaintiff's] disability." 813 F.3d at 1296. In that case, a second grader with autism disrupted class, ran away from elementary school staff, kicked a social worker, and kicked and shot rubber bands at the school police officer multiple times. Id. at 1292-93. In response, the officer handcuffed the minor to a chair and repeatedly warned the minor to calm down. Id. at 1293-94. But J.V. is distinguishable because there, on summary judgment, appellants had "fail[ed] to cite any evidence showing [the student's] conduct indeed was a manifestation of his disability," and the officer who allegedly discriminated against the student was unaware of the student's disability. Id. at 1296; see also id. at 1292. Moreover, in that case, school staff had tried numerous strategies to manage the student's misbehavior prior to resorting to handcuffing, including speaking with the student's parents, bringing the student to a separate room, explaining to the student that he was threatening the safety of himself and others, asking the student to stop, and giving him multiple opportunities to do so. Id. at 1292-94. In contrast here, Plaintiff has pleaded extensive facts demonstrating that his behavior was a result of his mental health issues, [*34]  that officers were well-aware of his disability, and that officers made minimal, if any, attempts to take Plaintiff's mental health into account before escalating interactions with him.
Moreover, even accepting that at certain times, officers were responding to non-compliance by Plaintiff [see, e.g., #1, ¶¶ 24, 27, 53, 57, 72], and assuming that officers responded to that non-compliance without creating greater injury and indignities to Plaintiff than they would have in responding to non-compliance by other inmates, other allegations plausibly plead that certain actions were taken simply because of Plaintiff's mental illness. For example, Plaintiff alleges that officers: attempted to get him to move after several days of non-responsiveness by pulling a blanket off of his naked body; entered Plaintiff's cell with full riot gear and pinned him against a wall after he forced himself to vomit; and tased Plaintiff even after he had been restrained. [Id. at ¶¶ 28, 32, 60] Plaintiff further alleges "[i]t was almost a form of sport at the jail to provoke [him] and then inflict pain upon him for his psychotically motivated response." [Id. at ¶ 86]
For the foregoing reasons, and cognizant that [*35]  whether an entity failed to provide a reasonable accommodation under the ADA is generally a question of fact, Tabura, 880 F.3d at 555, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's allegations with respect to interactions with jail personnel, including officers' use of excessive force and placing Plaintiff in solitary confinement, plausibly plead a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.

D. Failure to Train
In his Response in opposition to the instant Motion, Plaintiff argues that he states an ADA claim based on Defendant's failure to properly train its officers on appropriate conduct with severely mentally ill detainees. [#127 at 12-14] Defendant responds that because Plaintiff has not stated an underlying ADA claim, Plaintiff's failure to train theory also fails. [#128 at 5-7] The Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations support a failure to train claim in violation of the ADA.
The Tenth Circuit "has not recognized a failure-to-train claim of discrimination under the ADA, but [has] not foreclosed the possibility." J.V., 813 F.3d at 1297. In Gohier v. Enright, the Tenth Circuit noted that appellant "might have argued that Title II required Colorado Springs to better train its police officers to recognize reported [*36]  disturbances that are likely to involve persons with mental disabilities, and to investigate and arrest such persons in a manner reasonably accommodating their disability." 186 F.3d at 1222; see also id. at 1221 (noting that "[i]n order to comply with the non-discrimination mandate, it is often necessary to [train] public employees about disability," such as how to recognize and help people having seizures). But because appellant had disavowed such a theory, the court declined to analyze its application to the facts of the case. Id. at 1222.
This District has also recognized the potential viability of an ADA failure to trail claim. In Buben v. City of Lone Tree, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant city "should have adopted policies to accommodate disabled individuals such as Plaintiff, and should have properly trained its officer to recognize and reasonably accommodate individuals exhibiting signs of excited delirium, mental illness or disability." 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104853, 2010 WL 3894185, at *12 (quotation omitted). There, officers responded to a complaint of criminal mischief involving the plaintiff, who was mentally ill. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104853, [WL] at *1. During the ensuing altercation, officers tased the plaintiff multiple times and struck him with a baton, and the plaintiff ultimately fell [*37]  off a balcony. Id. The court explained that notwithstanding any exigent circumstances that may have existed when the individual officers responded, the "non-compliance with the training requirements of the ADA did not occur" on the day of the altercation, but rather "when the Defendant policymakers failed to institute polices to accommodate disabled individuals such as Plaintiff by giving the officers the tools and resources to handle the situation peacefully." 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104853, [WL] at *12 (quotation omitted). The city admitted that it "d[id] not have a specific policy directed to the handling of mentally impaired individuals" and this District denied the city's motion for summary judgment and allowed the plaintiff's ADA failure to train claim to proceed. Id.
For the reasons stated above, the Court agrees with Defendant that to the extent Plaintiff's failure to train theory is premised on deliberate indifference to his mental health needs, such claims do not state an ADA claim and, again, Plaintiff's deliberate indifference claims have been dismissed in their entirety by Judge Arguello. Nevertheless, the Court finds that Plaintiff has otherwise plausibly pleaded an ADA failure to train claim.
As discussed above, [*38]  Plaintiff has stated an underlying ADA failure to accommodate claim, based on his allegations with respect to jail staff using excessive force and placing him in solitary confinement. Moreover, Plaintiff states that Defendant "failed (and continues to fail) to properly train, supervise and/or discipline its employees regarding the proper treatment of, and accommodations for, individuals with disabilities and, in particular, mental disabilities." [Id. at ¶ 204] While that allegation itself is conclusory, Plaintiff's claim that jail personnel were ill-equipped to handle interactions with mentally ill inmates is supported by the allegations discussed above—including officers' violent or punitive conduct in response to Plaintiff lying naked and unresponsive in his cell, forcing himself to vomit, and gouging his eyes out. [Id. at ¶¶ 32, 60, 81] Plaintiff further claims that "Defendant supervisory personnel at [BCJ] have public[ly] admitted they cannot handle mentally ill inmates." [Id. at ¶ 89; see also id. at ¶¶ 90-92] From the foregoing allegations the Court concludes that Plaintiff has plausibly pleaded that Defendant failed to train officers on how to appropriately respond to mentally [*39]  ill inmates and failed to provide appropriate tools and resources for working with mentally ill inmates, in order to accommodate those individuals under the ADA.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [#119] be DENIED and that Claims 11 and 12 of the Complaint be allowed to proceed.5
