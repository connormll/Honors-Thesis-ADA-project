Opinion



ORDER
Presently before the Court is Plaintiff Dawn Hampson's motion in limine. (Dkt. No. 69).1 As filed, the motion in limine sought to: (1) preclude Defendant State Farm from introducing any evidence regarding her "claims for Social Security Disability Insurance ('SSDI'), Supplemental Security Income ('SSI'), and/or unemployment compensation", as well as her receipt of SSDI benefits; (2) permit the trial or deposition testimony of her doctors, Dr. Eugene Merecki and Dr. Bruno P. Tolge, as well as her medical records; (3) permit testimony from Plaintiff regarding her emotional stress damages and medical diagnosis; (4) permit deposition testimony from State Farm employees Lori Ercolini and Rene Streicher, in the event that they are not available to testify at trial; (5) permit emails from State Farm employees as evidence regarding Plaintiff's job performance; (6) exclude any evidence [*2]  that Defendant was not aware of Plaintiff's disability/serious medical condition; (7) exclude any evidence that Plaintiff did not file the appropriate written application in order to request a reasonable accommodation; (8) exclude any evidence that Plaintiff's proposed accommodation would have been an undue hardship; and (9) exclude any information about claims that this Court dismissed on summary judgment. (See Dkt. No. 69). At a pretrial conference on October 14, 2015, the parties indicated that requests numbered 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 were either withdrawn or moot.2 As to request number 2, the parties indicated that they would attempt to resolve any issues between themselves before a follow-up conference on October 22, 2014. Thus, the only requests presently at issue are those numbered 1, 5, and 7.
On October 21, 2015, the parties filed supplemental briefs addressing, inter alia, whether testimony by State Farm employees Lori Ercolini and Rene Streicher should be permitted at trial. (Dkt. Nos. 99 and 101). As Defendant stated in its memorandum of law in opposition to Plaintiff's motion in limine, "[i]t is undisputed that Ms. Ercolini was a Nurse Reviewer . . . and that her responsibilities [*3]  materially differed from those of an Auto Claims Representative. . . ." (Dkt. No. 92, p. 17). Streicher, meanwhile, was "in a higher level position than Plaintiff and had additional work, [and] testified without contradiction that her work from home consisted only of occasionally bringing work home to complete after work hours . . . ." (Id.). Defendant argues that the testimony of those two witnesses "is not probative on the issue for which it is offered - i.e., to demonstrate that telecommuting was feasible and consistent with the responsibilities of an Auto Claim Representative such as Plaintiff." (Dkt. No. 99, p. 4). Plaintiff argues that Lori Ercolini's testimony is "highly probative" on the issue of whether Plaintiff's request to work from home "would have imposed an undue burden on the impact of [Defendant's] operations and unreasonable costs." (Dkt. No. 101, p. 4). The Court agrees that the testimony is relevant. Although neither witness held the same position that Plaintiff held, their testimony regarding accommodations made to permit them to work at home provides some evidence regarding whether allowing Plaintiff to work from home periodically would have imposed an undue hardship [*4]  on Defendant. Any danger of unfair prejudice to Defendant or jury confusion is outweighed by the probative value of the testimony. The Court therefore denies Defendant's request to exclude Ercolini and Streicher's testimony at trial.
The Court has reviewed and considered the parties' supplemental submissions, filed on October 21, 2015. See Dkt. Nos. 99 and 101. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies in part and grants in part request number 1, and denies request number 7. The admissibility of emails that Plaintiff seeks to introduce at trial, request number 5, will depend upon whether Plaintiff lays a proper foundation at trial.

I. Request Number 1 - Evidence Regarding Application for/Receipt of SSDI Benefits3
Plaintiff seeks to preclude Defendant State Farm from introducing any evidence regarding her claims for Social Security Disability Insurance ('SSDI') and her receipt of SSDI benefits.

a. Plaintiff's SSDI Application
An ADA claim and an application for SSDI benefits "do not inherently conflict." Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 802, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999). "An ADA suit claiming that the plaintiff can perform her job with reasonable accommodation may well prove consistent with an SSDI claim that the plaintiff could not perform her own [*5]  job (or other jobs) without it." Id. at 803. A plaintiff, however, "must proffer a sufficient explanation for any apparent contradiction arising out of an application for SSDI benefits," Alford v. Turbine Airfoil Coating & Repair, LLC, No. 12 Civ. 7539 (DLC), 2014 WL 1516336, at *7, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53692, at *20-21 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 17, 2014) (citation omitted). An ADA plaintiff "cannot simply ignore her SSDI contention that she was too disabled to work." Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 798.
In her SSDI application dated May 30, 2011, Plaintiff answered "yes" in response to the question: "[d]uring the last 14 months [were you] unable to work because of illnesses, injuries or conditions that have lasted or are expected to last at least 12 months or can be expected to result in death[?]" (Dkt. No. 96-1, p. 13). Plaintiff stated that she was unable to work as of April 20, 2011. (Id.). She listed her "[i]llnesses, injuries, [or] conditions that limit ability to work" as "major depressive disorder, fibromyalgia, chronic migraine," and stated that those illnesses, injuries and conditions were related to work. (Id., p. 16). When asked whether she was "[n]ow able to work" she answered: "No." (Id.). In the "remarks" section of the application, Plaintiff wrote: "State Farm Insurance fired me because I had too many absences that could not be covered under FMLA because I had used all of my allotted FMLA [*6]  days due to my ongoing disabilities." (Dkt. No. 96-1, p. 16).
In her "adult disability report" dated June 11, 2011, Plaintiff stated that she stopped working on April 20, 2011, and listed her "[r]eason for stopping" as: "Because of my condition AND other reasons." (Id.). She explained her "other reasons" as follows: "I was let go of due to missing too much time from work due to my health issues." (Id. at p. 27). She stated that her condition had become "severe enough to stop working" on April 14, 2007. (Id.).
In her motion in limine, Plaintiff argues that her SSDI application is "not probative of whether [she] could perform the essential functions at State Farm with the reasonable accommodation of periodic telecommuting." (Dkt. No. 69, p. 3). The Court disagrees. Statements Plaintiff made in connection with her application for SSDI benefits may be relevant to whether she is qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, either with or without a reasonable accommodation. See Lupe v. Shinseki, No. 1:10-CV-198 (MAD/ATB), 2013 WL 592669, at *3, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19690, at *8 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2013) ("Plaintiff is not barred from pursuing her ADA claim, however, the SSA application is relevant evidence at trial."). The jury will be permitted to consider the statements that Plaintiff [*7]  made in her application, and will determine whether they directly conflict with Plaintiff's ADA and NYHRL claims. See DeCaro v. Hasbro, Inc., 580 F.3d 55, 62 (1st Cir. 2009) ("The point of the Cleveland decision is that [a plaintiff's statements in an application for benefits] may or may not be inimical to an employment discrimination claim. Everything depends on interpretation: how jurors view the statements . . . in the context of the overall situation."); see also Finan v. Good Earth Tools, Inc., 565 F.3d 1076, 1079 (8th Cir. 2009) (affirming district court's denial of motion for judgment as a matter of law following jury verdict for the plaintiff, when the plaintiff had "sufficiently explained any apparent contradiction between his social security and ADA claims").
Plaintiff also argues that admission of her SSDI application would create "a substantial risk of undue prejudice" by "confus[ing] the jury." (Dkt. No. 69, p. 3). The issue regarding whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation, is one of the central issues in this case. Thus, the Court finds that the probative value of the statements contained in Plaintiff's SSDI application outweighs the risk of undue prejudice, confusion of the issues or misleading the jury. See Lupe, 2013 WL 592669, at *3, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19690, at *7; Fed. R. Evid. 403. The jury [*8]  may be instructed on the proper use of this evidence. See 5-88A-14 Modern Federal Jury Instructions (2015).
Although Plaintiff also raised a hearsay objection to the SSDI evidence in her motion in limine, at the pretrial conference, Plaintiff's counsel stated that there was no dispute that Plaintiff completed the application form, and acknowledged that the application is a party admission. See Lupe v. Shinseki, 2013 WL 592669, at *4, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19690, at *12 (noting that the plaintiff's statements in a Social Security application could be admitted as admissions of a party opponent, under Rule 801(d)(2) of the Federal Rules of Evidence).

b. Social Security Administration Determination and Plaintiff's Receipt of Benefits
Plaintiff argues that evidence of her receipt of SSDI benefits "for purposes of mitigating a damages award against the defendant is irrelevant and prejudicial," and that the Court should exclude such evidence under the collateral source rule. (Dkt. No. 69, p. 4). For the reasons that follow, Defendant is precluded from introducing evidence as to the Social Security Administration's ("SSA") determination that Plaintiff was disabled and Plaintiff's receipt of SSDI benefits, with the caveat that Defendant may introduce evidence as to Plaintiff's receipt of SSDI benefits if Plaintiff [*9]  brings her financial status into issue at trial.4

i. Evidence Regarding SSA Determination and Receipt as it Relates to "Qualified Individual" Status
Defendant argues that the SSA's determination that Plaintiff was disabled is relevant to "whether Plaintiff was a qualified individual under the ADA," as well as whether she was "able to work during the periods for which she seeks back pay and front pay." (Dkt. No. 92, pp. 8-9). As a preliminary matter, nothing in the SSDI file which defendant seeks to admit explains the SSA's disability determination. The records show merely that Plaintiff was scheduled for a doctor's appointment on October 20, 2011, and that on December 4, 2011, the SSA sent Plaintiff a letter stating "[w]e found that you became disabled under our rules on April 20, 2011." (Dkt. No. 96-1, p. 40). On January 18, 2013, the SSA sent Plaintiff a letter stating "[w]e looked again at the evidence in your Social Security disability claim and found that your disability is continuing." (Dkt. No. 96-1, p. 1).
In any event, even if the SSA determination was explained, the probative value of that determination is limited, [*10]  as it applied a different standard than will apply to determining whether Plaintiff is a "qualified individual" under federal and state law. See Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 803. The Court agrees with Plaintiff that the probative value of the SSA's determination of disability is outweighed by the significant danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues and misleading the jury. "Because [the "qualified individual"] issue is so pivotal to the outcome of this trial, any other determination stating that Plaintiff is, or is not 'disabled,' based on a different standard would only serve to confuse and mislead the jury. This confusion would outweigh any probative value." Chavez v. Waterford Sch. Dist., No. 09-12336, 2011 WL 887784, at *3, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25758, at *6 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 14, 2011) (in suit under ADA and Michigan law, holding that the plaintiff's Social Security long-term disability determinations were not admissible because their probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice). See Lawson v. CSX Transp., 245 F.3d 916, 933 (7th Cir. 2001) (noting that admitting the SSA's disability determination in an ADA case "would send district courts (and juries) on a lot of byways," explaining the SSA's standards and proceedings, and "Cleveland suggests that this is a path best avoided") (Easterbrook, J. concurring); cf. Rafferty v. Erhard, 09CV1019, 2012 WL 3518565, at *2, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95413, at *6 (W.D.N.Y. July 10, 2012) (in personal [*11]  injury action, holding that SSA's determination of disability was "of limited probative value" to the jury, and was "unduly prejudicial and inadmissible pursuant to Rule 403"). The Court therefore grants Plaintiff's request to exclude the SSA's determination that she was disabled. Defendant will have the opportunity to prove that Plaintiff was disabled (and therefore ineligible for back pay); however, it will not be permitted to introduce evidence of the SSA's disability determination in order to do so.

ii. Evidence Regarding SSA Determination and Receipt of Benefits as it Relates to Back Pay Award
It is settled law that plaintiff cannot recover front or back pay for periods for which she is unable to work due to a disability. See Saulpaugh v. Monroe Cmty. Hosp., 4 F.3d 134, 144 (2d Cir. 1993) (holding that a Title VII plaintiff could not recover back pay for period during which she was unable to work due to disability); Schlant v. Victor Belata Belting Co., No. 94-CV-0915E(SC), 2000 WL 1737945, at *1, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16977, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2000) ("[B]ecause a plaintiff is only entitled to be compensated for injuries suffered as a direct result of the discrimination, back pay is not available for any period during which the plaintiff was disabled. The reasoning underlying this rule is that a person would not be entitled to salary [*12]  while disabled and thus wages lost during such period are not the result of the discrimination.") (internal citations omitted). "The complete disability required for a grant of SSDI benefits is incompatible with back pay, which may only be awarded where a plaintiff' suffered losses as a result of defendant's discrimination,' and not 'when a plaintiff would have been unable, due to an intervening disability, to continue employment.'" Morse v. JetBlue Airways Corp., No. 09-CV-5075 KAM MDG, 2014 WL 2587576, at *5, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78778, at *13 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2014) (quoting Thornley v. Penton Publ., 104 F.3d 26, 31 (2d Cir. 1997)).
Although there is tension between the SSA's determination that Plaintiff was disabled (and therefore entitled to benefits) and Plaintiff's contention that she could have performed her job with a reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff may be able to explain how it would be possible for her to work at State Farm even while considered "disabled" for SSDI purposes. As the Supreme Court recognized in Cleveland, the receipt of SSDI benefits and the ability to work are not always mutually exclusive. See 526 U.S. at 805. In fact, the record indicates that Plaintiff did work for a period of six months following her termination from State Farm, during a time when the SSA considered her disability "ongoing." (Dkt. No. 96-1, p. 49). [*13]  Thus, Plaintiff's receipt of SSDI benefits is not a per se bar to an award of back pay.

iii. Evidence Regarding Receipt of Benefits as it Relates to Plaintiff's Financial Status and Alleged Failure to Mitigate Damages
Records in the SSDI file indicate that Plaintiff's monthly disability payment was initially $1,794. (Dkt. No. 96-1, p. 40). On September 2, 2013, the SSA sent Plaintiff a letter notifying her that her insurance began on October 2013, and that her monthly benefit would be $1,720. (Dkt. No. 96-1, p. 61).
Under the collateral source rule, evidence of collateral benefits a plaintiff has received is typically inadmissible. Santa Maria v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., 81 F.3d 265, 272-73 (2d Cir. 1996) (citing Eichel v. N.Y. Cent. R. Co., 375 U.S. 253, 255, 84 S. Ct. 316, 11 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1963)). The rationale for this rule is that "the likelihood of misuse by the jury clearly outweighs the value of this evidence." Eichel, 375 U.S. at 255. In Eichel, the Supreme Court held that a district court properly excluded evidence of disability payments which was offered as evidence of the plaintiff's motive to not return to work. The Supreme Court noted that, "[i]nsofar as the evidence bears on the issue of malingering, there will generally be other evidence having more probative value and involving less likelihood of prejudice than the receipt of" disability benefits. [*14]  Id. Evidence of collateral benefits "may be admissible," however, "if the plaintiff puts his financial status at issue." Santa Maria, 81 F.3d at 272-73 (citing Lange v. Missouri P. R. Co., 703 F.2d 322, 324 (8th Cir. 1983)); Ebert v. City of New York, No. 04 Civ. 9971(LMM), 2006 WL 3627103, at *4, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43337, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2006). In Lange, for example, the Eighth Circuit upheld the admission of evidence of "workmen's compensation" benefits on cross examination after the plaintiff had testified that "he had to return to work immediately after the surgery because he had no disability income." 703 F.2d at 324. As Defendant notes, Eichel does not require a per se exclusion of evidence of collateral benefits, such as disability benefits: a district court may admit such evidence where its probative value outweighs the danger of prejudice. See Mills v. Energy Transp. Corp., 29 F. App'x 744, 745 (2d Cir. 2002) ("Eichel does not establish an absolute bar against the admission of [collateral benefits] evidence for purposes other than mitigation of damages."); McGrath, 136 F.3d 838, 841 (1st Cir. 1998) ("We do not read Eichel as requiring the per se exclusion of collateral source evidence in FELA cases. . . . Rule 403 confers broad discretion upon the district court to weigh unfair prejudice against probative value") (internal quotation marks, punctuation, and citation omitted).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's receipt of SSDI benefits is relevant to her financial condition because her claims of emotional distress [*15]  are based, in part, on financial stress and the SSDI benefits cover medical insurance, which she claims to have lost. (Dkt, No. 92, p. 5). Defendant also argues that the SSDI benefits are relevant to Plaintiff's financial condition and her alleged failure to mitigate because: (1) Plaintiff asserts that she left her mitigating employment and moved to Michigan for financial reasons; and (2) had Plaintiff continued to work, she no longer would have been eligible for SSDI benefits. (Dkt. No. 92, pp. 12-13).
In Steinherr v. CSX Transp., Inc., , the court rejected the defendant's argument that disability benefits were admissible to show that the plaintiff had "an incentive and the financial means to malinger." No. 1:10-CV-0891(MAD), 2011 WL 6132293, at *1, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141114, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2011). The court noted that: "When faced with an analogous argument, the majority of Circuit and district Courts have applied the Eichel doctrine and precluded the admission of collateral benefits." Steinherr, 2011 WL 6132293, at *2, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141114, at *4-5 (citing Sheehy v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., 631 F.2d 649 (9th Cir. 1980); Finley v. AMTRAK, 1 F. Supp. 2d 440, 443 (E.D. Penn. 1998); Edsall v. CSX Transp., Inc., 2008 WL 244344, at *2, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6247, at *4 (N.D. Ind. Jan. 28, 2008); Davis v. CSX Transp., Inc., 2008 WL 2117151, at *2, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108204, at *4-5 (E.D. Tenn. May 20, 2008); Prater v. CONRAIL, 272 F. Supp. 2d 706, 716 (N.D. Ohio 2003)). The court noted that other courts in the Circuit have determined that collateral benefits evidence is admissible where the plaintiff puts his or her financial status at issue, and concluded: "[A]t this juncture, plaintiff's motion in limine to preclude the admissibility [*16]  of evidence relating to RRB benefits is granted. However, this ruling is subject to reconsideration based upon the evidence at trial." Steinherr, 2011 WL 6132293, at *3, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141114, at *8.
Similarly, in this case the Court finds that the danger of unfair prejudice from the admission of Plaintiff's receipt of SSDI benefits for the purpose of showing her alleged motivation for not returning to work outweighs the probative value of the evidence, and precludes Defendant from introducing evidence of the SSDI benefits for that purpose. At this point, absent Plaintiff's trial testimony, or a proffer of Plaintiff's trial testimony, it is premature to consider whether the receipt of SSDI benefits may be admissible regarding Plaintiff's financial status or medical insurance coverage. If Plaintiff opens the door to this evidence it may become admissible. See, e.g., Lange, 703 F.2d at 323-24.

II. Request Number 5 - Emails Regarding Job Performance
Plaintiff argues that various emails from State Farm employees regarding her work performance (Dkt. Nos. 30-3 through 30-8) "demonstrate that Hampson was a productive, capable Claims Representative . . . ." (Dkt. No. 69, p. 7). The emails are messages that Plaintiff received from other employees at State Farm, complimenting her [*17]  performance on certain work tasks and thanking her for her help, with statements including: "Keep up the great work Dawn!!!!!!!" (Dkt. No. 30-3); "Thank you for all of your hard work in Kevin's queue this week." (Dkt. No. 30-4); "Thank you so much for your assistance and dedication to helping our metro teams!" (Dkt. No. 30-5); and "I can't thank you enough for your assistance in my queue while I was out — You did an amazing job and I appreciate it!" (Dkt. No. 30-7).
Plaintiff asserts that the emails are "relevant and probative on State Farm's defense, as they review Dawn Hampson's performance at and near the time that she was being told by her direct supervisor that she was 'unreliable.'" (Id.). Defendant argues that the emails are not relevant because they "do not address the performance issue that is relevant to this case — Plaintiff's lack of reliable and consistent attendance." (Dkt. No. 92, p. 18). Although the emails do not address the attendance issue, they are relevant to whether Plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of her job.
Plaintiff offers the emails in question for the truth of the matter asserted in each of them, rendering them subject to hearsay objections. [*18]  See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). Plaintiff argues that the emails are not hearsay, however, because they are (1) admissions of a party opponent; (2) records of a regularly conducted activity; (3) present sense impressions; or (4) excited utterances. (Dkt. 69, p. 8). Defendant argues that the emails do not fall within any of these hearsay exceptions. (Dkt. No. 92, p. 18).

a. Party Admissions
A statement offered against an opposing party is not hearsay if, inter alia, it "was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed." Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).5
The D.C. Circuit has explained:
In the employment discrimination context, the circuit courts of appeal [to have ruled on this issue] have held that Rule 801(d)(2)(D) requires only that the declarant have some authority to speak on matters of hiring or promotion or that the declarant be involved in the decision-making process in general. This, along with evidence that the statements were made during the existence of the employment relationship and relate to the challenged action, is sufficient to allow the statements into evidence as party admissions.
Talavera v. Shah, 638 F.3d 303, 309, 395 U.S. App. D.C. 7 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); see also Stephens v. Erickson, 569 F.3d 779 (7th Cir. 2009) ("For an agent's statements regarding an employment action to constitute an admission, [*19]  she need not have been personally involved in that action, but her duties must encompass some responsibility related to 'the decisionmaking process affecting the employment action.'") (quoting Simple v. Walgreen Co., 511 F.3d 668, 672 (7th Cir. 2007)); Jaramillo v. Colo. Judicial Dep't, 427 F.3d 1303, 1314 (10th Cir. 2005) (holding that statements by someone not involved in hiring or promotion were not party admissions); E.E.O.C. v. Watergate at Landmark Condo., 24 F.3d 635 (4th Cir. 1994) ("Significant involvement, either as advisor or other participant in a process leading to a challenged decision, may suffice to establish 'agency' for this purpose; it is not necessary that the declarant be the actual final decisionmaker.").
Courts in the Second Circuit have also determined that in the employment discrimination context, a statement can only be a party admission where the speaker played some role in the employment decision-making process. See E.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., 778 F. Supp. 2d 458, 466 n.6 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (holding that statements made by coworkers or other individuals "with no decision-making authority relevant to the claims" were not "within the scope of the employment" of those declarants, and thus were not party admissions); Evans v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 192 F. Supp. 2d 247, 264 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (holding that statements by co-worker could not be party admissions where there was no evidence that the speaker "was plaintiff's supervisor, that he played a role in any relevant decision-making process, or that [*20]  his alleged statement to plaintiff was related in any way to his duties for the Authority"); see also United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 661 (2d Cir. 1996) (in criminal appeal by defendant sheriff, holding that statements of deputies' supervisors concerning "the threat of suspension or termination for failure to pay dues" were admissible as the defendant's admissions, and stating: "[T]he declarant need not be the 'final decisionmaker' on employment matters for his statement on those matters to be deemed within the scope of his agency. Rather, he need only be an advisor or other significant participant in the decision-making process that is the subject matter of the statement."); Cook v. Arrowsmith Shelburne, Inc., 69 F.3d 1235, 1238 n.1 (2d Cir. 1995) (holding, in case asserting, inter alia, gender discrimination, that statement by general manager, relayed to plaintiff by her supervisors, was admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D)).
Plaintiff asserts that each of the emails was "sent by an employee/agent of State Farm." (Dkt. No. 69, p. 8). Plaintiff does not assert, however, that the statements made within the emails were "within the scope of" the employment or agency relationship between each of the email writers and State Farm. Further, Plaintiff has not alleged that the individuals who wrote the emails played any part in the [*21]  employment decision-making process at State Farm. Absent that foundational evidence, the emails are not admissible as party admissions

b. Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity
The hearsay exception for records of a regularly conducted activity, formerly and commonly known as the "business records" exception, appears at Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). It applies to:
A record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis if:
(A) the record was made at or near the time by--or from information transmitted by--someone with knowledge;
(B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business, organization, occupation, or calling, whether or not for profit;
(C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity;
(D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, or by a certification that complies with Rule 902(11) or (12) or with a statute permitting certification; and
(E) the opponent does not show that the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.
Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). Plaintiff contends that the emails she seeks to admit fall within this exception because "each was kept in the course of State Farm's regular [*22]  business and making the record was its regular practice." (Dkt. No. 69, p. 8).
The argument that emails are "kept as a 'regular operation of the business' is simply insufficient on that basis alone to establish a foundation for admission under Rule 803(6)(B)." United States v. Cone, 714 F.3d 197, 220 (4th Cir. 2013). Rather, emails must be held to the same standard as other documents under the records of a regularly conducted activity exception. See Rogers v. Oregon Trail Elec. Consumers Co-Op., Inc., No. 3:10-CV-1337-AC, 2012 WL 1635127, at *10, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65883, at *27 (D. Or. May 8, 2012). "Whether a particular record qualifies for the exception hinges upon the content and preparation of the record." In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, on Apr. 20, 2010, No. MDL 2179, 2012 WL 85447, at *2, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3406, at *9 (E.D. La. Jan. 11, 2012) ("Deepwater Horizon"); see also It's My Party, Inc. v. Live Nation, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119625, 2012 WL 3655470 (D. Md. Aug. 23, 2012) ("I decline to accept a blanket rule that emails constitute business records; more specificity is required regarding the party's recordkeeping practices to show that a particular email in fact constitutes a reliable business record.").
As the Eastern District of Louisiana explained:
[T]he email must have been sent or received in the course of a regular business activity, which requires a case-by-case analysis of whether the producing defendant had a policy or imposed a business duty on its employee to report [*23]  or record the information within the email. [Also], it must be the producing defendant's regular practice to send or receive emails that record the type of event(s) documented in the email. This would require proof of a policy of the producing defendant to use email to make certain types of reports or to send certain sorts of communications; it is not enough to say that as a general business matter, most companies receive and send emails as part of their business model.
Deepwater Horizon, 2012 WL 85447 at *3, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3406, at *12-16 (internal footnotes omitted).
Here, the only support for Plaintiff's argument that the emails in question are records of a regularly conducted activity is her statement that "each was kept in the course of State Farm's regular business and making the record was its regular practice." (Dkt. No. 69, p. 8). Plaintiff does not offer any basis upon which the Court could conclude that the emails were sent because State Farm had a policy or imposed a business duty on its employees requiring them to report the information contained in the emails. See Deepwater Horizon, 2012 WL 85447 at *3, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3406, at *13. In fact, the emails do not appear to be reporting any information whatsoever, and rather are simply the sort of sentiments which coworkers may, but are not obligated to, exchange [*24]  from time to time. The casual nature of the emails indicates that they are more akin to telephone calls than to records of a regularly conducted activity. See In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, on Apr. 20, 2010, 2012 WL 423862, at *2, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16847, at *7 (E.D. La. Feb. 8, 2012) (determining that an email did not fall within the "business records" exception where the email's content "demonstrat[ed] that it was sent casually"), report recommendation adopted, 2012 WL 441134, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16846 (Feb. 10, 2012). Absent the requisite foundational evidence, they are not admissible under 803(6).

c. Present Sense Impressions or Excited Utterances
Under Fed. R. Evid. 803, a present sense impression is "[a] statement describing or explaining an event or condition, made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it." Fed. R. Evid. 803(1). An excited utterance is "[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that it caused." Fed. R. Evid. 803(2). Neither a present sense impression nor an excited utterance is a hearsay statement. Fed. R. Evid. 803. Plaintiff argues that the emails are admissible under either hearsay exclusion because they are "effectively commenting on Hampson's job performance within a short period after she did the work. Each one of these State Farm [*25]  employees is contemporaneously exclaiming via email, about the quality of Hampson's ability, right after she worked for them in their respective groups." (Dkt. No. 69, p. 8). Defendant argues that the emails do not constitute present sense impressions because Plaintiff has not provided evidence that the emails were written contemporaneously with, or immediately after, Plaintiff's work, and are not limited to a present sense declaration of facts or an occurrence. (Dkt. No. 92, pp. 19-20). It also argues that the emails are not excited utterances, because "Plaintiff provides no evidence of . . . stress or excitement" having caused the statements contained in the emails. (Id., p. 20).
Emails can qualify as present sense impressions or excited utterances. Lorraine v. Markel Am. Ins. Co., 241 F.R.D. 534, 569 (D. Md. 2007).
There are three elements that must be met for [the present sense impression] exception to apply: (1) the declarant must have personally perceived the event that is described in the statement; (2) the statement must be a simple explanation or description of the event perceived; and (3) the declaration and the event described must be contemporaneous. Present sense impressions are considered trustworthy because the near simultaneous expression of [*26]  the explanation or description of the event with its perception militates against any memory deficiency, or opportunity to intentionally misstate what occurred.
Id. (internal citations omitted). Where an email satisfies the requirements applicable to present sense impressions, it falls within that exception. See United States v. Ferber, 966 F. Supp. 90, 98 (D. Mass. 1997) (holding that email was present sense impression where it was prepared "shortly after[]" a telephone call to which it referred, and citing to cases recognizing exception with gaps of 10 minutes and 23 minutes between event and statement) (citing United States v. Blakey, 607 F.2d 779, 785 (7th Cir. 1979); Miller v. Crown Amusements, Inc., 821 F. Supp. 703, 706-707 (S.D. Ga. 1993)).
The present sense impression exception does not apply when the declaration is not made immediately after the event. See United States v. Hill, No. 12-CR-214(KAM), 2014 WL 198813, at *4, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5364, at *13 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2014) (holding that statement made two days after shooting would not fall within present sense impression exception); Obey v. Frisco Med. Ctr., L.L.P., No. 4:13-CV-656, 2015 WL 417509, at *2, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10661, at *6-7 (E.D. Tex. Jan. 30, 2015) (holding that present sense impression exception did not apply to statements reflected in letter where "[t]wo days passed between the time the statements were made and the letter was written"); Weinstein v. Siemens, No. 2:07-CV-15000, 2010 WL 4790915, at *2, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121601, at *7-8 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 17, 2010) (holding that telephone call could not "be construed as a present sense impression of the caller when the call was received [*27]  two days after the accident and thus could not possibly have been a statement describing an event while the caller was perceiving the event, or immediately thereafter").
As to the excited utterance exception, "[t]he critical inquiry is whether the declarant was still under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition when she made the challenged statement." Mohamed v. Laz Parking, 79 F. App'x 482, 483 (2d Cir. 2003). The rationale for the exception "'is that the excitement of the event limits the declarant's capacity to fabricate a statement and thereby offers some guarantee of its reliability.'" United States v. Jones, 299 F.3d 103, 112 (2d Cir. 2002).
Thus while the hearsay exception for present sense impressions focuses on contemporaneity as the guarantor of reliability, and requires that the hearsay statement "describe or explain" the contemporaneous event or condition, the excited utterance exception is based on the psychological impact of the event itself, and permits admission of a broader range of hearsay statements-i.e., those that "relate to" the event.
Id. at 112 n.3 (internal citations omitted). A ruling regarding admissibility under the present sense impression or excited utterance exception must await trial.

III. Request Number 7 - Evidence Regarding Failure to File Written Application [*28]  for Accommodation
Plaintiff requests that the Court exclude any evidence that Hampson failed to file the appropriate written request for an accommodation, in accordance with State Farm's established system. Citing the Court's summary judgment decision, Plaintiff asserts that an employee need not use any particular words to make an accommodation request.6 (Dkt. No. 40, p. 24). Plaintiff therefore argues: "Since as a matter of law, Hampson was not required under either the [ADA] or the NYSHRL to file a specific written application created by State Farm to receive a reasonable accommodation for her disability, this defense is irrelevant, immaterial and unduly prejudicial without any probative value." (Dkt. No. 69, p. 9). At the pretrial conference on October 17, 2015, Plaintiff's counsel explained that he sought to exclude evidence of State Farm's process for accommodating people with disabilities and evidence that State Farm asked Plaintiff to submit an application to initiate that process. Defendant argues that "Plaintiff's failure to pursue State Farm's established ADA Accommodation Request procedure is directly relevant to the reasonable accommodation issues." (Dkt. No. 92, p. 22). [*29]  The Court agrees.
Although Plaintiff may not be required to file any particular documents, or use any specific words, in order to request an accommodation under the ADA or the NYSHRL, see Brady, 531 F.3d at 135, the evidence that she did not file a written application under State Farm's established accommodation request process is relevant to the jury's determination regarding whether she is responsible for the purported breakdown of the interactive process. As the Court found in denying Defendant's summary judgment motion, there is an issue of fact regarding whether State Farm or Plaintiff was responsible for the breakdown in that interactive process. See Dkt. No. 40, pp., 24-26. It will be up to the jury to decide, after hearing all of the evidence, whether Plaintiff failed to sufficiently request an accommodation, or to engage in the interactive process. Thus, the Court concludes that the probative value of the evidence that Plaintiff failed to submit a written request for accommodation outweighs any danger of unfair prejudice.

IV. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court will rule on the admissibility of the emails Plaintiff seeks to admit after Plaintiff presents foundational evidence [*30]  at trial; and it is hereby:
ORDERED that Defendant's request to exclude the testimony of Lori Ercolini and Rene Streicher is DENIED; and it is further
ORDERED that Plaintiff's request to exclude evidence of her application for receipt of SSDI benefits, is DENIED; and it is further
ORDERED that Plaintiff's request to exclude evidence regarding the SSA's determination of disability and her receipt of SSDI benefits is GRANTED at this time; the Court will rule at trial on any request to admit SSDI benefits based upon the Plaintiff's introduction of her financial status as an issue; and it is further
ORDERED that Plaintiff's request to exclude evidence that she did not file a written request for accommodation in State Farm's formal accommodation request system is DENIED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
