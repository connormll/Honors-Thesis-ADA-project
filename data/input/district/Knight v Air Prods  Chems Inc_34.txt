Opinion


Order GRANTING Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 20)
This case arises out of Defendant Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.'s (APCI) firing of and alleged discrimination against Plaintiff Marshall Knight after he injured his knee. APCI moves for summary judgment on Knight's claims. Dkt. 20 (Mot.). Knight opposes. Dkt. 25 (Opp'n). The Court deems this matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. For the reasons stated below, the motion is GRANTED.

I. FACTS

A. Parties and Background
APCI provides industrial gases, related equipment, and applications expertise to customers in refining, chemical, metal, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage industries. DUF ¶ 1.1 At its Santa Fe Springs and proximate facilities, APCI [*2]  employed drivers, specialized drivers, maintenance technicians (for plant and vehicle), managers, and one administrative employee. Id. ¶ 3.2
APCI hired Knight as a truck driver at its Santa Fe Springs facility on May 31, 2016. Id. ¶ 2. Knight has worked as a driver since 2002. Id. ¶ 7. Before 2002, Knight had 9 years of experience as a supervisor. Id.
Drivers at APCI generally loaded and unloaded their own trucks and made the necessary preparations for their assigned drive. Id. ¶ 4. One of the essential job functions for truck drivers was also to occasionally lift "20-50lbs/9-22.5kg of force occasionally* and/or 10-15lbs/4.5-7kg of force frequently." Id. ¶ 5; dkt. 20-22 at 6. Maintenance technicians were responsible for loading liquid into large, approximately 350-liter, drums and moving the drums throughout the facility. DUF ¶ 6.

B. Injury and Initial Medical Care
Knight claims he injured his knee on May 25, 2017. Id. ¶ 15. He told his supervisor, Jeremy Esses, about it the same day, and said he did not need medical service, but just wanted to go home and sleep. Id. ¶¶ 16, 17. Knight did not work his shift scheduled for later that day. Id. ¶ 18.
Knight first sought professional treatment [*3]  for his knee on June 5, 2017. Id. ¶ 20. The doctor diagnosed Knight with a "sprain of unspecified site of right knee" and gave him work restrictions of limited standing and walking; no motor vehicle driving at work; no kneeling, squatting, climbing or ladders; and no pushing, pulling, or lifting more than 15 pounds. Id. ¶¶ 20-21. The restrictions remained in place through July 24, 2017. Id. ¶ 22. Knight filed a worker's compensation claim, which was later denied and then settled after Knight appealed. Id. ¶ 23.

C. APCI Creates a Light Duty Position and Then Puts Knight on Leave
From June 5, 2017 through July 25, 2017, APCI created a light duty position at the Santa Fe Springs facility for Knight to avoid a "lost time injury" and allow Knight time to heal. Id. ¶ 26.
On July 25, 2017, Knight received the result of his MRI with doctor's notes stating Knight's MRI showed "mild effusion," but was otherwise "negative." Id. ¶ 28. Knight informed APCI of the results of his MRI the same day. Id. On July 25, 2017, Knight's work restrictions were modified to: no climbing ladders and no repetitive kneeling or squatting. Id. ¶ 29. Knight was later placed on total temporary disability by Dr. Wu from [*4]  August 17, 2017 through at least December 9, 2017. Id.
On July 26, 2017, APCI discontinued Knight's light duty position and put him on unpaid leave, which continued through Knight's termination. Id. ¶ 32. Knight's reasonable accommodations were determined by Erick Hawkins, the site manager, and Phillip Quintana, who worked in human resources. PUF ¶ 20.
Knight disagreed with the July 25, 2017 medical diagnoses and modification of work restrictions and sought a second opinion, asserting he was still in pain and having trouble walking. DUF ¶ 31. Knight testified he could not drive a truck as part of his job at APCI from June 5, 2017 through August 2, 2018 as a result of his knee injury. Id. ¶ 34.

D. APCI and Knight Communicate about Workers' Compensation, a Disability Certificate, and Fitness of Duty Forms
On October 18, 2017, APCI sent Knight a letter, describing his responsibilities while on Workers' Compensation leave and stating, "If you have not returned to work within 12 months from the start of your Workers' Compensation leave, your employment status will be terminated." Id. ¶ 35. APCI's Medical Leave of Absence Policy allows employees to take up to 24 months of leave. Id. APCI placed [*5]  Knight on "personal leave for medical reasons" instead of normal medical leave. Id. APCI does not have any policies or procedures for personal leave for medical reasons, including guidance on the maximum amount of potential leave. Id. APCI claims Knight was not placed on medical leave because it did not have the necessary documentation from Knight. PUF ¶ 3.
On February 7, 2018, Knight sent Esses a disability certificate from Western Orthopedic Surgical Associates, which included the following work restrictions: no squatting, kneeling, or climbing; and no lifting greater than 30 pounds. DUF ¶ 37. On February 9, 2018, Hawkins emailed Knight Fitness for Duty forms, detailing the essential duties of Knight's position as a driver, and requesting that Knight ask his medical provider to complete the forms and opine on his fitness for duty given those essential job functions. Id. ¶ 38.
On February 28, 2018, Knight received a disability certificate from Dr. Dorsey at Western Orthopedic Surgical Associates, stating Knight was placed on temporary total disability until March 28, 2018; Knight sent the document to Hawkins. Id. ¶¶ 40, 43. On March 1, 2018, Hawkins emailed Knight to determine whether [*6]  Knight had received the completed Fitness for Duty forms from his doctor. Id. ¶ 41. Hawkins stated, "Jeremy and I have not heard from you since I responded to your original email on February 9." Id. On March 1, 2018, Knight emailed Hawkins, stating, "I have not yet received the forms back from my doctor. Once I receive the forms, I will definitely forward them to you." Id. ¶ 42. On March 21, 2018, Hawkins followed up asking if a doctor reviewed the forms with Knight. Id. ¶ 43. Hawkins also left phone messages asking for an update. Id. ¶ 44. Knight never sent APCI the completed forms. Id. ¶ 38.

E. Knight's Continued Medical Treatment
On March 27, 2018, Knight received a physician's report stating he could perform "desk work only." Id. ¶ 45. Knight received the same reports from his physician on May 15, 2018 and August 14, 2018. Id.
On July 30, 2018, as part of the Workers' Compensation process, Dr. Patrick O'Meara opined that Knight was able to return to work, should never have been on modified duty, and should never have been placed on total temporary disability. Id. ¶ 46. Knight testified he disagreed with Dr. O'Meara's report, and he could not have worked as a driver from June 5, 2018 [*7]  through August 2, 2018 due to his knee injury. Id. ¶ 47. APCI is not a listed recipient on the report. Id. Knight did not send Dr. O'Meara's report to APCI. Id. ¶ 48. Knight testified he never informed APCI when or if he would be able to perform the essential functions of a driver. Id. ¶ 50.

F. Knight's Termination
Hawkins, with counsel from human resources, made the decision to terminate Knight because, "[a]t that point of termination I believe it had been over 12 months since Marshall had been out with minimal communication and no end point in sight. We needed to move on and fill his position." PUF ¶ 25. The last medical note Hawkins reviewed was the February 7, 2018 work restrictions. Id. ¶ 27. On August 1, 2018, APCI sent Knight a letter outlining the reasons it was terminating his employment:
To date, your worker's compensation claim has not been approved, nor has a salary continuation claim been approved. You have been absent from work for more than 12 months, which is the maximum period of unpaid leave available to you, and you have given us no indication of when, or if, you will be able to perform the essential functions of your truck driver position on behalf of the company. [*8]  As a result, your employment status with Air Products has been terminated as of August 2, 2018.
DUF ¶ 49.
Knight was placed on total temporary disability by Dr. Dorsey from September 11, 2018 through October 31, 2018 and December 7, 2018 through March 10, 2019. Id. ¶ 51. Knight testified he agreed with Dr. Dorsey's assessment. Id. Knight did not start searching for a new job until April 2019, after he was medically cleared by Dr. Dorsey. Id. ¶ 52.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
"A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense — or the part of each claim or defense — on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "This burden is not a light one." In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010). But the moving party need not disprove the opposing party's case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Rather, "the burden on the moving party may be discharged by 'showing' - that is, pointing out to the district court — that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Id. at 325.
If the moving party satisfies its burden, the party opposing the motion must set forth specific facts, through [*9]  affidavits or admissible discovery materials, showing there exists a genuine issue for trial. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323-24; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). A non-moving party who bears the burden of proof at trial as to an element essential to its case must make a showing sufficient to establish a genuine dispute of fact with respect to the existence of that element of the case or be subject to summary judgment. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322.
The "mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue of fact is a genuine issue if it reasonably can be resolved in favor of either party. Id. at 248. "[A] district court is not entitled to weigh the evidence and resolve disputed underlying factual issues." Chevron Corp. v. Pennzoil Co., 974 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1992). Summary judgment is improper "where divergent ultimate inferences may reasonably be drawn from the undisputed facts." Fresno Motors, LLC v. Mercedes Benz USA, LLC, 771 F.3d 1119, 1125 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Miller v. Glenn Miller Prods., Inc., 454 F.3d 975, 988 (9th Cir. 2006)). Instead, "the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587-88, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (punctuation omitted).

III. DISCUSSION
Knight brings claims for disability discrimination, Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(a); failure to accommodate, Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(m); failure to engage in an [*10]  interactive process, Cal. Gov't. Code §12940(n); retaliation under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Cal. Gov't. Code §12940(h); failure to prevent harassment and discrimination, Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(k); retaliation under the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), Cal. Gov't. Code §12945.2(l)(1); and wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Dkt. 1. APCI moves for summary judgment on all Knight's claims. Mot. at 1-4.

A. Evidentiary Issues

1. Knight's Evidentiary Objections
Knight submits 27 pages of evidentiary objections. Dkt. 27 (Knight Objs.). The objections are "boilerplate recitations of evidentiary principles or blanket objections without analysis applied to specific items of evidence." Doe v. Starbucks, Inc., No. SACV 08-0582 AG CWX, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118878, 2009 WL 5183773, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 18, 2009). The Court's Order re Motions for Summary Judgment warns that "boilerplate objections . . . will be overruled and disregarded." The Court will not scrutinize each objection and give a full analysis of identical objections raised as to each fact. Doe, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118878, 2009 WL 5183773, at *1 (addressing "only objections to evidence that is central to the issues discussed in this Order"); see also Capitol Recs., LLC v. BlueBeat, Inc., 765 F. Supp. 2d 1198, 1200 n.1 (C.D. Cal. 2010) ("In motions for summary judgment with numerous objections, it is often unnecessary and impractical for a court to methodically scrutinize each objection and give a full analysis of each argument raised." (quoting Doe, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118878, 2009 WL 5183773, at *1)).
Nevertheless, the Court briefly considers Knight's objections. Knight objects to many statements [*11]  in and exhibits attached to Max Monestime's and Jeffery Sturgeon's declarations as lacking foundation; lacking personal knowledge; hearsay; conclusory, speculative, and argumentative; barred by the best evidence rule; improper expert testimony, and irrelevant. See generally Knight Objs. Many of these objections do not make any sense. For example, Knight objects to a statement about what he testified to at his own deposition as conclusory, speculative and argumentative, as well as on a host of other grounds. Id. at 13. The Court fails to see how merely reciting what Knight stated in his own deposition is speculative.
Knight's objections to many statements as lacking foundation, lacking personal knowledge, hearsay, conclusory, barred by the best evidence rule, and improper expert testimony are similarly perplexing. These statements are all accompanied by underlying, supporting documents. Knight does not dispute the authenticity of the documents. This, in conjunction with the characteristics of the documents, supports that they are authentic. See Las Vegas Sands, LLC v. Nehme, 632 F.3d 526, 533-34 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding a letter and return receipt could be authenticated by their distinctive characteristics, such as the date, address, date-stamp, and [*12]  letterhead); Wineland v. Air & Liquid Sys. Corp., No. C19-0793RSL, 523 F. Supp. 3d 1245, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41311, 2021 WL 843166, at *1 n.2 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 4, 2021) (holding documents were authentic because the objecting party did not identify anything that raised a question about their authenticity, and someone with knowledge of the documents relied on them). The Court has viewed the documents and finds their appearance, content, and characteristics establish their authenticity, and has relied on the underlying documents and not a party's characterization of those documents.
Additionally, "objections to evidence on the ground that it is irrelevant . . . [is] duplicative of the summary judgment standard itself" and thus "redundant" and unnecessary to consider here. Burch v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1119 (E.D. Cal. 2006); see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248 ("Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.").
Knight also objects to certain of APCI's asserted facts as misstating the underlying testimony. See, e.g., Knight Objs. at 3, 4. The Court has examined the underlying testimony and has not relied on a party's characterization of the testimony, or any legal conclusions asserted by any party. The Court has considered only admissible evidence. Knight's objections are OVERRULED.

2. APCI's Evidentiary Objections
First, APCI objects to Knight's statement in his declaration that he and Hawkins [*13]  communicated by phone in July "on the grounds that this declaration includes telephone records that were not identified or produced in Plaintiff's Initial Disclosures. Plaintiff also did not produce the records in response to Defendant's Requests for Production to which they are responsive, including a request for all documents that relate to Plaintiff's communication with any employee of Defendant." Dkt. 28-7 (APCI Objs.) at 3. The Court has not relied on the phone records and they are irrelevant to the grounds on which the Court decided this motion. The objection is therefore OVERRULED as moot.
Second, APCI objects to Knight's deposition testimony that his doctor would provide copies of a report to APCI as hearsay. But "[a]t the summary judgment stage, [the Court does] not focus on the admissibility of the evidence's form. [The Court] instead focus[es] on the admissibility of its contents." Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 2003). Regarding the testimony in question, the doctor could take the stand and convey that he provided copies of a report to APCI. Id. at 1037 (citing Hughes v. United States, 953 F.2d 531, 543 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that an affidavit could be considered on summary judgment despite hearsay and best evidence rule objections because the facts underlying the affidavit [*14]  were of the type that would be admissible evidence, even though the affidavit itself might not be admissible); J.F. Feeser, Inc. v. Serv-A-Portion, Inc., 909 F.2d 1524, 1542 (3d Cir. 1990) (ruling that hearsay evidence produced in an affidavit may be considered if the out-of-court declarant could later present the evidence through direct testimony)). This objection is OVERRULED.
Third, APCI objects to statements and supporting evidence as irrelevant. See APCI Objs. at 2, 3. These objections are OVERRULED for the reasons stated above.

B. Disability Discrimination Claim
Section 12940(a) of FEHA prohibits an employer from discharging an employee because of that employee's physical disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). In analyzing disability discrimination claims under FEHA, California courts apply the three-stage burden-shifting approach established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under the McDonnell Douglas test, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case, which raises a presumption of discrimination. Lawler v. Montblanc N. Am., LLC, 704 F.3d 1235, 1242 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000)). The burden then shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption by producing admissible evidence sufficient to show that "the adverse employment action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason." Id. If the employer meets its burden, the presumption established in the first step disappears, [*15]  and the plaintiff must raise a triable issue suggesting that the employer's proffered reason is mere pretext for unlawful discrimination or offer other evidence of discriminatory motive. Id.
When an employer moves for summary judgment, however, "the burden is reversed . . . because the defendant who seeks summary judgment bears the initial burden." Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Dep't of Fair Emp. & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011)). "Thus, to prevail on summary judgment, the employer is required to show either that (1) plaintiff could not establish one of the elements of the FEHA claim or (2) there was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment." Id. (brackets omitted). "If the employer meets its burden, the discharged employee must demonstrate either 'that the defendant's showing was in fact insufficient or . . . that there was a triable issue of fact material to the defendant's showing." Id. (alteration in original).
APCI argues Knight cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination because Knight cannot establish he was performing competently as he was unable to perform the essential duties of a truck driver, or that he was terminated because of his injury. Mot. at 9. "To [*16]  show a prima facie case of disability discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was performing competently in the position she held; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination; and (4) some other circumstances that suggest a discriminatory motive." Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1242 (citing Zeinali v. Raytheon Co., 636 F.3d 544, 552 (9th Cir. 2011)).
"California state courts analyze whether an employee is competently performing a position by determining whether she can perform the 'essential duties' of her position with or without reasonable accommodation." Id. (quoting Green v. State of California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007)). An employer may lawfully discharge an employee who "is unable to perform his or her essential duties . . . even with reasonable accommodations." Id. at 1242 (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(1)). This is because section 12940
makes it clear that drawing distinctions on the basis of physical or mental disability is not forbidden discrimination in itself. Rather, drawing these distinctions is prohibited only if the adverse employment action occurs because of a disability and the disability would not prevent the employee from performing the essential duties of the job, at least not with reasonable accommodation.
Id. (quoting Green, 42 Cal. 4th at 262). "FEHA defines 'essential functions' as the 'fundamental [*17]  job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires.'" Atkins v. City of Los Angeles, 8 Cal. App. 5th 696, 716, 214 Cal. Rptr. 3d 113 (2017) (quoting Cal. Gov't. Code § 12926(f)).
APCI has met its burden of demonstrating Knight cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination because he could not competently perform the essential duties of the position. Knight could not drive, which is the essential job responsibility of a truck driver.
Knight's medical records and testimony cumulatively support that Knight could not drive. The first doctor Knight saw gave him restrictions of no driving at work, which remained in place until July 24, 2017. DUF ¶¶ 20-22. Though the results of Knight's July 25, 2017 MRI were negative, id. ¶ 28, and the surgeon stated he could not find anything "seriously wrong" with Knight's knee, dkt. 21-10 at 6, Knight disagreed with the medical diagnoses and modification of work restrictions, DUF ¶ 31. He sought a second opinion, asserting he was still in pain and having trouble walking. Id. Knight testified he could not drive a truck as part of his job for APCI from June 5, 2017 through August 2, 2018 as a result of his knee injury. Id. ¶ 34.
Knight was placed on total temporary disability by Dr. Wu from August 17, 2017 through at least [*18]  December 9, 2017. Id. ¶ 29. Knight received a report on February 28, 2018 again placing him on total disability, id. ¶¶ 40, 43, and received a report on March 27, 2018 stating he could perform only desk work, id. ¶ 45. And again, although Knight received a report on July 30, 2018 stating he could return to work and should never have been placed on disability, id. ¶ 46, API did not receive that report, id., and Knight testified he disagreed with the report and could not drive, id. ¶ 37. Knight was placed on total temporary disability again by Dr. Dorsey from September 11, 2018 through October 31, 2018, and December 7, 2018 through March 10, 2019. Id. ¶ 51. Knight testified he agreed with Dr. Dorsey's assessment. Id. Knight did not start searching for a new job until April 2019, after he was medically cleared by Dr. Dorsey. Id. ¶ 52.
Further, Knight received job restrictions, such as the one Knight sent to APCI on February 7, 2018, which prevented Knight from lifting more than 30 pounds. Id. ¶ 37. One of the essential job functions for truck drivers was to occasionally lift "20-50lbs/9-22.5kg of force occasionally* and/or 10-15lbs/4.5-7kg of force frequently." Id. ¶ 5; dkt. 20-22 at 6. [*19]  Drivers at APCI generally loaded and unloaded their own trucks and made the necessary preparations for their assigned drive. DUF ¶ 4. Knight could not lift the required amount, and therefore could not perform an essential function of the job.
There is no dispute of material fact that Knight could not complete the essential duty of his job — driving — with or without accommodation. Knight has not identified any accommodation, and the Court cannot think of one, that would allow a driver who cannot drive to perform his job. See Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1243 ("Lawler, however, offers no factual support showing she can perform any job duty of a boutique manager, regardless of the accommodation. Rather, she admitted that her disability makes it impossible for her to fulfill the duties of her position and that she has been unemployed since October 2009, has not applied for any positions, has made no effort to secure employment, and has exhausted her disability benefits."); Atkins, 8 Cal. App. 5th at 720 (dismissing a FEHA claim because injured police officers could not participate in physical training, which was an essential function of a police recruit, even with reasonable accommodation); Hurd v. Am. Income Life Ins., No. 2:13-CV-5205-RSWL, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163742, 2014 WL 6629996, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2014) (holding a marketing specialist who had to drive to different [*20]  locations could not perform the essential duties of her job without accommodation because she could not drive and her requested accommodation, working from home or extending disability leave, meant she could not perform her essential job functions of "physical presence and constant personal networking"); Latham v. Cambria Co. LLC, No. SA CV 16-0561-DOC (PLAx), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4976, *14 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 12, 2017) (dismissing a FEHA claim despite the plaintiff's belief he could perform the essential duties of his job because "it is undisputed that Plaintiff was on temporary total disability and remained in that status for about nine months after his termination").
Knight summarily argues he makes a prima facie case of discrimination because he has shown "that he was (1) a member of protected class, here, Mr. Knight suffered from a disability — a knee injury that limited his ability to work; (2) qualified for his job, as is shown by his exemplary work history; and (3) [was] fired (Plaintiff was also suspended on the basis of his disability)." Opp'n at 7 (citing Mixon v. Fair Emp. & Hous. Com., 192 Cal. App. 3d 1306, 1318, 237 Cal. Rptr. 884 (1987)). But Knight does not address his inability to perform the essential features of his job, which is fatal to his claim. He spends most of his discussion on whether APCI had a legitimate reason to fire him and the alleged pretext for the [*21]  firing. Opp'n at 7-10. But APCI's responsibility to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory rationale for the firing comes only after a plaintiff has established a prima facie case. Knight has not done that here, and APCI has met its burden to demonstrate Knight cannot establish a prima facie case.
Summary judgment is GRANTED to APCI on Knight's first claim for disability discrimination.

C. Reasonable Accommodation and Interactive Process Claims
APCI argues it is entitled to summary judgment on Knight's second and third claims for relief because he cannot establish APCI failed to reasonably accommodate him or failed to engage in the interactive process. Mot. at 13.

1. Reasonable Accommodation
It violates FEHA for an employer "to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability" of an employee, or "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any." Cal. Gov't. Code §§ 12940(m), 12926(n). To prevail on summary judgment, an employer must establish that: "(1) reasonable accommodation was offered and refused; (2) there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled [*22]  employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation; or (3) the employer did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 262-63, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). The reasonable accommodation requirement "entail[s] affirmative action" by the employer, but it "does not require creating a new job, moving another employee, promoting the disabled employee, or violating another employee's rights." Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1389, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000) (quotation marks omitted).
Knight's claim fails because there was no vacant positions Knight could have performed, with or without accommodation. Knight "foreclosed any argument that [APCI] could have accommodated him" in his driver position because he could not perform the essential functions of a truck driver, as noted above. Chisolm v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 814 F. App'x 194, 196 (9th Cir. 2020). His "claim thus depends on the availability of reassignment positions." Id. "An employer can prevail on summary judgment on a claim of failure to reasonably accommodate by establishing through undisputed facts that there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was [*23]  qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation." Id. (brackets omitted) (citing Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 378, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015) and Spitzer, 80 Cal. App. 4th at 1389 ("[A]n employer is relieved of the duty to reassign a disabled employee . . . if there is no vacant position for which the employee is qualified.")).
APCI established Knight was not qualified for any other position at the Santa Fe Springs facility, and Knight has not offered any evidence to the contrary. At its Santa Fe Springs and proximate facilities, APCI employed drivers, specialized drivers, maintenance technicians (for plant and vehicle), managers, and one administrative employee. DUF ¶ 3. As discussed above, Knight could not drive, so he could not have worked as a driver or specialized driver. Further, maintenance technicians were responsible for loading liquid into large, approximately 350-liter drums and moving the drums around the facility. Id. ¶ 6; dkt. 21-4 at 19:10-17 ("These containers would be very large. . . . They would move these containers throughout the facility. So a rather large facility with a loading dock. They would load trailers and unload trailers."). As also discussed above, Knight's work restrictions prohibited him from [*24]  lifting heavy amounts or squatting.
Knight was also not qualified for a managerial or administrative position. Though Knight had worked as a supervisor in the past, he has worked only as a driver since 2002. DUF ¶ 7. APCI's duty to accommodate did not extend to promoting Knight into a position as a manager or in administrative work. Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1223, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899 (2006) ("The responsibility to reassign a disabled employee who cannot otherwise be accommodated does 'not require creating a new job, moving another employee, promoting the disabled employee or violating another employee's rights.'"). There is no evidence Knight was able to perform the essential functions of a position in management or administrative work when he had solely been driving trucks for 15 years. Knight's failure to accommodate claim therefore fails. See Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746 ("As previously discussed, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to Carauddo's inability to perform the essential functions of the installer position, and Lucent's inability to reasonably accommodate him. This same evidence establishes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Carauddo's termination").
APCI's creation of a temporary light duty position for Knight also does not demonstrate [*25]  it could have accommodated Knight. "FEHA does not require an employer to exempt a disabled employee from any essential function of the job or convert a temporary, light-duty accommodation into a permanent position." Urbina v. Comcast Cable Commc'ns Mgmt., LLC, 788 F. App'x 522 (9th Cir. 2019) (citing Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 374-76 and Raine, 135 Cal. App. 4th at 1223-24). APCI's duty to accommodate did not require it to create a new job for Knight. Raine, 135 Cal. App. 4th at 1223 (quoting Spitzer, 80 Cal. App. 4th at 1389) (citing McCullah v. S. Cal. Gas Co., 82 Cal. App. 4th 495, 501, 98 Cal. Rptr. 2d 208 (2000) ("The employer is not required to create new positions or 'bump' other employees to accommodate the disabled employee.").
APCI was also not obligated to keep Knight on leave indefinitely. Markowitz v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 711 F. App'x 430, 431 (9th Cir. 2018) ("Employers are not required to provide indefinite leaves of absence." (citing 2 Cal. Code Regs. 11068(c) and Dark v. Curry City, 451 F.3d 1078, 1090 (9th Cir. 2006))).
Knight argues — without support — that APCI has not provided any evidence that it did not have an available vacant position. Opp'n at 11. As noted above, that is not true. APCI provided both documentary and testimonial evidence to outline the different types of jobs at the Santa Fe Springs facility and their essential duties, none of which Knight qualified for. Knight has not identified any accommodation that would have enabled him to perform any of those jobs.
Summary judgment is GRANTED to APCI on Knight's failure to accommodate claim.

2. Failure to Engage in an Interactive Process
"Under [*26]  FEHA, an employer must engage in a good faith interactive process with the disabled employee to explore the alternatives to accommodate the disability." Wysinger v. Auto. Club of S. Cal., 157 Cal. App. 4th 413, 424, 69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2007) (citing Cal. Gov't. Code §12940(n)). "To prevail on a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process, the employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process occurred." Id. (citing Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1018, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) and Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 974, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008)).
"An employee cannot necessarily be expected to identify and request all possible accommodations during the interactive process itself because [e]mployees do not have at their disposal the extensive information concerning possible alternative positions or possible accommodations which employers have." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018 (citations and quotations omitted). But "the employee should be able to identify specific, available reasonable accommodations through the litigation process, and particularly by the time the parties have conducted discovery and reached the summary judgment stage." Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 379 (citing Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1019)).
As discussed above, Knight has not identified any existing positions that he qualified for or any accommodations to allow him to work at the Santa Fe Springs facility in any capacity. Because Knight has not identified a reasonable [*27]  accommodation, there is no genuine issue of fact concerning his claim for failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of § 12940(n). See Pratt v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., No. 2:14-CV-00815-CAS, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60101, 2015 WL 2153397 (C.D. Cal. May 4, 2015) (dismissing failure to engage in the interactive process claims because "although the record demonstrates that significant discovery has occurred in this case, plaintiff has not identified any other 'specific, available reasonable accommodation,' such as an alternate position with Delta that did not require regular, work site attendance"); Markowitz, 711 F. App'x at 431 (dismissing failure to engage in the interactive process claims where "UPS had no obligation to take further steps to come up with reasonable accommodations until Markowitz gave some indication that she would be able to return to work in any capacity").

D. Retaliation
APCI argues Knight's fourth and sixth claims for retaliation under FEHA and the CFRA fail because it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason to fire Knight. Mot. at 20.
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." [*28]  Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1243 (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h)). "California courts also employ the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework in analyzing retaliation claims." Id. (citing Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1030, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123, (2005)). A plaintiff claiming retaliation under FEHA must establish a prima facie case by showing that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) the defendant subjected her to an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the two. See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1020.
Once the prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to the defendant to show a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. Id. at 1020. In evaluating a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, "the ultimate issue is simply whether the employer acted with a motive to discriminate illegally. Thus, 'legitimate' reasons in this context are reasons that are facially unrelated to prohibited bias, and which, if true, would thus preclude a finding of discrimination." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 358 (citation omitted).
Once such a showing is made, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to establish intentional retaliation. Id. at 1021, see also Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Int'l, 151 Cal. App. 4th 1102, 1109, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007) ("If the employer produces evidence showing a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, 'the presumption of retaliation' drops out of the picture, and the burden shifts back to the [*29]  employee to provide 'substantial responsive evidence' that the employer's proffered reasons were untrue or pretextual.") (citations omitted).
Similarly, to succeed on his retaliation claim under the CFRA, Knight must establish: (1) APCI was an employer covered by the CFRA; (2) Knight was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave; (3) Knight exercised his right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) Knight suffered an adverse employment action because he exercised his right to leave under the CFRA. See Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 885, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007) (citing Dudley v. Dep't. of Transp., 90 Cal. App. 4th 255, 261, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 739 (2001)). Once an employee establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. If the employer produces a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason, the presumption of retaliation "drops out of the picture," and the burden shifts back to the employee to prove intentional retaliation. Id. (quotations omitted).
Neither party addresses the prima facie case under either statute, so the Court assumes there is a prima facie case under both the FMLA and CRLA. The Court therefore addresses whether APCI had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for firing Knight. It did. Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1243-44, is controlling. In [*30]  Lawler, the Ninth Circuit held an employer proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for firing an employee because the employee could not perform the essential functions of the position. Id. (citing Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746 (recognizing an employer's inability-to-perform defense as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating a cable installer's employment) and Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 7293.8(b)). The same is true here. APCI has produced evidence Knight could not perform the essential functions of a truck driver and was not qualified for any other position. It has therefore offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for firing Knight.
Under both FEHA and the CFRA, the burden then shifts back to Knight to establish intentional retaliation or that APCI's proffered reason for termination was pretextual. Knight has not met that burden. "A plaintiff must offer 'specific' and 'substantial' circumstantial evidence to prove pretext in a retaliation claim under FEHA." Id. at 1244-45 (quoting Winarto v. Toshiba Am. Elecs. Components, Inc., 274 F.3d 1276, 1284 (9th Cir. 2001)). Knight does not address the burden shifting analysis with regards to the retaliation claim, but argues he "was met with retaliation at several stages of his employment under the supervision of Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Esses" because (1) he was disciplined [*31]  for requesting time off following his injury, and (2) "APCI made unreasonable demands of Mr. Knight despite his compliance with their requests for additional medical information." Opp'n at 12.
Knight has not produced evidence to support these claims and meet his burden. First, the records Knight produced, dkt. 25-7, Ex. 2 (Leave Records), demonstrated Knight was suspended for two days without pay "as disciplinary action for your continued failure to report to work or report to work on time, and your repeated failure to properly notify me, as your manager, in advance of your absences and tardiness from work, as required of you in your job." Id. at APCI 000177. But of the 15 sick or personal days off Knight took, 13 of those were before Knight's knee injury on May 25, 2015. Id. at APCI 000174; DUF ¶ 15. Eleven of the absences were on days that would extend Knight's weekend. Leave Records at APCI 000174. He took only 2 of those 15 days off for his knee injury. Id. These records are insufficient to demonstrate Knight was disciplined for requesting time off for his injury.
Second, Knight does not support his argument that APCI made unreasonable demands of him "despite his compliance with [*32]  their requests for additional medical information." Opp'n at 12. There is no evidence APCI made unreasonable requests of Knight, and Knight does not identify what those requests were. To the extent Knight is arguing it was unreasonable for APCI to request Knight complete the Fitness of Duty forms, the Court finds this is insufficient to meet Knight's burden and avoid summary judgment. Although Knight sent Esses a disability certificate with work restrictions, DUF ¶ 37, the Fitness for Duty forms were more specific, detailing the essential duties of Knight's position as a driver and requesting that Knight ask his medical provider to opine on his fitness for duty given those essential duties, id. ¶ 38. Knight never sent APCI the completed form. Id. Eventually terminating Knight for failure to supply information after the initially designated 12-months of leave in this context does not constitute a "substantial" offering sufficient to overcome APCI's proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating his employment. See Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1244-45.
Knight also makes references elsewhere in his Opposition to biased remarks made by Hawkins, such as that he did not believe Knight suffered an injury. See [*33]  Opp'n at 9-10. But Knight does not cite evidence to support anyone made any biased remarks. The assertion, without supporting evidence, is insufficient.
Summary judgment is GRANTED to APCI on Knight's fourth and sixth claims for retaliation under FEHA and the CFRA.

E. Failure to Prevent Harassment and Discrimination
APCI argues it is entitled to summary judgment on Knight's fifth claim for failure to prevent harassment and discrimination because he cannot establish the underlying, predicate claims. Mot. at 22. California Government Code section 12940(k) provides that "[i]t is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer . . . to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring."
Knight's failure to prevent claim fails because Knight's underlying discrimination claim fails. Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 748 ("Nevertheless, employers are not liable for failing to take necessary steps to prevent discrimination, 'except where the [discriminatory] actions took place and were not prevented.'" (quoting Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998) and citing Carter v. Cal. Dep't of Veterans Affs., 38 Cal. 4th 914, 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 223, 135 P.3d 637 (2006)); Alejandro v. ST Micro Elecs., Inc, 178 F. Supp. 3d 850, 864 (N.D. Cal. 2016) ("An actionable claim under section 12940, subdivision (k) is dependent on a claim of actual discrimination: 'Employers should not be held liable to employees for failure to take necessary steps to prevent such conduct, except [*34]  where the actions took place and were not prevented.'" (quoting Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1021))).
Summary judgment is GRANTED to APCI on Knight's fifth claim for failure to prevent harassment and discrimination.

F. Wrongful Termination Claim
APCI argues Knight's claim for wrongful discharge fails because it replicates his claims for discrimination and retaliation based on disability under CFRA and Knight has produced no evidence to support either allegation. The Court agrees. Markowitz, 711 F. App'x at 431 ("Markowitz's claims for wrongful termination in violation of public policy fail for the same reasons that her underlying claims for disability discrimination and failure to engage in the interactive process under FEHA fail." (citing Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 229-30, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999))).
