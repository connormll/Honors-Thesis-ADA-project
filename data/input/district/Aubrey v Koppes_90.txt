Opinion



ORDER
This matter is before the Court on the Recommendation on Motion to Dismiss (the "Recommendation") (ECF No. 40) to grant in part and deny in part Defendant Weld County Board of County Commissioners' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (ECF No. 21), Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (the "Motion") (ECF No. 23). Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (referred to herein as, "the Complaint") alleges violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701, et seq., and the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act ("CADA"), C.R.S. § 24-34-401, et seq. arising out of her employment and termination with Defendant. (See ECF No. 21.)
Defendant seeks dismissal [*2]  of the Complaint arguing that Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job at the time of her termination. (ECF No. 23 at 4-8.) The Recommendation concluded as follows: (1) Defendant's Motion be denied as to the first cause of action for disability discrimination in violation of the ADA and CADA;1 (2) Defendant's Motion be granted as to the second cause of action for retaliation and that claim be dismissed with prejudice; and (3) Defendant's Motion be granted as to the third cause of action for failure to accommodate and that claim be dismissed without prejudice. (ECF No. 40 at 17.) Both parties object to the Recommendation.
Defendant's objection argues that Plaintiff's first cause of action should be dismissed because it fails to plausibly allege a claim (ECF No. 45) ("Defendant's Objection"). Plaintiff responds that a plausible claim has been alleged. (ECF No. 51.) Plaintiff's objection argues that the Recommendation erred because her retaliation and failure-to-accommodate claims are plausible (ECF No. 46) ("Plaintiff's Objection"). Defendant responds that the Recommendation properly dismissed Plaintiff's second and third causes [*3]  of action. (ECF No. 50.)
For the reasons stated below, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's Objection, SUSTAINS Plaintiff's Objection, AFFIRMS IN PART and REJECTS IN PART the Recommendation, and DENIES the Motion.

I. LEGAL STANDARDS

A. Review of the Magistrate Judge's Recommendation
When a magistrate judge issues a recommendation on a dispositive matter, Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3) requires that the district court judge "determine de novo any part of the magistrate judge's [recommendation] that has been properly objected to." In reviewing, "[t]he district court judge may accept, reject, or modify the recommendation; receive further evidence; or return the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions." Id.
An objection is proper if it is filed timely in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and specific enough to enable the "district judge to focus attention on those issues — factual and legal — that are at the heart of the parties' dispute." United States v. One Parcel of Real Property, 73 F.3d 1057, 1059 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 147, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985)). In the absence of a timely and specific objection, "the district court may review a magistrate's report under any standard it deems appropriate." Summers v. Utah, 927 F.2d 1165, 1167 (10th Cir. 1991) (citations omitted); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 72 Advisory Committee's Note ("When no timely objection is filed, the court [*4]  need only satisfy itself that there is no clear error on the face of the record in order to accept the recommendation.").

B. Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim
The purpose of a motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is to test "the sufficiency of the allegations within the four corners of the complaint after taking those allegations as true." Mobley v. McCormick, 40 F.3d 337, 340 (10th Cir. 1994). "The court's function on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not to weigh potential evidence that the parties might present at trial, but to assess whether the plaintiff's complaint alone is legally sufficient to state a claim for which relief may be granted." Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for the Deaf & Blind, 173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, "[t]he complaint must plead sufficient facts ... to provide 'plausible grounds that discovery will reveal evidence to support the plaintiff's allegations." Shero v. City of Grove, Okl., 510 F.3d 1196, 1200 (10th Cir. 2007) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). Plausibility in this context "must refer to the scope of the allegations in a complaint: if they are so general that they encompass a wide swath of conduct, much of it innocent, then the plaintiffs have not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible." Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1247-48 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The "allegations must be enough that, if assumed to be true, [*5]  the plaintiff plausibly (not just speculatively) has a claim for relief." Id. This requirement of plausibility "serves not only to weed out claims that do not have a reasonable prospect of success, [but also to] provide fair notice to defendants of the actual grounds of the claim against them." Id. at 1248; accord Twombly, 550 U.S. at 582.
"A pleading that offers labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
The parties do not object to the factual or procedural background discussed in the Recommendation. Accordingly, the Court adopts and incorporates the factual and procedural background included within the Recommendation as if set forth herein. For context, the Court provides a brief overview of the allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint, which are taken as true.
Beginning in 2012, Defendant employed Plaintiff in the Weld County Clerk and Recorder's Office. (ECF No. 21, Compl. at ¶ 10.) In December of 2014, Plaintiff was diagnosed with Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome and requested [*6]  leave from her position under the Family Medical Leave Act. (Id. at ¶¶ 15-16.) Plaintiff exhausted her FMLA leave as of February 22, 2015. (Id. at ¶ 18.) On April 15, 2015, Plaintiff received a pre-dismissal notice from Defendant stating that she was not able to perform the essential functions of her job and that Defendant was not able to accommodate her restrictions. (Id. at ¶¶ 21-24.) The pre-dismissal notice advised Plaintiff of a hearing that would take place on April 16, 2015 and that Plaintiff had a right to attend and present any updated information regarding her medical condition. (Id. at ¶ 30.)
Plaintiff provides numerous allegations, in transcript form, regarding what was said at the April 16, 2015 hearing, as it appears to have been recorded. (Id. at ¶¶ 32-36.) Relevant here, Defendant asked Plaintiff whether she could come back to do her full position within a couple of weeks. (Id. at ¶ 35.) Plaintiff responded by telling Defendant, "[i]f you ask me to, I could come back next week. But I would not be able to do the things you asked me to. I mean I could not go to Motor V. I would probably have to be somewhat retrained[.]" (Id.) Then, Plaintiff asked if she could come back [*7]  to a different position as a Tech II. (Id.) Alternatively, Plaintiff asked if Defendant would give her until May 22, 2015 "to get all [her] doctors in order and say [she] can come back." (Id.) Plaintiff was terminated four days after the hearing on April 20, 2015. (Id. at ¶ 43.) This lawsuit followed on June 20, 2017.
On November 2, 2017, Defendant moved to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (See ECF No. 23.) The Court referred the Motion to Magistrate Judge Mark L. Carman on November 13, 2017. (ECF No. 28.) On January 4, 2018, Magistrate Judge Carman issued his Recommendation to grant in part and deny in part the Motion. (ECF No. 40.) On January 18, 2018, Defendant and Plaintiff filed objections to the Recommendation. (ECF Nos. 45 and 46.) On February 1, 2018, the parties responded to each other's objections. (ECF Nos. 50 and 51.) The Court now turns to the objections.

III. ANALYSIS
The Recommendation concluded as follows: (1) Defendant's Motion be denied as to the first cause of action for disability discrimination in violation of the ADA and CADA; (2) Defendant's Motion be granted as to the second cause of action for retaliation and that claim be dismissed [*8]  with prejudice; and (3) Defendant's Motion be granted as to the third cause of action for failure to accommodate and that claim be dismissed without prejudice. (ECF No. 40 at 17.) The Court addresses each of Plaintiff's three causes of action, and the corresponding objections, in order.
A. Disability Discrimination in Violation of ADA (First Cause of Action) The Recommendation concluded that Plaintiff alleged a plausible claim for violation of the ADA. (ECF No. 40 at 14-15; 17.) Defendant's Objection contends that "Plaintiff's own allegations with respect to an ability to perform the essential functions of her job, are conclusory. Merely stating that she could return to work, without providing basic factual support for her allegations, amounts to nothing more than 'threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements.'" (ECF No. 45 at 4.) Plaintiff's response to the objection partially addresses the issue. First, Plaintiff pivots to a theory not raised in response to Defendant Motion: because her FMLA leave was exhausted on February 22, 2015 and she wasn't terminated until April 20, 2015, "a jury could infer that [Plaintiff's] initial leave [*9]  request through August 1, 2015 had been approved and was a reasonable accommodation." (ECF No. 51 at 7.) Second, Plaintiff points to her allegation that she "requested that she be allowed to see her doctor for the scheduled appointment on May 22, 2015 to get an earlier return date." (ECF No. 51 at 8.) The Court agrees with the Recommendation that Plaintiff has alleged a plausible claim for violation of the ADA.
A disability discrimination claim under the ADA requires Plaintiff to prove three things: (1) she was disabled; (2) she was qualified, that is, could perform the essential functions of the job in question, with or without accommodation; and (3) she suffered adverse employment action because of the disability. Matthews v. Denver Post, 263 F.3d 1164, 1167 (10th Cir. 2001). The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff was disabled or that her termination qualifies as an adverse employment action—thus, the dispute centers on whether she was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job in question. Whether she was qualified proceeds along two steps: "First, we must determine whether the individual could perform the essential functions of the job, i.e., functions that bear more than a marginal relationship to the job at issue. Second, [*10]  if (but only if) we conclude that the individual is not able to perform the essential functions of the job, we must determine whether any reasonable accommodation by the employer would enable him [or her] to perform those functions." Id. (citations omitted). The Court will assume, without deciding, that Plaintiff was not able to perform some essential functions of her job.
However, in this case, Plaintiff alleges that she could have returned to work the following week with some retraining or returned to a different position. (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 35); Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1167 (10th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (holding that employers must, when appropriate, accommodate a disabled employee by reassignment to a vacant position if employee cannot be accommodated in existing job). Alternatively, she requested additional time (approximately five weeks) to receive clearance from her doctors. (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 35.) The Court finds that Plaintiff's request for retraining, returning to a different position, or being granted an additional five weeks to receive clearance from her doctors could be, at least at the pleading stage, reasonable accommodations by the employer that would have enabled her to perform the functions of her job. And Hwang v. Kan. State Univ., 753 F.3d 1159 (10th Cir. 2014) does not [*11]  compel a different conclusion.
In Hwang, an assistant professor signed a one-year contract to teach classes over three academic terms. Id. at 1161. After the professor signed the contract, but before she began teaching, she was diagnosed with cancer and the university gave her a six-month paid leave of absence. Id. As the end of her leave drew near, the professor requested additional leave, but the university denied the request based on its inflexible policy of allowing no more than six months' sick leave. Id. The Tenth Circuit upheld dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint because six months of additional leave was unreasonable, as a matter of law, where the professor would have been unable to work, at all, for six additional months. Id. The case before us is different.
Unlike Hwang, Plaintiff's allegations "are all about enabling [her] to work, not to not work." Hwang, 753 F.3d at 1162. Plaintiff requested five additional weeks of leave—one of several requested accommodations—to see her doctors to obtain clearance to work. This is not a situation, like Hwang, where "she couldn't work at any point or in any manner for a period spanning more than six months." Id. at 1161. As the Tenth Circuit recognized in Hwang, "a brief absence [*12]  may sometimes amount to a (legally required) reasonable accommodation so the employee can proceed to discharge her essential job duties."2 Id. at 1162. Plaintiff plausibly alleges a claim for disability discrimination under the ADA. Therefore, Defendant's Objection is overruled.

B. Retaliation in Violation of the ADA (Second Cause of Action)
Next, the Recommendation concluded that Plaintiff's second cause of action be dismissed with prejudice because the Complaint "never plausibly alleges that Plaintiff was terminated because she undertook protected action, a request for accommodation." (ECF No. 40 at 16-17.) The Recommendation reasoned that, because Defendant initiated the process to terminate Plaintiff before the April 16, 2015 hearing where Plaintiff requested the accommodations discussed above, the "alleged request for accommodation did not precipitate the termination; it just failed to avoid the termination." (Id. at 16.) Plaintiff's Objection argues that the Complaint alleges a plausible claim for retaliation because the accommodation requests were made at the April 16, 2015 hearing and Plaintiff was terminated four days later on April 20, 2015. (ECF No. 46 at 6.) Defendant counters that the Recommendation [*13]  correctly concluded that any request for an accommodation "did not precipitate the termination; it just failed to avoid the termination." (ECF No. 50 at 2.)
A retaliation claim under the ADA requires the plaintiff to show: (1) that she engaged in protected activity; (2) that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse; and (3) that a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the materially adverse action. Jones v. U.P.S., Inc., 502 F.3d 1176, 1193 (10th Cir. 2007). Here, Plaintiff alleges that, at the April 16, 2015 hearing, she made the following requests to Ms. Koppes and Ms. Russell: retraining, returning to a different position, or being granted an additional five weeks to see her doctor. (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 35.) Plaintiff's Complaint also alleges that, at some point between February 22, 2015 and the April 16, 2015 hearing, her doctor sent a note to Defendant that Plaintiff anticipated a return to work on August 1, 2015. (Id. at ¶ 19.) Ms. Koppes would ultimately make the decision to terminate Plaintiff after the hearing. (Id. at ¶ 35) Plaintiff was then notified by letter dated April 20, 2015 that her employment was being terminated. (Id. at ¶ 43.) "A retaliatory motive may be inferred [*14]  when an adverse action closely follows protected activity." Anderson v. Coors Brewing Co., 181 F.3d 1171, 1179 (10th Cir. 1999) (citation omitted) (stating that the Tenth Circuit has "[h]eld that a one and one-half month period between protected activity and adverse action may, by itself, establish causation."). Reading Plaintiff's allegations together, she alleges that she requested several accommodations and four days later was terminated by the person to whom she made the request. Plaintiff also alleges that she notified Defendant, at some point between February 22, 2015 and April 15, 2015, that she would need additional leave before she could return to work. Assuming that the request for additional leave was first made on February 22, 2015 and precipitated the termination,3 less than two months elapsed between the protected activity and the adverse action. Anderson, 181 F.3d at 1179. Thus, at least at the current stage of litigation, Plaintiff has alleged what the Court will consider a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA. Although Defendant initiated the termination process prior to Plaintiff's April 16th requests for accommodation, it is an issue to be decided at a later stage as to whether Defendant will proffer a sufficient non-discriminatory, non-retaliatory [*15]  reason (or reasons) for the termination. Therefore, Plaintiff's Objection as to dismissal of the second cause of action is sustained.

C. Failure to Accommodate (Third Cause of Action)
The Recommendation concluded that Plaintiff's third claim for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation is not a separate and distinct claim from the first cause of action brought under the ADA. (ECF No. 40 at 17.) As a result, it was recommended that Plaintiff's third cause of action be dismissed without prejudice as duplicative. (Id.) Plaintiff objects by citing Sanchez v. United States Dep't of Energy, 870 F.3d 1185, 1199 (10th Cir. 2017) for the proposition that a failure-to-accommodate claim is a separate cause of action. Defendant counters that Plaintiff fails to allege a separate claim because failure to accommodate is merely an element of an ADA claim. (ECF No. 50 at 4-5.) The Court agrees with Plaintiff.
The Rehabilitation Act borrows its substantive standards from the ADA. See 29 U.S.C. § 791(g). In Sanchez, the Tenth Circuit addressed whether the plaintiff's complaint had stated a failure-to-accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act. Sanchez, 870 F.3d at 1199. The Circuit stated that failure-to-accommodate claims require allegations that the plaintiff: (1) is disabled; (2) is "otherwise qualified"; and [*16]  (3) requested a plausibly reasonable accommodation. Id. The elements to state a failure-to-accommodate claim are different from the elements for stating a garden-variety violation of the ADA. See Matthews, 263 F.3d at 1167 (stating the elements of an ADA claim as: "(1) was disabled; (2) was qualified, that is, could perform the essential functions of the job in question, with or without accommodation; and (3) suffered adverse employment action because of the disability."); see also Poolaw v. City of Anadarko, Okl., 660 F.2d 459, 465 (10th Cir. 1981) (concluding that plaintiff's "allegation that his post-termination treatment was discriminatory is a claim separate and distinct from his allegation of discriminatory discharge."). Defendant cites no authority to support the argument that failure-to-accommodate cannot be alleged as a separate and distinct claim. Although the elements and facts of the two claims may overlap, the Court finds them to be separate and distinct claims. Therefore, Plaintiff's Objection as to dismissal of the third cause of action is sustained.

IV. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court:
(1) OVERRULES Defendant's Objection to the Recommendation (ECF No. 45);
(2) SUSTAINS Plaintiff's Objection to the Recommendation as to dismissal of the second and third [*17]  causes of action (ECF No. 46);
(3) ADOPTS the Magistrate Judge's Recommendation as to the first cause of action and REJECTS the Magistrate Judge's Recommendation as to the second and third cause of action (ECF No. 40); and
(4) DENIES Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 23).
