Opinion



ORDER AND REASONS
Before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim (Rec. Doc. 21) filed by Defendant, Columbia/HCA of New Orleans, Inc. d/b/a Lakeview Regional Medical Center, A Campus of Tulane Medical Center. Plaintiff, Virginia Adams, opposes the motion. (Rec. Doc. 22). Defendant filed a reply (Rec. Doc. 25). Having considered the motion and legal memoranda, the record, and the applicable law, the Court finds that the motion should be GRANTED.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
This is an employment discrimination case in which Plaintiff alleges that she was wrongfully terminated on August 9, 2019, for taking prescribed medication to treat symptoms of her disability. After filing a claim with the EEOC, in which Plaintiff alleged that Defendant wrongfully discriminated against her due to her disability in violation of the ADA, the EEOC investigated her claims and subsequently issued a "no cause" determination, dismissal, and notice of right to sue on August 10, 2020. On November 7, 2020, Plaintiff filed suit in this Court, [*2]  alleging that Defendant discriminated against her due to her disability, failed to engage in the ADA's interactive process, failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability, and interfered with her rights under the FMLA. Defendant responded by filing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that Plaintiff did not exhaust her failure to engage in the interactive process claim and failure to accommodate claim in her EEOC charge.
The Court subsequently entered an interlocutory order granting the motion to dismiss and dismissing the aforementioned claims for failure to exhaust her administrative remedies. (Rec. Doc. 13). In response, Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration and attached her EEOC questionnaire that was allegedly unavailable to Plaintiff prior to this Court's Order. (Rec. Doc. 14). In light of the allegations in the questionnaire, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration but also expressly granted Defendant leave to refile its motion to dismiss in order to address whether the questionnaire satisfied the ADA's exhaustion requirement. (Rec. Doc. 20). Defendant subsequently filed the instant motion to dismiss.

LEGAL STANDARD [*3] 
Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The complaint must "give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 346 (2005) (internal citations omitted). The allegations "must be simple, concise, and direct." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1).
"Under Rule 12(b)(6), a claim may be dismissed when a plaintiff fails to allege any set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief." Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir. 2002) (citing McConathy v. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Corp., 131 F.3d 558, 561 (5th Cir. 1998)). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead enough facts to "state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads facts that allow the court to "draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. A court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Lormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., 565 F.3d 228, 232 (5th Cir. 2009); Baker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996). The court is not, however, bound to accept as true legal conclusions couched as factual allegations. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "[C]onclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss." Taylor, 296 F.3d at 378.

DISCUSSION [*4] 
A plaintiff may not file an ADA claim in federal court without first exhausting her statutorily required administrative remedies. See Dao v. Auchan Hypermarket, 96 F.3d 787, 789 (5th Cir. 1996). After the exhaustion requirement is satisfied, any subsequent lawsuit under the ADA is restricted to the scope of the plaintiff's administrative charge and the EEOC investigation that can reasonably be expected to grow out of that charge. Pacheco v. Mineta, 448 F.3d 783, 788-89 (5th Cir. 2006). The scope of an EEOC complaint should be construed liberally. Fellows v. Universal Restaurants, Inc., 701 F.2d 447, 451 (5th Cir. 1983). However, if a plaintiff fails to exhaust her administrative remedies, the court must dismiss the unexhausted claims on their merits. Dao, 96 F. 3d at 788-89.
In the present case, in the EEOC charge under the "Discrimination Based On" heading, Plaintiff checked the box for "Disability," which alone is insufficient to exhaust her failure to accommodate or failure to engage in the interactive process claims. See Spindle v. CKJ Trucking, LP, No. 4:18-CV-818, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46497, 2020 WL 1283519, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 18, 2020). Under the "Particulars" heading, Plaintiff submitted the following description of the alleged discrimination:
I began my employment with Lakeview - a Campus of Tulane (HCA) on or around January 12, 2018 as a Lead Tech, earning $31.85 per hour. On July 26, 2019, I was having severe symptoms due to my disability and had to take [*5]  prescribed medication. After having worked for 5 hours, Ms. Janelle Shemroske, the lab director directed me to go home for being under the influence of the prescribed medication. On July 31, 2019, Ms. Shemroske placed me on paid admin leave pending an investigation into my use of the prescribed medication. On August 9, 2019, I was discharged. The company employs over 500 employees.
According to the company, I was discharged for violating their substance abuse policy.
I have been discriminated against because of my disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act; as amended.
(Rec. Doc. 6, at p. 10). Even construed liberally, nothing in this description references a failure to accommodate or failure to engage in the interactive process.
Plaintiff alleges in her complaint that Defendant was aware of her disability. (Rec. Doc. 1, at ¶11). However, the EEOC charge does not state that Defendant was aware of Plaintiff's disability. (Rec. Doc. 6, at p. 10). If an employer is unaware of a disability, then that employer cannot accommodate or engage in an interactive process to accommodate said disability. See Acker v. Gen. Motors, L.L.C., 853 F.3d 784, 791 (5th Cir. 2017) ("Employees who require accommodation due to a disability are responsible for requesting a reasonable [*6]  accommodation."). Thus, since the EEOC charge does not include any information indicating that Defendant was aware of her disability, the EEOC could not have conducted investigatory and conciliatory procedures into her failure to accommodate or failure to engage in the interactive process claims based on this charge. Allowing Plaintiff to raise these claims for the first time in federal court would be tantamount to circumventing the purpose of these administrative remedies. See Pacheco, 448 F.3d at 789 (analyzing the same process for Title VII claims).
Plaintiff argues that her EEOC questionnaire, which contains allegations that Plaintiff requested reasonable accommodations, should be considered a charge document or part of the charge document. A questionnaire may be deemed a charge if it satisfies the regulatory requirements of a charge and may be "reasonably construed as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employee's rights or otherwise settle a dispute between the employer and the employee." Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U.S. 389, 402, 128 S. Ct. 1147, 170 L. Ed. 2d 10 (2008). EEOC regulations require charge documents to be verified by EEOC personnel. 29 C.F.R. § 1601.7. Plaintiff's questionnaire cannot be deemed a charge document because it is unverified. (Rec. Doc. 21-3, at [*7]  pp. 5-10). Thus, Plaintiff's questionnaire may only be considered if it is deemed part of the charge document.
In Patton v. Jacobs Engineering Group, Incorporated, the Fifth Circuit held that a Plaintiff's intake questionnaire may be considered part of the formal charge of discrimination under certain circumstances. 874 F.3d 437, 443-44 (5th Cir. 2017). In that case, the charge form instructed complainants to attach additional sheets if necessary, and the plaintiff filed both his intake questionnaire and his formal charge of discrimination on the same day. Id. at 443. In addition, the EEOC investigation encompassed claims that were not in the formal charge but were included in the intake questionnaire, which the defendant referenced in its position statement. Id. For these reasons, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the claims in the questionnaire triggered "the investigatory and conciliatory procedures of the EEOC," and thus, "could reasonably be expected to ... grow out of [the] charge of discrimination." Id. at 444 (quoting Pacheco, 448 F.3d at 788-89).
None of the circumstances highlighted by the Fifth Circuit in Patton are present in this case. Although the charge form did instruct Plaintiff to attach additional sheets if necessary, she did not file her intake questionnaire [*8]  and her formal charge together or on the same day. (Rec. Doc. 21-3, at p. 32). Further, Plaintiff has not alleged that the EEOC investigation encompassed her failure to engage in the interactive process or failure to accommodate claims, nor has Plaintiff alleged that Defendant responded to either of these claims in its position statement. For these reasons, Patton does not apply to the present case, and the questionnaire is not part of the formal EEOC charge.
In her opposition, Plaintiff essentially argues that it is unfair to interpret Patton to require the questionnaire and the charge to be filed together or on the same day because the policy of the EEOC has changed. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that the EEOC now requires the questionnaire to be submitted to the EEOC prior to receiving an interview with EEOC personnel to file the formal charge. Plaintiff believes that it typically takes a month to get an interview date after submitting to the questionnaire, as it did in the present case. (Rec. Doc. 21-3, at p. 12). Plaintiff also asserts that EEOC personnel, not the claimants, draft the charge based off of the questionnaire and information obtained in the interview. Thus, Plaintiff [*9]  argues that it would be fundamentally unfair to prevent her from pursuing claims included in her questionnaire due to the EEOC personnel's failure to include them in the formal charge.
Regardless of who drafted the charge, Plaintiff's argument ignores the fact that she read and digitally signed the charge under penalty of perjury. (Rec. Doc. 21-3, at p. 32). If Plaintiff wanted to include her other claims in her charge, she could have asked for them to be included before signing it. Further, as stated above, the charge document includes instructions to attach additional paper to the formal charge if necessary. Id. Plaintiff has not provided any reason that she could not have attached a copy of the questionnaire or attached any other documents referencing her claims for failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process. Therefore, the Court must conclude that Plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies regarding these claims. See McClain v. Lufkin Industries, Inc., 519 F.3d 264, 274 (5th Cir. 2008) ("Courts should not condone lawsuits that exceed the scope of EEOC exhaustion, because doing so would thwart the administrative process and peremptorily substitute litigation for conciliation.").

CONCLUSION
Accordingly,
IT IS [*10]  ORDERED that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Rec. Doc. 21) is GRANTED. Plaintiff's claims for failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process are hereby DISMISSED with prejudice.
New Orleans, Louisiana, this 8th day of April, 2021.
