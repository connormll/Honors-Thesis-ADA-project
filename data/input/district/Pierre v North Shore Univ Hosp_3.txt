MEMORANDUM & ORDER
PLATT, District Judge:
Pending is Defendant's Summary-Judgment Motion. For the reasons discussed below, Defendant's Motion is GRANTED.

Facts
Beginning on September 11, 1989, Defendant North Shore University Hospital ("Hospital" or "Defendant") employed Plaintiff Marie Pierre ("Plaintiff" or "Pierre") as a Certified Nursing Assistant ("CNA"). (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 1.) Plaintiffs main responsibilities concerned patient care. (Id. P 2.) As of 2004, she was employed at the Hospital's CECR facility--one of its two facilities that employ CNAs. (Id. PP 3-5.)
Beginning in 2004, Plaintiff's knees became arthritic. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 7.) This ultimately led to knee-replacement surgery in May 2004. (Id. P 6.) Prior to this surgery, Pierre did not tell her superiors that she was having knee issues, or of her diagnosis. (Id. P 7.) But since she would be unable to work for an extended period following  [*2] her surgery, Plaintiff submitted a leave-of-absence request, along with a certification, notifying the Hospital of her leave need. (Id. P 8.) The Hospital approved Plaintiff's request. (Id. P 14.)
The Hospital's injury/illness-leave policy automatically reinstates employees that return from leave within 12 weeks at their previous position; they have 12 weeks of job-guaranteed leave per year. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. PP 9, 11.) If they return after 12 weeks, but before 26 weeks, they will be offered either their old position or a comparable one, depending on availability. (Id.) If neither type of position is available, then employees will be given a preference for the next available position. (Id.) Defendant asserts that in 2004 and 2005, if an employee returned between 12 and 26 weeks, to be considered for a new position, he or she had to contact the Hospital's talent acquisition office, and the employee would be treated as a preferential in-house applicant. (Id. P 10.) Plaintiff states this is contrary to the written Leave Policy. (Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 10.)
Plaintiff was certified to return to work, following her surgery, on August 9, 2004--within 12 weeks. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 16.)  [*3] This return did not require any additional accommodations. (Id. P 17.)
In 2005, Plaintiff required surgery on her other knee. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 18.) It was scheduled for May 23, 2005. (Id. P 19.) Since Plaintiff was advised that this second surgery would be more difficult than her 2004 surgery, Plaintiff requested vacation time in addition to a medical leave. (Id. P 18.) These vacations were from August 22, 2005 to September 4, 2005, and from May 16, 2005 to May 23, 2005. (Id. PP 18, 21.) This made May 16, 2005 her last day of work. (Id. P 21.) The Hospital granted all leave and vacation requests. (Id. P 22.) Although these requests were approved, Plaintiff's boss--Ms. Patterson--still did not like the idea of Plaintiff's second surgery and requested that she postpone it. (Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 22.) Plaintiff did not do so.
Plaintiff returned to work on August 16, 2005, and worked 30 hours until her vacation commenced on August 22, 2005. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 28.) During this time, no one said anything to her about her time off. (Id. P 29.)
While on vacation, Plaintiff noticed swelling in her knee. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 30.) Her surgeon advised her to take additional leave,  [*4] and not to return to work "until further notice and re-eval[uation]." (Id. PP 31-32.)
Although scheduled to return to work from vacation on September 4, 2005, Plaintiff did not return that day. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 33.) Despite a policy that required her to phone the CECR at least one hour prior to her shift's starting time to report that she would be out, she did not do so. (Id. PP 34-35.) But Plaintiff asserts that prior to September 4, she provided the "employee benefits" department a note that indicated she would not return that day. (Pl's R. 56.1 Stmt. PP 33-34.) Plaintiff did not call the CECR on September 4, 5, or 6, despite not showing up for work on those days. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. PP 35-37.) On September 7, Barbara Southard--the Hospital's Director of nursing, but not Plaintiff's supervisor--telephoned Plaintiff and left a message. (Id. PP 38-39.) The following day, Plaintiff called Southard back, and Southard advised her that she had exceeded that year's amount of leave for which her position would be guaranteed. (Id. P 40.) Southard told Plaintiff to contact her, when Plaintiff was ready and able to return, about any comparable positions that might then be available.  [*5] (Id. P 41.)
When Plaintiff extended her leave of absence on September 9, 2005, she exceeded her 12 weeks of leave. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. PP 43-44.) The Hospital then posted her position as open. (Id. P 44.) On September 23, 2005, Plaintiff was certified to return to work as of September 28. (Id. P 45.) But on September 25, Plaintiff's old position was offered to CNA James Fatorma. (Id. P 47.) The Hospital asserts that when the Fatorma-offer was made, it had not yet been notified that Plaintiff could return to work on September 28. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 48.)
On September 28, Southard called Plaintiff and told her not to report for work that day because there were no available positions, and to instead call the Hospital's Human-Resources Department ("HR"). (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. PP 54-55.) Plaintiff did call HR, but the Hospital asserts that Plaintiff never inquired about any available openings. (Id. PP 57, 60-62.) Plaintiff counters that it was not her responsibility to actively seek out positions, but rather under the Hospital's policy, she should have been given preference as any positions opened. (Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. PP 60-62.) 1 
The Hospital fired Plaintiff on December 5, 2005, because she failed to return to work from her medical leave within 12 weeks, and failed to seek and obtain a comparable CNA position as required by the Hospital's leave policy. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 63.) Plaintiff disputes that her termination was due to the fact that she failed to seek and obtain a comparable position. (Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 63.) She also asserts that she attempted to contact Defendant's president but never received a return call. (Id. P 64.) The Hospital states that she never actively sought another job, never complained about any adverse comments, and never requested any accommodation due to her arthritis. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. PP 64-66.)
On June 1, 2006, the Hospital made an unconditional offer of reemployment to Plaintiff to restore her to her former position with the same benefits, seniority, and terms and conditions as before. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 68.) Plaintiff did not accept this offer. (Id. P 69.) She did receive unemployment benefits for six months, with the final check dated April 12, 2006.  [*7] (Id. PP 72-73.)
Since December 2006, Plaintiff has worked at Sands Point Nursing Home as a full-time per-diem CNA. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 74.) She is no longer being treated for arthritis or any knee-related conditions. (Id. P 75.)
Plaintiff first consulted an attorney regarding legal action against the Hospital in October 2005--prior to her December 2005 termination. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 76.) On October 11, 2005, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging age and disability discrimination. (Id. P 77.) On April 3, 2008, the EEOC issued a letter concluding that there was no probable cause to find that the Defendant had discriminated against Plaintiff based on age or disability, and it had provided a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the termination. (Id. P 78.) The EEOC found that Plaintiff remained on disability leave beyond the time allotted in the Hospital's policy, the Hospital needed to fill the position, and offered reinstatement to a similar position nine-months later, which Plaintiff declined. (Id. P 79.)
Plaintiff filed the instant action on June 4, 2008. (See Compl.) She alleges violations of the Americans  [*8] with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), and the New York Human Rights Law ("NYHRL"). (Id.)

Discussion

A. Summary-Judgment Standard
A summary-judgment motion may not be granted unless the court determines that there is "no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). "Summary judgment may be granted if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Williams v. R.H. Donnelley, Corp., 368 F.3d 123 (2d Cir. 2004). The court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Id. at 255; Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Group, 150 F.3d 132, 137 (2d Cir. 1998). "A party opposing a properly brought motion for summary judgment bears the burden of going beyond the [specific] pleadings, and 'designating specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Amnesty Am. v. Town of W. Hartford, 288 F.3d 467, 470 (2d Cir. 2002)  [*9] (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). If there is any evidence in the record from which a reasonable inference may be drawn in favor of the non-moving party on a material issue of fact summary judgment is improper. Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 37 (2d Cir. 1994). "[T]he judge's role in reviewing a motion for summary judgment is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. "[T]here is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party." Id.
Summary-judgment motions in employment-discrimination cases "should be evaluated with special care." Cody v. County of Nassau, 577 F. Supp. 2d 623, 636 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (citing Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir. 1997)). Because "direct evidence of an employer's discriminatory intent will rarely be found, 'affidavits and depositions must be carefully scrutinized for circumstantial proof which, if believed, would show discrimination.'" Cody, 577 F. Supp. 2d at 636 (citing Schwapp, 118 F.3d at 110).  [*10] Even in this context, plaintiffs must still "provide more than conclusory allegations of discrimination to defeat a motion for summary judgment." Cody, 577 F. Supp. 2d at 636 (citing Schwapp, 118 F.3d at 110).

B. Plaintiff is not "Disabled" Under the ADA
"The ADA 2 prohibits employers from discriminating 'against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.'" Leahy v. Gap, Inc., No. 07-CV-2008, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58812, 2008 WL 2946007, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. July 29, 2008) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). Employers of disabled persons are "required to make reasonable accommodations for otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities and are prohibited from retaliating against an employee engaged in activities protected under the statute." Leahy, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58812, 2008 WL 2946007, at *4 (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112(b)(5)(A)), 12203(b)).
Four elements are required to make out a prima facie case under the ADA. Giordano v. City of N.Y., 274 F.3d 740, 747 (2d Cir. 2001). To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must prove: "(1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) he suffered adverse employment action because of his disability." Id. An essential element is thus that the plaintiff is "disabled" as defined under the ADA. See Leahy, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58812, 2008 WL 2946007, at *4 ("An essential element of a claim for failure to accommodate is that the plaintiff be an individual with a 'disability' within the meaning of the statute." (citing cases)).
The ADA defines a disability, "with respect to an individual[:] (A) a physical or mental impairment 3 that substantially limits 4 one or more major life activities 5 of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3))." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). A person is "regarded  [*13] as having" an impairment where "the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." Id. § 12102(3)(A). In determining whether the person is "substantially limited," courts consider "the nature and severity of the impairment, the duration or expected duration of the impairment, and the permanent or long term impact of or the expected long term impact of or resulting from the impairment. . . . For purposes of the ADA, short term, temporary restrictions are not 'substantially limiting' and do not render a person 'disabled.'" Leahy, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58812, 2008 WL 2946007, at *4 (quoting Conley v. United Parcel Serv., 88 F. Supp. 2d 16, 19 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Smith, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69995, 2009 WL 2447754, at *14. A Judge in the Southern District, discussing the issue in 2008, stated:
To establish a disability under the ADA, there must be some proof of permanency. See Adams v. Citizens Advice Bureau, 187 F.3d 315, 316-17 (2d Cir. 1999). In other words, the limitation on the claimed major life activity  [*14] cannot be temporary. Id. (temporary neck, back, and knee injury lasting three and a half months not a disability); Colwell v. Suffolk County Police Dep't, 158 F.3d 635, 646 (2d Cir. 1998) (temporary impairment of seven months not substantially limiting); McNamara v. Tourneau, Inc., 496 F. Supp. 2d 366, 376 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (injury lasting only eight weeks not a qualifying disability); Williams v. Salvation Army, 108 F. Supp. 2d 303, 312-13 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (temporary, non-chronic impairments of short duration, with little or no long-term or permanent impact, are usually not "disabilities.").
Green v. N.Y. City Health & Hosp. Corp., No. 04-CV-5144, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2832, 2008 WL 144828, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2008).
Many Courts have held that arthritis is not a "disability" under the ADA. See Smith v. St. Luke's Roosevelt Hosp., No. 08-CV-4710, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69995, 2009 WL 2447754, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 11, 2009) (" 'arthritis' is not a disability covered under the ADA."). While  [*16] arthritis does constitute an "impairment," 6 and working is a "major life activity," 7 courts often have found that plaintiffs could not satisfy 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)'s third requirement that the impairment "substantially limited" a major life activity. Smith, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69995, 2009 WL 2447754, at *15. 
Courts have consistently held that arthritis does not substantially limit plaintiffs in the major life activity of working. "In order for a plaintiff to be found substantially limited in the major life activity of working, the plaintiff must be 'unable to work in a broad class of jobs.' Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 491, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999), superseded by, ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008). Thus, "[t]he inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(I). Instead, the "ability to work is substantially limited . . . if the plaintiff is 'significantly restricted in the ability to perform either  [*18] a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.'" Colwell, 158 F.3d at 641 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(I)); Heilweil v. Mount Sinai Hosp., 32 F.3d 718, 723 (2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1147, 115 S. Ct. 1095, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1063 (1995) ("[A] person found unsuitable for a particular position has not thereby demonstrated an impairment substantially limiting such person's major life activity of working.").
But courts have sometimes found arthritic plaintiffs were "disabled" under the ADA where their arthritis substantially limited the major life activity of "walking." See Shaw, 137 F. Supp. 2d at 55 ("Arthritis can qualify as a disability under the ADA."); see also Shott v. Rush-Presbyterian, No. 94-CV-6783, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8014, 2000 WL 765068, at *1 (N.D. Ill. June 9, 2000) ("There is no dispute that plaintiff, a statistician and faculty member at Rush, is severely disabled by rheumatoid arthritis."); Littlefield v. York County, No. 99-CV-277, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20907, 2000 WL 760959, at *5 (D. Me. Apr. 28, 2000) (denying summary judgment on an ADA claim where arthritis pain prevented plaintiff from walking 100-200 feet, since  [*19] walking is a major life activity under the ADA); Stafne v. Unicare Homes, Inc., No. 97-CV-470, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2848, 1999 WL 1068490, at *7 (D. Minn. Mar. 3, 1999) (denying summary judgment on an ADA claim where a permanent arthritic condition prevented plaintiff from walking for more than five minutes without pain, walking for more than two city blocks without pain, caused difficulty going up and down stairs, walking on uneven terrain at all, and necessitating braces on both legs). Plaintiff here alleges in a conclusory fashion, without any evidence or details how, 8 that her arthritis substantially limited her ability to walk. (Pl.'s Mem. L. 7.)
"The determination of whether an individual is disabled under the ADA is made on an individualized, case-by-case basis." Reeves v. Johnson Controls World Servs., Inc., 140 F.3d 144, 151 (2d Cir. 1998). Simply because an arthritic plaintiff in one case was found not to be disabled, does not mean that this Plaintiff  [*20] is not disabled. See, e.g., Reeves, 140 F.3d at 151 ("Accordingly, we held in our recent decision in Ryan that the plaintiff's physical impairment, 'ulcerative colitis,' in his particular case did not substantially limit the major life activity of 'caring for oneself,' but we emphasized that 'our decision does not mean that colitis may never impose such a limitation.'" (emphasis in original)). Similarly, just because other cases have held that arthritic plaintiffs could be considered "disabled" does not mean that all arthritic plaintiffs would be considered "disabled" under the ADA. See Ryan v. Grae & Rybicki, P.C., 135 F.3d 867, 872 (2d Cir. 1998) ("the cases which have considered whether an individual with colitis is 'disabled' do not affect the conclusion [on plaintiff's disability] we reach here.").
In order for Plaintiff to prove that she suffers from a disability that substantially limits a major life activity, she is required to "do more than 'merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment.'" Covello, 212 F. Supp. 2d at 118 (quoting Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 198). Rather, "the ADA requires those claiming the Act's protection . . . to prove a disability by  [*21] offering evidence that the extent of the limitation [caused by the impairment] in terms of their own experience . . . is substantial." Covello, 212 F. Supp. 2d at 119 (quoting Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 198) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). Thus, "a plaintiff cannot prevail on an ADA disability discrimination claim where [she] merely submits evidence that [she] suffers from [an impairment]." Sussle v. Sirina Prot. Sys. Corp., 269 F. Supp. 2d 285, 296 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).
Pierre has alleged that arthritis has substantially impaired her major life activity of walking. (Pl.'s Mem. L. 7.) As outlined above, arthritis constitutes an impairment, walking is a major life activity, and Plaintiff alleges that her arthritis substantially limits her ability to walk. But she has not set forth any evidence of (i) how her impairment affected her walking; and (ii) how--if at all--her ability was limited. In short, she has submitted evidence of a limitation--arthritis--but has not submitted any evidence that she was substantially limited.
Further, as noted above, to be a "disability" under the ADA, the impairment must be permanent and not temporary. While it may be true  [*22] that Plaintiff's ability to walk was limited prior to surgery, Plaintiff submits no evidence that following her surgeries she remains substantially limited in her ability to walk. And as Defendant pointed out at oral argument, and as Plaintiff admitted (Pl.'s Mem L. 8), her knee replacement surgery has "cured" her arthritis. Since Plaintiff submitted no evidence demonstrating that her disability is permanent, she cannot be considered "disabled" under the ADA.
Moreover, the threshold to be considered "substantially limited" in one's ability to walk is very high. See, e.g., Gretillat v. Care Initiatives, 481 F.3d 649, 655 (8th Cir. 2007) (holding that the plaintiff there was not "disabled" where she had knee replacement surgery, subsequently suffered pain while walking, and had difficulty walking long distances, because "her impairment [did] not prevent her from accomplishing tasks central to people's daily lives provided that she [took] breaks."); Wood v. Crown Redi-Mix, Inc., 339 F.3d 682, 685 (8th Cir. 2003) (holding that the plaintiff was not disabled where he could only walk one-quarter of one mile before requiring rest, was numb in parts of his toes and left leg, his left knee would  [*23] collapse, and he walked with a cane on occasion, because the court considered his walking limitations moderate, and not substantial, thus finding that his ability to walk was not substantially limited.); Weber v. Strippit, Inc., 186 F.3d 907, 914 (8th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1078, 120 S. Ct. 794, 145 L. Ed. 2d 670 (2000) ("difficulty walking long distances or climbing stairs without getting fatigued" are "moderate limitations on major life activities [that] do not suffice to constitute a 'disability' under the ADA."); Williams v. Silvey, No 09-CV-211, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24929, 2009 WL 2231670, at *4 (E.D. Mo. 2009) (denying an ADA claim because plaintiff was not substantially limited where she was claimed she was "disabled due to her total knee replacement and that she sometimes has difficulty walking, which is a major life activity."); Gallimore v. Newman Machine Co., Inc., 301 F. Supp. 2d 431, 446 (M.D.N.C. 2004) (holding plaintiff was not substantially impaired in walking, and thus not disabled under the ADA, where after having both hips replaced: "(1) 'he walked with great difficulty and could not walk any significant distance without pain and sometimes had to use a cane,' (2) 'he could only  [*24] lift his feet a few inches off the floor,' (3) 'he could not put one foot in front of the other,' (4) 'he could not go up or down steps without pain,' (5) 'he could not climb or descend steps or stairs without using his arms to pull him up or steady his descent,' and (6) 'he had to install handles in his house at all the steps and doors so he could get through them' . . . [and] walked 'with a very noticeable limp.'"). As discussed above, Plaintiff here provided no details or evidence on how her arthritis limited her ability to walk, besides that she was bowlegged. She asserts her limitations only in conclusory terms.
Based on what other courts have considered substantial limitations on the major life activity of walking, Plaintiff's conclusory allegations are insufficient to demonstrate she was "disabled" under the ADA. She only claims that her arthritis caused her to become bowlegged (prior to surgery) and impaired her ability to walk. (Pl.'s Mem. L. 7; Def.'s Ex. 1, 39:8-9; 9 Compl. P 11 ("These disabilities substantially have and do limit one or more of Pierre's major life activities.")). Moreover, Plaintiff admits that her arthritis was cured. (Def.'s Mem. L. 8 ("Admittedly, Plaintiff  [*25] no longer suffers from arthritis in her knees, due only to her having two total knee replacement surgeries.").) There is no evidence in the record demonstrating a substantial limitation on Plaintiff's ability to walk. Her temporary and moderate limitation does not constitute a disability under the ADA.

C. Plaintiff was not "Regarded As" Disabled
Even though Plaintiff has not shown that she suffers from a disability under the ADA, she could still be considered "disabled" for ADA purposes if she demonstrated that she was "regarded as having such an impairment." 10 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(C). "This more subjective definition of disability is available to a plaintiff who suffers employment discrimination not on the basis of an actual disability but on the basis of myths, fears, and stereotypes that lead her employer to the erroneous conclusion that she is substantially impaired." Cerrato v. Durham, 941 F. Supp. 388, 393-94 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). "For a plaintiff to prevail on a perceived disability claim, he or she would have to show[:]
. that the employer treated plaintiff as having an impairment that substantially limited one or more of the plaintiff's  [*26] major life activities[;] and that either
. while he or she had a physical or mental impairment, it was not substantially limiting[;] or
. that he or she did not suffer at all from a statutorily prescribed physical or mental impairment."
Greenberg v. New York State, 919 F. Supp. 637, 641 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (citing Cook v. R.I. Dep't of Mental Health, Retardation & Hosps., 10 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1993)) (formatting not in original)). "Thus, 'if an individual can show that an employer . . . made an employment decision because of a perception of disability based on "myth, fear or stereotype," the individual will satisfy the "regarded as" part of the definition of disability.'" Greenberg, 919 F. Supp. at 641 (quoting Cook, 10 F.3d at 22). "Regarded as" liability "turns on the employer's perception of the employee, a question of intent, not whether the employee has a disability." Francis v. City of Meriden, 129 F.3d 281, 284 (2d Cir. 1997). And "to state a claim under the 'regarded as' disabled prong of the ADA . . ., a plaintiff must allege that his employer regarded him as having an 'impairment' within the meaning of the statute []." Id. Stated another way, "the plaintiff must allege that the  [*27] employer believed, however erroneously, that the plaintiff suffered from an 'impairment' that, if it truly existed, would be covered under the statutes and that the employer discriminated against the plaintiff on that basis." Id.; see also Capobianco v. City of N.Y., 422 F.3d 47, 57 (2d Cir. 2005) ("It is not enough that the employer perceive the employee as 'somehow disabled'; the employer must regard the employee as 'disabled within the meaning of the ADA,' i.e., having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity."). Moreover, a plaintiff must prove more than an employer's simple awareness of an employee's impairment. Mitchell v. Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., No. 98-CV-3730, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20570, 2003 WL 22705121, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2003) ("An employer's awareness of 'an employee's impairment is insufficient to demonstrate either that the employer regarded the employee as disabled or that the perception caused the adverse employment action.'"); see also Reeves, 140 F.3d at 153 ("the mere fact that an employer is aware of an employee's impairment is insufficient to demonstrate either that the employer regarded the employee as disabled or that that perception caused the adverse employment  [*28] action." (quoting Kelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d 102, 109 (3d Cir. 1996))).
Plaintiff has submitted no evidence that the Hospital regarded her as disabled. First off, the Hospital became aware of Pierre's arthritis in May 2004, when she first filed for a leave of absence. But the Hospital's alleged discrimination did not occur until September 2005--over a year later. Plaintiff fails to allege--and provides no evidence of--a causal link between her arthritis (the alleged regarded-as disability) and her eventual firing. Even though Defendant may have perceived Plaintiff  [*29] as having a medical condition--arthritis, and was possibly aware of this condition, 11 this is insufficient, alone, to demonstrate that the Hospital "regarded her" as having an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity. Plaintiff's showing of the Hospital's awareness--without providing any evidence of discrimination--is inadequate to make out an ADA "regarded as" claim. In fact, the evidence demonstrates that Defendant wanted to retain her. For example, the Hospital reminded Plaintiff she needed to return within three months to guarantee her position under the leave policy. (Def.'s Ex. 1, 61:23-25.) And the Hospital also did not want Plaintiff to have the second surgery because it wanted her at work, working. (Def.'s Ex. 1, 78-82.) Furthermore, as discussed below, the Hospital had legitimate business reasons to fire Plaintiff. There is thus no evidence of any "regarded as" discrimination, and no material issues of fact.

D. Plaintiff was Fired for Legitimate Business Reasons
The record supports Defendant's claim that Plaintiff was eventually fired because she never sought a new position within the Hospital after one was not initially available. But rather than presenting evidence that this reason was pretext, Plaintiff simply provides conclusory allegations of discrimination. Plaintiff may not defeat a summary-judgment motion through conclusory statements that she was fired because of her arthritis. She must offer some evidence--although direct evidence is not necessary--"'constituting a prima facie case, together with supportable inferences to be drawn from the false or erroneous character of the employer's proffered reasons,' that the defendant's proffered reason was pretextual." Kinsella v. Rumsfeld, 320 F.3d 309, 314 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting Carlton v. Mystic Transp., Inc., 202 F.3d 129, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000)). She simply has not done that here.
Plaintiff has failed to show circumstances from which a discriminatory inference may be drawn. She has offered no evidence from which one might be able to reasonably conclude or infer that she suffered an adverse employment action because  [*31] of a disability. The mere fact that Plaintiff disagrees with her employer's interpretation of its medical-leave policy may not, standing alone, raise a genuine issue of fact that the defendant's reason for her firing was pretextual.
Moreover, Plaintiff admitted in her deposition that she was not told on September 5, or September 28, 2005 that she was, at either point, fired. (Def.'s Ex. 1, 159:20-21, 174:13-14.) Her attempts to create a contradiction in her deposition does not create an issue of fact for trial; self contradictions do not create material issues of fact. See Hayes v. N. Y. City Dep't of Corr., 84 F.3d 614, 619 (2d Cir. 1996) ("a party may not create an issue of fact by submitting an affidavit in opposition to a summary judgment motion that, by omission or addition, contradicts the affiant's previous deposition testimony."); Fodelmesi v. Schepperly, No. 87-CV-6762, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5161, 1993 WL 127211, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 1993) ("attempts to create an issue of fact through self-contradiction have been consistently rejected."); cf. Perma Research & Dev. Co. v. Singer Co., 410 F.2d 572, 578 (2d Cir. 1969) ("If a party who has been examined at length on deposition could raise an issue of  [*32] fact simply by submitting an affidavit contradicting his own prior testimony, this would greatly diminish the utility of summary judgment as a procedure for screening out sham issues of fact."); Christiana Bank & Trust Co. v. Dalton, No. 06-CV-3206, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108172, 2009 WL 4016507, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2009) ("a self-serving, contradictory affidavit fails to raise a triable issue of fact when it conflicts with documentary evidence."); Wininger v. Searles, No. 02-CV-747, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73998, 2006 WL 2839136, at *6 (D. Conn. Aug. 4, 2006) ("A party may not create a genuine issue of material fact simply by presenting contradictory or unsupported statements. Nor may he rest on 'allegations or denials' contained in his pleadings." (citations omitted)); Martin v. New York., 627 F. Supp. 892, 896 (E.D.N.Y. 1985) (discussing the "well-settled rule that 'a party cannot create a material question of fact simply by contradicting testimony given at a deposition.'"); Price v. Worldvision Enters., Inc., 455 F. Supp. 252, 266 n.25 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (acknowledging that "[i]ssues of credibility sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment are not created if the contradicting or impeaching evidence is too incredible to be believed  [*33] by reasonable minds." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), aff'd without opinion, 603 F.2d 214 (2d Cir. 1979)).
Here, although Plaintiff seeks to create a self-serving contradiction, there is no contradiction. On September 5, 2005, when Plaintiff did not return within 12 weeks from her leave, Ms. Southard told her, that although her position was being listed as open, "don't worry, when you come back, I'll give you anything I have." 12 (Def.'s Ex. 1, 159:20-21.). Then, on September 28, Ms. Southard told Plaintiff that she did not have a position for her. (Id. at 174:13-14.) Plaintiff explicitly stated that she was not fired at that time. (Id. ("She didn't tell me I was fired. She just said she have [sic] no position for me.").)
Rather, the evidence demonstrates that the Hospital had legitimate business reasons for terminating Plaintiff's employment. On the date she was supposed to return to work, she simply did not show up, and sent  [*34] a letter to "employee benefit." (Def.'s Ex. 1, 130:21-24.) She did not take the courteous--and required--step of calling someone at the CECR to let them know that she would not return to work that day. (Id. at 131:2-4.) She did not call the CECR for the next two days either--despite, again, not showing up for work. (Id. at 132:15-20.) When Ms. Southard finally was able to speak with Plaintiff, Plaintiff could not even provide a definite date on which she could return to work. (Id. at 135-36.) Instead, Plaintiff said she was being reevaluated on September 23, and would then find out when she could return. (Id.) The Hospital was within its right to offer Plaintiff's job to another applicant as she did not return to work within 12 weeks. And Plaintiff was not offered another position for the simple reason that, at that point, none were available. Further, in the following weeks, Plaintiff made no effort to see if any new positions opened up within the Hospital. She provided no evidence that the Hospital regarded her as handicapped, and as the above facts indicate, the Hospital had a legitimate business reason for terminating Plaintiff.

E. The Hospital did not "Fail to Accommodate"  [*35] Plaintiff
Plaintiff claims that she could have performed her job if she was granted a reasonable accommodation. "A claim of disability discrimination arising from termination of an employee based on failure to accommodate is not made out under the ADA unless the employee's request for a reasonable accommodation has been denied by the employer." Mazza v. Bratton, 108 F. Supp. 2d 167, 176 (E.D.N.Y. 2000). This "duty to make reasonable accommodations does not require an employer to hold open a disabled employee's position indefinitely, nor does it require the employer 'to investigate every aspect of an employee's condition before terminating him based on his inability to work.'" Mazza, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 176 (quoting Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 338 (2d Cir. 2000)).
Plaintiff argues that the Hospital should have held her position open "for a matter of weeks." But at the time her position was offered to another applicant, the Hospital was still in the dark as to when she could finally return. (Patterson Decl. PP 6-12.) Plaintiff had simply failed to return to work following her vacation--exceeding her allotted 12 weeks of leave. (Def.'s Ex. 1, 130:21-24.) She did not  [*36] let the Hospital know when she could return, or that she could return if certain accommodations were provided. Plaintiff does not identify any specific accommodations that would have allowed her to return from leave within 12 weeks, or at least earlier than September 28, 2005 (when she was cleared to return). (Pl.'s Mem. L. 10-11.) And once Plaintiff was able to return, there were simply no available positions for her. Then she never followed up with the Hospital to see if any positions had opened up. Instead, she filed a claim with the EEOC. (Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. P 77.) Plaintiff did not seek part-time work, or any other compromise following her vacation and leave. She just sent a note to the employee-benefits department, and remained at home. The Hospital was not required to hold Plaintiff's position open indefinitely, and did not violate the ADA.

F. Plaintiff was not "Otherwise Qualified" for her Job
One of the elements of an ADA claim is that the plaintiff must be "otherwise qualified" for his or her job. Giordano, 274 F.3d at 747. " 'Otherwise qualified' means that the individual 'with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position  [*37] that such individual holds or desires.'" Bobrowsky v. N.Y. City Bd. of Educ, No. 97-CV-874, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14528, 1999 WL 737919, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, 1999), aff'd mem., 213 F.3d 625 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Lyons v. Legal Aid Soc'y, 68 F.3d 1512, 1514 (2d Cir. 1995)).
Plaintiff was not "otherwise qualified" for her position when she failed to return to work--and could not return--as per her doctor's orders. Mazza, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 175 ("An individual is not qualified for his position if he is unable to come to work."); Bobrowsky, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14528, 1999 WL 737919, at *4 ("Courts have consistently ruled that 'an employee cannot be considered otherwise qualified when she is unable to report to work at the time required, because she is not able to perform the essential functions of her job.'" (quoting Davis v. Bowes, No. 95-CV-4765, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16258, 1997 WL 655935, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 1997))). Here, after Plaintiff's second surgery, she returned to work for four days, and then went on a pre-scheduled vacation. But she did not return to work following that vacation, as planned, on September 4. Instead, she sent a letter to "employee benefit" and remained at home. (Def.'s Ex. 1, 130:21-24.) She never bothered to call the CECR to let  [*38] someone know that she would not return to work that day. (Id. at 131:2-4.) In fact, she did not call that day, the next day, or the following day--despite never showing up for work. (Id. at 132:15-20.) When Ms. Southard finally connected with Plaintiff, Plaintiff could not even provide a date on which she would return to work. (Id. at 135-36.) Instead, Plaintiff said she was being reevaluated on September 23, and would then find out when she could return. (Id.) Because Plaintiff was not cleared by her doctor to return to work, and did not return to work, she was not "otherwise qualified" for her position. Once she was able to return to work, there were no available positions for her. There was no ADA violation since Plaintiff was not "otherwise qualified" since she was unavailable to work.

G. This Court Declines Supplemental Jurisdiction Over Plaintiff's New York Human Rights Law Claim
In addition to her federal claim, Plaintiff also asserts State-law claims under the New York Human Rights Law. (See Compl. P 32.) As the Court has dismissed Plaintiff's federal claims, only the State-law claims remain. But before the Court considers whether summary judgment is appropriate on these claims,  [*39] it must consider whether it has subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the claims, since jurisdiction was originally based on a federal question. "While the statute governing supplemental jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1367, does not require dismissal of pendent state-law claims where all of the federal claims have been dismissed, see id. § 1367(c)(3), 'if it appears that the state law issues substantially predominate, whether in terms of proof, of the scope of the issues raised, or of the comprehensiveness of the remedy sought, the state law claims may be dismissed without prejudice and left for resolution to state tribunals.'" Giordano, 274 F.3d at 740 (citing United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726-27, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966)). The Supreme Court has cautioned, however, that "[t]here may . . . be situations in which the state claim is so closely tied to questions of federal policy that the argument for exercise of pendent jurisdiction is particularly strong." United Mine Workers, 383 U.S. at 726. That is not the case here. No federal policy compels this Court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's NYHRL claims. The Court has already determined that Plaintiff  [*40] has not demonstrated a "disability" under the ADA, and the major difference between the ADA and the NYHRL is New York's broader definition of a "disability." Woolley v. Broadview Networks, Inc., No. 01-CV-2526, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2716, 2003 WL 554754, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2003) ("The legal standards for discrimination claims under the ADA and under New York state . . . law are essentially the same, except to the extent that the New York statutes support a broader definition of 'disability' . . . ." (citing Reeves, 140 F.3d at 147)).
The argument for exercising pendant jurisdiction here is not particularly strong, and the Court declines to exercise it over Plaintiff's State-law claims. Plaintiff's NYHRL claims are dismissed without prejudice. So long as she meets the New York State courts' filing requirements, she may refile them in State court.

Conclusion
For the reasons discussed above, Defendant's motion is GRANTED.
SO ORDERED.
