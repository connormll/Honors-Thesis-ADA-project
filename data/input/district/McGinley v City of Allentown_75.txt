Opinion



ORDER
AND NOW, this 18th day of June 2012, upon consideration of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 9) and Plaintiff's Response Thereto (Doc. No. 11), it is hereby ORDERED that the motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.
I. Factual Background
The operative facts in this action alleging discrimination on the basis of disability, as recited in Plaintiff's complaint, are as follows.
Plaintiff Dennis McGinley began working for the Parks Maintenance Department of Allentown in 1974. Beginning in 1995, he suffered a series of injuries that are the subject of the instant lawsuit. In April 1995, Plaintiff received a total left hip replacement. Ten years later, in December of 2005, Plaintiff's other hip was replaced. Finally, in December of 2006, Plaintiff suffered a work related injury to his wrist. Plaintiff avers that, as a result, he underwent six surgeries from  [*2] December 12, 2006 through August 4, 2009. Plaintiff further avers that after his December 12, 2006 surgery, he was assigned to light duty work until his second surgery of March 1, 2007. After his return from this second surgery, he was returned to a modified duty assignment through September 12, 2007, at which time he was returned to full duty. Plaintiff next appears to allege that although he was given a return to work certificate on February 28, 2008, 1 which recommended indoor work, he again underwent surgery in September 2008 on his wrist after further injuring it. In January 2010, Plaintiff was discharged from physical therapy. On February 24, 2010, Plaintiff's doctor performed a Functional Capacity Evaluation, which Plaintiff needed in order to return to work.
On March 4, 2010, Defendant's Labor Relations Officer, Tara M. Williams, sent Plaintiff a letter indicating that during his time away from work, Plaintiff's job as a Recycling and Solid Waste  [*3] Aide was eliminated on July 15, 2009, and that Plaintiff had been bumped to the position of Recycling Maintenance Worker II, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. Either in the same letter, or in another letter of the same date, Defendant further referred to Plaintiff's February 24th Functional Capacity Evaluation, the results of which Plaintiff appears not to have himself received until a later date, 2 and communicated that Plaintiff no longer qualified for the Maintenance Worker II position to which he had been bumped because he could no longer lift seventy pounds.
Finally, on May 27, 2010, Plaintiff received a phone call from Human Resources informing him of his termination. Plaintiff subsequently filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission ("PHRC"), alleging that he was discriminated against on the basis of his disability.
Plaintiff  [*4] subsequently filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County, and Defendant removed the action to federal court on February 7, 2012. In his amended complaint, Plaintiff charges violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act ("PHRA"), and a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Defendant has moved to dismiss each count of the Amended Complaint, and we address each argument in turn.
II. Legal Standard
A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint's allegations on the grounds that they fail "to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." The Court must accept as true "[t]he facts alleged in the complaint and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts." Farber v. City of Paterson, 440 F.3d 131, 134 (3d Cir. 2006). Rule 8(a) requires that a complaint contain a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." The Supreme Court has held that a complaint need not include detailed factual allegations to withstand dismissal, but must comprise "more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of  [*5] the cause of action will not do." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). Moreover, "[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." See id. "To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). "Determining whether the complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1950.
III. Discrimination by Failure to Accommodate 3
We  [*7] address, first, Plaintiff's cause of action for violation of the ADA through the failure to accommodate, included in Count II of the Amended Complaint. 4 Plaintiff claims that he was the subject of a discriminatory failure to accommodate his actual or perceived disability. Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot maintain a cause of action under the ADA because Plaintiff was not disabled within the meaning of the statute. In contrast, Plaintiff argues that he need not actually be disabled, but is entitled to relief under the statute if he was regarded as disabled.
In order to state a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish that (1) he is disabled as defined by the ADA, (2) is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation by the employer, and (3) has suffered an otherwise adverse employment decision as a result of discrimination.  [*8] Spencer v. Verizon Connected Solutions, Inc., 138 Fed. App'x 449, 450 (3d Cir. 2005). Adverse employment decisions include refusing to make reasonable accommodations for a plaintiff's disabilities. Aubrey v. City of Bethlehem, 466 Fed. Appx. 88, 2012 WL 699057, at *4 (3d Cir. 2012)(citing Colwell v. Rite Aid Corp., 602 F.3d 495, 504 (3d Cir. 2010)). In the instant case, the Plaintiff appears to plead that Defendant failed to provide accommodations for Plaintiff.
We address first Plaintiff's argument that even if Plaintiff is not disabled, he was "regarded as" disabled, within the meaning of the statute, and was thus entitled to accommodations.
Although the term disability can mean "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual," 42 U.S.C. 12102(1)(A), it also includes within its definition an individual who is "regarded as having an impairment." 42 U.S.C. 12102(1)(B). An individual is "regarded as" having an impairment when "the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under [the ADA] because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or  [*9] is perceived to limit a major life activity." 42 U.S.C. 12102 (3)(A). However, the "regarded as" prong does not apply to "impairments that are transitory and minor," where transitory impairments are defined as impairments with an actual or perceived duration of 6 months or less. 42 U.S.C. 12102 (3)(B).
Under the ADA, a person is "regarded as" having a disability if he or she (1) has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by the covered entity as constituting such a limitation, (2) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward the impairment, or (3) has no such impairment but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment. Eshelman v. Agere Sys., Inc., 554 F.3d 426, 434 (3d Cir. 2009). To demonstrate that an employer regarded an employee has having a qualifying disability, the plaintiff must demonstrate that "the employer believed that a wholly unimpaired plaintiff had an impairment that substantially limited at least one major life activity or that the employer believed an employee's actual impairment to  [*10] limit major life activities when it in fact did not." Macfarlan v. Ivy Hill SNF, LLC, 675 F.3d 266, 274 (3d Cir. 2012).
In his complaint, Plaintiff appears to contend that Plaintiff was regarded as being so impaired. (Id.) However, to the extent that Plaintiff seeks to pursue a claim for failure to accommodate based on his allegations that he was "regarded as" disabled, he cannot do so. A covered entity need not provide reasonable accommodation or a reasonable modification to policies, practices, or procedures to an individual who meets the definition of disability in § 12102(1) solely under the "regarded as" prong of the section. 42 U.S.C. § 12201(h); see also Hohider v. United States Parcel Serv., 574 F.3d 169, 188 n. 17 (3d Cir. 2009). Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff seeks to pursue a cause of action for failure to accommodate, he may only do so if he actually possessed a disability under § 12102.
We turn, then, to Plaintiff's claim based upon an actual disability. Plaintiff alleges that he suffers from a medical condition that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities, (see Amended Compl. at ¶ 50). Plaintiff further alleges that he has injuries to both hips  [*11] and an injury to his wrist, and he further contends that Defendant was aware of limitations on his ability to lift. In particular, the complaint states that Plaintiff was permitted to lift a maximum of 20 pounds and to push or pull a maximum of 48 pounds. (See Amended Compl. at ¶ 18.) The ADA was amended in 2008 to include lifting as a major life activity. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102 (2)(A). Prior to this amendment, EEOC regulations indicated that lifting was a major life activity. See Marinelli v. City of Erie, Pa., 216 F.3d 354, 363 (3d Cir. 2000). However, there exists contradictory authority regarding when lifting can be considered a major life activity.
Prior to the amendment, the inquiry that the Third Circuit engaged in order to discern whether an injury that inhibited the ability to lift was one that was considered to limit major life activity, was to ask whether the injury substantially limited an injured person's ability to lift. See id. The Third Circuit has previously held that a limitation that restricts lifting to a ten-pound limitation is not one that renders an individual sufficiently different from the general population such that he is substantially limited in his ability  [*12] to lift. Id.; see also Lander v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., 459 Fed. App'x 89 (3d Cir. 2012)(applying ADA law, and not allowing for retroactive application of the ADAAA), Cella v. Villanova University, 113 Fed. App'x 454, 455 (3d Cir. 2004)(ten pound weight restriction does not substantially limit major life activity). Alternatively, the appendix to 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2, "Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities," provides that "if an individual has a back impairment that results in a 20-pound lifting restriction that lasts for several months, he is substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting." 56 FR 35734, July 26, 1991, as amended at 65 FR 36327, June 8, 2000; 76 FR 17003, Mar. 25, 2011.
The apparent conflict between the two authorities is resolved because every case in which the Third Circuit applied the ten-pound limitation applied the law of the ADA, and did not resort to the ADA Amendments Act ("ADAAA"). 5 In contrast, the Interpretive Guidance was issued in 2011, in order to interpret the language of the ADAAA. The Interpretive Guidance is consistent with the new regulations that govern the ADA pursuant to the Amendments Act, which now provide,  [*13] "the term 'major' shall not be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for disability." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2 (i)(2). 6 Given that the instant case is governed by the ADAAA, the interpretive guidance governs this Court's inquiry, and Plaintiff has at least plead sufficient factual information to allege a substantial limitation on the major life activity of lifting.
Additionally, one must consider whether working constitutes a major life activity subject to substantial impairment under the allegations. 42 U.S.C. § 12102 defines a major life activity to include "working." Although the parameters of Plaintiff's limitations on working are not clear, Plaintiff has plead sufficient facts to at least raise the issue of a limitation on his ability to work.
Defendant further contends that Plaintiff requested no accommodations for his disability. The operative regulations provide that once a qualified employee has requested provision of a reasonable accommodation, "[t]o determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2 (o)(3). While it is true that "failure to engage in an  [*15] interactive, good faith process to determine if an accommodation for a disabled employee can be made amounts to prohibited discrimination," Jackson v. J. Lewis Crozer Library, 445 Fed. App'x 533, 536 (3d Cir. 2011), to establish that the employer breached this good faith duty, an employee must show that he "requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability." Id. (citing Colwell, 602 F.3d at 504).
While a plaintiff does not have the burden of requesting a specific reasonable accommodation, he does have to show that he requested an accommodation. See Armstrong v. Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hosp., 438 F.3d 240, 248 (3d Cir. 2006). In order to give notice to an employer of a need for accommodation, no magic words are necessary. Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 f.3d 296, 313 (3d Cir. 1999). The notice must, however, "make clear that the employee wants assistance for his or her disability. Id. The employer must know of the disability and the employee's desire for accommodations for that disability. Id.
In the instant complaint, although Plaintiff alleges facts suggesting that he took three tests in order to find a different position, nowhere does Plaintiff make clear that  [*16] he himself requested an accommodation. In his complaint, however, Plaintiff avers that before his termination, he submitted a doctor's note that "requested light duty accommodations after his injury." (Amended Compl. at ¶ 43.) Despite the request, Plaintiff avers that the defendant "then denied this and did not engage in a meaningful interactive process that would have facilitated the Plaintiff's return to work." (Id.)
The question, then, is whether Plaintiff's submission of a doctor's note suffices as a request for accommodations. This Court's survey of the case law reveals one case within this district dealing with the use of a doctor's note to request accommodations. In that case, the plaintiff submitted a doctor's note merely stating that the plaintiff had been under doctor's care and the date upon which she would be able to return to work. In analyzing the issue before it, the court noted that the note "[did] not make any mention of discrimination or even suggest that Plaintiff suffered from a disability." Kaniuka v. Good Shepherd Home, No. 05-2917, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57403, 2006 WL 2380387, at *9 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 15, 2006). Without the note before it, or any further substance regarding what was contained  [*17] therein, the Court cannot at this juncture determine whether or not it constituted a request for accommodations. Nor is such an inquiry the appropriate grounds for dismissal in a motion to dismiss, as factual discovery shall reveal the nature of the request.
Finally, although the complaint does not note the date of the doctor's note, Plaintiff pleads sufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss. Plaintiff alleges that, through the doctor's note, he made a request for accommodations, and that Defendant refused to engage in an "interactive process" that would have facilitated the plaintiff's return to work. (Amended Compl. at ¶ 43.) As a result, Plaintiff's claims in Count II and Count III of the complaint cannot be dismissed at this juncture.
IV. Retaliation
Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12203, "No person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203.
In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must  [*18] show (1) protected employee activity, (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity, and (3) a causal connection between the employee's protected activity and the employer's adverse action. Williams v. Philadelphia Housing Authority Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 758 (3d Cir. 2004). A plaintiff may maintain such a claim where the basis for relief is retaliation based upon the request for an accommodation. Id. at 759 (3d Cir. 2004). Defendant avers that Plaintiff does not allege any protected activity falling within the purview of the ADA.
Defendant contends that Plaintiff never formally initiated a request for accommodation, meaning that there was no protected activity within the meaning of the ADA. Indeed, a review of the complaint reveals that the only activity in reporting a violation of the ADA took place after Plaintiff was terminated, in September of 2010. (Amended Compl. at ¶ 38.) However, as noted above, Plaintiff alleges that he submitted a doctor's note that requested light duty accommodations. (Id. at ¶ 43.) With respect to these allegations, Plaintiff appears to refer to its contention that on February 28, 2008, Plaintiff's  [*19] doctor recommended indoor work. (See id. at ¶ 16.) These allegations, taken together, which provide that Plaintiff's doctor recommended indoor work, that Plaintiff requested light duty accommodations ,and that Defendant denied those accommodations, are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. Defendant also contends that Plaintiff has not alleged that any request for accommodations was denied, (see Doc. No. 9-2 at 7), but Plaintiff complaint does, in fact, make such allegations. (See Amended Compl. at ¶ 43.) Therefore, whether or not Plaintiff's doctor's note actually requested light duty accommodations, Plaintiff's allegations raise the right to relief above a speculative level, at least stating a claim for relief.
Defendant further contends that Plaintiff has not alleged that he was able to perform the essential functions of the position that he held. However, the standard requires that the person be qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without accommodations. Blake v. UPMC Passavant Hosp., 394 Fed. App'x 940, 941 (3d Cir. 2010)("The ADA prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals, defined as those able, with or without reasonable accommodation,  [*20] to perform the essential functions of the job."). An employee who is disabled "may establish a prima facie case under the ADA if s/he shows that s/he can perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation and that the employer refused to make such an accommodation." Williams, 380 F.3d at 768. Under the ADA, a reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). Moreover, transfer to another position or another office within a company may constitute a "reasonable accommodation." Lucas v. City of Philadelphia, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61942, 2012 WL 1555430 (E.D. Pa. May 2, 2012)(citing Gile v. United Airlines, Inc., 95 F.3d 492, 498 (7th Cir. 1996)). Here, the Complaint alleges that "Plaintiff was qualified for the position that he held with the Defendant." (Amended Compl. ¶ 5.) Further, Plaintiff has at least alleged that he requested light duty accommodations. Thus, assuming the truth of Plaintiff's allegation that he requested light duty accommodation, and the truth of Plaintiff's allegation that he was qualified for the position that he held, Plaintiff has not failed to plead that he was able to perform the essential functions of the position that  [*21] he held.
Defendant finally contends that it allowed Plaintiff to test for other positions, and thus accommodated him. 7 However, it is not clear from the facts, as alleged, whether Defendant's efforts constituted reasonable accommodations. The term reasonable accommodations includes "the employer's reasonable efforts to assist the employee and to communicate with the employee in good faith." Colwell, 602 F.3d at 504. Assuming that an employer knew of the employee's disability and that the employee requested accommodations or assistance, an employee may prevail by showing that the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations and the employee could have been reasonably accommodated. See id. In other words, once proper notice has been provided to an employer of a disability, "both parties have a duty to assist in the search for an appropriate reasonable accommodation and to act in good faith." Id. at 507. Thus, establishing only that Plaintiff was allowed to test for three positions during the course of three years does not establish that Defendant engaged in good faith efforts to accommodate or that Plaintiff could not be reasonably accommodated,  [*22] when no further information has been provided.
While factual discovery may later reveals that Plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of his position, even with any reasonable accommodation, or that Defendant did indeed engage in good faith efforts to accommodate, based on Plaintiff's pleadings alone, he has stated sufficient facts to support a claim for retaliatory discharge.
V. Due Process
Plaintiff finally asserts a claim for a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on the basis of a denial of procedural due process. Defendant contends that the existence of an adequate grievance procedure precludes a due process challenge. In opposition, Plaintiff claims that  [*23] the union refused to file a grievance on Plaintiff's behalf, meaning that Plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity to grieve his claims.
It is true that "where an adequate grievance/arbitration procedure is in place and is followed, a plaintiff has received the due process to which he is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment." Dykes v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Authority, 68 F. 3d 1564, 1565 (3d Cir. 1995). Moreover, "[w]here a due process claim is raised against a public employer, and grievance and arbitration procedures are in place . . . those procedures satisfy due process requirements 'even if the hearing conducted by the Employer . . . [was] inherently biased.'" Id. at 1571 (quoting Jackson v. Temple University, 721 F.2d 931 (3d Cir. 1983)).
Plaintiff can pursue no cause of action against its own employer for a violation of procedural due process for the failure of its union to file a grievance, and the proper course of action is to pursue a cause of action under state law against the union. See Dykes, 68 F.3d at 1571- 72 (3d Cir. 1995); see also Jackson, 721 F.2d at 933 (agreeing with the district court's conclusion that because the plaintiff "did not allege that the  [*24] Employer was 'in any way involved in the Union's decision not to proceed to arbitration,'" the employer had not denied plaintiff a property interest in his job without due process of law).
While Plaintiff contends that the union failed to file his grievance, Plaintiff has not pursued a cause of action against the Union. Once an employee establishes that a union has acted in bad faith towards him or her, the proper course of action is to proceed to the Court of Common pleas under an action for breach of the union's duty of fair representation. See Ziccardi v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 500 Pa. 326, 456 A.2d 979, 981 (Pa. 1982). Where, as here, there are no allegations of collusion by the employer, he would not be properly joined in such a suit. See id. at 982.
Plaintiff argues that federal rather than state law governs the question of whether procedural due process was violated. The more precise way of phrasing this principle of law is that the determination of whether the procedure in place meets due process is a question of federal law regarding due process requirements. That is, the question is whether the grievance procedure in place, in concert with the state law in place to enforce it, are  [*25] sufficient to satisfy the strictures of federal due process. Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985).
Thus, the inquiry is whether the grievance procedure suffices to satisfy the strictures of federal due process, which requires consideration of (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action, (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of any additional or substitute procedural safeguards, and (3) the government's interest, including the function involved and fiscal and administrative burdens of additional procedures. Dykes, 68 F.3d at 1572 (citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 336, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976)). In performing this balancing test, the Third Circuit has found that grievance procedures do not involve a large risk of erroneous deprivation, and while a union may not take up an employee's claim, a failure to do so is done under a duty of fair representation. Dykes, 68 F.3d at 1572. In addition, strong public and private interest exists in maintaining an effective grievance/arbitration procedure to settle employer-employee disputes. Id.
Here, although there are some dissimilarities  [*26] in the extent to which the union pursued the grievance claims in the instant case as opposed to in Dykes, it is still the case that Plaintiff had resort to state law in order to enforce any failure of the union to pursue its obligations. Thus, as in Dykes, here although Plaintiff possesses an interest in his job, the risk of erroneous deprivation remains low, while the addition of procedural safeguards adds little to the present process. Therefore, Plaintiff's claim on the basis of a violation of § 1983 is dismissed.
VI. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 9) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.
