Opinion



NON-FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiff Rosonda Brown1 filed the above-captioned action on November 6, 2020. Plaintiff alleges that Delta Air Lines, Inc., ("Delta"), her former employer, failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability, discriminated against her because of her disability, and retaliated against her for requesting an accommodation for her disability by terminating her employment, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.
The action is now before the Court on the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Cause of Action [8] ("Motion to Dismiss"). For the reasons set forth below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [8] be GRANTED, but that Plaintiff be granted leave to amend the Complaint within twenty-one (21) days of any order adopting this Report and Recommendation.

I. BACKGROUND
On November 6, 2020, Plaintiff filed a "Complaint for Damages" ("Complaint") initiating this action against Defendant Delta. See Compl. [1] at 1. The following facts are [*2]  taken from the Complaint, and, unless otherwise noted, the Court assumes these facts to be true in its discussion of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [8].
Plaintiff alleges in the Complaint that, at all relevant times, Defendant has continuously been an employer engaged in an industry affecting commerce and has had more than fifteen full-time employees. Compl. [1] at ¶ 9. Thus, Plaintiff alleges, Defendant is an employer subject to the ADA. Id. Plaintiff began working for Defendant in or about 2011 as a Cargo Customer Service Agent. Id. at ¶ 13. In 2016, Plaintiff transferred into a Ramp Agent position at Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta. Id. at ¶ 14.
Plaintiff has a disability and/or perceived disability. Id. at ¶ 15. Specifically, while at work in the summer of 2016, Plaintiff injured her back, neck and shoulder which resulted in substantial limitations to one or more of her major life activities. Id. at ¶ 16. As a result, Plaintiff was out of work on long-term disability for approximately one year and returned to work as a Ramp Agent in the summer of 2017. Id. at ¶ 17.
While at work on or about August 8, 2017, Plaintiff began experiencing extreme pain in her back and notified the [*3]  acting Lead, Mr. Fenius, that her back was bothering her. Id. at ¶¶ 18-19. Plaintiff was sent home and advised to see a doctor. Id. at ¶ 20. Plaintiff sought treatment from a medical provider, who released her to return to work with 35-pound lifting restriction. Id. at ¶ 21. When Plaintiff returned to work on August 17, 2017, she notified her Department Manager, Alicia Kirby, of the 35-pound lifting restriction. Id. at ¶ 22. Ms. Kirby informed Plaintiff that she could not work as a Ramp Agent under that restriction and referred Plaintiff to Defendant's job accommodation program. Id. at ¶ 23.
Plaintiff began applying for other positions with Delta that would not require her to have to lift more than 35 pounds and she also applied for long-term disability ("LTD") benefits through Defendant's third-party benefits provider, Sedgwick. Id. at ¶¶ 24-25. In May of 2018, Plaintiff was notified that her LTD claim was denied since she could return to work with an accommodation. Id. at ¶ 26. Plaintiff contacted Human Resources and was again put in touch with Annelyse Sanders with the accommodation program. Id. at ¶ 27. Plaintiff completed the Alternative Position Assistance documentation provided [*4]  to her by Ms. Sanders and from June through August of 2018, Plaintiff worked with Ms. Sanders in identifying and applying for positions in which the lifting accommodation would not be necessary. Id. at ¶ 28-29.
On August 10, 2018, Ms. Sanders sent an email to Plaintiff confirming receipt of the documentation from her physician and stating that she had been released to return to work with following restrictions: no lifting over 100 lbs. occasional; 50 lbs. frequently; 34 lbs. continuously. Id. at ¶ 30. Ms. Sanders advised Plaintiff that, because those restrictions did not prevent Plaintiff from performing the essential duties of a Ramp Agent at Hartfield-Jackson, the accommodation claim was being closed. Id. at ¶ 31. Ms. Sanders directed Plaintiff to consult with A27 to coordinate returning to work. Id. at ¶ 32.
On or about August 15, 2018, Plaintiff obtained a note from her medical provider clarifying the lift, push, pull weight limit to be up to 50 lbs. Id. at ¶ 33. On August 25, 2018, Plaintiff was told that Defendant had not received the note from her doctor releasing her to return and she provided her copy to "Delta employee Barron" to photocopy. Id. at ¶ 34. When Plaintiff returned [*5]  to work on August 27, 2018, she was asked by the "Lead in E Concourse" if she had any restrictions. Id. at ¶ 35. When Plaintiff responded that she did have a 50-pound lifting restriction, she was sent to the management offices. Id. at ¶ 36. Although Plaintiff was told that Defendant did not have record of her doctor's release, the "misplaced note" was found and Plaintiff was sent home. Id. at ¶ 37.
Approximately thirty minutes after being sent home, Plaintiff received a call from Khia Jones with Human Resources, who asked Plaintiff what the doctor's note said, to which Plaintiff responded that she could not lift over 50 pounds. Id. at ¶¶ 38-39. When Ms. Jones claimed that Plaintiff could still work without an accommodation, Plaintiff reminded her that Ms. Jones had previously stated that all employees working the ramp had to be able to lift up to 70 pounds. Id. at ¶ 40. Ms. Jones responded that Plaintiff was on unapproved leave and that no one else from Delta would be contacting her. Id. at ¶ 41.
Following the phone call with Ms. Jones, Plaintiff attempted to contact Ms. Sanders with the job accommodation program, but Ms. Sanders never responded to Plaintiff's calls or emails. Id. at [*6]  ¶¶ 42-43. Plaintiff also tried contacting Sedgwick but did not receive a response. Id. at ¶ 44. Plaintiff continued applying for positions with Delta and communicated with the hiring manager on multiple occasions in an effort to return to work. Id. at ¶ 45. Despite applying to over 30 positions with Delta between September 2017 and January 2020, she was offered only one interview. Id. at ¶ 46. On or about February 5, 2020, Plaintiff attempted to log into "Deltanet," but was unable to access her account. Id. at ¶ 47. After reaching out to Tech Support, she was told that her access had been cut off because she had been terminated. Id. at ¶ 48. Not long after, she was contacted by Delta for her mailing address so that a termination letter could be mailed to her. Id. at ¶ 49.
Plaintiff alleges that she requested a reasonable accommodation of her disabilities; specifically, she requested to be placed in a position in which she was not required to lift over 50 pounds. Id. at ¶ 51. She alleges that Delta failed to engage in the interactive process with Plaintiff, and instead, placed Plaintiff on indefinite leave and eventually terminated her employment. Id. at ¶¶ 52-53. She also alleges that [*7]  Delta terminated her employment because she had a record of a disability or because it regarded her as disabled or because she engaged in protected activity. Id. at ¶ 54.
On or about December 11, 2018, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination against Defendant with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC)." Id. at ¶ 10. Plaintiff alleges that the EEOC issued her a Notice of Right to Sue on her Charge of Discrimination on August 10, 2020, and she filed this action on November 6, 2020, within ninety days of her receipt of that Notice. Id. at ¶¶ 11-12.
On December 29, 2020, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss [8], requesting dismissal of Plaintiff's claims for failure to state a claim for relief, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff filed a response [12] on January 26, 2021, and Defendant filed a reply [16] in support of its Motion on February 5, 2021.

II. DISCUSSION
A. Standard on a Motion to Dismiss
Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a complaint need only contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief," in order to "give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957)). A plaintiff, however, may not merely [*8]  plead facts in a complaint sufficient to find a claim to relief is conceivable; instead, the complaint must set forth "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. at 570.
Defendant has moved to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for failure to state a claim for relief, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). When evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court cannot consider matters outside of the pleadings, and must accept the allegations of the non-movant's pleadings as true, but "[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Moreover, "a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted).
Iqbal went on to instruct that, while a court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true, it need not accept as true legal conclusions recited in a complaint. Repeating that "only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss" the Supreme Court advised that [*9]  "[d]etermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. But when the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not 'shown'—'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)) (other citations omitted).
As noted, a court ordinarily cannot consider matters outside the pleadings when evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), but when a plaintiff has referred to documents in the complaint and such documents are central to the plaintiff's claims, a court may consider those documents as part of the pleadings in the case and may consider them in resolving a Motion to Dismiss. See Brooks v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., 116 F.3d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir. 1997) ("where the plaintiff refers to certain documents in the complaint and those documents are central to the plaintiff's claim, then the court may consider the documents part of the pleadings for the purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal").
Furthermore, it is well-settled law in the Eleventh Circuit that when a plaintiff refers to exhibits to a complaint and the exhibits contradict the allegations of the [*10]  complaint, the exhibits control. See Griffin Indus., Inc. v. Irvin, 496 F.3d 1189, 1205-06 (11th Cir. 2007).
Our duty to accept the facts in the complaint as true does not require us to ignore specific factual details of the pleading in favor of general or conclusory allegations. Indeed, when the exhibits contradict the general and conclusory allegations of the pleading, the exhibits govern.
Id.; see also Associated Builders, Inc. v. Ala. Power Co., 505 F.2d 97, 100 (5th Cir. 1974) ("Conclusory allegations and unwarranted deductions of fact are not admitted as true, especially when such conclusions are contradicted by facts disclosed by a document appended to the complaint. If the appended document, to be treated as part of the complaint for all purposes under Rule 10(c), Fed.R.Civ.P., reveals facts which foreclose recovery as a matter of law, dismissal is appropriate." (citation omitted));2 Simmons v. Peavy-Welsh Lumber Co., 113 F.2d 812, 813 (5th Cir. 1940) ("Where there is a conflict between allegations in a pleading and exhibits thereto, it is well settled that the exhibits control.").
In addition, when a court is considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), documents attached to the motion to dismiss may be considered if the document is both central to the plaintiff's claim and its contents are undisputed. Horsley v. Feldt, 304 F.3d 1125, 1134 (11th Cir. 2002); Day v. Taylor, 400 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Chesnut v. Ethan Allen Retail, Inc., 971 F. Supp.2d 1223, 1228-29 (N.D.Ga. 2013) (considering EEOC document without converting motion to dismiss to motion for summary judgment, stating [*11]  "a document central to the complaint that the defense appends to its motion to dismiss is also properly considered, provided that its contents are not in dispute"). "'Undisputed' means that the authenticity of the document is not challenged." Day, 400 F.3d at 1276.
In this case, Defendant has attached exhibits to its Motion to Dismiss that it contends are both referenced in Plaintiff's Complaint and central to Plaintiff's claims. See Def. Mot. [8], Ex. A-C. Specifically, Defendant has attached, as Exhibit A, a copy of the email sent from Annelyse Sanders to Plaintiff dated August 10, 2018, confirming receipt of documentation from Plaintiff's physician. See Def. Ex. A [8-2] ("August 10 Email"). Defendant has also attached, as Exhibit B, a fax dated August 9, 2018, sent to Ms. Sanders from Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Alicia Iglesias, regarding Plaintiff's physical restrictions on lifting. See Def. Ex. B [8-3] ("August 9 Fax"). Finally, Defendant has attached, as Exhibit C, a "Certificate Return to Work/School" from Dr. Iglesias dated August 15, 2018, in which she states that Plaintiff can return to work on August 16, 2018 "with lift, push, pull weight limit of up to 50 lbs. repetitive duty." See Def. Ex. C [*12]  [8-4] ("August 15 Certificate").
In her response brief, Plaintiff has not disputed the authenticity of any of the exhibits submitted by Defendant in connection with its Motion to Dismiss. See Pl. Br. [12]. Furthermore, it appears that all of these documents are referenced in Plaintiff's Complaint and are central to her claims. See Compl. [1] at ¶¶ 30-33. Accordingly, the Court may consider these documents as part of the pleadings in this case and may consider them in resolving Defendant's Motion to Dismiss without converting it to a motion for summary judgment.
B. Plaintiff's Claims
In the Complaint, Plaintiff asserts three counts of disability discrimination under the ADA. In Count I, Plaintiff claims that Defendant discriminated against her because of her disability or perceived disability when it terminated her employment, in violation of the ADA. Compl. at ¶¶ 55-74. In Count II, Plaintiff claims that Defendant discriminated against her because of her disability when it failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability, in violation of the ADA. Id. at ¶¶ 75-91. Finally, in Count III, Plaintiff claims that Defendant violated the ADA when it terminated her employment in [*13]  retaliation against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Id. at ¶¶ 92-107. Defendant has moved to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for failure to state a claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6).
1. Standards of Proof under the ADA
The ADA was enacted "to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities" and "to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101(b)(1), (b)(2). Title I of the ADA, which covers disability discrimination in employment, prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001). This section of the ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (Carnes, J.) (quoting Harding v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F.Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)).
The definition of "discriminate" [*14]  includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of that individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity").
In general, the burden of proof for a claim of disability discrimination under the ADA is based on the framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), for employment discrimination cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq. See Durley v. APAC, Inc., 236 F.3d 651, 657 (11th Cir. 2000) (McDonnell Douglas framework generally applies to disability discrimination claims under the ADA); see also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 50 n.3, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003) (reviewing disparate treatment disability claim under McDonnell Douglas framework and noting that courts of appeals use this framework in disparate treatment ADA cases); Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007), Bennett v. Dominguez, 196 F. App'x 785, 791 (11th Cir. 2006).
Under this framework, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, a plaintiff may establish a claim under the ADA by first presenting a prima facie case through circumstantial [*15]  evidence of discrimination under the same burden-shifting analysis used in Title VII employment discrimination cases. Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1242; see also Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999). If a plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of a disability, the burden would shift to the defendant to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action, such as termination. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004).
If, however, the employer successfully articulates a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the action, the plaintiff must then establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a discriminatory intent motivated the employer's action. Roberts v. Gadsden Mem'l Hosp., 835 F.2d 793, 796 (11th Cir.), opinion amended on reh'g, 850 F.2d 1549 (11th Cir. 1988) (citing McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; Perryman v. Johnson Products Co., 698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir. 1983)). A plaintiff may carry this burden either indirectly, by showing that the defendant's proffered explanation is pretextual, or directly, by showing that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the defendant's action. Id. (citing Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256; Perryman, 698 F.2d at 1142). "By successfully meeting this burden, the plaintiff creates a presumption that the adverse employment action was the product of discriminatory intent." Id.
For those cases in which an employee claims that an employer violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability, [*16]  however, the Eleventh Circuit has held, albeit in an unpublished decision, that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting framework does not apply because a plaintiff is not required to prove intentional discrimination in those cases. See Nadler, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *9 ("An employer must reasonably accommodate an otherwise qualified employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship in the operation of the business. . . . Thus, applying McDonnell Douglas to reasonable accommodation cases would be superfluous, since there is no need to prove discriminatory motivation.") (emphasis in original); see also Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (in an ADA failure to accommodate case, there are no additional burdens on defendant to show that it had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff or on plaintiff to establish that defendant's proffered reasons were pretextual); Jones v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, No. 1:07-cv-1228, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22142, 2008 WL 779326, *6 (N.D.Ga. March 18, 2008) (Vining, J.) ("The Eleventh Circuit came to the logical conclusion that the McDonnell Douglas test does not apply to reasonable accommodation claims").3
2. Count II - Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation
As noted above, Plaintiff asserts three [*17]  counts in the Complaint, all arising under the ADA. In Count II, Plaintiff claims that Defendant discriminated against her because of her disability when it failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Id. at ¶¶ 75-91. Although Plaintiff has asserted this claim as her second count, the Court will address this claim first because Plaintiff's primary basis of all of her claims is that Defendant failed to provide her a reasonable accommodation for her alleged disability.
The Supreme Court has held that a complaint in an employment discrimination case need not contain specific facts establishing a prima facie case under the evidentiary framework for such cases to survive a motion to dismiss. See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 510-11, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). The Supreme Court has "rejected the argument that a Title VII complaint requires greater 'particularity,' because this would "too narrowly constric[t] the role of the pleadings.'" Id. (quoting McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 283, 96 S. Ct. 2574, 49 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1976)). Therefore, the "Federal Rules do not contain a heightened pleading standard for employment discrimination suits" and "an employment discrimination plaintiff need not plead a prima facie case of discrimination" to survive a motion to dismiss. Id. at 515.
Nevertheless, for claims of employment [*18]  discrimination brought under Title VII, a complaint must still provide sufficient factual allegations to suggest intentional discrimination. See Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., 516 F.3d 955, 974 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). The Eleventh Circuit has held that complaints alleging discrimination still must meet the "plausibility standard" of Twombly and Iqbal. See Edwards v. Prime, Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1300 (11th Cir. 2010) (noting that to state a hostile work environment claim post-Iqbal, employee "was required to allege" the prima facie elements and finding that plaintiff's hostile work environment claim was speculative because complaint stated, without more, that plaintiff was Caucasian and harassing coworkers were Hispanic or Latino); see also Henderson v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 436 F. App'x. 935, 937 (11th Cir. 2011) ("A complaint in an employment discrimination case need not contain specific facts establishing a prima facie case under the evidentiary framework for such cases to survive a motion to dismiss. But complaints alleging discrimination must still meet the 'plausibility standard' of Twombly and Iqbal.") (citations omitted).
Although Plaintiff in this case has brought a claim of disability discrimination under the ADA rather than a claim of race or sex discrimination under Title VII, the standards for stating a claim are similar. Plaintiff must allege at least [*19]  sufficient non-conclusory factual matter to support the elements of her claims, although she is not required to include specific detailed facts establishing each and every element of a prima facie case. While not necessarily the exclusive means of establish such claims, it is useful for guidance purposes to note the basic elements of a prima facie case for disability discrimination under the ADA. See Craft v. Fairfax County Government, No. 1:16CV86(JCC/MSN), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55617, 2016 WL 1643433, at *4 (E.D. Va. Apr. 26, 2016) ("Plaintiff need not plead facts sufficient to constitute a prima facie case under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, but courts may look to the requirements of a prima facie case as a guide in assessing the plausibility of plaintiff's claim for relief.") (internal citations omitted).
In order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must generally demonstrate that: (1) she has a disability as defined in the ADA; (2) she is a "qualified individual," meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, she can perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007); Rossbach v. City of Miami, 371 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (11th Cir. 2004); Witter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998).
Similarly, to prevail on a claim of disability discrimination based on an alleged [*20]  failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she: (1) has a disability under the ADA; (2) was a "qualified individual" when she suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation that would allow her to keep working. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996). In addition, for any claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must also establish that her employer had actual knowledge of her alleged disability or regarded her as disabled. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assoc., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910-911 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky, 80 F.3d at 447-48.
The first prima facie element requires the plaintiff to show that she has a disability as it is defined under the ADA. The ADA defines "disability" as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities . . . ; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C). Thus, a person has a "disability" under the ADA if the person has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment by an employer. See Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)). In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") amended the ADA in 2008 to further provide that, for the purpose of [*21]  establishing the existence of a "disability," "a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B).4
The second element of the prima facie case requires a plaintiff to establish that she is a "qualified individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA defines the term "qualified individual" as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987); Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 278 (11th Cir. 1994).
Thus, an employee must show that she is able to meet all of a job's essential duties and requirements, despite any disability, in order to establish [*22]  a valid ADA claim. See Southeastern Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
"Courts consider the employer's judgment regarding whether a function is essential, as well as (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the individual to perform the function, (3) the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of individuals who held the job in the past, and (5) the work experience of individuals currently in similar jobs." Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 Fed. Appx. 924, 927-28 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1257-58 (11th Cir. 2007)). If a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of her job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then she is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA. See Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).
The third and final element of a plaintiff's prima facie case requires her to establish that she was discriminated against because of her disability or perceived disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007). One way that an employer may be found [*23]  to have discriminated against a qualified individual with a disability is by failing to provide a "reasonable accommodation" for the employee's disability, unless "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
In this case, Plaintiff alleges in the Complaint that she "has a disability and/or perceived disability." Compl. at ¶ 15. Specifically, she contends that, while she was at work in the summer of 2016, she injured her back, neck and shoulder which resulted in substantial limitations to one or more of her major life activities and caused her to be out of work on long-term disability for approximately one year, although she returned to work in the summer of 2017. Id. at ¶¶ 16-17. She alleges that, after she returned to work on or about August 8, 2017, she began experiencing "extreme pain in her back" and was sent home and advised to see a doctor. Id. at ¶¶ 18-20. She alleges that her physician then released her to return to work with 35-pound lifting restriction, but when she returned to work on August 17, 2017, her Department Manager, Alicia Kirby, informed her that she could not work as a Ramp Agent under that restriction and referred Plaintiff to Defendant's [*24]  job accommodation program. Id. at ¶¶ 21-23. She alleges that, after her physician provided another documentation of her restrictions on August 15, 2018, she returned to work on August 27, 2018, but after claiming that she had "a 50-pound lifting restriction," she was "sent to the management offices," and eventually sent home. Id. at ¶¶ 30-38.
For the purpose of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Defendant does not appear to dispute that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that she is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA. See Def. Br. [8-1] at 12. Defendant argues, however, that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for a failure to accommodate under the ADA because she has failed to allege facts showing that she was denied a reasonable accommodation for her alleged disability. Id.
As noted above, the ADA expressly provides that an employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer does not make "reasonable accommodations" for the employee, unless "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 Fed. Appx. 924, 927 (11th Cir. 2010) ("An employer impermissibly discriminates [*25]  against a qualified individual when the employer does not reasonably accommodate the individual's disability."). A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b).
An employer is not required, however, to provide an employee with "the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F.Supp. 931, 947 (N.D.Ga. 1997)). Furthermore, although the ADA lists types of possible accommodations, the fact that a particular accommodation may be included does not mean that such accommodation is automatically deemed "reasonable" under the statute. See Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998). The accommodation must also be reasonable based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Id.; Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285. "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001). "In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to [*26]  eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job." Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal citation and quotation omitted).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Thus, it is the plaintiff who "bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the employee desires." Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 500 Fed. App'x 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86). Moreover, an employer's "duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999) ("[T]he initial burden of requesting an accommodation is on the employee. Only after the employee has satisfied this burden and the employer fails to provide that accommodation can the employee prevail on a claim that her employer has discriminated against her."); see also Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016).
An employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify his or her limitations and possible accommodations. [*27]  29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). But when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id. at 1367; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 Fed. Appx. 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) ("where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In this case, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's allegations fail to state a plausible claim that Delta ever denied her a request for a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Def. Br. [8-1] at 12-14. In particular, Delta argues, the exhibits it attached to its Motion to Dismiss demonstrate that, contrary to Plaintiff's allegations in her Complaint, Plaintiff's physician informed Delta that she was able to lift more than 50 pounds, and thus, her request to be allowed to work with a 50-pound lifting restriction was not a reasonable one because such [*28]  an accommodation was not necessary for her to perform her job. Id.
As set forth above, the facts alleged in the Complaint that are relevant to the Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation for her disability are as follows.5 Plaintiff alleges that, on August 10, 2018, Annelyse Sanders sent an email to Plaintiff confirming receipt of the documentation from her physician and stating that she had been released to return to work with following restrictions: no lifting over 100 lbs. occasional; 50 lbs. frequently; 34 lbs. continuously. Compl. at ¶ 30. Ms. Sanders advised Plaintiff that, because those restrictions did not prevent Plaintiff from performing the essential duties of a Ramp Agent at Hartfield-Jackson, the accommodation claim was being closed. Id. at ¶ 31.
On or about August 15, 2018, Plaintiff obtained a note from her medical provider clarifying the lift, push, pull weight limit to be up to 50 lbs. Id. at ¶ 33. On August 25, 2018, Plaintiff provided a copy of that note to "Delta employee Barron" to photocopy. Id. at ¶ 34. Plaintiff returned to work on August 27, 2018, and after she told the "Lead in E Concourse" that she had a "50-pound lifting restriction," she was [*29]  sent to the management offices, and eventually sent home. Id. at ¶¶ 35-37.
Approximately thirty minutes after being sent home, Plaintiff received a call from Khia Jones with Human Resources, who asked Plaintiff what the doctor's note said, to which Plaintiff responded that "she could not lift over 50 pounds." Id. at ¶¶ 38-39. After Ms. Jones told Plaintiff that she could still work without an accommodation, Plaintiff said "that Ms. Jones had previously stated that all employees working the ramp had to be able to lift up to 70 pounds." Id. at ¶ 40. Ms. Jones responded that Plaintiff was on unapproved leave. Id. at ¶ 41. Subsequently, Plaintiff applied for other positions at Delta but was unsuccessful, and eventually, on or about February 5, 2020, Plaintiff was informed that Delta had terminated her employment. Id. at ¶¶ 45-49.
Delta argues that, contrary to Plaintiff's allegations, the exhibits demonstrate that Plaintiff did not request a reasonable accommodation for her disability.6 Defendant's Exhibit A, the August 10 Email, is a copy of the email sent from Annelyse Sanders to Plaintiff dated August 10, 2018, confirming receipt of documentation from Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Iglesias. [*30]  See Def. Ex. A [8-2]. In the August 10 Email, Ms. Sanders advised Plaintiff that she had received a fax from Plaintiff's physician the day before, on August 9, indicating that Plaintiff had the following restrictions: "No lifting > 100 lbs. occasional, 50 lbs. frequently, and 34 lbs. continuously." Id. Ms. Sanders further stated that "[t]he above work restrictions do not prevent you from performing the essential functions of your position as a Ramp Agent in department 120 at ATL. As a result, your accommodation claim will be closed." Id.
Defendant's Exhibit B, the August 9 Fax, is a fax sent to Ms. Sanders on August 9, 2018, from Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Alicia Iglesias, regarding Plaintiff's physical restrictions on lifting.7 See Def. Ex. B [8-3]. The August 9 Fax is handwritten and somewhat confusing. On the first page, it states "Last Seen 9/8/17," "documentation has been submitted," "we have nothing more to submit," and "we can not evaluate a patient we haven't seen in over a year." Id. at 1. On the following pages, however, is a "Physician's Certification for Job Accommodation" which states that the Plaintiff was last seen on August 8, 2018, and was signed by Dr. Iglesias on August [*31]  9, 2018. Id. at 4. Dr. Iglesias further states that Plaintiff's impairment was "left shoulder, neck and back pain due to heavy lifting," and that she was "able to lift up to 70 lbs. total to minimal pain," and that "pain is produced due to repetitive heavy lifting (x 50 lbs)." Id. at 3. Under the "Restrictions" section, Dr. Iglesias states that Plaintiff's restriction is "to heavy, repeated lifting, pushing, pulling of more than 60 lbs." Id.
The next page of the August 9 Fax is a form titled "Attending Physician's Statement of Continued Disability," in which Dr. Iglesias states that Plaintiff can lift or carry up to 34 pounds "continuously," or 67-100% of the day; up to 50 pounds "frequently," or 34-66% of the day; and up to 100 pounds "occasionally," or up to 33% of the day. Id. at 5. Dr. Iglesias also states that the Plaintiff would be able to return to work with the above restrictions on August 9, 2018, and when asked "Is the patient able to return to work without restrictions?" Dr. Iglesias checked "yes," stating that the Plaintiff's "full duty start date" was August 9, 2018. Id.
Defendant's Exhibit C, the August 15 Certificate, is a "Certificate Return to Work/School" from Dr. [*32]  Iglesias dated August 15, 2018. See Def. Ex. C [8-4]. That Certificate states that Plaintiff "has been under my care and will be disabled from work/school" on August 15, 2018. Id. It further states that Plaintiff can return to work on August 16, 2018 "with lift, push, pull weight limit of up to 50 lbs. repetitive duty." Id. In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that, on or about August 15, 2018, she "obtained a note from her medical provider clarifying the lift, push, pull weight limit to be up to 50 lbs." Compl. at ¶ 33. Plaintiff makes no mention of Dr. Iglesias's statement that Plaintiff is limited to "up to 50 lbs. repetitive duty." Thus, Defendant argues, because Plaintiff misrepresents the limitations included in the August 15 Certificate in the Complaint, her allegation that her physician stated that she could not lift over 50 pounds should not be considered as true for the purpose of this Motion.8 Def. Br. [8-1] at 6.
Furthermore, Defendant argues, the August 15 Certificate is "fully consistent" with the August 9 Fax that had been sent to Delta only six days earlier, in which Dr. Iglesias stated that Plaintiff could lift up to 34 pounds continuously (up to 66-100% of the day), [*33] 9 up to 50 pounds frequently (up to 34-66% of the day), and up to 100 pounds occasionally (up to 33% of the day). Id. at 7. Because the August 15 Certificate also stated that Plaintiff was able to lift "up to 50 lbs. repetitive duty," Defendant argues that the August 15 Certificate actually "made no change" to Plaintiff's lifting or carrying restrictions that Dr. Iglesias included in the August 9 Fax. Id.
Consequently, Defendant argues, the exhibits demonstrate that Plaintiff misrepresented her actual limitations in the allegations of the Complaint. Plaintiff alleges in the Complaint that, when she returned to work on August 27, 2018, she was asked by the "Lead in E Concourse" if she had any restrictions. Compl. at ¶ 35. When Plaintiff responded that she had a "50-pound lifting restriction," she was sent to the management offices, and eventually sent home. Id. at ¶¶ 36-37. Plaintiff also alleges in the Complaint that she later received a telephone call on that same day from Khia Jones with Human Resources, who asked Plaintiff what the doctor's note said, to which Plaintiff responded that "she could not lift over 50 pounds." Id. at ¶¶ 38-39. Plaintiff claims that Ms. Jones told her [*34]  that she could still work without an accommodation, and Plaintiff "reminded her that Ms. Jones had previously stated that all employees working the ramp had to be able to lift up to 70 pounds." Id. at ¶ 40.
Thus, Defendant argues, the exhibits demonstrate that Plaintiff's repeated statements to her supervisor and Human Resources, as alleged in the Complaint, that her physician restricted her from lifting over 50 pounds was false, because her physician actually stated that she was able to lift up to 50 pounds "frequently," or up to 34-66% of the day, and up to 100 pounds "occasionally," or up to 33% of the day, and she was only restricted from lifting more than 50 pounds on "repetitive duty." Defendant argues that Plaintiff's "assertion of her restrictions is false and is properly disregarded on this motion." Def. Br. at 7.
Defendant argues, therefore, that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts that would plausibly support a claim that Delta denied her a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Id. at 12. According to Defendant, the Plaintiff's allegations, taken together with the documents referenced in the Complaint, "establish that, in August 2018, based on the essential [*35]  functions of her Ramp Agent job and the conclusion from her physician," she was able to return to work in her Ramp Agent job on full duty without restriction. Id. at 12-13. Further, Plaintiff admits that Delta informed her that she was able to perform her job and directed her to return to her Ramp Agent job, but Plaintiff refused. Id. at 13.
As a result, according to Defendant, the factual allegations of the Complaint, taken together with the exhibits reflecting Plaintiff's actual restrictions from her physician, show that, "far from discriminating against [Plaintiff], Delta directed her to return to her work where she would move from an unpaid leave to full pay at Delta." Id. Defendant contends that Plaintiff "apparently lost interest in returning to her Ramp Agent position and instead unsuccessfully sought other positions at Delta," but that "had nothing to do with the ADA or an accommodation process as she was able to return to her Ramp Agent job and no accommodation process was needed." Id. In sum, Defendant contends, there was no "adverse action" that could form the basis of a discrimination claim because Plaintiff did not require any accommodation to return to work based on her [*36]  own allegations and the documents she references to support her claimed limitations. Id. at 13-14.
In response, Plaintiff argues that, despite Defendant's contention that Plaintiff did not require an accommodation, "the facts, as alleged, indicate that there were grounds to provide reasonable accommodations, or at least engage in the interactive process." Pl. Br. [12] at 9. Plaintiff points to her allegation in the Complaint she applied for LTD benefits through Defendant's third-party benefits provider, Sedgwick, but in May of 2018, Plaintiff was notified that her LTD claim was denied because she could return to work with an accommodation. See Compl. at ¶¶ 24-26. But, she argues, Defendant still refused to provide any accommodation to Plaintiff or engage in the interactive process. Pl. Br. at 10. She contends that Defendant "continued to seek medical documentation and doggedly insist that the only option was for Plaintiff to perform her position without an accommodation." Id.
Plaintiff argues further that "Defendant's argument requires the Court to accept its self-serving conclusion that Plaintiff did not require an accommodation in her position." Id. According to Plaintiff, Defendant [*37]  is attempting to rely on her physician as an "expert" on the essential functions of Plaintiff's position, when there is no indication that her physician had any training in vocational assessment, while Sedgwick, the benefits provider, would have analyzed the functional requirements of Plaintiff's job when it determined that her position could be performed "with an accommodation." Id. at 10-11.
Plaintiff argues further that, "it is not settled" as to what the essential functions of the Ramp Agent job were, and "Plaintiff believes the evidence will show that the ability to lift seventy (70) pounds regularly will constitute an essential function of her position." Id. at 12. Plaintiff also claims that "it is not clear what Plaintiff's actual restrictions were, given some crossed communications with her physician." Id. at 12, n.2. She also contends that, although she failed to specify "the exact nature" of her restrictions in the Complaint, she "is willing to amend the complaint to specifically refer to a '50-pound frequent lifting limitation' for the purposes of clarity." Id. at 8. In sum, she argues, the "fact specific analysis required to determine the essential functions of her position [*38]  cannot be simply eschewed in favor of Defendant's self-servicing conclusions, in order to dispose of her entire case." Id. at 12.
The problem with Plaintiff's argument is that the Court must determine whether Plaintiff has stated a plausible claim that Delta denied her request for a reasonable accommodation for her disability based on the factual allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint, along with the facts indicated in the exhibits provided by Defendant which are referenced in the Complaint and central to Plaintiff's claims, namely, the August 9 Fax, the August 10 Email, and the August 15 Certificate. While Dr. Iglesias's statements about Plaintiff's restrictions are somewhat confusing, Plaintiff does not dispute that Dr. Iglesias never reported to Delta that Plaintiff was completely limited from lifting over 50 pounds. Yet in the Complaint, Plaintiff claims that the only accommodation she requested from Delta was the restriction included in her "doctor's note" that she was limited from lifting over 50 pounds. See Compl. at ¶¶ 36, 39, 50-51.
But as noted, the exhibits demonstrate that Plaintiff's physician Dr. Iglesias never stated in any documentation provided to Delta that Plaintiff [*39]  was unable to lift more than 50 pounds. In the August 9 Fax, Dr. Iglesias made multiple statements regarding Plaintiff's limitations, including that Plaintiff's restriction is "to heavy, repeated lifting, pushing, pulling of more than 60 lbs," and also that she can lift or carry up to 50 pounds "frequently," or 34-66% of the day; and up to 100 pounds "occasionally," or up to 33% of the day, although, confusingly, she also said that Plaintiff was able to return to work on August 9, 2018 with "no restrictions." See Def. Ex. B. Just six days later, in the August 15 Certificate, she stated that Plaintiff can return to work on August 16, 2018 "with lift, push, pull weight limit of up to 50 lbs. repetitive duty." Id. (emphasis added). Thus, while the restrictions found by Dr. Iglesias varied somewhat, in none of these opinions did she state that Plaintiff was completely prohibited from lifting more than 50 pounds. Plaintiff claims in the Complaint, however, that she told Delta that her "doctor's note" said that "she could not lift over 50 pounds." Compl. at ¶ 39.
The Court agrees with Plaintiff that the statement by Dr. Iglesias in the August 9 Fax that Plaintiff could return to full duty [*40]  with "no restrictions" is not dispositive on the issue of whether Plaintiff retained the ability to perform the essential functions of the Ramp Agent position. Defendant relies heavily on this statement to argue that even Plaintiff's own physician believed she was able to perform her job with no restrictions, yet Plaintiff refused to return to work because she simply no longer wanted to work at the Ramp Agent job. The Court agrees with Plaintiff that there is nothing in the Complaint or the exhibits that would indicate that Dr. Iglesias has any special knowledge regarding the essential functions of the Ramp Agent position. But similarly, Plaintiff also relies on her allegation that Sedgwick, the third-party benefits provider, told her in May of 2018 that she could return to her job "with an accommodation." Compl. at ¶ 26. Plaintiff does not specify what this purported "accommodation" would be that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her job, nor does she allege that Sedgwick provided any specific information regarding this purported accommodation to Delta.
In a nutshell, therefore, the Complaint alleges that Plaintiff requested that she be allowed to return to her [*41]  Ramp Agent position with a restriction on lifting over 50 pounds, while the "doctor's note" that she claimed to support that request actually stated that Plaintiff could lift up to 50 pounds "frequently," but she could not lift more than 50 pounds on a "continuous" or "repetitive" basis, such as more than 66% of the workday. See Def. Ex. B, C. Plaintiff does not allege that she informed Delta that, regardless of what was in her "doctor's note," she was still unable to lift over 50 pounds. Instead, Plaintiff repeatedly alleges that it was her doctor who stated that she had such a restriction, and she requested an accommodation based on the lifting restrictions found by her doctor. Because the exhibits demonstrate that Plaintiff's allegations regarding the restrictions in her "doctor's note" are not accurate, the Court cannot consider those allegations. Consequently, the Court finds that, Plaintiff's Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Delta denied her a reasonable accommodation.
Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Delta violated the ADA when it denied her request for a reasonable [*42]  accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her Ramp Agent job. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [8] be GRANTED with respect to Count II, Plaintiff's claim that Delta violated the ADA by failing to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability. However, because of the confusion and ambiguities that result from the contradictory statements asserted in the pleadings and attached documents, the Court cannot say as a matter of law that a better pleaded Complaint could not cure the deficiencies and state a claim. As explained further below, the Court recommends that dismissal be granted with LEAVE TO AMEND to allow Plaintiff at least one more chance to better explain this claim.
3. Count I - Disability Discrimination
In Count I of the Complaint, Plaintiff claims that Defendant discriminated against her because of her disability or perceived disability when it terminated her employment, in violation of the ADA. Compl. at ¶¶ 55-74. Plaintiff claims that Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment because of her "disability, perceived disability, or record of having a disability," and that "Defendant terminated [*43]  Plaintiff's employment because of her accommodation requests." Id. at ¶¶ 62-63. She also alleges that "Defendant treated other employees outside Plaintiff's protected class differently." Id. at ¶ 66.
Defendant argues that this claim must be dismissed because Plaintiff "alleges no facts to plausibly assert a claim that Delta terminated her in 2020 because of her disability. Just the opposite." Def. Br. at 14. According to Delta, Plaintiff's allegations in the Complaint indicate that, although Delta informed her that she could return to her Ramp Agent position, she never returned to her job, but although she was on unapproved leave, Delta did not terminate her employment until February of 2020, approximately a year and a half after she allegedly made the request for an accommodation. Defendant argues that there is "no plausible basis to allege that Delta finally terminated her because of her disability, and the only plausible inference from her alleged facts is that she abandoned her job when she neither returned to work in her Ramp Agent job nor provided any medical restriction that supported a claim that she could not do so." Id. at 14-15.
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff "makes [*44]  generic and factually unsupported allegations that Delta also acted based on her record of a disability or a perception of a disability," but according to Defendant, these allegations "are not only implausible but are contradicted by her own factual allegations." Id. at 14 n.6. Defendant again notes that, based on Plaintiff's own allegations in the Complaint, Plaintiff admits that Delta repeatedly offered and indeed directed her to return to her Ramp Agent job, but Plaintiff failed to return to work. Id. Thus, Defendant argues, its actions "are not adverse employment actions but positive actions to allow her to return to her job with full pay." Id. As a result, Defendant contends, the "notion that Delta discriminated against her because she claims she was in the past disabled or that Delta perceived her to be too disabled to return to work is nonsensical in light of the very allegations and documents she relies upon in her Complaint." Id.
In Plaintiff's response brief, it is not entirely clear whether she responds to Defendant's argument regarding the termination of her employment. Although Plaintiff argues that "Defendant Failed in its Duties," she primarily focuses on Delta's alleged [*45]  failure to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability. See Pl. Br. at 6-7. Plaintiff also argues, however, that "Defendant denied Plaintiff the ability to work," and "refused to permit Plaintiff to work." See id. at 1-2, 7-8. She contends that, after she returned to work in 2017, her "Acting Lead (i.e. Delta) sent her home when she had back pain and instructed her to see a doctor." Id. at 7. Further, she contends, after she received treatment from her doctor "it was her supervisor (i.e. Delta) who said she could not return to work with her restrictions."10 Id. She also contends that, after she returned to work on August 27, 2018, "the Acting Lead (i.e. Delta) sent her to the Delta management offices," and after she was sent home, she received a call from Human Resources, "who told her she could not work her position." Id. at 8.
In the Complaint, however, Plaintiff does not allege that Human Resources "told her she could not work in her position." To the contrary, Plaintiff alleges that Delta told her repeatedly that she was able to work in the Ramp Agent position even with the restrictions noted by her doctor. Plaintiff alleges in the Complaint, that, on [*46]  August 10, 2018, Ms. Sanders sent an email to Plaintiff confirming receipt of the documentation from her physician and advising Plaintiff that those restrictions did not prevent Plaintiff from performing the essential duties of a Ramp Agent. Id. at ¶¶ 30-31.
Plaintiff also alleges that, on August 27, 2018, after she had been sent home from work after claiming that she had a 50-pound lifting restriction, she received a call from Khia Jones with Human Resources, who asked Plaintiff what the doctor's note said, to which Plaintiff again responded that she could not lift over 50 pounds. Id. at ¶¶ 38-39. Ms. Jones then told Plaintiff that she could still work without an accommodation, and Plaintiff "reminded her that Ms. Jones had previously stated that all employees working the ramp had to be able to lift up to 70 pounds." Id. at ¶ 40. Ms. Jones responded that Plaintiff was on unapproved leave. Id. at ¶ 41.
Thus, contrary to Plaintiff's argument in her brief that Delta "refused" to permit her to work, and told her that she could not work in her position, her allegations in the Complaint plainly state that Ms. Sanders told her, on August 10, 2018, that her restrictions did not preclude her [*47]  from performing the essential duties of a Ramp Agent, and Ms. Jones told her, on August 27, 2018, that she could still perform her job without an accommodation. Indeed, Plaintiff admits that Ms. Jones told her that she was "unapproved leave." Id. at ¶ 41.
Plaintiff's allegations in the Complaint indicate that Delta repeatedly told her that she was able to perform her job as a Ramp Agent and she could return to work, but she chose to remain on unapproved leave. Further, Plaintiff alleges that, after she was out on unapproved leave for approximately a year and a half, Delta eventually terminated her employment on or about February 5, 2020. Id. at ¶¶ 47-49. These allegations cannot support a plausible claim that Delta terminated her employment because of any disability or perceived disability. Plaintiff also makes the conclusory allegation that "Defendant treated other employees outside Plaintiff's protected class differently." Id. at ¶ 66. But Plaintiff has failed to allege any facts in the Complaint that would conceivably support that claim.
The Court finds, therefore, that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Delta terminated her employment [*48]  because of her disability or perceived disability. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [8] be GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND with respect to Count I, Plaintiff's claim that Delta discriminated against her because of her disability when it terminated her employment.
4. Count III - Retaliation
In Count III of the Complaint, Plaintiff claims that Defendant terminated her employment in retaliation against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Compl. at ¶¶ 92-107. Plaintiff alleges that her "request for an accommodation of her disability and/or perceived disability constitutes protected conduct under the ADA." Id. at ¶ 98. Plaintiff also alleges that "Defendant terminated Plaintiff for requesting an accommodation for her disability and/or perceived disability," and "Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff by terminating her employment on the basis of her request for an accommodation." Id. at ¶¶ 97, 99. Plaintiff contends that "Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment within a close temporal proximity to Plaintiff's accommodation requests." Id. at ¶ 100.
The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual [*49]  because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). The Eleventh Circuit has held that, because this provision creates a prohibition on retaliation under the ADA that is similar to the prohibition on retaliation found in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq., courts should evaluate ADA retaliation claims under the same framework and standards that are applied to claims of retaliation brought under Title VII. Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corr., 500 F. App'x 860, 869 (11th Cir. 2012); McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1075-77 (11th Cir. 1996) (relying on Title VII jurisprudence to interpret meaning of ADA provisions in a retaliation case).
Under that standard, to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, "a plaintiff must show (1) a statutorily protected expression; (2) adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action." Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. The first prima facie element may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016). A plaintiff is not required to show that he or she has an actual disability under the ADA to establish this element, but merely that he or she "had a good faith, objectively reasonable belief [*50]  that he was entitled to [the requested] accommodations under the ADA." Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998). A plaintiff must also show that the decisionmaker was aware of the protected activity, because "[a] decision maker cannot have been motivated to retaliate by something unknown to him." Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000).
Although Plaintiff has labeled her claim in Count I as a claim of "disability discrimination" and her claim in Count III as a claim of "retaliation," the Court notes that Plaintiff's claim in Count III appears to be, at least in part, a repeat of her claim in Count I. In support of her claim in Count I, Plaintiff alleges that "Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment because of her accommodation requests." Id. at ¶ 63. This allegation that Defendant terminated her employment because of her accommodation request also forms the entire basis of her claim in Count III.
In any event, Plaintiff has alleged no facts in the Complaint that would support a plausible claim that Delta's decision to terminate her employment was based on an intent to retaliate against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability. To the contrary, as discussed, Plaintiff alleges that Delta repeatedly told Plaintiff that her restrictions [*51]  from her doctor did not prevent her from working at her Ramp Agent job, and that she was able to perform that job. Plaintiff also admits that Delta told her that she was on "unapproved leave" from her job, but she never returned to work.
Moreover, although Plaintiff makes the conclusory allegation that "Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment within a close temporal proximity to Plaintiff's accommodation requests," the factual allegations of the Complaint do not support that claim. See id. at ¶ 100. Plaintiff alleges that she last reported to work on August 27, 2018, when she claimed that she had a "50-pound lifting restriction," (although as discussed, Plaintiff's doctor actually told Delta that she could lift up to 50 pounds frequently and up to 100 pounds occasionally). Id. at ¶¶ 35-36. After she was sent home that day, Khia Jones with Human Resources called her and told her that she could still work as a Ramp Agent without an accommodation, and also told her that she was on "unapproved leave." Id. at ¶¶ 38-41.
Plaintiff does not allege that she ever notified Delta that she wanted to return to her Ramp Agent position at any time after August 27, 2018, but she alleges that Delta [*52]  did not terminate her employment until on or about February 5, 2020. Id. at ¶¶ 47-49. Thus, Plaintiff's allegations in the Complaint demonstrate that she was out of work on "unapproved leave" for almost a year and a half after she had made her last request for an accommodation for her disability. These allegations do not show a "close temporal proximity" between Plaintiff's request for an accommodation and the termination of her employment, and thus, they cannot support a plausible claim that Delta terminated her employment in retaliation against her for requesting an accommodation.
Plaintiff's claim of retaliation under the ADA also fails because it appears to be a repackaging or duplication of her claim in Count II that Delta failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability. In both claims, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant refused to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability and, instead—almost a year and a half later—terminated her employment. Plaintiff bases both claims on the same facts and she alleges no additional facts that would support a separate and independent claim for retaliation. The Eleventh Circuit has stated that "[w]e have refused to address [*53]  a plaintiff's retaliation claims based on an employer's refusal to accommodate her where the described acts 'relate directly to her 'reasonable accommodation' discrimination claim, not her retaliation claim.'" Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corr., 500 F. App'x 860, 869 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1288 (11th Cir. 1997)); see also Calvo v. Walgreens Corp., 340 F. App'x 618, 626 (11th Cir. 2009) ("[T]he gist of [Plaintiff's] discrimination claim is that [Defendant] refused to accommodate her because of her disability. [Defendant] did not refuse to accommodate [Plaintiff] because she requested accommodation.").
As discussed above, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Delta denied her a reasonable accommodation for her disability. It follows, therefore, that, because Plaintiff's claim of retaliation merely duplicates or re-packages her claim of discrimination based on Delta's alleged failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff has also failed to state a plausible claim that Delta retaliated against her because of her accommodation request when it terminated her employment. See Perez v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., No. 1:12-CV-3161-MHS, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183026, 2013 WL 6970898, at *11 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 19, 2013) (noting that "[t]he acts plaintiff describes in support of his retaliation claim relate to his discrimination and reasonable accommodation claims, not to any retaliation claim").
In sum, the Court [*54]  finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Delta terminated her employment because of an intent to retaliate against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [8] be GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND with respect to Count III, Plaintiff's claim that Delta retaliated against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability when it terminated her employment.
C. Plaintiff's Leave to Amend
In her response brief, Plaintiff states that, although she failed to specify "the exact nature" of her restrictions in the Complaint, "[u]pon reviewing Defendant's motion," she "is willing to amend the complaint to specifically refer to a '50-pound frequent lifting limitation' for the purposes of clarity." Pl. Br. at 8 n.1. Plaintiff, however, has not filed any motion requesting leave to amend the Complaint.
In its reply brief, Defendant argues that the Court should not allow Plaintiff to amend her Complaint and should instead dismiss all of her claims with prejudice. Def. Reply Br. [16] at 12-14. According to Defendant, the Eleventh Circuit has held [*55]  that the court need not permit a plaintiff who is represented by counsel to file an amended complaint after the court grants a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Id. at 13 (citing Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Industries, Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 541-42 (11th Cir. 2002) (holding that, to allow a represented plaintiff to move to amend only after the grant of a motion to dismiss would allow the plaintiff to "sit idly by as he awaited the district court's determination with respect to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss" and thus have "two bites at the apple").
Delta argues that, in this case, allowing Plaintiff to amend her Complaint would be "particularly unwarranted" because "it is now established that her Complaint was premised on a false factual assertion about her restrictions in August 2018 and the indisputably true facts on them would render any amended complaint to be futile." Id. at 14. The Court cannot agree that, merely because Plaintiff's allegations in the Complaint are not entirely consistent with her physician's note provided to Delta regarding her alleged restrictions, that there is no possibility that Plaintiff could amend her Complaint to state a plausible claim against Delta.
For that reason, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff should [*56]  be afforded an opportunity to amend the Complaint before her claims are dismissed with prejudice. Thus, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [8] be GRANTED, but that Plaintiff be granted leave to amend the Complaint within twenty-one (21) days of any order adopting this Report and Recommendation before her claims are dismissed.
D. Order to file Joint Preliminary Report and Discovery Plan
In an Order [14] filed February 3, 2021, the undersigned noted that the Joint Preliminary Report and Discovery Plan ("JPR") had not been timely filed under the Local Rules, and the parties were ordered to file a JPR within fourteen days of the date of that Order. See Order [14] at 1-2; LR 16.2, NDGa. As of this date, that deadline has passed but the parties have failed to comply with that Order, nor has any party filed a motion seeking an extension of time to do so. In light of the Court's recommendation herein that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [8] be granted, however, the Court extends the deadline to file a JPR until thirty (30) days after Defendant files an answer to any amended complaint, in the event that Plaintiff files an amended complaint.

III. RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons [*57]  discussed above, IT IS RECOMMENDED that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [8] be GRANTED, but that Plaintiff be granted leave to amend the Complaint within twenty-one (21) days of any order adopting this Report and Recommendation.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 9th day of March, 2021.
