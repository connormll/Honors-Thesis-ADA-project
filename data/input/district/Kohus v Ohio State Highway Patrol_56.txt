Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, initiated this action by filing a complaint on September 8, 2009 against his employer, the Ohio State Highway Patrol, and related defendants. In subsequent amendments to his complaint, Plaintiff identified thirteen defendants 1 and alleged a total of eleven causes of action, including but not limited to employment discrimination and various violations of his constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. §1983. All Defendants have jointly moved to dismiss Plaintiff's second amended complaint (Doc. 56). Plaintiff has filed a response in opposition (Doc. 97), to which Defendants have filed a reply (Doc. 102). Pursuant to local practice, the motion has been referred to the undersigned for initial consideration and a report and recommendation. 28 U.S.C. §636(b). For the reasons set forth herein, I recommend that the Defendants' motion be granted.

I. Introduction
For  [*3] purposes of Defendants' motion to dismiss, all allegations in Plaintiff's complaint, as amended, have been accepted as true. Below, I first set forth the relevant factual and procedural background. Next, I briefly discuss the applicable standards under Rule 8 and Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Finally, I review the arguments presented by Defendants concerning the eleven separate claims contained in Plaintiff's second amended complaint.

A. Factual Background
The following facts represent this Court's best efforts to parse out allegations contained in Plaintiff's second amended complaint that are most relevant to Plaintiff's claims and Defendants' pending motion.
Plaintiff alleges that he was first commissioned as a Trooper with the Ohio State Highway Patrol ("OSHP") on October 27, 2006, and assigned to the Wilmington, Ohio Outpost. (Doc. 55, ¶50). Plaintiff alleges that at some point thereafter, the OSHP unilaterally and unlawfully changed Plaintiff's "appointment" date from October 27, 2006 to November 13, 2006. (Id. at ¶¶33-34). Plaintiff argues that the appointment date is relevant for purposes of seniority as well as for purposes of the calculation of Plaintiff's  [*4] one-year probationary period. After joining the OSHP, Plaintiff also joined the Ohio State Troopers Association ("OSTA"), a labor union representing OSHP troopers. (Id. at ¶2).
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have violated his constitutional rights and have discriminated against him in multiple ways since he first became employed with the OSHP. Pertinent to some of Plaintiff's discrimination claims is his allegation that he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ("ADHD"). (Id. at ¶47).
Plaintiff alleges that on multiple occasions, Defendants Sgt. New and/or Lt. Lee "intimidated and prevented him" from claiming overtime, thereby depriving him of his rights under the Collective Bargaining Agreement ("CBA") and/or 29 U.S.C. §201, et seq. (Id. at ¶46).
Plaintiff alleges that he was poisoned on May 2, 2007 at the Wilmington Patrol Post when an unknown person placed an unidentified toxic chemical on or in his patrol car. (Id. at ¶¶52-55). Plaintiff alleges that on "information and belief...Defendant Sgt. New was the perpetrator," although the OSHP never investigated the allegedly "criminal assault." (Id. at ¶¶56-57). Plaintiff alleges that he dropped a workers' compensation  [*5] injury claim arising out of the incident only after being "intimidated" into doing so. (Id. at ¶¶58-59). Plaintiff alleges that during a subsequent investigation of his supervisor's "illegal order" for Plaintiff to "drop" the workers' compensation claim, the investigator (Defendant Sgt. Miller) engaged in a "cover-up" that included false and deceptive witness statements. (Id. at ¶¶60-65).
On August 25, 2007, while on duty driving an OSHP patrol car, Plaintiff was involved in a car accident. (Id. at ¶68). Plaintiff alleges that he unintentionally ran over a chair that was in the roadway; however, his supervisors believed that this explanation was false. Several of the individual Defendants initiated an administrative investigation against Plaintiff regarding the accident. (Id. at ¶¶77-79). On September 7, 2007, Defendant Sergeant Crisafi questioned Plaintiff in an office for two hours regarding the investigation. (Id. at ¶87). Plaintiff complains that he was not permitted a lawyer or union representative, and was not given a "Miranda warning" prior to being questioned. (Id. at ¶89). He argues that Defendants' investigation was a "sham" and conducted "in reckless disregard of the truth"  [*6] and in violation of Plaintiff's constitutional rights. (Id. at ¶¶80-81).
Defendants subsequently asked Plaintiff to submit to a polygraph examination concerning the accident, which Plaintiff refused. (Id. at ¶90). Plaintiff alleges that taking a polygraph test is contrary to his Roman Catholic religion. (Id. at ¶95). Plaintiff was subsequently accused of filing a false police report and tampering with evidence. (Id. at ¶101).
On October 29, 2007, OSHP personnel were told by Defendants Sgt. Bloomberg and/or Sgt. Helsinger that Plaintiff had been terminated from his employment for "lying." (Id. at ¶¶107-109). Employees gossiped about the reason for Plaintiff's termination. (Id. at ¶¶110-11). Ultimately, Plaintiff was not terminated but was instead given a second chance to continue his employment by agreeing to extend his probationary period. (Id. at ¶113). Plaintiff alleges that the agreement, signed on or about November 6, 2007, was obtained through fraud, and was imposed on him as punishment without notice or an opportunity for hearing. (Id. at ¶¶113-116).
Around the same period of time, Plaintiff had submitted a request to transfer to OSHP outposts in Batavia or Lebanon. (Id. at ¶118).  [*7] Plaintiff alleges that his transfer requests were not properly processed or maintained. Instead, Plaintiff contends he was reassigned to the Piqua Outpost on November 11, 2007, based upon false accusations of misconduct. (Id. at ¶¶122-124). Plaintiff subsequently received a package, delivered to him at the Piqua Outpost from a co-worker through the OSHP inter-office, intra-departmental mail system. He complains that in that package was personal mail that had previously been delivered to the Wilmington Outpost, some of which had been tampered with and delayed for up to 11 months prior to being forwarded to him at the Piqua Outpost. (Id. at ¶¶130-133).
On February 11, 2008, Plaintiff alleges that, as a consequence of wrongful disciplinary procedures, he was fraudulently induced to sign an adverse employment agreement, in part through false representations that Plaintiff's "extended" probationary period was valid and would not end until February 13, 2008. (Id. at ¶¶137-142). It appears that Plaintiff alleges that he was wrongfully terminated, but subsequently reinstated upon signing the adverse employment agreement the same day (Id. at ¶¶137, 143). Plaintiff continues to work at the Piqua  [*8] Outpost to this day.
Between May 2008 and February 2009, Plaintiff made "at least six" public records requests from OSHP and the Ohio Department of Public Safety ("ODPS"). (Id. at ¶148). Plaintiff alleges that the two organizational Defendants belatedly produced some of the requested records, but that they have failed to timely produce more than 1,400 public records he has requested, in violation of Ohio law. (Id. at ¶¶155-156).

B. Procedural Background
Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 14, 2009 (Doc. 7), and a second amended complaint on May 11, 2010 (Doc. 55). Defendants previously moved to dismiss Plaintiff's first amended complaint for most of the same reasons contained in their current motion to dismiss Plaintiff's second amended complaint. (Doc. 28). Instead of responding to that motion to dismiss, Plaintiff moved to amend his complaint. Because Plaintiff had moved for leave to file a second amended complaint before the Court had the opportunity to rule on Defendants' motion to dismiss—and at the Defendants' suggestion- the Court denied Defendants' first motion to dismiss as moot. (Doc. 52).
A description of the second amended complaint is contained in the Court's Order  [*9] of September 30, 2010:
Plaintiff's second amended complaint is 264 paragraphs long and 77 pages in length. It is brought against the same thirteen individuals and John and Jane Doe defendants named in the original and amended complaints. The second amended complaint alleges eleven causes of action, including federal claims for violation of 42 U.S.C. §1983, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000e, Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §12111, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §794, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. §201; state law claims of unlawful civil conspiracy, fraudulent inducement, tortious interference with certain rights, and breach of contract; a claim for declaratory relief; and a "verified petition for writ of mandamus for violations of Ohio Public Records Act, Ohio Revised Code § 149.43, et seq." (Doc. 55).
(Doc. 86 at 2-3). As soon as Plaintiff's second amended complaint was filed of record, Defendants promptly filed the instant motion to dismiss it. 2
Once again, before the Court had an opportunity to rule on Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's second amended complaint, Plaintiff moved for leave to file a third amended complaint (Doc. 81). Finding Plaintiff's repeat procedural maneuver to be inappropriate, the Court denied Plaintiff leave to amend a third time:
Plaintiff Kohus's motion to amend his complaint a third time is DENIED. At the time of the Court's scheduling conference, plaintiff Kohus represented that he anticipated the appearance of counsel on his behalf in this case. With that in mind, the Court set what it viewed as an appropriate length of time needed for amendment by an attorney, not by plaintiff Kohus pro se. Although Kohus did not obtain counsel, he nevertheless moved to file an 87 page, 292-paragraph third amended complaint which is even lengthier than his  [*11] 77-page, 264-paragraph second amended complaint.
Plaintiff Kohus's motion to amend the complaint does not set forth any reasons justifying an amendment of the complaint for a third time. Plaintiff does not identify what is being amended and why such proposed amendments could not have been previously included in any of the other amendments of his complaint. While defendants have admirably attempted to chart out the differences between the second amended complaint and the proposed third amended complaint (Doc. 83 at 2-10), this Court declines to dissect the two to discern what is different between the complaints when plaintiff himself has not taken the time to justify his need for yet another amendment of his complaint. Rule 8(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., requires a complaint to set forth "a short plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Plaintiff Kohus has failed to explain why he now needs more than 264 paragraphs to explain why he is entitled to relief in this case.
The Court recognizes that generally leave to amend a complaint should be freely granted "when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). In this case, however, amendment of the complaint  [*12] for a third time would only add to the mounds of paper already filed in this action without any articulated or cognizable need for an amendment.
(Doc. 86 at 5-6).
Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's second amended complaint presents multiple grounds for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). In addition, all individual Defendants have moved for qualified immunity. (Docs. 54, 56). Virtually all of Defendants' arguments are meritorious. In an effort to bring some semblance of organization to the disparate claims included in Plaintiff's prolix complaint, this R&R will address the grounds presented for dismissal largely in the order presented in Defendants' motion, which in turn generally tracks Plaintiff's eleven claims in the order presented in his complaint.

II. Applicable Pleading Standard
Before turning to the merits of Defendants' motion and each of Plaintiff's claims, it is important to set forth the relevant pleading standard required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff argues vigorously that he is entitled to a relaxed standard because he proceeds pro se, whereas Defendants' motion is predicated on the notion that all litigants are required to meet the same basic standard  [*13] under Rule 8. Defendants are correct.
A plaintiff is required under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) to plead "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." For many years, courts employed a short-hand summary of this standard by suggesting that a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim would be granted only if a plaintiff could prove "no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief." Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). However, in recent years, the Supreme Court has brought greater focus to the pleading standard, holding first in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 563, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1969, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) that the "famous" no-set-of-facts formulation "has earned its retirement" and instituting a new standard that a complaint must contain facts sufficient to "state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face" Id. at 1974. In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009), the Supreme Court elaborated further, explaining: "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. at 1949.
Under  [*14] Iqbal, a trial court evaluating a complaint must cipher out "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements" from legal conclusions that are supported by factual allegations. Id. The first step is to identify the elements of the plaintiff's claim, in order to determine which allegations are mere legal conclusions, as opposed to factual allegations entitled to the "assumption of truth." Id. at 1951 ("We begin...by identifying the allegations in the complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of truth"). After determining which allegations pertain to factual elements of a plaintiff's claim, a court is required to evaluate those allegations to determine "whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief." Id. at 1950.
Plaintiff argues that because he proceeds pro se, this court should construe his complaint liberally and hold him "to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 292, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976)(internal quotation marks and additional citations omitted). However, as the Supreme Court has recently made clear, even pro se plaintiffs must allege facts that  [*15] are sufficient "to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965. Moreover, Plaintiff has twice amended his complaint in this case. Plaintiff's second amendment came after Defendants filed a prior motion to dismiss based on nearly identical grounds to those raised in the present motion; thus, Plaintiff has had ample opportunity to address the current challenges to the sufficiency of his complaint.
When evaluating Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., this Court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff and must accept all factual allegations contained therein as true. See Lambert v. Hartman, 517 F.3d 433 438-39 (6th Cir. 2008). "A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is a test of the plaintiff's cause of action as stated in the complaint, not a challenge to the plaintiff's factual allegations." Golden v. City of Columbus, 404 F.3d 950, 958-59 (6th Cir. 2005). Thus, if a complaint contains "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face," it will survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.
Although the pleading  [*16] standard of Twombly and Iqbal appears clear, additional brief discussion is warranted concerning Plaintiff's contention that he is not required to plead all elements of all claims. Plaintiff heavily relies on Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 510, 122 S.Ct. 992, 997, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002), arguing that his allegations need not satisfy a prima facie standard for any particular claim. However, the holding of Swierkiewicz—that the burden of proof in an employment discrimination case is an "evidentiary standard" rather than a "pleading requirement"- is by its terms limited to employment discrimination claims that rely on the burden-shifting McDonnell Douglas standard. Swierkiewicz most certainly does not stand for the proposition that in order to state a claim under, for example, 42 U.S.C. §1983, a plaintiff need only make allegations that relate to some of the required elements. And, even in the employment discrimination context, it remains an open question in the Sixth Circuit whether Twombly and Iqbal have effectively abrogated the portion of Swierkiewicz on which Plaintiff relies. See e.g. Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 211 (3d. Cir. 2009) ("because Conley has been specifically repudiated  [*17] by both Twombly and Iqbal, so too has Swierkiewicz."); Anoai v. Mildford Exempted School Dist., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1159, 2011 WL 53164 at *5 n. 1 (S.D. Ohio Jan 6, 2011)(noting that Swierkiewicz has been abrogated by Iqbal and Twombly). For purposes of Defendants' motion to dismiss—and with the lone possible exception being Plaintiff's Title VII claim—the Defendants will be entitled to dismissal if Plaintiff's allegations fail to satisfy the Iqbal standard.

III. Analysis of Each of Plaintiff's Causes of Action
As previously stated, Plaintiff's second amended complaint contains at least eleven separate causes of action. Plaintiff's federal claims, which are addressed first, fall under the following six federal statutes: 1) 42 U.S.C. §1983; 2) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000e; 3) Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; 4) 42 U.S.C. §12111, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; 5) 29 U.S.C. §794, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; and 6) 29 U.S.C. §201. In addition to his federal claims, Plaintiff asserts state law claims of unlawful civil conspiracy, fraudulent inducement, tortious interference with certain rights, and breach of contract. Finally, Plaintiff  [*18] makes a claim for declaratory relief; and a "verified petition for writ of mandamus for violations of Ohio Public Records Act, Ohio Revised Code § 149.43, et seq." (Doc. 55).

A. 42 U.S.C. §1983
The vast majority of Plaintiff's allegations appear to relate to his claim that one or more Defendants violated 42 U.S.C. §1983. To present a claim under §1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the specified defendant has violated a clearly established constitutional right. In this case, Plaintiff argues that Defendants have violated numerous constitutional rights, including procedural and substantive due process rights concerning his property interest in his job and employment reputation, his Fourth Amendment rights concerning his personal mail, his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. As discussed below, a review of Plaintiff's allegations fails to reveal the basis for any of the claimed violations of Plaintiff's constitutional rights. In addition, the allegations against most Defendants fail to provide them with adequate notice of what each is alleged to have done.

1. Failure to Identify Conduct of Most Individual Defendants
With few exceptions,  [*19] Plaintiff fails to specify which Defendant engaged in what conduct that may have violated any constitutional right. Instead, most of the allegations of the complaint simply allege generally that "the defendants" or that one "and/or" all other individual Defendants discriminated against Plaintiff or violated his constitutional rights. (See, e.g., ¶¶77, 80, 82-86).
In order to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983, Plaintiff is required to plead "that each Government-official defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution." Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1948. With the exception of Defendants New, Lee and Crisafi, a review of the complaint fails to reveal sufficiently specific allegations against any of the Defendants that would place him or her on notice of the constitutional violation he or she is alleged to have committed.
In addition, an allegation that a particular Defendant is liable based on a failure to supervise will not do, because a supervisor cannot be held liable under 42 U.S.C. §1983 unless he or she directly participated in or encouraged the alleged violation of constitutional rights. Searcy v. City of Dayton, 38 F.3d 282, 287 (6th Cir. 1994).  [*20] In this case, Plaintiff's only allegations against Defendant Dr. Guzman, Defendant Col. Collins, and Defendant Maj. Ludlow, at a minimum, appear to be based exclusively upon their supervisory roles.
Reference to the specific allegations pertaining to the claim that all Defendants have violated 42 U.S.C. §1983 is instructive. Plaintiff generally alleges:
The defendants Dir. Guzman, Col. Collins, Maj. Ludlow, Maj. Kolcum, Maj. Teaford, S.Lt. Allard, S.Lt. Linek, Lt. Lee, Sgt. New, Sgt. Crisafi and John and/or Jane Doe(s) 2-50, and each of them, have taken action and/or have adopted customs, policies, practices, procedures, or usages, fostering, promoting and/or condoning (and/or they have failed or refused to adopt or observe appropriate measures preventing) discriminatory disparate employment treatment of Plaintiff, at least in part because his engagement in statutorily protected labor activities (and in retaliation or reprisal for same), all resulting in unconstitutional deprivations and denials of Tpr. Kohus's (a) right of protection against unreasonable searches and/or seizures of his personal property; (b) right to representation/legal counsel; (c) right to remain silent; (d) right  [*21] to be free of undue stigmatization; (e) right to be free from and (f) rights to protected property and/or liberty interests—to which he had legitimate and reasonable expectations and/or entitlements—in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and to equal protection and due process of law under U.S. Constitution Amendments 5 and/or 14. The individually named defendants' unconstitutional and discriminatory acts, acts abusive of the individual defendants' power, were committed under color of state law.
The defendants, by unilaterally and illegally changing the dates that constituted the final date of his initial probationary employment period, continually and systematically denied him a right to the CBA defined rights to due process. Without the defendants' illegal actions, the [sic] Tpr. Kohus would never have been coerced and threatened into signing an extension of his probation.
(Doc. 55 at ¶¶185-186).
In response to Defendants' argument that his claim fails to articulate who did what, Plaintiff argues that he "does not have access to the necessary materials at this stage of litigation to be able to specify with any certainty who is  [*22] responsible for each incident." (Doc. 97 at 4). As discussed infra, Plaintiff is simply incorrect as to the pleading standard required by Rule 8. While he need not have all of the proof to support his claim at the pleading stage, he is required to specify "who did what" in order to state a claim against each individual Defendant under §1983. Plaintiff's conclusory claim that all of the Defendants violated §1983 is facially deficient and should be dismissed as to each Defendant except for New, Lee and Crisafi.

2. Failure to Establish Procedural or Substantive Due Process Claim
In addition to Plaintiff's failure to identify the allegedly culpable actions of most of the individual Defendants, Plaintiff has failed to establish that any Defendant (including Defendants New, Lee and Crisafi) violated either his procedural or substantive due process rights.
To establish a procedural due process violation, Plaintiff must show that he had a property interest in his job, and that Defendants deprived him of that interest without due process. In this case, Plaintiff's assertion that he is a member of the OSTA and subject to that labor union's collective bargaining agreement ("CBA"), which contains  [*23] grievance and arbitration procedures, defeats his claim. "The grievance procedure shall be the exclusive method of resolving both contractual and disciplinary grievances." (Doc. 102-1, Article 20, §20.01 at 30). The Sixth Circuit has held that binding arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement satisfies post-deprivation due process requirements. See, e.g., American Postal Workers Union Columbus Area Local AFL-CIO v. United States Postal Serv., 736 F.2d 317, 319 (6th Cir. 1984).
Plaintiff's concerns with his rate of pay (Doc. 55 at ¶31), his appointment date (id. at ¶33), the hours he worked (id. at ¶42), the investigation over his car accident (id. at ¶¶78-79, 87-89), the requested polygraph test (id. at ¶¶91-94), his transfer to Piqua instead of his requested locations (id. at ¶¶119-22), and the extension of his probationary period (id. at ¶137) all could have been grieved under the CBA. Thus, the CBA provided adequate procedural due process.
One of Plaintiff's central due process claims concerns the extension of his probationary period, which he asserts expired on or about October 27, 2007 and could not thereafter be extended beyond 365 days under the CBA. Plaintiff complains  [*24] that his probationary status was "unlawfully" extended after he became a permanent employee, on November 13, 2007. However, the same provision of the CBA provides that the probationary period "may be extended by mutual agreement between the Union and Management" with no reference to the employee's assent. 3 (Doc. 102-1, Article 16 at 23).
In response to Defendants' argument that adequate due process remedies existed under the CBA, Plaintiff contends that he could not file a grievance under the CBA because he was ineligible to do so as a "probationary employee." (Doc. 97 at 9-10). Both parties direct this court's attention to Section 20.03 of the OSTA agreement, which states that "[i]nitial probationary employees shall not have access to the disciplinary grievance procedure." (Doc.102-1 at 30).
If Plaintiff actually was a probationary employee, however, he had no property interest in his continued employment and therefore can claim no due process violation.  [*25] See Ste. Marie v. City of Dayton, 109 F. Supp.2d 846 (S.D. Ohio 2000). In addition, the referenced provision of the CBA is silent as to probationary employees' ability to file contractual grievances. While most of Plaintiff's complaints concern actions that Plaintiff describes as "disciplinary" (including verbal and written reprimands, extension of his probationary period and transfer to Piqua), at least a few of Plaintiff's concerns involve contractual grievances—providing some due process regardless of the status of Plaintiff's property interest.
With respect to Plaintiff's access to the disciplinary grievance procedure under the OSTA agreement, the referenced provision denies access to grievance and arbitration procedures only for "initial probationary employees." At least arguably, Plaintiff was not an "initial probationary employee" but an extended probationary employee under Article 16 of the CBA. If Plaintiff was deemed not to be a probationary employee at all (to the extent that any extension of his probation was invalid) or if he was not categorized as an "initial probationary employee," then he was entitled to invoke the grievance and arbitration provisions under the CBA.  [*26] A determination as to whether any grievance filed by Plaintiff should be barred as "disciplinary" would be determined in the first instance by the arbitrator. See generally United Steelworkers of Am., AFL-CIO v. St. Gobain Ceramics & Plastics, 505 F.3d 417 (6th Cir. 2007)(holding that procedural issues concerning arbitratability are to be determined by arbitrator).
In short, a procedural due process claim exists only if inadequate remedies are available under state law. Plaintiff cannot complain that CBA provisions were inadequate merely because Defendants describe him as some category of "probationary employee." See Collyer v. Darling, 98 F.3d 211, 223-27 (6th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1267, 117 S. Ct. 2439, 138 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997)(arbitrator could have looked beyond label despite plaintiff's contention that defendants had played "shell games" by telling him certain remedies were unavailable, remedies were sufficient to defeat procedural due process claim). Nor can plaintiff complain that remedies were inadequate on the basis that his union declined to file a grievance on his behalf. The availability of a post-deprivation arbitration remedy is adequate to satisfy due process considerations even if the union  [*27] declines to arbitrate a grievance. See Hennigh v. City of Shawnee, 155 F.3d 1249, 1256 (10th Cir. 1998).
Plaintiff further complains that his procedural due process rights under the CBA were violated when Defendants failed to adhere to the progressive disciplinary measures dictated by the CBA. Ultimately, however, like all other complaints concerning contractual or disciplinary violations of the CBA contract, this claim fails to raise a procedural due process claim in light of the availability of arbitration under the CBA.
Plaintiff also has failed to establish any substantive due process claim, because substantive due process does not protect statutory or contractual rights to tenure in public employment. See Charles v. Baesler, 910 F.2d 1349,1354-56 (6th Cir. 1990)(state created property interest in fire captain's position not "fundamental" protected right). In any event, none of the conduct alleged by Plaintiff is so outrageous that it would "shock the conscience" such as to state a violation of substantive due process.

3. Roth Reputation Claim
In addition to failing to demonstrate any procedural or substantive due process claim, Plaintiff has failed to make out a claim for a due process  [*28] violation based on his liberty interest in his employment reputation. In Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 573, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972), the Supreme Court held that when a public employer seriously injures the reputation of an employee coupled with a serious change in work status, such an injury may, under some conditions, constitute the deprivation of a "liberty interest." The Court held that in such cases, the employee is entitled to a "name-clearing hearing" including notice and the opportunity to refute the reputation-damaging information.
The Sixth Circuit has defined a Roth claim as requiring five elements: 1) that stigmatizing statements were made in conjunction with termination from employment; 2) that the employer alleged more than merely improper or inadequate performance, incompetence, neglect of duty or malfeasance; 3) that the stigmatizing statements were made public; 4) that the charges were false; and 5) that the public dissemination was voluntary. See Ludwig v. Bd. Of Trustees of Ferris State Univ., 123 F.3d 404, 410 (6th Cir. 1997). In addition to these elements, a plaintiff must have requested and been denied the opportunity for a "name-clearing" hearing.
Plaintiff contends that  [*29] he has made out a Roth claim by alleging that Defendants falsely accused him of lying about the August 2007 car incident and disciplined him on two separate occasions. Plaintiff accuses Defendants of stigmatizing him by publicly disseminating false accusations that he was dishonest. See Roth, 408 U.S. at 573 (suggesting that failure to renew non-tenured employee on grounds of dishonesty or immorality would have required notice and an opportunity to be heard).
Even though Defendants are alleged to have accused Plaintiff of dishonesty in connection with the August 2007 car accident, the Defendants are entitled to dismissal of this claim because Plaintiff fails to allege other key elements. In particular, Plaintiff fails to allege: 1) that the stigmatizing statements were made in conjunction with a change in status akin to termination, 2) that the stigmatizing statements were voluntarily made "public" by Defendants or 3) that Plaintiff demanded and was denied a "name-clearing hearing."
With respect to proof of a change in his employment status, Plaintiff argues that he experienced to a significant change in status at least twice. First, on November 6, 2007, Plaintiff alleges that he was  [*30] forced to sign an agreement extending his probationary period for 110 days retroactively. A few days later, Plaintiff was reassigned to the Piqua outpost. Second, on February 11, 2008 he asserts that he was terminated prior to being reinstated under a "last chance" agreement.
Based on Sixth Circuit case law, however, none of these events implicates Plaintiff's liberty interest. Although Plaintiff's probationary period was extended, to the extent that Plaintiff was ever momentarily "terminated," he lost neither pay nor position, and he remains employed by the OSHP. An employee who remains employed by his State employer cannot claim a liberty interest violation under Roth. See Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 710, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 1165, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1976)(noting Roth involved termination, and that "there is no suggestion in Roth to indicate that a hearing would be required each time the State in its capacity as employer might be considered responsible for a statement defaming an employee who continues to be an employee."); see also Ludwig, 123 F.3d at 410 (listing termination as element of claim); Johnson v. Morris, 903 F.2d 996, 999-1000 (4th Cir. 1990); Hershinow v. Bonamarte, 735 F.2d 264, 266 (7th Cir. 1984);  [*31] Brown v. City of Detroit, 259 F. Supp.2d 611, 621 (E.D. Mich. 2003)(mere impact on terms and conditions of police officer's employment insufficient).
Because he remains employed with no reduction in pay or benefits, Plaintiff has not experienced a sufficient change in employment status in this case to implicate a liberty interest. The type of liberty interest that Roth is intended to protect is a significant one, one akin to the right to future employment. "A charge that merely makes a plaintiff less attractive to other employers but leaves open a definite range of opportunity does not constitute a liberty deprivation." Ludwig v. Bd. Of Trustees of Ferris State Univ., 123 F.3d 404, 410 (6th Cir. 1997)(quoting Chilingirian v. Boris, 882 F.2d 200, 206 n.8 (6th Cir. 1989)). As another court stated, "to infringe an employee's liberty interests, the circumstances of the termination must make it virtually impossible for the employee to find new employment in that field." Lashbrook v. Oerkfitz, 65 F.3d 1339, 1348-49 (7th Cir. 1995).
Plaintiff mistakenly argues that Ludwig is limited in application to "nontenured" employees. (Doc. 97 at 6). Plaintiff also asserts that "[n]o law enforcement agency  [*32] would hire an individual who is perceived to be dishonest." (Doc. 97 at 8). Thus, Plaintiff contends that he is "essentially barred from employment" by any law enforcement agency other than OSHP. (Id.). However, Ludwig requires actual termination by the defendant employer regardless of whether the employee has a property interest in his or her continued status. See, e.g., Gunasekera v. Irwin, 551 F.3d 461 (6th Cir. 2009).
In addition to failing to allege termination, Plaintiff's Roth claim fails because he fails to allege that Defendants made their defamatory comments "public" in such a way as to implicate his liberty interest. Plaintiff complains that Defendants told other employees that he was "dishonest." Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Crisafi related information to Crisafi's wife, who in turn disseminated false information to the Cincinnati Police Department. However, the fact that Defendant Crisafi's wife allegedly stated that Plaintiff was a "liar" and that some Defendants were "working" to get Plaintiff "fired" is not publication by a Defendant. Although Plaintiff alleges that Defendants published "stigmatizing information" to other police departments, he offers  [*33] no allegations concerning the "publication" other than the statement by Defendant Crisafi's wife. In order for a Roth violation to occur, the damaging remark must be "public," meaning something more than documents in Plaintiff's personnel file or rumors at Plaintiff's place of employment. Compare Hade v. City of Fremont, 246 F. Supp. 2d 837, 845 (N.D. Ohio 2003)(publication in two newspapers).
Even if Plaintiff's fleeting "termination" or extension of his probationary period were found to allege a sufficient change in employment status under Roth, and even if the defamatory comments were made "public," Plaintiff's Roth claim still would fail because he failed to request a name-clearing hearing. See Garner v. City of Cuyahoga Falls, 311 Fed. Appx. 896, 2009 WL 426078 (6th Cir. 2009)(upholding dismissal of §1983 complaint where Plaintiff alleged that he was not provided name-clearing hearing but failed to allege he had requested one). Plaintiff suggests that he should not have had to request a hearing because his employer failed to apprise him of the right to one, but no such affirmative duty to advise an employee of his right to a hearing has been upheld in the Sixth Circuit. See Quinn v. Shirey, 293 F.3d 315, 323-324 (6th Cir. 2002)(holding  [*34] that a plaintiff who fails to request a hearing has no cause of action, whether or not he had been informed of his right to a hearing). Moreover, Garner is not distinguishable. In that case, like here, the Plaintiff had alleged that he was denied a hearing but had failed to allege that he had requested one. Like Garner, Plaintiff amended his complaint after being apprised of alleged deficiencies, but still failed to allege that he ever requested a hearing. Plaintiff's allegation for the first time in his memorandum in opposition to Defendants' present motion to dismiss that he "repeatedly" requested a hearing- with no additional details provided—is insufficient to satisfy the essential elements of his claim.

4. No Violation of Equal Protection Clause
Proceeding through the litany of constitutional rights that Defendants are alleged to have abridged, I conclude that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any violation of his equal protection rights. Although Plaintiff alleges that he was treated differently than his peers, there is no "class-of-one" theory of equal protection in the public employment context. Engquist v. Oregon Dep't of Agriculture, 553 U.S. 591, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 2148-49, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975 (2008).

5. No Fourth Amendment  [*35] Violations
Plaintiff alleges that unspecified individual Defendants engaged in a "search and seizure" of his personal mail, because the package of mail forwarded to him at the Piqua Outpost had originally been delivered to the Wilmington Outpost many months earlier, and some of the mail had been opened at some point by an unknown person or persons. Plaintiff relies heavily on United States v. Van Leeuwen, 397 U.S. 249, 90 S. Ct. 1029, 25 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1970) as support for his Fourth Amendment Claim; however, that case did not involve mail addressed or delivered to a public employee at a public facility.
In contrast to Van Leeuwen, Plaintiff cannot claim an expectation of privacy in intra-departmental mail, and correspondingly, cannot claim a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Indeed, similar claims have been rejected out of hand by the courts. See, e.g., Wheeler v. King, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13679, 1991 WL 195488 at *5 (E.D. La. Sept. 20, 1991)("An individual cannot have a reasonable expectation of privacy...in mail which is sent to him at his place of employment through his employer's mail system."). See also generally City of Ontario, Cal. v. Quon, 130 S. Ct. 2619, 177 L. Ed. 2d 216 (2010)(declining to establish a blanket rule concerning Fourth Amendment  [*36] protections in workplace).
In addition to failing to establish a sufficient expectation of privacy in mail delivered through his employer's mail system, Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a claim as a matter of law because he is unable to identify any specific action that any specific Defendant undertook to violate his claimed Fourth Amendment rights. He does not allege, for example that any particular Defendant opened or delayed delivery of his mail; in fact, it is entirely possible that a third party was responsible. In addition, and as discussed more fully below, the individual Defendants would be entitled to qualified immunity on any Fourth Amendment claim that may exist, because Plaintiff's right to have his mail promptly forwarded by his employer through the inter-departmental mail system, without the possibility of being opened (whether deliberately or mistakenly), is not clearly established.

6. No Fifth or Sixth Amendment Violations
The protections of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are generally limited to the criminal arena. Plaintiff does not allege that he has been charged in any criminal proceeding, or that he has a reasonable expectation of being so charged.  [*37] Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to make out a violation of §1983 based upon any violation of his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights. See, e.g., Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 87 S. Ct. 616, 17 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1967)(Fifth Amendment); Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602, 607-08, 113 S. Ct. 2801, 125 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1983)(Sixth Amendment).
The Fifth Amendment cases relied upon by Plaintiff, Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273, 88 S. Ct. 1913, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1082 (1968) and Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 94 S. Ct. 316, 38 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1973) are distinguishable and do not compel a different result. Both involved compelled testimony before a grand jury, not an employer's internal investigation. Garrity established that "when a public employer conducts an internal investigation it may dismiss an employee who refuses to answer investigative questions, but it may not use any incriminating statements against the employee in a criminal prosecution regarding the matter under investigation." Accord McKinley v. City of Mansfield, 404 F.3d 418, 423 (6th Cir. 2005). However, Garrity does not prevent a public employer from asking incriminating questions during an internal investigation, nor does it impose a blanket rule that the employer must offer immunity. Thus, a police sergeant's coercive questioning which results in compelled  [*38] testimony that is not used in any criminal proceeding does not violate the Fifth Amendment. See Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 772, 123 S. Ct. 1994, 155 L. Ed. 2d 984 (no §1983 action against police sergeant who failed to provide Miranda warning).
The case relied upon by Plaintiff in support of his Sixth Amendment claim, N.L.R.B. v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. 251, 95 S. Ct. 959, 43 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1975) is equally distinguishable. Weingarten was not a Sixth Amendment case but instead concerned a determination of whether an employer had committed an unfair labor practice by failing to permit an employee to have a union representative present during an internal investigation. An alleged violation of federal labor law has no application to States as employers or to their employees. 29 U.S.C. §152(2) and (3). To the extent Plaintiff is claiming a violation of similar rights under Ohio law, the State Employment Relations Board and not this Court would have jurisdiction over his claim. State ex rel. Dep't of Mental Health v. Nadel, 98 Ohio St.3d 405, 2003 Ohio 1632, 786 N.E.2d 49 (2003).

7. Qualified Immunity
The individual Defendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on grounds that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate, or even adequately plead, that any  [*39] of them has violated a "clearly established" constitutional right. As should be evident from the extensive analysis above, I agree that Plaintiff has failed to establish the violation of any clearly established constitutional right. Therefore, I also agree that each of the individual Defendants is entitled to qualified immunity from suit in this case. See generally, Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 646 n. 6, 107 S. Ct. 3034, 3042, 97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987).
As stated, most of the allegations in Plaintiff's second amended complaint relate to his §1983 claims. In the remainder of this opinion, I will address Defendants' motion concerning Plaintiff's other state and federal claims.

B. 42 U.S.C. §2000e (Title VII Claim)
In his second claim, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants discriminated against him in violation of his religion by asking him to take a polygraph test during the investigation of the August 2007 accident. Plaintiff now contends that he refused to take the polygraph test based upon his Roman Catholic religious beliefs. Although he does not identify in his complaint what belief might prohibit taking a polygraph test, in his response in opposition to Defendants' motion Plaintiff states that he  [*40] "steadfastly adheres to Roman Catholic tenets that prohibit swearing." 4 (Doc. 97 at 14).
To establish a claim of religious discrimination, Plaintiff must show that: (1) he holds a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a job requirement; (2) he informed his employer of the conflict; and (3) he suffered an adverse employment action for failing to comply with the requirement. See Reed v. Int'l Union, United Auto., Aerospace and Agr. Implement Workers of America, 569 F.3d 576 (6th Cir. 2009).
Plaintiff's discrimination claim fails in this case because Plaintiff identifies no tenet of the Roman Catholic faith that prohibits him from taking a polygraph test. As Defendants are quick to point out, a polygraph examination does not require that the person being examined swear to tell the truth under any oath. In fact, Plaintiff does not claim (and Defendants would dispute) that he was asked to "swear" in order to take the polygraph test in this case. An additional deficiency of Plaintiff's claim is his failure to allege that he informed any named  [*41] Defendant of the alleged conflict. While Plaintiff's complaint alleges that he made clear that he refused to take the polygraph, he does not allege that he advised Defendants of any religious basis for his refusal. (Doc. 55 at ¶95). Finally, Plaintiff alleges no adverse employment action.
In addition to failing to establish the elements of his Title VII religious discrimination claim against any Defendant, Plaintiff also fails to state a claim against any of the individually named Defendants. Supervisors and individual managers are not included in the definition of "employer" under Title VII and cannot be held personally liable for employment discrimination under that statute. See Wathen v. General Electric Co., 115 F.3d 400, 404-05 (6th Cir. 1997).

C. §42 U.S.C. §12101, et seq. (Disability Discrimination Claim) and 29 U.S.C. §794, et seq. (Rehabilitation Act)
Plaintiff also fails to state a plausible disability discrimination claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act. Construing Plaintiff's complaint liberally, the basis of both claims is Plaintiff's assertion that he either has a disability or is "regarded as" having a disability; namely, ADHD.

1. Eleventh Amendment  [*42] Immunity for ADA Claim
While a Rehabilitation Act claim is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, any ADA claim against Defendants OSHP and ODPS must be dismissed as barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. See Bd. Of Trustees, Univ. of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 121 S. Ct. 955, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2001)(doctrine not abrogated by ADA). Plaintiff argues in his responsive memorandum that Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908) permits him to seek prospective injunctive relief under some circumstances, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment bar against monetary damages. While a fair statement of the law, Plaintiff seeks no relief that falls within the Ex Parte Young exception. Plaintiff does not technically seek prospective relief, to the extent that his extended probationary periods and last chance employment agreement would have expired by now.

2. Individual Supervisors Not Liable
In any event, to the extent that Plaintiff seeks to bring his ADA or Rehabilitation Act claims against any Defendant in his or her individual capacity, the Defendants are entitled to dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims. Individual supervisors may not be held liable under either the ADA, see Sullivan v. River Valley School Dist., 197 F.3d 804, 808 n. 1 (6th Cir. 1999),  [*43] or the Rehabilitation Act, see Hiler v. Brown, 177 F.3d 542, 546-47 (6th Cir. 1999). 5

3. Failure to Establish Elements of Disability Claim
Insofar as Plaintiff seeks relief against his employer alone, Plaintiff fails to plead a plausible disability. The burden rests on Plaintiff to establish the existence of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity under pre-2009 law. See Doren v. Battle Creek Health Sys., 187 F.3d 595, 598 (6th Cir. 1999). That showing cannot be made merely by alleging a diagnosis of ADHD. See Toyota Motor Mfg., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 193-194, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002).
In his complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he has "developed ways to cope with and reduce the impact of the impairment, for example, on his reading comprehension, to become a highly productive and successful person." (Doc. 55 at ¶47). He alleges that he attained an overall score in the 97th percentile on his written entrance examination for the OSHP. (Id. at ¶50). Therefore, Plaintiff's own allegations undermine any  [*44] contention that his ADHD substantially limits the major life activity of learning. See Knapp v. City of Columbus, 192 Fed. Appx. 323 (6th Cir. 2006)(firefighters with ADHD who failed test not disabled within meaning of ADA absent evidence that they were substantially limited in the major life activity of leaning); Bercovitch v. Baldwin School, Inc., 133 F.3d 141, 155 (1st Cir. 1998)(Plaintiff with ADHD not impaired in learning where plaintiff never experienced significant academic difficulties, even if condition affected capacity to achieve maximum learning and working potential).
In addition, Plaintiff complains only generally that the Defendants declined to provide reasonable accommodations and denied him use of his "coping mechanisms" but never articulates what accommodations he sought or what his "coping mechanisms" might be. (Doc. 97 at 17). The ADA protects only "qualified" individuals who are able to perform their duties with "reasonable" accommodations. See Burns v. Coca-Cola Enters., Inc., 222 F.3d 247, 256 (6th Cir. 2000). Plaintiff's failure to articulate specific facts—not only in his complaint but even in his response in opposition—confirms that lack of any articulable basis  [*45] for his claim.
I conclude that Plaintiff also fails to show that he suffered an "adverse employment action" or a nexus between the adverse employment action and his disability. An "adverse employment action" ordinarily includes termination, a decrease in salary or less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly reduced responsibilities, and the like. See Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, 97 F.3d 876, 886-887 (6th Cir. 1996); see also Bowman v. Shawnee State Univ., 220 F.3d 456, 461-62 (6th Cir. 2000)(citing cases). It is not entirely clear what "adverse employment action" Plaintiff claims resulted from his ADHD. He appears to allege that he was written up for paperwork violations resulting from his ADHD, but disciplinary actions that do not result in a loss of pay are not ordinarily "adverse." See, e.g., Lucas v. Chicago Transit Auth., 367 F.3d 714, 731 (7th Cir. 2004)(reprimand not material); Hollins. v. Atlantic Co., 188 F.3d 652, 662 (6th Cir. 1999)(poor evaluation not materially adverse in absence of effect on wages, benefits, or promotion).
Plaintiff's reassignment to Piqua from Wilmington—a distance of 63 miles- presents a closer issue. Notably, however, Plaintiff  [*46] does not directly attribute his reassignment to Piqua to his ADHD. Even if related, his transfer might not be considered to be a materially adverse employment action under the circumstances presented. See Policastro v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 297 F.3d 535 (6th Cir. 2002)(reassignment without change in pay or benefits); Griffin v. Potter, 356 F.3d 824 (7th Cir. 2004)(transfer that lengthened commute and charges of unfair discipline not adverse); but see Keeton v. Flying J., 429 F.3d 259 (6th Cir. 2005)(holding that transfer could constitute constructive discharge).

E. 29 U.S.C. §201 (FLSA)
Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants violated the Fair Labor Standards Act when he was made to work overtime without compensation. However, due to the unique nature of their jobs, law enforcement agencies are permitted to require law enforcement officers to work more than 40 hours per week without overtime compensation, so long as additional conditions are met as specified by 29 U.S.C. §207(k). Plaintiff's allegations fail to state a claim under 29 U.S.C. §207(k). Plaintiff's FLSA claims against his Ohio employer are also barred, because the Eleventh Amendment bars suit under the FLSA by private  [*47] citizens against the state. See Wilson-Jones v. Caviness, 99 F.3d 203 (6th Cir. 1997), modified, 107 F.3d 358 (6th Cir. 1997).

F. Unlawful Civil Conspiracy
Plaintiff's "conspiracy" claim is conclusory, and rests entirely on allegations that Plaintiff fails to show amount to a violation of the United States Constitution or any federal law. Vague and conclusory claims of conspiracy, unsupported by specific allegations of material fact, are insufficient to support a conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983. See Jackson v. City of Columbus, 194 F.3d 737, 753 (6th Cir. 1999), overruled on other grounds, Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). In any event, Plaintiff's "conspiracy" charge would fail because the only "conspiracy" he alleges is between agents of the same employer acting within the scope of their employment. An entity cannot conspire with itself. See Johnson v. Hills & Dales General Hosp., 40 F.3d 837, 839-41 (6th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1066, 115 S. Ct. 1698, 131 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1995). Plaintiff also fails to establish any class-based animus as required to establish a conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. §1985(3).

G. State Law Claims
Defendants persuasively argue that because all federal claims are  [*48] subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim and/or on the basis of the individual Defendants' qualified immunity from suit, Plaintiff's state law claims likewise should be dismissed. This Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over any of Plaintiff's state law claims. The two state entities, OSHP and ODPS, are entitled to sovereign immunity to the extent that Plaintiff seeks monetary damages. See Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 121-122, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984)(Eleventh Amendment prohibits federal district court from exercising pendent jurisdiction to order state officials to conform their conduct to state law). Moreover, any state law claims against the individual defendants appear to be barred by the civil immunity granted under O.R.C. §9.86, unless and until the Court of Claims of Ohio has first determined that their immunity has been forfeited under O.R.C. §2743.02(F). See Haynes v. Marshall, 887 F.2d 700, 705 (6th Cir. 1989). Ultimately, because this Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction, it is neither necessary nor prudent to reach the merits of any of Plaintiff's state law claims, including but not limited to claims for fraudulent inducement, tortious interference,  [*49] breach of contract, and Plaintiff's verified petition for writ of mandamus. See also Alexander v. Ohio State Univ. College of Social Work, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91490, 2008 WL 4823081 (S.D. Ohio Nov. 3, 2008)(dismissing state law claim for damages based on alleged destruction of public records). 6

H. Declaratory Relief
Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment "pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2201 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57," in order to declare that Plaintiff's "appointment" date to the OSHP was on October 27, 2006 and not November 13, 2006. (Doc. 55 at ¶¶250-253). "The Declaratory Judgments Act reposes in the court discretion as to whether declaratory relief should be granted." Tower Realty v. City of East Detroit, 196 F.2d 710 (6th Cir. 1952). Use of the declaratory judgment procedure here is not warranted. As with most of Plaintiff's other concerns  [*50] with the terms and conditions of his employment, Plaintiff is free to seek resource under the CBA. See also Pittman v. Cuyahoga Valley Career Center, 451 F. Supp.2d 905, 909 n.2 (N.D. Ohio 2006)(plaintiff seeking monetary damages and equitable relief in the form of reinstate could not proceed under Declaratory Judgment Act).

IV. Conclusion and Recommendation
For all the reasons stated herein, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 56) be GRANTED and that this action be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE and stricken from the active docket.
