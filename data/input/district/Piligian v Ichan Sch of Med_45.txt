REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
STEWART D. AARON, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.
TO THE HONORABLE ANDREW L. CARTER, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:
Before the Court is a motion filed by Defendant, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai ("School" or "Defendant"), pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, seeking summary judgment dismissing the Complaint of Plaintiff, George Piligian, M.D. ("Plaintiff" or "Piligian"), in its entirety. (Not. of Mot., ECF No. 54.)
For the reasons set forth below, I respectfully recommend that Defendant's motion be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.1

FACTUAL BACKGROUND2

I. Plaintiff's Employment And Work At The Selikoff Center
Piligian, who is a board-certified physician licensed to practice medicine in [*2]  the State of New York, began working at the School in 1993 as a part-time Clinical Instructor in the Selikoff Center for Occupational Health (the "Selikoff Center"). (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF, ECF No. 64, ¶ 1; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF, ECF No. 73, ¶ 1.). The Selikoff Center is part of the division of Occupational Medicine within the Department of Preventive Medicine (the "Department"). (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF, ¶ 2; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 4.). In 2004, Piligian was promoted to Clinical Assistant Professor. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 3; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 3.).
During Plaintiff's employment, Dr. Philip Landrigan was the Chair of the Department. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶¶ 2, 10, 11; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 25.) From the time that Piligian began working at the School until January 2012, Dr. Steve Levin was Chief of Occupational Medicine and the co-director of the Selikoff Center. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 16.) Dr. Robin Herbert was the other co-director of the Selikoff Center until her retirement in 2009, at which time Dr. Jaime Szeinuk became co-director with Levin. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 17; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter [*3]  SOF ¶ 8.) In January 2012, following Levin's death, Dr. Roberto Lucchini became Chief of Occupational Medicine. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 18, 20; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 26.) Szeinuk remained the sole director of the Selikoff Center until he resigned in 2013. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 18; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 27.)

II. Plaintiff's Disability And Prior Accommodations
In or around 2005, Piligian started experiencing adverse health effects from looking at a computer screen. (See Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 10.) Piligian requested and received a larger computer monitor to assist with computer tasks, unrelated to data entry, as well as a dictation program. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 18; Piligian Tr., McEvoy Decl. Ex. 1, ECF No. 55-1, at 40-43.) Piligian testified that he spoke to various people regarding these accommodations, including Sharon Gluck, the clinic administrator, and one or two people in the information technology department. (Piligian Tr. at 41-43.) Piligian also recalled speaking with Dr. Levin regarding the inherent difficulties with voice dictation technology. (Id. at 43.)
Sometime in 2009 or 2010, the Selikoff Center began using EPIC, [*4]  a computer-based software program. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 36; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 19.) Thereafter, Piligian began to receive assistance with data entry in EPIC from his administrative assistant, Carlina Melendez. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶¶ 18, 20; Piligian Tr. at 49-51, 65.) Piligian testified that EPIC required data entry beyond just progress notes, including reporting to the state and C-4 forms,3 and that Melendez did that data entry for him based on paper charts that he completed or verbal instructions from him. (Piligian Tr. at 50.) Piligian further testified that Dr. Levin told him it was okay for Melendez to assist him with these data entry tasks. (Id. at 66.)
In 2011, Piligian was diagnosed with Convergence Insufficiency, an eye disorder that interferes with an individual's ability to maintain binocular function. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 11.) This condition manifested in certain symptoms after he focused for a long period of time on a computer screen, including vertigo, nausea and vomiting. (Id. ¶ 12.)

III. New Productivity Measures And Dr. Lucchini's Appointment
Sometime around 2011, Mount Sinai's Faculty Practice Associates imposed [*5]  new productivity standards on physicians in the School. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 22.) After Lucchini became Chief, in or around January 2012, the division of Occupational Medicine began implementing these productivity requirements. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶¶ 21, 25; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 28.) Plaintiff also alleges that Lucchini began enforcing deadlines for data entry, including for writing and completing patient reports. (Compl., ECF No. 1, ¶ 43.) Brian Schroeder, Administrative Manager of Occupational Medicine, developed the relevant productivity measures for the Department. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 26.) These measures included, among other things, work relative value units ("wRVUs"), which measure the relative level of time, skill, training and intensity to provide a given service, and charge lag, which is the period between the date of service and the date the service is invoiced. (Id. ¶¶ 26, 27, 31; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶¶ 117, 122, 123.)

IV. Plaintiff's Performance Appraisals
On August 3, 2012, a memorandum was provided to Piligian by Lucchini regarding Piligian's documentation practices and lateness to clinical sessions. (8/3/12 Memorandum, [*6]  McEvoy Decl. Ex. 1, ECF No. 55-1, at 73.4 ) In the memorandum, Lucchini noted that in March and July 2012, the School discovered that required documents were missing from charts for Piligian's patients, including C-4 forms for Workers' Compensation. (Id.; see also Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶¶ 35-38.) Lucchini reiterated the policy that Piligian must close his charts in EPIC within twenty-four hours of a patient encounter and submit all Workers' Compensation and billing forms within two days of a patient's visit, and warned Piligian that any further lateness or failure to submit appropriate documents would "result in immediate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment." (See 8/3/12 Mem.)
Nevertheless, in late November 2012, Szeinuk, who was Piligian's direct supervisor, provided Piligian with a favorable performance appraisal for calendar year 2012. (Piligian Decl. Ex. B, ECF No. 65-2.) In the area of "planning and organization," Piligian was given a "meets expectations," and in the area of "productivity," he was given an "exceeds expectations." (See id.) On or before March 18, 2013, Lucchini, who was not Piligian's direct supervisor, completed a separate Annual [*7]  Faculty Appointment Evaluation of Piligian for calendar year 2012. (Piligian Decl. Ex. Q, ECF No. 65-17; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 45.) In his evaluation, Lucchini gave Piligian an overall rating of "marginally meets expectations." (See Piligian Decl. Ex. Q.) Lucchini gave Piligian a 1, or "below expectations, for wRVUs.5 (See id. at 1.)

V. 2013 Program Merger And Requested Accommodations
In addition to the Selikoff Center, the division of Occupational Medicine division included the Clinical Center of Excellence for the World Trade Center Health Program, also referred to as the World Trade Center Monitoring Program (the "WTC Program"). (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 12; Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 55.) The Selikoff Center and the WTC Program merged in 2013. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 15.)
On February 24, 2013, Schroeder informed Piligian that, in order to diversify and balance his caseload, thirty to forty percent of Piligian's clinical time must be devoted to patients in the WTC Program. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 54.) Schroeder asked Piligian to meet with Julia Nicolaou, the WTC Program administrator, to adjust Piligian's schedule so that he could see WTC Program patients. [*8]  (Id. ¶ 56.) As of March 19, 2013, Piligian did not have the required certification to see patients in the WTC Program and needed to take an online course. (See Id. ¶¶ 61, 62, 66.) On May 15, 2013, Piligian emailed Nicolaou, Schroeder, Melendez and Dr. Aboaba Afilaka, the new Clinical Director for the Selikoff Center, regarding the status of his online coursework and requested paper forms to assist him with data entry for the WTC Program. (Id. ¶¶ 62, 65; Piligian Tr. at 149.) The parties dispute whether the School ever provided Piligian with these forms. (See Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 76; Piligian Tr. at 151.) By June 14, 2013, Piligian had completed the coursework and saw one patient in the WTC Program. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶ 70.)
On June 18, 2013, Piligian met with Lucchini to request assistance with data entry and to request accommodations regarding his visual deficiency. (Compl. ¶¶ 59-60; Answer, ECF No. 10, ¶¶ 59-60; see also Piligian Decl. Ex. W, ECF No. 66-3, ¶¶ 65-70.)6 During the meeting, Piligian advised Lucchini that his inability to focus on a computer screen for extended periods of time prevented him from completing the data entry requirements of the WTC Program software [*9]  without assistance. (Piligian Decl. ¶ 66.) Piligian also asserts that he requested accommodations for the data entry component of his duties, including the use of paper forms and an assistant,7 and that he asked Lucchini to suggest other reasonable accommodations to allow him to efficiently enter patient data into the computer system. (Id. ¶ 67; Piligian Tr. at 164.) Lucchini claims to have been "surprised to hear about [Piligian's] alleged vision problems" because this was the first time that Piligian had mentioned to him experiencing disability related issues with work on a computer. (See Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SOF ¶¶ 35-38.)

VI. Plaintiff's Non-Reappointment And Aftermath
Following the June 18, 2013, Lucchini emailed Nicolaou and Schroeder stating that Piligian "gets dizzy working on data entry for monitoring patients" and requested "to reduce the monitoring component to his schedule."8 (Piligian Decl. Ex. W, ECF No. 66-3.) Lucchini then asked them to let him know "what [was] feasible." (Id.) Schroeder responded, saying that he was confused because he thought that Lucchini would be providing Piligian with a "non-reappointment letter as of June 30." (Id.) The next day, June 19, [*10]  2013, Nicolaou responded that she told Piligian she would provide him with paper forms to fill out during the patient exams and that his patient coordinator "would sit with him to complete the documentation . . . after the patient leaves." (Id.) Lucchini then responded as follows: "Yesterday I told [Piligian] this is his duty with no help from patient coordinator. If he cannot do it there is no other job." (Id.) One day later, on June 20, 2013, Lucchini (along with Landrigan) signed a letter to Piligian giving Piligian "advance notice" that he would not be reappointed to the faculty at the School and that his current term would end on November 30, 2013. (Piligian Decl. Ex. X, ECF No. 66-4.)

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On March 17, 2017, Plaintiff filed his Complaint in this case. Plaintiff's Complaint alleges eight claims: (1) discrimination based on disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") (First Claim); (2) retaliation in violation of the ADA (Second Claim); (3) discrimination based on disability in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (the "Rehabilitation Act") (Third Claim); (4) retaliation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act (Fourth Claim); (5) discrimination [*11]  based on disability in violation of the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL") (Fifth Claim); (6) retaliation in violation of NYSHRL (Sixth Claim); (7) discrimination based on disability in violation of New York City Human Rights Law ("NYCHRL") (Seventh Claim); and (8) retaliation in violation of NYCHRL (Eighth Claim). (Compl. ¶¶ 75-118.) Following completion of discovery, Defendant filed the instant motion for summary judgment.

LEGAL STANDARDS

I. Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). When analyzing a summary judgment motion, the court "cannot try issues of fact; it can only determine whether there are issues to be tried." Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 36-37 (2d Cir. 1994) (quotation and citation omitted). A genuine dispute exists where "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party," while a fact is material if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
The moving party bears the initial burden of producing evidence on each material element of its claim or defense demonstrating that it is entitled to relief. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The evidence on each [*12]  material element must be sufficient to entitle the movant to relief as a matter of law. Vt. Teddy Bear Co. v. 1-800 Beargram Co., 373 F.3d 241, 244 (2d Cir. 2004). Put another way, the movant bears the initial burden of demonstrating "the absence of a genuine issue of material fact," and, if satisfied, the burden then shifts to the non-movant to present "evidence sufficient to satisfy every element of the claim." Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 137 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323). To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-movant "must come forward with 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (quoting former Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [non-movant's] position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant]." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
In determining whether there exists a genuine dispute as to a material fact, the Court is "required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought." Johnson, 680 F.3d at 236 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Court's job is not to "weigh the evidence or resolve issues of fact." Lucente v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 310 F.3d 243, 254 (2d Cir. 2002) (citation omitted); see also Hayes v. N.Y. City Dep't of Corr., 84 F.3d 614, 619 (2d Cir. 1996) ("In applying th[e] [summary judgment] standard, the court should [*13]  not weigh evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses."). "Assessments of credibility and choices between conflicting versions of the events are matters for the jury, not for the court on summary judgment." Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 553 (2d Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).

II. Disability Discrimination Under The ADA, Rehabilitation Act And NYSHRL
Title I of the ADA provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). "Discrimination claims under the ADA may be brought under a theory of adverse employment action or of failure to provide reasonable accommodation." Berger v. New York City Police Dep't, 304 F. Supp. 3d 360, 368 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (citing McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125-26 (2d Cir. 2013)). Claims brought under the Rehabilitation Act and the NYSHRL are analyzed under the same standards. See Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F.3d 611, 617 (2d Cir. 1999) (Rehabilitation Act claims are analytically "identical" to ADA claims); McDonnell v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 618 F. App'x 697, 698 (2d Cir. 2015) ("A similar standard" applies to discrimination claims brought under the NYSHRL and the ADA).
To make out a prima facie case for disability discrimination based on an adverse employment action, a plaintiff must show by a preponderance of [*14]  the evidence that: "(1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) he suffered adverse employment action because of his disability." Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006); see also Quadir v. New York State Dep't of Labor, No. 13-CV-03327 (JPO), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84632, 2016 WL 3633406, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2016), aff'd, 691 F. App'x 674 (2d Cir. 2017) (applying this test to claims under Rehabilitation Act); Nelson v. City of New York, No. 11-CV-02732 (JPO), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117742, 2013 WL 4437224, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 2013) (applying this test to claims under the NYSHRL). Under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and the NYSHRL, "a plaintiff alleging a claim of employment discrimination [must] prove that discrimination was the but-for cause of any adverse employment action." Natofsky v. City of New York, 921 F.3d 337, 348 (2d Cir. 2019).
On the other hand, because the ADA defines discrimination to include the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, see 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A), a plaintiff asserting a claim for discrimination based on a failure to accommodate need only show that "(1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) his employer is a covered entity; (3) he could perform the essential functions of his job with an accommodation; and (4) the defendants refused to provide such an accommodation despite being on notice." Fox v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 918 F.3d 65, 73 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 96-97 (2d Cir. 2009)); see also Nazario v. Promed Pers. Servs. NY Inc., No. 15-CV-06989 (LGS), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94877, 2017 WL 2664202, at *5 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. June 19, 2017) ("The failure to accommodate provision in § 12112(b)(5)(A) deals with [*15]  state of mind implicitly by excusing the adoption of accommodations that are unreasonable or would cause undue hardship."); accord Peebles v. Potter, 354 F.3d 761, 766 (8th Cir. 2004) ("a claim against an employer for failing to reasonably accommodate a disabled employee does not turn on the employer's intent or actual motive"); Punt v. Kelly Servs., 862 F.3d 1040, 1047-48 (10th Cir. 2017) (failure to accommodate claims do not require evidence of discriminatory intent).
Despite these separate frameworks, the two types of claims overlap when a plaintiff asserts that an adverse employment action is tied to an employer's failure to accommodate, such that the employer's failure to accommodate becomes evidence of discriminatory intent. See, e.g., McMillan, 711 F.3d at 126 ; McBride, 583 F.3d at 102 ("an employer's failure to make a reasonable accommodation, particularly when coupled with a refusal to engage in a sufficient interactive process, makes out a prima facie case of disability discrimination where the plaintiff has also made a sufficient showing that, inter alia, she is qualified for the position at issue."); accord Kells v. Sinclair Buick-GMC Truck, Inc., 210 F.3d 827, 834 (8th Cir. 2000) ("Failing to provide an employee with reasonable accommodations can tend to prove that the employer also acted adversely against the employee because of the individual's disability.").
The traditional McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting [*16]  framework, which is "used to weed out non-viable claims of discrimination based on circumstantial evidence[,]" is "not helpful" in this context. McMillan, 711 F.3d at 129 (pretext not an issue when employer disciplined employee because of tardiness, which parties agreed was direct result of employee's disability); accord Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Dolgencorp, LLC, 899 F.3d 428, 435 (6th Cir. 2018) ("[A] company may not illegitimately deny an employee a reasonable accommodation to a general policy and use that same policy as a neutral basis for firing him."). Some courts have analyzed these claims as failure to accommodate claims, though the usual framework does not account for the necessary link between the failure to accommodate and the adverse employment action. Thus, in Natofsky, the Second Circuit held that a plaintiff asserting a claim based both on an adverse employment action and a failure to accommodate also must demonstrate "the connections" between (1) an employer's failure to accommodate a disability, (2) the plaintiff's performance deficiencies, and (3) the adverse employment action. Natofsky, 921 F.3d at 352.
As with standalone failure to accommodate claims, the plaintiff first "bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow [him] [*17]  to perform the essential functions of [his] employment." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 126; see also Wu v. Metro. Transportation Auth., No. 18-CV-06543 (GHW), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22641, 2020 WL 615626, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2020). If the plaintiff meets that burden, "the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the employee's proposed accommodation would result in an undue hardship." Scalera v. Electrograph Sys., Inc., 848 F. Supp. 2d 352, 360 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 273 (2d Cir. 2006)).
While "[t]he ADA envisions an 'interactive process' by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated[,]" Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3), the failure of an employer to engage in such process is not an independent violation of the ADA and does not relieve a plaintiff of his burden to demonstrate that some accommodation was possible. See McBride, 583 F.3d at 101; see also Nazario, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94877, 2017 WL 2664202, at *7. Nonetheless, if the plaintiff has met his burden to show that accommodation was possible, an employer's failure to engage in a sufficient interactive process may constitute prima facie evidence of discrimination because of disability. See McBride, 583 F.3d at 101.

III. Disability Discrimination Under The NYCHRL
Claims under the NYCHRL must be analyzed "separately and independently from any federal and state law claims" and construed "broadly in favor of discrimination plaintiffs, to the extent that such a construction is reasonably possible." Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am. Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 109 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal citations and quotations [*18]  omitted). To state a claim for discrimination under the NYCHRL, a plaintiff need only show that he was treated "less well" at least in part because of his protected status. Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110. Moreover, "New York courts have held that the failure to engage in an interactive process is itself a violation of the [NYCHRL] and gives rise to an independent claim." Stuart v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., No. 14-CV-04252 (JMF), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106155, 2015 WL 4760184, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 12, 2015) (citing cases).

IV. Retaliation Under The ADA Or Rehabilitation Act
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must establish: "(1) participation in a protected activity; (2) that the defendant knew of the protected activity; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Hicks, 593 F.3d at 164 (quoting Jute v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 173 (2d Cir. 2005)). A plaintiff claiming retaliation under one of these statutes must prove that his protected activity was a "but-for cause" of the adverse employment action. See University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013); see also Natofsky, 921 F.3d at 349.
Federal retaliation claims are analyzed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Nieblas-Love, 165 F. Supp. 3d at 65-66, 74-75; see also Kemp v. Metro-N. R.R., No. 04-CV-09926 (RWS), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43568, 2007 WL 1741256, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. June 14, 2007), aff'd, 316 F. App'x 25 (2d Cir. 2009). "A causal connection in retaliation claims can be shown either '(1) indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory [*19]  treatment, or through other circumstantial evidence such as disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in similar conduct; or (2) directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the plaintiff by the defendant.'" Littlejohn, 795 F.3d at 319 (quoting Gordon v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000)). If the plaintiff sustains his initial burden of demonstrating a prima facie case, "a presumption of retaliation arises." Hicks, 593 F.3d at 164 (quoting Jute, 420 F.3d at 173).
At the second step of the McDonnell Douglas analysis, the burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption of retaliation "by 'articulat[ing] a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action.'" Ya-Chen Chen v. City Univ. of New York, 805 F.3d 59, 70 (2d Cir. 2015). "If the defendant provides such an explanation, 'the presumption of retaliation dissipates.'" Id. (quoting Jute, 420 F.3d at 173). At the third and final step of the analysis, "[t]he plaintiff must . . . come forward with [proof that the] non-retaliatory reason is a mere pretext for retaliation." Misas v. N. Shore-Long Island Jewish Health Sys., No. 14-CV-08787 (ALC) (DCF), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64379, 2017 WL 1535112, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 27, 2017) (internal quotation omitted). To satisfy this burden, "the plaintiff must prove 'that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action,'" Ya-Chen Chen, 805 F.3d at 70 (quoting Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 351, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013)), and "not simply a 'substantial' or 'motivating' factor in [*20]  the employer's decision." See Zann Kwan v. Andalex Grp. LLC, 737 F.3d 834, 845 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing Nassar, 570 U.S. at 348, 360). "A plaintiff may prove that retaliation was a but-for cause of an adverse employment action by demonstrating weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate, nonretaliatory reasons for its action. From such discrepancies, a reasonable juror could conclude that the explanations were a pretext for a prohibited reason." Id. at 846 (citations omitted). "'[B]ut-for' causation does not require proof that retaliation was the only cause of the employer's action, but only that the adverse action would not have occurred in the absence of the retaliatory motive." Id.

V. Retaliation Under The NYSHRL And NYCHRL
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the NYSHRL, a plaintiff must establish: (1) that he participated in an activity protected by the NYSHRL, (2) that his participation was known to his employer, (3) that his employer thereafter subjected him to a materially adverse employment action, and (4) that there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Benzinger v. Lukoil Pan Americas LLC & Litasco S.A., No. 16-CV-08533 (PAE), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48688, 2020 WL 1322478, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2020) (citing Kaytor v. Elec. Boat Corp., 609 F.3d 537, 552 (2d Cir. 2010)). "The burden of proof at the prima facie stage has been characterized as de minimis [*21] ." Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
"The NYCHRL imposes an identical standard to that of the NYSHRL, except that the plaintiff need not prove any adverse employment action; instead, he must prove that something happened that would be reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in protected activity." Benzinger, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48688, 2020 WL 1322478, at *20 (internal citation, quotation marks and alterations omitted). "[T]o prevail on a retaliation claim under the NYCHRL, [a] plaintiff must show that [he] took an action opposing [his] employer's discrimination, . . . and that, as a result, the employer engaged in conduct that was reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in such action[.]" Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 112 (quoting N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(7); citing Albunio v. City of New York, 16 N.Y.3d 472, 479, 947 N.E.2d 135, 922 N.Y.S.2d 244 (N.Y. 2011); Williams v. New York City Hous. Auth., 61 A.D.3d 62, 70, 872 N.Y.S.2d 27 (1st Dep't 2009)). Under the NYCHRL the protected activity need only have been "a motivating factor" in the adverse action. Ottoson v. SMBC Leasing & Fin., Inc., No. 13-CV-01521 (JPO), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31115, 2020 WL 881992, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2020) (citing Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 115).

DISCUSSION

I. Overview Of Plaintiff's Claims And Defendant's Motion
Plaintiff alleges that the School accommodated his disability until around the time that the Selikoff Center and the WTC Program began to merge. (Compl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 41.) Plaintiff alleges that, because many physicians left the Selikoff Center following the merger, he faced an increased workload and increased [*22]  data entry requirements. (Id. ¶¶ 43, 44, 51.) Plaintiff asserts that the School refused to provide him with any commensurate accommodation, but does not claim that he requested or was denied any accommodation, except with respect to the WTC Program, as discussed below. (Id. ¶ 51.) However, Plaintiff appears to contend that he could not meet the deadlines for data entry or meet certain productivity measures without further accommodations and that the School should have provided him with additional accommodations because it knew about his disability. (See id. ¶¶ 41-51; see also Piligian Tr. at 99-100.)
Separately, Plaintiff alleges that the School refused to continue to provide him with accommodations for work in the WTC Program, including paper data forms and an assistant to help with data entry, a task that he contends was even more burdensome because of the WTC Program's software program. (Compl. ¶¶ 52, 54, 56.) Plaintiff also alleges that because of the increased data entry requirements in the WTC program, he was able to spend less time with patients in either clinic. (Id. ¶ 53.)
In moving for summary judgment, Defendant does not contest that it is subject to the ADA, that Plaintiff [*23]  suffers from a disability or that Plaintiff was able to perform the essential functions of his job with or without an accommodation. (See Def.'s Mem., ECF No. 61, at 14-20.) Rather, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims based on his non-reappointment because Plaintiff has failed to show that the decision not to reappoint him was because of his disability. (Id. at 15-16.) Defendant argues that, at the time the decision was made, the relevant decisionmakers lacked knowledge of Plaintiff's disability and, thus, the decision could not have been on that basis. (See id. at 20-23.) Defendant also argues that, even if Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the decision not to reappoint him was based on a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, i.e., his failure to meet productivity standards. (Id. at 17-18.) In addition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to show a failure to accommodate because Plaintiff received every accommodation he requested. (See id. at 14-23.) With respect to Plaintiff's retaliation claims, Defendant argues that a request for a reasonable accommodation is not a protected activity under the NYSHRL or NYCHRL and that, with [*24]  respect to federal law, Plaintiff has not established a causal connection between his request for an accommodation and the decision not to reappoint him. (Id. at 23-25.)
The Court first addresses Defendant's argument as to its notice of Plaintiff's disability. Next, the Court considers Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims. Finally, the Court considers Plaintiff's claims of retaliation.

II. Defendant's Argument As To Notice
As an initial matter, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish that his non-reappointment was because of his disability because he cannot show "that the individuals who made the decision not to reappoint him had knowledge of his alleged disability before that decision was made[.]" (Def.'s Mem. at 15.) Other courts have granted summary judgment under similar circumstances. See, e.g., Francis v. Namdor, Inc., No. 15-CV-00745 (RJD) (CLP), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134251, 2017 WL 3634601, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2017) (granting summary judgment when undisputed that defendants decided to fire plaintiff before they knew about claimed disability). However, here, unlike in the cases cited by Defendant, there are factual disputes as to who made the decision not to reappoint Plaintiff, when that decision was made and what knowledge the decisionmakers had at the [*25]  time of the decision.
Defendant asserts that the decision not to reappoint Plaintiff was made "[b]y June 18, 2013[,]" citing the email from Schroeder to Lucchini on that date, which Defendant contends demonstrates that the decision not to reappoint Piligian already had been made. (Def.'s Mem. at 10 n.16; see also Piligian Decl. Ex. W, ECF No. 66-3.) However, Schroder's email is in response to an email from Lucchini in which Lucchini wrote that Plaintiff has requested to reduce the monitoring (or WTC Program) component to his schedule, and asked Schroeder and Nicolaou what was "feasible." (See Piligian Decl. Ex. W.) This email suggests that the School had not yet reached a decision as to Piligian's reappointment. Coupled with the fact that the School has not identified a specific date when the decision allegedly was made, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the decision not to reappoint Plaintiff was made after June 18, 2013.
In addition, there is evidence in the record that others who worked in the Selikoff Center were aware of Plaintiff's vision problems since at least 2010. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶¶ 13-16.) Thus, although Lucchini denied having knowledge of Plaintiff's [*26]  disability at the time he made the non-reappointment decision, a reasonable factfinder could find otherwise. Moreover, even if the decision was made before June 18, 2013, there also is evidence in the record that others who were involved in the decision not to reappoint Plaintiff were aware of his disability before that date. For example, there is evidence in the record that Schroeder was aware of Plaintiff's eye condition at least as of May 2013, if not before. (See, e.g., Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶ 62.) While Defendant asserts that the decision not to reappoint Plaintiff was made by Landrigan and Lucchini based, in part, on information from Schroeder (Def.'s Mem. at 9-10), Landrigan testified that he made the decision based on a recommendation by Piligian's "line supervisors[,]" including Lucchini, as well as Schroeder. (Landrigan Tr. at 83.) Similarly, Lucchini testified that the decision was made by him, Landrigan and Schroeder. (Lucchini Tr. at 177.) Thus, there is ample evidence that Schroeder was involved in the decision.
For these reasons, the Court finds that Defendant has not demonstrated the absence of a genuine issue of fact as to its knowledge of Plaintiff's disability [*27]  at the time the decision was made not to reappoint him.

III. Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination Claims (First, Third, Fifth And Seventh Claims)
Defendant argues that, even if Plaintiff has stated a prima facie case of discrimination, the School has shown a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination and Plaintiff has failed to show evidence of pretext. (Def.'s Mem. at 17-19.) However, this argument does not address how the School's alleged failure to accommodate Plaintiff could itself be evidence of discriminatory intent. Plaintiff argues that the School failed to accommodate him to enable him to meet the deadlines for data entry and documentation and productivity standards that the School began to enforce in or around 2012.9 (See Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶¶ 13-14; Piligian Tr. at 99-102.) Plaintiff also contends that the School denied him certain accommodations for work in the WTC Program, including paper charts and an assistant. (See Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶¶ 56, 94) In addition, according to Lucchini, Plaintiff asked to reduce the monitoring component to his schedule, an apparent request to reduce the percentage of WTC Program patients that he was [*28]  required to see. (Piligian Decl. Ex. W.)
The contemporaneous emails sent by Lucchini and Nicolaou on June 18 and June 19, 2013 alone create an issue of fact as to whether the School engaged in an interactive process regarding Plaintiff's WTC Program accommodation requests. On June 18, 2013, Lucchini acknowledged that Plaintiff requested an accommodation — i.e., "to reduce the monitoring component to his schedule" — and Lucchini then asked Schroeder and Nicolaou what was "feasible." (See Piligian Decl. Ex. W.) Nicolaou responded the following day stating that a patient coordinator could "sit with" Plaintiff "to complete the documentation" after the patient leaves, which appears to refer to other possible accommodations regarding data entry and documentation requirements. (See id.), Then, Lucchini responded, "[y]esterday I told [Plaintiff] this is his duty with no help from patient coordinator. If he cannot do it there is no other job and he can leave." (See id.) It is unclear from the record before the Court what "duty" Lucchini is referring to in this email, or why his initial request to Schroeder regarding what was feasible in terms of the monitoring component of Piligian's schedule [*29]  no longer was being considered. At a minimum, this exchange of emails is evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the School refused to provide at least some accommodations to Plaintiff. In addition, there is evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff's inability to meet these requirements was connected to his disability. (See, e.g., Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Counter SOF ¶¶ 11-13; Piligian Tr. at 103-04.) Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has set forth a prima facie case of disability discrimination.
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff cannot state a disability discrimination claim based on failure to accommodate because he received every accommodation he requested. (See Def.'s Mem. at 21-23.) As set forth above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has adduced evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the School refused to provide at least some accommodations to Plaintiff. Moreover, the fact that Plaintiff did not specifically request other accommodations is not dispositive. If an employee's disability "is obvious—which is to say, if the employer knew or reasonably should have known that the employee was disabled[,]" [*30]  the "employer has a duty reasonably to accommodate [the] employee's disability[.]" Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir. 2008). Thus, although the employee has not requested a specific accommodation, the employer must engage in an "interactive process" to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated." Id. The Court finds that Plaintiff has adduced some evidence from which a reasonable jury could determine that the School knew or reasonably should have known that he was disabled and that the School failed to engage in the necessary interactive process to at least assess the possibility of additional accommodations before deciding not to reappoint Plaintiff. See Lareau v. Nw. Med. Ctr., No. 17-CV-00081, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112374, 2019 WL 2929793, at **7-8 (D. Vt. July 8, 2019) (medical center on notice that stress and tight deadlines were problematic for plaintiff, despite accommodations, should have assessed possibility of additional accommodations before terminating her employment) (citing Brady, 531 F.3d at 135); see also Scorsonelli v. Madison Dentistry, P.C., No. 18-CV-04269 (JMF), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 197976, 2019 WL 6032787, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 2019) ("The law requires employers to engage employees they know or should know suffer from a disability in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation.").
For these reasons, I recommend that Defendant's motion be denied as to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims.

IV. Retaliation Claims

A. Federal [*31]  Retaliation Claims (Second And Fourth Claims)
Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted with respect to Plaintiff's retaliation claims under federal law because "the individuals involved in the decision not to reappoint him did not know of any request for an accommodation before making that decision" and, thus, the decision could not have been retaliatory. (Def.'s Mem. at 24.) As set forth above, the Court finds that there are genuine issues of material fact as to the date the decision was made not to appoint Plaintiff and what the decisionmakers knew about Plaintiff's disability at that time.
At a minimum, Plaintiff presents evidence that he requested accommodations for work at the WTC Program, including during the June 18, 2013 meeting with Lucchini, and that shortly thereafter he received notice of his non-reappointment. "[A] plaintiff can raise an inference of retaliatory intent 'by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse employment action.'" Seitz v. New York State, No. 18-CV-04149 (PKC) (LB), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169680, 2019 WL 4805257, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2019) (quoting Gorman-Bakos v. Cornell Co-op Extension of Schenectady Cty., 252 F.3d 545, 554 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks, brackets and citation omitted)). While the temporal proximity must be "very close[,]" the mere days at issue here [*32]  are close enough to raise the necessary inference. Knight v. City of New York, 303 F. Supp. 2d 485, 497 (S.D.N.Y. 2004), aff'd, 147 F. App'x 221 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001)); cf. Jones v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., No. 09-CV-04815, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47128, 2012 WL 1116906, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2012) ("District courts in this circuit consistently have found that an intervening period of more than two to three months is insufficient to establish a causal connection through temporal proximity alone."). To the extent that Defendant argues that the decision not to reappoint Plaintiff was part of a continuing course of conduct that began prior to any protected activity (see Def.'s Mem. at 16-17), the Court finds that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the August 2012 memorandum or Lucchini's evaluation are enough to establish a continuing course of conduct, particularly considering Szeinuk's more favorable evaluation in the interim.
For these reasons, I recommend that Defendant's motion be denied as to Plaintiff's federal retaliation claims.

B. Retaliation Claims Under The NYSHRL And NYCHRL (Sixth And Eighth Claims)
Defendant argues that summary judgment should be granted in its favor on Plaintiff's retaliation claims under state law because, in contrast to federal law, a request for a reasonable accommodation is not a protected activity under the NYSHRL or the NYCHRL. (Def.'s Mem. at 23-24.) [*33]  Plaintiff argues that an accommodation request is protected activity. (Pl.'s Mem. at 25.) Plaintiff does not cite any cases directly on point, but instead argues that NYSHRL claims mirror federal law and that a broad interpretation of the NYCHRL supports his reading of that statute. (See id.)
The NYSHRL makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee because he "has opposed any practices forbidden under this article or because . . . [he] has filed a complaint, testified or assisted in any proceeding under this article." N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(7). Thus, "[t]he term 'protected activity' refers to action taken to protest or oppose statutorily prohibited discrimination." Benzinger, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48688, 2020 WL 1322478, at *15 (internal citation omitted). "An employee engages in a protected activity when she complains of an employment practice that [he] reasonably believes violates the law." Id. (quoting Mayers v. Emigrant Bancorp, Inc., 796 F. Supp. 2d 434, 448 (S.D.N.Y. 2011)).
Similarly, the NYCHRL prohibits employers from "retaliat[ing] or discriminat[ing] in any manner against any person because such person has . . . opposed any practice forbidden under rules of construction, New York courts have broadly interpreted the NYCHRL's retaliation provisions." Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 112 (citing Albunio, 16 N.Y.3d at 477-78). "The New York Court of Appeals has held that 'oppos[ing] [*34]  any practice' can include situations where a person, before the retaliatory conduct occurred, merely 'made clear [his] disapproval of [the defendant's] discrimination by communicating to [him], in substance, that [he] thought [his] treatment of [the victim] was wrong." Id. (citing Albunio, 16 N.Y.3d at 479.) Nonetheless, in order to state a retaliation claim there must be some evidence that the plaintiff opposed or complained of unlawful discrimination. See Mi-Kyung Cho v. Young Bin Café, 42 F. Supp. 3d 495, 508 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) ("Protected activity under either the NYSHRL or NYCHRL does not include the entire gamut of all complaints concerning employment practices, but rather is limited to actions which complain [of] or oppose the discriminatory practices prohibited under these statutes."). Thus, courts have distinguished between requests for accommodation in the first instance, which do not constitute protected activity, and complaints about or opposition to the denial of such requests, which may constitute protected activity. See, e.g., D'Amico v. City of New York, 159 A.D.3d 558, 558-59, 73 N.Y.S.3d 540 (1st Dep't 2018) ("Neither plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation nor his filing of an internal workers' compensation claim constitutes protected activities for purposes of the State and City [Human Rights Laws]."); Brook v. Overseas Media, Inc., 69 A.D.3d 444, 445, 893 N.Y.S.2d 37 (1st Dep't 2010) ("Even when the complaint is [*35]  liberally construed to allege that plaintiff's employment was terminated in retaliation for requesting an accommodation for her disability, it this chapter." N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(7)."In accordance with the Restoration Act's10 rules of construction, New York courts have broadly interpreted the NYCHRL's retaliation provisions." Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 112 (citing Albunio,16 N.Y.3d at 477-78). "The New York Court of Appeals has held that 'oppos[ing] any practice' can include situations where a person, before the retaliatory conduct occurred, merely 'made clear [his] disapproval of [the defendant's] discrimination by communicating to [him], in substance, that [he] thought [his] treatment of [the victim] was wrong." Id. (citing Albunio, 16 N.Y.3d at 479.) Nonetheless, in order to state a retaliation claim there must be some evidence that the plaintiff opposed or complained of unlawful discrimination. See Mi-Kyung Cho v. Young Bin Café, 42 F. Supp. 3d 495, 508 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)("Protected activity under either the NYSHRL or NYCHRL does not include the entire gamut of all complaints concerning employment practices, but rather is limited to actions which complain [of] or oppose the discriminatory practices prohibited under these statutes."). Thus, courts have distinguished between requests for accommodation in the first instance, which do not constitute [*36]  protected activity, and complaints about or opposition to the denial of such requests, which may constitute protected activity.See,e.g., D'Amico v. City of New York, 159 A.D.3d 558,558-59, 73 N.Y.S.3d 540 (1st Dep't 2018) ("Neither plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation nor his filing of an internal workers' compensation claim constitutes protected activities for purposes of the State and City [Human Rights Laws]."); Brook v. Overseas Media, Inc., 69 A.D.3d 444, 445, 893 N.Y.S.2d 37 (1st Dep't 2010) ("Even when the complaint is liberally construed to allege that plaintiff's employment was terminated in retaliation for requesting an accommodation for her disability, it does not state a cause of action because it fails to allege that she opposed her employer's discriminatory failure to make reasonable accommodation."); Serdans v. New York & Presbyterian Hosp., 112 A.D.3d 449, 450-51, 977 N.Y.S.2d 196 (1st Dep't 2013) ("Plaintiff's complaint about defendant's alleged failure to implement the parties' agreement to accommodate her disability (as distinct from her initial request for an accommodation) does constitute a protected activity for purposes of her State and City HRL claims of retaliation."); but see Scorsonelli, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 197976, 2019 WL 6032787, at *1 (finding, in light of broad interpretation of NYCHRL, that reasonable jury could conclude that plaintiff's repeated daily requests for leave constituted protected activity under NYCHRL).
Here, Plaintiff does not allege that he [*37]  was retaliated against for complaining about or opposing the denial of a requested accommodation, but only that he was retaliated for making such a request.11 Thus, the Court recommends that his NYSHRL claim (Sixth Claim) be dismissed. The Court separately considers Plaintiff's NYCHRL retaliation claim under the liberal standard applied to claims under that statute. The Court is cognizant that, in 2018, the New York City Council amended the NYCHRL, effective November 11, 2019, to expressly state that a request for a reasonable accommodation is a protected activity. See New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 129 Int. No. 799 (2019) (amending § 8-107(7)). Neither party addresses whether this provision applies retroactively to Plaintiff's claim. Nonetheless, the Court considers the impact of the amendment on the interpretation of the NYCHRL.
"In determining whether statutory enactments should be given retroactive effect, there are two axioms of statutory interpretation." Nelson, 87 A.D.3d at 997. First, "[a]mendments are presumed to have prospective application unless the Legislature's preference for retroactivity is explicitly stated or clearly indicated." Id. Second, "remedial legislation should be given retroactive effect [*38]  in order to effectuate its beneficial purpose[.]" Id. (internal citations omitted). "These axioms are helpful guideposts, but the reach of the statute ultimately becomes a matter of judgment made upon review of the legislative goal." Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). "Other factors to consider include whether the Legislature has made a specific pronouncement about retroactive effect or conveyed a sense of urgency; whether the statute was designed to rewrite an unintended judicial interpretation; and whether the enactment itself reaffirms a legislative judgment about what the law in question should be." Id. (citation omitted).
Here, the Court finds that the amendment applies only to conduct on or after the effective date. First, while the Committee Report notes that the bill would "affirm and clarify that, rather than the protections being limited to opposing an unlawful discriminatory act, employees are indeed protected from retaliation when they request a reasonable accommodation[,]" the text of the law does not include a retroactivity provision and states that it "amends" rather than clarifies the Administrative Code. See June 18, 2018 Comm. Report, at 4, available [*39]  at https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3474318&GUID=7D4A5818-4021-4732-85CD-33E55A34B282&Options=ID|Text|&Search=8-107; accord Palmer v. Cook, 65 Misc. 3d 374, 388, 108 N.Y.S.3d 297 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2019) (finding that NYCHRL amendment making caregiver status protected class applied only to conduct on or after effective date when neither statute nor legislature indicated amendment was retroactive). Thus, the Court recommends that Plaintiff's retaliation claim under the NYCHRL (Eighth Claim) be dismissed.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully recommend that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Specifically, I recommend that Defendant's motion be granted only with respect to Plaintiff's Sixth and Eighth Claims and that the motion otherwise be denied.
