MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
CASTEL, U.S.D.J.
Plaintiff Wanna Berry-Mayes is the administrator of the estate of her deceased uncle, Andre Berry. Andre Berry was a deaf man who communicated using sign language and had, at most, limited speaking abilities. In the final years of his life, his serious medical conditions included end-stage renal disease, diabetes, hypertension and HIV. In 2012 and 2013, he was treated several times at Lincoln Hospital and Jacobi Hospital, both of which are located in the Bronx and are part of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (the "HHC"). Andre Berry died at his home in November 2013 at the age [*2]  of 52.
The administrator of Mr. Berry's estate brings this action against the HHC, asserting asserts that during his visits to Jacobi Hospital and Lincoln Hospital, the HHC failed to provide him with the reasonable accommodations necessary to facilitate communication, specifically including a sign-language interpreter. The administrator brings claims under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. (the "ADA"), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. L. § 290 et seq. (the "NYSHRL") and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-101, et seq. (the "NYCHRL"). She seeks a declaratory judgment stating that the HHC failed to provide reasonable accommodation to Andre Berry under these statutes, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.
Discovery in this case is now closed. The HHC and Berry-Mayes have both filed motions for summary judgment. (Docket # 31, 43.) For the reasons explained, the Court concludes that no reasonable jury could find that the HHC violated the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. Separately, Mr. Berry's administrator has not identified a "useful purpose" for the entry of declaratory judgment and has not come forward with the evidence of deliberate indifference [*3]  required to award compensatory damages under federal law. The HHC's motion for summary judgment is therefore granted as to both federal claims, and the plaintiff's summary judgment motion is denied. Because the two federal claims are dismissed, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims brought under the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL.
BACKGROUND.
Denise Berry is the sister of Andre Berry, and she testified in a deposition about her brother's disabilities and certain observations that she made during his hospitalization. Plaintiff Wanna Berry-Mayes is Denise Berry's daughter and Andre Berry's niece, and is the administrator of Andre Berry's estate. The Court refers to these three individuals as "Andre," "Denise" and "Berry-Mayes."
Andre, who was deaf, suffered from several serious medical conditions, including end-stage renal disease, diabetes, hypertension and HIV. (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 3, 4; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 3, 4; Def. 56.1 ¶ 20; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 20.) He died in his home of hypertensive cardiovascular disease on November 5, 2013, at the age of 52.1 (Pl. 56.1 ¶ 5; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 5; Def. 56.1 ¶ 23; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 23.) On several occasions in 2012 and 2013, [*4]  he received medical treatment at Lincoln Hospital and Jacobi Hospital, both of which are part of the HHC system. (Pl. 56.1 ¶ 4; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 4.)
Andre knew American Sign Language ("ASL") and communicated using ASL. (Pl. 56.1 ¶ 15; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 15; Def. 56.1 ¶ 6; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 6.) The defendant asserts that Andre "could read lips" and often communicated through lip reading, whereas the plaintiff contends that Andre's lip-reading skills were "at most" limited. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 3; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 3.) Denise testified in her deposition that Andre could read lips when the speaker faced him and enunciated clearly, and it is undisputed that the members of his family did not communicate with him through ASL. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 5, 7; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 5, 7.)
Throughout 2012 and 2013, Andre received medical treatment at Lincoln Hospital, and, in October 2013, received treatment at Jacobi Hospital. Both hospitals are located in the Bronx and are part of the HHC system. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 25; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 25.) The HHC has contracts with vendors that provide sign-language interpreters, either in person or through vide-remote interpretation ("VRI"). (Def. 56.1 ¶ 30; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 30.)
Throughout [*5]  the course of Andre's treatment, doctors and other staff members at Jacobi Hospital and Lincoln Hospital made notations in Andre's medical records about his hearing impairment and communication difficulties, including observations as to the use of an interpreter, the functioning of his hearing aid and his willingness to communicate. As Berry-Mayes notes, staff at Lincoln observed that Andre "has severe hearing impairment, requires monitor with sign language to adequately communicate," and that "communication is extremely difficult" due to his severe hearing impairment. (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 16-22; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 16-22.) In October 2013, when Andre was receiving treatment at Jacobi Hospital, employees made similar notations, observing, among other things, that Andre "usually needs sign language help," had a "difficulty/inability to speak" and "inability to communicate." (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 23-28; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 23-28.)
Berry-Mayes relies heavily on the absence of an interpreter's signature on various forms as evidence that Andre was not provided with adequate access to an interpreter. As will be discussed below, the HHC has come forward with evidence that it frequently provided a sign language [*6]  interpreter to Andre, particularly with regard to interactions before and after surgeries. There is no evidence that Andre ever requested an interpreter, and, on occasion, hospital staff arranged for an interpreter even though Andre requested that one not be used. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 501, 506-07; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 501, 506-07.)
At Lincoln Hospital, Andre signed twenty consent forms related to his treatment. (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 59-60; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 59-60.) Eight of the consent forms were signed by both Andre and a sign-language interpreter, but twelve were signed by Andre without the additional signature of an interpreter. (Id.) Andre signed ten additional forms at Lincoln relating to his discharge and care plans, none of which included an interpreter's signature. (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 70-79; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 70-79.) At Jacobi Hospital, Andre signed seven consent forms, one that included the signature of an interpreter and six that did not. (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 61-69; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 61-69.)
SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD.
Summary judgment "shall" be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Rule 56(a), Fed. R. Civ. P. A fact is material [*7]  if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law . . . ." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). On a motion for summary judgment, the court must "construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant." Delaney v. Bank of Am. Corp., 766 F.3d 163, 167 (2d Cir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted). It is the initial burden of the movant to come forward with evidence on each material element of his claim or defense, demonstrating entitlement to relief, and the evidence on each material element must be sufficient to entitle the movant to relief in its favor as a matter of law. Vt. Teddy Bear Co. v. 1-800 Beargram Co., 373 F.3d 241, 244 (2d Cir. 2004).
If the moving party meets its burden, "the nonmoving party must come forward with admissible evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact for trial in order to avoid summary judgment." Jaramillo v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 536 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 2008). "A dispute regarding a material fact is genuine 'if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'" Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 41 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248). "A party opposing summary judgment does not show the existence of a genuine issue of fact to be tried merely by making assertions that are conclusory or based on speculation." Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 310 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal citations omitted). An opposing party's [*8]  facts "must be material and of a substantial nature, not fanciful, frivolous, gauzy, spurious, irrelevant, gossamer inferences, conjectural, speculative, nor merely suspicions." Contemporary Mission, Inc. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 648 F.2d 97, 107 n.14 (2d Cir. 1981) (quotation marks omitted).
Local Civil Rule 56.1(a) requires a summary judgment movant to annex a "short and concise statement, in numbered paragraphs, of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried." In support of its motion, the HHC has filed a 583-paragraph Rule 56.1 Statement that is 102 pages in length. (Docket # 38.) It recounts in detail Andre Berry's interactions with hospital staff and the nature of his communications during these interactions. Plaintiff Berry-Mayes disputes many of the facts asserted by the HHC. Certain of her statements in opposition, including those going to the strength of Andre Berry's communications abilities, are specific and point to conflicting evidence in the record, but many others are conclusory, speculative or go to the weight to be afforded certain statements. In granting the HHC's motion, the Court construes the facts in the light most favorable to Berry-Mayes and resolves all ambiguities in her favor. See Delaney, 766 F.3d at 167. However, to the extent that Berry-Mayes has [*9]  made conclusory or speculative statements in opposition, those statements do not raise factual disputes that would permit a reasonable jury to find in her favor. See Major League Baseball Properties, 542 F.3d at 310.
DISCUSSION.
I. Overview of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.
The Rehabilitation Act provides that "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . ." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Justice Department regulations require that recipients of federal funding "shall insure that communications with their . . . beneficiaries are effectively conveyed to those having impaired . . . hearing." 28 C.F.R. § 42.503(e). "A recipient hospital that provides health services or benefits shall establish a procedure for effective communication with persons with impaired hearing for the purpose of providing emergency health care." 45 C.F.R. § 84.52(c). A hospital also "shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids" to persons with impaired sensory or speaking skills, which "may include . . . interpreters, and other aids for persons with [*10]  impaired hearing." 45 C.F.R. § 84.52(d)(1), (3). "Thus the RA does not ensure equal medical treatment, but does require equal access to and equal participation in a patient's own treatment." Loeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 (2d Cir. 2009).
Title II of the ADA states that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. DOJ regulations require that "[a] public entity shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with applicants, participants, members of the public, and companions with disabilities are as effective as communications with others." 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(a)(1). They further state that "[a] public entity shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford individuals with disabilities . . . an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity of a public entity." Id. § 35.160(b)(1). Auxiliary aids are defined to include "[q]ualified interpreters on-site or through video remote interpreting (VRI) services . . . written materials; exchange of written notes; . . . voice, text, and video-based telecommunications [*11]  products and systems, including text telephones (TTYs), videophones, and captioned telephones, or equally effective telecommunications devices; videotext displays; accessible electronic and information technology; or other effective methods of making aurally delivered information available to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing." 28 C.F.R. § 35.104(1).
The ADA regulations further provide that the type of auxiliary aid "will vary" depending upon the circumstances and the request of the individual with a disability:
The type of auxiliary aid or service necessary to ensure effective communication will vary in accordance with the method of communication used by the individual; the nature, length, and complexity of the communication involved; and the context in which the communication is taking place. In determining what types of auxiliary aids and services are necessary, a public entity shall give primary consideration to the requests of individuals with disabilities.
28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2).
The Second Circuit has observed that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act contain near-identical requirements when claims are brought against local governments. See Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003) ("[a]lthough there are subtle differences between these disability acts, [*12]  the standards adopted by Title II of the ADA for State and local government services are generally the same as those required under section 504 of federally assisted programs and activities.") (quotation marks omitted); accord Wright v. New York State Dep't of Corr., 831 F.3d 64, 2016 WL 4056036, at *4 (2d Cir., 2016) (treating ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims "identically" "[b]ecause the standards under both statutes are generally the same and the subtle distinctions between the statutes are not implicated in this case . . . .").
The parties have not pointed to any differences in applying the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to plaintiff's claims. (See, e.g., Pl. Mem. at 4 ("Conveniently, Title II and Section 504 impose essentially the same standards on covered entities . . . .").) The Court therefore considers the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims together.
To make out a prima facie violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must show that he is "(1) a 'handicapped person' as defined in the RA; (2) 'otherwise qualified' to participate in the offered activity or to enjoy its benefits; (3) excluded from such participation or enjoyment solely by reason of his or her handicap; and (4) being denied participation in a program that receives federal financial assistance." Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 275; see also Wright, 831 F.3d at 65, 2016 WL 4056036, at *4 [*13]  (listing same requirements for a prima facie violation of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act). "Once a prima facie violation of section 504 has been established, "the defendant must present evidence to rebut the inference of illegality." Rothschild v. Grottenthaler, 907 F.2d 286, 290 (2d Cir. 1990).
For the purposes of this motion, the HHC does not dispute that, under the federal statutes, Andre was a qualified individual with a disability, or that the HHC is an entity that receives federal funds and is therefore required to comply with the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. (Def. Mem. at 4 n.2.)
An entity covered by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act must provide the assistance necessary to permit a disabled individual to participate in the relevant activities. See, e.g., Rothschild, 907 F.2d at 293 (school district required to provide sign-language interpreter for deaf parents attending parent-teacher conferences). The required assistance varies based on the circumstances. Rothschild concluded that a school district must provide sign-language interpreters to deaf parents only for school-initiated conferences that involved academic or disciplinary issues. Id. The district was not, however, required to provide an interpreter for extra-curricular events or the school graduation ceremony. Id. at 292-93. The Second Circuit described this as "an accommodation which fosters the [parents'] interest in their children's educational development by facilitating their involvement [*14]  in that development, without requiring the School District to subsidize parental involvement in extracurricular activities." Id. at 293.
When providing accommodations under the two statutes, covered entities must "engage in an individualized inquiry" to determine whether an accommodation is reasonable under Title II of the ADA. Wright, 831 F.3d at 68, 2016 WL 4056036, at *8. In Wright, which involved an inmate's request to use a motorized wheelchair in a state correctional facility, the Second Circuit concluded that officials improperly relied on a blanket rule against the use of motorized wheelchairs, and did not evaluate the plaintiff's individual circumstances when denying his request for an accommodation. 831 F.3d 68-69, [WL] at *8-9.
II. No Reasonable Jury Could Conclude that Andre Berry Was Denied the Accommodations Required by the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.
A. Andre's Difficulties in Communicating.
It is undisputed that Andre was deaf. (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 3; Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 3.) He was able to communicate comfortably by using sign language. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 6; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 6.) He understood English, and told hospital staff that his preferred language was English. (See, e.g., Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 4, 88, 90, 124; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 4, 88, 90, 124.) At times he used a hearing aid, the [*15]  use of which was documented by hospital staff. (See, e.g., Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 95, 191, 221, 262; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 95, 191, 221, 262.) Denise testified that Andre had the ability to read lips in certain circumstances, and some nurses and doctors who treated Andre noted that he could read lips. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 3, 77, 249, 409; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 3, 77, 249, 409.)
The parties disagree about the extent to which Andre was able to communicate by using spoken English. According to the HHC, Andre had "verbal speech capabilities," but Denise testified that he had "ineffective speech capabilities" and "wasn't competent with his speech." (Def. 56.1 ¶ 4; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 4.) Denise testified that Andre was "[n]ot completely mute, but couldn't communicate effectively, verbally." (Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 4.) In discussing the HHC's summary judgment motion, the Court views the facts in the light most favorable to Berry-Mayes, and assumes for the purposes of this motion that Andre could not communicate effectively by speaking.
B. Andre's Visits to Lincoln Hospital.
Andre visited Lincoln Hospital several times in 2012 and 2013. The HHC has come forward with unrebutted evidence that it provided him with an interpreter [*16]  during the critical moments of treatment and at nearly all of his visits. The HHC provided an interpreter on his visits to Lincoln Hospital's renal clinic on September 4 and December 18, 2012 (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 72-73, 81-82, Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 72-73, 81-82), a January 10, 2013 visit to its outpatient clinic (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 122-24; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 122-24), a January 16, 2013 visit where he underwent vascular surgery (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 128-136; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 128-36) and during a January 24, 2013 visit to the emergency room and his ensuing stay. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 141, 154, 182, 226, 228; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 141, 154, 182, 226, 228.) In her deposition, Denise testified that when she visited Andre on January 29, 2013, she requested a Deaf Talk machine for Andre, which the staff provided but then appeared unable to operate. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 207-13.) Staff notations made later that morning state that staff was communicating with Andre via a Deaf Talk machine and interpreter. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 214, 216; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 214, 216.)
The Court need not recount all of those visits in detail, but in light of the plaintiff's contention that the hospitals failed to assess Andre's needs and provide necessary accommodations, [*17]  it is worthwhile to review an illustrative example of his treatment at Lincoln, and plaintiff's evidence in opposition. During a January 25, 2013 visit to Lincoln Hospital, a social worker observed that Andre had a communication impediment because he was deaf, noted that his preferred language was English and noted that an interpreter was "required." (Pl. 56.1 ¶ 16; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 16; Def. 56.1 ¶ 179; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 179.) The hospital provided a sign-language interpreter and the social worker conducted a "comprehensive assessment" of Andre. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 180; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 180.) The social worker noted that Andre "appears to have insight" about his illness and "appears able to verbalize questions and concerns." (Def. 56.1 ¶ 180; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 180.) Through the interpreter, the social worker discussed discharge plans with Andre. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 181; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 181.)
In opposition, plaintiff contends only that the record identifies an interpreter as "Jackie number 9132" who used a Deaf Talk machine, but that the records do not indicate the length of time that the interpreter was used, and that Deaf Talk invoices do not have an entry for an interpreter used on this date. (Pl. [*18]  56.1 Resp. ¶ 180.) This is not evidence that an interpreter was not used on that date, however, and is not evidence that the HHC failed to provide Andre with a reasonable accommodation.
At times, notations made by staff at Lincoln Hospital indicate communications that did not involve an interpreter, including observations that Andre was "able to read lips" and use the "deaf computer," "communicates clearly with [his] hearing aid," "obeys verbal commands" and is "easily upset when being talked to"; hospital records indicate that in the hours after the latter notation was made, Andre communicated with staff through an interpreter. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 249, 262, 167, 170, 180, 184; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 249, 262, 167, 170, 180, 184.) As discussed, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and their implementing regulations do not require that a sign-language interpreter be provided for every interaction with a hearing-impaired patient. In opposition, Berry-Mayes has not explained how these interactions with staff violated Andre's right to equal access to the HHC's services or otherwise short of the accommodations required by federal law or.
Andre made additional visits to Lincoln where there is no documentation [*19]  concerning the use of an interpreter. On April 10, 2013, he received a pre-scheduled "revision to the left AV fistula" that had been the subject of his January 2013 procedure, and attended a follow-up appointment on April 26. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 261-72; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 261-72.) There is no indication that an interpreter was provided, but notes stated that Andre "communicates clearly with [his] hearing aid" and "verbalized adequate understanding regarding pain management." (Id.) In a visit to the emergency department on September 19, 2013, there is no notation indicating that he was provided with a translator, but staff noted that Andre was deaf and used hearing aids; he received emergency dialysis treatment and signed a form titled "Departure Against Medical Advice." (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 284-99; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 284-99.) Andre arrived to the emergency department on three other dates seeking dialysis treatment, during which staff recorded difficulties in communicating with him, and there is no indication that a translator was provided during these visits. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 273-83, 300-18.) However, as noted in the appendix to the ADA regulations:
[T]he type of auxiliary aid or service necessary to [*20]  ensure effective communication will vary with the situation . . . . Sign language or oral interpreters, for example, may be required when the information being communicated in a transaction with a deaf individual is complex, or is exchanged for a lengthy period of time. . . . [A]n individual who is deaf or hard of hearing may need a qualified interpreter to communicate with municipal hospital personnel about diagnoses, procedures, tests, treatment options, surgery, or prescribed medication (e.g., dosage, side effects, drug interactions, etc.), or to explain follow-up treatments, therapies, test results, or recovery. In comparison, in a simpler, shorter interaction, the method to achieve effective communication can be more basic.
28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. A, Subpart E — Communications. The appendix commentary makes plain that the nature and circumstances of the hospital visit are relevant to determining whether a sign language interpreter is required.
An individual with a chronic renal disease who routinely received dialysis treatment and sought treatment on a walk-in basis may not need a sign-language interpreter, particularly for an individual who can read the written word and has some ability to read lips. Situations that [*21]  involve surgery, diagnosis or more complex treatment may require an interpreter. Berry-Mayes has cited no evidence that Andre requested an interpreter during these visits or that any such request was denied. She also has cited no evidence that the absence of an interpreter during these visits affected Andre's right to equal access to the HHC or affected his care or treatment options.
C. Andre's Stay at Jacobi Hospital.
Andre's spent eight days at Jacobi Hospital in late October 2013. On October 21, 2013, Andre arrived at the hospital's emergency room and remained at the facility until October 29, when he voluntarily discharged himself against the advice of doctors. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 381; Pl. ¶ 381.) A sign-language interpreter was present at Jacobi when he arrived at the hospital on October 21, but it is unclear whether Andre used an interpreter. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 382; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 382.) On the following day, an interpreter was sent to communicate with Andre but was unable to wake him. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 385; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 385.)
When Denise visited Andre at Jacobi on or about October 23, 2013, she asked a nurse why her brother did not have a Deaf Talk machine by his bed or a sign-language interpreter, [*22]  and explained that her brother was deaf. (Pl. 56.1 ¶ 34.) In her deposition, Denise testified that a doctor had been unable to explain a surgical procedure to Andre because Andre was deaf, and that the doctor did not know how to use the Deaf Talk machine in Andre's room. (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 39-40; Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 39-40.) Hospital records for that date state: "The sister Denise Berry of [unit] 4B patient Andre Berry states that her brother needs a sign language interpreter to communicate with staff on 4B because the sister states that his hearing aid battery is getting low." (Def. 56.1 ¶ 388; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 388.) The records state: "Sign language interpreter Larry visited the patient on 10/23/13 in the morning to interpret for the nurses. Larry states that the patient told him he is refusing the sign language interpreting services because he is able to communicate with the nurses without the assistance of a sign language interpreter." (Def. 56.1 ¶ 389; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 389.) The records state that Richard Hill, a patient representative at Jacobi, then contacted a sign language interpreter and arranged for her to interpret for Andre that evening. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 392; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 392.) The [*23]  interpreter worked with Andre for approximately three hours, beginning at 5:30 p.m. and continuing through his transfer to a different hospital room. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 392; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 392.)
Hospital records indicate that the following evening, the same interpreter worked with Andre for slightly less than one hour "in preparation for" his upcoming vascular surgery. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 395-96; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 395-96.) He communicated through a different interpreter earlier that day. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 393; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 393.) Andre had vascular surgery on October 25, 2013. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 397; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 397.) Interpreter invoices reflect that an interpreter provided services for Andre on October 26, 27 and 28. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 399-400, 402.) The plaintiff cites to written assessments from hospital staff for that same period, which noted difficulties in communicating with Andre and his use of a malfunctioning hearing aid. (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 23-26; Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 23-26.)
On October 29, 2013, doctors observed that Andre had ongoing vascular problems due to clotting. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 503-04; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 503-04.) One doctor noted that Andre was "frustrated" and "asking to leave today" because he "has [*24]  bills that he has to pay." (Def. 56.1 ¶ 505; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 505.) The doctor explained the risks of leaving against medical advice and that an additional procedure was planned for the following day. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 505; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 505.) About a half-hour later, Andre spoke to a social worker who offered to get him an interpreter, but Andre declined and stated that he would read her lips. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 506; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 506.) Andre stated that he needed to leave the hospital to pay his bills and retrieve hearing-aid batteries, but that doctors told him he could not leave or go alone. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 506; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 506.) The social worker returned with a sign language interpreter and explained that Andre could sign himself out, but would have to wait for doctors to remove his tubes, and that he must return to Jacobi or visit another hospital. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 507; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 507.) A doctor's notation recounted a conversation with Andre that occurred through an interpreter and in the presence of a social worker in which the doctor strongly urged him against leaving the hospital and explained that a procedure was scheduled for the next day. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 511; Pl. 56.1 ¶ 511.) [*25]  Andre was discharged at approximately 3:30 p.m. on October 29. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 510; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 510.)
The HHC has come forward with evidence that throughout Andre's stay at Jacobi, he was provided with the reasonable accommodations required by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. An interpreter was provided for Andre during all major discussions of his condition, including those related to his surgery and his discharge. HHC staff provided a translator when Andre did not specifically request one, and, prior to his discharge, after Andre expressly declined translator services. Hospital staff thoroughly documented Andre's communication needs, including the functioning of his hearing aid and his ability to read lips. In opposition, Berry-Mayes frequently objects to the materiality or relevance of the HHC's evidence, but has failed to identify any instance where Jacobi staff failed to provide an accommodation to Andre.
D. Andre's Post-Discharge Visit to Lincoln and Subsequent Death.
Following his discharge from Jacobi, Andre arrived at Denise's home, and she advised him to return to the hospital. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 512-13; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 512-13.) Denise then called 911, and an ambulance was dispatched [*26]  to transport Andre to Lincoln. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 515-17; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 515-17.) EMS noted that Andre's chief complaint involved pain in the region of his dialysis shunt and that he was transported to Lincoln without incident. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 520-22; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 520-22.)
At Lincoln, a nurse observed that Andre was "hearing impaired" and "speech impaired" and recorded pain and swelling in the region around his dialysis shunt. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 523; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 523.) Andre signed a "General Consent to Treatment," and the form was not signed by a sign-language interpreter. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 524; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 524.) A nurse and a doctor examined Andre and assessed his history, changed the dressing on his wound site and deemed him stable for discharge. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 525-34; Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 525-35.) He was provided with a "Follow-Up" form instructing him to visit his primary care provider in one week. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 535; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 535.) Andre was discharged from Lincoln at 12:43 a.m. on October 30. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 540; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 540.)
In declarations, the nurse and doctor state that Andre did not request a sign-language interpreter, and that if he had requested one, an interpreter would have been [*27]  provided; in opposition, Berry-Mayes contends that their statements are "irrelevant" and "immaterial." (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 541-42; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 541-42.) The nurse and doctor also state that if they believed Andre had not understood them, they would have taken additional steps to accommodate him; Berry-Mayes opposes these statements as "speculative" and containing "improper pronouns." (Def. 56.1 ¶ 544; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 544.)
After being discharged from Lincoln, Andre did not return to Denise's home, Jacobi or his primary-care physician. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 558-59; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 558-59.) A doctor at Jacobi called Denise the following day to seek out information about Andre's status and whereabouts. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 561; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 561.) They discussed the difficulty of reaching Andre at his home, and Denise testified in her deposition that she "probably" tried to contact Andre thereafter. (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 561-62; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 561-62.) Andre was found dead in his apartment on November 5. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 563; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 563.)
Andre was not provided an interpreter at this final visit to Lincoln, but the nurse and doctor who treated him state that he did not request one and that they believed [*28]  they were able to communicate with him effectively. Their treatment consisted of dressing Andre's wound site, which "appeared clean," and the nurse's notes state that Andre denied having serious symptoms such as fever, chills, chest pain or shortness of breath. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 529; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 529.) When asked, Andre denied that he was experiencing any pain. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 532; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 532.) Their interaction with Andre was of a relatively limited nature and did not involve the more complicated interaction that could require the use of an interpreter. Berry-Mayes has not explained why an interpreter should have been made available during this visit, and has not come forward with evidence in opposition that supports a violation of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.
E. In Opposition, Berry-Mayes Has Not Come Forward with Evidence that Would Permit a Reasonable Jury to Find in Her Favor.
Berry-Mayes often asserts that the hospital's records about the use of an interpreter are insufficient to "establish" that an interpreter was actually used, but she does not explain why. (See, e.g., Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 399, 401.) In one instance, she asserts that the interpreter's signature "looks [*29]  nothing like her signature on any of the Time Sheet records." (Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 396.) Elsewhere, she disputes the HHC's statements concerning the use of an interpreter because the doctor's notation does not identify the interpreter by name or explain the interpreter's qualifications. (Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 106.) Berry-Mayes's statements in opposition "are conclusory or based on speculation," and do not defeat the HHC's motion for summary judgment. Major League Baseball, 542 F.3d at 310.
Berry-Mayes has not identified a single instance where the HHC failed to offer or provide a reasonable accommodation to Andre. In support of her own motion, she relies primarily on the fact that some consent forms include the signature of both Andre and an interpreter, whereas other consent forms contain only Andre's signature. (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 47-79.) This is not evidence that the HHC failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. Berry-Mayes does not contend that Andre was impaired in his ability to understand written English or that an interpreter was required in order for him to understand the forms. The absence of an interpreter's signature on the forms also does not support the inference that the HHC did not supply an interpreter to explain [*30]  or discuss the underlying procedures. For example, the HHC has submitted documentation reflecting that it repeatedly provided interpreter services to Andre in the days before and after his surgery of October 25, 2013. (See Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 395-402.) Plaintiff notes that six consent forms from Jacobi Hospital for this same period do not include an interpreter's signature. (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 61-67; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 61-67.) Given that the hospital staff had documented Andre's communications difficulties (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 23-27; Def. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 23-27), provided him an interpreter for portions of each day preceding and following the surgery (Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 395-402; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 395-402), and that there is no contention that Andre was unable to read English, the absence of an interpreter's signature on the consent forms does not support the conclusion that he was denied the accommodations necessary to understand and communicate about his care and treatment decisions. Again, reasonable accommodations must be tailored to each individual's needs and circumstances. See, e.g., Wright, 831 F.3d at 68-69, 2016 WL 4056036, at *8-9; Rothschild, 907 F.2d at 293.
It is consistent with the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act for a hospital to provide an interpreter only in particular situations [*31]  during a patient's hospitalization. Martin v. Halifax Health Care Systems, Inc., 621 Fed. Appx. 594 (11th Cir. 2015) (summary order), affirmed a district court decision granting summary judgment to the defendant hospital in a case brought under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act by three plaintiffs. One of the plaintiffs requested an interpreter immediately upon arrival to the hospital, but staff cancelled the request when it was determined that he required emergency cardiac catheterization. Id. at 596. During the procedure, he communicated with doctors and staff using written notes, gestures and lip-reading. Id. at 596-97. In his deposition, the plaintiff testified that throughout his five-day hospitalization, he requested a live sign-language interpreter and that for the majority of the time, no such interpreter was available. Id. at 597. Staff mainly communicated with him through friends and family, written notes and gestures. Id. at 597-98. In affirming the grant of summary judgment, Eleventh Circuit concluded that the hospital used "appropriate auxiliary aids" to communicate with the patient, including written notes, and that he was also provided with eight hours of live sign-language interpreting services. Id. at 602. It noted that the record did not show a failure on the part of the hospital to ensure effective [*32]  communications and concluded that no reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff. Id. at 603.
A second plaintiff was the deaf mother of a patient at the same hospital, who requested a live interpreter while her seventeen-year-old daughter went into labor. Id. at 598. The plaintiff was provided with an interpreter for about five hours total during the patient's four-day stay. Id. at 598. For the remainder of the time, staff communicated through the plaintiff through her daughter and via written notes. Id. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the plaintiff was provided and offered appropriate auxiliary aids, and that she was able to communicate with staff to an extent that no reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff. Id. at 603.
A third patient was not provided with a live interpreter during a two-hour emergency room visit, and communicated with hospital staff through written notes. Id. at 598-99. There was no evidence in the record that the patient requested a live interpreter or that there were communications difficulties between the patient and staff. Id. at 603. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that no reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff. Id.
As was the case with the hospital in Martin, Lincoln Hospital and Jacobi Hospital sometimes [*33]  provided Andre with an interpreter but also communicated with him using other means. However, in this case, unlike Martin, there is no evidence that the hospital ever denied Andre, or anyone acting upon his behalf, an interpreter when one was requested. Because Berry-Mayes has not come forward with evidence that the HHC denied Andre a reasonable accommodation, the HHC's summary judgment motion is granted.
III. The Record Does Not Support a Declaratory Judgment or Compensatory Damages.
A. Plaintiff Has Not Identified Any "Useful Purpose" to Issuing a Declaratory Judgment.
Berry-Mayes seeks, pursuant to Rule 57, Fed. R. Civ. P., and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, a declaratory judgment stating that the HHC subjected Andre to unlawful discrimination. (Pl. Mem. 27-28; Compl't ¶ 75 (seeking declaratory judgment that the HHC's "practices, policies and procedures subjected Andre Berry to discrimination . . . .").) The Declaratory Judgment Act states:
In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction . . . any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought. Any such [*34]  declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.
28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). "The Act does not require the courts to issue a declaratory judgment. Rather, it 'confers a discretion on the courts rather than an absolute right upon the litigant.'" The New York Times Co. v. Gonzales, 459 F.3d 160, 165 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 287, 115 S. Ct. 2137, 132 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1995)). "[T]he fundamental purpose of the DJA is to 'avoid accrual of avoidable damages to one not certain of his rights and to afford him an early adjudication without waiting until his adversary should see fit to begin suit, after damage has accrued' . . . ." United States v. Doherty, 786 F.2d 491, 498 (2d Cir. 1986) (quoting Luckenbach Steamship Co. v. United States, 312 F.2d 545, 548 (2d Cir. 1963)).
A court should weigh five factors in determining whether declaratory judgment is appropriate:
(i) whether the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying or settling the legal issues involved; (ii) whether a judgment would finalize the controversy and offer relief from uncertainty; (iii) whether the proposed remedy is being used merely for 'procedural fencing' or a 'race to res judicata'; (iv) whether the use of a declaratory judgment would increase friction between sovereign legal systems or improperly encroach on the domain of a state or foreign court; and (v) whether there is a better or more effective remedy.
New York Times, 459 F.3d at 167 (quotation marks omitted). [*35] 
Berry-Mayes has not identified a "useful purpose" for issuing a declaratory judgment or explained how it would finalize the controversy or offer relief from uncertainty. She argues only that if she prevails at trial, "declaratory relief would be appropriate to clarify the legal issues involved and to finalize the controversy." (Pl. Mem. at 28.) However, she offers no explanation as to why this would be the case. Her claims are directed to events that occurred more than a year prior to the commencement of this action during the lifetime of the now-deceased Andre, and do not implicate the "accrual of avoidable damages" or a need for "early adjudication." Doherty, 786 F.2d at 498.
Because Berry-Mayes has not raised any argument or identified any facts as to why declaratory judgment is appropriate, the HHC's summary judgment motion is granted as to declaratory relief.
B. There Is No Evidence of Deliberate Indifference Entitling Plaintiff to Compensatory Damages under the Rehabilitation Act.
In order for a plaintiff to receive compensatory damages under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant showed "deliberate indifference" to the "strong likelihood" that its actions were unlawful [*36]  under the federal statutes. Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 275. A claim for money damages may "survive a plaintiff's death." Gershanow v. Cnty. of Rockland, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37004, 2014 WL 1099821, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2014).
"Deliberate indifference" does not require evidence of "personal animosity or ill will." Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 275. A plaintiff must show that a person in a position of responsibility could have instituted corrective measures on behalf of the person discriminated against but failed to do so. Id. at 276. In Loeffler, the Second Circuit concluded that a plaintiff offered evidence of deliberate indifference based on official decisions not to pursue multiple, ongoing requests for a sign-language interpreter or other auxiliary aids to a deaf patient who was undergoing surgery. Id. Loeffler suggested, but did not explicitly hold, that deliberate indifference "must be a 'deliberate choice, rather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction.'" Id. (quoting Reynolds v. Giuliani, 506 F.3d 183, 193 (2d Cir. 2007)).
Assuming that there was some evidence that the HHC had denied a reasonable accommodation to Andre, Berry-Mayes has not come forward with evidence that the HHC was deliberately indifferent to its obligations under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. As discussed, the HHC had sign language interpreters assigned to both Lincoln and Jacobi, and when interpreters were not already present [*37]  for the hospital, they were brought in as needed. As also has been discussed, hospital staff thoroughly recorded Andre's communications abilities. When Denise requested an interpreter, one was provided about 90 minutes later. There is no evidence that Andre ever requested an interpreter, and on at least one occasion, the staff utilized a translator even though Andre indicated that he preferred to proceed without one.
Further, a written notice titled "We Provide Free Interpretation Services" was posted in Lincoln's common areas, informing patients that free sign-language interpretation was available. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 42; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 42.) Jacobi mounted similar posters in its elevator banks, waiting rooms and patient units. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 348; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 348.) The HHC provided patients with a Patient Handbook that explained that facilities employed patient representatives that could help arrange for interpretation services. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 346; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 346.)
The HHC has come forward with evidence that it had policies to ensure that hearing-impaired patients had access to an interpreter, and that patients were aware of their right to an interpreter. Berry-Mayes has not directed [*38]  the Court to evidence that any individual with knowledge of Andre's disabilities failed to act on his behalf, and thus no reasonable jury could conclude that the HHC was deliberately indifferent to its obligations under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. The HHC's motion for summary judgment is therefore granted as to plaintiff's claim for compensatory damages.
IV. The Court Declines to Exercise Supplemental Jurisdiction over Plaintiff's Claims under the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL.
A district court "may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over" a state-law claim if, as here, "the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction." 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3). Its discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in such a situation, however, "is not boundless." Valencia ex rel. Franco v. Lee, 316 F.3d 299, 305 (2d Cir. 2003). "In deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction over supplemental state-law claims, district courts should balance the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity — the 'Cohill factors.'" Klein & Co. Futures, Inc. v. Bd. of Trade, 464 F.3d 255, 262 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350, 108 S. Ct. 614, 98 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1988)). "[I]n the usual case in which all federal-law claims are eliminated before trial, the balance of factors will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims." Kolari v. New York-Presbyterian Hosp., 455 F.3d 118, 122 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350 n. 7 (ellipsis [*39]  omitted)).
This is such a case. Moreover, this case does not implicate preemption issues and is not ready for trial, unlike actions in which the Second Circuit deemed it proper for the district court to retain supplemental jurisdiction after federal claims were dismissed. See Valencia, 316 F.3d at 306 (collecting cases). Accordingly, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims under the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL.
CONCLUSION.
The plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment is DENIED and the defendant's summary judgment motion is GRANTED. The Clerk is directed to terminate the motions. (Docket # 31, 43.) The Clerk is directed to close the case and to enter judgment in favor of the defendant as to Count One and Count Two and to dismiss Counts Three and Four without prejudice.
SO ORDERED.
