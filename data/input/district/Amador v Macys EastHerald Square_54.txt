MEMORANDUM & ORDER
MICHAEL H. DOLINGER
UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE:
Pro se plaintiff Melinda Amador commenced this case, asserting that her former employer, Macy's Retail Holdings, Inc. (sued as Macy's East-Herald Square) ("Macy's"), violated her rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112 et seq. She premises her claim primarily on defendant's termination of her employment as of June 14, 2007.
Defendant has moved for summary-judgment. For the reasons that follow, we grant the motion.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff is a former employee of Macy's, in its Herald Square store in New York City. (Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 14). She began working for Macy's in 1996. (Answer ¶ 9). In 1997, plaintiff earned an Associate's Degree in fashion merchandising from Kingsborough Community College and continued thereafter working for defendant. (Amador Dep. 186-87). In August 2006, plaintiff was working as a fashion consultant in the Macy's by Appointment [*2]  department. (Answer ¶ 9; Amador Dep. 43-44).
Plaintiff described the position as "a complimentary shopping department where you would come in and you could have like a wardrobe fashion consultant." (Amador Dep. 44). She explained that her job entailed assisting wardrobe shoppers either over-the-phone or in person, using "her expertise as far as fashion" to help them find "what would look right." (Id.) She also asserted that the job required, among other tasks, walking about the store, carrying items, and standing for long periods. (Id. at 144, 186).
On Saturday, August 12, 2006, plaintiff suffered an injury while working at Macy's. (See Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 15).1 On her way to leave for the evening, she failed to notice food on the floor. (Amador Dep. 41). She then stumbled, contorted, and broke her fall in a way that resulted in a contusion on her left thigh. (Id. at 41-42).2
The following week, plaintiff phoned Maria Acosta, plaintiff's managing supervisor. (Id. at 45-46, 49; Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 17). Plaintiff informed Ms. Acosta of the incident that had occurred over the weekend and explained that, due to the injury and the resulting pain, she would be unable to report to work. (Amador Dep. 45, 49, 52; Ex. B to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.).
Plaintiff did not return to work through the end of 2006. (Amador Dep. 53; Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 18). She was also unable to return to work in the beginning of 2007. (Amador Dep. 55; Def.'s 56.1 [*4]  Statement ¶ 19).
In a letter dated February 8, 2007, defendant communicated with plaintiff regarding her leave of absence. (Ex. B to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.). The letter delineated defendant's leave policy: an allowance of a maximum of twenty-six weeks of leave in any rolling twelve-month period, barring the application of the ADA or some other applicable law. (Id.). The letter further explained that plaintiff's allotted twenty-six weeks of allowed leave -- along with her employment -- were to end on February 11, 2007. (Id.). Plaintiff was instructed, however, that she could contact defendant's Central Disability office ("Central Disability") by February 22, 2007 to request an extension of her leave due to an ADA-related disability. (Id.).
Plaintiff received this letter at her home address and understood its contents. (Amador Dep. 57-59). Pursuant to the letter's instructions, she called Central Disability to request an extension of her leave. (Id. at 61; Ex. C to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.).
In response to that request, Central Disability sent another letter to plaintiff, dated February 20, 2007. (Ex. C to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. [*5]  J.). This second letter explained that, in order to evaluate plaintiff's request for leave under the ADA, she was required to have her doctor answer the questions contained in an enclosed Physician's Statement/Certification Form ("Physician's Questionnaire"). (Id.).
The letter stated as follows:
Where an accommodation is requested your doctor must be specific when indicating restrictions. e.g. how much time can you stand or sit and how much time must you rest in between, how much weight can you lift, how many hours in the day can you work, and for what period of time the restrictions are to remain in place. If the restrictions are permanent, please so state. If not, a projected end date for your requested accommodation must be included, along with a date of your return to work, if applicable.
(Id.) (emphasis in original). Finally, the letter instructed that the Physician's Questionnaire was to be returned on or before March 6, 2007, and it provided three telephone numbers that plaintiff could call, Monday through Friday, if she had any questions or required additional information. (Id.).
Plaintiff received and understood this letter, including the requirement that her physician be specific [*6]  when indicating restrictions on the Physician's Questionnaire. (Amador Dep. 68-69). She also understood that if those restrictions were permanent, the returned form must so indicate and, if not, that the form must include a projected end date. (Id.).
Due to an illness, plaintiff did not return the Physician's Questionnaire by March 6, 2007. (Id. at 69-70; Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 25). Defendant, however, permitted plaintiff to submit this form late. (Id.).
On March, 15, 2007, plaintiff faxed a copy of the filled-out Physician's Questionnaire to Central Disability. (Ex. D to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.). On the line that asked "employee can stand for how long?" plaintiff's doctor wrote "N/A." (Id.). On the lines that asked for how long plaintiff could sit and how many pounds plaintiff could lift, the doctor wrote nothing. (Id.). Similarly, the doctor wrote nothing on the lines that asked how many days plaintiff could work weekly and how many hours plaintiff could work daily. (Id.). Under "other restriction(s)" the doctor wrote, "patient totally disabled from all employment until further notice." (Id.).
In response to the question, "Are listed restrictions permanent?" the doctor [*7]  checked neither the "yes" nor the "no" boxes, instead writing in, "unknown." (Id.). The doctor wrote "N/A" on the line that asked, "If not permanent, give date restrictions are projected to end," which is immediately adjacent to the warning, "(Date Must Be Entered to have Request Considered)." (Id.) (emphasis in original). And next to the line, "Date employee can return to work," which also includes a reiteration of the above warning, the doctor wrote "undetermined." (Id.).
This was all despite a separate, three-line set of instructions at the top of the page that included the following: "Avoid use of terms such as unknown or undetermined." (Id.).
On March 16, 2007, defendant sent another letter to plaintiff's home address with a copy of the Physician's Questionnaire enclosed. (Ex. E to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.). This letter reiterated the requirement that any restrictions be specifically indicated. (Id.). It also repeated that "A projected end date for your requested accommodation must be included, along with a date of your return to work, if applicable." (Id.) (emphasis in original). Finally, it provided phone numbers that plaintiff could use to reach out if [*8]  she had any questions and set March 23, 2007 as the date by which plaintiff had to return this form. (Id.).
Plaintiff faxed this second Physician's Questionnaire back to Central Disability on March 26, 2007. (Ex. F. to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.; Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 31).3 As it happened, the copy of the form sent by plaintiff on March 26 was unreadable; and one of defendant's Central Disability administrators called plaintiff to ask her to resend it. (Amador Dep. 79; Ex. F. to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.; Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 32). Plaintiff then re-faxed the form to Central Disability on March 27, 2007. (Ex. G. to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.).
This filled-out Physician's Questionnaire -- dated March 23, 2007 by, plaintiff's doctor -- was different in many respects from the first submitted form. (Id.). It specified that she could both stand and sit for one hour. (Id.). It also stated that she could lift ten pounds. (Id.). Further, next to both [*9]  the "can work how many days weekly?" and "how many hours daily?" questions, plaintiff's physician wrote in this symbol: "ø" (Id.). Whatever its meaning -- not explored in the record -- the doctor elucidated on all of the above next, to the line marked "other restriction(s)." (Id.). There, the doctor wrote, "At this time patient remains, totally disabled from her employment." (Id.).
The doctor was similarly clear about the remaining information he provided on this form. (See id.). The next question on the form was, "Are listed restrictions permanent?" (Id.). The doctor responded here by checking off the boxed marked, "no." (Id.). "For the prompt, "If not permanent, give date restrictions are projected to end," the doctor wrote in "April 30, 2007." (Id.). Similarly, the "[d]ate employee can return to work" was written in as "4/30/07." (Id.).
In a letter dated April 11, 2007, defendant informed plaintiff that her leave of absence had again been extended. (Ex. H to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.) . This letter -- sent by Ms. Christine LaSpina, the Manager, of Central Disability -- explained that plaintiff's leave would expire on April 29, 2007 and she would be "expected to return [*10]  on your first scheduled workday following this date." (Id.). The April 11 letter, like those before it, supplied phone numbers to the plaintiff and informed her that she could call "with any questions or if you are unable to return to work as this letter indicates." (Id.).
On April 30, 2007, plaintiff returned to work and met with Ms. Francesca Aiello, who performed certain human resources functions in defendant's Herald Square store. (Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 39). As noted, defendant's policy was to hold open positions for employees on leave of twenty-six weeks or less. (See, e.g., Aiello Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J. ¶ 4). Therefore, because plaintiff's exact original position had been filled, she met with Ms. Aiello to discuss alternative positions comparable to her job in Macy's by Appointment. (Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 40-41; Amador Dep. 100-03).4
During that discussion, in plaintiff's words, "that's when I thought that, "okay, she doesn't know that I have restrictions." (Amador Dep. 102-03). Plaintiff [*11]  then handed Ms. Aiello a note from her doctor,5 (Amador Dep. 104; Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 40). Contrary to what had been written in the March 23 Physician's Questionnaire, this note reflected current limitations on plaintiff's ability to work. (Ex. I to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.).
Dated April 27, 2007, this note -- not another filled-in Physician's Questionnaire -- stated that plaintiff could only return to work with the following limitations: "Light duty. The patient should not stand for prolonged periods of time, walk up several flights of stairs, or walk for prolonged periods of time due to an acl tear." (Id.).
In receipt of this note, Ms. Aiello called Central Disability and was told that plaintiff had been expected to return to work without restrictions. (Aiello Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J. ¶ 6-7; Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 42; Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J. 9). In light [*12]  of the new note -- which Central Disability perceived to be in conflict with the last Physician's Questionnaire they had on file -- plaintiff did not go back to work on April 30, 2007. (Id.). Instead, Ms. Aiello informed plaintiff that Central Disability would be sending her yet another Physician's Questionnaire to complete, after which another request for accommodations could be processed. (Aiello Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J. ¶ 7; Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 42).
According to defendant, Central Disability sent a letter, dated May 1, 2007, to plaintiff's home address. (LaSpina Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J. ¶¶ 12-13).6 This letter, signed by Ms. LaSpina, asked for the same information as the previous two such letters, enclosed another Physician's Questionnaire, provided a phone number at which plaintiff could reach Ms. LaSpina for questions, and gave plaintiff through May 20, 2007 to return the completed form. (Ex. F to LaSpina Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J. 12).
Plaintiff provides no evidence to dispute that defendant sent this letter, although she claims not to have received it. (Amador Dep. 113-14).
For the period subsequent to April 30 and prior to June 14, 2007, plaintiff provides conflicting testimony about whatever conversations may have taken place between her and defendant. At one point in her deposition, plaintiff stated that she had spoken with Central Disability "several times" between April 30 and June 14 of 2007. (Id. at 40). There, she states that each conversation was with Ms. LaSpina. (Id.). Elsewhere in her deposition, she states [*14]  that she spoke with Central Disability and Ms. LaSpina only once during this period. (Id. at 119-21). There, she also admits that -- aside from this one conversation with Ms. LaSpina -- she placed no other phone calls to Central Disability between April 30 and her termination on June 14. (Id. at 124). After speaking with Ms. LaSpina once, plaintiff called neither her nor any of the other numbers or individuals with whom she had previously had contact about the matter. (Id. at 123-24).
Both of these versions conflict with the allegations in the statement accompanying plaintiff's complaint, in which she states that "I was trying to inform Ms. LaSpina for several weeks that I had to wait for availability to get an appt to see my Dr. Ms. LaSpina never returned my call's!" (Compl. 10).
What is clear, however, is that -- though asserting non-receipt of the May 1 letter -- plaintiff understood that she was being asked to supply additional information from her doctor.7 (Id.; Amador Dep. 121) . She provided nothing further to defendants, who then sent a letter dated June 14, 2007 terminating plaintiff's employment. (Ex. G to Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J.; see also Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J. 9).

PROCEDURAL [*17]  HISTORY
On or about April 4, 2008, plaintiff filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") regarding defendant's alleged discriminatory conduct. (See Compl. 3). On March 21, 2012, unable to make any determinations based on the information provided to it, the EEOC mailed a Notice of Right to Sue letter to plaintiff. (See Compl. 5).
Plaintiff filed suit in this court on June 19, 2012. (Compl. 1). She named as defendants Macy's East-Herald Square,8 Christine LaSpina, Maria Claudia Acosta, and Felix Ocasio. (Id. at 2). On December 11, 2012, plaintiff's claims against defendant LaSpina was dismissed for failure to prosecute and her claims against defendants Acosta and Ocasio were dismissed voluntarily. (Order dated Dec. 11, 2012 [docket no. 25]). The complaint asserts claims under the ADA for discrimination based on plaintiff's alleged disability and for a failure to accommodate. (Compl. 2). Plaintiff alleges that defendant discriminatorily terminated her employment due to and failed to accommodate her disability. (Id.). She attaches to the complaint a typed, unnumbered statement elucidating her claims. (Id. at 9-10).
Macy's now moves for summary-judgment on all of plaintiff's claims.

I. Defendant's Motion
Defendant argues that plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA. (Def.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Summ. J. 5). Defendant asserts that plaintiff cannot show that she was disabled within the meaning of the ADA or regarded as disabled by her employer, as required for such a claim. (Id. at 6-21, 23-24). Defendant further argues that, even were plaintiff to have satisfied the disability prong of her prima facie case, she has presented no facts to show that defendant's reason for terminating her was pretextual. (Id. at 21).

II. Plaintiff's Opposition
Plaintiff, a pro se applicant to this court, provides her opposition to us in the form of an affirmation in opposition to defendant's motion. The structure and substance of this submission are to a degree unclear. (See Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp. to Summ. J.). Functionally, plaintiff appears to frame her opposition around defendant's 56.1 Statement and several of the certifications [*19]  attached to defendant's motion. (Id.)
In plaintiff's opposition, she makes no effort to respond to defendant's assertions about her alleged disability, thereby ignoring the bulk of defendant's motion. Instead, we interpret the crux of her argument to be that discriminatory intent can be proved because she was terminated by an employer who knew she was disabled. (See, e.g., Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp. to Summ. J. 9). Specifically, plaintiff repeatedly asserts that the doctor's note that she brought with her on April 30, 2007 presented no new information. (Id.). In other words, plaintiff believes that the March 23 Physician's Questionnaire that she supplied to Central Disability should have made defendant aware that when she returned to work on April 30, she would be doing so with restrictions. (Id.) ("The letter stated I was being terminated, on the bases of 'since there was no information from you requesting an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). How can that be. You approved my accommodation. To state you didn't receive any info concerning an accommodation is False!"). Plaintiff also asserts that she never received the May 1, 2007 letter asking for the submission [*20]  of another such form. (Id.).

ANALYSIS

I. Summary Judgment Criteria
The court may enter summary judgment only if it concludes that there is no genuine dispute as to the material facts and that, based on the undisputed facts, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see, e.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Holland v. Goord, 758 F.3d 215, 220 (2d Cir. 2014); Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 148 (2d Cir. 2004). "An issue of fact is 'material' for these purposes if it 'might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law [while] [a]n issue of fact is 'genuine' if 'the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'" Shade ex rel. Velez-Shade v. Hous. Auth., 251 F.3d 307, 314 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)) see also Dalberth v. Xerox Corp., 766 F.3d 172, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 17357, 2014 WL 4390695. It is axiomatic that the responsibility of the court in deciding a summary-judgment motion "is not to resolve disputed issues of fact but to assess whether there are any factual issues to be tried, while resolving ambiguities and drawing reasonable inferences against the moving party." Knight v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., 804 F.2d 9, 11 (2d Cir. 1986); see, e.g., Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255; Vivenzio v. City of Syracuse, 611 F.3d 98, 106 (2d Cir. 2010); Howley v. Town of Stratford, 217 F.3d 141, 150-51 (2d Cir. 2000). "[I]n ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a judge must ask himself not whether he thinks the evidence unmistakably favors one side or the other but whether a fair-minded just could return a verdict for the [non-movant] on the evidence presented." McNamara v. Associated Press, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 40 F. Supp. 3d 345, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116771, 2014 WL 4105961, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2014) (quoting Cine SK8, Inc. v. Town of Henrietta, 507 F.3d 778, 788 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal [*21]  quotes omitted).
The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the "materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials" that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see, e.g., Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323; Koch v. Town of Brattleboro, 287 F.3d 162, 165 (2d Cir. 2002). If the non-moving party has the burden of proof on a specific issue, the movant may satisfy its initial burden by demonstrating the absence of evidence in support of an essential element of the non-moving party's claim. See, e.g., Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23, 325; PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 315 F.3d 101, 105 (2d Cir. 2002); Goenaga v. March of Dimes Birth Defects Found., 51 F.3d 14, 18 (2d Cir. 1995). If the movant would have the burden of proof on a targeted claim or issue, it must proffer admissible evidence that, if not contradicted, would suffice to demonstrate that it is entitled to judgment on that claim or issue. See, e.g., Giannullo v. City of New York, 322 F.3d 139, 140-41 (2d Cir. 2003).
If the movant fails to meet its initial burden, the motion will fail even if the opponent does not submit any evidentiary materials to establish a genuine factual issue for trial. See, e.g. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 160, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); Giannullo, 322 F.3d at 140-41. If the moving party carries its initial [*22]  burden, the opposing party must then shoulder the burden of demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact on any such challenged element of its claim or defense. See, e.g., Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 529, 126 S. Ct. 2572, 165 L. Ed. 2d 697 (2006); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323-24; Santos v. Murdock, 243 F.3d 681, 683 (2d Cir. 2001). In doing so, the opposing party may not rest "merely on allegations or denials" of the factual assertions of the movant, see, e.g., Goldstein v. Hutton, Ingram, Yuzek, Gainen, Carroll & Bertolotti, 374 F.3d 56, 59-60 (2d Cir. 2004), nor may it rely on its pleadings or on merely conclusory factual allegations. See, e.g., Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 41 (2d Cir. 2000). It must also "do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); see also Woodman v. WWOR-TV, Inc., 411 F.3d 69, 75 (2d Cir. 2005). Rather, it must present specific evidence in support of its contention that there is a genuine dispute as to the material facts. See, e.g., Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir. 1998); Rexnord Holdings, Inc. v. Bidermann, 21 F.3d 522, 526 (2d Cir. 1994).

II. Applicable Version of the ADA
"When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in the suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach." Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 280, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994). If Congress has not explicitly stated whether the statute is to apply retroactively, it is incumbent upon the court to do so. Id. Courts are guided in this effort by a "presumption against retroactive legislation [that] is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence." Id. at 265. Thus, as a general rule, a statute is not given [*23]  retroactive effect "unless such construction is required by explicit language or by necessary implication." Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U.S. 30, 37, 126 S. Ct. 2422, 165 L. Ed. 2d 323 (2006) (internal quotation omitted).
In 2008, Congress amended the ADA, effective on January 1, 2009. ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, § 8, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008) ("Amendments"). The Amendments significantly altered the original act, expressly overruling Supreme Court precedent that limited the scope of protection provided in the Act. See id. § 2. Congress did not, however, indicate whether the Amendments were to apply retroactively. See, e.g., Wega v. Ctr. for Disability Rights, 395 F. App'x 782, 784 n.1 (2d Cir. 2010). Our Circuit Court has thus held -- in line with every other federal court of appeals to address the issue -- that the 2008 Amendments to the ADA do not apply retroactively. See Parada v. Banco Industrial De Venezuela, C.A., 753 F.3d 62, 68 n.2 (2d Cir. 2014).
There is no dispute in this case that all relevant events occurred prior to the effective date of the 2008 Amendments. (See Def.'s 56.1 Statement; Pl.'s Affirm. in Opp. to Summ. J.). Therefore, we agree with defendant's assertion that the Amendments are inapplicable to this case. (See Def.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Summ. J. 4). We will therefore apply both the original ADA as well as the relevant case law abrogated by the 2008 amendments.

III. Burden-Shifting Framework for Claims of Employment Discrimination
The ADA prohibits discrimination [*24]  "against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).9
Discrimination claims under the ADA are analyzed under the widely-applied burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See, e.g., Heyman v. Queens Vill. Comm. For Mental Health for Jamaica Cmty. Adolescent Program, Inc., 198 F.3d 68, 72 (2d Cir. 1999); Greenway v. Buffalo Hilton Hotel, 143 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 1998); see also Bucalo v. Shelter Island Union Free Sch. Dist., 691 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2012). Though the facts of McDonnell Douglas concerned Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Court there set up a broadly-utilized framework of "the order and allocation of proof in a private, non-class action challenging employment discrimination." McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 800.
The Second Circuit has summarized the McDonnell Douglas framework as follows:
[P]laintiff bears the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. The burden then shifts to defendants, who must offer through the introduction of admissible evidence a non-discriminatory reason for their actions that, if [*25]  believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not a cause of the disputed employment action. Plaintiff must then show that the proffered reason was merely pretext for discrimination.
Heyman, 198 F.3d at 72 (internal citations omitted); see also Bucalo, 691 F.3d at 128 (applying this analysis to the ADEA and Title VII).

A. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case
To satisfy the prima facie burden, the plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant-employer is subject to the ADA; (2) the plaintiff was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) she was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) she suffered an adverse employment action (e.g., was fired) because of her disability. See, e.g., Capobianco v. City of New York, 422 F.3d 47, 56 (2d Cir. 2005); Giordano v. City of New York, 274 F.3d 740, 747 (2d Cir. 2001); Ryan v. Grae & Rybicki, P.C., 135 F.3d 867, 869-870 (2d Cir. 1998); Alford v. Turbine Airfoil Coating & Repair, LLC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53692, 2014 WL 1516336, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 17, 2014); Quintero v. Rite Aid of New York, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130920, 2011 WL 5529818, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 10, 2011); Primmer v. CBS Studios, Inc., 667 F. Supp. 2d 248, 256 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).
The plaintiff's burden of establishing a prima facie case "is not a heavy one." Carlton v. Mystic Transp., Inc., 202 F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir. 2000); see also St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993). The Second Circuit has stated that "[t]he burden of proof that must be met to permit an employment-discrimination plaintiff to survive a summary judgment motion at the prima facie stage is de minim[i]s." Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 37 (2d Cir. 1994) (internal quotations omitted).
For purposes of the current motion, defendant does not dispute that plaintiff satisfies the first and third elements of a prima facie case [*26]  of discrimination under the ADA. (Def.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Summ. J. 6) . Defendant does argue, however, that plaintiff has failed to establish (1) that she was disabled within the meaning of the ADA and (2) that she was terminated because of her alleged disability. We address each of these arguments in turn.

i. Disability Under the ADA
Under the ADA, a disability is defined as (A) "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual," (B) "a record of such an impairment," or (C) "being regarded as having such impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). However, "[n]ot every impairment is a 'disability' within the meaning of the ADA; rather, there are two requirements: the impairment must limit a major life activity and the limitation must be substantial." Capobianco, 422 F.3d at 56. Additionally -- despite the minimal burden of a plaintiff's prima facie case -- the above terms are to be "interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled." Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 197, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002); Troeger v. Ellenville Cent. School Dist., 523 F. App'x 848, 852 (2d Cir. 2013).

1. Definition of "Major Life Activities"
Addressing the first prong of this inquiry, the Supreme Court has unequivocally defined "major life activities" as those "that are of central importance to daily life." [*27]  Toyota, 534 U.S. at 197. Under the applicable EEOC regulations, major life activities include "functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i) (2010).10
This is not an exclusive list. See, e.g., Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 639, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1998) ("the use of the term 'such as' confirms, the list is illustrative, not exhaustive"); Colwell v. Suffolk Cnty. Police Dept., 158 F.3d 635, 643 (2d Cir. 1988); Hazeldine v. Beverage Media, Ltd., 954 F. Supp. 697, 703 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). The Second Circuit has explicitly included sleeping, for example, as a major life activity. Colwell, 158 F.3d at 643 ("[Petitioner] also claims an impairment of his ability to sleep, which is undoubtedly a major life activity."). It has also "assum[ed] without deciding" that sitting, standing, lifting, [*28]  reaching, bending, and the ability to control elimination of waste are major life activities as well. Colwell, 158 F.3d at 642 (citing Ryan, 135 F.3d at 870).11
The Supreme Court has emphasized that the statute should not be interpreted to mean that "activities without a public, economic, or daily dimension may somehow be regarded as so unimportant or insignificant as to fall outside the meaning of the word 'major.'" Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 638. Still, the Second Circuit [*29]  has remarked on "a number of activities that cannot reasonably be deemed major league, such as driving, doing mechanical work on cars, performing housework other than basic chores, going shopping in the mall with his wife, skiing, and golfing." Colwell, 158 F.3d at 643.

2. Definition of "Substantial Limitations"
The EEOC regulations provide significant guidance on whether an impairment "substantially limits" a major life activity. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j) (2011). The term is defined as either of the following:
(i) Unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform; or
(ii) Significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.
Id. at § 1630.2(j)(1). The regulations also add that, in determining whether a plaintiff is substantially limited in a major life activity, the fact-finder should consider the following factors: "(i) The nature and severity of the impairment; (ii) The duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (iii) The permanent or long term impact, [*30]  or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment." Id. at § 1630.2(j)(2).
Significantly, an impairment that requires only that the plaintiff perform the activity in a way different from the average person does not bring that plaintiff within the scope of the ADA. Capobianco, 422 F.3d at 57 (citing Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S. 555, 564-65, 119 S. Ct. 2162, 144 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1999)). The restriction must be "significant." Id.

3. Plaintiff's Alleged Disabilities
In none of plaintiff's submissions to this court does she list or otherwise specifically identify which major life activities she is claiming were impacted by her injuries, let alone to what degree. (See Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp. to Summ. J.) . Her affirmation in opposition to defendant's motion ignores the issue of disability entirely. (Id.) Still, given plaintiff's pro se status, we review the full record of this case for signs of such activities.12
Preliminarily, it is useful to point out which life activities -- "major" or otherwise -- plaintiff is unequivocally not asserting were affected as of the date of her termination. During defendant's deposition of plaintiff, counsel asked whether her impairment had substantially limited her ability to see, hear, think, communicate, speak, breath, read, learn, concentrate, drive, or take care of herself. (Amador Dep. 129-130, 136). To these questions, she unequivocally answered no. (Id.).13

a. Wearing Shoes
Turning to activities that plaintiff suggested were limited by her impairments, we begin with her testimony about wearing shoes.14 A handful of employment-discrimination cases have dealt directly with a plaintiff unable to wear certain types of shoes and, on their facts, have found no substantial limitation on a major life activity. See, e.g., Joseph, 473 F. App'x at 36 (plaintiff unable to wear closed-toed shoes with stockings in the summer); Talk v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 165 F.3d 1021 (5th Cir. 1999) (plaintiff restricted to wearing orthopedic shoes).
Here, plaintiff is claiming nothing more than discomfort or pain when wearing "certain styles of shoe...depending [*34]  on the heel." (Amador Dep. 138-129). No reasonable trier of fact could find this to be a substantial limitation of a major life activity under any reading of these terms.

b. Climbing Stairs
Despite defendant's assertion that the issue is beyond dispute, there is some disagreement among courts in this Circuit as to whether climbing stairs constitutes a major life activity. (See Def.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Summ. J. 11-12).
Some cases, affirmed by the Second Circuit, unequivocally state that it is not. See Watson v. Arts & Entm't Television Network, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24059, 2008 WL 793596, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2008) ("climbing stairs is not a major life activity"), aff'd, 352 F. App'x. 475 (2d Cir. 2009); Piascyk v. City of New Haven, 64 F. Supp. 2d 19, 26 (D. Conn. 1999) ("climbing stairs and ladders...are not major life activities within the meaning of the ADA"), aff'd, 216 F.3d 1072 (2d Cir. 2000).
Other district courts have held to the contrary. See Nodelman v. Gruner & Jahr USA Publ'g, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5398, 2000 WL 502858, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2000) ("The Court finds that climbing stairs qualifies as a 'major life activity.'"); Sussle, 269 F. Supp. 2d at 299 ("Climbing stairs likewise qualifies as a major life activity."). Additionally, one Second Circuit decision has at least hinted that there could conceivably be a factual circumstance in which an inability to climb stairs could constitute a substantial limitation of a major life activity. Rogers v. City of New York, 359 F. App'x 201, 203 (2d Cir. 2009) ("[A]n inability to climb stairs, at least in the circumstances alleged, is [*35]  not a substantial limitation of a major life activity.") (emphasis added).
We do not take the opportunity to weigh in on the issue, however; because even assuming that climbing stairs is a major life activity, plaintiff has not presented evidence upon which reasonable minds could conclude that this activity was substantially limited.
The April 27, 2007 doctor's note submitted by plaintiff to defendant explained that plaintiff should not "walk up several flights of stairs." (Ex. I to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J.). During her deposition, all plaintiff could say on this limitation was that her injury affected her ability to climb stairs "to some degree. It depends on the stairs, how many stairs." (Amador Dep. 152). When directly asked how her injury affected her ability to climb stairs, she answered, "I don't know. Again, I can't specify that." (Id.).
The Second Circuit has been clear: "vague" descriptions of restrictions of major life activities are insufficient to constitute evidence showing substantial limitations of major life activities. See, e.g., Parada, 753 F.3d at 69 ("vague statements about a plaintiff's difficulties...without more, will not suffice to support a finding of an ADA violation"); Colwell, 158 F.3d at 635 ("[Plaintiff's] [*36]  descriptions of his limitations are marked throughout by hedging and a studied vagueness, so that there is no support for the idea that his impairments would be significantly limiting to the average person in the general population." ); see also Baerga, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17201, 2003 WL 22251294, at *7 (doctor's findings too vague to overcome defendant's summary-judgment motion); Piascyk, 64 F. Supp. 2d at 29 ("This testimony is also too ambiguous to support a finding of substantial limitation.").
Plaintiff's vague, non-specific descriptions of her restrictions on climbing stairs could not persuade a trier of fact to find her substantially limited in the activity of climbing stairs.

c. Sleeping
We next turn to plaintiff's asserted difficulty sleeping. As mentioned, the Second Circuit has plainly included sleeping within its list of major life activities. See, e.g., Colwell, 158 F.3d at 643; Felix v. New York City Transit Auth., 324 F.3d 102, 104-05 (2d Cir. 2003). We certainly agree that sleeping is of "central importance to daily life." See Toyota, 534 U.S. at 197.
The plaintiff in Felix was suffering from insomnia induced by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. 324 F.3d at 104-05. In that case, the defendant-employer conceded that this rose to the level of a substantial limitation of the plaintiff's ability to sleep. Id. By contrast -- and more instructive for our purposes -- the plaintiff in Colwell took medication to help with his trouble [*37]  sleeping and stated that "I usually get a tough night's sleep." Colwell, 158 F.3d at 645. The Second Circuit was clear: this was not enough. Id. The Circuit emphasized that the plaintiff had "made no showing that his affliction is any worse than is suffered by a large portion of the nation's adult population...[and] failed to establish that the degree of limitation he suffers is substantial." Id.; see also Reilly v. Revlon, 620 F. Supp. 2d 524, 541 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (medical notes reporting plaintiff's "poor sleep," "decreasing sleep," and "difficulty w[ith] sleep" insufficient to show a genuine issue of a material fact on issue of sleep disability); Dean v. Westchester Cnty. P.R.C., 309 F. Supp. 2d 587, 595 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (allegations that plaintiff suffered from "severe sleep deprivation" was not enough to allege that the degree of limitation suffered was substantial).
Guided by the ADA, the EEOC regulations, and relevant case law, we are persuaded that there are insufficient facts to show that plaintiff's ability to sleep is significantly restricted "as compared to the condition, manner or duration under which the average person in the general population can" sleep. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1). The only extant evidence relating to sleep consists of plaintiff's deposition testimony that she experienced periodic spasms that "come[] and go[]" and that somehow interfered [*38]  with her sleeping (Amador Dep. 130). She could not say how often the spasms occurred (id. 130-32), but she could confirm that any injury-related difficulty sleeping was irregular and "[n]ot [on an] every day basis." (Id. 132). These assertions meet neither the test for sleep as delineated in Colwell nor the similar general formulations set forth in the EEOC regulations.

d. Bending
Next, we turn to plaintiff's assertion in her deposition that her impairments impacted her ability to bend. Following the Second Circuit's direction in Colwell, courts in this district have assumed that bending is a major life activity under the ADA. See, e.g., Cook v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22252, 2005 WL 2429422, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. September 30, 2005); Piascyk, 64 F. Supp. 2d at 25. We agree that bending is of "central importance to daily life" and therefore also assume that it constitutes a major life activity under the ADA. See Toyota, 534 U.S. at 197.
The level of plaintiff's limitation with regard to bending, however, does not rise to the level of "substantial." In Coldwell, plaintiff could "infrequently" bend, though he could not "bend over for long periods." 158 F.3d at 644. Yet, this evidence was held insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find that plaintiff was disabled. Id. at 641. In Hazeldine, a defendant's summary-judgment motion was granted against a plaintiff who could [*39]  only bend "with considerable exertion" and whose doctor had classified her as "fifty percent disabled." 954 F. Supp. at 704. In granting the motion, the district court emphasized that "an impairment may affect an individual's life without becoming disabling." Id. at 703; see also Potenza v. City of New York Dept. of Transp., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17112, 2001 WL 1267172, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2001).
Here, there is no medical evidence relating to plaintiff's inability to bend.15 Additionally, what little deposition testimony there is on the subject is somewhat incoherent. (See Amador Dep. 154-57.). When asked if her ability to bend was substantially limited by her injury, plaintiff replied, "I guess to some degree, because again, if I had spasms, that would be a discomfort." (Id. at 155). She admitted that when not experiencing spasms, she could bend without pain, and that even when she was experiencing spasms, she only had pain "depend[ing] on how I'm bending." (Id. at 155-56). She also somewhat contradictorily stated, that the impact of her bending while experiencing a spasm consisted of "a sharp pain or a discomfort and I would have to, like, either be limited on how far I could bend or if I couldn't at that point bend at all." (Id. at 157).
No reasonable fact-finder could determine -- on this evidence alone -- that plaintiff was disabled under the definitions used by the ADA. At best, plaintiff asserted an impairment that required only that at times she perform "the activity in a way different from the average person." See Capobianco, 422 F.3d at 57.

e. Standing
Even if we assume that standing is a "major life activity" under the ADA, plaintiff's evidence raises no factual question as to whether she was substantially limited in this respect. A number of Second Circuit and district court opinions have included standing in the list of major life activities. See, e.g., Colwell, 158 F.3d at 642; Ryan, 135 F.3d at 870; Sussle, 269 F. Supp. 2d at 298; Batac v. Pavarini Const. Co., Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25765, 2005 WL 2838600, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 27, 2005).16 We certainly agree that standing is of "central importance to daily life." See Toyota, 534 U.S. at 197.
In order for standing to be "substantially limited," a plaintiff must show more than an inability to stand for prolonged periods of time. See, e.g., Colwell, 158 F.3d at 644. In Colwell, one plaintiff could not stand "for a long period of time" and another plaintiff had "difficulty standing in any one particular area for more than an hour at a time." Id. Neither was substantially limited in this activity. Id.; see also McDonald v. City of New York, 786 F. Supp. 2d 588 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (summary judgment against plaintiff unable to stand for prolonged periods); Piascyk, 64 F. Supp. 2d at 29 (same).
Here, plaintiff asserts nothing more than -- at most -- difficulty standing for prolonged periods. (See Exs. G & I to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J.) Her deposition testimony on the subject is vague. (See [*42]  Amador Dep. 110-11; 141-48.) However, she clearly admits that she was not physically unable to stand. (Amador Dep. 143-44). Rather, on occasion, if she stood for some undefined "prolonged" period, she might feel pain or discomfort. (Amador Dep. 143-44). In the March 23, 2007 Physician's Questionnaire, plaintiff's doctor wrote that she could stand for an hour. (Ex. G to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J.). Then, in the doctor's note dated April 27, 2007 -- supplied by plaintiff to defendant when she returned to work on April 30, 2007 -- another doctor wrote that "[t]he patient should not stand for prolonged periods of time."17 As in Colwell, these restrictions do not constitute substantial limitations on plaintiff's ability to stand.

f. Carrying/Lifting
Turning to plaintiff's carrying restrictions, we note that -- like the final two activities listed below -- there can be no dispute that carrying is a "major life activity." The performance of "manual tasks" is explicitly included in the EEOC regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i), and we are satisfied that "carrying" is a task "of central importance to daily life." See Toyota, 534 U.S. at 197.
Nevertheless, an inability to carry or lift ten pounds is not a substantial limitation of those activities. In Colwell, for example, the Second Circuit held that neither the plaintiff who could only lift "light objects," nor the plaintiff who could only lift objects of "maybe ten to twenty pounds" were substantially limited. 158 F.3d at 644. District courts in this Circuit have repeatedly echoed this [*43]  finding. See, e.g., Glozman, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 621 ("The inability to lift heavy objects does not constitute a disability under the ADA."); Hazeldine, 954 F. Supp. at 703-04 (summary judgment against plaintiff who could not lift more than ten pounds); Varre v. City of Syracuse, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2688, 2000 WL 270966, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 2000) (summary judgment against plaintiff who could not lift more than ten pounds); Piascyk, 64 F. Supp. 2d at 29-30 (judgment as a matter of law against plaintiff who could not lift more than fifteen pounds); Zarzycki v. United Technologies Corp., 30 F. Supp. 2d 283 (D. Conn. 1998) (summary judgment against plaintiff who could lift objects "over ten to fifteen pounds").
In our case, plaintiff's doctor wrote in the March 23, 2007 Physician's Questionnaire that plaintiff could lift "10 lbs." (Ex. G to-Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J.). Notably, the April 27, 2007 doctor's note made no mention of any lifting or carrying restrictions. (Ex. I to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J. ) And in plaintiff's deposition, the only references to carrying were related to these documents. (Amador Dep. 109, 148-50, 160, 170-72). As such, plaintiff cannot show that she was substantially limited in her ability to carry.

g. Walking
Walking is a major life activity under the ADA. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2 (i); see also Toyota, 534 U.S. at 197; Capobianco, 422 F.3d at 56; Reeves, 140 F.3d at 150; Sussle, 269 F. Supp. 2d at 299. Nevertheless, an inability to walk long distances or for extended periods of time does not constitute a substantial limitation on an [*44]  individual's ability to walk. See Sussle, 269 F. Supp. 2d at 311 ("The inability to walk long distances...does not in itself substantially limit an individual's ability to perform a major life activity."); Hazeldine, 954 F. Supp. at 704 (plaintiff who could not walk more than five city blocks without resting was not "substantially limited" and could not overcome defendant's motion for summary judgment); Mitchell v. Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20570, 2003 WL 22705121, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2003) (plaintiff unable to do "substantial amounts of walking" could not overcome defendant's motion for summary judgment); Price v. City of New York, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39632, 2013 WL 1182073, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) ("Courts in this Circuit repeatedly have held that the inability to, e.g., walk long distances...does not in itself substantially limited an individual's ability to perform a major life activity."). As summarized in Epstein v. Kalvin-Miller Intern., Inc., 100 F. Supp. 2d 222, 227 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), for this limitation to rise to the level required by the ADA, the plaintiff must be "either totally unable to walk, or [be] significantly limited in comparison with the average person."
The only medical evidence pertinent to plaintiff's walking restrictions is the April 27, 2007 doctor's note. (Ex. I to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J.). There, the doctor wrote that "[t]he patient should not...walk for prolonged periods." (Id.). In plaintiff's deposition, she elaborated on the contours of this limitation. (Amador Dep. [*45]  132-135, 137-41, 160-61). Defendant's counsel explicitly asked her whether she was claiming that her injuries substantially limited her ability to walk, to which she answered "[n]o." (Id. at 141). Plaintiff also confirmed that as of the date of her termination she was fully able to walk. (Id. at 132). She sometimes experienced discomfort or pain when walking longer distances, although she could not specify "what exactly was too long, too short." (Id. at 134). As such, plaintiff's impairment does not rise to the level of a substantial impairment of her ability to walk.

h. Working
Finally, we address the impact that plaintiff's impairment had on her ability to work. Working is, indisputably, a "major life activity." See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i); see also Sutton, 527 U.S. at 491; Capobianco, 422 F.3d at 56; Behringer v. Lavelle Sch. for Blind, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134440, 2010 WL 5158644, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 17, 2010). EEOC guidance on what constitutes a substantial limitation of this particular activity is comprehensive. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j). The regulations define a substantially limited individual in this respect as one who is "significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities." Id. at § 1630.2(j)(3)(i).
Echoing these regulations, the Supreme Court has stated that [*46]  "[w]hen the major life activity under consideration is that of working, the statutory phrase 'substantially limits' requires, at a minimum, that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in a broad class of jobs." Sutton, 527 U.S. at 491.
The regulations further clarify that "[t]he inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (2011). The Supreme Court framed this inquiry as follows:
To be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, then, one must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice. If jobs utilizing an individual's skills are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of different types of jobs are available, one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs."
Sutton, 527 U.S. at 492. The Second Circuit has clarified, however, that to be substantially limited in the activity of working, "it is not necessary that [plaintiff] be excluded from every job for which she is qualified." Bartlett v. New York State Bd. of Law Examiners, 226 F.3d 69, 83 (2d Cir. 1998); see also Kravar v. Triangle Servs., Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26459, 2009 WL 805807, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. March 27, 2009) ("Sutton does not require [plaintiff] to show that she is unable to perform any job, but to introduce evidence from which a jury might rationally conclude [*47]  that she is unable to work in a broad class of jobs.") (internal quotations omitted).
The EEOC regulations state that, when determining whether a plaintiff is substantially limited with regard to working, the fact-finder may consider the following factors:
(A) The geographic area to which the individual has reasonable access;
(B) The job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment, and the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within that geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment (class of jobs); and/or
(C) The job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment, and the number and types of other jobs not utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within that geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment (broad range of jobs in various class).
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(ii) (2011).
The minimal evidence present in this record bearing on plaintiff's work restrictions would not permit any reasonable fact-finder to determine that such restrictions constituted a "substantial limitation" under the ADA.
Plaintiff [*48]  possesses an Associate's Degree in fashion merchandising from Kingsborough Community College. (Amador Dep. 186-87). Prior to her 2007 termination, she had been gainfully employed by defendant since 1996. (Id.; Answer ¶ 9). As defendant stated at her deposition, she "was in retail for many years." (Amador Dep. 186). Plaintiff provided no evidence to this Court about which jobs, if any, she was disqualified from. What does exist is the little contained in the March 23, 2007 Physician's Questionnaire and the April 27, 2007 doctor's note. (Exs. G & I to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J.). Yet, even combining the information in the two notes, plaintiff's work restrictions include only being unable to stand or sit for prolonged periods, lift over ten pounds, walk up several flights of stairs, and being confined to "light duty." (Id.)
By her own admission, she was prepared to work in, and felt qualified for, an administrative position with defendant. (Amador Dep. 36). She also confessed to being fully able to perform any "office work" associated with her old position. (Id. at 161). Additionally, she confidently expressed having experience in event planning and fashion shows -- experience gained through [*49]  her work for defendant -- which she used to apply to positions after her termination. (Id. at 242).
Finally, as far as the geographic area to which plaintiff had reasonable access, she acknowledges that her job searching extended throughout New York and New Jersey. (Amador Dep. 220-21). Even after her injury, nothing changed about the area in which she would be willing and able to work. (Id.) She could travel to any job she could access via public transportation. (Id. at 221).
Taken together, this evidence paints a clear picture -- enough for this court to decide the issue via summary judgment -- that plaintiff was not substantially limited in her ability to work.18

4. The "Record of" Plaintiff's Alleged Disabilities
The second of the ADA's three alternative definitions of a disability requires plaintiff to show there to have been "a record of" an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). Though courts have had less occasion to expand upon this prong than either the first or the third, the Second Circuit has explained that the ADA requires there to have been more than merely a record of the impairment. Colwell, 158 F.3d at 645-46. The record must reflect the same level of disability required for a showing of an actual disability; namely, it must show a substantial limitation of a major life activity. Id.; see also Schapiro v. New York City Dept. of Health, 25 F. App'x 57, 61 n.2 (2d Cir. 2001) ("While [records such as complaints, grievances, records, and Worker's Compensation Board findings] may establish a record of the physical impairment, they do not establish a record that the physical impairment created a substantial limitation.").
Indeed, the EEOC issued substantial guidance on the specific [*52]  topic of the interplay between workers' compensation claims and disability claims under the ADA. EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Sept. 3, 1996). In that notice, the agency came to the same conclusion: "Even if an employee with an occupational injury has a 'disability' as defined by a workers' compensation state, s/he may not have a 'disability' for ADA purposes. Id.; see also Rodriguez v. Steven Schor, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18176, 2011 WL 743476, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. January 21, 2011) ("[A] claim of discrimination under the ADA is entirely different than a workers' compensation...claim.").
Here, as above, plaintiff fails to establish that there was a record of any ADA-defined disability. We have already explained how neither the March 23, 2007 Physician's Questionnaire nor the April 27, 2007 doctor's note make out any substantial limitations of major life activities. See pp. 29-49 supra, § III (A) (i) (3). Similarly, plaintiff's workers'-compensation claim evidence, which she presented to the court -- a letter reflecting "a finding of a 30% schedule loss of use of the left leg" -- also falls short. (See Ex. I to Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J. 9; Amador Dep. 13).

5. Whether Defendant "Regarded" Plaintiff as Disabled
The ADA also provides a third definition of disability, covering those "regarded [*53]  as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). Tellingly, the interpretive guidance on this prong of the definition explains that it was "intended to express Congress's understanding that unfounded concerns, mistaken beliefs, fears, myths, or prejudice about disabilities are often just as disabling as actual impairments, and [its] corresponding desire to prohibit discrimination founded on such perceptions." 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App.
This types of claim "turns on the employer's perception of the employee and is therefore a question of intent, not whether the employee has a disability." Capobianco, 422 F.3d at 57 (quoting Colwell, 158 F.3d at 646). Specifically, the employer must regard the employee as having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, as defined under the ADA. Capobianco, 422 F.3d at 57. A "regarded as" claim requires the employer to have had a misperception that the employee either had a substantially limiting impairment that he or she did not have or else had a substantially limiting impairment that was not in fact so limiting. Sutton, 527 U.S. at 489.
Plaintiff offers no evidence that she was "regarded as" disabled by her employer and thus fails to establish her disability under this prong of the definition as well. There is simply nothing to suggest that defendant regarded her [*54]  as disabled. Indeed, despite plaintiff's confusion over this issue when pressed at her deposition, it is clear that she could not think of any such evidence. (Amador Dep. 189-94).19 Nor does plaintiff offer any arguments to this effect in her opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment.

ii. Circumstances [*55]  Giving Rise to an Inference of Discrimination
Even were we to assume that plaintiff was disabled under one or more of the definitions provided by the ADA, her claim would still fail due to an inability to show that she was terminated because of that disability.
In order for plaintiff to make out a prima facie case for disability discrimination under the ADA, she must show, inter alia, that she suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. See, e.g., Capobianco, 422 F.3d at 56; Giordano, 274 F.3d at 740; Ryan, 135 F.3d at 869-70; Alford, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53692, 2014 WL 1516336, at *6; Quintero, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130920, 2011 WL 5529818, at *6; Primmer, 667 F. Supp. 2d at 256. To satisfy her burden on this element of a prima facie ADA claim, plaintiff "must show that she was terminated under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discriminatory intent." Primmer, 667 F. Supp. 2d at 259. Said differently, "a plaintiff cannot simply rely on the fact that he was terminated. Rather, he must point to facts that suggest the termination was motivated, at least in part, by animus based on his alleged disability." McDermott v. New York City Hous. Dev. Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4349, 2011 WL 167836, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. January 18, 2011).

1. The March 23, 2007 Physician's Questionnaire
On this point, it is helpful at the outset to view portions of a lengthy exchange that took place between defendant's counsel and plaintiff at plaintiff's deposition:
Q. Okay. What facts do you have to support your claim that Macy's terminated your employment [*56]  because of your disability?20
A. Like I said, that's part of why they terminated me. I was still disabled while being employed by them.
(Amador Dep. 16). However one interprets plaintiff's tautological answer, defendant's counsel was unsatisfied and asked the exact same question a second time:
Q. Okay. What facts do you have to support your claim that Macy's terminated your employment because of your disability?
A. Like I said, that's part of why they terminated me. I was still on disability and disabled while being employed by them.
(Id.). Unsuccessful yet again, defendant's counsel pressed on:
Q. Okay. I understand you believe that's why, or part of why Macy's terminated you. I'm asking for the facts that lead you to believe that.
(Id.). And finally, after this third try, plaintiff began to explain what she perceived to be her employer's alleged duplicity:
A. Well, what leads to it is that they're stating that I didn't submit a request for accommodations and that's false. I did, and I will definitely show with the form that I was given for that request and accommodation that there was a disability.
Q. Okay. I'm not asking about accommodations or a request for accommodations, Miss Amador. I'm [*57]  asking for the facts in your possession that lead you to believe that Macy's terminated your employment because of your disability.
A. Right. So I'm explaining that with that form that I had sent them, that they're also basing their determination on, that I didn't submit that. That form clearly shows that there's a disability on there and that was written out by doctor and filled out by him.
Q. Okay. What form are you referring to?
A. This is an accommodation and extension under the ADA and that was given to me. Under the termination letter they're saying they never received -- I never requested that and on that form the doctor would have to fill out, so there's disability proof there.
(Amador Dep. 16-17). The heart of plaintiff's factual argument is clear: She believes that defendant discriminated against her because of her disability, and the lone fact she has to support this causal link is defendant's assertion that it terminated her for failing to file a request for accommodations -- a failure that plaintiff believes non-existent. Defendant says that she did not file the form, whereas plaintiff says she did.
If the allegations were that straightforward, this would be a simpler motion to decide. See, e.g., Primmer, 667 F. Supp. 2d at 261 ("At its core, this case paints the classic he-said/she-said scenario, which involves an assessment of credibility and the resolution of competing inferences from the disputed facts. Neither is for the Court to decide. Accordingly, summary judgment on [plaintiff's] ADA claim must be denied.") (citing Reeves, 140 F.3d at 152; Rodriguez, 72 F.3d at 1061).
Defendant's counsel tries again and again to clarify her position, which is always the same. Plaintiff believes her termination to be due to her disability because defendant alleges that she did not fill out certain forms that she contends that she did complete. (See, e.g., Amador Dep. 19-23).
Finally, defendant's counsel concludes his questioning on this issue:
Q. Okay. So the facts that lead you to believe that Macy's terminated your employment [because of your disability] was, or were, number one, Macy's said that you never requested an accommodation when you did?
A. Right.
Q. And two, the form that your doctor filled out made Macy's aware of your disability?
A. Well, [*59]  they were -- just reconfirmed everything. I mean, the accident didn't -- it happened at Macy's, so they would be aware of my injury from the start.
Q. Okay. Are there any other facts that Macy's terminated you because of your disability?
A. Like I said, them stating that I never requested for accommodations, which the letter clearly states that I did. Shows them -- they would definitely be aware that my doctor filled it out and it would show that there's a disability there.
Q. Okay. I think we've covered that.
A . Okay.
Q. Any other facts that you believe support your claim that Macy's terminated your employment because of your disability?
A. Right now that's what I can think of.
(Amador Dep. 22-23).
We note that plaintiff did indeed submit a request for accommodations when she submitted her Physician's Questionnaire of March 23, 2007. (Ex. G to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J.). But this form in no way informed defendant of a lasting disability or of a request for accommodations for a date beyond April 30, 2007. (Id.). This form does list some restrictions, such as limited ability to stand, sit, and lift. (Id.). However, in answering the question, "Are listed restrictions permanent?" the doctor [*60]  unqualifiedly checked "no." (Id.). The form goes on to ask, "If not permanent, give date restrictions are projected to end." (Id.). The doctor here wrote, "April 30, 2007." (Id.). Additionally, to underscore this last item, the form asks the doctor to write in the "[d]ate employee can return to work." (Id.) Here, too, plaintiff's doctor wrote "4/30/07" without qualification (Id.)
In response to this form, defendant further extended plaintiff's leave through April 29, 2007. (Ex. H to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J.). The letter sent by defendant to plaintiff explained that "You will be expected to return on your first scheduled workday following this date." (Id.).
Defendant plainly and reasonably understood the Physician's Questionnaire to mean that plaintiff could return to unrestricted work by April 30, 2007. (Id.). As mentioned, however, plaintiff seems to have interpreted this form differently. (See Amador Dep. 83-89). Ddring her deposition, plaintiff was repeatedly asked if she understood that the March 23, 2007 form made no mention of continued restrictions past April 30, 2007 -- which made for confused exchanges like the following:
Q. Your doctor was asked, are your restrictions permanent, [*61]  and he was given a choice of yes or no, correct?
A. Right.
Q. And he said no, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And your doctor was asked if your restrictions were not permanent when they were scheduled or projected to end, and your doctor could have put in any date that he or she wanted to, correct ?
A. Right.
Q. And your doctor put in April 30th, 2007, correct?
A. That's the date that says projected, so he kind of felt maybe around April 30th, 2007.
Q . All right. And your doctor was asked when you could return to work, correct?
A. Right.
Q. And your doctor said April 30th, 2007, correct?
A. Umm-hum.
Q . So by late March of 2007 your doctor was advising Macy's that you could return to work on April 30, 2007 without any restrictions; is that right?
A. No.
Q. It's not?
A. No.
(Amador Dep. 83-85). Plaintiff focused on the inclusion of the qualifier "projected" in one of the questions in the doctor's form. (See Amador Dep. 84-89; Ex. G to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J.). She returned to the word again and again during questioning. (Amador Dep. 84-89) ("He projected maybe April 30th, 2007...Well, projected on April 30th, 2007...Well, it says projected to end, not stating completely that it ' s no restrictions at [*62]  all.). The attention paid to whatever vagueness this word may or may not imply, however, does not diminish from the next line on the form:. "Date employee can return to work. 4/30/07." (See Amador Dep. 84-89; Ex. G to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Summ. J.).
Plaintiff returned to this argument again and again in her opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment. (Pl.'s Affirm. in Opp'n to Summ. J. 6-9). She writes, somewhat disjointedly, as follows:
I returned my form & it was approved by Christine Laspina from Central Disability. I came in the day I was scheduled (April 30, 2007) and was sent home, the same day...Ms. Laspina's reason for my termination was 'there was no information from me requesting an accommodation under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA)' My request was approved with restrictions in April, 2007 by Ms. Laspina [.]
(Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J. 6). She also takes the opportunity to repeatedly frame the note she brought with her on April 30, 2007 as nothing but an affirmation of the March 23 form:
I presented my Light Duty Dr. note, (not a vague note with medical restrictions) (ex # ) because I could see Ms. Aiello wasn't informed about my injuries or restrictions [*63]  that were on the Physician's Statement / Certification by my Physician.
(Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J. 8) (emphasis in original).
On June 14, 2007, I received a Shocked, and Upsetting letter from Ms. Laspina. The letter stated I was being terminated, on the bases of 'since there was no information from you requesting an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) How can that be. You approved my accommodation. To state you didn't receive any info concerning an accommodation is False!
(Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J. 9) (emphasis in original).
In order for us to even consider finding that there exists an inference of discriminatory intent, we would need to alchemize a request for accommodations until April 30, 2007 into a request for accommodations indefinitely beyond April 30, 2007. This, we are unable to do. No reasonable fact-finder could interpret the contents of the March 23, 2007 in any way beyond the one: that, whatever plaintiff's limitations were, they were slated to end by April 30, 2007.

2. The Letter from Defendant of May 1, 2007
There is one other possible factual argument that plaintiff may be making with respect to an inference of discriminatory intent. [*64]  She certainly made no mention of this argument when pressed by defendant's counsel in her deposition, nor does she explain it in her opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment. However, scattered throughout the record are certain breadcrumbs that -- in the interests of completeness and for the sake of this court's responsibility vis-à-vis pro se parties -- we take upon ourselves to pursue.
Therefore, although unarticulated by plaintiff, we infer her second argument to be as follows: Defendant asserts that it terminated plaintiff because she failed to supply information about her alleged disability. (Ex. G to Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J.). Specifically, defendant asserts that plaintiff failed to respond to a letter dated May 1, 2007, which asked plaintiff to supply information from her physician about the nature of her restrictions. (See Ex. H to Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J.). This letter asked of plaintiff what had been asked of her on multiple occasions prior; namely, it sought a properly filled-in Physician's Questionnaire. (Id.; see Exs. C & E to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.).
Believing, as she most certainly did, that defendant already had [*65]  whatever information it needed to evaluate her claimed limitations, see pp. 54-61 supra, § III (A) (ii) (1), plaintiff would not know that she was required to send in yet another such form unless she had been so informed via a new request by defendant. Yet, plaintiff claims that she never received the May 1 letter requesting such a submission. (Amador Dep. 113-14). She writes the following in her opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment: "Macy's is stating that this form was sent to my home. I never received this form. I wasn't told by anyone, that a new form was being given to me or that I would have to su[b]mit another form. I was approved!" (Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J. 9).
Defendant, in its reply to plaintiff's opposition to summary judgment, addresses plaintiff's denial of receipt. (Def.'s Reply to Pl. in Supp. of Summ. J. 9). There, defendant delineates a host of authority for the proposition that plaintiff's "general denial [of receipt] is patently insufficient as a matter of law to overcome the presumption of receipt." (Id.) (citing, e.g., Youxin Ma v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 597 F.3d 84, 92 (2d Cir. 2010). In Ma, the Second Circuit summarized the nature of this presumption:
[A] presumption of receipt arises where, as here, the record [*66]  establishes office procedures, following in the regular course of business, pursuant to which notices have been addressed and mailed. To rebut this presumption, a litigant must show that routine office practice was not followed or was so careless that it would be unreasonable to assume that notice was mailed. Mere denial of receipt is insufficient to rebut the presumption.
Ma 597 F.3d at 92 (internal citations omitted); see also Meckel v. Continental Resources Co., 758 F.2d 811, 817 (2d Cir. 1985). However, we note that at least one case from this district stands for the proposition that sworn testimony -- of which deposition testimony is a type -- creates a dispute of material fact on an issue of a plaintiff's receipt or lack thereof of a letter. Capobianco v. Sandow Media Corp., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143337, 2012 WL 4561761, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. September 29, 2012).
We are certainly persuaded that this is a case in which the May 1, 2007 letter was allegedly sent in the regular course of business and pursuant to established office procedures. Those procedures are described in detail in the affidavit submitted by Ms. Grace Sells. (Cert. of Grace Sells in Supp. of Def's Mot. for Summ. J. ¶¶ 9-15). That description is reinforced by the affidavit of Ms. Christine LaSpina, which lays out the events of the specific mailing in question. (Cert. of Christine LaSpina in Supp. of Def's Mot. for Summ [*67]  J.). Indeed, plaintiff was sent numerous other mailings from defendant, all of which arrived at plaintiff's home. (See, e.g., Exs. C & E to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.). Furthermore, by plaintiff's own admission, in the period in question, she was still residing at the very same address at which she had received the earlier correspondence. (Amador Dep. 113).
If the material question were whether plaintiff received this letter, under Capobianco, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143337, 2012 WL 4561761, at *3, plaintiff's sworn denial of receipt would be enough to at least overcome summary judgment. We need not wade into this fray, however. Such a discussion circles the target without quite hitting it. The above cases focus on the respective plaintiffs' receipt of certain letters. See Capobianco, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143337, 2012 WL 4561761, at *3; Ma, 597 F.3d at 92. The issue in those cases is whether the plaintiffs had notice of particular rights. Id. In contrast, in our case, we must determine whether there are any facts that raise an inference of discriminatory intent on the part of defendant. Yet, in the face of substantial evidence by defendant that shows that it did indeed send the May 1 letter, plaintiff only states that she did not receive it. (See, e.g., Certs. of Grace Sells & Christine LaSpina in Supp. of [*68]  Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.; Amador Dep. 113-14). Plaintiff provides no evidence to counter the assertion that defendant followed its stated procedures or that this mailing was somehow anomalous among the others. For purposes of summary judgment, we can take evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant -- but we cannot invent evidence where it does not exist.
Taking all the presented facts in a light most favorable to plaintiff, then, a trier of fact could not reasonably find that defendant sent a letter that plaintiff never received. In any event, the facts presented here in no way raise a plausible inference that suggests that defendant acted toward plaintiff with any kind of discriminatory intent.
Therefore, on this point, too, plaintiff fails to carry her burden to make out a prima facie claim for employment discrimination under the ADA.

B. Defendant's Rebuttal of Plaintiff's Prima Facie Claim
Although we are satisfied that plaintiff does not meet her prima facie burden under the McDonnell Douglas framework, we take the opportunity to note that -- even had she done so -- defendant would easily have been able to rebut the presumption raised by plaintiff's prima facie charge.
 [*69] As framed by the Second Circuit, once a plaintiff supplies prima facie evidence of discrimination, "[t]he burden then shifts to defendants, who must offer through the introduction of admissible evidence a non-discriminatory reason for their actions that, if believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not a cause of the disputed employment action." Heyman, 198 F.3d at 72. Put differently, "we ask whether defendant has introduced evidence that, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason [for the adverse action]." Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 140 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotations and emphasis omitted).
Defendant's evidence is simple and straightforward. Having sent plaintiff yet another request for her doctor to fill out a Physician's Questionnaire -- and having heard nothing from plaintiff on the subject -- it followed its long-time procedures and terminated the employment of the unresponsive employee. (See, e.g., Ex. G. to Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J.; Cert. of Grace Sells' in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. ¶¶ 13-15). The letter requesting submission of this form was sent on May 1, 2007. (Ex. H to Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J.). It gave plaintiff up through May 20, 2007 to submit a new form. (Id.).
Ms. LaSpina states in her affidavit that the May 20, 2007 deadline came and went. (Cert. of Christine LaSpina in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. ¶¶ 14-17). By a letter dated June 14, 2007, Ms. LaSpina then informed plaintiff of her termination. (Id.; Ex. G. to Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J.). Defendant's motivation is clear:
Macy's did not terminate Amador's employment because of any injury she suffered at work, nor was she discharged due to a disability. [*70]  Amador's employment ended because she did not return from a leave of absence and failed to complete a medical questionnaire about her medical condition, which would have allowed Macy's to evaluate when and under what circumstances she could return to work.
(Cert. of Christine LaSpina in Supp. of Def's Mot. for Summ. J. ¶ 17; Cert. of Grace Sells in Supp. of Def's Mot. for Summ. J. ¶ 15; Ex. G. to Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J.).
No reasonable fact-finder could disagree that "defendant has introduced evidence that, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason." See, Holcomb, 521 F.3d at 140 (internal quotations and emphasis omitted). Defendant, therefore, easily rebuts plaintiff's prima facie case -- were she to have sufficiently demonstrated one.

C. Plaintiff's Claim of Pretext
Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, "once the employer has proffered its nondiscriminatory reason, the employer will be entitled to summary judgment (or to the overturning of a plaintiff's verdict) unless the plaintiff can point to evidence that reasonably supports a finding of prohibited discrimination." James v. New York Racing Ass'n, 233 F.3d 149, 154 (2d Cir. 2000) (citing St. Mary's, 509 U.S. at 510-11; Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255-56; Fisher v. Vassar Coll., 114 F.3d 1332, 1336 (2d Cir. 1997)).
This requires the plaintiff "to demonstrate by competent evidence [*71]  that 'the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.'" Patterson v. Cnty. of Oneida, N.Y., 375 F.3d 206, 221 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253). "[I]f the plaintiff has failed to show that there is evidence that would permit a rational factfinder to infer that the employer's proffered rationale is pretext, summary judgment dismissing the claim is appropriate." Patterson, 375 F.3d at 221 (citing Smith v. Am. Express Co., 853 F.2d 151. 154-55 (2d Cir. 1988)).
Having thoroughly reviewed the record before us, we hold that plaintiff has failed to present evidence that would permit a rational fact-finder to make such a determination. We will not here reiterate what was discussed above, pp. 53-68 supra, § III (A) (ii). We simply note that nowhere does plaintiff even suggest that defendant's proffered reason for her termination was a pretext for discrimination against her alleged disabilities and emphasize that the record provides ample support for defendant's proffered explanation of plaintiff's termination.
This is the case even assuming that plaintiff did not in fact receive the May 1, 2007 letter -- and even if defendant did not send it. Plaintiff plainly admits to understanding that she was required to submit further information from her doctor before being allowed to return to work. (Amador [*72]  Dep. 119-20). She had previously received several letters explaining what was necessary for defendant to make a determination about possible accommodations. (See, e.g., Exs. D, G & I to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.). All of these letters had deadlines of at most several weeks and all of which included phone numbers that could be called in case of questions. (Id.). Yet, aside from one call placed to Ms. LaSpina in the week or two following April 30 -- during which plaintiff was told she needed to submit further information from her doctor -- she did not once reach out to defendant to-ask for more time or to inquire after the state of her employment. (Amador Dep. 123-24). She allowed more than six weeks to elapse; and was terminated as a result. (Ex. G to Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp'n to Summ. J.).
Plaintiff "bears the burden to come forward with evidence on which a reasonable jury could conclude that it was discriminatory animus, not the proffered or any other discriminatory reason, that motivated [defendant] to discharge [her]. On the evidence before [us], no reasonable jury could reach that conclusion." Dollar v. Brooklyn Hosp. Ctr., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122780, 2011 WL 5037063, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2011).

IV. Plaintiff's Failure-to-Accommodate Claim
In addition to plaintiff's [*73]  discrimination claims, she claims that defendant failed to accommodate her alleged disabilities. (See Compl. 2; Amador Dep. 23-36). For reasons already noted, plaintiff has not shown that a reasonable fact-finder could determine that she suffered such discrimination under the ADA.
The ADA defines discrimination, inter alia, as a failure to make reasonable accommodations unless undue hardship would result to the employer. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b) (5) (A). In the context of failure-to-accommodate claims, a plaintiff's prima facie burden requires a showing of each of the following:
(1) [P]laintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations.
McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co, Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., Inc., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 20006); see also Rodal v. Anesthesia Grp. of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 2004).
"Generally, it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed." Graves, 457 F.3d at 184 (citing Flemmings v. Howard Univ., 198 F.3d 857, 861, 339 U.S. App. D.C. 110 (D.C. Cir. 1999) ("An underlying assumption of any reasonable accommodation claim is that the plaintiff-employee has requested an accommodation.")) (internal quotations omitted). It is "an employee's [*74]  request for an accommodation [that] triggers a duty on the part of the employer to investigate that request and determine its feasibility." Graves, 457 F.3d at 185 (internal quotations omitted); see also McElwee v. Cnty. of Orange, 700 F.3d 635, 641 (2d Cir. 2012) ("[I]t is generally the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed") (internal quotations omitted).
Courts have repeatedly emphasized that this duty is discharged by an "'interactive process' by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated." Zito v. Donahoe, 915 F. Supp. 2d 440, 446 (S.D.N.Y 2012) (quoting Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000)); see also McBride, 583 F.3d at 99; Nugent v. St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hosp. Ctr., 303 F. App'x 943, 945 (2d Cir. 2008); Goonan v. Fed. Reserve Bank of New York, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99922, 2014 WL 3610990, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2014). Accordingly, employees who are responsible for the breakdown of such a process cannot recover against their employers for failure to accommodate. Nugent, 303 F. App'x at 946; Zito, 915 F. Supp. 2d at 446; Noel v. BNY-Mellon Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115828, 2011 WL 4633884, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2011) (citing Beck v. Univ. of Wise. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996) ("A party that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith. A party that fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may also be acting in bad faith.")).
Finally, the Second Circuit has been clear that an employer's failure to engage in an interactive process, itself, "does not allow a plaintiff to avoid summary j udgment unless she also establishes that, at least with the aid of some identified accommodation, she was [*75]  qualified for the position at issue." McBride, 583 F.3d at 101 (noting the agreement among all other Circuits that have considered the issue); see also Hodges v. Holder, 518 Fed. Appx. 45, 47 (2d Cir. 2013) ("[T]he magistrate judge properly granted summary judgment on plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim...plaintiff must demonstrate the existence, at or around the time when accommodation was sought, of an existing vacant position that he was qualified for and to which he could have been assigned."); McElwee, 700 F.3d at 642 (2d Cir. 2012).
At the outset, we repeat that plaintiff was not disabled as defined by the ADA. See pp. 25-53 supra, § III(A)(i). As such, she cannot make out a prima facie claim for discrimination under a theory of failure to accommodate.
Apart from this finding, it is somewhat difficult to glean from the record before us exactly what plaintiff believes defendant to have done that reflects a failure to accommodate. She checks a box that alleges as much on her pro se complaint form. (Compl. 3). However, she fails to explain what facts she has to support this claim in the statement accompanying her complaint. (See id. 9-10). Nor does she directly address this claim in her opposition to defendant's motion. (See Pl.'s Affirm, in Opp. to Summ. J.).
Moreover, defendant's deposition of plaintiff [*76]  provides little additional clarity on the issue. (See Amador Dep. 23-36). What follows are just a few excerpts of the confused exchange on this subject:
Q. Okay. Are you claiming that Macy's failed to accommodate your disability?
A. They're, they're -- the reason for terminating me is false. They said I never requested it and I clearly have a letter that states that I did.
(Amador Dep. 23).
Q. Okay. So what accommodation did you request that Macy's did not grant to you, if any?
A. What they're stating is that's why they needed to terminate me, because I never submitted [a completed Physician's Questionnaire].
Q. Okay. I understand. I'm trying to focus with these questions, Miss Amador, not on the termination but this failure to accommodate which you say you are claiming in this suit, that's Macy's failed to accommodate your disability. I'm trying to understand, how did Macy's fail to accommodate your disability? You've indicated that you requested an extension that they gave you.
A. That's part of the term -- the reason of their terminating me --
Q. Okay.
A. -- which is false.
(Id. at 27-28).
Q. Did you request an accommodation that Macy's failed to provide?
A. I just stated that they didn't find me any [*77]  kind of work.
Q. Okay. So the accommodation that you asked for was work?
A. No. I didn't ask for, I didn't ask for that accommodation. They didn't come through on that part.
Q. Okay. Did you request any accommodation for your disability?
A. All I, all I -- what I requested was for this form to be given to me so I would have my job.
Q. Okay. Did you request an accommodation that Macy's failed to provide? Yes or no?
A. Again, this is what they gave me so I can keep my job. Again, this is what I submitted --
Q. Okay. This, referring to [the March 16, 2007 from defendant requesting that plaintiff fill out a Physician's Questionnaire]?
A. -- which I -- which also did lead to the termination, them stating that I never requested this, and I did.
Q. Okay. What accommodation did you request of Macy's that the company failed to provide you?
A. Again, I just said they didn't find me work --
Q. Okay.
A. -- and they terminated me on something that is false, that I -- they had to let me go due to me not requesting for this accommodation and I did.
(Id. at 29-30).
Q. Okay. At any point in 2007 did you make a request of Macy's for something relating to your job, some type of accommodation?
A. 2007 in what time? What period? [*78] 
Q. At any time.
A. Is this before my termination or after?
Q. At any point up until your termination.
A. Okay. So prior to the actual termination --
Q. Yes.
A. -- letter was given to me?
Q. Yes.
A. Okay. What was your question again?
(Id. at 31-32) . No matter which way defendant's counsel approached the question, plaintiff's replies were always of the same disoriented type. (See id. 23-36). Still, we can glean one crucial point from this discussion: The facts and theories underlying plaintiff's discrimination claim and plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim are identical. In other words, plaintiff believes she was discriminated against when her employer fired her; and she believes that her employer failed to accommodate her disability by not continuing to employ her.
She never requested an accommodation of a sort different from the extensions of her leave, which -- in addition to the twenty-six weeks given to her automatically by defendant -- were repeatedly provided by defendant before communication between the parties broke down subsequent to April 30, 2007. See pp. 53-70 supra, § III(A) (ii)-(C). Nor does plaintiff present any evidence that demonstrates the existence "at or around the time when accommodation [*79]  was sought, of an existing vacant position that [s]he was qualified for and to which [s]he could have been assigned." Hodges, 518 Fed. Appx. at 47. The legal and factual aspects of a failure-to-accommodate claim are simply ignored by this pro se plaintiff, likely because she misunderstands the distinctions between this claim and the one for general employment discrimination.
Finally, we note that -- even were we able to interpret plaintiff's arrival on April 30, 2007 with her doctor's note as a "request for accommodations" that was not obliged -- she most certainly failed to engage in the "interactive process" required of her under the law. See Zito, 915 F. Supp. 2d at 446. She did not provide defendant with the requested medical information nor did she reach out to ask for additional time to do so -- time that defendant had shown itself willing to provide over and over again. (See, e.g., Exs. C & E to Ganz Cert. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.; Def.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 31, 42; Amador Dep. 123-23). While we do not impute bad faith to her, plaintiff was certainly responsible for "obstruct[ing] or delay[ing] the interactive process," Beck, 75 F.3d at 1135, and is not entitled to relief under the ADA as a result.21

CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed, we grant the summary-judgment motion of defendant Macy's against plaintiff Melinda Amador and dismiss the complaint in its entirety.
