Opinion



ORDER ON CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (D.E. 32) ("Plaintiff's MSJ") and Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (D.E. 34) ("Defendant's MSJ") (together, the "Motions"). The Court has reviewed the Motions and the pertinent portions of the record and is otherwise fully advised of the premises. For the reasons set forth below, this case is DISMISSED for lack of standing.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Except as otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed.

A. The Parties
Plaintiff Patricia Kennedy ("Plaintiff"), by virtue of a spinal injury that limits her mobility, is a person with a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq., ("ADA"). D.E. 33 ¶ 1; D.E. 39 ¶ 1; D.E. 45 at V(1). Plaintiff is an "ADA tester" who visits various places of public accommodation to ascertain whether they are in [*2]  compliance with the ADA. D.E. 35 ¶ 6; D.E. 44 ¶ 6. Plaintiff has filed more than 100 ADA lawsuits. See D.E. 35 ¶ 5; D.E. 35-1 at 91:14-16; D.E. 44 ¶ 5; see also D.E. 34 at 1-2 & n.1 (collecting exemplar cases). Indeed, the Court takes judicial notice that since this lawsuit was filed on October 17, 2018, Plaintiff has filed more than 250 ADA cases in this district alone.1
Defendant, Floridian Hotel, Inc. ("Defendant"), owns and operates the Floridian Hotel (the "Hotel") located in Homestead, Florida. D.E. 45 at V(2). The Hotel is a place of "public accommodation" under the ADA. D.E. 45 at V(3).

B. Plaintiff's Standing
Plaintiff lives in Tamarac, Broward County, Florida. D.E. 35 ¶ 1; D.E. 44 ¶ 1. She has lived there since 1995. D.E. 35 ¶ 2; D.E. 44 ¶ 2. She also works in Broward County and has worked at the same place since 2005. D.E. 35 ¶ 3; D.E. 44 ¶ 3. The distance between Plaintiff's residence and the Hotel is approximately 50-60 miles or about an hour's drive. D.E. 35 ¶ 4; D.E. 44 ¶ 4.
1. Testimony in Floridian I
On March 5, 2018, Plaintiff filed her ADA complaint challenging the accessibility of the Hotel's website: www.floridianhotel.com (the "Website"). See D.E. 1, Kennedy [*3]  v. Floridian Hotel, Inc., No. 1:18-CV-20839-UU (S.D. Fla.) [hereinafter "Floridian I"]. During her September 10, 2018, deposition in that case, Plaintiff testified that she did not recall the last time she stayed in any hotel in Homestead or whether she had ever stayed in any hotel in Homestead, let alone the Hotel. D.E. 35 ¶ 9; D.E. 44 ¶ 9; D.E. 35-2 at 18:7-17, 40:13-19. Plaintiff testified that the reason for her singular visit to the Hotel's website was to facilitate a trip to see a friend whose name she could not remember, whose address she did not know, who lives on a boat somewhere in the Florida Keys, who "moves around a lot," who she has not seen since April 2006, who she did not end up seeing and who she had no firm plans to see again as of January 2017:
Q. How was it that you decide[d] to look at the Floridian Hotel's website?
A. I needed to go down to Miami, so I was searching places where I could stay.
Q. Where in Miami did you need to go down to?
A. Well, I have a friend of mine in the Keys.
Q. Where in the Keys?
A. I don't recall the town . . .
Q. What's his name?
A. I see him in my head. Let me think. Oh, God. That's awful. I can see his face. I can't think of his name . . [*4]  .
Q. But you don't know where in the Keys he lives?
A. No.
Q. So if you don't know where in the Keys he lived, how did you know where to look for a hotel?
A. Because he's on a boat. He's not in the same place all the time . . .
Q. So let me just understand. So you went on the Floridian Hotel's website looking for a hotel for a place that you don't know where you were going?
A. I don't recall now, no.
Q. And you never ended up going down there?
A. Right. I did not . . .
Q. Since that time, January 2017, have you made any firm plans to go back and see this person?
A. No . . . .
D.E. 35-2 at 15:12-19, 16:1-11, 17:24-25, 18:1-6; 32:22-24.
Floridian I was ultimately dismissed for lack of standing. See Floridian I, D.E. 53.
2. Testimony in this Action
In this case, which is centered on the Hotel's alleged physical barriers to access (see Section II, infra), Plaintiff was deposed on June 5, 2019. See D.E. 35-1. A summary of her key testimony from that deposition is set forth below.
a. Past Visit to the Hotel
On October 8-9, 2018—after her deposition in Floridian I—Plaintiff visited the Hotel. D.E. 35-1 at 24:21-24. She did not "know specifically" how long she actually spent at the Hotel at that time, but [*5]  she "would assume two to three hours[.]" Id. at 94:5-9. When asked why she stayed at the Hotel at that time, Plaintiff testified as follows:
Q. And why did you stay at the Floridian?
A. Because it's down in Homestead.
Q. And why were you in Homestead?
A. There's a festival that I've been trying to go to for the past few years.
Q. What festival is that?
A. I believe they call it Redlands Blues and Barbecue Festival.
Q. And when is that festival?
A. April.
Q. Why were you at the Floridian in October of 2018 if the festival is in April?
A. I don't recall exactly.
Id. at 24:25-25:12.
Later, Plaintiff explained that she was at the Hotel only for two to three hours "to look at issues." Id. at 93:10-13. Plaintiff was asked whether she visited the Hotel solely in effort to establish her standing in this suit, testifying:
Q. Why were you down there?
A. I don't recall.
Q. Isn't it true you just went down there so you can stay at the hotel and try and establish standing for your lawsuit against the Floridian Hotel?
[Plaintiff's counsel]: Object to the [form2].
THE WITNESS: I don't go down there that often, so I try to make - when I'm in a particular town make it count.
[Defendant's counsel]: Why did [you] go down [*6]  to Homestead in October, October 8th, 2018?
A. To stay.
Q. To stay at the hotel?
A. Yes.
Q. For the purpose of standing?
[Plaintiff's counsel]: Object to the form.
A. Possibly.
[Defendant's counsel]: Was there any other reason you went down there?
A. I don't recall. I know it was late, I don't -- no.
Id. at 34:10-35:7.
b. Post-Visit Events and Stated Intentions
Since her stay at the Hotel on October 8-9, 2018, Plaintiff has not been back to the Homestead area, let alone the Hotel. D.E. 35 ¶ 16; D.E. 44 ¶ 16. Nor has she since made any reservations to stay at any places in Homestead or south of Homestead. D.E. 35 ¶ 17; D.E. 44 ¶ 17. Plaintiff does not go to Homestead often because "it's a ways" from her home in Broward County. D.E. 35 ¶ 18; D.E. 44 ¶ 18.
Furthermore, Plaintiff has never attended the Redland Blues and Barbecue Festival (the "Festival")—neither before the filing of this lawsuit nor since. D.E. 35 ¶¶ 24, 26; D.E. 44 ¶¶ 24, 26. She does not recall when she first became aware of the existence of the Festival. D.E. 35 ¶ 22; D.E. 44 ¶ 22. She has never purchased tickets for the Festival. D.E. 35 ¶ 26; D.E. 44 ¶ 26. However, Plaintiff made it clear that the Festival is the key reason [*7]  why she believes she has standing:
Q. Why do you believe you have standing with regard to the second lawsuit?
[Plaintiff's counsel]: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Because I went there and I intend to go back.
[Defendant's counsel]: When do you intend to go back?
A. For that Blues and Barbecue thing for sure.
Q. Well, the Blues and Barbecue thing already occurred, it was in April of 2019. Did you go to that Blues and Barbecue thing?
A. I intended to, but I was sick.
Q. So you didn't go to the Blues and Barbecue?
A. No. . . .
Q. When did you find out about the festival?
A. I found out about it before that of course, probably when I was there before, but I've been wanting to go ever since I knew about it. . . .
Q. Did you know about [the festival] prior to October of 2018?
[Plaintiff's counsel]: Asked and answered.
A. I don't know for sure.
[Defendant's counsel]: So you don't know when you first learned about the Blues and Barbecue festival?
A. No. . . .
D.E. 35-1 at 29:21-30:9, 30:13-16, 30:21-31:3. Plaintiff stated that she "want[s] to go" to the Festival in 2020, but whether she was feeling well enough to go would make a "big difference, I mean, you got to feel good so you can enjoy it." Id. at [*8]  43:17-23.
Regarding her friend in the Florida Keys, Plaintiff essentially reiterated her testimony from Floridian I that she could not recall the friend's name and that she hasn't met with the friend anywhere—much less in or near Homestead—since the friend moved to the Keys. See id. at 35:8-36:24.
Finally, Plaintiff was asked about her plans to revisit the Hotel for tester purposes. She testified that she intended to return to the Hotel "[t]o see if there's any improvements." Id. at 107:15-17. Though Plaintiff has records of properties she has sued, which helps her track her initial observations of alleged ADA non-compliance, she only goes back to revisit a property "when [she] need[s] to." See id. at 11:22-12:7, 71:7-14. However, Plaintiff waffled when she was asked to pin down whether her intent to revisit the Hotel was based solely on the Festival or was also for tester purposes:
Q. And do you have any other reason to go down to Homestead other than the Blues and Barbecue festival that you spoke about?
A. Not that I can recall right now. . . .
Q. Why would you want to go back to a hotel that you found not to be accessible for your needs?
A. I still needed to go back for the standing issue. [*9] 
Q. But if the hotel hadn't done anything to change its condition or the non-accessibility, why would you want to go back there?
A. You're right. You're right, why would I want to go back, but I needed to establish standing and that's what I was intending to do.
Q. So when you say you needed to establish standing, what are you referring to?
A. Going back to the property.
Q. But you never went back to the property?
A. Correct, but I intended to.
Q. Okay. And so this was something that was important, this establishing standing; is that correct?
[Plaintiff's counsel]: Object to the form.
A. The Blues and Barbecue was important to me and if I had to stay somewhere then I can do two birds with one stone.
Id. at 38:1-4, 39:25-40:20.
3. Plaintiff's Declarations
In addition to deposition testimony, Plaintiff has submitted three sworn declarations in this case. In her first declaration, dated December 5, 2018,3 Plaintiff swore that she "plan[s] to attend the Redlands Blues & Barbeque Festival in April 2019. It is my intention to return to the Floridian Hotel at that time. I intend [on] making my reservation via one of the on-line systems identified above." D.E. 11-1 ¶ 24.
In the second declaration, dated [*10]  September 19, 2019, she attested that "[a]s of December 2018, I had planned to attend the Redlands Blues & Barbeque Festival held in April 2019. It was my intention to return to the Floridian Hotel at that time. In December of 2018, I, in fact, attempted to make a reservation to do so but was unable to do so because it was too far in advance of the dates on which I planned to stay. I cancelled my plans to attend the festival because of illness." D.E. 33-1 ¶ 9. In the third declaration, dated October 10, 2019, Plaintiff attests in pertinent part that:
10. This lawsuit was filed October 17, 2018. Prior to that date, on October 11, 2018, I intended to stay at the hotel on April 6-7, 2019, and I attempted to reserve a room. However, I was unable to do so because the online reservations system would not allow me. I called the hotel's front desk and was advised that I could not book a room for this date because it was too far ahead for their computer to accept a reservation and that I would have to wait until December or January to try to book a room.
11. Afterward, I decided to go to a Blues Festival in Homestead that was scheduled for April, 2019. I planned to attend this festival and visit [*11]  the hotel during this visit. However, at the last minute I was unable to do so because an unexpected illness prevented me from leaving my house. My decision to go to the Blues Festival was separate from my October 11 decision and attempt to book a room at the hotel for April.
D.E. 42-1 ¶¶ 10-11. The declarations are silent as to Plaintiff's intent to attend the Festival in 2020.
Plaintiff also addressed her system for revisiting properties she has sued as a tester:
12. As an advocate on behalf of the disabled, I recognize the importance of returning to all the properties I had previously sued. The main reason for doing so is that I said I would return and it is important for me to maintain my standing. Without my standing, I would not be able to advocate for the disabled and bring places of public accommodation into compliance with the law. For many years, I had maintained files with regard to each and every property I had ever sued. On each folder, I had indicated the dates of my return. Thus, by this system I was certain I had returned to every property I had previously sued. Also, this system enabled me to ensure that each property I sued would be revisited.
These files were mostly [*12]  kept in a storage unit which was paid for by the City Of Coral Springs. While I kept the most recent files in my house, they would be moved from time to time to the storage unit. Then, in May 2018, the City of Coral Springs informed me that it would no longer pay for the storage unit. A copy of their letter to me is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. I therefore had to remove the files from the unit. I had no space in my home to store the files and had no other place to put them. Therefore, I disposed of them. Thus, for only a short period, I had no system in place for tracking my revisits to properties I had sued. However, as of May 2018, I can say for certain that I had in fact revisited every property I had previously sued because ALL the folders contained revisitation dates. . . .
13. In 2019, after this Court ruled that I lacked standing because I didn't have a reliable system in place, I implemented a new system for tracking cases I had filed and ensuring that I revisited each property. This consists of a list of all cases I had filed. With respect to each case filed, the information indicates the caption, civil action number, name and address of the property, date the suit was commenced [*13]  and closed, and fact that I had returned. With respect to all properties for which I previously had folders, I was able to indicate with certainty that I had revisited the property because all the folders had so indicated. With respect to the properties that had been sued afterward (subsequent to my disposing of the folders), I was able to use more current information to confirm that I had in fact returned after the lawsuit was over. For this reason, I am confident that I have a reliable system in effect to ensure that I have returned, and do return, to absolutely every property I had previously sued.
Id. ¶¶ 12-13; see also D.E. 33-1 ¶ 4 ("If a law suit is filed to bring the facility or website into compliance, I subsequently revisit each property to ascertain whether the ADA violations have been fixed.").

II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On October 17, 2018, Plaintiff filed her two-count complaint against Defendant, seeking injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that Defendant violated Title III of the ADA because (1) the Hotel contains myriad physical barriers to access by individuals with disabilities and (2) the Website remained non-compliant as alleged in Floridian I. See D.E. 1. On April 3, 2019, the [*14]  Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss the Website claim but permitted the physical barriers claim to proceed except insofar as Plaintiff vaguely alleged that Defendant "fails to adhere to a policy, practice and procedure to ensure that all goods, services and facilities are readily accessible to and usable by the disabled" and "fails to maintain its features to ensure that they are readily accessible and usable by the disabled." See D.E. 14. Given the early stages of the proceeding and the lack of any factual challenge to standing on Count One, the Court in a footnote commented: "Because Defendant only challenges Plaintiff's standing as to Count Two, and as the Court is satisfied Plaintiff has standing to bring Count One's ADA barriers to access claim by virtue of her having visited the Property and intending to return in 8 months, the Court does not address whether Plaintiff has standing to bring Count One." Id. at 6 n.1.
On April 12, 2019, Defendant filed its answer to the remaining Count One of Plaintiff's complaint. D.E. 15. The parties timely filed their summary judgment Motions pursuant to this Court's Scheduling Order for Pretrial Conference and Trial. D.E. 22; D.E. 32; [*15]  D.E. 34. The Motions are now ripe for disposition.

III. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENTS
In Plaintiff's MSJ, Plaintiff argues that she is entitled to summary judgment on her remaining claim for injunctive relief because there is no genuine dispute as to each of the elements of her ADA Title III claim: that she is disabled, that the Hotel is a place of public accommodation, and that that when she visited the Hotel she was denied full and equal treatment because of her disability. D.E. 32.
In Defendant's MSJ, Defendant responds that that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring her barriers to access claim because Plaintiff has not produced evidence demonstrating that she will be subject to a real and immediate threat of future injury. D.E. 34.
Because standing is jurisdictional, the Court will first evaluate Defendant's MSJ—that is, whether Plaintiff has standing to bring her claim—before turning to Plaintiff's MSJ—that is, the merits of her claim. Cone Corp. v. Fla. Dep't of Transp., 921 F.2d 1190, 1203 n.42 (11th Cir. 1991) ("Because standing is jurisdictional, a dismissal for lack of standing has the same effect as a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)."); Cuban Am. Bar Ass'n, Inc. v. Christopher, 43 F.3d 1412, 1422 (11th Cir. 1995) ("[B]efore rendering a decision ... every federal court operates under an independent obligation to [*16]  ensure it is presented with the kind of concrete controversy upon which its constitutional grant of authority is based. . . .") (quotation omitted).

IV. LEGAL STANDARD: RULE 12(b)(1), NOT RULE 56
As a preliminary matter, the Court construes Defendant's MSJ as a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Cf. Brother v. Rossmore Tampa Ltd. P'Ship, No. 8:03CV1253T-24MAP, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28524, 2004 WL 3609350, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 19, 2004) ("Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, in which it argues that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue his claims. While Defendant's arguments are contained in a motion for summary judgment, the Court construes the motion as a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)."). Defendant's MSJ speaks only to Plaintiff's standing to sue; standing "is a doctrine that stems directly from Article III's case or controversy requirement, and thus it implicates our subject matter jurisdiction." Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, 405 F.3d 964, 974 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotations omitted).
This construction is "germane" because "there are significantly different standards" governing summary judgment motions under Rule 56 and motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). Morrison v. Amway Corp., 323 F.3d 920, 924 (11th Cir. 2003). As the Eleventh Circuit explained in Morrison, when a district court considers a Rule 12(b)(1) motion lodging a factual challenge to subject matter jurisdiction [*17]  (rather than a facial challenge), the district court can independently weigh the facts and evidence—whereas such weighing is prohibited under Rule 56:
The district court should only grant summary judgment under Rule 56 where the record evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In ruling on a Rule 56 motion, the district court may not weigh the evidence or find facts. Instead, the court's role is limited to deciding whether there is sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable juror could find for the non-moving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).
Jurisdictional challenges, on the other hand, can be decided without reference to the merits of the underlying claim and lie within the exclusive province of the trial court. Consequently, when a defendant properly challenges subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) the district court is free to independently weigh facts, and
may proceed as it never could under Rule 12(b)(6) or Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Because at issue in a factual 12(b)(1) motion is the trial court's jurisdiction—its very power to hear the case—there is substantial authority that the trial court is free [*18]  to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case. In short, no presumptive truthfulness attaches to plaintiff's allegations, and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of the jurisdictional issue.
Lawrence v. Dunbar, 919 F.2d 1525, 1529 (11th Cir. 1990) (quotation omitted).
Id. at 924-25 (footnote omitted).
The district court may apply the Rule 12(b)(1) standard so long as "the facts necessary to sustain jurisdiction do not implicate the merits of plaintiff's cause of action." Id. at 925 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Garcia v. Copenhaver, Bell & Assocs., M.D.'s, P.A., 104 F.3d 1256, 1261 (11th Cir. 1997)). In deciding whether the standing analysis is "purely jurisdictional," the Court considers whether the challenged facts implicate the elements of the statute at issue: "jurisdiction becomes intertwined with the merits of a cause of action when 'a statute provides the basis for both the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal court and the plaintiff's substantive claim for relief.'" Id. at 926 (quoting Garcia, 104 F.3d at 1262). For example, the jurisdictional challenge in Garcia was based on the defendant's argument that it was not an "employer" within the meaning of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") because it employed an insufficient number of employees to meet the statutory definition of that term. 104 F.3d at 1257-58, 1261. Looking [*19]  to the text of the ADEA, the Eleventh Circuit held that whether the defendant was an "employer" implicated a necessary element of the plaintiff's ADEA claim, such that the 12(b)(1) standard should not have been used. See id. at 1258-67. Likewise, in Morrison, the standing challenge was based on the plaintiff's alleged status as an eligible employee under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA")—a challenge "materially indistinguishable from Garcia" such that the 12(b)(1) standard could not have been used. 323 F.3d at 927-30.
Here, the merits of Plaintiff's ADA claim are premised on 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182 and 12183. See generally D.E. 1; D.E. 32 at 3. Section 12182 applies to the extent that Defendant allegedly failed to remove barriers where such removal is readily achievable. See 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). Section 12183 applies to the extent that the Hotel, or portions thereof, were designed, constructed or altered after January 26, 1993, in a manner that was not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. See 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a). The elements of Plaintiff's claim therefore are: (1) Plaintiff was a disabled individual, (2) the Hotel is a place of public accommodation, and (3) Defendant discriminated against the plaintiff within the meaning of the ADA. See Norkunas v. Seahorse NB, LLC, 444 F. App'x 412, 416 (11th Cir. 2011). In other words, for Plaintiff to establish an ADA violation, Defendant [*20]  must have discriminated against Plaintiff in the past.
Unlike in Garcia and Morrison, the standing challenge lodged here is purely jurisdictional. The parties agree that Plaintiff is a disabled individual and the Hotel is a place of public accommodation. D.E. 45 at V(1), (3). And for purposes of its MSJ, Defendant appears to concede that Plaintiff suffered past injury when she encountered barriers at the Hotel; Defendant challenges only whether Plaintiff faces a "real and immediate threat of future injury" based on her unlikelihood of ever returning to the Hotel. See D.E. 34. This is a standing inquiry only and is not an element of Plaintiff's ADA claim. Compare Taggart v. Colonial Hotel, Inc., No. 06-80018-CIV-WJZ, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116091, 2007 WL 9702259, at *1-2 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 29, 2007) (where standing challenge is based on particularized and concrete threat of future injury, the Court would apply Rule 12(b)(1) standard and "will not assume that the facts set out are true" (quoting Morrison, 323 F.3d at 925)) with Barberi v. Tax Conneck USA Inc., No. 19-cv-61696-GAYLES, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176431, 2019 WL 5079541, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 10, 2019) (Rule 12(b)(1) standard would not apply where jurisdictional challenge was based on dispute over whether Plaintiff actually visited the property in the past, such that he would not have actually suffered "discrimination" under the ADA); Petinsky v. 1800 Palm, LLC, No. 13-23516-CIV, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174686, 2013 WL 6576863, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 13, 2013) (Rule 12(b)(1) standard would not apply where jurisdictional challenge was based on dispute over whether the barbershop restroom [*21]  was a "place of public accommodation" under the ADA).
Accordingly, the Court can and will apply the 12(b)(1) standard, including by exercising the Court's "free[dom] to independently weigh facts...[and] evidence." Morrison, 323 F.3d at 925.

V. DISCUSSION
Having established the proper standard, the Court now begins its standing inquiry.
1. Standing Elements
As set forth by the Supreme Court in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, Article III standing requires a plaintiff to have "(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision." Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, --- U.S. ---, 136 S.Ct. 1540, 194 L. Ed. 2d 635, (2016). In addition, when a party seeks injunctive relief, it must show "that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes—that the injury is certainly impending." Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 185 L. Ed. 2d 264 (2013). "Each element [of standing] must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation." Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (citation omitted). Accordingly, given Defendant's factual challenge to standing after the close of discovery, Plaintiff must show, using affidavits and other evidence, that [*22]  she suffered an injury in fact.
2. Injury-in-Fact
In order to demonstrate standing, Plaintiff must show that she has suffered an "injury in fact." Mulhall v. UNITE HERE Local 355, 618 F.3d 1279, 1286 (11th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). To establish an injury in fact, Plaintiff must show that she has suffered "an invasion of a legally protected interest" that is "concrete and particularized" and "actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical." Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1548 (citation omitted). For an injury to be "particularized," it "must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way." Id. (citation omitted). "A 'concrete' injury must be 'de facto'; that is, it must actually exist." Id. (citation omitted). As mentioned above, because Defendant's MSJ is based only on the threat of future injury (discussed below), Defendant appears to concede that Plaintiff's past encounter of barriers to access during her stay on October 8-9, 2018, satisfies the past injury-in-fact element of standing.
3. Threat of Future Injury
"In addition to past injury, a plaintiff seeking injunctive relief 'must show a sufficient likelihood that [s]he will be affected by the allegedly unlawful conduct in the future.'" Houston v. Marod Supermarkets, Inc., 733 F.3d 1323, 1328-29 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting Wooden v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 247 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001)). Here, because Plaintiff is seeking forward-looking injunctive relief, [*23]  her past injury-in-fact is insufficient to confer standing; she also needs to show that she faces "a real and immediate—as opposed to a merely conjectural or hypothetical—threat of future injury." Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting Shotz v. Cates, 256 F.3d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir. 2001); Wooden, 247 F.3d at 1284).
In the context of the Title III of the ADA, the Eleventh Circuit has clarified that, prior to bringing suit, a Plaintiff must "have attempted to return to the non-compliant [facility] or at least intend to do so in the future." Houston, 733 F.3d at 1336 (quotation omitted). Defendant correctly notes that courts are generally guided by four factors in making this determination: (1) the proximity of the defendant's business to the plaintiff's residence; (2) the plaintiff's past patronage of the defendant's business; (3) the definiteness of the plaintiff's plan to return; and (4) the frequency of the plaintiff's travel near the defendant's business. See id. at 1327, 1337 n.6. However, these factors are merely guidelines, and the Court will consider the "totality of the circumstances" in determining if Plaintiff has adequately demonstrated a "real and immediate" threat of future injury. Kennedy v. Schling LLC, No. 6:17-CV-74-ORL-22TBS, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 218526, 2017 WL 6597119, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 14, 2017) ("District courts must consider the totality of all relevant facts to determine whether a plaintiff faces a real and immediate threat [*24]  of future injury.") (quotation omitted); see also Kennedy v. Beachside Commercial Properties, LLC, 732 F. App'x 817, 821 (11th Cir. 2018) ("In taking all of the factual allegations and the totality of the circumstances into consideration, we conclude that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a 'real and immediate threat of future injury' and thus cannot meet the requirements for standing.") (quotation omitted) (emphasis added); Alvey v. Gualtieri, No. 8:15-CV-1861-T-33AEP, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143957, 2016 WL 6087874 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 18, 2016) (considering plaintiff's deficient allegation that she would need to stay at homeless shelter "at some point in the future," in addition to her lack of history of homelessness and distance from homeless shelter in determining that Plaintiff had not adequately pled threat of future injury to justify standing for injunctive relief).
a. Parties' Arguments
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not demonstrated a real and immediate threat of future injury because the record evidence does not satisfy the Houston factors. See D.E. 34 at 8-16. In support, Defendant points to the substantial distance between Plaintiff's home and the Hotel, her singular pre-suit visit to the Hotel, her dubious self-serving statements about her intent to return to the Hotel, her tester motive and unreliable testing "system," and her infrequency of travel to the Homestead area. [*25]  See id.
Plaintiff argues that the Court cannot make credibility determinations and that the evidence sufficiently demonstrates, as of the time the Complaint was filed, that Plaintiff had the requisite intent to return to the Hotel. See D.E. 42 at 3-6. Plaintiff also argues that she has sufficiently changed her tracking system to ensure that she will return. Id. at 6-8. Finally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant misapplies the Houston factors. Id. at 8-10.
b. Stage of Litigation
As an initial matter and as Defendant correctly notes, this case is no longer at the pleading stage and the Court is not required to accept Plaintiff's factual allegations as true. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 ("At the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may suffice . . . In response to a summary judgment motion, however, the plaintiff can no longer rest on such mere allegations, but must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts.") (quotation omitted).
Moreover, because Defendant's MSJ speaks to this Court's subject matter jurisdiction, the Court is free to—and indeed, must—weigh the facts and evidence to be sure that it has the constitutional authority to adjudicate [*26]  the claims. This includes making credibility determinations. See, e.g., Norkunas v. Seahorse NB, LLC, 720 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1314-19 (M.D. Fla. 2010) (considering credibility in analyzing threat of real and immediate future ADA injury), aff'd 444 F. App'x 412 (11th Cir. 2011); see also Lamb v. Charlotte Cty., 429 F. Supp. 2d 1302, 1305 (M.D. Fla. 2006) (recognizing court's authority to "delve[] into the arguments asserted by the parties and the credibility of the evidence presented"). To the extent some district courts have concluded that credibility determinations are impermissible when considering standing, see, e.g., Access Now, Inc. v. S. Fla. Stadium Corp., 161 F. Supp. 2d 1357, 1364 (S.D. Fla. 2001),4 those cases are non-binding and run contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's instruction in Morrison that "the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of the jurisdictional issue." 323 F.3d at 925 (citing Lawrence, 919 F.2d at 1529); accord Rosenkrantz v. Markopoulos, 254 F. Supp. 2d 1250, 1252 (M.D. Fla. 2003) (because a factual challenge to standing requires the plaintiff to prove its standing by a preponderance of the evidence, "[t]his burden means that a trial court can evaluate a jurisdictional claim even when material issues of fact exist.").
Finally, the Court declines Plaintiff's invitation to read Bischoff v. Osceola Cty., Fla., 222 F.3d 874 (11th Cir. 2000), as requiring an evidentiary hearing in this case. Bischoff is a case where the district court sua sponte dismissed the case for lack of standing based [*27]  only on two conflicting affidavits and no oral testimony. See id. at 875-76. The Eleventh Circuit held that where "the evidence relating to standing is squarely in contradiction as to central matters and requires credibility findings, a district court cannot make those findings simply by relying on the paper record but must conduct a hearing at which it may evaluate the live testimony of the witnesses." Id. at 881. There, the paper record on which the district court relied presented material conflicts as to the events that actually occurred: "for example, while the officers state that only individuals who entered the roadway and impeded traffic were arrested, Plaintiffs say that the individuals who were arrested did not impede traffic and, notably, that Benham never left the grassy median." Id. at 882. Here, by contrast, the parties do not genuinely dispute the underlying facts, such as that Plaintiff has never been to the Festival and doesn't often visit the Homestead area; they simply dispute the inferences to be drawn from those facts. Moreover, the paper record before this Court contains more than just competing affidavits; it contains two complete deposition transcripts wherein Plaintiff was offered ample opportunity [*28]  to provide the facts supporting standing. This is not a case, like Bischoff, where an evidentiary hearing is necessary, because the evidence is already well developed.
c. Totality of the Circumstances
Considering the totality of the circumstances and the record evidence, at this stage of the litigation, the Court does not find that Plaintiff has demonstrated a real and immediate threat of future injury.
i. Proximity of Hotel to Plaintiff's Residence
The first Houston factor, "the proximity of the defendant's business to the plaintiff's residence," 733 F.3d at 1327, 1337 n.6, is unhelpful in assessing the risk of future injury when visiting a hotel—an establishment that a person would visit necessarily when she is far from home. See D.E. 42 at 8-9 (citing cases). The section of Defendant's MSJ devoted to this factor mostly includes facts relevant to the other factors—e.g., definitiveness of Plaintiff's plan to return and frequency of travel near the Hotel—so the Court will address such facts in the labelled sections below. However, the Court notes that even though the first Houston factor is inapplicable, this does not bring Plaintiff any closer to carrying her burden of demonstrating a risk of future injury.
ii. [*29]  Past Patronage
Plaintiff only visited the Hotel once before filing suit (for an estimated 2-3 hours) and cannot claim that this singular past visit is sufficient to indicate future injury. Beachside Commercial Properties, LLC, 732 F. App'x at 821 ("[P]laintiff only visited the allegedly non-complaint premises once before filing her complaint (and even her amended complaint) and thus cannot claim that her singular past injury presents evidence suggesting future injury."); Compare Shotz, 256 F.3d at 1082 (holding that one visit to a non-complaint facility without an expressed intent to return was "conjectural, hypothetical, or contingent"), with Houston, 733 F.3d at 1336 (holding that plaintiff's multiple visits to the non-compliant premises prior to filing suit demonstrated a "real and immediate" threat of future discrimination) (emphasis added); Bodley v. Plaza Mgmt. Corp., 550 F.Supp.2d 1085, 1088 (D. Ariz. 2008) ("While a single visit does not preclude a finding of standing, the lack of a history of past patronage seems to negate the possibility of future injury at that particular location.") (internal citations and quotations omitted).
iii. Frequency of Travel Near the Hotel
Plaintiff rarely visits the area near the Hotel. During her September 10, 2018, deposition in Floridian I, Plaintiff testified that she did not recall the last time she stayed in any [*30]  hotel in Homestead or whether she had ever stayed in any hotel in Homestead. D.E. 35 ¶ 9; D.E. 44 ¶ 9; D.E. 35-2 at 18:7-17, 40:13-19. Since her stay at the Hotel on October 8-9, 2018, Plaintiff has not been back to the Homestead area, let alone the Hotel. D.E. 35 ¶ 16; D.E. 44 ¶ 16. Nor has she since made any reservations to stay at any places in Homestead or south of Homestead. D.E. 35 ¶ 17; D.E. 44 ¶ 17. Plaintiff does not go to Homestead often because "it's a ways" from her home in Broward County. D.E. 35 ¶ 18; D.E. 44 ¶ 18.
Though Plaintiff does offer some self-serving conclusory evidence that she has "been to Homestead approximately 100 times," D.E. 42-1 ¶ 3, there is no evidence of why or when those visits occurred (including how recently those visits occurred), let alone that those visits would lead her to the Hotel or otherwise prompt her to visit the Hotel. Particularly in light of the more specific evidence that Plaintiff infrequently travels near the Hotel, this factor cuts against a finding of a real and immediate threat of future injury.
iv. Reasons for Future Visits
The most robust factor for this Court to consider in determining whether Plaintiff has shown a real and immediate [*31]  threat of future injury is whether Plaintiff has reasons for future visits to the Hotel. "[A] plaintiff's reason for returning to defendant's place of business is a factor to be considered in the standing analysis." Schling LLC, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 218526, 2017 WL 6597119, at * 6. The evidence reflects only three potential reasons for Plaintiff to visit the Hotel in the future: (1) to see her unidentified friend in the Keys, (2) to attend the Festival, and (3) as an ADA tester. The Court addresses each in turn.
First, the Court does not credit Plaintiff's claim that she intends to stay at the Hotel when she visits her "friend" in the Keys or in Homestead. Again, in Floridian I, Plaintiff testified that the reason for her singular visit to the Hotel's website was to facilitate a trip to see a friend whose name she could not remember, whose address she did not know, who lives on a boat somewhere in the Florida Keys, who "moves around a lot," who she has not seen since April 2006, who she did not end up seeing and who she had no firm plans to see again as of January 2017. See Section I.B.1, supra. In her deposition in this case, Plaintiff essentially reiterated her testimony from Floridian I that she could not recall the friend's name and that she [*32]  hasn't met with the friend anywhere—much less in or near the Hotel—since the friend moved to the Keys. See D.E. 35-1 at 35:8-36:24. And in opposing Defendant's MSJ, Plaintiff seems to have abandoned her reliance on her unidentified friend to support her standing. See generally D.E. 42. Thus, even if Plaintiff truly did harbor a desire to see this friend, the fact that she has not seen this friend in years renders this desire too speculative or contingent to support a real and immediate threat of encountering discrimination at the Hotel. See Emory v. Peeler, 756 F.2d 1552 (11th Cir. 1985) (explaining that the threat of future injury "may not be conjectural, hypothetical, or contingent; it must be real and immediate, and create a definite, rather than speculative threat of future injury."); (emphasis added); see also Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300, 118 S. Ct. 1257, 140 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1998) (holding that "a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); Steven Brother v. Tiger Partner, LLC, 331 F. Supp. 2d 1368, 1375 (M.D. Fla. 2004) (holding plaintiff had not shown a real and immediate threat of future injury because "[h]is explanation for his first visit . . . is incredulous, as is his desire to return to that facility."); Access 4 All v. Oak Spring, Inc., No. 504CV75OCGRJ, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20218, 2005 WL 1212663, at *4 (M.D. Fla. May 20, 2005) (granting [*33]  summary judgment because "[o]ther than Mr. Esposito's bald assertion that he plans to return to the Howard Johnson, Plaintiffs have presented no evidence of a threat of future injury, and, in fact, the record evidence establishes that the possibility of future injury is speculative at best.").
Next, the Court does not credit Plaintiff's purported desire to stay at the Hotel to attend the Festival. Plaintiff has never actually attended the Festival. D.E. 35 ¶¶ 24, 26; D.E. 44 ¶¶ 24, 26. She does not recall when she first became aware of the existence of the Festival. D.E. 35 ¶ 22; D.E. 44 ¶ 22. She has never purchased tickets for the Festival. D.E. 35 ¶ 26; D.E. 44 ¶ 26. Nor is there any evidence, for example, that Plaintiff has attended other barbecue and/or blues festivals, or even that Plaintiff is a big fan of barbecue food and/or blues music. To the contrary, the Court finds Plaintiff's professed intent to go to the Festival to be "merely a convenient statement in an attempt to satisfy the standing requirement." Brother v. Rossmore Tampa Ltd. P'ship, No. 8:03CV1253T-24MAP, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28524, 2004 WL 3609350, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 19, 2004).
Further, when Plaintiff first visited the Hotel, it was in October 2018, even though the Festival is in April; when asked about this discrepancy, Plaintiff could provide [*34]  no answer. See D.E. 35-1 at 24:25-25:12. If the Festival truly was her motivation for visiting the Hotel, Plaintiff would have gone to the hotel closer in time to April. And though Plaintiff claims that on October 11, 2018, she tried to reserve a room for April 6-7, 2019 but could not because the date was too far in the future for the computer system to accommodate her request, see D.E. 42-1 ¶ 10, she disavows any relationship between that booking attempt and the Festival, see id. ¶ 11 ("My decision to go to the Blues Festival was separate from my October 11 decision and attempt to book a room at the hotel for April."). There is no evidence that Plaintiff tried at a later date to reserve a room so that she could go to the Festival in April. Moreover, Plaintiff ultimately did not attend the Festival in 2019 due to illness, and whether she is feeling well enough to attend the Festival in 2020 will make a "big difference, I mean, you got to feel good so you can enjoy it." D.E. 35-1 at 43:17-23. Absent a more concrete plan to attend the Festival, Plaintiff's desire to attend the Festival is too contingent and speculative to support a risk of encountering future injury at the Hotel; it [*35]  is merely the kind of "someday" intention that Lujan holds cannot support standing.
Finally, the Court discredits Plaintiff's claim that she will definitely return to the Hotel in the immediate future because she is an ADA tester. Certainly, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that her status as an ADA tester could, at least in theory, militate toward finding that she has a definite intent to return to the Hotel as part of her routine ADA testing. See Houston, 733 F.3d at 1336 (explaining that plaintiff's status as a tester indicated that he would revisit the property many times and therefore tended to show a real and immediate threat of future injury). However, Plaintiff's status as an ADA tester does not automatically imbue her with standing for her claims, as the Eleventh Circuit noted: "Each plaintiff must establish standing on the facts of the case before the court. That is equally as true about a regular customer of a public accommodation as it is for a tester." Houston, 733 F.3d at 1340.
Here, Plaintiff's status as a serial litigant and her haphazard approach to ADA testing is unlikely to lead her to revisit the Hotel. First, the Court takes judicial notice of the fact that in this district alone, Plaintiff has brought at least 250 [*36]  ADA suits (though some merely challenge website accessibility rather than properties' physical barriers to access), indicating that Plaintiff does not actually intend to revisit all of the subject properties. See Brother v. CPL Investments, Inc., 317 F. Supp. 2d 1358, 1369 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (finding plaintiff lacked a credible intent to return to the facility because "in the last year, he has been a plaintiff in more than 50 other suits in Florida which were brought pursuant to the ADA."); Tiger Partner, LLC, 331 F. Supp. 2d at 1374 (granting summary judgment because plaintiff had not shown a real and immediate threat of future injury as he was "involved in a multitude of lawsuits against the hotel industry . . . [and] Mr. Brother has professed an intent to return to all fifty-four of the properties he has sued. This is simply implausible."); Rossmore Tampa Ltd. P'ship, No. 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28524, 2004 WL 3609350, at *4 ("The Court, however, finds that Plaintiff's professed intent to return to Defendant-hotel lacks credibility. Plaintiff has been a plaintiff in over seventy suits against places of public accommodations brought pursuant to the ADA."); Access 4 All, No. 504CV75OCGRJ, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20218, 2005 WL 1212663, at *5 ("[I]n order to attempt to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of Article III, Mr. Esposito has stated that he intends to return in the future to the approximate one-hundred hotels that he has sued. While this may be so, the Court [*37]  . . . [finds] that such a contention is simply implausible and in any event is insufficient to evidence the required threat of future injury to establish standing."); Harris v. Stonecrest Care Auto Ctr., LLC, 472 F. Supp. 2d 1208, 1213 (S.D. Cal. 2007) ("While the Court acknowledges Mr. Harris' right to file ADA lawsuits to remedy denial of access violations, the reality is he has sued so many different establishments that it is impossible to believe he routinely visits the same establishments . . . ."); Molski v. Mandarin Touch Rest., 385 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1046 (C.D. Cal. 2005) ("A serial plaintiff's extensive litigation history can undermine his professed intent to return . . . As a result, Mr. Molski's professed intent to return to the Mandarin Touch is insufficient to establish standing . . . Molski's expressed intent to return to 400 or more businesses spread across the entire state of California is even more questionable."); D'lil v. Best Western Encina Lodge & Suites, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36068, 2006 WL 197143, (C.D.Cal.2006) ("When asked if she was involved in 62 prior lawsuits, Plaintiff replied, "I think so." In short, it appears Plaintiff declares that she intends to return to nearly every place she sues . . . While some of these allegations may have initially been accepted in other cases without question, even at the trial stage, as more suits are filed and more—and contradictory—allegations are made, credibility concerns increase.") [*38]  (internal citations omitted ).
Further, despite this multitude of lawsuits, Plaintiff's purported "system" for revisiting non-compliant properties does not provide any adequate assurance of immediate revisitation. Plaintiff states in a conclusory fashion that she has "implemented a new system for tracking cases I had filed and ensuring that I revisit[] each property." D.E. 42-1 ¶ 13. But the record evidence does not establish that Plaintiff will revisit the Hotel with any immediacy. To the contrary, though Plaintiff's system may let her know which properties she should revisit, she does not have a system governing a date by which she will revisit; instead, she revisits tester properties only "when [she] need[s] to." See D.E. 35-1 at 11:22-12:7, 71:7-14. As the Supreme Court has made clear, such generic statements are insufficient to support a finding of an actual or imminent injury:
'some day' intentions—without any description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day will be—do not support a finding of the 'actual or imminent' injury that our cases require.
Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (emphasis in original). Plaintiff has not demonstrated, for example, that she checks her list of [*39]  properties every month, and if she hasn't been to a property in the past month, she makes sure to revisit that property within the next week. Though Plaintiff swears that she is "confident that [she] ha[s] a reliable system in effect to ensure that I have returned, and do return, to absolutely every property I had previously sued," D.E. 42-1 ¶ 13, the Court can discern no specific methodology that would give the Court any such confidence. Cf. Kennedy v. Solano, 735 F. App'x 653, 655 (11th Cir. 2018) (holding plaintiff had no standing because she "fails to allege a definitive time to return to the Sunset Café. She avers that she intends to return to the restaurant in the future when it is ADA compliant, but these conclusory allegations contain no concrete plan regarding her return.") (emphasis added); Beachside Commercial Properties, LLC, 732 F. App'x at 821-22 (affirming dismissal for lack of standing because "[w]hile neither our court nor the Supreme Court require detailed or concrete travel plans to revisit a place to meet standing requirements, case law requires more immediacy than a "someday" plan," and Plaintiff's allegation that she "plan[s] to return to the property in the future" so that she can "shop, dine, and ... monitor its ADA conditions" was insufficient) (emphasis added). Instead, [*40]  a plaintiff must aver something akin to "a concrete a realistic plan of when [s]he [will] visit the [facility] again." Houston 733 F.3d at 1340. And that realistic plan must be imminent. See, e.g., Longhini v. Infinite 9035 LLC, No. 2:17-cv-255-FtM-29MRM, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97249, 2018 WL 2857224, at *3 (M.D. Fla. June 11, 2018) (plaintiff's stated intent to return to hotel "on or before next summer" not sufficiently definite to establish real and immediate risk of future injury). As Defendant correctly notes, the record evidence does not show that Plaintiff has such a plan to revisit the Hotel.
Thus, while being an ADA tester can weigh in favor of finding that a plaintiff has a definite intent to return to the non-compliant facility in some circumstances, Plaintiff's serial litigation history and ad hoc method of ADA testing does not indicate that Plaintiff has any kind of concrete intent or is likely to return to the Hotel and therefore does not indicate that she will suffer a real and immediate threat of future injury.
The Court pauses to recognize Plaintiff's argument that revisiting the Hotel would be a futile gesture. D.E. 42 at 9-10. In rejecting this argument, this Court agrees with the reasoning of Judge Paul G. Byron (in a similar suit involving this Plaintiff) that the futile gesture exception does not apply where, as here, Plaintiff [*41]  has not sufficiently shown she would revisit the Hotel but for the barriers to access: "as the foregoing discussion demonstrates, Plaintiff has not shown that she 'would visit the building in the imminent future but for those barriers,' which Plaintiff must show to avail herself of the 'futile gesture' exception." Kennedy v. Cape Siesta Motel, LLC, No. 6:17-cv-537-Orl-40DCI, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171725, 2018 WL 4822479, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 4, 2018).
v. Conclusion as to Threat of Future Injury
In sum, the Court has found no credible evidence regarding Plaintiff's intent to revisit the Hotel and she "cannot point to anything in the record that supports a concrete and realistic plan to" immediately revisit the Hotel. Beachside Commercial Properties, LLC, 732 F. App'x at 822. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff's "some day" assertions in her depositions and declarations are insufficient to demonstrate that Plaintiff is likely to suffer a real and immediate threat of future injury. See, e.g., Tampa Bay Americans with Disabilities v. Nancy Markoe Gallery, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53866, 2007 WL 2066379, at *2 (M.D. Fla. 2007) (finding that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a real and immediate threat of future injury despite alleging a "present intention to return to the [facility] in the immediate future, at least three or four times during the next twelve months and thereafter, and probably more often."); Hilson v. D'More Help, Inc., No. 15-CIV-60155, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50271, 2015 WL 1737688, at *6 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 16, 2015) (finding plaintiff failed to state a real and immediate threat of future injury because Plaintiff "only [*42]  declare[d] that he "intend[ed] to avail [himself] of the services offered at the facility in the future" and "intend[ed] to visit the Facility and Property within six months, or sooner."); Access for the Disabled, Inc. v. Rosof, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37853, 2005 WL 3556046, *2 (M.D. Fla. 2005) (holding that plaintiff failed to adequately plead threat of a real future injury despite alleging an intention to return to the site "annually" and in the "near future" to verify compliance with ADA because plaintiff did not allege any regular contact with the facility); Payne v. Gulfstream Goodwill Indus., Inc., No. 15-CV-81120, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141850, 2015 WL 6123529, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 19, 2015) (holding plaintiff failed to plead threat of future injury because she merely pled that she had "plans to visit the property," which the court described as "nothing more than a vague, conclusory allegation of future harm, devoid of factual enhancement."); Brother v. Rossmore Tampa Ltd. P'ship, No. 8:03CV1253T-24MAP, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28524, 2004 WL 3609350, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 19, 2004) (finding plaintiff lacked standing because his affidavit stating he intended to return to the non-compliant hotel was overly vague and illogical); Rosenkrantz v. Markopoulos, 254 F. Supp. 2d 1250, 1253 (M.D. Fla. 2003) (holding plaintiff lacked standing because he had no concrete plans other than stating that he intended to travel to the area in the next year or two); Lamb v. Charlotte Cty., 429 F. Supp. 2d 1302, 1310 (M.D. Fla. 2006) (granting summary judgment in favor of defendant and holding plaintiff had not demonstrated a real and immediate threat of future injury because he only "wished" to return to the [*43]  property once it was compliant).
To hold otherwise would be to rubber-stamp standing for injunctive relief in every case against a non-compliant property where the plaintiff self-servingly swears to a vague intention to return to the property, thereby eviscerating the Constitutional limits placed on the Court's power to decide cases and controversies. See Tiger Partner, LLC, 331 F. Supp. 2d at 1375 (explaining that the current ADA system "cries out for a legislative solution" because the current system "encourages massive litigation," which is "particularly the case in the Middle District of Florida where the same plaintiffs file hundreds of lawsuits against establishments they purportedly visit regularly. This type of shotgun litigation undermines both the spirit and purpose of the ADA.").

VI. Conclusion
Because the Court finds that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring her sole injunctive relief claim, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the action, cannot proceed to the merits, and must dismiss the action. This does not mean that the Court can grant Defendant's MSJ: "summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 is not the correct procedure for dismissing based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction because 'a grant of summary judgment [*44]  is a decision on the merits ... [but] a court must dismiss a case without ever reaching the merits if it concludes that it has no jurisdiction.'" Goodman ex rel. Goodman v. Sipos, 259 F.3d 1327, 1331 n.6 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Capitol Leasing Co. v. F.D.I.C., 999 F.2d 188, 181 (7th Cir. 1993)).
However, as standing is determined at the time of filing the complaint, and as Plaintiff has already had ample opportunity to develop her factual record, the Court finds that amendment would be futile and will dismiss the action with prejudice. See Equal Access For All, Inc. v. Hughes Resort, Inc., No. 504CV178MCR, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27230, 2005 WL 2001740, at *8 (N.D. Fla. Aug. 10, 2005) ("[V]iewing the factual allegations . . . required for establishing standing discussed above, the court finds that amendment is not possible . . . standing is assessed based on the facts as they existed at the time the lawsuit was filed . . . Nothing in the instant complaints or the plaintiffs' subsequent representations suggests that the plaintiffs can allege facts giving rise to the plausible inference that, at the time the complaints were filed . . . and based on concrete, particularized intentions to return to their establishments, [Plaintiff] was likely to suffer future discrimination by the defendants."). Accordingly, it is
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that this Action is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. It is further
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Clerk of Court SHALL administratively close this [*45]  case. All future hearings and deadlines are CANCELLED and all pending motions are DENIED AS MOOT.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at Miami, Florida, this 28th day of January, 2020.
