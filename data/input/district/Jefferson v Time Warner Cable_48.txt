CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS (IN CHAMBERS): FINAL RULINGS ON: (1) PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND (2) DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Attached hereto is the Court's ruling on the above-entitled motions. Plaintiffs' motion is DENIED. Defendants' motion is GRANTED insofar as it concerns Plaintiffs claims involving disparate treatment, hostile work environment/harassment, disparate impact, discrimination, and failure to accommodate under the ADA and ADEA; FMLA interference; and breach of fiduciary duty.
The Court would allow Plaintiff until August 20, 2012, to file and serve (1) any new documents in regards to the remaining claims in Motion 2, and (2) also to state precisely the nature and bases for his FLSA-related claims and/or retaliation under the ADEA as well as explaining [*2]  why the Court should allow him to amend his complaint at this late date. A non-appearance status conference is set for August 27, 2012.

Jefferson v. Time Warner Cable, Case No. CV-11-5637
Final Rulings on: (1) Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 12(c) or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, and (2) Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment

I. Background
On July 8, 2011, Gary B. Jefferson ("Plaintiff"), in pro per, filed this action against his employer, Time Warner Cable, LLC ("Defendant"), asserting what he characterizes (in his Complaint) as eight claims for relief arising out of his employment: 1) "Disparate Treatment/Hostile Environment," apparently on the basis of both age and disability under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), respectively; 2) "Title VII: Disparate-Impact," under the ADA and ADEA; 3) Failure to Accommodate, under the ADA; 4) Age Discrimination, under the ADEA; 5) "FMLA Non-Compliance," under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"); 6) "Torts"; 7) Breach of Contract; and 8) "Breach of Duty re Torts." This lawsuit principally concerns [*3]  Defendant's implementation of a performance-based commission/bonus plan and Defendant's failure to approve Plaintiff's request for intermittent leave beyond that leave allowed under the FMLA. Plaintiff, whom Defendant still employs, seeks $40,000,000.00 in punitive and compensatory damages. See Compl. at 12:23; Docket No. 114, at 8:10-14.
On January 17, 2012, the Court denied Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, and summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 because Plaintiff was unable to meet the necessary burdens for successful Rules 12(c), 50 and 56 motions and because the Rules 50 and 56 aspects of the motions were premature. See Docket No. 49. On March 6, 2012, Plaintiff re-filed what was, in essence, the exact same motion, though limiting it to Rules 12(c) and 56. See Docket No. 70. On March 8, 2012, Defendant moved for summary judgment or, in the alternative, partial summary judgment with respect to each of Plaintiff's claims for relief.1 See Docket No. 78. On April 19, 2012, the Court issued a tentative order denying Plaintiff's motion and granting Defendant's motion in part, denying it in part, and deferring ruling on the remainder pending the improvement of Plaintiff's Statement [*4]  of Genuine Disputes ("PSGD"). See Docket No. 99.

II. Statement of Facts
A. Undisputed and Improperly/Insufficiently Disputed Facts
Defendant has employed Plaintiff since August 1, 2006,2 when Defendant took over some operations of Comcast, Plaintiff's previous employer, in Southern California. See Plaintiff's First Supplemental Statement of Genuine Disputes ("PFSSGD")3 ¶ 1; Docket No. 102. Plaintiff is a "retention professional" working out of Defendant's Culver City call center. See id. ¶ 2. His job duties in that position include receiving incoming calls from customers, responding to customer inquiries, resolving customer complaints, retaining customers and preventing them from disconnecting their service, and selling services and cable upgrades to existing customers. See id. Regular attendance during scheduled hours is an essential function of Plaintiff's position. See id. ¶ 3.
In 2009, Defendant implemented "Scorecard," a new commission plan for its sales and retention professionals. See id. ¶ 4. Using Scorecard, Defendant awards bonuses in addition to employees' hourly wages. See id. Defendant implemented Scorecard in an effort to be more competitive [*5]  in the industry, encourage employees to perform at a higher level, reward top performers, and establish consistency between call centers.4 See id.
Scorecard measures an employee's performance using objective qualitative metrics, including the average time it takes to handle an incoming call and the percentage of customers an employee successfully retains. See id. ¶ 5. Scorecard operates on four-week cycles. See id. ¶ 6. Defendant notifies employees of the performance goals for each metric at the start of each cycle. See id. Scorecard holds all employees to the same performance goals regardless of age, seniority, or disability.5 See id. ¶ 7.
At the end of the cycle, employees are ranked in one of four tiers based on how close they came to meeting the performance goal for each metric, the fourth tier consisting of those who performed best. See id. 16. Bonuses are calculated according to the employee's performance tier for the particular cycle. See id. Employees who do not achieve a score higher than tier one may be subject to coaching or discipline.6 See id. ¶ 8.
Defendant designed Scorecard to account for time taken off for purposes such as sick leave, [*6]  FMLA leave, or vacations by setting performance goals low enough that any employee who is present for fifty percent or more of the cycle hours should achieve a score higher than a tier one. See id. ¶ 9. If an employee is absent for fifty percent or more of the cycle, then the goals do not apply and the employee will not be penalized for failing to achieve performance expectations.7 See id.; see also Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law (Docket No. 74) ¶ 9.8
Plaintiff regularly exhausted his twelve weeks of approved intermittent FMLA leave per rolling twelve-month period. See PFSSGD ¶ 15. Plaintiff first sought intermittent leave under the FMLA in December 2004, and provided then-employer Comcast with a certification from a medical provider and three one-page documents from a prior legal proceeding, one of which indicated that Plaintiff was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1993. See id. ¶ 13. On February 16, 2010, Plaintiff began reporting that some of his absences were due to a disability protected by the ADA, which Daisy LaCour ("LaCour"), Defendant's Manager of Human Resources, Risk Management, interpreted as a request for an ADA accommodation.  [*7] See id.9 LaCour attempted to engage Plaintiff in the interactive process to determine the appropriate accommodation. See id. LaCour requested that Plaintiff complete and return certain documents including an "Employee ADA Disability Accommodation Request" and an "ADA Physician Certification," but Plaintiff refused. See id. ¶¶ 15-16.
Instead, Plaintiff responded to LaCour by letter dated February 25, 2010, demanding that Defendant give him additional unrestricted intermittent leave in excess of his FMLA leave as an ADA accommodation. Plaintiff stated that the three documents in Defendant's possession,10 which he provided to Comcast in 2004 when he first filed for FMLA leave, and his January 2010 FMLA re-certification was all the proof that Defendant needed to proceed with his ADA accommodation, and he refused to provide further documentation per Defendant's request.11 See id. ¶ 16.
LaCour again attempted to engage Plaintiff by letter dated February 26, 2010, encouraging Plaintiff to submit the requested documentation regarding his medical condition so that Defendant could have a meaningful dialogue with him about whether he suffered from an ADA-qualified [*8]  disability and whether and how he could be reasonably accommodated.12 See id. ¶ 17. By letter dated March 2, 2010, Plaintiff again refused to engage in the interactive process, stating that the choice to engage in the interactive process was his alone, that there was nothing on which to interact, and that he was not going to provide any further medical documentation. See id. Plaintiff thus denied Defendant's repeated requests for medical documentation establishing that he suffered from an ADA-qualified disability, and refused to provide any documents supporting his need for additional intermittent leave beyond the twelve weeks available under the FMLA. See id.
On March 8, 2010, Gregory Drake ("Drake"), Assistant Chief Counsel-Labor for Defendant, sent Plaintiff a letter explaining that Defendant needed further information from him in order to respond to his request for additional intermittent leave as an ADA accommodation.13 See id. ¶ 18. Drake again invited Plaintiff to engage in the interactive process, but Plaintiff refused to provide any information to Defendant. See id. Plaintiff continued to request that his intermittent absences be excused under the ADA when his FMLA [*9]  leave was exhausted, despite the fact that he had not been granted an accommodation under the ADA due to his failure to complete forms, provide medical certification, and/or otherwise engage in the interactive process.14 See id. ¶ 19.
On September 3, 2010, Victoria Potlongo ("Potlongo"), Defendant's Human Resources Business Partner, met with Plaintiff, gave him a letter from LaCour dated September 2, 2010 that explained that Plaintiff's absences reported as "ADA" leave were not excused because he had not been approved for additional intermittent leave under the ADA, again invited him to engage in the interactive process, and informed him that Defendant needed information from both him and his health care provider in order to determine whether and how he could be reasonably accommodated. See id. Potlongo pointed out the ADA Physician Certification forms attached to the letter and told Jefferson that Defendant would need those completed and returned to it by September 23, 2010. See id.
In response, Plaintiff informed Potlongo that he refused to fill out any additional forms regarding his purported ADA disability, that granting him unrestricted intermittent [*10]  leave was the only accommodation he would accept, and that he would consider any further communication from Defendant regarding his request for an ADA accommodation to be harassment. See id. Plaintiff admits that the only accommodation he sought, and the only one he would accept, was as much intermittent leave as he needed beyond his FMLA leave because when he was sick, he needed to go home.15 See id. ¶ 20.
On September 4, 2010, Plaintiff sent a letter to Drake, responding to Drake's March 8, 2010 letter and LaCour's September 2, 2010 letter, in which he again asserted that Defendant already had in its possession all the information it needed to grant Plaintiff unrestricted intermittent leave under the ADA and threatened that he would consider any further attempts to engage him in the interactive process to be harassment that would cause him to file a legal action against Defendant.16 See id. ¶ 21. The information in Defendant's possession to which Plaintiff referred was the documentation he provided Comcast in 2004 when he first filed for FMLA leave. See id.
On September 13, 2010, Drake responded to Plaintiff's September 4, 2010 letter, again informing [*11]  Plaintiff that the ADA required him to engage in the interactive process to determine whether he is an individual with a disability, which is a different inquiry than whether he has a serious health condition under the FMLA, and if so, whether and how he could be reasonably accommodated.17 See id. 122. Drake reiterated that Defendant was seeking current information from Plaintiff, that Plaintiff should contact Potlongo or LaCour to engage in the interactive process, and that it was Plaintiff's choice not to engage in the process. See id. Plaintiff still refused to engage in the process and never provided any information to Defendant regarding his purported disability. See id.
Plaintiff admits that the only information ever provided to Defendant regarding his medical condition was the medical diagnosis from 1993 contained in one of the three documents he gave to Comcast in 2004 when he first applied for FMLA leave, and his subsequent FMLA re-certifications.18 See id. ¶ 23. Because of Defendant's possession of those documents, Plaintiff admits that he did not provide any additional information to Defendant in response to its requests that he engage in the interactive process [*12]  regarding his purported ADA disability.19 See id.
On March 9, 2010, Plaintiff filed a charge against Defendant with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), alleging discrimination based on age and disability taking place between August 1, 2009 and January 28, 2010.20 See id. ¶ 10; see also Potlongo Decl., Ex. 2, Docket No. 77. In the EEOC charge, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant discriminated against him by "implementing a bonus system that disadvantages older and disabled employees; denying to pay [him] for earned bonuses; [and] shifting the company's benefit system so that performance and not seniority is the dominant criterion." See id.
On June 8, 2011, Plaintiff received a verbal warning for achieving a tier one for two performance metrics during the 2011 Cycle Five Scorecard, which spanned from April 22, 2011 to May 19, 2011.21 See id. 111. Of the twenty days Plaintiff was scheduled to work during that cycle, he took four and a half days of intermittent leave under the FMLA and was absent for two additional days.22 See id. Plaintiff's tier one scores were for metrics with goals set low enough that any employee who was absent for less than ten days during the [*13]  cycle should have been able to score higher than a tier one.23 See id.
Under Defendant's policy and practice, verbal warnings fall off of an employee's record and are no longer in effect after six months.24 See id. ¶ 12. The June 8, 2011 verbal warning issued to Plaintiff has fallen off his record, no longer counts against him, and did not result in any negative repercussions or adverse employment actions.25 See id.
Another aspect of Defendant's policy and practice is that employee absences do not count as unexcused absences if they are taken as approved FMLA intermittent leave or as an approved accommodation for a disability pursuant to the ADA. See id. ¶ 14. On June 8, 2011, Defendant issued Plaintiff a verbal warning for excessive absenteeism, but did not count any of Plaintiff's FMLA-excused absences against him in doing so.26 See id. 124. This warning has fallen off Plaintiff's record, is no longer in effect, no longer counts against him, and did not result in Plaintiff suffering any negative repercussions or adverse employment actions.27 See id. ¶ 25.
B. Disputed Facts
Defendant claims that Plaintiff has always been paid the full amount of [*14]  commissions and bonuses that he earned according to the Goal Sheets. See Defendant's Supplemental Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ¶ 26 (filed after Plaintiff filed his PFSSGD). Plaintiff did not formally dispute this fact in the PFSSGD, see PFSSGD at 30, as Defendant did not include this fact in its original Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, see Docket No. 74. Plaintiff did, however, dispute this fact "in total" in his "11th Request for Judicial Notice Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201," which was, in part, a reply to Defendant's Supplemental Statement of Uncontroverted Facts. See Docket No. 114 at 7:10-14.28

III. Analysis
A. Summary Judgment Standards
Summary judgment shall be granted when a movant "shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In other words, summary judgment should be entered against a party "who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Parth v. Pomona Valley Hosp. Med. Ctr., 630 F.3d 794, 798-99 (9th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 563 U.S. 1008, 131 S. Ct. 2902, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1246 (2011).
A moving party without the ultimate burden of persuasion may carry its burden of production on summary judgment by negating an essential [*15]  element of the opposing party's claim or defense or by "showing" the opposing party does not have enough evidence of an essential element of its claim or defense to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.29 See Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000). With respect to a moving party with the ultimate burden of persuasion, "to prevail on summary judgment it must show that the evidence is so powerful that no reasonable jury would be free to disbelieve it." Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, 890 (9th Cir. 2008). "[If] the party moving for summary judgment meets its initial burden of identifying for the court the portions of the materials on file that it believes demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party may not rely on the mere allegations in the pleadings in order to preclude summary judgment[, but instead] must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987) (citing, among other cases, Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)); see also Estate of Tucker v. Interscope Records, Inc., 515 F.3d 1019, 1033 n. 14 (9th Cir. 2008). "Summary judgment may be resisted and must be denied on no other grounds than that the movant has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating the absence of triable issues." Henry v. Gill Indus., Inc., 983 F.2d 943, 950 (9th Cir. 1993); see also Marshall v. Gates, 44 F.3d 722, 725 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that a ruling granting summary judgment where movant had not met its [*16]  burden and opponent had merely filed its opposition late would effectively serve as sanction for late filing in contravention of Henry).
When parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, the court must consider the evidence submitted in support of both motions before ruling on either motion. See Fair Hous. Council of Riverside Cnty., Inc. v. Riverside Two, 249 F.3d 1132, 1136 (9th Cir. 2001). All evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Hrdlicka v. Reniff, 631 F.3d 1044 (9th Cir. 2011). Thus, "justifiable" inferences are drawn in the non-moving party's favor. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Narayan v. EGL, Inc., 616 F.3d 895, 899 (9th Cir. 2010). The court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence at this stage. See T.W. Elec., 809 F.2d at 630-31. Allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint and arguments in his Opposition brief (at least where they do not consist of "admissible" factual statements made under penalty of perjury) do not constitute "evidence" for purposes of contesting summary judgment. See Barcamerica Int'l USA Trust v. Tyfleld Importers, Inc., 289 F.3d 589, 593 n.4 (9th Cir. 2002); Flaherty v. Warehousemen, Garage & Serv. Station Emps.' Local Union No. 334, 574 F.2d 484, 486 n.2 (9th Cir. 1978).
B. Motion 1 - Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
The Court denies Plaintiff's motion. Virtually nothing has changed about his "argument" since the time he originally filed a near-identical motion, leading to the Court's January 17, 2012 ruling. See Docket No. 49. He still [*17]  cannot satisfy the necessary standard to prevail, as a plaintiff, on a Rule 12(c) motion. See Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., Inc., 896 F.2d 1542, 1550 (9th Cir. 1989). Although there has now been some discovery conducted in this case such that a summary judgment motion could be warranted, at a minimum, Plaintiff cannot prevail on such a motion because he has not complied with the necessary procedural requirements. See CD. Cal. L.R. 56-1. Proper litigants must follow the same rules of procedure that govern other litigants. See Am. Ass'n of Naturopathic Physicians v. Hayhurst, 227 F.3d 1104, 1107-08 (9th Cir. 2000); King v. Atiyeh, 814 F.2d 565, 567 (9th Cir. 1987); see also CD. Cal. L.R. 83-2.10.3 ("Any person appearing pro se will be required to comply with these Local Rules, and with the F. R Civ. P....").
Even looking past that failure, Defendant's own motion demonstrates that, as to Plaintiff's claims for relief, in most instances - if not all - there are no triable issues but the undisputed evidence is in Defendant's favor. Plaintiff would not be able to meet the applicable summary judgment standard as a result. See Shakur, 514 F.3d at 890.
C. Motion 2 - Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment
Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is insufficient to rebut the latter's showing that, as to his current claims, there are no triable issues of material facts. The Court would make two initial points in that regard. First, [*18]  Plaintiff's original Opposition brief was a duplicate of his opening brief filed in connection with Motion 1. Even in that capacity, the clarity of his arguments was entirely lacking.30 As a result, it is still frequently not at all clear what Plaintiff's various arguments have to do with his numerous claims for relief, or the material facts underlying those claims. Second, the PFSSGD is still deficient, despite the fact that the Court granted Plaintiff the opportunity to reorganize and clarify his original opposition materials.31 Of the seventy-two paragraphs of facts that Plaintiff sets forth therein as being genuinely disputed, only nine provide any specific reference to supporting evidence; and each of those nine paragraphs is either irrelevant to this motion, does not raise a genuine dispute, and/or cites to evidence totally unrelated to Plaintiff's assertions. See PFSSGD ¶¶ 2, 4, 9, 10, 14, 15, 30. The remaining sixty-three paragraphs are not supported by any cited evidence, but are simply contentions or allegations; and often not ones based on fact, but rather on legal argument.
With respect to Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's original twenty-five32 purportedly [*19]  uncontroverted facts, discussed at length above, most of those facts which Plaintiff disputes are challenged by way of the general (and inadequate) statement that "Plaintiff's First Supplemental Statement of Genuine Disputes points out the illegitimacies of Time Warner Cable's [intent/performance goals/policy, practice and verbal warnings/Scorecard] as stated herein and premised upon the facts and evidence submitted, the case history cited, including Charlene J. Roby v. McKesson Corporation et al, 146 Cal. App. 4th 63, 53 Cal. Rptr. 3d 558, 2009 WL 4232480 (Cal. Supreme)." Plaintiff also, again, attempts to cite to documents not submitted under the penalty of perjury, including "Exhibit C ADA Fact Log" (located in Docket No. 85), a five-page list of contentions and medical conditions/evaluations, occasionally supported by way of reference to exhibits to Plaintiff's Complaint, which the Court explicitly indicated it could not consider. See April 19, 2012 Tentative Ruling, Docket No. 99. Plaintiff thus still persists in improperly responding to Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law, and wholly fails to provide specific reference by specific citation (i.e., to the particular document, page and/or line number) to the evidence supporting any facts proffered by Defendant that [*20]  Plaintiff disputes, or any facts Plaintiff proffers that he believes reflect a dispute. See T.W. Elec., 809 F.2d at 630-31. In addition, where Plaintiff disputes one of Defendant's compilation of facts, he fails to identify what part or parts of that fact or facts he actually disputes and the reason for his challenge.
Plaintiff's failure to take these minimal steps weighs heavily on the Court's ability to resolve Defendant's motion. In addition to taking an enormous amount of time away from other litigants, "[r]equiring the district court to search the entire record for a genuine issue of fact, even though the adverse party does not set it out in the opposition papers, is ... profoundly unfair to the movant [as well as other litigants and the court system itself]." Carmen v. San Francisco UnifiedSch. Dist, 237 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 2001) ("The district court need not examine the entire file for evidence establishing a genuine issue of fact, where the evidence is not set forth in the opposing papers with adequate references so that it could conveniently be found.").33 Plaintiff simply has not responded to several of Defendant's arguments, as none of the "citations" or "argument" in Plaintiff's Opposition brief or his supporting material relate thereto, and has, again, failed to direct [*21]  the Court to any admissible evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on almost all, if not all, of his claims for relief. While Jones requires the Court to "consider as evidence in [a pro se plaintiff's] opposition to summary judgment all of [the plaintiff's admissible] contentions offered in motions and pleadings [signed under the penalty of perjury]," the Court may not consider purported "facts" unsupported by admissible evidence. 393 F.3d at 922-23. As a result, the Court continues on to analyze and resolve each claim as follows.
1. "Disparate Treatment/Hostile Environment" apparently on the basis of both age and disability under the ADEA and the ADA
(a) Administrative Exhaustion Requirement
An administrative exhaustion requirement applies to all of Plaintiff's ADA and ADEA discrimination claims. See Stiefel v. Bechtel Corp., 624 F.3d 1240, 1243-44 (9th Cir. 2010) (indicating application of EEOC exhaustion requirements to ADA claim); Whitman v. Mineta, 541 F.3d 929, 932-33 (9th Cir. 2008) (same as to ADEA); Josephs v. Pac. Bell, 443 F.3d 1050, 1061 (9th Cir. 2006) (ADA). The exhaustion requirement must be satisfied in order to establish federal subject matter jurisdiction. See E.E.O.C. v. Farmer Bros. Co., 31 F.3d 891, 899 (9th Cir. 1994). Events occurring after an administrative charge is filed may be considered exhausted if they are "like or reasonably related to" the events charged. See Freeman v. Oakland Unified Sch. Dist, 291 F.3d 632, 639 (9th Cir. 2002) ("While it is [*22]  true that the continuing violation theory 'draws within the ambit of a Title VII claim all conduct occurring before and after the filing of an EEO charge,' that conduct must still be like or reasonably related to the events charged."); see also Vasquez v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 645 (9th Cir. 2003) (reasoning that exhaustion could not have occurred as to events occurring after EEOC charge filed that were different from events covered by charge); Couveau v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 218 F.3d 1078,1082 (9th Cir. 2000); Chin, Cathcart, et al., California Practice Guide: Employment Litigation (2010) §§ 16:197-203, at 16-31 - 32.
In the Ninth Circuit, administrative charges are construed "with utmost liberality." B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dept, 276 F.3d 1091, 1100 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Sosa v. Hiraoka, 920 F.2d 1451, 1458 (9th Cir. 1990). Claims are considered "like or reasonably related to" an EEOC charge if the claim falls "within the scope of the EEOC's actual investigation or [within the scope of] an EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination." E.E.O.C. v. Farmer Bros. Co., 31 F.3d at 899. In determining whether a plaintiff has exhausted claims that were not specified in an administrative charge, it is crucial that there is a factual relationship between the two, and "it is appropriate to consider such factors as the alleged basis of the discrimination, dates of discriminatory acts specified within the charge, perpetrators [*23]  of discrimination named in the charge, ... any locations at which discrimination is alleged to have occurred," and whether the claims are "consistent with the plaintiff's original theory of the case." B.K.B., 276 F.3d at 1100.
Defendant in moving for summary judgment argues that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his ADA and ADEA claims because Plaintiff's averments in his EEOC complaint: (1) failed to contain sufficient detail34, and (2) the specific allegations in his Complaint filed in this action (such as his having received verbal warnings based upon the new Scorecard metrics) were not in fact raised in the EEOC complaint nor sufficient alike or reasonably related. For example, Defendant argues that the two temporary verbal warnings Plaintiff received cannot support any claim requiring administrative exhaustion because those warnings were issued after Plaintiff had already filed his charge with the EEOC. Plaintiff does not respond to this argument. Plaintiff's EEOC charge alleged that Defendant discriminated against him by "implementing a bonus system that disadvantages older and disabled employees; denying [paying him] for earned bonuses; [and] shifting the Company's benefit [*24]  system so that performance and not seniority is the dominant criterion." PFSSGD ¶ 10; see also Potlongo Decl. ¶ 9 & Exh. 2 (Docket Nos. 77, 77-4). Over a year after he filed his EEOC charge, Plaintiff received two verbal warnings: one for not meeting performance expectations for the time period between April 22, 2011 and May 19, 2011, and one for excessive absenteeism. See PFSSGD ¶¶ 11, 24. Clearly, the latter of those two verbal warnings is not "like or reasonably related to" the claim presented in his EEOC charge, which concerned changes to Defendant's bonus/benefit system and the failure to pay Plaintiff his earned bonuses. Similarly, to the extent Plaintiff would attempt to rely upon Defendant's alleged failure to accommodate his alleged disability or his assertion that he "lost his premium shift [8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday,] without notification to a 'younger' employee", see PFSSGD at 2:27-28, that conduct also would not be "like or reasonably related to" the conduct covered by his EEOC charge.
Plaintiff has not presented any analogous authority demonstrating that even the verbal warning relating to his performance should be considered "like or reasonably related [*25]  to" the conduct covered by his EEOC charge. The EEOC charge concerned Defendant's decision to implement the changes to its bonus/benefit system and failing to pay him for earned bonuses. The verbal warning concerned Plaintiff's failure to live up to the performance expectations under the bonus system and, again, was issued over a year after Plaintiff filed his EEOC charge.
On the other hand, a claim based in part on Plaintiff's failure to meet performance goals can reasonably be expected to grow out of Plaintiff's charge that Defendant's bonus system disadvantaged older and disabled employees (such as Plaintiff). Construing Plaintiff's EEOC charge liberally, the Court would conclude that an investigation focused on whether the bonus system disadvantaged certain employees would inevitably involve some fact-finding relating to employees' ability to meet performance goals and thereby earn bonuses.
In sum, with respect to their use as support for a disparate treatment claim, Plaintiff has not administratively exhausted the verbal warning issued for absenteeism, Defendant's alleged failure to accommodate, or Plaintiff's change of shift, but he may have exhausted the warning issued for failure [*26]  to meet performance goals. However, even if the Court determined that he has exhausted the verbal warning for failure to meet performance goals, any attempt to use it as evidence of an adverse employment action — as necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case under the ADA or ADEA — would fail, as addressed further below. Each claim for disparate treatment asserted under the ADA or ADEA presents Plaintiff with insurmountable hurdles with respect to satisfying his burden of establishing the prima facie case and surviving Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
(b) Disparate Treatment
Under the ADA, an employer may not discriminate "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). It is well-established that disability-based disparate treatment claims are guided by the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell—Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), which first requires that a plaintiff establish a prima facie case of discrimination.
A prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA establishes that the plaintiff 1) is disabled, 2) is qualified for the position held, and 3) suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability. See Snead v. Metropolitan Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1087 (9th Cir. 2001). An individual is disabled within the meaning of the ADA if he [*27]  has "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities [or bodily functions]," "a record of such an impairment," or is "regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). An individual is qualified if he "satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position ... and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2. In the context of disparate treatment, an adverse employment action is one that affects an employee's "compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).
The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly emphasized that "[t]he requisite degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case [of discrimination] on summary judgment is minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence." Coghlan v. Am. Seafoods Co. LLC, 413 F.3d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994)); see also Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal, Inc., 292 F.3d 654, 659-60 (9th Cir. 2002). Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. See Snead 237 F.3d at 1093-94. If the defendant is able to do so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the articulated reason [*28]  is pretextual. See id.
Under the ADEA, it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment "because of" that individual's age. 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under the ADEA, the plaintiff must show that he 1) belongs to the protected class (he is at least 40 years old), 2) was performing his job satisfactorily, 3) suffered an adverse employment action, and 4) was treated less favorably than similarly situated individuals outside of the protected class. See Cozzi v. Cnty. of Marin, 787 F. Supp. 2d 1047, 1057 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (citing Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271, 1280-81 (9th Cir. 2000)).
"[A] plaintiff bringing a disparate-treatment claim pursuant to the ADEA must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that age was the tut-for' cause of the challenged adverse employment action." Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 180, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009). The ADEA, unlike other civil rights statutes, "does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a motivating factor," id. at 174, and so "[t]he burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the action regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some evidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision," id. at 180. However, the [*29]  Ninth Circuit recently held that the burden-shifting analysis utilized in other civil rights contexts is still applicable for the purposes of a motion for summary judgment on an ADEA claim. See Shelley v. Geren, 666 F.3d 599, 607-08 (9th Cir. 2012).
Even if the verbal warning concerning Plaintiff's failure to meet the performance standards could be said to fall within his EEOC charge, Defendant has provided evidence, corroborated by Plaintiff, that warnings "fall off of an employee's record and are no longer in effect after [six] months," which is what occurred in Plaintiff's case. See PFSSGD ¶ 12; Footnotes 24-25, supra. As such, Plaintiff suffered no "negative repercussions" from the warnings. See id. Again, Plaintiff has not directed the Court to any analogous authority on the question of whether such a temporary verbal warning can be considered an "adverse employment action," but it appears that it cannot. See Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 113 F.3d 912, 919 n.3 (9th Cir. 1996) (declining to view transfer to different department as adverse employment action, citing Sixth Circuit case as holding that a temporary transfer which did not result in the loss of salary or benefits was not an adverse employment action) (citing Yates v. Avco Corp., 819 F.2d 630, 638 (6th Cir. 1987)).
Thus, because the verbal warnings Plaintiff received in June 2011 have not been [*30]  administratively exhausted, see discussion supra pp. 15-17, and/or would not constitute an adverse employment action, they may not support Plaintiff's prima facie case for his ADA or ADEA claims. Partial summary judgment is warranted in that respect as well. See Chin, Cathcart, et al., California Practice Guide: Employment Litigation (2007) § 19:741, at 19-83.
Plaintiff also claims that he "lost his premium shift [8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday,] without notification to a 'younger' employee." See PFSSGD at 2:27-28; see also Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 930 (9th Cir. 2000) (rejecting change to "unfavorable shift" as adverse employment action because action was not "final"). The Court cannot determine whether this is truly an adverse employment action because Plaintiff fails to indicate what made this shift premium or what shift he was given instead of the "premium shift." Regardless, this claim has not been administratively exhausted. See discussion supra at p. 16. Whether or not Plaintiff had some other "adverse employment action" in mind in connection with his claims under the ADA and ADEA is still unclear given the state of his Opposition papers. See, e.g., PFSSGD at 7:22-27, 8:9-10, 15-16; PFSSGD ¶¶ 24-25 (pointing out the "harm of Time Warner Cable's [*31]  no fault absenteeism policy"); Exh. C — ADA Fact Sheet, at 4:14-23. Given the fact that the Court gave Plaintiff an extra opportunity to clarify this issue (among others), his failure to do so does not save him from a ruling favorable to Defendant here. Although there may have been other grounds for concluding Plaintiff's discrimination claims fail even if Plaintiff had presented some other "adverse employment action" for the Court to consider, the Court concludes that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's disparate treatment claims because Plaintiff failed to establish that he suffered an adverse employment action.
(c) Harassment/Hostile Work Environment
The Ninth Circuit does not recognize a disability-based harassment or hostile work environment harassment claim under the ADA. See Kilgore v. Tulare Cnty., No. 10-0031, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18276, at *22-26 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2012); see also Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1190 (9th Cir. 2003) ("Our court has not yet held that such a claim exists, let alone what its source in the statute might be. We decline to do so here ...."). If the Ninth Circuit were to recognize such a claim, Plaintiff would at a minimum need to establish that 1) he belongs to the protected group; 2) he suffered unwelcome harassment; 3) the harassment complained of was based on his disability; [*32]  4) the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment; 5) the Defendant knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt, remedial action; and 6) the harassment was "sufficiently pervasive or severe to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment." See Kilgore, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18276 at *23 (citing Flowers v. S. Reg'l Physician Servs., Inc. 247 F.3d 229, 235-36 (5th Cir. 2001)). An employer's ADA accommodation efforts do not constitute disability-based harassment, as an employer "may require reasonable evidence of a disability before providing accommodations." See id. (quoting Vinson v. Thomas, 288 F.3d 1145, 1153 (9th Cir. 2002)). If it may require reasonable evidence of a "disability," it obviously may require an employee to participate in the reasonable accommodation-directed interactive process.
The Ninth Circuit has recognized age-based hostile work environment claims asserted under the ADEA. See Sischo—Nownejad v. Merced Cmty. Coll. Dist., 934 F.2d 1104, 1109 (9th Cir. 1991), abrogated on other grounds by statute as stated in Dominguez—Curry v. Nevada Trans. Dep't, 424 F.3d 1027, 1041 (9th Cir. 2005). To establish a prima facie case for hostile work environment under the ADEA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that 1) he was subjected to verbal or physical harassment because of his age, 2) this conduct was unwelcome, and 3) this conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and [*33]  to create an abusive working environment that was both objectively and subjectively offensive. See Freitag v. Ayers, 468 F.3d 528, 539 (9th Cir. 2006); Hardage v. CBS Broad, Inc., 427 F.3d 1177, 1187 (9th Cir. 2005). In determining whether an environment was sufficiently hostile or abusive, courts should consider factors "including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, ... and whether it unreasonably interfered with an employee's work performance." Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 787-88, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff's only stated basis for a harassment/hostile work environment claim is the "harassment" he alleged in connection with Defendant's communications regarding his request for an ADA accommodation. See PFSSGD ¶¶ 19, 21. No such claim is recognized in the Ninth Circuit and, as such, even if the Ninth Circuit were to adopt, for instance, the Fifth Circuit's approach in Flowers, Defendant's attempts to engage Plaintiff in the interactive process would not constitute disability-based harassment.
Plaintiff also attempts to base a harassment or hostile work environment claim on Scorecard itself, which Plaintiff states "result[s] in a loss of pay, financial instability and unwarranted discipline (harassment)." Id. at 3:11-12. First, as discussed [*34]  above, Plaintiff has not administratively exhausted either of the verbal warnings he received, which appear to be the only instances of "discipline" alleged, and so they could not be considered in any potential harassment claim. Second, Plaintiff only presents facts suggesting disability-based harassment, see, e.g., id. at 3:3, 28; 4:26 ("The disabled is the only group at Time Warner Cable subjected to these indignities..."), for which the Ninth Circuit has not recognized a claim. Even if it were to do so, or if Plaintiff had stated facts connecting the alleged harassment to his age, the harassment is only based on Plaintiff's failure to receive certain performance-based bonuses under Scorecard, and thus unquestionably falls short of creating an abusive working environment. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's hostile work environment or harassment claims alleged under the ADA or ADEA.
2. "Title VII: Disparate-Impact," under the ADA and ADEA
"To state a prima facie case [of ADEA-prohibited age discrimination] under a disparate impact theory, a plaintiff must demonstrate '(1) the occurrence of certain outwardly neutral employment practices, and (2) a significantly [*35]  adverse or disproportionate impact on persons of a particular [age] produced by the employer's facially neutral acts or practices.'" Katz v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 229 F.3d 831, 835 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Palmer v. United States, 794 F.2d 534, 538 (9th Cir. 1986)); see also Rose v. Wells Fargo & Co., 902 F.2d 1417, 1424 (9th Cir. 1990); Chin, Cathcart, et al., California Practice Guide: Employment Litigation (2010) § 9:784, at 9-75 (noting that disparate impact claims are available under ADA). Usually the plaintiff demonstrates disparate impact by way of statistical evidence, which is absent here. See Stout v. Potter, 276 F.3d 1118, 1121-22 (9th Cir. 2002); Katz, 229 F.3d at 836 ("[W]e hold that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate causation, which requires substantial statistical evidence sufficient to raise an inference that the disparate impact fell upon employees of a protected age group."); Garcia v. Spun Steak Co., 998 F.2d 1480, 1486 (9th Cir. 1993); Rose, 902 F.2d at 1424 (requiring plaintiff, in order to establish prima facie case of disparate impact under ADEA, to "'offer statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or promotions because of their membership in a protected group'") (quoting Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 994, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827 (1988)); Chin, Cathcart, California Practice Guide: Employment Litigation (2010) § 7:545, at 7-94 - 95; cf. Pfaff v. U.S. Dep't of Housing & Urban Dev., 88 F.3d 739, 746 (9th Cir. 1996) (indicating that to establish prima facie case of discrimination without intent in Fair Housing Act case, the charging party must "prove the discriminatory [*36]  impact at issue; raising an inference of discriminatory impact is insufficient") (emphasis added).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff must present adequate statistics to make out a disparate impact claim and correctly observes that Plaintiff has proffered no statistical evidence in support of his disparate impact theory of age or disability discrimination under the ADA or ADEA. Nor has Plaintiff argued a basis for relying on something other than statistics to make out his claim. See Lopez v. Pac. Maritime Ass'n, 657 F.3d 762, 766-68 (9th Cir. 2011) (noting, but not resolving on the merits, argument that ADA claims would not require formal statistical showing). He simply asserts that:
[D]isabled agents will nonetheless have a minimum of two strikes to everyone else's [o]ne because the metrics are directly linked to the number of hours worked. Scorecard, although neutral on its face, nonetheless, has a disparate impact on the disabled. Termination of employment results once an employee reaches his '6th' disciplinary occurrence. ... Hence, these are ultimate adverse employment actions and a trap for one protected group — the disabled because we are incapable of meeting performance goals as a result of arbitrary metrics. . . .
PFSSGD at 4:10-22.35 As support [*37]  for that proposition, however, he points only to a copy of a "Retention Professional Goal Sheet," which compares Plaintiff's performance during the cycle with that of the average of his peers.36 This is not sufficient to support a disparate impact claim. See, e.g., Garcia, 998 F.2d at 1486 ("The plaintiff may not merely assert that the policy has harmed members of the group to which he or she belongs. Instead, the plaintiff must prove the existence of adverse effects of the policy, must prove that the impact of the policy is on terms, conditions, or privileges of employment of the protected class, must prove that the adverse effects are significant, and must prove that the employee population in general is not affected by the policy to the same degree."). For one thing, there is no apparent reason to believe that only disabled employees, or even disabled employees as a group, would necessarily have a difficult time working under an hours-based bonus system which has been modified to accommodate the number of hours actually spent by the employee on the job during the relevant period. Defendant is therefore entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's disparate impact claims.
3. Failure to Accommodate, [*38]  under the ADA
(a) Administrative Exhaustion Requirement
Like other ADA claims, failure to accommodate claims are subject to administrative exhaustion. See, e.g., Sydnor v. Fairfax Cnty., 681 F.3d 591, 594-95 (4th Cir. 2012). However, they are not necessarily "like or reasonably related to" discriminatory treatment claims, and "one cannot expect a failure to accommodate claim to develop from an investigation into [discriminatory treatment]." Green v. Nat'l Steel Corp., 197 F.3d 894, 898 (7th Cir. 1999). In other words, an EEOC charge administratively exhausts a failure to accommodate claim only if it specifically includes a failure to accommodate argument. See id.
Plaintiff's EEOC charge did not allege failure to accommodate, see PFSSGD ¶ 10, and therefore it was not administratively exhausted. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on this claim for that reason alone. See Green, 197 F.3d at 898.
(b) Participation in the Interactive Process
Employers covered by the ADA must grant "reasonable accommodations to an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). When such an individual requests an accommodation, an employer must "engage in an interactive process with [him] to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation." Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002). This process must involve "1) direct communication between the employer and employee to explore [*39]  in good faith possible accommodations; 2) consideration of the employee's request, and 3) offering an accommodation that is reasonable and effective." EEOC v. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, 620 F.3d 1103, 1110 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Zivkovic, 302 F.3d at 1089) (internal quotation marks omitted).
An employee's "failure to provide medical information necessary to the interactive process precludes her from claiming that the employer violated the ADA by failing to provide reasonable accommodation." Templeton v. Neodata Servs., Inc., 162 F.3d 617, 619 (10th Cir. 1998). "An employer cannot be expected to propose reasonable accommodation absent critical information on the employee's medical condition and the limitations it imposes." Id.
As in Templeton, Plaintiff's repeated refusal to engage in the interactive process, see PFSSGD ¶¶ 16-19, 21-23, precludes him from claiming that Defendant violated the ADA by failing to provide reasonable accommodation.37 The documentation required for FMLA certification varies significantly from the documentation required for an accommodation under the ADA. See supra Footnotes 11, 13; see also 29 C.F.R. § 825.702(a).
The inquiry necessary to determine whether and how Plaintiff could be reasonably accommodated requires Defendant to consider far more evidence than presented in a FMLA certification. For instance, Exhibits B, C, and D, which Plaintiff [*40]  assert provide sufficient evidence to support his request for an ADA accommodation, only indicate Plaintiff's diagnosis — and even then only for a time period considerably in the past. See supra Footnote 10. The Court questions whether that information was even sufficient to support the conclusion that Plaintiff was or is "disabled" within the meaning of the ADA.
The EEOC has noted that "[t]he determination of whether an individual has a disability is not necessarily based on the name or diagnosis of the impairment the person has, but rather on the effect of that impairment on the life of the individual. Some impairments may be disabling for particular individuals but not for others, depending on the stage of the disease or disorder, the presence of other impairments that combine to make the impairment disabling or any number of other factors." Conroy v. New York State Dept. of Corr. Servs., 333 F.3d 88, 99 (2d Cir. 2003). In addition, Plaintiff's FMLA certification only demonstrated that he had suffered from a condition in the past, which "commands no per se conclusion that he is presently disabled within the meaning of the ADA." Spades v. City of Walnut Ridge, Ark., 186 F.3d 897, 899 (8th Cir. 1999).
Here, putting aside the question of whether Plaintiff was/is "disabled" (which Defendant advanced as a reason for summary judgment [*41]  here, but which the Court cannot resolve as a matter of law) within the meaning of the ADA, in connection with a reasonable accommodation request an employee must provide his employer with information concerning how any disability affects him, such that the two parties can engage in a meaningful discussion designed to arrive at a reasonable accommodation, if one is possible. Although Defendant specifically requested "current" documentation, Plaintiff repeatedly denied its requests. See PSSGD ¶ 22. Because Plaintiff's refusal to provide such evidence was the reason that the interactive process failed, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claims.
4. "FMLA Non-Compliance"
An employer may not "interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or attempt to exercise, any right provided" by the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). To establish a prima facie case for FMLA interference, a plaintiff must establish 1) that he gave notice of his intention to take leave and 2) that his employer interfered with the benefits to which he was entitled. See Farrell v. Tri-County Metro. Transp. Dist., No. Civ. 04-296HA, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50166, 2005 WL 1307695 at *6 (D. Or. 2005); Sommer v. Vanguard Group, 461 F.3d 397, 399 (3rd Cir. 2006). Unlawful FMLA interference also includes "discouraging an employee [*42]  from using [FMLA] leave." 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(b); see also Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1134 (9th Cir. 2003) ("The statute and the accompanying regulations protect an employee from any employer actions that discourage or interfere with the right to take FMLA leave."); id. ("DOL regulations clearly state that an employer interferes with an employee's rights under FMLA by 'refusing to authorize FMLA leave' and 'discouraging an employee from using such leave.'").
Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant allowed him to "exhaust his twelve weeks of approved intermittent FMLA leave per rolling twelve-month period." PFSSGD ¶ 15. Rather, Plaintiff claims that Defendant interfered with his use of FMLA leave by penalizing disabled agents for their use of FMLA leave by incorporating protected time off into its Scorecard metric system. See id. ¶ 14. However, Defendant notes that it is lawful under the FMLA for an employer to deny a performance-based bonus to an employee who takes leave and fails to achieve a performance goal, as long as it treats those employees the same as other employees on paid or unpaid leave. See Sommer, 461 F.3d at 400-01. Plaintiff does not provide any factual evidence disputing Defendant's statement that performance goals do not vary according to age or disability. [*43]  See PFSSGD ¶ 7. Moreover, there is no evidence that only those taking FMLA leave are penalized by virtue of their consequent failure to meet any of the "tier" requirements. As such, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for "FMLA non-compliance."
5. Breach of Contract
To establish a prima facie case of breach of contract under California law, a plaintiff must establish 1) a contract, 2) plaintiff's performance or excuse of performance, 3) defendant's breach, and 4) resulting damages. See Reichert v. General Ins., 68 Cal. 2d 822, 830, 69 Cal. Rptr. 321, 442 P.2d 377 (1968). Defendant argues that it never promised Plaintiff a certain amount of commission pay per month and that Plaintiff's failure to obtain that pay was due only to his lack of performance, not because of any breach of contract. Yet, although Defendant claims that Plaintiff has always been paid the full amount of commissions and bonuses that he earned according to the Goal Sheets, Plaintiff disputes this fact "in total."
Nevertheless, the Court indicated in its previous tentative opinion, and in the related hearing, that Plaintiff should not only reorganize PFSSGD, but also clarify his basis for disputing various facts and provide supporting evidence. See supra Footnote 4. Plaintiff [*44]  has failed to do so in connection with his breach of contract claim. Because Plaintiff is a pro per litigant, the Court would afford him one last opportunity to state his basis for a breach of contract claim, citing to supporting evidence. Plaintiff must state, with specificity, the terms of the contract, how he complied with the operative terms of the contract, the nature of the breach, and what he is owed. In doing so, Plaintiff should provide a copy of the contract, or state specifically what precise contract term Defendant breached. If the basis for the breach was a failure to pay earned wages or bonuses, Plaintiff should also state the period of time during which he earned such pay or the basis upon which he earned such bonuses. Plaintiff may provide any admissible evidence he has in this regard. As such, the Court would defer resolution on Defendant's motion as it relates to Plaintiff's breach of contract claim.
6. "Torts" and "Breach of Duty re Torts"
(a) Breach of Fiduciary Duty
Although employers may act in a fiduciary capacity in some respects with respect to its employees (for instance, in connection with the operation of benefit plans), and vice versa (for instance, in connection [*45]  with an employee's violation of a duty of loyalty/non-competition), the "bare legal relationship" arising out of a contract for employment between an employer and an employee does not, simply because of that relationship, give rise to a fiduciary duty on the part of the employer. Michelson v. Hamada, 29 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1581, 36 Cal. Rptr. 2d 343 (1994) (citing Odorizzi v. Bloomfield Sch. Dist., 246 Cal.App.2d 123, 54 Cal. Rptr. 533 (1966)); see also People v. Threestar, 167 Cal.App.3d 747, 759, 213 Cal. Rptr. 510 (1985); Odorizzi, 246 Cal.App.2d at 129 ("Under prevailing judicial opinion no presumption of a confidential relationship arises from the bare fact that parties to a contract are employer and employee; rather, additional ties must be brought out in order to create the presumption of a confidential relationship between the two.").
The Court has found no California case (or Ninth Circuit opinion applying California law) which recognizes an employer-employee fiduciary duty in connection with the operation of commission or bonus plans or the processing of leave requests, and Plaintiff has not directed it to any (or even to any analogous situations recognizing such a duty between employer and employee). Cf. Wolf v. Superior Court (Walt Disney Pictures & Television), 107 Cal.App.4th 25, 30-31, 130 Cal. Rptr. 2d 860 (2003) (rejecting fiduciary duty where plaintiff had a "contractual right to contingent compensation which he alleged "necessarily required" him to "repose 'trust and confidence'" in the other contracting party "to account for the [*46]  revenues received"); Multiplex Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Cal. Life Ins. Co., 189 Cal.App.3d 925, 937-38, 235 Cal. Rptr. 12 (1987). Whether viewed as a failure to state a claim or a failure to raise a triable issue of fact, therefore, any fiduciary duty-based tort claim does not exist on these facts.
(b) Fraud
To establish a prima facie case for fraud, a plaintiff must establish 1) a misrepresentation, 2) knowledge of the falsity, 3) intent to defraud, 4) justifiable reliance, and 5) resulting damage. See Philipson & Simon v. Gulsvig, 154 Cal. App. 4th 347, 363, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 504 (2007). Together, California law and federal procedural rules require each element to be specifically and factually pleaded, including the "who, what, when, where, and how" of the alleged fraud, Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1106 (9th Cir. 2003), and that Plaintiff actually relied on the misrepresentation, see Ciba-Cadlo v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 125 Cal. App. 4th 513, 520-23, 23 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2004).
Plaintiff suggests that Defendant promised certain wages that it never intended to pay, but Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled or substantiated any of the elements of a fraud claim. For example, he has not specifically stated how he relied on any alleged misrepresentation. Nevertheless, the case is presently at the summary judgment stage, not the pleadings stage.
Plaintiff has asserted, under penalty of perjury, that he was not paid commissions he earned under Defendant's bonus plan and that Defendant "never expected the Sales Retention [*47]  Agents to meet the performance goals in the first place."38 See PSGD at 6:21-27; Plaintiff's Opposition Brief at 18:14-17, 24-26. At the same time, Plaintiff ignored the Court's request that he clarify his "failure to pay" assertions in connection with his breach of contract claim. However, as discussed above, the Court has given Plaintiff one last opportunity to specify the basis for his breach of contract claim, and should do the same with respect to his fraud claim. Plaintiff must state, with specificity, the who, what, when, where, and how of the alleged fraud, and he must cite to supporting evidence. Plaintiff may provide any admissible evidence he has in this regard. As such, the Court would also defer resolution on Defendant's motion as it relates to Plaintiff's fraud claim.
7. Retaliation under the ADEA and claims relating to the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA")
The ADEA also provides a cause of action for retaliation, see 29 U.S.C. § 623(d), which Plaintiff attempts to assert, see PFSSGD at 6:6-13. Plaintiff conclusorily alleges violations of the FLSA. See, e.g., PFSSGD at 7:18-20, 8:9-10. However, the Court indicated its understanding of the full scope of Plaintiff's claims in its first tentative opinion [*48]  on these motions and that understanding did not include FLSA-related claims or retaliation under the ADEA. See Docket No. 99 at 1. If Plaintiff seeks to assert these claims, he must move for leave to amend. Defendant would then have the opportunity to demonstrate why these new claims, and accordingly amendment, would be futile.

IV. Conclusion
For the aforementioned reasons, the Court denies Motion 1. It grants Motion 2 insofar as it concerns Plaintiff's claims involving disparate treatment, hostile work environment/ harassment, disparate impact, discrimination, and failure to accommodate under the ADA and ADEA; FMLA interference; and breach of fiduciary duty. The Court would defer resolution on Defendant's motion as it relates to Plaintiff's breach of contract claim and his tort-fraud/false promise claim. The Court is of the view that the proper resolution of the remaining claims and issues raised by Defendant's motion will profit from added clarity in PFSSGD. The Court recognizes that Plaintiff is a pro per litigant and will grant him one last opportunity to raise a material issue of fact to avoid summary judgment being granted and establish that viable claims remain in the particular [*49]  areas the Court has defined. As such, the Court defers resolution in that regard until Plaintiff undertakes further effort in that direction. As the Court has previously advised him, he may wish to inquire at the pro se clinic located in this courthouse to determine whether he can be assisted in that effort, if he finds it necessary.
The Court would allow Plaintiff until August 20, 2012, to file and serve (1) any new documents in regards to the remaining claims in Motion 2, and (2) also to state precisely the nature and bases for his FLSA-related claims and/or retaliation under the ADEA as well as explaining why the Court should allow him to amend his complaint at this late date. A non-appearance status conference is set for August 27, 2012.
