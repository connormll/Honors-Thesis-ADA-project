MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
Pending is Plaintiff Linda Sun's Amended Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint, filed on September 4, 2014. Plaintiff seeks to add a wholly new claim of discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, based on defendants' alleged failure to accommodate her hearing impairment. See Pl.'s Am. Mot for Leave to File Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 60]. This Title [*2]  VII action based on race and national origin discrimination has been pending since November 2012. See Second Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 20] ¶ 38 ("Plaintiff is informed and believes that she was discriminated by Defendants based on her actual or perceived race and national origin.").
The instant motion was filed after (1) the close of an extended period of discovery, (2) the filing of two amended complaints by then-appointed counsel, and (3) an unsuccessful mediation before a magistrate judge. The parties are now briefing dispositive motions. See Oct. 16, 2014 Min. Order (setting briefing schedule). For the following reasons, the motion will be denied.
When considering a plaintiff's motion for leave to amend a complaint, a trial court should "freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). But a court may deny the motion for "any apparent or declared reason," such as when amendment would cause undue delay or prejudice to the opposing party, or when the proposed amendment would be futile. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962). In addition, a court may deny the motion when the plaintiff has repeatedly failed "to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed." Id.

I. Undue Delay
"Undue delay is a valid reason to reject [*3]  a party's attempt to add a new theory of liability to a complaint." Elkins v. District of Columbia, 690 F.3d 554, 565, 402 U.S. App. D.C. 247 (D.C. Cir. 2012), citing Foman, 371 U.S. at 182. Plaintiff states that she "has proceeded in good faith to ascertain the facts carefully Defendants have produced in discovery as soon as they were made available to her by former plaintiff counsel and defense counsel following her status as a pro se litigant." Mot. at 3. But the proposed amendment belies plaintiff's suggestion of newly discovered facts since the events underlying the ADA claim allegedly occurred in March 2011 when defendant stated that nothing could be done to address plaintiff's assignment to a work space where her hearing aid "could not function." Mot. Attach. (Third Am. Compl. ¶ 9). Hence, the court finds that this claim was available to plaintiff at the time she initiated this action and when she twice amended the complaint in April and May of 2013, and plaintiff has not provided a reasonable explanation for her extraordinary delay in raising the claim.

II. Undue Prejudice
Undue prejudice sufficient to deny leave to amend can be established when, as here, an amendment "bears only a tangential relationship to the complaint or changes the character of the litigation." PCH Mut. Ins. Co. v. Cas. & Sur., Inc., 271 F.R.D. 4, 7 (D.D.C. 2010), citing Adair v. Johnson, 216 F.R.D. 183, 186 (D.D.C. 2003). Plaintiff [*4]  states that defendants "will not be prejudiced because the facts in the Amended Complaint are already well-known to the Defendants and are in their possession." Mot. at 2. But the elements (and ensuing proof) of an ADA claim based on an employer's failure to accommodate are entirely different from pleading and proving a Title VII claim. To prevail on a failure to accommodate claim, plaintiff must plead and prove that "(1) she was a qualified individual with a disability [as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)], (2) the [employer] had notice of her disability and (3) the [employer] denied her request for a reasonable accommodation." Ward v. McDonald, 762 F.3d 24, 31, 412 U.S. App. D.C. 24 (D.C. Cir. 2014), citing Stewart v. St. Elizabeths Hosp., 589 F.3d 1305, 1307-08 (D.C. Cir. 2010). A qualified individual is defined as one who can perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Hence, "[t]o state a claim for failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must [also] allege facts sufficient to show that . . . [s]he could perform the essential functions of the position with the requested reasonable accommodation." Hodges v. District of Columbia, 959 F. Supp. 2d 148, 153-54 (D.D.C. 2013) (citation omitted); see accord Bonnette v. Shinseki, 907 F. Supp. 2d 54, 77 (D.D.C. 2012) (discussing reasonable accommodation claim in context of the Rehabilitation Act applicable to federal employers).
The court finds undue prejudice applicable because the proposed [*5]  new cause of action under the ADA would refocus the litigation and force defendants to engage in additional briefing and potentially extensive discovery on a completely new claim. See Flemmings v. Howard Univ., 198 F. 3d 857, 861, 339 U.S. App. D.C. 110 (D.C. Cir. 1999) ("An underlying assumption of any reasonable accommodation claim is that the plaintiff-employee has requested an accommodation which the defendant-employer has denied."); Bonnette, 907 F. Supp. 2d at 77 ("To survive summary judgment, Bonnette must demonstrate that the VA failed to provide reasonable accommodations that would have allowed her to perform her essential employment functions, and the VA must fail to show that such accommodations would have caused an undue burden.") (citation omitted); see also Baker v. Potter, 294 F. Supp. 2d 33, 43 (D.D.C. 2003), quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1); Weigert v. Georgetown Univ, 120 F. Supp. 2d 1, 14 (D.D.C. 2000) ("The 'essential' functions of a job consist of 'fundamental duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds,' and 'do[] not include the marginal functions of the position.'").

III. Futility
A court may deny a motion to amend as futile if the proposed amendment would not survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See M.K. v. Tenet, 216 F.R.D. 133, 137 (D.D.C. 2002); Graves v. United States, 961 F. Supp. 314, 317 (D.D.C. 1997), citing 6 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1487 (2d ed. 1990). "To survive a [Rule 12(b)(6)] motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual [*6]  matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). In Iqbal, the Supreme Court reiterated the two principles underlying its decision in Twombly: "First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions." 556 U.S. at 678. And "[s]econd, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss." Id. at 679.
A claim is facially plausible when the pleaded factual content "allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. at 678. "The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Id. A pleading must offer more than "labels and conclusions" or a "formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action," id., quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, and "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id.
When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the complaint is construed liberally in plaintiff's favor, and the court should grant [*7]  plaintiff "the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged." Kowal v. MCI Commc'ns Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994). Nevertheless, the court need not accept inferences drawn by the plaintiff if those inferences are unsupported by facts alleged in the complaint, nor must the court accept plaintiff's legal conclusions. See id.; Browning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242, 352 U.S. App. D.C. 4 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
The court finds that the proffered amended complaint is unlikely to survive a motion to dismiss because plaintiff has alleged no facts establishing that she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, nor has she alleged facts in support of the third and fourth elements of a reasonable accommodation claim, i.e., that she could perform the essential functions of her job with the requested accommodation and that defendant refused her reasonable request for accommodation. Furthermore, defendants argue correctly that permitting the amendment would be futile because plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with regard to disability discrimination. See Defs.' Opp'n to Pl.s Mot. for Leave to File an Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 66] at 3-4 (noting that plaintiff did not check the box for disability in the EEOC charge and had "made no [prior] mention of her disability in any of her voluminous [*8]  complaints about the [Office of the Tenant Advocate]"). And "[b]efore bringing suit in federal court, ADA plaintiffs, like those under Title VII, must exhaust their administrative remedies by filing an EEOC charge and giving that agency a chance to act on it." Marshall v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 130 F.3d 1095, 1098, 327 U.S. App. D.C. 302 (D.C. Cir. 1997), citing 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a); Park v. Howard University, 71 F.3d 904, 907-09, 315 U.S. App. D.C. 196 (D.C. Cir. 1995).
Accordingly, it is
ORDERED that plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint is DENIED.
