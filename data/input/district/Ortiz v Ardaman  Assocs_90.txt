Opinion



ORDER
This cause is before the Court without oral argument on the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 28), Plaintiff's response (Doc. 35), and the reply thereto (Doc. 37). Upon consideration and review of the record as cited by the parties in their respective briefs, Defendants' motion is due to be granted.

I. BACKGROUND

A. Ortiz's Employment
Defendant Ardaman and Associates, Inc. ("AAI"), is a geotechnical engineering company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Defendant Tetra Tech, Inc. ("TTI"). (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 2). On May 16, 2012, AAI hired Plaintiff Jorge Ortiz as a full-time Field Technician II at its Tampa office. (Doc. 34-2, pp. 39-43). AAI subsequently transferred Ortiz to its West Palm Beach ("WPB Office"), where he worked as a full-time Senior Field Technician ("Field Tech") until his termination on February 19, 2016. (Id.).

B. Ortiz's Job Description and Workload
 [*2] As a Field Tech, Ortiz was required to perform the following duties and to possess the following physical abilities:

(Doc. 34-7).
The work performed by Ortiz and other Field Techs in the WPB office was primarily secured through competitive bids for various projects. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 4; Doc. 34-2, pp. 52-53). The bids and subsequent contracts dictated the jobs and staffing necessary for each project. (Doc. 34-2, pp. 52-53; Doc. 28-1, ¶ 4). AAI therefore had little control over the timing of the work, which often changed daily. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 4). As such, AAI assigned work to the Field Techs at the end of each day for the following day. (Id.).
During 2015 and 2016, roughly 80 percent of the Field Techs' workload consisted of performing field density and concrete testing work. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 6; Doc. 34-2, pp. 151-52). Accordingly, AAI required Field Techs to possess the physical ability necessary to perform field density and concrete testing and has never indefinitely excused a Field Tech from performing this work. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 6). A Field Tech who could not perform both field density and concrete testing would be limited to part-time or sporadic work, assuming he could perform the remaining [*3]  Field Tech responsibilities. (Id.).
The remainder of the work available for the Field Techs in 2015 and 2016 included augercasting, helical pier monitoring, vibration monitoring, vibrocompaction, vibroflotation, and breaking cylinders. (Id. ¶ 7). Augercasting and helical pier monitoring jobs were available sporadically. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 8; Doc. 34-2, pp. 156-58). Weeks or even a month could go by without the WPB office having either of these jobs. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 8; Doc. 34-2, pp. 156-58).
Jobs involving vibration monitoring, vibrocompaction/vibroflotation in developed areas, and vibroflotation approaching buildings were also sporadic—the WPB office could go weeks or even a month without having any. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 7). These jobs generally required the use of a seismograph weighing at least twenty pounds. (Id. ¶ 7; Doc. 34-2, pp. 93-94). For vibration monitoring, vibrocompaction, and vibroflotation jobs, the bid normally called for a Field Tech to perform both the monitoring and seismograph tasks. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 7; Doc. 34-2, pp. 95-97). Sometimes, a second Field Tech had to be sent to perform the seismograph tasks on these jobs due, for example, to high vibration levels recorded near an adjacent [*4]  structure, though this was uncommon. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 7; Doc. 34-2, p. 97).

C. Ortiz's Injury
On May 21, 2015, Ortiz injured his lower back while stepping out of one of AAI's trucks onto uneven ground. (Doc. 28-3, pp. 1-4; Doc. 34-2, pp. 98, 101; Doc. 34-3, pp. 14-15). Because AAI was "busy" and Ortiz was working a "two-man job," he did not immediately report his injury. (Doc. 34-2, pp. 81, 101). Instead, Ortiz continued to work up until May 27, 2015, at which point he could no longer walk. (Doc. 34-3, p. 16). Ortiz then reported his injury to Mark Zrallack, the Assistant Project Engineer for the WPB office, stating that he was suffering from a sore back. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 3; Doc. 34-2, p. 102; Doc. 34-3, pp. 1-4).
Following AAI's policy, Zrallack reported Ortiz's injury to Brett Buxbaum, AAI's Health and Safety Director. (Doc. 34-3, p. 16). On May 29, 2015, Buxbaum instructed Ortiz to contact WorkCare, Inc. ("WorkCare"), "a contracted occupational health services company that provides 24/7 telephonic access to a clinical staff of nurses and physicians, for medical evaluation and treatment." (Doc. 28-6, ¶ 3; Doc. 34-2, pp. 113-114; Doc. 34-3, p. 16). Buxbaum also told Ortiz that he would follow [*5]  up with him on June 1, 2015, and send him to a clinic if his condition did not improve. (Doc. 34-2, p. 118; Doc. 34-3, p. 16). WorkCare telephonically advised Ortiz to treat his injury with over-the-counter medication and ice packs. (Doc. 34-3, p. 16). Ortiz followed WorkCare's directions but continued to experience pain. (Id. at p. 16-17; Doc. 34-2, p. 117). Buxbaum failed to follow up with Ortiz, therefore, Ortiz called Buxbaum on June 2, 2015, and requested to receive in-person treatment and an "injection." (Doc. 34-2, pp. 118-19; Doc. 34-3, p. 17). Buxbaum refused, informing Ortiz that taking him to a clinic would affect "[AAI's] OSHA standings." (Doc. 34-2, pp. 118-19; Doc. 34-3, p. 17). Dissatisfied with Buxbaum's response, Ortiz used his private insurance to seek treatment. (Doc. 34-2, p. 130; Doc. 34-3, p. 34).

D. Ortiz's Medical Leave
On June 3, 2015, Ortiz saw a private physician who initially determined that Ortiz should miss work until June 8th, 2015, but subsequently extended the date to June 24th, 2015. (Doc. 28-3, pp. 6, 18, 24). On June 12, 2015, Donna Reubelt, AAI's Human Resource Director, provided Ortiz with paperwork for requesting medical leave. (Doc. 28-3, pp. 7-17; Doc. 28-5, [*6]  ¶ 4; Doc. 34-2, p. 133). Ortiz submitted the paperwork on June 18, 2015, and AAI thereafter placed him on medical leave. (Doc. 28-3, pp. 20-23). Later in June, after reviewing the information provided by Ortiz's private physician, Buxbaum reported Ortiz's injury to AAI's insurance company, American International Group, Inc. ("AIG"). (Doc. 28-6, ¶ 7).

E. Ortiz's Work Restrictions
On June 25, 2015, Ortiz's physician issued a release for Ortiz to return to work with restrictions of "no lifting [greater] than 20 [pounds], no forward bending," and "breaks from work every [sixty] min[utes]." (Doc. 28-3, p. 26; Doc. 34-2, pp. 149-50). With these restrictions, Ortiz could not perform field density or concrete testing. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 10; Doc. 34-2, p. 152). Zrallack, who was responsible for assigning work to Field Techs, gave Ortiz the duty of breaking concrete cylinders after determining it was the only Field Tech work available within Ortiz's work restrictions. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 10; Doc. 34-2, pp. 169-70). The cylinders generally weigh about eight pounds, the job could be performed without bending, and the lab had a chair so that Ortiz could take breaks as needed. (Id.).
Ortiz broke concrete cylinders [*7]  on June 25 and 26, 2015, but he left work early on June 26 because his back became "sore again." (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 11; Doc. 34-2, pp. 162, 165; Doc. 34-3, p. 32). According to Ortiz, breaking concrete cylinders was outside his lifting restrictions because, although the cylinders weighed eight pounds, the combined weight of the cylinders that he lifted each day exceeded twenty pounds. (Doc. 28-5, ¶ 5; Doc. 34-2, p. 160). Therefore, on June 26, 2015, Reubelt requested that Ortiz provide an updated work status from his physician addressing the frequency of the lifting he could perform. (Doc. 28-5, ¶ 5). Ortiz failed to provide the requested information. (Id.).
Instead, on June 29, 2015, Ortiz provided a physician's note releasing him to return to work on June 30 with restrictions of no lifting greater than twenty-five pounds, no overhead lifting, and ten-minute breaks for every sixty minutes worked. (Doc. 28-3, p. 29). Then, two days later, Ortiz provided a note from the same physician stating that he could only lift up to twenty pounds so long as he could take ten-minute breaks for every hour worked. (Id. at p. 30). Zrallack again determined that the only work available that fell within Ortiz's restrictions [*8]  was breaking concrete cylinders, which Ortiz had declined to perform because it "affect[ed] [his] back." (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 12; Doc. 34-2, p. 195).
With the assistance of counsel, Ortiz sought lost wages by filing a petition for workers' compensation benefits, stating that "[his] work injuries prevent him from performing his usual job duties." (Doc. 28-3, pp. 31-33; Doc. 34-2, pp. 163-64, 176, 180). That same day, Ortiz went to see a workers' compensation doctor at Concentra, who diagnosed him with "lumbar strain" and restricted him to lifting no more than twenty-five pounds. (Doc. 34-2, pp. 178-79; Doc. 28-3, pp. 34-36). For treatment, the doctor gave Ortiz prescription medication and a cold pack. (Doc. 28-3, p. 35; Doc. 34-2, p. 181).
A few days later, Ortiz had a follow-up appointment with the Concentra physician and "begged" the physician to release him for full-duty work due to his "economic[] situation." (Doc. 34-2, pp. 182, 184). As such, the physician released Ortiz for work on July 6, 2015, with no restrictions and drafted a report memorializing the release. (Doc. 28-3, pp. 29, 38; Doc. 34-2, p. 183). Based on Concentra's report, AIG issued a Notice of Denial, partially denying Ortiz's [*9]  indemnity (lost wage) benefits claim due to "a lack of medical evidence by an authorized physician." (Id. at pp. 40-43). AIG reimbursed Ortiz for his out-of-pocket medical expenses. (Doc. 34-2, p. 164).
On July 30, 2015, Ortiz aggravated his back performing full-duty work and returned to Concentra, where a physician placed him on a thirty-five-pound lifting restriction. (Doc. 34-2, pp. 203, 206-207). However, Concentra's transcription, which AAI received from AIG, stated that Ortiz could only lift twenty-five pounds. (Doc. 28-3, p. 48). Reubelt addressed this discrepancy with AIG, who informed her that the twenty-five-pound restriction should be followed. (Doc. 28-5, ¶ 7). According to Zrallack, there were no jobs that could be performed by an employee subject to either weight restriction. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 15).
On August 13, 2015, Zrallack, Reubelt, Senior V.P. of Operations Ernie Cox, and Assistant Branch Manager Andrew Nixon attempted to speak with Ortiz to discuss light-work duty falling within his restrictions. Ortiz refused to meet with them without his workers' compensation attorney present, and therefore, the meeting did not happen. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 16; Doc. 28-4, pp. 2-3; Doc. 28-7, ¶ 5; Doc. 34-2, [*10]  pp. 215-16).
After the failed meeting, Nixon sent Ortiz an email on August 17, 2015, informing him that AAI would offer assignments falling within his restrictions as they became available. (Doc. 28-4, p. 2). Nixon also offered Ortiz the job of "breaking concrete cylinders weighing [eight] [pounds]." (Id.) Ortiz responded the same day, stating that breaking cylinders was not light-duty work due to the cumulative weight that he would need to lift each day, and attached a note from Dr. Lawrence Gofrine restricting him to lifting no more than twenty pounds. (Doc. 28-4, pp. 3-6). Still, Ortiz never provided a note from his doctor indicating whether breaking cylinder fell outside of his restrictions. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 11; Doc. 34-2, pp. 221-22).
Going forward, Zrallack sent Ortiz an email at the end of each day letting him know if there was any light-duty work available for him. (Doc. 28-4, pp. 11, 13, 14; Doc. 34-2, p. 210 (offering helical pier monitoring work)). When no jobs were available, Ortiz continued medical leave and received lost wage benefits (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 17; Doc. 34-2, pp. 213-14).
On September 15, 2015, Zrallack offered Ortiz a job to help clean the concrete lab for an upcoming [*11]  DOT inspection. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 20; Doc. 34-2, p. 253). Ortiz declined to perform the job because he thought he would need to move "[fifty] pound[] buckets of dirt." (Doc. 24-2, p. 255). However, Ortiz never addressed his concerns with Zrallack before declining the job. (Id.).
That same month, AIG suspended Ortiz's compensation benefits for the period of September 11, 2015, through September 20, 2015. (Doc. 34-2, p. 234). The suspension occurred due to an issue with Dr. Gofrine, not with AAI. (Id. at pp. 237-39). Once the issue was resolved, AIG sent Ortiz a notice informing him of the reinstatement of his benefits on September 21, 2015. (Id. at pp. 239-40; Doc. 28-4, pp. 8, 27-29).
On September 20, 2015—before AIG reinstated his benefits—Ortiz sent an email to Kevin McDonald, AAI's Vice President, expressing his dissatisfaction that: (1) he had been denied work for two weeks and had not received a lost wages payment for the work period of September 11, 2015, through September 20, 2015;1 (2) Zrallack offered him "[a]uger [c]ast [i]nspection work" on September 15, 2015, but later rescinded the offer "because he thought that taking grout sample [c]ylinders . . . was not for [him]"; and (3) Zrallack offered him a job cleaning [*12]  the concrete lab rather than the auger cast inspection work. (Doc. 28-4, p. 9; Doc. 34-2, pp. 78, 245-48, 252).
On October 2, 2015, Zrallack offered, and Ortiz accepted, a helical pier monitoring job for October 5, 6, and 7. (Doc. 28-4, p. 11; Doc. 34-2, pp. 259, 262). On October 14, 2015, Zrallack also offered Ortiz a helical pier monitoring job for October 15 (Doc. 34-2, pp. 262-63; Doc. 28-4, p. 13). On October 16, 2015, Zrallack emailed Ortiz to inquire whether he was available to conduct another "helical pier monitoring" job for October 19, which would "last approximately [three] days". (Doc. 28-4, p. 14). Ortiz responded stating that he could not take the assignment due to a workers' compensation hearing, but he could work on October 20. (Id.). Therefore, Ortiz only worked the helical pier monitoring job on October 20, 21, 22, and 23. (Doc. 34-2, pp. 270-71).
By a letter dated November 3, 2015, Reubelt informed Ortiz that his medical leave had expired, and that AAI was placing him on leave status under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") so that he could retain his benefits (Doc. 28-4, pp. 15-18; Doc. 28-5, ¶ 11). Thereafter, Ortiz took intermittent FMLA leave and continued to [*13]  receive lost wage benefits. (Doc. 28-4, pp. 30-33; Doc. 28-5, ¶ 11).
On November 18, 2015, Ortiz emailed McDonald, stating, inter alia, that he had been denied the following jobs: "[a]uger [c]ast", "[v]ibrocompaction", "[h]elical [p]ier", "[d]ynamic compaction", and "[v]ibromonitoring" jobs (the "Jobs"). (Doc. 28-4, pp. 21-22). On December 11, 2015, after consulting with Nixon, Reubelt responded to Ortiz's complaints, explaining that the Jobs he wanted did not fit within his twenty-pound lifting restrictions. (Doc. 28-4, pp. 19-20; Doc. 28-7, ¶ 7). The email stated in relevant part:
Auger Cast - This task involves the sampling of grout (concrete) which is not within your restrictions of 'no lifting over 20 pounds.'
VibroCompaction - When [v]ibrocompaction is performed in developed areas we package vibration monitoring with it; the on-site technician does both the [v]ibrocompaction and vibration monitoring. The seismograph required for vibration monitoring weighs more than 20 pounds. At the most recent [v]ibrocompaction projects (WaterClub [and] 500 Ocean), the [c]ontractor scheduled field densities for other parts of the project before or after the [v]ibrocompaction work, which means [*14]  the on-site technician also carried a density gauge. The density gauge weighs more than 20 pounds.
Helical Pier - The availability of these jobs is sporadic and you have been assigned every project that has come since we have received your restrictions of no lifting over 20 pounds. Your timesheets show that you worked on these projects: Palmsea Condo (8/18-8/21,8/28, 9/1, 9/2), Northwood (10/5-10/7), 101 Via Marina (10/15), 444 Chilean (10/20), 333 Fern (10/21-10/23). Five jobs have come in and you were assigned all five projects.
Dynamic Compaction - There was one dynamic compaction project at the FPL Plant in Lauderdale and the client required monitoring of the produced vibration levels. As with [v]ibrocompaction, the monitoring technician is also required to monitor vibrations using a seismograph. The seismograph that is used to conduct vibration monitoring weighs more than 20 pounds.
Vibromonitoring (this is the word you used in your email but it is actually called Vibration Monitoring) - The seismograph that is used to conduct vibration monitoring weighs more than 20 pounds.
(Doc. 28-4, p. 20).
On December 21, 2015, Dr. Gorfrine released Ortiz for full-duty work, thereby ending his [*15]  lost wage benefits. (Doc. 28-4, pp. 24-26; Doc. 34-2, pp. 293-96). Nixon emailed Ortiz on December 24, 2015, instructing him to report to work on December 28. (Doc. 28-4, pp. 34-35; Doc. 34-2, p. 295). Ortiz responded, stating that Dr. Gorfine's opinion was wrong and that his private physician, Dr. Thomas Roush, still had him on a light-duty restriction. (Doc. 28-4, pp. 34-35). Ortiz attached a note from Dr. Roush, restricting him to lifting no more than twenty pounds. (Id. at p. 37). In reply, Zrallack told Ortiz that AAI would adhere to Dr. Roush's recommended restrictions. (Doc. 34-2, p. 302).
On January 3, 2016, Nixon informed Ortiz that AAI did not have any light-duty jobs available for January 4, but that full-duty work was available if he wanted it. (Doc. 28-4, p. 38). Ortiz responded, stating that he could not "assume a full work schedule" due to his "physical conditions." (Id.). Zrallack sent Ortiz another email on January 5, 2016, informing him that they did not have any work available that fell within his twenty-pound lifting restriction, but reminded him that full-duty work was still available. (Id. at pp. 40-41). Ortiz responded the following day, reiterating that "[he] [could not] perform full duty [*16]  work due to [his] disability". (Id. at p. 40).

F. Ortiz's Termination
On January 21, 2016, Reubelt sent Ortiz a letter informing him that his twelve weeks of FMLA leave and entitlement to paid medical insurance was expiring on January 25. (Id. at p. 43). To determine if AAI could accommodate additional leave, Reubelt instructed Ortiz to "provide an updated note from [his] physician indicating the expected duration of [his] restrictions." (Id.). Reubelt warned Ortiz that if AAI did not receive an updated physician's note by February 5, 2016, "[it] [would] not be able to consider additional leave as an accommodation and [his] employment may be terminated." (Id.).
On February 4, 2016, Ortiz sent Reubelt an updated note from Dr. Roush changing his lifting restriction to thirty pounds, but the note did not indicate the duration of his restrictions. (Id. at p. 44-45; Doc. 34-2, p. 321). Based on Ortiz's new restriction, Zrallack offered, and Ortiz accepted, a vibration monitoring job. (Doc. 28-4, p. 46; Doc. 34-2, p. 323).
On the morning of February 18, 2019, Ortiz went into work to perform an assignment. (Doc. 34-2, p. 335). Unaware that Ortiz was in the field waiting to begin the assignment, Tim Hall, TTI's Human Resources Director, [*17]  called Ortiz to notify him that AAI was terminating his employment. (Id. at pp. 327-29, 335-36; Doc. 28-4, p. 50). Hall also informed Ortiz that he would receive a letter in the mail regarding his termination.
After the discussion with Hall, Ortiz began his assignment and reinjured his back. Thereafter, Concentra placed him on "seated-work only," and his workers' compensation claim was reopened. (Doc. 28-4, pp. 47-49; Doc. 34-2, pp. 331-35, 352). The following day, Ortiz received a letter from Hall stating, in pertinent part:
Mr. Ortiz, we understand that you are medically unable to return to work and perform the essential functions of your job at any time in the foreseeable future. There is simply no position at [AAI] that would accommodate the restrictions you are under and the intermittent duties you have been performing are not sustainable. We cannot hold your position open indefinitely and, therefore, as we discussed on the phone this morning at 9:30AM EST, we must terminate your employment with the Company. The termination of employment will be effective February 19, 2016.
(Doc. 28-4, p. 50).

G. The Instant Action
Ortiz brings suit against AAI,2 claiming that it discriminated and retaliated against him in [*18]  violation of state and federal law. (Doc. 2). In the Complaint, Ortiz alleges claims for: (1) disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. and the Florida Civil Rights Act § 760.01 (Count I); (2) workers' compensation retaliation under Florida Statute § 440.205 (Count II); and (3) interference and retaliation under the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq. (Count III). AAI now moves for summary judgment on all of Ortiz's claims. (Doc. 28).

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
A court may only "grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of "citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations . . ., admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials" to support its position that it is entitled to summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). "The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party, who must go beyond the pleadings, and present affirmative evidence to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists." Porter v. Ray, 461 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir. 2006). "The court need consider only the cited materials" when resolving a motion [*19]  for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); see also HRCC, LTD v. Hard Rock Café Int'l (USA), Inc., 703 Fed. Appx. 814, 816-17 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (holding that a district court does not err by limiting its review to the evidence cited by the parties in their summary judgment briefs).3
An issue of fact is "genuine" only if "a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). In determining whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists, the Court must read the evidence and draw all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and must resolve any reasonable doubts in the non-movant's favor. Skop v. City of Atlanta, Ga., 485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th Cir. 2007). Summary judgment should only be granted "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).

III. DISCUSSION
Discrimination and retaliation claims based on circumstantial evidence, such as Plaintiff's, are generally assessed under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 (11th Cir. 2000) (applying the framework to an FMLA retaliation claim). "Under this framework, the plaintiff first has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, which creates a rebuttable presumption that the employer acted illegally." Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1089 (11th Cir. 2004).
Where the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer [*20]  to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Id. If the employer meets this burden, "the presumption of discrimination is eliminated and the plaintiff has the opportunity to come forward with evidence . . . sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision." Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000) (quotation omitted). "If the plaintiff does not proffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether each of the defendant employer's articulated reasons is pretextual, the employer is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's claim." Id. at 1024-25.
However, "establishing the elements of the McDonnell Douglas framework is not . . . the sine qua non for a plaintiff to survive a summary judgment motion in an employment discrimination case." Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011). If, despite failing to precisely establish the McDonnell Douglas elements, the plaintiff "presents circumstantial evidence that creates a triable issue concerning the employer's discriminatory intent"—i.e., "a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the decisionmaker"—the [*21]  plaintiff can still survive summary judgment. Id.

A. ADA Claim
The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against a qualified individual because of a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) he had a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (2) he was a qualified individual; and (3) he was discriminated against because of his disability. D'Angelo v. Conagra Foods, 422 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 2005); Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). For purposes of summary judgment, AAI concedes that Ortiz is disabled, and therefore, satisfies the first prong of his prima facie case for discrimination. Thus, the Court begins its analysis with the second prong—whether Ortiz was qualified for the Field Tech position.
1. Reasonable Accomodation
"An individual is 'qualified' if []he, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions and job requirements of the position the individual holds." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365 (citation omitted). Therefore, "an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, . . . that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1229 (citations omitted).
Essential functions are the [*22]  position's fundamental job duties that an individual with a disability is required to perform. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i). In determining whether a function is essential, the "ADA provides that consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential and the employer's written description for that job." Davis, 205 F.3d at 1305 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). "The ADA regulations provide that other factors to consider are: (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function, (3) the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of past incumbents in the job, and (5) the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs." Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3) (1999)).
AAI argues that field testing, concrete testing, and lifting up to fifty pounds were essential functions of the Field Tech position. (Doc. 28, p. 15). Upon consideration of the evidence and applying it to the aforementioned factors, the Court agrees. See Davis, 205 F.3d at 1305.
According to the job description, Field Techs have several duties but roughly eighty percent of their work consists of field density and concrete testing. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 6; Doc. 34-2, pp. 151-52; Doc. [*23]  34-7, p. 2). Consequently, a Field Tech who is unable to perform both field density and concrete testing would receive only part-time or sporadic work, assuming other work was even available. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 6). Because field density and concrete testing account for such a large portion of a Field Tech's workload, AAI has required past and current Field Techs to perform field density and concrete testing. (Id.). No Field Tech has been indefinitely excused from performing this work. (Id.). Accordingly, the Court finds that field density and concrete testing are essential functions of the Field Tech position. See Davis, 205 F.3d at 1305.
Field Techs are also subject to several physical requirements, including the ability to bend, push, and lift. (Doc. 34-7, p. 2). The amount of lifting "varie[d] depending on [the] job" but Field Techs were required to lift up to fifty pounds for extended periods. (Id.). Indeed, Ortiz claims that he sometimes lifted much more than fifty pounds. (Doc. 34-2, pp. 92, 324 ("Sometimes the machine itself is almost like a hundred pounds")). Accordingly, the Court also that finds that lifting up to fifty pounds was an essential function of the Field Tech position. See Davis, 205 F.3d at 1305.
Ortiz admits, and [*24]  the evidence reveals, that his disability and resultant medical restrictions precluded him from lifting up to fifty pounds and from performing field density and concrete testing. Therefore, unless Ortiz can identify a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled him to perform these essential functions, he was not qualified for the Field Tech position as matter of law. See D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1229.
An accommodation is reasonable only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001); LaChance v. Duffy's Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1998); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii). An employee with a disability is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367. Reasonable accommodations may include: (1) additional unpaid leave; (2) job restructuring; (3) part-time or modified work schedules; or even (4) reassignment to a vacant position. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B).
Here, Ortiz does not identify any reasonable accommodation that would have allowed him to perform field density and/or concrete testing. Instead, he asserts that the ADA should have accommodated his disability by: (1) assigning him light work (i.e. non-field density testing and non-concrete testing jobs) during the periods of his restrictions; (2) "allow[ing] him to perform his job without completing [*25]  the heavy lifting"; (3) "reassign[ing] [him] to a job that did not require the heaving lifting he could no longer perform"; or (4) "offer[ing] [him] a period of unpaid leave until such time as his doctors cleared him from [his] lifting restrictions." (Doc. 28-4, pp. 21-22; Doc. 35, p. 7).
The Court finds that Ortiz's first two proposed accommodations are unreasonable. As discussed above, field-density testing, concrete testing, and lifting up to fifty pounds are essential functions of a Field Tech position. Therefore, assigning Ortiz only non-field density testing and non-concrete testing jobs, or excusing him from engaging in heavy lifting, would effectively eliminate essential functions of his Field Tech position. However, "that is not something the ADA requires." See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260 ("While it is true that the ADA may require an employer to restructure a particular job by altering or eliminating some of its marginal functions, employers are not required to transform the position into another one by eliminating functions that are essential to the nature of the job as it exists.").
Ortiz's proposed reassignment accommodation is equally unreasonable because he presents no evidence showing that he requested [*26]  another position or that a vacant position even existed for which he was qualified. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1257 (noting that the employer is not required to reassign a disabled employee if there is no vacancy); Taylor v. Pepsi-Cola Co., 196 F.3d 1106, 1111 (10th Cir. 1999) ("To survive summary judgment, [a] [p]laintiff must establish that he was qualified to perform an appropriate vacant job which he must specifically identify and show was available within the company at or about the time he requested reassignment.").
As to his final proposed accommodation, Ortiz essentially argues that AAI should have granted him unpaid leave for an indefinite period rather than terminating him. (Doc. 35, p. 7). Ortiz's argument fails for two reasons. First, there is no evidence that Ortiz requested that AAI provide him with additional unpaid leave. Second, an accommodation is only reasonable if it assists the employee in performing the essential functions of his job "presently or in the immediate future." See Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1313-14 (11th Cir. 2003). A request for an accommodation for an indefinite duration, with no indication that the employee will be able to resume performing the essential functions of his position in the "present or immediate future," is not a request for a reasonable accommodation. See id. at 1314. Therefore, [*27]  Ortiz's proposed accommodation of indefinite leave is not reasonable as a matter of law.
In a last-ditch effort to save his claim, Ortiz argues that AAI violated the ADA by failing to initiate an interactive process to determine potential accommodations before terminating him. The Court is unpersuaded. The record reveals that AAI attempted to meet with Ortiz to discuss work falling within his restrictions in August 2015, but the meeting did not occur because Ortiz refused to meet without his attorney present. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 16; Doc. 34-2, pp. 216, 219). Moreover, any infirmity in the interactive process would be inconsequential because Ortiz has failed to demonstrate that he was denied a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his position. See Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997) ("[W]here a plaintiff cannot demonstrate reasonable accommodation, the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant.").
Because Ortiz has failed to establish that he could perform the essential functions of a Field Tech with or without a reasonable accommodation, he has also failed to show that he was "otherwise qualified" for the Field Tech position. See D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1229. Accordingly, [*28]  Ortiz cannot make out a prima facie case for disability discrimination under the ADA.
2. Nondiscriminatory Justification
Even if Ortiz established a prima facie case of discrimination, his claim would still fail because AAI presents a convincing nondiscriminatory justification for terminating Ortiz. See Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1089. AAI avers that it terminated Ortiz because he was unable to perform all the essential functions of his position and he failed to provide the requested documentation from a physician indicating the anticipated duration of his restrictions. (Doc. 28, pp. 17-18; Doc. 28-8, ¶¶ 7-9; Doc. 28-4, pp. 43, 50). Thus, the burden shifts back to Ortiz to introduce "significantly probative evidence showing that the asserted reason is merely a pretext for discrimination." See Zaben v. Air Prod. & Chem. Inc., 129 F.3d 1453, 1457 (11th Cir. 1997).
To show that AAI's proffered reasons are mere pretext, Ortiz asserts that AAI treated similarly-situated employees outside of his protected class more favorably by assigning them light-duty work. (Doc. 35, pp. 12, 16-20). Ortiz identifies two employees whom he believes AAI treated more favorably: (1) a "drill helper" who smashed his fingers with a cylinder and was then assigned the duty of shredding paper (Doc. 34-2, pp. 65-66, [*29]  68-69); and (2) a senior technician—Mervan Parker4—who injured his back and was then assigned field-density work, but no concrete work. (Id. at pp. 252-53). However, neither of these employees are valid comparators.
To qualify as a valid comparator, the individuals outside the plaintiffs protected class must be "similarly situated in all relevant respects." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997). Plaintiff has not come forward with evidence showing the drill helper was similarly situated or outside of Ortiz's protected class. Furthermore, as Ortiz acknowledges, the drill helper was "fired" after he suffered an injury. (Doc. 34-2, p. 69). Mervan is likewise not a valid comparator because, although Mervan held the same position as Ortiz, Mervan had different medical restrictions and could still perform full-time work. (Doc. 28-1, ¶ 23).
Since Ortiz presents no other evidence of pretext, he fails to establish an ADA claim for disability discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework. See Jest v. Archbold Med. Ctr., Inc., No. 7:11-CV-161 HL, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17201, 2013 WL 503071, at *7 (M.D. Ga. 2013) (holding that plaintiff's discrimination claim failed because she was unable to present any evidence showing a valid comparator who was in a "nearly identical" situation and was [*30]  treated differently). Accordingly, Ortiz has failed to submit evidence establishing a colorable ADA discrimination claim.5

B. FMLA Claims
The FMLA entitles an employee "to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period" if the employee suffers from "a serious health condition" that prevents the employee from performing the functions of his position. 29 U.S.C. § 2612.29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). To preserve this right, the FMLA authorizes two types of claims: (1) interference, which occurs when the employer burdens or denies a substantive statutory right to which the employee is entitled, and (2) retaliation, which occurs when the employer discharges or otherwise discriminates against an employee for invoking rights under the FMLA. Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Cmtys., Inc., 666 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2012). Ortiz asserts both claims.
1. FMLA Interference
To prevail on an interference claim, Ortiz must demonstrate that he was entitled a FMLA benefit that he was denied. See id.; Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1206-07 (11th Cir. 2001). Further, Ortiz must demonstrate that the denial of the benefit harmed him. See Demers v. Adams Homes of Nw. Fla., Inc., 321 Fed. Appx. 847, 849 (11th Cir. 2009) (employer entitled to summary judgment on interference claim where employee "cannot articulate any harm suffered from [the] denial" of FMLA leave).
Ortiz contends that AAI interfered with his FMLA rights because it "terminated [*31]  [him] before his intermittent leave ended when [his] work activities are considered." (Doc. 35, p. 13). The Court disagrees. "When an employee takes leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, only the amount of leave actually taken may be counted toward the employee's leave entitlement." 29 C.F.R. § 825.205(b)(1). Intermittent leave is calculated by looking at the employee's "actual workweek." Id. For example:
[I]f an employee who would otherwise work [forty] hours a week takes off eight hours, the employee would use one-fifth (1/5) of a week of FMLA leave. Similarly, if a full-time employee who would otherwise work eight-hour days works four-hour days under a reduced leave schedule, the employee would use one-half ( 1/2) week of FMLA leave.
Id.
Based on the evidence on the record, Ortiz worked more than forty hours per week as a Field Tech. (Doc. 34-2, pp. 39, 43, 369). On November 1, 2015, after exhausting his medical leave, AAI placed Ortiz on FMLA status. (Doc. 28-4, p. 15; Doc. 34-16, p. 15). Ortiz then took intermittent FMLA leave from November 2, 2015 to January 25, 2016. According to the methodology set forth in Section 825.205(b)(1), AAI gave Ortiz eleven and seventh eighths (11 7/8 ths) weeks of leave6 and then removed [*32]  him from FMLA status on January 26, 2016. (Doc. 28-4, p. 43; Doc. 34-16, p. 27). Thus, AAI failed to give Ortiz twelve workweeks of FMLA leave.
Despite this technical violation, Ortiz's claim nonetheless fails because he does not allege any harm resulting from AAI's error. The undisputed evidence shows that, once Ortiz was removed from FMLA status, he took several days of unpaid leave from January 26, 2016, up until his termination on February 19, 2016. (See Doc. 34-16, pp. 27-29). Ortiz fails to point to any evidence showing that he was prejudiced by this leave not being designated FMLA leave.7 As such, AAI is entitled to summary judgment on Ortiz's FMLA interference claim. See Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89 (explaining that the FMLA "provides no relief unless the employee has been prejudiced by the violation"); Graham, 193 F.3d at 1284 (affirming summary judgment against employee who was erroneously told she did not qualify for FMLA leave but who nevertheless was given equivalent leave).
2. FMLA Retaliation
In analyzing an FMLA retaliation claim, courts employ the McDonnell Douglas framework used in Title VII and ADA cases. Martin v. Brevard Cty. Pub. Schs., 543 F.3d 1261, 1268 (11th Cir. 2008). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FMLA, a plaintiff must show that: "1) he engaged in a statutorily [*33]  protected activity, 2) suffered an adverse employment decision, and 3) the decision was causally related to the protected activity." Id.
Ortiz asserts that:
[He] engaged in protected activity in requesting FMLA leave, he suffered adverse action when he was denied tasks [AAI] had scheduled which fell within [his] medical restrictions and then terminated [him] for us[ing] FMLA leave, and there is a causal connection between these events in that he was denied necessary leave, disciplined and terminated prior to exhausting available leave.
(Doc. 35, p. 13).
In his brief, Ortiz does not specify which "tasks" AAI denied him. But presumably, he is referring to the Jobs discussed in his November 18, 2015, email. (See Doc 28-4, pp. 21-22). Regardless, Ortiz's retaliation claim fails. The evidence shows that Ortiz never requested FMLA leave. Rather, AAI voluntarily placed Ortiz on FMLA leave after he exhausted his medical leave, so that Ortiz could continue his "benefits at [AAI's] cost." (Doc. 28-4, p. 15). Ortiz did not establish a prima facie FMLA retaliation claim. See Jarjoura v. Ericsson, Inc., 266 F. Supp. 2d 519, 529 (N.D. Tex.), aff'd, 82 F. App'x 998 (5th Cir. 2003) (holding that plaintiff failed to establish prima facie retaliation claim where the plaintiff "fails to establish [*34]  that he ever requested FMLA leave").
What is more, AAI presents legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating Ortiz: he was unable to perform the essential functions of his position and he failed to provide the requested documentation from his physician indicating the duration of his restrictions. (Doc. 28, pp. 17-18; Doc. 28-4, pp. 43, 50; Doc. 28-8, ¶¶ 7-9). AAI also presents a nondiscriminatory reason for not giving Ortiz the Jobs he claims he should have been assigned: the Jobs (i) could not be accomplished by an employee subject to Ortiz's medical restrictions; and (ii) were available only sporadically. (Doc. 28, pp. 16, 17; Doc. 28-1, ¶¶ 17-18; Doc. 28-4, pp. 19-20; Doc. 28-8, ¶¶ 7-8).
As with his ADA claim, Ortiz attempts to establish pretext by arguing that similarly-situated employees outside of his class were treated more favorably than him. Ortiz seems to contend that Mervan and the drill helper were similarly situated because they suffered work-related injuries. However, Ortiz points to no specific facts or evidence showing how these employees were similarly situated to him in all relevant respects or that they were outside of his protected class. Therefore, Mervan [*35]  and the drill helper are not valid comparators. See Leigh v. Warner Bros., Inc., 212 F.3d 1210, 1217 (11th Cir. 2000) ("[C]onclusory allegations without specific supporting facts have no probative value.").
Ortiz has submitted no other evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that AAI's justification for its actions were a pretext for retaliation. Accordingly, Ortiz fails to establish a viable FMLA retaliation claim under the McDonell Douglas framework.

C. Workers' Compensation Claim
Finally, the Court turns to Ortiz's workers' compensation retaliation claim brought under Florida's Workers' Compensation Act ("FWCA"), Fla. Stat. §§ 440.01 et seq., which provides that "[n]o employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any employee by reason of such employee's valid claim for compensation . . . under the Workers' Compensation Law." Fla. Stat. § 440.205.
1. Prima Facie Case
Section 440.205 retaliation claims are also subject to the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis. Humphrey v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 192 F. Supp. 2d 1371 (S.D. Fla. 2002). To prevail on such a claim, a plaintiff must establish the following: (1) he engaged in the statutorily protected activity; (2) the plaintiff suffered adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Gonzales v. Pasco Cty. Bd. of [*36]  Cty. Comm'rs, No. 8:11-CV-1397-T-30TGW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7249, 2013 WL 179948, at *8 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 17, 2013).
Ortiz argues that AAI retaliated against him for seeking workers' compensation benefits. (Doc. 2, ¶ 30). Neither the Complaint nor Ortiz's brief outlines the adverse action AAI took against him in retaliation for using the workers' compensation system. But in its motion for summary judgment, AAI proceeds from the understanding that Ortiz's claim is premised solely on his termination. (Doc. 28, p. 23-24). In discussing his workers' compensation claim, Ortiz does not dispute this characterization. (Doc. 35, pp. 14-20). As such the Court follows the parties lead as to the basis for Ortiz's workers' compensation claim.8
AAI does not debate that Ortiz engaged in protected activity by requesting workers' compensation or that Ortiz's termination constitutes an adverse employment action. Instead, AAI argues that Ortiz cannot establish a causal connection between his request for workers' compensation and his termination. (Doc. 28, pp 23-24). In his response, Ortiz argues that several "intervening acts" occurred between his request for workers' compensation and his termination that "serve[] to bolster [his] showing of causation." (Doc. 35, p. 16). Specifically, [*37]  Ortiz argues:
Here, the sum total of the facts demonstrates causation. Plaintiff was injured on the job on May 21, 2015[,] and reported the injury when it became so painful that he could not move, on May 27, 2015. Thereafter, Defendants' agent, Buxbaum, refused Plaintiff medical treatment, demanding that the only treatment and advice he receive was via telephone with WorkCare. When Plaintiff indicated that the advice did not improve his injury and that he required a physical examination, Buxbaum refused, citing the effect the medical treatment would have on Defendants' OSHA standards. Buxbaum failed to file the forms necessary for a workers' compensation claim until Plaintiff hired legal counsel, over a month after the injury. Thereafter, although Plaintiff requested work, Plaintiff was regularly denied tasks that supervisors had scheduled which Plaintiff could have performed even with his medical restrictions. After denying Plaintiff work that he could perform, Defendants opted to fire Plaintiff rather than granting him additional time off or assignment to tasks they already had scheduled that Plaintiff could perform.
(Id. at pp. 15-16).
The Court is not convinced that these events support a reasonable [*38]  inference of causal connection between Ortiz's claim for workers' compensation and his termination. But there is still sufficient evidence in the record to establish causation. A causal connection between a plaintiff's protected activity and an employer's adverse employment action may be inferred from temporal proximity so long as the timing between the two events is "very close". Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007).
Here, close temporal proximity exists between the time that Ortiz's workers' compensation benefits ended (December 27, 2015) and his termination (February 19, 2015). (Doc. 28-4, pp. 33, 50). Therefore, an inference of causal connection can be drawn, and Ortiz makes out a prima facie case for retaliation. See Renta v. Cigna Dental Health, Inc., No. 08-60938CIV, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101491, 2009 WL 3618246, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 29, 2009) (explaining that a "close temporal proximity" is between one and two months). The burden now shifts to AAI to present nondiscriminatory for its adverse employment action.
2. Pretext
As noted supra, AAI asserts two nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating Ortiz's employment. Ortiz maintains that these reasons are pretextual because AAI treated him differently than other employees—namely, the drill helper and Mervan. (Doc. 25, pp. 16-20). But again, [*39]  he points to no evidence demonstrating that the drill helper and Mervan were similarly-situated employees outside of his protected class. Thus, Ortiz fails to rebut AAI's nondiscriminatory reason for his termination and therefore cannot establish a workers' compensation retaliation claim.
3. Mosaic Test
Perhaps realizing that his claims would not survive under a McDonnell Douglas analysis, Ortiz argues that his claim survives summary judgment under the mosaic test advanced in Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011). However, the circumstantial evidence that Ortiz presents is not comparable to the evidence presented by the plaintiff in Smith, which indicated a clear connection between the employer's actions and the employee's race. See Connor v. Bell Microproducts-Future Tech., Inc., 492 Fed. Appx. 963, 967 n.1 (11th Cir. 2012) (observing that the employee in Smith "presented evidence that his employer was particularly concerned with race and all of the circumstantial evidence connected its employees' race to the employer's decision-making"). Ortiz merely relies on the same circumstantial evidence he offered for his pretext arguments rejected above. Considering Plaintiff's submissions and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, no reasonable jury could conclude that AAI is liable for the challenged [*40]  discrimination and retaliation.9 Accordingly, AAI is entitled to summary judgment on Ortiz's workers' compensation retaliation claim.

IV. CONCLUSION
1. Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 28) is GRANTED.
2. The Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to enter judgment in favor of Defendants and to close the case.
DONE AND ORDERED in Orlando, Florida on March 27, 2019.
