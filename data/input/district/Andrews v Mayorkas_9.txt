Opinion



MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
Plaintiff Cynthia Andrews, appearing pro se, sues the Secretary of Homeland Security, claiming "reprisal and disparate treatment for requesting reasonable accommodation, failure to pay over-time, and to correct Plaintiff's records." Compl. at 1, Dkt. 1. Plaintiff alleges that "Defendant violated multiple federal statutes and regulations," but initially invokes only the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA"). Id. at 1-2. Defendant has moved for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 56, Dkt. 31, and Plaintiff has cross moved for summary judgment, Dkt. 36, 42. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Defendant's motion and deny Plaintiff's motion.

I. BACKGROUND
On February 9, 2014, Plaintiff was hired as a one-year probationary employee [*2]  in Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") Office, as a GS-9/11 Paralegal Specialist. Her primary duties entailed "[c]reating FOIA request files, reviewing the FOIA requests and documentation that went along with it, [and] making electronic redactions. Letters and other responses to requestors were reviewed by [Plaintiff's] supervisor and then sent to the requester." Aff. of Cynthia Roseberry Andrews, Dkt. 31-3 at 7.2 On May 21, 2014, while still in her one-year probation period, Plaintiff was issued a termination letter, effective immediately. The relevant events follow.

A. Requests for Accommodation
In 2010, Plaintiff was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ("ADHD-1"), which "impacts her ability to focus and concentrate." Def.'s Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts ("Def.'s Facts") ¶ 5, Dkt. 31-2. Because of her "impairment," Plaintiff "can be distracted by wires and other occupational task irrelevant stimuli, like noise." Id. ¶ 6. On February 18, 2014, one week into the job, Plaintiff discussed with her second-line supervisor, Supervisory Paralegal Specialist Fernando Pineiro (hereafter Pineiro), her need for a wireless mouse as a reasonable accommodation for [*3]  her ADHD-1. Pineiro referred Plaintiff to ICE's Office of Diversity and Civil Rights ("Civil Rights Office"), id. ¶ 13, to which Plaintiff submitted a written request for a wireless mouse on March 10, 2014, id. ¶ 18. On March 19, 2014, the Civil Rights Office requested that Plaintiff provide supporting medical documentation, which Plaintiff anticipated might be delayed because she needed to make an appointment with her doctor at the Veterans Administration, which "takes a long time[.]" Def.'s Facts ¶¶ 19-20 (quoting Dkt. 31-15 at 31 (Aug. 30, 2016 Tr.)). On April 11, 2014, after receiving one extension, Plaintiff provided the supporting documentation, and she received the wireless mouse on April 23, 2014. Id. ¶¶ 23, 39.
At an unspecified time, Plaintiff's third-line supervisor, FOIA Office Director Catrina Pavlik-Keenan (hereafter Pavlik-Keenan), and Pineiro, both of whom participated in the decision to hire Plaintiff, "decided to move several employees from the two FOIA teams so that team members could be closer to one another and their supervisors. Def.'s Facts ¶ 48. On May 2, 2014, Plaintiff's immediate supervisor, Supervisory Paralegal Specialist Ruthlee Gowins (hereafter Gowins), [*4]  notified Plaintiff about her relocation "to another cubicle and directed her to move her belongings to the new cubicle." Id. ¶ 49. Plaintiff was moved "to a desk right next to a copier, away from where we had arranged for her to sit." Aff. of Ruthlee Gowins, Dkt. 31-8 at 28. Plaintiff informed Gowins that "she could focus better where she was before the move." Id. Gowins in turn told Pineiro that "the copier was a problem for [Plaintiff]" and also sent him Plaintiff's "email saying she would prefer not to have that desk." Id. According to Gowins, during her conversation with Pineiro, he replied "'so,'" and "'You know she's going to complain', " and in response to Plaintiff's email, Pineiro "was adamant, said I could fire Complainant, get rid of her." Id. Gowins "went back to [Plaintiff] and explained that she has to move"; Plaintiff "stated she knows and started packing her things." Id.

B. EEO Activity
On April 18, 2014, Plaintiff initiated contact with an Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") Counselor. Dkt. 31-28 at 2 (Final Agency Order); Dkt. 31-23 (Compl. of Employment Discrimination). On May 28, 2014, one week after the termination notice and two weeks after Plaintiff's final interview [*5]  on the discrimination complaint, ICE notified Plaintiff that the informal EEO counseling had concluded unsatisfactorily and that she could file a formal complaint of discrimination raising "only . . . the claim(s) or matters related to those claims that were discussed during EEO counseling." Dkt. 31-29 at 2. The notice stated: "On April 18, 2014, you contacted ODCR to begin the pre-complaint process. During that contact you, alleged discrimination on the basis of disability (cognitive disorder) and subsequently included sex (female)." Id.
On June 11, 2014, Plaintiff filed a formal complaint alleging discrimination based on sex, physical or mental disability, and retaliation/reprisal between February 18, 2014, and May 21, 2014. See Dkt. 31-23 (Formal Compl.). On July 7, 2014, Plaintiff supplemented the formal complaint with a document dated June 15, 2014, listing the following bases: "Disability Harassment, Gender, Whistleblower, Retaliation," and "discuss[ing] the hostile and vulgar, work environment" that she allegedly "was forced to work in." Dkt. 31-17 at 2-4.
By notice of August 18, 2014, the Civil Rights Office acknowledged Plaintiff's formal complaint (HS-ICE-01060-2014) and provided [*6]  the following "Statement of Accepted Claim": "Whether [Plaintiff] was subjected to discrimination based on sex (female), disability (physical) and reprisal (reasonable accommodation request), constituting a hostile work environment from February 18, 2014 to May 21, 2014, which culminated in her termination." Dkt. 31-25 at 2. The notice included ten separate events—occurring on the 18th and 28th of February 2014; the 2nd, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 23rd of April 2014; and the 2nd and 21st of May 2014—that Plaintiff offered in support of her hostile work environment claim. See id. at 2-3. In addition, the notice gave Plaintiff five calendar days from receipt to "provide . . . written clarification" of any claims she believed to be incorrectly identified; otherwise, Plaintiff was presumed to "agree with the claims as defined above." Id. at 3.
On September 24, 2014, during the agency's investigation of the formal complaint, Plaintiff provided an affidavit in which she added "race as another basis." Dkt. 31-3 at 5. She described herself as "Black American, Choctaw-Cherokee Indian, Irish, Jewish, and . . . medium brown in color." Id. Plaintiff further averred that although the harassment charge [*7]  initially "related only to [her] disability and military affiliation," she "later came to understand that it was also related to [her] sex, race, and EEO activity (real and perceived)." Id. at 8 (parenthesis in original).
On December 5, 2014, ICE forwarded Plaintiff a copy of the Investigative File and notified her of the right either to request a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge ("AJ") or to receive a Final Agency Decision. See Dkt. 31-28 at 3. On January 2, 2015, Plaintiff requested a hearing, which was held on August 29 and August 30, 2016, before an AJ from the EEOC's New Orleans Field Office. Id. On September 20, 2017, the AJ issued an Order Entering Judgment in favor of the agency upon concluding that Plaintiff had "failed to sustain her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency illegally discriminated against [her] on the bases of sex, disability or in retaliation for her protected EEO activity." Dkt. 31-26 at 31.
Also, on September 20, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties ("DHS Civil Rights Office") received the AJ's decision. On October 21, 2017, that Office issued the agency's Final Order [*8]  affirming the AJ's decision. It specifically found that the factual determinations were supported by substantial evidence in the record and the relevant legal standards were correctly applied. Dkt. 31-28.

C. Plaintiff's Termination
On April 17, 2014, while Gowins was on leave, Pavlik-Keenan "asked to review the work of some of Supervisor Gowins' staff since she had not received much work from that team." Def.'s Facts ¶ 25. Upon reviewing a case Plaintiff had processed, Pavlik-Keenan "believed" that Plaintiff had processed the case incorrectly but "later learned" that she was mistaken. Id. ¶ 26. Nevertheless, acting on her belief at the time, Pavlik-Keenan offered the same day to train Plaintiff on "how to process the case," but Plaintiff refused the offer. Id. ¶ 27. On April 18, 2014, Pineiro and Supervisory Paralegal Todd Fuss (hereafter Fuss), who was not in Plaintiff's chain of command, "met with Plaintiff to counsel her on her performance and conduct (including her attitude, lack of respect, and resistance to training)." Id. ¶ 28. In a memorializing email after the meeting, Pineiro wrote, among other things, "that Plaintiff ha[d] asked for contact information for the EEO office and [*9]  human resources, and that [he] had given her the requested contact information." Id. ¶ 29.
On April 21, 2014, Pineiro emailed "David Daniel" a recommendation to terminate Plaintiff's employment and copied Gowins and Pavlik-Keenan.3 Pineiro wrote:
After careful consideration and newly found information pertaining the case of employee Cynthia Roseberry Andrews I am recommending immediate termination. Attached you will see an email for the record that I drafted last Friday morning. At the end of day Friday evening the employee still did not tum in any new completed work for review nor ask for assistance of any kind. This morning I asked to speak to the senior supervisor on duty to compare the product and deliverables of our 3 newest employees and found that in the last 60 days:
Employee A — accura[tely completed approximately 163 cases Employee B - accurately completed approximately 151 cases And the Employee in question only accurately completed 1 case as verified by a senior employee, a supervisor and myself during the same time frame.
Due to employee's unwillingness to receive constructive criticism, abrasive behavior, proven disregard of the responsibilities of her assigned position and [*10]  almost zero accurately completed work in over 60 days I recommend immediate termination.
Dkt. 31-22 at 3. On April 24, 2014, Fuss "contacted" Pineiro "to document an exchange he had with Plaintiff the week of April 4, 2014, in which she sought assistance regarding a technical problem she was having but then refused to listen to [his] attempts to explain a solution." Def.'s Facts ¶ 43.
On April 25, 2014, Gowins, in a follow-up e-mail to Pineiro concerning Plaintiff's job performance, wrote that she had reviewed Plaintiff's "two (2) cases in filemaker" and "none of the cases, since [Plaintiff] started the job, were closed properly." Dkt. 31-22 at 8; Def.'s Facts ¶ 44. Gowins proposed sitting with Plaintiff "to go over the [standard operating procedures] again from start to finish" and "to close out all the cases she processed thus far." Dkt. 31-22 at 8. Gowins reminded Pineiro about "training at DOJ, OIP in the upcoming months" that Plaintiff would be attending and further informed that she "had" Plaintiff "go in and complete all her required training in virtual university." Id. On April 28, 2014, in an email to Plaintiff, Gowins wrote: "Please go into filemaker and close out the cases [*11]  on the list we worked on last week. They will need to be closed out the same way the others were done on Friday." Dkt. 31-22 at 9. Gowins requested that Plaintiff let her know "when you are completed" since she "will need an accurate number of cases you closed for your mid-year review." Id.
On April 29, 2014, Gowins informed Pineiro, in accordance with his guidance with respect to employees who had not met "their numbers," that she had four employees, including Plaintiff, to place on a performance improvement plan (PIP). Dkt. 31-22 at 11; Def.'s Facts ¶ 45. That same day, Pineiro replied that Plaintiff should be excluded "from a PIP" and instead be provided "counseling/training in writing because she's probationary and doesn't require a PIP." Dkt. 31-22 at 10. On April 30, 2014, Gowins emailed Plaintiff about an 8 a.m. "FOIA training for new paralegals" that Fuss was conducting the next day, which "she should attend." Def.'s Facts ¶ 46. On May 2, 2014, in an email to Gowins, Fuss reported, among other things, "that Plaintiff arrived [at the training] 8-10 minutes late, without explanation, put her things down on the table[,] left again . . . [and] returned about 4 minutes after that." [*12]  Id. ¶ 47.
On May 7, 2014, in an email to Employee Labor Relations Attorney Joel T. Alexander, see Dkt. 31-26 at 30, and copied to Pineiro, Gowins sought "guidance on how to proceed with" Plaintiff who it "appears . . . does not want to follow the instructions of a Supervisor," Dkt. 31-22 at 14. Gowins outlined "three recent issues with her conduct that need to be corrected," adding that "[s]he has displayed a number of the Offenses on the ICE Table of Offenses and Penalties: E. Failure/Refusal to Follow Orders and I Neglect of Duty." Id. (underlining in original). Under each issue, Gowins described and documented the offending conduct and correlated it with several offenses best summarized as insolence, disrespect of a supervisor, and subpar job performance. See id. Under Issue 3, Gowins wrote:
I have been working closely with Cynthia to help her performance. She and others were given the opportunity to participate in a FOIA Training held by the other Supervisory Paralegal. I also reviewed the Mid-Cycle Performance Plan and SOP with her. She is aware that the GS-9 Paralegal Specialist is required to process 45 USCIS cases per week. Today she handed me one (1) USCIS case consisting of [*13]  22 pages for review . . . . It has taken her three days to work one case. At this rate she will not be able to meet the required numbers for her performance. I have attached a copy of her PWP with Mid-Cycle discussion and the email of her completing the training with the other Supervisor.
Dkt. 31-22 at 14. Gowins listed the offending conduct as "delay in carrying out orders, work assignments, instructions of superiors, policies, or procedures." Id. A handwritten notation indicated "no reply from Joel." Id.
On May 21, 2014, Pavlik-Keenan issued the termination letter to Plaintiff, explaining:
You entered on duty with the Agency on February 9, 2014. You were hired into the competitive service with the knowledge that you would be required to serve a one-year probationary period. During this time, your performance, development, conduct, and general suitability were assessed. Employment may be terminated during a probationary period due to work performance or conduct reasons.
The bases for this termination action are your performance and conduct in the workplace. Your performance work plan sets forth a goal that you must process an average of 45 U.S. Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS) [*14]  requests or 1200 pages per week in order to be at an acceptable level of performance. Since entering on duty with the Agency, you have failed to consistently meet this objective. You have been provided with instructions and training opportunities to increase your productivity; however, during the last three weeks alone, the average number of USCIS requests and pages per week that you processed were far below the acceptable level. Furthermore, you have exhibited conduct issues, which include disrespectful conduct toward your supervisors and failure to follow their instructions. For example, on May 2, 2014, your supervisor, Ruthlee Gowins, instructed you and her other subordinates to send an email when leaving and returning from lunch. Soon after that email was sent, you told Ms. Gowins that the email "was stupid and it's illegal" and you failed to consistently send the emails as instructed. These issues are not consistent with performing the office's mission or with your role as a Paralegal Specialist.
Therefore, I have determined that it is in the best interest of the Agency to terminate your employment at this time.
Dkt. 31-22 at 39).
Between May 2012 and May 2014, Plaintiff was one [*15]  of five employees (two women and three men) terminated from ICE's FOIA office. Plaintiff and two white men, one of whom was disabled, were fired during their respective probationary period. See Def.'s Fact ¶ 55.

D. Court Proceedings
In February 2018, Plaintiff filed this action seeking judicial review of the agency's decisions. See Compl. ¶ 1. In addition to the APA, Plaintiff invokes Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e "Unlawful Employment Practices," and the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. § 2302 "Prohibited Personnel Practices." Compl. ¶¶ 59-63 (Causes of Action). On June 5, 2019, the Court referred the proceedings to a Magistrate Judge for mediation, which ended unsuccessfully on August 7, 2019. On December 1, 2020, after more than one year of inactivity, the Court ordered Plaintiff to explain why the case should not be dismissed for want of prosecution. Eventually, Plaintiff stated her desire to continue prosecuting the case and briefing ensued. The parties' fully briefed motions for summary judgment are now before the court for resolution.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, "[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Waterhouse v. District of Columbia, 298 F.3d 989, 991 (D.C. Cir. 2002). The moving [*16]  party must identify "those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotations omitted). A material fact is one that is capable of affecting the outcome of the litigation. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A genuine dispute is one in which "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id.
In ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, as here, the Court shall grant summary judgment only if one of the moving parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law upon material facts that are not genuinely disputed. See Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 658 F. Supp. 2d 217, 224 (D.D.C. 2009) (Sullivan, J.). Summary judgment may be granted, therefore, if the plaintiff fails to submit evidence that creates a genuine factual dispute or entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Adair v. Solis, 742 F. Supp. 2d 40, 50 (D.D.C. 2010) (Sullivan, J.), aff'd, 473 Fed. App'x 1 (D.C. Cir. 2012).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Applicable Laws
Although Plaintiff alleges violations of "multiple" laws, "[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction," possessing "only that power authorized by Constitution and statute." Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994). It is "presumed that a cause lies outside this limited [*17]  jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction." Id. (citations omitted)). Thus, the Court, mindful of its "independent duty to assess jurisdiction," Williams v. Donovan, 219 F. Supp. 3d 167, 180 (D.D.C. 2016), will clarify the claims over which it has jurisdiction.

1. Personnel Actions
The United States and its agencies may be sued only upon consent "unequivocally expressed in statutory text." Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996) (citations omitted). It is established that "the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ["CSRA"], Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.), and related employment statutes," are exclusive avenues for federal employees seeking redress of employment disputes. Filebark v. U.S. Dep't of Transp., 555 F.3d 1009, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 2009). The D.C. Circuit explains that
the CSRA specifies the benefits to which federal employees and their survivors are entitled, and provides a reticulated remedial regime for beneficiaries to secure review—including judicial review—of benefits determinations. That regime provides for adjudication of all claims by OPM, 5 U.S.C. § 8347(b), appeal of adverse decisions by OPM to the MSPB, id. § 8347(d)(1), and subsequent review of MSPB decisions in the Federal Circuit, id. § 7703(b)(1); 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(9). A series of opinions from the Supreme Court and this court make clear that these remedial provisions are exclusive, and may not be supplemented by the recognition [*18]  of additional rights to judicial review having their sources outside the CSRA.
Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2005); see id. at 67 (citing cases that recognize "in a variety of contexts, the exclusivity of the remedial and review provisions of the CSRA"). Similarly, under the Whistleblower Protection Act ("WPA"), Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (codified as amended in scattered sections of Title 5 of the U.S. Code),
a federal employee raising whistleblower claims generally must first complain to the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"). 5 U.S.C. § 1214(a)(3); 5 C.F.R. § 1209.5(a). If the OSC either terminates its investigation of a claim or fails to notify the claimant whether it intends to seek corrective action, the claimant may then pursue an individual right of action before the MSPB. 5 U.S.C. § 1214(a)(3). A final decision of the MSPB is appealable to the Federal Circuit, 5 U.S.C. § 7703(b)(1)(A), although certain whistleblower claims may also be appealed to any court of appeals. 5 U.S.C. § 7703(b)(1)(B). In any event, "[u]nder no circumstances does the WPA grant the District Court jurisdiction to entertain a whistleblower cause of action brought directly before it in the first instance.
Gibbs v. Jewell, 36 F. Supp. 3d 162, 166-67 (D.D.C. 2014) (quoting Stella v. Mineta, 284 F.3d 135, 142 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (other citations omitted)); see Marcato v. United States Agency for Int'l Dev., 11 F.4th 781, 783 (D.C. Cir. 2021) ("The Whistleblower Protection Act [WPA] permits any federal employee subjected to a personnel practice prohibited by section 2302(b)(8) to 'seek corrective action' from the MSPB.") (citing 5 U.S.C. § 1221(a)).
To the extent that Plaintiff has brought claims premised [*19]  on personnel decisions unrelated to unlawful discrimination, such as overtime pay issues, whistleblower activity, military preferences, and performance appraisals, see Compl. at 3-4, 5-9 and Pl.'s Mem. of P. & A., Dkt. 37 at 2-3, the foregoing statutory schemes deprive this district court of jurisdiction. See Fornaro, 416 F.3d at 67 ("In sum, so far as review of determinations under the CSRA is concerned, what you get under the CSRA is what you get."); Bunce v. Computer Scis. Corp., 113 F. Supp. 3d 234, 237 (D.D.C. 2015) ("[T]he D.C. Circuit has consistently held that federal district courts lack jurisdiction over whistleblower claims brought under the WPA.") (citations omitted)).
The CSRA "preserves the rights of employees to bring suit under Title VII and other federal anti-discrimination laws, . . . and therefore [does] not preclude" Plaintiff's claims of unlawful discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment. Mahoney v. Donovan, 721 F.3d 633, 635 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Because of the comprehensiveness of the laws governing federal employment disputes, however, the D.C. Circuit has "long held that federal employees may not use the [APA] to challenge agency employment actions." Filebark, 555 F.3d at 1010 (citing Fornaro, 416 F.3d at 66-67; Graham v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 931, 933-35 (D.C. Cir. 2004); Carducci v. Regan, 714 F.2d 171, 172 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). Consequently, the Court agrees that Plaintiff has no cognizable claim under the APA, see Def.'s Mem. at 18-19, and thus grants [*20]  Defendant's motion on the asserted APA claim.

2. Workplace Discrimination
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides, save exceptions not applicable here, that "[a]ll personnel actions affecting [federal] employees or applicants for [federal] employment . . . shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a). It authorizes a federal employee like Plaintiff to "file a civil action as provided in section 2000e-5[.]" Id. § 2000e-16(c).
Similarly, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability" shall be discriminated against by a federal agency "solely by reason of her or his disability." Ward v. McDonald, 762 F.3d 24, 28 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)). It also requires federal employers to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." Stewart v. St. Elizabeths Hosp., 589 F.3d 1305, 1307 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) (incorporated into the Rehabilitation Act by 29 U.S.C. § 791(g)). To prevail on a reasonable accommodation claim, a plaintiff must "produce sufficient evidence that (1) she was a qualified individual with a disability, (2) [Defendant] had notice of her disability and (3) [Defendant] denied her request for a reasonable accommodation." Ward, 762 F.3d at 31 (citation omitted).
The Rehabilitation Act adopts the jurisdictional and procedural provisions of Title VII. See Williams v. Perdue, 386 F. Supp. 3d 50, 54 (D.D.C. 2019). The [*21]  Title VII claims and the Rehabilitation Act claims are discussed in turn below.

B. Title VII Claims

1. Discrete Acts of Discrimination
As applicable here, Title VII, "prohibits the federal government from discriminating in employment on the grounds of . . . sex, and from retaliating against employees for engaging in activity protected by Title VII." Montgomery v. Chao, 546 F.3d 703, 706 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16) (other citations omitted)); see Rochon v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 1211, 1219 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (stating that the "general ban on retaliation in [42 U.S.C.] § 2000e-3(a)" applies to federal employers through 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16). "While Title VII's protection against discrimination is quite straightforward, the process for enforcing that right is labyrinthine. Federal employees, most of whom are proceeding on their own without legal counsel, have to navigate a maze of administrative processes before they can bring a claim to federal court." Niskey v. Kelly, 859 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (citation omitted)). Complexities notwithstanding, "if an employee fails to meet any of [the] statutory or regulatory deadlines, the employee's federal court action may be dismissed for failure to administratively exhaust the claim." Id. at 7.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claims based on single acts of discrimination occurring before March 14, 2014, should be dismissed. See Def.'s Mem., Dkt. 31-2 at 21-22. The [*22]  Court agrees. A federal employee "subjected to discriminatory action . . . must within 45 days contact a counselor in the employing agency's equal employment opportunity office." Niskey, 859 F.3d at 5-6 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1)). Thereafter,
[a]t that initial meeting, the EEO counselor is required to provide the employee with a written document that outlines [her] rights and responsibilities in the employing agency's EEO process. The counselor is supposed to investigate the claim and, within 30 days of that initial meeting, conduct a final interview with the employee. If the issue has not been resolved by the time of the final interview, the EEO counselor is required to provide the employee with a written document informing him that he has the right to file a formal discrimination complaint with the employing agency.
Id. (internal citations omitted)).
It is undisputed that Plaintiff first "contacted an EEO counselor" on April 18, 2014, Def.'s Facts ¶ 30, beyond the 45-day window for events that allegedly occurred in February.4 Perhaps because the February events are encompassed within the hostile work environment claim discussed below, Plaintiff has articulated no plausible reason to consider equitable tolling. See Niskey, 859 F.3d at 7 ("An employee [*23]  is entitled to equitable tolling if [s]he demonstrates (1) that [s]he has been pursuing [her] rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in [her] way.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). In any event, the Court will grant summary judgment to Defendant on the discrete claims arising from (1) the two alleged events on February 18, 2014 -- the most relevant being when Pineiro threatened to remove Plaintiff "if she could not perform duties because of her disability," and (2) the alleged event on February 28, 2014, when Pineiro "in an unprovoked violent rage" during a staff meeting "demanded" that Plaintiff "and a few other females verbally acknowledge" his statements to respect him or suffer consequences. Final Dec. at 3 (Claim at Issue ¶¶ 1, 2, 3); Compl.at 4-5.
The exhausted discrimination claims "based on sex (female)—and potentially race (African American)," Def.'s Mem. at 21, may be proved by direct evidence or circumstantial evidence.5 "Direct evidence of discriminatory intent alone is sufficient to survive summary judgment." Robinson v. Red Coats, Inc., 31 F. Supp. 3d 201, 216 (D.D.C. 2014) (citing Stone v. Landis Constr. Corp., 442 Fed. App'x. 568, 569 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (per curiam)). "While courts have not precisely defined what constitutes direct evidence, it is clear that [*24]  at a minimum, direct evidence does not include stray remarks in the workplace, particularly those made by nondecision-makers or statements made by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself." Hajjar-Nejad v. George Washington Univ., 37 F. Supp. 3d 90, 125 (D.D.C. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, the Court analyzes Title VII claims under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). Under this framework, the plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence, see McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, Stella v. Mineta, 284 F.3d 135, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2002), which is not a difficult task. See Brown v. Brody, 199 F.3d 446, 452 (D.C. Cir. 1999) ("[T]o state a prima facie claim of disparate treatment discrimination, the plaintiff must establish that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the unfavorable action gives rise to an inference of discrimination."). If the plaintiff is successful, the "burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for its actions. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If the employer provides such an explanation of its conduct, the central question on a motion for summary judgment is whether "the employee produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer's [*25]  asserted nondiscriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee" on a protected basis. Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Courts "may not second-guess an employer's personnel decision absent demonstrably discriminatory motive." Fischbach v. District of Columbia Dep't of Corrections, 86 F.3d 1180, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Consequently, the plaintiff "bears the ultimate burden of proving that discriminatory animus was the determining cause of the personnel action." Lancaster v. Vance-Cooks, 967 F. Supp. 2d 375, 393 (D.D.C. 2013) (citing Ford v. Mabus, 629 F. 3d 198, 201 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (other citation omitted)).
Similarly, to prevail on a retaliation claim, the plaintiff "must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing (1) that [she] engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) that [she] suffered a materially adverse action by [her] employer; and (3) that a causal link connects the two." Jones v. Bernanke, 557 F.3d 670, 677 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Thereafter, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its actions. Id. "If the employer does so, the burden-shifting framework disappears, and a court reviewing summary judgment looks to whether a reasonable jury could infer . . . retaliation from all the evidence[.]" Id. (citation omitted). Unlike discrimination claims, "Title VII retaliation claims must [*26]  be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation. . . . This requires proof that unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful actions of the employer." Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360 (2013).
As set out above, Defendant's well-documented performance-based reasons for terminating Plaintiff's employment were legitimate and nondiscriminatory. See Dkt. 31-22. Plaintiff has adduced no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find or infer that the decision had anything to do with her gender. And while a jury may infer from some of the statements attributed to Pineiro his dislike of Plaintiff, that fact alone cannot plausibly satisfy the "but-for" standard of proof required of a Title VII retaliation claim.

2. Hostile Work Environment
Title VII also prohibits a hostile work environment as a form of discrimination. "Hostile environment claims are different in kind from discrete acts. Their very nature involves repeated conduct" that may extend over days or years; thus, "a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own." Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 115 (2002) (citation omitted). "When the workplace is permeated with 'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult' that is 'sufficiently severe or [*27]  pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment,' Title VII is violated." Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (internal citations omitted). Courts must look "to the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, its offensiveness, and whether it interferes with an employee's work performance" to determine whether a hostile work environment exists. Baloch v. Kempthorne, 550 F.3d 1191, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 787-88 (1998) (emphasis added))). But the standards for judging hostility must be "sufficiently demanding to ensure that Title VII does not become a 'general civility code.'" Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275. Consequently, "conduct must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment." Id.
To support her claim of hostile work environment, Plaintiff cited, and the agency investigated, the following ten events.
1. On February 18, 2014, during a new hire meeting, [Pavlik-Keenan] sat at her desk on the telephone with her back to employees cussing profusely. During the same meeting, [Pineiro] threatened to fire new employees if he saw any bad attitudes from the new employees within the first thirty days (30 days).
2. On February 18, 2014, upon [Plaintiff] verbally making a request for [*28]  a reasonable accommodation with [Pineiro], he threatened to remove her from her position, if she could not perform her duties because of her disability. The [Plaintiff] stated she did not receive the requested accommodation until April 23, 2014.
3. On or about February 28, 2014, during a staff meeting, [Pineiro] "flew into an unprovoked violent rage," turning [red] in the face, clinching his teeth and fists, and looking at [Plaintiff] yelled, "I don't tolerate disrespect. You talking while I am talking is totally unacceptable. Nobody disrespects me. If you want to play with me, I'll come at you so hard and snatch you up — I'll make your head spin." The [Plaintiff] stated that [Pineiro] demanded that she and a few other females verbally acknowledge their understanding of what he said.
4. During the week of April 2, 2014, the [Plaintiff] stated that she overheard [Pavlik-Keenan] yell, "I hate that bitch" after returning from a meeting in the building. The [Plaintiff] stated that she and another paralegal were taken aback that [Pavlik-Keenan] and [Pineiro] would yell something that vulgar in the presence of their subordinates in an open forum.
5. On or about April 17, 2014, the [Plaintiff] [*29]  stated [Pavlik-Keenan] and [Pineiro] accused her of changing the standard FOIA letter.
6. On April 18, 2014, the [Plaintiff] stated that [Pineiro] raised his voice at her, as he counseled her for changing the standard FOIA letter and then assassinated her character by stating:
a. Your performance is subpar — you have not been meeting your numbers and I will have to get rid of you.
b. You have a bad attitude.
c. You fight back at every little detail.
d. You're arrogant.
e. You're disrespectful.
f. You don't listen.
g. You don't take well to training.
h. You argue every point.
i. I am going to have to dismiss you from this program.
7. On April 19, 2014, the [Plaintiff] stated that [Pineiro] and [Supervisory Paralegal Todd Fuss] submitted [a] termination letter, denied her access to FileMaker Pro Software and manipulated her FOIA casework.
8. On or about April 23, 2014, the [Plaintiff] stated that [Fuss] went through her briefcase, purse and other personal [belongings] and took a draft copy of this petition.
9. On May 2, 2014, the [Plaintiff] stated that [Fuss] emailed her and told her that she needed to move to another workstation. [Plaintiff] stated that the new location was in a busier and louder [*30]  part of the office and asked that she remain where she was. [Plaintiff] stated that [Pineiro] then ordered her to move.
10. On May 21, 2014, the [Plaintiff] stated that [Pineiro] stood in the area near the entrance of her workstation and began singing, "Oh what a glorious day it's a glorious day." [Plaintiff] also stated that [Pavlik-Keenan] and another manager issued her a termination letter.
Dkt. 31-25 at 2-3. Plaintiff has not alleged, much less shown, that those events resulted in a materially adverse employment action. See Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788 ("offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the 'terms and conditions of employment.'"). Nevertheless, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment because no reasonable jury presented with the foregoing evidence could find the conduct so severe or pervasive as to constitute a hostile work environment, much less one permeated with discriminatory animus because of Plaintiff's sex. See Childs—Pierce v. Util. Workers Union of Am., 383 F. Supp. 2d 60, 79 (D.D.C. 2005), aff'd 187 Fed. App'x. 1 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (rejecting the plaintiff's "attempts to cobble together a hostile work environment claim from discrete acts of alleged discrimination against her that are neither severe nor widespread"); accord Beckwith v. Ware, 174 F. Supp. 3d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2014), aff'd [*31] , No. 15-5102, 2015 WL 9005393 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 6, 2015) (rejecting "nine alleged acts" underlying hostile work environment claim where "they—collectively or individually—are neither severe nor pervasive") (surveying cases)). Consequently, summary judgment on the Title VII claims favors Defendant.

C. Rehabilitation Act
Finally, the Rehabilitation Act claim is grounded upon two decisions concerning workplace accommodations. A "basic tenet" of the Act "is that the Government must take reasonable affirmative steps to accommodate the handicapped, except where undue hardship would result." Ward, 762 F.3d at 28 (quoting Barth v. Gelb, 2 F.3d 1180, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted)). A "'reasonable accommodation' may include 'job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.'" Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); accord 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o ) (2)(ii)). Because "[f]ew disabilities are amenable to one-size-fits-all accommodations," Ward, 762 F.3d at 31, the employing agency, once aware of the disability and need for accommodation, should "initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation" to "identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." Id. at 32 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o) (3) [*32] ; Mogenhan v. Napolitano, 613 F.3d 1162, 1167 & n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2010)). "The process contemplated is 'a flexible give-and-take' between employer and employee 'so that together they can determine what accommodation would enable the employee to continue working." Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). "[N]either party should be able to cause a breakdown in the process for the purpose of either avoiding or inflicting liability." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
The evidentiary record demonstrates that Plaintiff's request for a wireless mouse was granted in a reasonably short time after she provided medical documentation. Plaintiff alleges, however, that this accommodation request resulted in "reprisal and disparate treatment[.]" Compl. at 1; see Pl.'s Mem. at 2 (request for "device . . . ignited Mr. Pinero's disparate treatment of Plaintiff"). But she has pointed to nothing in the summary judgment record supportive of those conclusions, and a court "is not 'obliged to sift through hundreds of pages of . . . affidavits," administrative documents, and hearing transcripts "in order to make [its] own analysis and determination of what may, or may not, be a genuine issue of material disputed fact.'" Potter v. District of Columbia., 558 F.3d 542, 550 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Twist v. Meese, 854 F.2d 1421, 1425 (D.C. Cir. 1988)); see Dkt. 32 (order informing plaintiff of her obligations in responding to defendant's summary judgment motion). Consequently, summary judgment on the wireless mouse accommodation favors Defendant.
The record surrounding the May 2, 2014 decision to relocate Plaintiff's workspace is more problematic. Defendant argues that jurisdiction is lacking under the Rehabilitation Act because Plaintiff failed [*33]  to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to "any failure to accommodate in connection with the movement of Plaintiff's workspace on or about May 2, 2014." Def.'s Mem. at 38. But the May 2nd relocation decision was among the ten events investigated at the administrative level, and Gowins' affidavit corroborated Plaintiff's version of events. Gowins averred (1) that Plaintiff was indeed moved "to a desk right next to a copier, away from where we had arranged for her to sit"; (2) that she informed Pineiro that "the copier was a problem for [Plaintiff]"; and (3) that she sent Pineiro Plaintiff's "email saying she would prefer not to have that desk" because of the noise and distractions.6 Gowins Aff., Dkt. 31-8 at 28. Rather than refer Plaintiff to the Civil Rights Office to begin the interactive process, as was done before, Pinero's reply to Gowins was "so" and "You know she's going to complain." Gowins Aff. at 28. For these reasons -- coupled with the prevalence of the disability discrimination claim in the pre-complaint process, the formal complaint, and the administrative proceedings -- the Court finds at the very least the existence of a materially factual dispute surrounding [*34]  the exhaustion of the workspace relocation claim to preclude summary judgment on the exhaustion defense.

IV. CONCLUSION AND ORDER
For the foregoing reasons, it is
ORDERED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part without prejudice. The motion is granted as to all claims except the Rehabilitation Act accommodation and retaliation claims arising from the May 2, 2014 relocation of Plaintiff's workspace; it is further
ORDERED that Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED; and it is further
ORDERED that pursuant to Local Civil Rule 16.3, the parties shall confer on the surviving Rehabilitation Act claims and file a report and proposed schedule on or before April 29, 2022. "The report shall be submitted jointly, but the parties may submit alternative proposed orders that reflect any disagreements[,] and [t]he plaintiff [has] the duty to ensure timely filing of the report." LCvR 16.3(d).
SO ORDERED.
