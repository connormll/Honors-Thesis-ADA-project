Opinion



ORDER
Plaintiff Devonna Culpepper brings this action against defendant Thomas J. Vilsak, Secretary, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), alleging discrimination on the basis of disability (which this Court determines is pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.) and retaliation for previously engaging in protected activities. The matter is before the Court on motion of USDA to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 [doc.#34]. Plaintiff has responded in opposition to USDA's motion, and USDA has filed a reply to plaintiff's response. Having considered the matter, the Court denies USDA's motion to dismiss and for summary judgment.
I.
Plaintiff is employed as a Loan Technician, GS-7, in the Single Family [*2]  Housing Section of the State Office of Rural Development, an agency of USDA, in Little Rock, Arkansas. She has been employed by Rural Development and its predecessor since 1979. Plaintiff is hearing impaired, with a rating at 95% decibel loss, and has been so impaired throughout her employment with USDA.
On January 17, 2005, plaintiff sent a letter requesting to file a complaint alleging discrimination to USDA, Director, Office of Civil Rights (OCR), in Washington, D.C. In her letter, which was received by OCR on January 21, 2005, plaintiff stated, in part, as follows:
This letter, along with supporting documentation will serve as my request to file a Complaint of Discrimination against USDA/Rural Development. My complaint is based upon retaliation from prior complaints CR960209 and No. 4:02CV00588 WRW, and for continuing Acts of Discrimination by Rural Development an Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture.
The primary allegation was related to Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcement Number AR-05-01 for the position of Purchasing Agent.
Over one year later, on February 6, 2006, plaintiff filed this action, No. 4:06cv00180 SWW, alleging discrimination on the basis of her disability [*3]  and retaliation for previous statutorily protected activity in the form of the 1996 charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) — CR960209 — and the 2002 lawsuit against USDA, Culpepper v. Veneman, No. 5:02cv00588 WRW (originally numbered 5:02cv00205 WRW), which was settled in 2004.
On May 22, 2006, plaintiff sent a second letter requesting to file a complaint alleging discrimination to the Director of OCR in Washington, D.C. In her letter, which was received by OCR on June 2, 2005, plaintiff stated, in part, as follows:
This letter, along with supporting documentation will serve as my request to file a Complaint of Discrimination against Rural Development an Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. As directed by Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcement No. AR-06-09, the complaint is being submitted to the address provided on the announcement which is the address shown above. My complaint is based upon retaliation from prior complaints, prior and current civil actions and for continuing Acts of Discrimination by the Agency.
The primary allegation was related to Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcement Number AR-06-09 for the position of Loan [*4]  Specialist.
Plaintiff twice requested a status of her January 17, 2005, and May 22, 2006, administrative complaints by email, first on September 20, 2006, and again on October 5, 2006, but no response was ever received. By letter dated October 24, 2006, plaintiff requested a Final Agency Decision (FAD) on her first administrative complaint received by OCR on January 21, 2005. By letter dated November 29, 2006, plaintiff requested a FAD on her second administrative complaint received by OCR on June 2, 2006.
In response to plaintiff's letters requesting a FAD on her two administrative complaints, Sadhna G. True, Director of OCR, informed plaintiff by letter dated December 11, 2006, that OCR had no record of receiving plaintiff's two administrative complaints and that the Rural Development civil rights office had no record that she contacted the office to initiate the informal process on her Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) concerns. True instructed plaintiff to contact the Rural Development civil rights office if she wished to initiate an EEO complaint and informed her that she must initiate contact with an EEO counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory. [*5] 
Plaintiff responded to True's letter by noting that OCR did in fact receive her two administrative complaints as evidenced by two green cards signed by a USDA employee accepting the two complaints. Nevertheless, no FAD was issued on plaintiff's two administrative complaints, OCR having apparently lost both complaints.
On February 13, 2007, plaintiff sought leave to amend her complaint in this action, which this Court granted, and plaintiff filed her amended complaint on March 2, 2007. Plaintiff's amended complaint states that USDA has discriminated against her by the failure to adequately make reasonable accommodations for her hearing impairment and that she seeks relief pursuant to the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., as well as for retaliation for having previously engaged in protected activities. Am. Compl. at ¶ 1.2 She further states that USDA has failed to provide her with a FAD on either the January 17, 2005 administrative complaint or the May 22, 2006 administrative complaint and that all administrative remedies for both of those complaints have therefore been exhausted. Id. at ¶ 28.
USDA subsequently moved to dismiss for plaintiff's failure to exhaust [*6]  her administrative remedies. This Court granted USDA's motion, finding that plaintiff failed to initiate contact with an EEO counselor within 45 days of the alleged discrimination, despite knowing the procedures for doing so, and instead sought waiver of those procedures. Plaintiff appealed and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, finding that plaintiff's letters to the Director of the USDA's Office of Civil Rights satisfied the EEO counselor contact requirement even though she did not contact an EEO counselor. Culpepper v. Schafer, 548 F.3d 1119 (8th Cir 2008).
Upon remand, the Court issued a scheduling order establishing discovery and motions deadlines of December 22, 2009, and a trial date of February 22, 2010. Thereafter, on December 21, 2009, USDA filed the motion to dismiss and for summary judgment now before the Court.
II.
USDA moves to dismiss and for summary judgment on the following grounds: (1) plaintiff's amended complaint does not state a claim for failure to make a reasonable accommodation and plaintiff in any case cannot establish a prima facie case of failure to make reasonable accommodation for her hearing impairment; (2) USDA has legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons why plaintiff was [*7]  not selected for the Purchasing Agent position in November 2004 and plaintiff cannot demonstrate pretext; (3) the alleged "restrictive language" in Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcements during the period February 2005 — February 2007 was not a requirement of the positions and did not disqualify plaintiff from applying, which she would have learned had she asked for clarification, and plaintiff did not apply for any of the positions announced by merit promotion vacancy announcements with the alleged discriminatory language nor did she ask for reasonable accommodation regarding the merit promotion vacancy announcements in question; (4) plaintiff's complaint does not state a claim upon which the court can grant relief based upon position upgrades received by other employees; and (5) plaintiff's claim that other employees' promotions as a result of additional duties and responsibilities violated merit promotions principles is not within the purview of the Rehabilitation Act, plaintiff did not timely exhaust her administrative remedies regarding promotions of other employees because of accretion of duties, and plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case that she did not receive a promotion [*8]  by accretion of duties because of disability discrimination or retaliation.
USDA argues that as to all other allegations, including failure of Arkansas USDA Rural Development to observe Disability Employment Awareness Month, plaintiff cannot make a prima facie case primarily because of the absence of a materially adverse employment action.
A.
In reviewing a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint, but is "not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id. at 1949. "Nor does a complaint suffice if it "tenders 'naked assertion[s]' devoid of 'further factual enhancement.'" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must plead "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal,     U.S.    , 129 S.Ct. at 1949. "The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more [*9]  than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). A well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it appears that actual proof of those facts is improbable and that recovery is very remote and unlikely. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. A complaint cannot, however, simply leave open the possibility that a plaintiff might later establish some set of undisclosed facts to support recovery. Id. at 561. Rather, the facts set forth in the complaint must be sufficient to nudge the claims across the line from conceivable to plausible. Id. at 570. "[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged — but it has not 'show[n]' — 'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Iqbal,     U.S.    , 129 S.Ct. at 1950 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)).
Summary judgment, in turn, is appropriate when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). As a prerequisite to summary judgment, a moving party must demonstrate "an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has properly supported its motion for summary [*10]  judgment, the nonmoving party must "do more than simply show there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but "must come forward with 'specific facts showing ... a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 587 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) and adding emphasis). See also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587 (citations omitted). However, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Id. (citation omitted). "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. "Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id.
B.
Although, as previously noted, the ADA is not available to plaintiff as a federal employees, Lewis, 180 Fed.Appx. at 600, cases interpreting the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are interchangeable because the same definitions and basic legal standards apply to both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Peebles v. Potter, 354 F. 3d 761, 765-66 n.4 (8th Cir. 2004); Buboltz v. Residential Advantages, Inc., 523 F.3d 864, 868 (8th Cir. 2008). The ADA and the Rehabilitation [*11]  Act recognizes claims of disparate treatment (i.e., intentional discrimination) as well as the failure to make reasonable accommodations. Peebles, 354 F.3d at 765.
In disparate treatment cases, a similarly situated disabled individual is treated differently because of his or her disability than less- or non-disabled individuals. Id. at 766. As such, the familiar three-step McDonnell Douglas approach is applied where no direct evidence of discrimination is available. Id.3 To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment on the basis of disability, plaintiff must show: (1) that she was disabled, (2) that she was qualified to do the essential job function with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) that she suffered an adverse employment action due to her disability. Buboltz, 523 F.3d at 868.4 If plaintiff makes this showing, the burden of production shifts to USDA to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action. Willnerd v. First Nat. Nebraska, Inc., 558 F.3d 770, 777-78 (8th Cir. 2009). If USDA meets this burden, the burden of proof lies with plaintiff to discredit USDA's stated reasons for the adverse employment action and show circumstances raising a reasonable inference that the real reason for the adverse employment action was her disability. Id. at 778.
An employer's [*12]  failure to make a reasonable accommodation is a separate form of prohibited discrimination under both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Buboltz, 523 F.3d at 870. If an employee fails to make a request for accommodation, then his or her employer has no duty to accommodate. Id. If, however, an employee does request an accommodation, the employer must engage in an interactive process to determine whether reasonable accommodations are possible. Id. If such accommodations are possible, then the employer must reasonably accommodate that request, but need not provide the exact accommodation requested. Id. To prove that an employer failed to participate in an interactive process regarding a reasonable accommodation, an employee must show the following: (1) that the employer knew he was disabled; (2) that he requested accommodations; (3) that the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist him in making accommodations; and (4) that the employer could have reasonably accommodated, but for its lack of good faith. Id. When an employer fails to engage in an interactive process, that is prima facie evidence of bad faith. Id.
Finally, retaliation claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are analyzed under the [*13]  burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas. Stewart v. Independent School Dist. No. 196, 481 F3d 1034, 1042-43 (8th Cir. 2007); Ozlek v. Potter, 259 Fed.Appx. 417, 422 (3rd Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Under this framework, the initial burden is on plaintiff to establish a prima facie case, consisting of evidence: (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action was taken against her; and (3) a causal connection exists between the two events. Stewart, 481 F.3d at 1043. If plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to USDA to show a non retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. If the USDA can show a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its actions, the burden returns to plaintiff who is then obliged to present evidence that (1) creates a question of fact as to whether USDA's reason was pretextual and (2) creates a reasonable inference that USDA acted in retaliation. Id.
1.
Plaintiff maintains that the evidence presented in this case demonstrates that she was discriminated against in her employment based on her profound deafness and in retaliation for prior complaints of discriminatory conduct on the part of USDA's representatives. She argues that the evidence demonstrates she "has hit the ceiling" and is not capable of future advancement because of the Arkansas USDA Rural Development's [*14]  many hiring practices that are designed to exclude her from consideration for future advancement, whether through accretion of duties, because of the restrictive language in vacancy announcements, and because of the practices of Merit Promotion Panels that are utilized by the Arkansas USDA Rural Development in its hiring practices. Plaintiff further argues that the USDA failed to make reasonable accommodations for her known disability, i.e., her deafness, and that there is no evidence that the accommodation of her known disability would impose an undue hardship on the USDA.
The Court has considered the record and will deny USDA's motion to dismiss and for summary judgment. While it may be that USDA will prevail at trial on some or all of plaintiff's claims, the Court finds that plaintiff has pled enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face, and that she has come forward with specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.5
III.
For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies USDA's motion to dismiss, and for summary judgment [doc.#34]. This action will proceed to trial as scheduled.
IT IS SO ORDERED this 10th day of February 2010.
