Opinion


ORDER
This matter is before the court on defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (DE 11).1 The issues have been fully briefed by the parties, and in [*2]  this posture are ripe for ruling. For the reasons that follow, the court grants defendants' motion.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
This case raises the issue of whether defendants reasonably accommodated plaintiff's alleged disability during the course of a state criminal proceeding. Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, commenced this action on April 4, 2018. Plaintiff claims his rights were violated under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 504 et seq.. He asks the court for various declaratory and injunctive relief, such as 1) restraining defendants from committing further unlawful acts while plaintiff is subject to criminal prosecution, 2) ordering defendants to correct any and all past judicial errors related to plaintiff, 3) imposing a monitor to oversee the defendants for ten years to enforce ADA compliance, and 4) declaring defendants violated federal law. Plaintiff also suggests that he incurred damages as a result of his being denied accommodations.
Defendants move to dismiss plaintiff's complaint on several grounds. Defendants contend that declaratory and injunctive relief are inappropriate while plaintiff's criminal proceeding is ongoing [*3]  under the Younger doctrine, and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine bars judicial review of a state judgment in federal district court. Defendants also argue that absolute judicial immunity and quasi-judicial immunity bar damages actions against them. In response, plaintiff argues that these doctrines do not apply.
On July 23, 2018, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction, asking the federal court to issue an order that "recommends, but does not require, a continuance be granted" in plaintiff's state criminal proceeding. (DE 37). The court denied this motion by its order dated August 3, 2018, which held that Younger v. Harris required abstention from interfering with state criminal proceedings. On October 11, 2018, due to an evidentiary dispute in the case, the court issued an order requiring defendants to produce a copy of the transcript of the trial in State v. Fuller, Case No. 17-CRS-50340. After being granted an extension of time, defendants complied with the court's request.2

STATEMENT OF THE FACTS
The facts in the complaint may be summarized as follows. Defendants are superior court judges, district court judges, and the clerk of superior court in Orange County, North Carolina. Plaintiff [*4]  has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder and severe migrane headaches ("ADHD") (Compl. ¶¶ 5, 6, 15). At several points in various academic and professional settings, he received reasonable accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"). (Compl. ¶¶ 17-20).
Plaintiff was charged with sending harassing communications to faculty and students at the University of North Carolina and Chapel Hill, and was to be tried in a state criminal proceeding on August 6, 2018. (Compl. ¶¶ 33-35). In anticipation of plaintiff's appearances in court, he requested ADA accommodations several times. (E.g., Compl. ¶¶ 37, 45, 46). Some of the accommodations plaintiff requested included: knowing when the hearing would start so he would know when to take his medication, having the court provide him with a diagram of how the proceeding would unfold, and not making unexpected changes to the court's agenda. (Compl. ¶ 48). Defendants did not respond to plaintiff's requests, denied plaintiff's requests, and chastised him at several points during the course of the criminal proceeding. (Compl. ¶¶ 37, 45, 46).
Additional facts pertinent to the instant motion will be discussed [*5]  below.

COURT'S DISCUSSION
A. Standard of Review
A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges the court's subject matter jurisdiction. Such motion may either 1) assert the complaint fails to state facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction may be based, or 2) attack the existence of subject matter jurisdiction in fact, apart from the complaint. Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982). Where a defendant raises a "facial challenge[] to standing that do[es] not dispute the jurisdictional facts alleged in the complaint," the court accepts "the facts of the complaint as true as [the court] would in context of a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge." Kenny v. Wilson, 885 F.3d 280, 287 (4th Cir. 2018).
"To survive a motion to dismiss" under Rule 12(b)(6), "a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). "Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. In evaluating whether a claim is stated, "[the] court accepts all well-pled facts as true and construes these facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff," but does not consider "legal conclusions, elements of a cause of action, . . . bare assertions devoid of further factual enhancement[,] . . . unwarranted inferences, unreasonable [*6]  conclusions, or arguments." Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v. Consumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 255 (4th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted).
B. Analysis
The court assumes for purposes of this motion only that the factual allegations contained in plaintiff's complaint are true, and considers whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction in this case or if plaintiff fails to state a claim. The court first considers whether the court is required to abstain from ruling on plaintiff's case pursuant to Younger v. Harris, and if so, whether staying or dismissing the case would be appropriate. Where plaintiff suggests he sustained damages, the court also addresses any damages claims raised by plaintiff.
1. Younger Abstention
The Younger doctrine requires federal courts to abstain from interfering with pending state criminal proceedings. Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S. Ct. 746, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1971). Younger abstention is appropriate where there is "(1) an ongoing state judicial proceeding, instituted prior to any substantial progress in the federal proceeding; that (2) implicates important, substantial, or vital state interests; and (3) provides an adequate opportunity for the plaintiff to raise the federal constitutional claim advanced in the federal lawsuit." Nivens v. Gilchrist, 319 F.3d 151, 153 (4th Cir. 2003). "[A] federal court may disregard Younger's mandate only where (1) there is a [*7]  showing of bad faith or harassment by state officials responsible for the prosecution; (2) the state law to be applied in the criminal proceeding is flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions; or (3) other extraordinary circumstances exist that present a threat of immediate and irreparable injury." Id.
Here, plaintiff's request for relief falls within Younger. First, there is a pending state criminal proceeding. See State v. Fuller, 2017 CRS 050340. Second, "North Carolina has a very important, substantial, and vital interest in preventing violations of its criminal laws." Nivens v. Gilchrist, 319 F.3d 151, 154 (4th Cir. 2003). Finally, plaintiff's "pending state prosecution provides the accused a fair and sufficient opportunity for vindication of federal . . . rights." Gilliam v. Foster, 75 F.3d 881, 904 (4th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (quotation omitted).
Plaintiff argues that the relief he seeks would not involve federal interference in his state criminal proceeding. However, the relief he seeks in his complaint suggests otherwise. The declaratory and injunctive relief plaintiff seeks, such as 1) restraining defendants from committing further unlawful acts while plaintiff is subject to criminal prosecution, 2) ordering defendants to correct any and all past judicial [*8]  errors related to plaintiff, 3) imposing a monitor to oversee the defendants for ten years to enforce ADA compliance, and 4) declaring defendants violated federal law all involve interference in plaintiff's criminal proceeding. (Compl. ¶¶ 65-69). Nothing in plaintiff's complaint indicates that his criminal proceeding, including all appeals, has concluded.3 Therefore, the court again finds that Younger abstention applies to this case.
The court now considers whether the appropriate course of action is to stay the case pending resolution of the state criminal proceedings, or whether dismissal is appropriate.
2. Rooker-Feldman Doctrine
The Rooker—Feldman doctrine bars federal courts from sitting "in direct review of state court decisions." District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 482-84, 103 S. Ct. 1303, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1983). "[T]he Rooker—Feldman doctrine applies only when the loser in state court files suit in federal district court seeking redress for an injury allegedly caused by the state court's decision itself." Davani v. Va. DOT, 434 F.3d 712, 713 (4th Cir.2006) (citing Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 125 S. Ct. 1517, 161 L. Ed. 2d 454 (2005)). This doctrine also prohibits a district court from reviewing federal claims that are "inextricably intertwined" with a state court decision. Shooting Point, LLC v. Cumming, 368 F.3d 379, 383 (4th Cir. 2004). A constitutional claim is "inextricably intertwined" with a state court decision if "'success [*9]  on the federal claim depends upon a determination that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.'" Id. (quoting Plyler v. Moore, 129 F.3d 728, 731 (4th Cir. 1997)).
As discussed above, there is no doubt that plaintiff seeks federal review of his state criminal prosecution by casting his complaint in terms of a violation of the ADA. The relief plaintiff seeks, namely judicial review of defendants' actions in district court couched in terms of "injunctive relief" requiring defendants to "correct any and all past judicial errors," (e.g., Compl. ¶ 66), is simply not allowed under federal law. See Feldman, 460 U.S. at 482-84. Plaintiff must raise his federal rights in his state criminal proceeding. His right of appeal is to the state appellate courts, and, if appropriate, the United States Supreme Court.
Plaintiff argues that Rooker—Feldman does not apply to his complaint. Based upon the relief plaintiff requests, the court disagrees. Plaintiff's complaint is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
3. Judicial and Quasi Judicial Immunity
Plaintiff fails to state a claim for damages, only conclusively asserting that he has sustained substantial damages by virtue of his court proceedings. (Compl. ¶¶ 55, 61). However, the court must also determine [*10]  whether to dismiss plaintiff's claim with or without prejudice.
Where plaintiff raises a claim for damages under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act,4 his claim is barred by judicial immunity. Judges are absolutely immune from damages actions unless they act with "clear absence of all jurisdiction." Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 356, 98 S. Ct. 1099, 55 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1978); Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 554, 87 S. Ct. 1213, 18 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1967). Moreover, a clerk of court enjoys quasi-judicial immunity for acts carrying out the will of the court. McCray v. Maryland, 456 F.2d 1, 5 n. 11 (4th Cir.1972) ("Since judges are immune from suit for their decisions, it would be manifestly unfair to hold liable the ministerial officers who merely carry out that judicial will."). Plaintiff argues that he has not been adequately accommodated in his criminal court proceeding, placing this case squarely within the jurisdiction of the court. (E.g., Compl. ¶¶ 45-48, 54, 59). Consequently, judicial immunity and quasi-judicial immunity apply in the case and plaintiff cannot recover for damages.
Plaintiff argues that judicial immunity does not apply because defendants' decisions are not judicial, but administrative in nature, citing Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219, 224-25, 108 S. Ct. 538, 98 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1988). In Forrester, the court refused to attach judicial immunity to a judge's decision to fire a court employee. Id. at 228-29. However, Forrester is inapplicable in this case. Here, the issue [*11]  is not whether the court made an administrative decision, such as firing an employee. Instead, the question is whether defendants properly conducted themselves during the course of court proceedings, specifically whether decisions made from the bench about how to conduct a criminal court proceeding properly accommodated plaintiff. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 32, 38-39, 44, 47). As alleged, these decisions by defendants are not administrative but judicial in nature, and thus trigger judicial and quasi judicial immunity for defendants. See Stump, 435 U.S. at 356. As the court discusses above, any "injury" plaintiff claims he sustained flows from his criminal case in state court, therefore he cannot claim damages because of defendants' immunity.
Plaintiff's damages claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are dismissed with prejudice.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. (DE 11).
Where defendants' motion to dismiss has been granted, the court DENIES as MOOT defendants' sealed motion (DE 58), defendants' emergency motion for protective order (DE 65), defendants' motion for leave to file reply (DE 67), [*12]  and plaintiff's motion to schedule the case for jury trial (DE 68). The clerk is DIRECTED to close this case.
SO ORDERED, this the 21st day of November, 2018.
