Opinion



ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
On December 16, 2010, Plaintiff Cinthya Aviles, proceeding pro se, filed a complaint alleging that Defendant Alutiiq Securities & Technology, LLC ("Alutiiq") discriminated against her because of her disability. (Doc. No. 1.) On September 20, 2011, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint asserting four causes of action: (1) disability discrimination under the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), (2) failure to engage in the interactive process required under ADA and FEHA, (3) refusal to accommodate her disability, and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Doc. No. 34.)
On May 17, 2012, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of Plaintiff's four causes of action for [*2]  failure to establish essential elements of Plaintiff's claims. (Doc. No. 68.) On May 31, 2012, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion. (Doc. No. 69.) On June 7, 2012, Defendant filed a reply. (Doc. No. 85.) On June 14, 2012, the Court held a hearing on the motion. Plaintiff appeared before the Court, and Paul Sorrentino appeared for Defendant. For the following reasons, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

Background
Defendant Alutiiq Securities & Technology is a government contractor that provides services to the United States government. (Doc. No. 68 at 6.) The government retains control over work orders, work assignments, the number of positions, and job duties that it contracts to Alutiiq. (Doc. Nos. 68-1 at 2, 68-3 at 43-44.)
In July of 2008, Plaintiff Cinthya Aviles applied for a position with Alutiiq. (Doc. No. 69-1 at 5.) In September of 2008, Alutiiq hired Ms. Aviles as a Computer Operator II to work with the Defense Automation and Publishing Services (DAPS) at the Balboa Naval Medical Center. (Doc. Nos. 68 at 6, 69-1 at 5.) Ms. Aviles' initial job responsibilities included scanning medical records into a computer system, operating a personal computer, [*3]  separating and sorting oversized pages, and insuring that paper clips and other fasteners were removed from documents. (Doc. No. 68-3 at 6-7.) Ms. Aviles walks with a limp. (Doc. Nos. 69-1 at 5, 68-3 at 12.) Ms. Aviles disclosed her disability to her manager at Alutiiq, Mr. Nicholas Leigh, shortly after she began working at DAPS. (Doc. No. 69-1 at 5.)
In March of 2009, Ms. Aviles was assigned to a position in the printing shop at the Naval Air Station, North Island. (Doc. Nos. 69-1 at 6, 68 at 7.) Ms. Aviles' job responsibilities at the Naval Air Station involved tasks that she found to be physically demanding. (Doc. No. 69-1 at 6.) In May of 2009, Alutiiq returned Ms. Aviles to the DAPS unit at the Balboa Naval Medical Center. (Doc. Nos. 69-1 at 6, 68 at 7.)
On May 28, 2009, Ms. Aviles lost her balance and fell while she was working at the Balboa Naval Medical Center. (Id.) She sustained an injury from the fall. (Id.) Ms. Aviles reported the injury to Alutiiq and visited the South Coast Medical Clinic in National City for a workers' compensation injury evaluation. (Doc. No. 69-1 at 6.) Alutiiq placed Ms. Aviles on workers' compensation leave. (Id.)
In July of 2009, Alutiiq laid off a [*4]  number of employees, including Ms. Aviles, when the government replaced a number of contract positions with civil service positions. (Doc. Nos. 68-3 at 16-17, 75-3 at 2.) Within two weeks of the layoff, Alutiiq rehired Ms. Aviles at her previous position, and at the her previous rate of pay, to work at the Naval Air Station. (Doc. No. 68-3 at 19-23.) In February of 2010, Ms. Aviles was reassigned to the Balboa Naval Medical Center. (Doc. Nos. 69-2 at 1, 68 at 7.)
On March 17, 2010, the government replaced Ms. Aviles' position with a government employee. (Id.) Alutiiq offered Ms. Aviles two other positions as a Medical Records Clerk and as a General Clerk II. (Doc. No. 68-3 at 48-49.) Ms. Aviles expressed interest in the General Clerk II position; a position that required a public trust background check for security clearance. (Doc. Nos. 69-2 at 1, 68 at 8.) After Ms. Aviles cleared the background check, Alutiiq contacted her to discuss employment options. (Id.) On July 15, 2010, Ms. Aviles provided Alutiiq with a physician's note indicating that she was unable to return to work due to medical restrictions. (Id.) Ms. Aviles provided Alutiiq with three additional physician's notes between [*5]  August and October of 2010 that indicated she remained unable to work until January 1, 2011. (Id.) Ms. Aviles is temporarily totally disabled. (Doc. No. 68-4 at 49-55.) From March until December of 2010, Ms. Aviles received disability benefits from the California Employment Development Department, and she currently receives disability benefits from Defendant's workers' compensation insurance carrier in the amount of approximately $1369 every two weeks, as reflected in the exhibits. (Doc. No. 68-3 at 84-85.) Alutiiq has not received medical clearance for Ms. Aviles to return to work from her doctors. (Id. at 84-97; Doc. No. 68-4 at 49-55.) Ms. Aviles remains listed in Aluttiq's computer system as an active employee on a medical leave of absence. (Doc. No. 68-1 at 3.)
On December 16, 2010, Ms. Aviles filed this lawsuit. (Doc. No. 1.) Ms. Aviles alleges four causes of action against Alutiiq: (1) disability discrimination under the ADA and FEHA, (2) failure to engage in the interactive process required by ADA and FEHA, (3) refusal to accommodate her disability, and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Doc. No. 34.) Alutiiq seeks summary judgment asserting that Ms. Aviles failed to establish [*6]  essential elements of her four causes of action. (Doc. No. 68.)

I. Legal Standard for a Motion for Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is appropriate under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A fact is material when, under the governing substantive law, it could affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute is genuine if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Id. When ruling on a summary judgment motion, the court must view all inferences drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The Court does not make credibility determinations with respect to evidence offered. See T.W. Elec. Service, Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n., 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987) (citing Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587).
A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. The moving party can satisfy this burden in two ways: (1) by presenting evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmoving party's case; or (2) by demonstrating that the nonmoving party failed to establish an essential element of the nonmoving party's case on which the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving at trial. [*7]  Id. at 322-23. Once the moving party establishes the absence of genuine issues of material fact, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth facts showing that a genuine issue of disputed fact remains. Id. at 322. The nonmoving party cannot oppose a properly supported summary judgment motion by "rest[ing] upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. "The 'opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material fact.'" Kennedy v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., 952 F.2d 262, 265-66 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586). Furthermore, "a party cannot create a genuine issue of fact sufficient to survive summary judgment simply by contradicting his or her own previous sworn statement . . . without explaining the contradiction or attempting to resolve the disparity." Cleveland v. Pol'y Mgm't Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 806, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999). Where the non-movant bears the burden of proof on an essential element of its claim and the movant demonstrates an absence of evidence in support of the element, summary judgment is appropriate. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323-26.

II. Discrimination Under the ADA and FEHA
Under the ADA, "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Likewise, the California FEHA makes it unlawful to discriminate against any person [*8]  because of a physical or mental disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940. "California relies on ADA precedents to interpret analogous provisions of [FEHA]." Allen v. Pacific Bell, 348 F.3d 1113, 1114 n.1 (9th Cir. 2003). Under the ADA and FEHA, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case for discrimination by demonstrating: (1) that they are disabled, (2) that they are a qualified individual, and (3) that they suffered an adverse employment action because of their disability. Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 988 (9th Cir. 2007); Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 886, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007).
Plaintiff's first cause of action is for disability discrimination under the provisions of the ADA and FEHA. (Doc. No. 34 at 4-5.) Defendant alleges that it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff has failed to establish essential elements of a prima facie case for discrimination. Specifically, Defendant maintains that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual because she cannot, even with reasonable accommodation, fulfill the essential duties of her position. Additionally, Defendant asserts that it has not discriminated against Plaintiff because of her disability.

A. Whether Plaintiff is a Qualified Individual
A qualified individual is "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such [*9]  individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that they are a qualified individual. Bates, 511 F.3d at 990. A totally disabled individual is not a qualified individual because, even with reasonable accommodation, the individual is unable to perform a job. Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1482 (9th Cir. 1996). If a plaintiff makes a "previous sworn statement asserting 'total disability' or the like, the court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary elements of an ADA claim." Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 807. "To defeat summary judgment, [the plaintiff's] explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that . . . the plaintiff could nonetheless 'perform the essential functions' of her job, with or without 'reasonable accommodation.'" Id.
In her deposition of January 24, 2012, Plaintiff admitted she has "never been able to" fulfill the physical requirements of her position with Defendant. (Doc. No. 68-3 at 46.) Furthermore, Plaintiff admitted that she would have preferred that Defendant never hired her because "scanning, copying, loading paper into a copier, laminating, drilling holes, stapling documents and removing paper clips was simply too physically demanding" for her. (Id. at 45.) Plaintiff also admitted [*10]  that she is unable to perform any type of work, and that her condition is never going to change:
A: It really wouldn't matter, because my condition is never going to change. You're asking me how long I'm going to remain disabled. I can sit here and every — every box and document you have here is going to say permanently, permanently, permanently. So it wouldn't matter whether I returned to work or not. My condition is never going to change.
Q: Well, what kind of work can you do?
A: Right now, none.
(Id. at 82.) The sworn statements made by Plaintiff indicate that she was unable to perform essential functions of her position. Plaintiff has not asserted that a reasonable accommodation was available that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her position as a Computer Operator II. Under Cleveland, Plaintiff is required to explain the inconsistency between her deposition statements and her burden to show that she was able to perform the essential functions of her position. Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 807. Plaintiff has not explained the inconsistencies, nor has Plaintiff shown that she was able to perform the essential functions of her position. Therefore, Plaintiff has not that made the required showing that she [*11]  is a qualified individual. See Bates, 511 F.3d at 988. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim because she has not established an essential element of her claim. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322 ("Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment . . . against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case.").

B. Whether Defendant Discriminated Against Plaintiff Because of Her Disability
Plaintiff bears the burden of showing that she was discriminated against because of her disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112; Bates, 511 F.3d at 994. The record indicates that Defendant did not discriminate against Plaintiff because of her disability. For example, Defendant hired Plaintiff in 2008 notwithstanding her visible difficulty walking. (Doc. No. 69-1 at 5.) Defendant placed Plaintiff on workers' compensation leave after she suffered an on-the-job injury. (Id. at 6.) Placement of Plaintiff on medical leave is considered a reasonable accommodation. See Humphrey v. Memorial Hospitals Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1135 (9th Cir. 2001) ("A leave of absence for medical treatment may be a reasonable accommodation."); see also Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 1999) ("Unpaid medical leave may be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.") (citing 29 C.F.R. Part 1630 app. § 1630.2(o)).
Plaintiff argues that [*12]  Defendant terminated her employment in retaliation for her accommodation requests. (Doc. No. 69-2 at 3.) Defendant contends that it terminated Plaintiff's employment in July of 2009 based on business necessity. (Doc. No. 68 at 7.)
In July of 2009, Defendant laid off a number of employees, including Plaintiff, because the government replaced a number of contract positions with civil service positions. (Doc. Nos. 68-3 at 16-17, 75-3 at 2.) Plaintiff acknowledges that the government had control over her position, and that Defendant did not have control in the government's decision to replace her contract position with a civil servant. (Doc. No. 68-3 at 16-17.) Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant's reduction in work force was a pretext to terminate her. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142-43, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (stating that "once the employer produces sufficient evidence to support a nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision," the plaintiff may show that "the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination") (citations omitted). The record indicates that Defendant laid off Plaintiff because of a business decision, and not due to her disability. Furthermore, within two weeks [*13]  of being laid off, Defendant rehired Plaintiff at her previous rate of pay. (Doc. No. 68-3 at 19, 22.) Also, Defendant offered, and Plaintiff declined, a purely desk position. (Id. at 29-30.) Plaintiff has not shown how Defendant's rehiring and offering her a desk position amounts to discrimination because of her disability.
The Court concludes that Defendant's actions demonstrate its willingness to hire, rehire, retain, and accommodate Plaintiff as an employee. In addition, Plaintiff remains listed as an Alutiiq employee on a medical leave of absence. (Doc. No. 68-1 at 3.) Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant treated her adversely because of her disability. An essential element of a discrimination claim is a showing that Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Bates, 511 F.3d at 988. As a result, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not established an essential element of a disability discrimination claim and that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323 (stating that a "failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial").
In conclusion, the Court determines that Plaintiff has not established that [*14]  she is a qualified individual, nor has she established that she was discriminated against because of her disability. Therefore, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's first cause of action because she has not established essential elements of a discrimination claim. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323 ("The moving party is 'entitled to judgment as a matter of law' because the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof.").

III. Interactive Process Requirements Under the ADA and FEHA
Under the ADA, "[o]nce an employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation, that employer has a mandatory obligation . . . to engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify and implement appropriate reasonable accommodations." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1137. Similarly, under the FEHA, "[i]t is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer . . . to fail to engage in timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940.
Plaintiff's [*15]  second cause of action alleges that Defendant failed to engage in an interactive process with Plaintiff. (Doc. No. 34 at 6.) The record indicates that, prior to Plaintiff's May 2009 accident, she performed her job duties without requiring accommodation. Defendant was not required to begin the interactive process with Plaintiff until it became aware of her need for accommodation. See Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1137 (stating that an employer is obliged to engage in an interactive process "[o]nce [the] employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation").
After the May 2009 accident, Plaintiff requested an accommodation to be assigned to a light duty position. (Doc. No. 69-1 at 6.) In response, Defendant placed her on workers' compensation leave. (Id.) Under the ADA, "[a] leave of absence for medical treatment may be a reasonable accommodation." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1135. Defendant offered Plaintiff two alternative placements as a Medical Records Clerk and as a General Clerk II. (Doc. No. 68-3 at 48-49.) Reassignment to a different position may be a reasonable accommodation. See e.g., Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 227, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). Defendant's actions indicate that it engaged in an interactive process and attempted to identify accommodations for Plaintiff's disability. In contrast, Plaintiff [*16]  has not provided factual support for her claim that Defendant failed to engage in an interactive process with her. Therefore, Plaintiff has not established an essential element of her claim for failure to engage in the interactive process under the ADA or FEHA. Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1137; Cal. Gov't Code § 12940. As a result, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's interactive process claim. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322 ("One of the principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims.").

IV. Plaintiff's Failure to Accommodate Cause of Action
To prevail on a failure to accommodate cause of action, a plaintiff must show "the existence of a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled [them] to perform the essential functions of an available job." Dark v. Curry Cnty., 451 F.3d 1078, 1088 (9th Cir. 2006). To avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff "need only show that an 'accommodation' seems reasonable on its face." Id. (quoting U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-402, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002)) (emphasis in original). An employer is not required "to exempt an employee from performing essential functions or to reallocate essential functions to other employees." Id. at 1089 (citing 29 C.F.R. Part 1630).
Plaintiff's third cause of action alleges that Defendant refused to accommodate Plaintiff's disability in her position as a [*17]  Computer Operator II. (Doc. No. 34 at 6.) Plaintiff states that she requested to be placed on light duty. (Doc. No. 75-2 at 2.) Yet, Plaintiff has not shown that she would have performed all the essential functions of a Computer Operator II if she had been placed on light duty. Also, Defendant offered Plaintiff two alternative desk positions as a Medical Records Clerk and as a General Clerk II at a lower rate of pay than her position as a Computer Operator II. (Doc. No. 68-3 at 48-49.) Offering an employee reassignment to a lower paid position that is commensurate in scope with their ability may be an acceptable accommodation. See e.g., Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 227. The record does not indicate that Plaintiff identified a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled her to perform the essential functions of an available job. Therefore, Plaintiff has not established an essential element of a claim for failure to accommodate. Dark, 451 F.3d at 1088. As a result, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure to accommodate cause of action. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322 ("Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment . . . against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential [*18]  to that party's case.").

V. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
A claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress requires a showing of: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of, or reckless disregard for, causing emotional distress, (2) that plaintiff actually suffered severe or extreme emotional distress, and (3) actual or proximate cause. Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal. 4th 1035, 1050, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009). Extreme and outrageous conduct is action that is "exceed[s] all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community." Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 6 Cal. 4th 965, 1001, 25 Cal. Rptr. 2d 550, 863 P.2d 795 (1993) (citations omitted).
The California Workers' Compensation Act preempts claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress in the employment context. Cal. Labor Code § 3600, et seq.; Livitsanos v. Super. Ct., 2 Cal. 4th 744, 754, 7 Cal. Rptr. 2d 808, 828 P.2d 1195 (1992). The workers' compensation system is the exclusive remedy available for on-the-job injuries, including injuries sustained from termination. Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., 43 Cal. 3d 148, 160, 233 Cal. Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743 (1987).
Plaintiff asserts that she suffered "much stress, anguish, embarrassment, humiliation, fatigue, [and] above all pain" during the course of her employment and litigation with Defendant. (Doc. No. 69-2 at 5.) Plaintiff contends that Defendant's "actions, or failure to act" have "drastically changed her life for the worse." (Id.) Therefore, Plaintiff alleges that the physical injuries [*19]  she suffered on the job "go hand in hand with emotion" such that she has suffered severe emotional distress. (Id.)
The Court concludes that Plaintiff has not stated a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. An essential element of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress are facts showing that Defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct. Hughes, 46 Cal. 4th at 1050. The second amended complaint and the parties' briefs describe how Defendant hired Plaintiff, laid her off, rehired her, extended offers of employment, and placed her on disability leave. None of these actions constitute extreme or outrageous conduct. See Cole, 43 Cal. 3d at 160 (stating that "actions which are a normal part of the employment relationship, such as demotions, promotion . . . and frictions in negotiations as to grievances" do not constitute outrageous conduct); see also Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics, 46 Cal. App. 4th 55, 80, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996) ("A simple pleading of personnel management activity is insufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress."). Therefore, Plaintiff has not made a factual showing that Defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct. As a result, Plaintiff has not established an essential element of a claim for intentional infliction [*20]  of emotional distress.
Furthermore, the pleadings do not allege facts showing that Defendant acted in an intentional or reckless disregard for causing Plaintiff emotional distress. An essential element of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is an assertion that Defendant possessed an intention, or acted with reckless disregard, for causing emotional distress. Hughes, 46 Cal. 4th at 1050. Therefore, Plaintiff has not established a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
In addition, Plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is preempted by California's Workers' Compensation Act. Livitsanos, 2 Cal. 4th at 754 ("[A]n employee's emotional distress injuries are subsumed under the exclusive remedy provisions of workers' compensation."). Therefore, Plaintiff's exclusive remedy for her emotional injury is provided by the workers' compensation system. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress because Plaintiff has failed to establish essential elements of her claim and her claim is preempted by California's Workers' Compensation Act. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323 ("The moving party is 'entitled to judgment as a [*21]  matter of law' because the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof.").

Conclusion
The Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment because Plaintiff has not established essential elements of her claims for disability discrimination, failure to engage in the interactive process, refusal to accommodate her disability, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322 ("Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment . . . against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case.").
IT IS SO ORDERED.
