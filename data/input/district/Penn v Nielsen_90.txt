Opinion



MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Currently before the Court is Defendant Kirstjen M. Nielsen, Secretary of U.S. Department of Homeland Security's, ("Defendant") Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. (Doc. 11). For the reasons outlined below, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss should be GRANTED and Plaintiff's Amended Complaint should be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. (Docs. 6, 11).

DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S AMENDED COMPLAINT

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Nicole Penn ("Plaintiff"), who is proceeding pro se, filed this lawsuit on May 31, 2018. (Doc. 4). Because Plaintiff initially filed her claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et. seq. ("ADA"), the undersigned issued a Report and Recommendation ("R&R") instructing Plaintiff that she could not bring ADA claims against Kirstjen M. Nielsen in her individual or official capacities because neither United States agencies nor individuals are considered employers pursuant to the ADA. (Doc. 3). Furthermore, the undersigned informed Plaintiff that the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 791, provides [*2]  the exclusive remedy for disability discrimination in cases involving employment by federal agencies. (Id.). Plaintiff amended her Complaint on June 14, 2018, asserting in one count a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, and on August 27, 2018, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, asserting that Plaintiff's claim is preempted by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, Pub. L. No. 107-71, 115 Stat. 597 (2001) ("ATSA").1 (Docs. 6, 11).
In Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, she avers that she is currently employed by the Transportation Security Administration ("TSA"), a division of the Department of Homeland Security. (Am. Compl. ¶ 4). Plaintiff, a Transportation Security Officer ("TSO")2 (Am. Compl., at 17), maintains that she is substantially limited in several major life activities and that Defendant failed to engage in an interactive process and neglected to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff upon her request. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 4, 6).
Plaintiff maintains that she was initially employed at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport,3 and that she contacted the human resources department in Raleigh in February 2012 after she visited physicians for "critical stomach pain." (Am. Compl. ¶ 6). Via testing at various physicians, [*3]  Plaintiff states that she was diagnosed with a blockage in her portal vein, the main vein that carries blood from the pancreas, spleen, gallbladder and gastrointestinal tract to the liver. (Am. Compl. ¶ 8). In March 2012, Plaintiff's request for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") was approved, and Plaintiff maintains that she requested extensions in May and October 2012. (Am. Compl. ¶ 6). Plaintiff also avers that in October 2012 she contacted Human Resources to discuss issues regarding tardiness that were occurring because of her condition. Id.
Plaintiff asserts that despite her requests to be reasonably accommodated via a change in her shift time, Defendant engaged in no interactive process to determine a reasonable accommodation and ignored her requests. (Am. Compl. ¶ 7). Particularly, Plaintiff maintains that her 5:00 a.m. shift was difficult to manage because her condition caused morning sickness, and she informed Defendant that she would be "more fit for duty later in the morning," after 8:00 a.m. (Am. Compl. ¶ 8). Plaintiff also contends that she was forced to reduce hours at her second job because she was unable to effectively ease the pain after her shift [*4]  ended with Defendant. Id.
In her attempt to seek a reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff avers that she explained her condition to her supervisor at the time and spoke to other members of management. (Am. Compl. ¶ 10). Plaintiff states that despite her requests, no information was provided to her as to why her petitions could not be met. Id. Instead, Plaintiff maintains that Defendant began to track her attendance and tardiness and instigated corrective action against her. Id. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that she was issued a "Memorandum of Counsel" by her supervisor in May 2013 due to tardiness and a second memo two days later for noncompliance in accordance with the attendance policy promulgated in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Id.
Plaintiff also contends that she was denied an opportunity to bid for another schedule, and although she was certified to conduct both passenger and baggage screenings, Plaintiff alleges she was precluded from bidding on a position she desired at a checkpoint location. Id. Plaintiff also argues she was denied this opportunity because she was being set up for failure, as her attendance was being tracked daily and she was restricted to clocking in [*5]  at only one location4 (her duty location), while this policy was not enforced as to all TSO's. Id.
Finally, Plaintiff asserts that she was placed on unpaid leave for thirty days while an investigation was apparently conducted after she was overheard stating that "this place would make a person want to go home and commit suicide." (Am. Compl ¶ 11). Although Plaintiff indicates that she apologized for the statement and was medically cleared two days after the incident, she was required to call out of work daily and was not paid, although this was not Defendant's typical policy, until she was approved to return to work. Id.

II. LEGAL ANALYSIS

A. Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Standard
Dismissal is warranted under Rule 12(b)(6) if, assuming the truth of the factual allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint, there is a dispositive legal issue that precludes relief. Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 326-27, 109 S. Ct. 1827, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1989); Brown v. Crawford Cty., 960 F.2d 1002, 1010 (11th Cir. 1992). In ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion, the court accepts the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construes them in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Hill v. White, 321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). Although it must accept well-pled facts as true, the court is not required to accept a plaintiff's legal conclusions. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Similarly, "unwarranted deductions of fact" in a complaint are not admitted [*6]  as true for the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the plaintiff's allegations. Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce, N.A., Inc., 416 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681 (stating conclusory allegations are "not entitled to be assumed true").
A complaint must be dismissed if the facts as pled do not state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. Factual allegations in a complaint need not be detailed but "must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (internal citations and emphasis omitted).

B. Plaintiff's Claim is Preempted by the ATSA
This Court finds that despite the undersigned's former recommendation that the Rehabilitation Act provided Plaintiff's exclusive remedy to bring a disability claim against a federal agency, due to Plaintiff's specific position within a federal agency, the Court has determined that Plaintiff's claim is preempted by the ATSA. Specifically, Plaintiff's claim under the Rehabilitation Act is barred by the ATSA because she is a Transportation [*7]  Security Officer, and, consequently, her claim fails as a matter of law and must be dismissed with prejudice.
The historical background surrounding the passage of the ATSA provides insight into its preemptive impact upon other statutes. Subsequent to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress assessed the condition of our national airport security, recognizing that the existing state of commercial airport security required changes in order to ensure the safety of civil air travel. 147 Cong. Rec. H8262-01, at H8275 (daily ed. Nov. 16, 2001). To that end, Congress enacted the Aviation and Transportation Security Act ("ATSA"), which, among other implementations, provided for the program of hiring and training security screening personnel. Pub. L. No. 107-71, 115 Stat. 597 (codified in various sections at 49 U.S.C.). Pursuant to the ATSA, the Under Secretary5 is given broad discretion in regard to hiring and the terms and conditions of employment of security screeners:
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security may employ, appoint, discipline, terminate and fix the compensation, terms, and conditions of employment of Federal Service for such a number of individuals [*8]  as the Under Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions of the Under Secretary under section 44901 of Title 49, United States Code. The Under Secretary shall establish levels of compensation and other benefits for individuals so employed.
Pub. L. No. 107-71, Title I, § 111(d), 115 Stat. 620, 49 U.S.C. § 44935 (codified as a note) (emphasis added).
The Eleventh Circuit addressed the impact of the ATSA upon certain requirements of the Rehabilitation Act in Castro v. Sec'y of Homeland Sec., 472 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir. 2006). In Castro, the plaintiff was not hired by TSA as a security screener because he failed the required medical assessment due to a history of non-epileptic seizures. Id. at 1335. Thereafter, the plaintiff initiated a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, alleging that TSA had violated the Rehabilitation Act when TSA discriminated against him on the basis of disability. Id. The Court held that "in the ATSA, Congress instructed TSA to develop hiring standards for security screeners, without regard to restraints the Rehabilitation Act may have imposed." Id. at 1338. Furthermore, the Eleventh Circuit reasoned that the phrase "notwithstanding any other provision of law" revealed Congress's intent that the ATSA was meant to take precedence over pre-existing or subsequently-enacted laws on the same subject matter. Id. at 1337.
In White v. Sec'y, Dept. of Homeland Sec., Transp. Sec. Admin., 478 F. App'x 587 (11th Cir. 2012), a pro se plaintiff appealed dismissal of his disability discrimination [*9]  claim under the Rehabilitation Act. Therein, the plaintiff maintained that he was unlawfully terminated as an airport security screener based on an unidentified physical disability. Id. at 587-88. In affirming dismissal of his case, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the district court's determination that the plaintiff could not state a cognizable claim of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, as "any such claim was preempted by the ATSA and fails as a matter of law." Id. at 588. The Court reasoned that
[u]nder [ATSA], the TSA may impose certain minimum physical qualifications for security screeners, [n]otwithstanding any provision of law. For example, security screeners must possess basic aptitudes and physical abilities, including color perception, visual and aural acuity, physical coordination, and motor skills, even though these standards would ordinarily run afoul of the Rehabilitation Act's prohibition against making employment decisions on the basis of a physical disability. Based on this inherent incompatibility, we have held that the plain language of the ATSA exempts TSA from compliance with the Rehabilitation Act in establishing employment standards for security screeners.
Id. (internal citations omitted); see also 49 U.S.C. § 44935(f). Notably, and as pointed out by Defendant, [*10]  in White v. Napolitano, the district court found that, "[a]s a result of the broad discretion the ATSA vests in the TSA, 'every circuit [court] to have considered the question [has] conclude[d] that the plain language of the ATSA preempts application of the Rehabilitation Act to security screeners.'" No. CV-10-S-2720-NE, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82858, 2011 WL 13175777, at *3 (N.D. Ala. June 8, 2011) (citing Joren v. Napolitano, 633 F.3d 1144, 1146 (7th Cir. 2011)); see also Id. at *4 (citing cases for proposition that, based upon the court's research, every court that has addressed the issue has "held that, because of the discretion vested in the Administrator of TSA and his delegates by the ATSA, a TSS [Transportation Security Screener] 'may not bring a claim of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Ace") (citing Joren, 633 F.3d at 1146)).
In Joren v. Napolitano, the Seventh Circuit, in a question of first impression, "join[ed] with every other circuit to have considered the question and conclude[d] that the plain language of the ATSA preempts application of the Rehabilitation Act to security screeners." 633 F.3d 1144, 1146 (7th Cir. 2011) (affirming dismissal of Rehabilitation Act claim against TSA made by a security screener with a blood-clotting disorder who was refused accommodation requests by her supervisor).
Similarly, in Tucker v. Ridge, the Eastern District of Texas concluded the following in a case wherein a plaintiff brought a claim under the Rehabilitation Act for the [*11]  unlawful denial of a position based on disability:
[f]or the court to allow Plaintiff to proceed with his Rehabilitation Act claim, the court would have to ignore the "notwithstanding" clause of the ATSA. Because the court cannot ignore provisions of the ATSA, [plaintiff's claims fail as a matter of law.
322 F. Supp. 2d 738, 743 (E.D. Tex. 2004).
In Pino v. Hawley, the Western District of Pennsylvania held the preemptive reach of the ATSA extended beyond the hiring process. 480 F. Supp. 2d 818 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 26, 2007). In Pino, the plaintiff brought a claim pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act against the TSA after he was terminated due to a medical condition that affected his job performance, to wit, that caused sleep deprivation. Id. at 820. The court dismissed plaintiff's claim, finding that the ATSA preempted the Rehabilitation Act, relying upon the operative words in ATSA that the Under Secretary may "employ, appoint, discipline, terminate and fix the compensation, terms and conditions of employment of those employed by the TSA . . ." (Id. at 824-25). The Pino court also relied upon another section of the ATSA, which states:
Notwithstanding any provision of law, [qualification] standards shall require, at a minimum, an individual-
. . .
(v) to have the ability to demonstrate daily a fitness for duty without any impairment due to illegal drugs, sleep deprivation, medication, [*12]  or alcohol.
Id. at 825; 49 U.S.C. § 44935(e)(2)(A)(v) (emphasis added). Construing these two provisions, the court maintained that "[t]he foregoing provisions evidence Congress's intent to give the TSA carte blanche with regard to all of its employment decisions regarding security screeners, including the termination of an existing employee who is deemed to be no longer qualified to perform his screening job due to his lack of daily fitness for duty." Id.
Other cases have discussed that Congress may exempt agencies from compliance with the Rehabilitation Act when other laws governing the workplace explicitly conflict with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. See, e.g., Center v. Dept. of Homeland Sec., Customs and Borders Prot. Agency, 895 F.3d 1295, 1302 (11th Cir. 2018) (discussing that the Court has held that the portion of the ATSA that establishes the qualifications for screening personnel "'exempts [TSA] from compliance with the Rehabilitation Act in establishing employment standards for security screeners'" (citing Castro, 472 F.3d at 1337)); Daniels v. Chertoff, No. CV 06-2891 PHX-JAT, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28750, 2007 WL 1140401, at *5 (D. Ariz. Apr. 17, 2007) (dismissing claim under the Rehabilitation Act as preempted by ATSA where plaintiff, an airport security screener, claimed he was denied a reasonable accommodation, finding that the TSA "is not required to provide accommodations to employees who are not capable of meeting the specific physical qualifications and employment standards promulgated pursuant to the ATSA"); [*13]  Yeager v. Chertoff, No. C06-074ORSM, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96076, 2006 WL 4673439, at *5 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 13, 2006) (holding "that the ATSA supercedes the Rehabilitation Act, and plaintiff may not pursue a reasonable accommodation claim brought under the Rehabilitation Act"). Accordingly, because Plaintiff, a TSO, seeks to bring a claim under the Rehabilitation Act against Defendant, Plaintiff's claim is barred as a matter of law and Plaintiff's Amended Complaint should be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing reasons, this Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss should be GRANTED and Plaintiff's Amended Complaint should be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE for failure to state a claim. (Doc. 6). As this is a final Report and Recommendation and there are no other matters pending before this Court, the Clerk is directed to terminate the reference to the undersigned. SO REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED, this 11 day of December, 2018.
