CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: ORDER GRANTING, IN PART, AND DENYING, IN PART, DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Pending before the Court are defendant Federal Express Corporation's ("Defendant") motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of issues, plaintiff Nerses Meguerditchian's ("Plaintiff") opposition, and Defendant's reply.1 [See Dkt. Nos. 36, 38-49, 51-53.]
Defendant's motion is suitable for adjudication without oral argument. See C.D. Cal. R. 7-15.
For the reasons discussed below, the Court GRANTS, in part, and DENIES, in part, Defendant's motion.

I.

Factual Background
In February 1991, Defendant hired Plaintiff as a global vehicle mechanic at its Canoga Park facility, and promoted him to senior global vehicle mechanic one year later. (Defendant's Separate Statement of Undisputed Facts ("DUF") at 1, 11; Plaintiff's Separate Statement of Additional Disputed and Undisputed Facts ("PUF") at 1-3.)
Plaintiff, one of two [*2]  senior mechanics employed by Defendant, maintained, inspected and repaired Defendant's field vehicle fleet. (Nerses Meguerditchian Deposition, dated August 27, 2013 ("Plaintiff Dep."), at pp. 122:5-22, 195:5-12, 256:6-22, 270:8-271:2; Exhs. 116, 2232.) Since 2009, Plaintiff had worked forty hours per week on the "p.m. shift" and, other than thirty minutes of overlap with Dan Benson, the "a.m. shift" mechanic, Plaintiff was the only mechanic on duty during his shift. (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 194:13-196:15, 198:4-199:8, 271:18-22, 447:19-23.)
In December 2010, Plaintiff was diagnosed with a spinal injury. (DUF at 43-45; PUF at 9-12; Exhs. 136-137.) Due to his injury, in January 2011, Plaintiff was placed on medical leave of absence and issued restrictions of "no lifting over 20 pounds . . . no push or pull work over 20 pounds . . . [and] [n]o kneeling or squatting." (DUF at 47; PUF at 13-14, 25; Exhs. 102, 140.) Defendant, however, informed his manager, Curtis Beck, that he wished to return to work. (Plaintiff Dep., at p. 287:2-25; Curtis W. Beck Deposition, dated October 8, 2013 ("Beck Dep."), at p. 49:2-7.)
Shortly thereafter, Beck contacted Myriam Rayne, the Human Capital Management Program ("HCMP") advisor responsible for administering [*3]  Plaintiff's medical leave. (Exh. 102; Rayne Decl., ¶¶ 4, 8.) Rayne subsequently mailed Plaintiff a letter outlining Defendant's leave policy3 and, pursuant to Beck's request, enrolled him in the Temporary Return to Work Program ("TRW"), a mandatory, maximum ninety day placement for employees who are "temporarily unable to perform the full range of job duties," but have "been released by a physician to return to work in a limited capacity[.]" (DUF at 7, 50-55; PUF at 18, 20, 29; Exhs. 102, 141, 231.)
Beginning on January 13, 2011, Plaintiff performed paperwork and preventative maintenance inspections ("PMIs") in TRW alongside Benson during his a.m. shift for twenty-five hours per week. (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 193:22-25, 287:13-288:11, 291:7-292:8; Beck Dep., at pp. 49:15-25, 68:16-18, 73:19-25.) During TRW, Plaintiff's doctors renewed his lifting restrictions and issued him bending restrictions. (Exhs. 143-45, 148.) In March 2011, following several denials of his doctor's requests for epidural injections, Plaintiff was issued new twenty-five pound lifting and "moderate bending" restrictions. (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 325:18-326:20, 330:3-8.)
Then, despite his objections, Plaintiff was terminated from TRW on April 17, 2011 [*4]  "pursuant to company policy." (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 49:4-24, 151:22-152:15.) On June 13, 2011, Plaintiff visited with Dr. Vincent Gumbs, a certified worker's compensation physician, who examined Plaintiff, and concluded that he was unable to perform his usual work and "should remain temporarily totally disabled" ("TTD") until his next visit. (Exhs. 115, 117-18; see also Vincent L. Gumbs, M.D. Deposition, dated October 14, 2013 ("Gumbs Dep."), at pp. 6:15-7:6, 13:14-19:11, 23:17-24:21.) Over the course of the next year, until June 2012, Dr. Gumbs reviewed Plaintiff's progress each month and issued reports renewing his TTD designation. (Exhs. 118, 120, 122, 126-27, 130, 133-35, 157, 174-75.)
On September 1, 2011, Plaintiff was transferred from Rayne to HCMP advisor Nancy Hanlon. (DUF at 104; PUF at 102.) The following month, Hanlon sent Plaintiff a letter advising him, in part, that his leave expired on January 17, 2012, and that, in the interim, she would help him look for an alternative position. (Exh. 158; see also Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 364:4-17, 372:1-373:25; Nancy Ann Hanlon Deposition, dated June 19, 2013 ("Hanlon Dep."), at pp. 102:6-104:2.)
From October 2011 until March 2012, Hanlon mailed Plaintiff weekly internal [*5]  job postings ("JCATs") and left him voice messages, several of which were unreturned. (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 363:1-24; Hanlon Dep., at pp. 45:23-46:5; Exhs. 101, 162-64, 166-68, 193-96, 198-206.) Beginning in January 2012, due to Plaintiff's ongoing treatment, Defendant extended Plaintiff's medical leave until April 2012. (DUF at 132-33, 136; Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 552:17-553:15; Exh. 101.)
On April 30, 2012, however, Hanlon officially terminated Plaintiff, and sent him a letter stating: "[s]ince you have been unable to return from leave by securing a position for which you are able to perform the essential functions, in accordance with the [medical leave policy] it is necessary to terminate your employment. Your leave has exceeded the maximum allowable by policy." (Exh. 209; see also Hanlon Dep., at pp. 144:18-145:3 (stating that, among other reasons, she terminated Plaintiff because he "did not have an interest in returning to work" and "didn't make an effort to secure any other position").) Finally, on June 12, 2012, Dr. Gumbs examined Plaintiff one last time and gave him permanent work restrictions. (Gumbs Dep., at pp. 98:23-102:16; Exhs. 182-83.)

II.

Legal Standard
Summary judgment should be granted [*6]  if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its burden, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and identify specific facts through admissible evidence that show a genuine issue for trial. Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Where the moving and nonmoving parties' versions of events differ, courts are required to view the facts and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007).

III.

Discussion
Now, Defendant seeks summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication as to Plaintiff's claims for disability discrimination, retaliation, failure to accommodate, and failure to engage in the interactive process under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12940 et seq. The Court addresses whether each claim can survive summary judgment below.

A. Disability Discrimination and Retaliation Claims
To prevail on summary judgment for disability discrimination and retaliation claims, the employer bears the initial burden to establish that: (1) plaintiff could not establish [*7]  one of the prima facie elements of discrimination or retaliation, or (2) there was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment. Dep't of Fair Emp't and Hous. v. Lucent Tech., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011). Should the employer make a sufficient showing, it "will be entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff produces admissible evidence which raises a triable issue of fact material to the defendant's showing" — namely — substantial responsive evidence that the employer's showing was untrue or pretextual for discrimination or retaliation. Yeager v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 944 F. Supp. 2d 913, 926 (E.D. Cal. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

1. Disparate Treatment Claim
First, to establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) "he suffers from a disability, (2) he is a qualified individual capable of performing the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation, and (3) he was subject to an adverse employment action because of the disability." Jackson v. Simon Prop. Grp., Inc., 795 F. Supp. 2d 949, 959 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (internal citation omitted).
Here, it is uncontested that Plaintiff suffers from a spinal disability, which ultimately led to his termination. (DUF at 43-45; PUF at 9-12; Exh. 209.) Yet, it is disputed whether Plaintiff could perform his essential job functions in light of his restrictions. [*8]  (Mot. at 15-16; Opp. at 17-21.) Equally true, and regardless of whether Plaintiff could perform such functions, a factual dispute exists over whether Hanlon's reasons for terminating Plaintiff — i.e. her belief that he did not wish to return to work — were "untrue or pretextual." (Id.) Thus, a question of material fact remains as to Plaintiff's disparate treatment claim.
At least two reasons guide the Court's determination.
Chiefly, and perhaps most notably, the parties quarrel whether, and to what extent, Plaintiff's physical strength was essential to his ability to change tires, repair brakes, and perform PMIs as a senior vehicle mechanic. On the one hand, Defendant argues that "Plaintiff has admitted that he cannot perform the essential duties of his job" by himself. (Mot. at 16.) In support, Defendant provides medical documents where Plaintiff represented that his position required him to "constantly" bend, squat and kneel, and to lift more than forty pounds at least 70% of the time during his eight hour shift. (See Exhs. 116, 179, 214.)
Plaintiff, on the other hand, disagrees, and objects to the veracity and authenticity of such documents. (See, e.g., Gumbs Dep., at pp. 128:1-130:16 (stating [*9]  that he did "not give much credence" to Plaintiff's job description form because Plaintiff "confused everything" by filling it out without Defendant's help); Exh. 116.) Indeed, Defendant's written job description contains no requirement that he work alone, lift a specific number of pounds, or possess certain physical attributes. (Exh. 223; see also Beck Dep., 54:25-55:7 (confirming no weight lifting requirement); Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 178:17-180:13, 198:4-199:8 (stating that bending was "not a daily act" and that he received help from Benson during their overlap shift).) Plaintiff also counters that he spent more time performing paperwork and PMIs, and less time lifting, than mechanics at other stations. (Plaintiff Decl., ¶ 3; compare Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 197:3-17, 201:14-203:13 (performing approximately 11-14 PMIs per week, each taking 2.5 to 3 hours) with Beck Dep., at p. 40:16-24 (calculating 1.5 hours "max" for PMIs).)
On this record, and even assuming that he was required to routinely lift and maneuver heavy weights, Plaintiff raises more than a specter of doubt that Defendant could have implemented alternative methods to alleviate such lifting. Generally, mechanics rely on [*10]  assistive tools and devices to perform their duties, and Plaintiff has now identified several devices that were indeed available, but never researched or purchased by Defendant, during his leave period. (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 463:3-472:22; Plaintiff Decl., ¶ 24; Hanlon Dep., at p. 55:1-4.) Further, Defendant has previously outsourced repairs to other stations and vendors, and it is unsettled whether the amount of outsourcing actually increased, as Defendant argues, while Plaintiff was enrolled in TRW. (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 215:22-218:22; Beck Depo., at pp. 81:2-85:20, 94:9-13.)
Thus, in light of Plaintiff's showing, a jury would be free to believe, or disbelieve, Defendant's judgment that Plaintiff could not, in fact, physically perform his essential duties due to his restrictions.
Second, the parties dispute the legitimacy of Hanlon's belief that Plaintiff did not wish to return to work. Specifically, Defendant avers that Plaintiff has presented "no evidence [that Hanlon] did not honestly believe Plaintiff did not want to return to work[,]" especially in light of his failure "to return several of her calls" or express an interest in, and apply for, a "single available position" during [*11]  the time he received JCATs. (Reply at 8.)
Yet, Plaintiff undercuts Defendant's argument by presenting evidence that he expressed interest in some positions. (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 378:3-381:25, 576:22-577:20; Hanlon Dep., at pp. 44:17-48:3, 93:16-94:6, 138:1-8, 148:5-12; see generally Hanlon Decl.) By way of example, Hanlon had called Plaintiff about an available import/export position at a nearby facility, but she never heard back from him. (Hanlon Decl., ¶ 17; Exh. 101.) Plaintiff, however, explains that he did inquire about the position, but only had one day's notice to apply and accidentally contacted the wrong facility. (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 168:12-172:10, 404:13-405:7, 504:1-505:22.) Finally, in another instance, it appears that Hanlon failed to investigate a position at Burbank Airport that Plaintiff had also inquired about. (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 378:10-381:25, 385:6-20.)
As such, based on the foregoing factual ambiguities, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's disparate treatment claim.

2. Disparate Impact Claim
Second, to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact, "a plaintiff must: (1) identify one or more specific employment practices at issue, (2) [*12]  show a disparate impact on a protected class, and (3) establish a causal relationship between the practice(s) and the disparate impact." Hardin v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178942, 2012 WL 6608568, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 18, 2012) ("Under FEHA . . . the employee must show that regardless of motive, a facially neutral employer practice or policy . . . had a disproportionate adverse effect on certain employees because of their membership in a protected group") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Then, "the defendant can rebut in one of two ways: (1) it can directly attack plaintiff's statistical proof by pointing out deficiencies in the data or fallacies in analysis, or (2) it can proffer evidence that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity." Id. ("The Ninth Circuit has recognized the necessity of statistical evidence in establishing disparate impact and not just relying upon asserting the logical consequences of a policy.")
Here, conspicuously absent from Plaintiff's papers is any statistical proof to support his disparate impact claim. Rather, Plaintiff conclusorily states that Defendant's medical leave and TRW policies have a "discriminatory impact on disabled [employees] with temporary restrictions[.]" [*13]  (Opp. at 21.) But Plaintiff produces no meaningful evidence to show that TRW deprives disabled employees of light duty work exceeding ninety days at a greater rate than non-disabled employees, let alone whether non-disabled employees have ever been enrolled in TRW. In fact, Rayne even recalls two separate instances in which TRW was extended beyond ninety days for disabled employees. (Deposition of Myriam Rayne, dated September 25, 2013 ("Rayne Depo"), at pp. 105:22-106:7.)
Thus, in light of Plaintiff's insufficient evidence, his disparate impact claim fails as a matter of law. See, e.g., Lopez v. Pac. Mar. Ass'n, 657 F.3d 762, 767-68 (9th Cir. 2011) (affirming summary judgment for employer on disparate impact claim where "both logic and precedent require [employee] to produce some evidence that tends to show that the one-strike rule [challenged by employee] excludes recovering or recovered drug addicts disproportionately"); Hardin, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178942, [WL] at *7 (granting summary judgment for employer where employee failed to present statistical proof to support disparate impact claim and "[w]ithout such proof, a plaintiff cannot show that there has been an actual impact on the allegedly discriminated group"); Life Tech. Corp. v. Super. Ct., 197 Cal. App. 4th 640, 650, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 80 (2011) ("Statistical proof is indispensable in a disparate impact case.") (internal quotation [*14]  marks and citation omitted).
Accordingly, Defendant's motion is GRANTED as to this claim.

3. Retaliation Claim
Third, to establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation under FEHA, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) his employer thereafter subjected him to an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the employer's action. See Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). Pursuant to FEHA's nonretaliatory provision, an employee engages in protected activity by "oppos[ing] any practices forbidden under this part" or by "fil[ing] a complaint, testif[ying], or assist[ing] in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h).
In this case, Plaintiff argues that he engaged in protected activity by his "attempt[s] . . . to remain at or return to work, and to initiate the interactive process[.]" (Opp at 24.) But according to Defendant, "initiating the interactive process, asking to remain at work and asking why he could not continue working" does not constitute opposing or complaining about discriminatory conduct prohibited by FEHA. (Reply at 10-11.) Plaintiff provides no case authority to the contrary. (Id. at 11.)
The Court agrees with Defendant.
Preliminarily, a review [*15]  of the case law reveals that Plaintiff's general attempts to remain at or return to work from medical leave, without more, do not qualify as protected activity under FEHA. See, e.g., Violan v. On Lok Senior Health Serv., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 182141, 2013 WL 6907153, at *11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 31, 2013) ("Under FEHA, requesting accommodations is not 'protected activity'; rather, "[p]rotected activities include opposing an unlawful employment practice, participating in a [] proceeding, and filing a complaint[.]"); Alcala v. Best Buy Stores, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181892, 2012 WL 6138332, at *11-12 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2012) ("Under the Yanowitz standard, simply airing a grievance complaining about or opposing a decision [] cannot amount to a protected activity" where "there is no evidence the employer knew that the employee's opposition [to an action] was based upon a reasonable belief that the employer was engaging in discrimination") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Indeed, to conclude otherwise, "the interpretation of 'protected activity' that Plaintiff advances would blur and perhaps vitiate the distinction between an action for failure to accommodate or engage in the interactive process and retaliation." Kelley v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 750 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1144 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (finding no protected activity where employee may have requested an accommodation by notifying employer of her worker's compensation medical status).
And here, Plaintiff provides no evidence [*16]  that his requests to remain at or return to work prior to his termination alerted Defendant to his belief that discrimination had occurred. (See, e.g., Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 286:24-288:11 (informing Defendant of his intention to return to work "full-time" postinjury, but not offering statements implying discrimination after learning about TRW placement); Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 49:4-24, 151:22-152:15 (stating he asked Beck and Rayne "why" he could not continue working TRW after April 2011 and they told him because of "company policy.").) To the contrary, Plaintiff even testified that, after Hanlon informed him about his pending termination during an April 2012 phone call, he responded with: "I don't understand why I'm getting terminated, why I cannot just go back to work. I can do the job . . . but I understand this, or something like that[.]" (Plaintiff Dep., at p. 577:16-20) (emphasis added). Under these circumstances, the evidence is insufficient to show that Plaintiff aired his concerns in a manner adequate to put Defendant on notice that he believed he was discriminated against.
Accordingly, because Plaintiff's requests do not amount to protected activity as a matter of law, Defendant's [*17]  motion is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

B. Failure to Accommodate Claim
Next, Defendant argues that Plaintiff "was reasonably accommodated by virtue of his medical leave and three extensions of that leave." (Mot. at 19-20; Reply at 13-15.)
To establish a claim for failure to accommodate a disability under FEHA, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) he suffers from a covered disability; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) his employer failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. See Cuillette v. City of L.A., 194 Cal. App. 4th 757, 766, 123 Cal. Rptr. 3d 562 (2011); see also Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1222, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899 (2006) (It is unlawful "for an employer to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an [] employee unless the accommodation would cause undue hardship to the employer.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
As an initial matter, since Defendant failed to establish — as a matter of law — that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual, for the reasons discussed above, the Court finds that summary judgment is equally inappropriate here.
For the sake of exactitude, however, one additional reason cautions against summary judgment here.
In the end, a question of material fact remains as to whether TRW, as opposed to another variation of Plaintiff's [*18]  original senior mechanic position, appropriately accommodated Plaintiff's disability. It is correct, as Defendant points out, that it need not transform a temporary position into a permanent one, or wait indefinitely for Plaintiff's medical condition to improve, to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff. See Raine, 135 Cal. App. 4th at 1224.
Yet Plaintiff has presented colorable evidence suggesting that Defendant may have hastily enrolled Plaintiff in, and then terminated him from, TRW without giving due consideration to his medical recommendations and restrictions. In particular, Beck admits that he spent only five to ten minutes evaluating Plaintiff's restrictions before delegating him to paperwork and faxing his TRW enrollment request to Rayne, who was altogether unfamiliar with Plaintiff's skills and job duties. (Beck Dep., at p. 48:14-20; Rayne Dep., at pp. 117:21-118:6.) Neither Beck nor Rayne, however, consulted with each other or Plaintiff's medical providers about his skills and restrictions. (Beck Dep., at pp. 50:13-52:8; Rayne Dep., at pp. 85:11-86:10.)
Plus, Rayne acknowledges she never considered extending TRW for Plaintiff because, in her opinion, he showed no signs of improvement. (Rayne Dep., at pp. 92:6-24, [*19]  101:20-102:10; Rayne Decl., ¶ 32.) Plaintiff, however, presents evidence that in March 2011, he continued to appeal the insurer's denials of his doctor's epidural injection requests, received an improved lifting restriction, and was generally frustrated with his overall medical access and care plan, all of which Rayne knew about. (Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 314:8-315:23, 319:23-25, 325:18-330:8; Hanlon Dep., at pp. 88:11-90:5; Exh. 101.) In fact, Plaintiff never even met with a certified worker's compensation physician until Dr. Gumbs in June 2011, nearly two months after he was terminated from TRW. (Gumbs Dep., at pp. 6:15-7:6)
Thus, because a reasonable juror could conclude that Defendant's leave policies failed to appropriately accommodate Plaintiff's unique medical situation in this case, the Court declines to grant summary judgment here.
As such, Defendant's motion is DENIED as to this claim.

C. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process Claim
Finally, after an employee with a known physical disability or mental condition requests a reasonable accommodation, employers must "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee [] to determine effective reasonable accommodations, [*20]  if any[.]" Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n); see also Spitzer v. Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1384, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000).
Then, once the interactive process has begun, both parties must "undertake reasonable efforts to communicate [their] concerns, and make available to the other information which is available, or more accessible, to one party." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 62 n. 22, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006); see also Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosp. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001) ("The interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and [] employees, and neither side can delay or obstruct the process."). "[I]f the process fails, responsibility . . . rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith." Avila v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1252, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008).
Here, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has no standing to assert an interactive process claim because he "remains unable to identify a reasonable accommodation that was objectively available to him during the interactive process" and, in any event, Defendant did engage in the interactive process. (Reply at 23-25.)
The Court disagrees for the following reasons.
Foremost, in addition to the alternative processes identified by Plaintiff above, following discovery, Plaintiff ascertained the following vacancies posted between April 2011 and October 2011: (1) Teamleader, (2) Service Agent, (3) Sr. Service Agent, (4) Service Assurance Agent, [*21]  and (5) Operations Agent. (Plaintiff Decl., ¶ 25; Boyle Decl., Exhs. 34-36, 38.) Defendant, however, challenges such evidence because Plaintiff "failed to provide any factual basis for why he was qualified to perform" these positions had he known about them. (Reply at 23-24.) But significantly, Hanlon testified that she was actually "watching for" jobs like "Operations Agent" for Plaintiff during her tenure with him. (Hanlon Dep., at p. 133:5-18.) Ergo, whether Plaintiff was, or was not, qualified to perform each position is a question for the trier of fact.
Next, the Court recognizes that Defendant did illustrate Hanlon's salient efforts to communicate with Plaintiff through her JCAT mailings and phone calls. (See Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 363:1-24, 405:15, 418:8-419:25; Hanlon Dep., at pp. 39:16-22; 81:24-82:23, 116:22-25, 133:5-13; Exhs. 101, 162-64, 166-68, 193-96, 198-206.)
But Plaintiff also provides considerable evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that Defendant did not, in fact, timely engage in the interactive process in good faith, or was at least responsible for its breakdown. In particular, during the first nine months of Plaintiff's medical leave, prior to [*22]  Hanlon's involvement, there is no evidence of any discussions between Plaintiff and Defendant about alternative positions within the company. (See e.g., Beck Dep., at pp. 95:13-96:14; Beck Decl., ¶ 38; Hanlon Dep., at pp. 98:7-100:3; Rayne Dep., at p. 94:19-20.) In fact, Rayne, who was equipped with knowledge that it was unlikely Plaintiff would return to his original position, had no contact with Plaintiff whatsoever between May 2011 and September 2011. (See e.g., Plaintiff Dep., at pp. 87:13-24, 327:9-328:24; Rayne Dep., at pp. 41:1-2, 49:19-22, 79:6-15, 80:21-82:7, 113:24-114:16; Exh. 101.)
Moreover, neither Rayne, nor Hanlon for that matter, ever personally met with Plaintiff, visited his work site, discussed his skills or restrictions with his managers or doctors, or evaluated assistive devices, potential job restructuring or certain training opportunities with him. (See, e.g., Hanlon Dep., at pp. 39:4-5, 55:1-4, 87:16-90:5, 125:1-128:10, 133:2-4, 178:12-21; Rayne Dep., at pp. 41:1-2, 49:19-22, 50:25-51:15, 67:20-69:5, 70:5-71:6, 85:11-86:10.) Both Rayne and Hanlon cannot even recall whether they discussed Plaintiff's job description with him. (Id.)
In sum, based on the foregoing, [*23]  conflicting inferences can be made regarding Defendant's seemingly good faith efforts to learn about Plaintiff's skills and restrictions, and explore possible accommodations with him, as required by the interactive process.
Accordingly, Defendant's motion is DENIED as to this claim.

IV.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS, in part, and DENIES, in part, Defendant's motion.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
