Opinion



ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS
This case is before the Court on Defendant's motion to dismiss (Doc. 23) and Plaintiff's response in opposition to the motion (Doc. 25). No hearing is necessary to rule on the motion, and for the reasons that follow, the Court finds that the motion is due to be granted in part.

Background
Plaintiff was employed by Defendant as an assistant state attorney (ASA) from April 2013 to April 2017. Plaintiff initiated this action against Defendant in his official capacity as State Attorney for the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit, alleging that she was subjected to various forms of discrimination (e.g., gender/sexual orientation, race/national origin, disability, retaliation) starting in 2016 when Larry Basford became Chief Assistant State Attorney and her direct supervisor. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the counts alleging disability-based discrimination (Count III) and [*2]  retaliation (Count IV).
Pertinent to these claims, Plaintiff alleged that when she was hired, she informed the previous Chief Assistant that she had been diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which is a chronic stomach ailment that "made it difficult for her to sit for more than a few continuous minutes, for her to stand for more than a few minutes, and for her to work in a constrained physical position, and she required a work situation conducive to frequent bathroom breaks." As a result, the previous Chief Assistant delayed Plaintiff's start date until a position became available with a felony division that was controlled by a judge who "ran his division at a pace that would be more accommodating to Plaintiff's bathroom needs, in contrast to the pace in other courtrooms."
On September 9, 2016, Plaintiff learned that her symptoms were not caused by Crohn's disease, but instead by a large mass that was fused to her uterus, bladder, and colon. Surgery to remove the mass was scheduled for October 18, 2016. Plaintiff informed Chief Assistant Basford and an office administrator of her condition, the scheduled surgery, and that her doctor prescribed a two-week recovery time post-surgery.
Plaintiff [*3]  returned to work 6 days after the surgery. Upon her return, Plaintiff learned that Chief Assistant Basford had reassigned her to a different judge's felony division. Although "numerous ASA's were moved during this time," Plaintiff alleged that she was the only ASA required to keep cases from her old division after being transferred to a new division. Also, every ASA who was reassigned received a raise except for Plaintiff.
Plaintiff's pre-surgery stomach issues were only expected to last for approximately 6 to 8 weeks post-surgery; however, she alleged that she continued to have chronic—but not quite as severe—stomach issues (including celiac disease and interstitial cystitis) and frequent bathroom needs after the surgery. As a result, Plaintiff alleged that she continued to need her assignment to the slower paced division post-surgery.
Plaintiff complained to the human resources administrator about discriminatory treatment and improper comments in the workplace on two occasions, one time prior to her surgery,1 and another time after she returned to work post-surgery.2 On the second occasion, Plaintiff "discussed her reassignment constituting the withdrawal of the earlier accommodation [*4]  for her disability" and she again raised her complaints about prior discrimination and improper comments in the workplace. Plaintiff alleged that "[r]ather than result in any resolution—or in a restoration of her prior assignment to [a] division which constituted an accommodation—Plaintiff's complaint to [the human resources administrator] resulted in further and even more mistreatment."
On April 5, 2017, Plaintiff was terminated from her position as an ASA by Chief Assistant Basford. The reason that Plaintiff was given for her termination was that she "displayed an unwise use of prosecutorial discretion" and violated an office policy regarding early termination of probation in one of her cases. Plaintiff alleged that this reason was "contrived" because Chief Assistant Basford had previously agreed with Plaintiff's resolution of that case.
In January 2019, Plaintiff sued Defendant in state court. Defendant removed the case to this Court and Plaintiff amended her complaint twice. The now-operative second amended complaint (Doc. 18) contains four counts: Count I alleges a claim for discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 19643 and the Florida Civil Rights Act (FCRA);4 Count [*5]  II alleges a claim for discrimination based on race/national origin under Title VII and the FCRA; Count III alleges a claim for disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)5 and the FCRA; Count IV alleges a claim for retaliation (assumingly) under Title VII, the ADA, and the FCRA. Defendant argues that Counts III and IV are due to be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted.

Analysis
To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The complaint must "contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). To state a plausible claim for relief, a plaintiff must offer "factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Greene v. Ala. Dep't of Revenue, 746 F. App'x 929, 931 (11th Cir. 2018) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.). "[A] complaint asserting employment discrimination need not contain specific facts establishing a prima facie case under the burden-shifting framework . . . Nonetheless, a complaint must allege sufficient facts to allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the employer engaged in discrimination." [*6]  Andrews v. City of Hartford, 700 F. App'x 924, 925-26 (11th Cir. 2017); Gilliam v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51569, 2019 WL 1383156, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 27, 2019) ("Thus, while the failure to plead a particular discrimination element does not mandate dismissal, it can constitute grounds for dismissal where it is apparent that the plaintiff will never be able to carry his burden of proof on that element.").

Disability Discrimination (Count III)
Plaintiff alleges in Count III that Defendant violated the ADA and FCRA by treating her differently than similarly situated non-disabled employees, by refusing to accommodate her disability, and by failing to engage in an interactive process with her regarding potential reasonable accommodations. Defendant argues that these claims are due to be dismissed because (1) "Plaintiff has alleged no facts from which it could be reasonably inferred that she was dismissed because of her disability," Doc. 23, at 4, and (2) "Plaintiff has not alleged that she was denied a reasonable accommodation" because "she did not allege any particular policy or preference of [the judge to whose division she was reassigned] that interfered with her ability to do her job," id. at 5. The Court agrees with Defendant on both points.
With respect to Defendant's first point, in order for Plaintiff to state a claim for disability discrimination, [*7]  she must show that (1) she was disabled, (2) she was a qualified individual, and (3) she suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. See Arrington v. Ala. Power Co., 769 F. App'x 741, 747 (11th Cir. 2019). To establish the third element, Plaintiff is not required to show that her disability was the sole factor for the adverse employment action; rather, she must allege (and ultimately prove) that the disability was the "motivating factor" for the action. See Andrews, 700 F. App'x at 926 (affirming dismissal when plaintiff did not allege facts showing disability was a determinative factor in the termination decision); Booth v. City of Roswell, 754 F. App'x 834, 838 (11th Cir. 2018) (affirming dismissal for failure to allege facts to support allegation that termination was because of disability).
Here, the second amended complaint does not plausibly allege that Plaintiff's stomach condition was a determinative factor in the termination decision. Rather, fairly read, the second amended complaint alleges that the motivating factor for the termination decision was Plaintiff's sexual orientation (not her disability) because Plaintiff alleges that she was fired just a few days after Defendant's "higher ups" learned of her upcoming wedding to her same-sex partner.6
With respect to Defendant's second point, the ADA requires employers [*8]  to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of [its] business." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).7 Failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual is itself considered discrimination, so a plaintiff need not allege discriminatory intent. See Palmer v. McDonald, 624 F. App'x 699, 706 (11th Cir. 2015). An accommodation is reasonable if it allows the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. Spears v. Creel, 607 F. App'x 943, 948 (11th Cir. 2015). Pursuant 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B), a reasonable accommodation may include "reassignment to a vacant position," but whether a certain accommodation is considered reasonable depends on the situation. See Meyer v. Sebelius, 2013 WL 12085986, at *11 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 15, 2013), aff'd sub nom. Meyer v. Sec'y, U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 592 F. App'x 786 (11th Cir. 2014). The removal of an accommodation is also actionable, but not if the prior accommodation exceeded the requirements of the ADA. See id at 12 ("[A]n accommodation that goes beyond the minimum requirements of reasonableness does not prevent the employer from later affording the employee a different reasonable accommodation"); Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1257 n.3 (11th Cir. 2001).
The duty to provide reasonable accommodations is only triggered if the employer knows of the disability, thus, the employee must alert the employer [*9]  of the disability if she is not obviously disabled. Hodgetts v. City of Venice, 794 F. Supp. 2d 1265, 1274 (M.D. Fla. 2011). Also, the plaintiff must allege that she made a specific demand for an accommodation. Avena v. Imperial Salon & Spa, Inc., 740 F. App'x 679, 682 (11th Cir. 2018) (affirming dismissal when the plaintiff failed to allege that she made a specific request); Warren v. Volusia Cty., 188 F. App'x 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2006) ("An employee's failure to request a reasonable accommodation is fatal to the prima facie case."); Anderson v. Werner Enters. Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131537, 2018 WL 3729043, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 6, 2018) (dismissing claim for failure to accommodate when complaint contained no allegation that the plaintiff requested reasonable accommodation).
Here, although Plaintiff alleges that upon her return from surgery, she orally complained to the human resources administrator about "her reassignment constituting the withdrawal of the earlier accommodation for her disability," she does not specifically allege that she requested to be reassigned to the previous division, or any other accommodation. Also, at the time Plaintiff discussed the reassignment with the human resources administrator, it was expected that her stomach issues were to subside 6 to 8 weeks post-surgery and Plaintiff does not allege that she later told the human resources administrator (or anyone else with Defendant) that her symptoms continued and she was still in need of an accommodation. Finally, [*10]  aside from the allegation that the "pace" in the division to which Plaintiff was reassigned "would have been difficult for Plaintiff in her [pre-surgery] condition" (emphasis added), Plaintiff does not allege that she was unable to perform her job duties in that division after the surgery or that the presiding judge in that division refused to accommodate her continued post-surgery needs for bathroom breaks when needed. Thus, Plaintiff has not adequately alleged that the assignment to a slower paced division was an ADA-mandated accommodation that was necessary for her to perform the essential functions of her job.
Accordingly, Count III is due to be dismissed.

Retaliation (Count IV)
Plaintiff alleges in Count IV that Defendant retaliated against her after she complained to the human resources administrator about discriminatory treatment and improper comments in the workplace. Defendant argues that this claim is due to be dismissed because, even if Plaintiff's post-surgery complaint to the human resources administrator constituted protected activity, she "has not sufficiently alleged the causation element of her retaliation claim." See Doc. 23, at 6. Plaintiff responds that Defendant's [*11]  argument overlooks the retaliation that occurred after her first complaint. See Doc. 25, at 12. The Court agrees with both parties.
To state a claim for retaliation under Title VII, the ADA, and/or the FCRA, a "plaintiff must allege that (1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity, (2) he suffered a materially adverse employment action, and (3) a causal relationship between the two events exists." See Palmer, 624 F. App'x at 702 (Title VII); Burgos v. Chertoff, 274 F. App'x 839, 843 (11th Cir. 2008) (ADA); Palm Beach Cty. Sch. Bd. v. Wright, 217 So. 3d 163, 165 (Fla. 4th DCA 2017) (FCRA). The third element can be inferred from the temporal proximity between the first two elements, but without more, the temporal proximity must be "very close." Vinson v. Dep't of Corrs., 2008 WL 11338348, at *4 (N.D. Fla. Sept. 5, 2008) (citing Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 272-73, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001)); see also Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) ("[I]n the absence of other evidence tending to show causation, if there is a substantial delay between the protected expression and the adverse action, the complaint of retaliation fails as a matter of law.")
Here, Plaintiff plausibly alleged that she engaged in statutorily protected activity by complaining to the human resources administrator about discriminatory treatment and improper workplace comments. She also plausibly alleged that she suffered adverse employment actions (1) when she was denied a pay raise and required to keep a portion of her existing caseload after being [*12]  reassigned to a different division post-surgery, and (2) when she was fired. However, aside from the timing of these events, Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged a causal connection between her complaints to the human resources administrator and the adverse employment actions that she suffered. Although there is a close temporal proximity between the first complaint and Plaintiff's reassignment, there is no temporal proximity between either complaint and her termination. Accordingly, insofar as the retaliation claim is based on Plaintiff's termination (rather than her reassignment), it fails to state a claim and is due to be dismissed.

Conclusion
For the reasons stated above, it is ORDERED that Defendant's motion to dismiss (Doc. 23) is GRANTED in part, and:
1. Count III is DISMISSED.
2. Count IV is DISMISSED, except insofar as it alleges that Plaintiff was reassigned to a new division without a pay raise and with her prior caseload in retaliation for her first complaint to the human resources administrator.
DONE and ORDERED this 21st day of November, 2019.
