Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff brings this action alleging discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. ("ADA"). This matter is before the Court upon Defendant's ("Defendant" or "McLeod") Motion for Summary Judgment. (Dkt. No. 35.) Pursuant to the provisions of Title 28, United States Code, Section 636(b)(1) and Local Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g), D.S.C., all pretrial matters in employment discrimination cases are referred to a United States Magistrate Judge for consideration. For the reasons set forth herein, the undersigned recommends that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 35) be granted.

BACKGROUND
In January 2015, Defendant hired Plaintiff as a paramedic on its EMS transport vehicle. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 45:9-21.) As a paramedic, Plaintiff worked in close cooperation with the fire department [*2]  and local law enforcement. (Id. at 79:19-23.) When responding to a call, the fire department generally controlled the physical scene itself (with one individual serving as "fire command"), while the EMS team was responsible for the patient(s). (Id. at 81:16-82:10.) As a result, Plaintiff's ability to work cohesively with the other emergency responders was critical. (Id. at 78:17-23.)
In January 2016, Defendant promoted Plaintiff to the position of transport coordinator, which involved supervising as many as twenty EMS employees. (Id. 48:2-8, 49:13-17.) Plaintiff continued, however, to assist with calls and provide emergency medical care when needed. One such call occurred on August 10, 2017. Plaintiff was at Defendant's headquarters when he received a dispatch call alerting the EMS team to a motor vehicle accident. (Id. at 89:19-90:20.) Plaintiff drove to the scene in a Quick Response Vehicle ("QRV"), while two paramedics, Stephanie Hughes1 ("Hughes") and Angel McClary ("McClary"), responded to the call in an ambulance ("Medic 1"). (Id. at 90:21-91:24.) Two other paramedics, Chancely Coker ("Coker") and Stephanie Hipp ("Hipp"), subsequently responded to the call ("Medic 2"). (Dkt. No. [*3]  35-3 at 29-31.) The Clarendon County Fire Department ("CCFD" or the "Fire Department") was already on the scene when Plaintiff and the other paramedics arrived. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 92:4-11.)
The accident involved a collision between a passenger vehicle and a log truck carrying large pine trees. The truck's trailer had overturned onto the passenger vehicle, such that the vehicle and its driver were trapped beneath the weight of the truck and the unsecured logs that had shifted during the collision. (Dkt. No. 35-3 at 14, 27, 29, 33-34; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 97:11-25.) After conducting a brief assessment of the scene, Hughes (Medic 1), reported to Plaintiff that the truck driver was fine, but the driver of the passenger vehicle had sustained "an injury incompatible with life," meaning that death was imminent and the goal was "recovery," rather than "rescue."2 (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 94:16-95:14; Dkt. No. 38-1 at 54-55.) Upon consulting the firefighters on the scene, however, Plaintiff was informed that the driver was still breathing and had responded to "verbal stimuli." (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 96:7-24; Dkt. No. 35-3 at 21.) Plaintiff therefore proceeded with emergency medical care in an attempt to rescue [*4]  the patient. (Dkt. No. 38-1 at 14, 16-17.)
Because the driver was trapped beneath the logs, Plaintiff had to climb through a narrow gap under the overturned truck to access the patient. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 97:1-10.) Jessica Weinberg ("Weinberg"), one of the CCFD firefighters on scene, crawled under the truck to help Plaintiff administer the necessary medical care. (Dkt. No. 38-1 at 15.) When Plaintiff reached the driver, he was nonresponsive and had "copious amounts of blood in and around his mouth." (Id. at 14.) Coker (Medic 2) slid the necessary medical tools under the truck so that Plaintiff could suction the patient's mouth, open his airways, and provide additional oxygen through a non-rebreather mask. (Id. at 15.) Plaintiff instructed Hughes (Medic 1) to arrange emergency helicopter transport. (Id. at 54-55.)
Two wrecker tow trucks eventually arrived on the scene to begin lifting the logs off the vehicle. (Id. at 16.) The Fire Department directed Plaintiff to get out from under the truck so that the wreckers could begin the extrication process. Plaintiff requested several more minutes to finish treating the patient, after which he and Weinberg crawled out. (Id. at 16-17.) Plaintiff became concerned, however, by the Fire Department's [*5]  apparent lack of strategy in moving the logs. Plaintiff claims that he approached Ed Gamble3 ("Gamble"), CCFD Captain, and warned him that the unsteady logs could crush the vehicle and its driver: "We can't just be yanking these logs off or we're going to . . . kill this patient as it is. He's already critical. If you don't have a plan to remove the logs, . . . you're just going to kill the guy." (Id. at 18.) Plaintiff proceeded to instruct the Fire Department on the best way to remove the logs to avoid harming the patient. Plaintiff acknowledges that the Fire Department probably did not welcome his suggestions. (Id. at 18-19, 66; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 146:8-17.)
As the wreckers continued to maneuver the logs, Plaintiff repeatedly went back to the trapped vehicle so that he could check on the patient and administer further care. (Dkt. No. 38-1 at 19; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 146:18-147:6.) By this point in the day, Plaintiff claims that the emergency responders were "extremely hot," "overheated," and "dehydrated," and that the scene had become "very intense." (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 84:9-15; Dkt. No. 38-1 at 24-25, 66.) So when EMS personnel on site urged Plaintiff to "step back" from the unsafe work area while the wreckers were [*6]  trying to clear the logs, Plaintiff snapped something along the lines of, "let me do my job," and "I got this, leave me alone." (Dkt. No. 38-1 at 24-25, 66.)
Tension had also developed between Plaintiff and the Fire Department. According to CCFD Captain Gamble, upon seeing Plaintiff "climbing over some of the remaining unsecured logs and positioning himself between one of the logs and the vehicle," he called out to Plaintiff to "get out of there." (Id. at 19-20, 62.) When Plaintiff finally returned to the safe zone, Gamble claims that he told Plaintiff it was no longer safe to work on the patient while the wreckers were trying to maneuver the logs off the vehicle and that "no one was going back in there until it was safe." (Id. at 62.) Plaintiff claims that he never heard Captain Gamble yelling to "get out" from under the truck—although Plaintiff admits that Gamble may have—and denies that Gamble ever told him to stop entering the work zone while the wreckers were removing the logs. To the contrary, Plaintiff claims that Gamble had given him permission to continue checking on the patient during the extrication process. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 152:10-153:1, 153:16-154:2.) Nevertheless, Plaintiff acknowledges that [*7]  the two men ended up exchanging "stress-related" words, during which Plaintiff recalled telling Gamble that he had "36 years of experience" and knew how to do his job. (Id. at 84:18-85:2,148:21-149:14; Dkt. No. 38-1 at 25-26, 62.) Plaintiff acknowledges that as fire command, Gamble had the authority to make determinations regarding the safety of the scene, and that any insubordination would have been considered "breaking the chain of command." (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 153:5-15.) Plaintiff later apologized to Gamble, telling him that he "was sorry that [they] might have had a different approach to this." (Id. at 155:5-12; Dkt. No. 38-1 at 62, 66.) The patient ultimately died at the scene of the accident. (Dkt. No. 38-1 at 20.)
Later that evening, Plaintiff called his supervisor Brad Gerfin ("Gerfin") and told him that the EMS team had "a bad call that turned into a fatality," and that there had been "a little friction" between Plaintiff and the Fire Department during the response efforts. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 116:17-117:7; Dkt. No. 35-3 at 23.) Plaintiff cautioned Gerfin that he "may be hearing about it" from CCFD because Plaintiff had "exchanged words" with the fire command, Captain Gamble. (Dkt. [*8]  No. 35-4 at 20:18-21:3; Dkt. No. 35-3 at 23; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 117:21-25, 123:18-21.) Plaintiff also told Gerfin that he thought the Fire Department may be upset because "nobody likes to have their toes stepped on," and the firefighters likely felt that Plaintiff had "jumped into their . . . portion of it." (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 117:8-20, 123:9-17.)
The next morning, Friday, August 11, 2017, Plaintiff sent Gerfin a text message stating, "Think I need today off. That okay." (Id. at 123:22-124:2.) When Plaintiff did not hear back, he went into work and asked to meet with Gerfin in-person. (Id. at 124:3-13; Dkt. No. 35-3 at 23.) During the meeting, Plaintiff became "very emotional" and broke down crying, telling Gerfin that he could not sleep because "he could still see the man's face" from the day prior, and that he could not bear to see another person die. (Dkt. No. 35-3 at 23; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 119:1-14, 119:25-120:2, 124:14-125:1.) Plaintiff told Gerfin that he was thinking about all the senseless killings he had witnessed throughout his years of service and that he could not do the job anymore. (Dkt. No. 35-3 at 23; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 120:3-121:5.) Gerfin advised Plaintiff to go home and [*9]  take the rest of the day off. (Dkt. No. 35-4 at 22:5-19; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 121:6-8.) Gerfin texted Plaintiff later that day to make sure he was okay; Plaintiff responded that he was alright and was going to hit some golf balls. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 121:9-17, 125:2-126:8.) At some point that same afternoon, Gerfin was informed by one of the paramedics working the August 10th call that "things got very bad out on that scene and [he] may want to . . . check into it."4 (Dkt. No. 35-4 at 23:8-24:3.) Based on this information—and in light of Plaintiff's statements regarding the tension between him and CCFD during the call—Gerfin decided that this was "something [Defendant] needed to look into further." (Id. at 27:4-28:1.)
On Monday, August 14, 2017, Plaintiff returned to work and again met with Gerfin. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 126:9-11.) During this meeting, Gerfin informed Plaintiff that he had initiated an investigation into Plaintiff's conduct during the August 10th call. (Id. at 129:17-130:11.) Gerfin also told Plaintiff that he was concerned for his mental health and wellbeing; Plaintiff was still visibly upset by the call and had been experiencing "incredibly severe" emotional problems since the [*10]  night of the accident. (Id. at 168:19-169:13; Dkt. No. 38 at 26.) Accordingly, Gerfin informed Plaintiff that he was formally referring him to the Employee Assistance Program ("EAP") in an effort to provide professional help. (Dkt. No. 38-1 at 36; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 126:12-14, 168:22-25.)
Gerfin then reviewed the EAP Supervisor Referral form with Plaintiff. Under the "comments" section, Gerfin wrote: "Mr. Sanders has had a long career in the fire services and EMS. He responded to a difficult call, [and] the patient ended up dying on scene. He is having emotional issues following this call." (Dkt. No. 35-3 at 24.) Gerfin further noted that, "This call has brought about a strong emotional response and depression for Mr. Sanders. He stated to me, 'I don't think I can do this job anymore.'" (Id. at 25.) The referral form also notified the EAP of the ongoing investigation into Plaintiff's conduct during the August 10th call. Gerfin wrote, "Mr. Sanders placed himself in great danger, he interacted poorly with other agencies and created problems at the scene. Information is still being gathered and no disciplinary actions have been determined." (Id.) Plaintiff signed the referral form, indicating that [*11]  he read and understood the statements therein. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 129:17-130:11.)
The next day, Gerfin placed Plaintiff on paid administrative leave pending the results of the investigation at the direction of Defendant's Director of Human Resources, Gail Richburg ("Richburg"). (Dkt. No. 35-4 at 26:19-27:6; Dkt. No. 35-5 at 16:3-8; Dkt. No. 35-3 at 26; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 131:13-20.) Gerfin "reached out to the crews" involved in the August 10th call and requested "written statements" describing their versions of "what had happened on the scene." (Dkt. No. 35-4 at 26:11-27:6; Dkt. No. 35-6 ¶ 3.) He also contacted CCFD seeking "statements from anyone who had issues" during the August 10th call. (Dkt. No. 35-4 at 28:3-16.) Hughes (Dkt. No. 38-1 at 53-55), Coker (id. at 56-60), Gamble (id. at 61-62), and Weinberg (id. at 63-64) each provided a statement, which are summarized below:

Stephanie Hughes (Medic 1)
According to Hughes, the patient at the August 10th call had indeed sustained injuries incompatible with life, such that she felt the risk of sending EMS personnel underneath the overturned truck was too high given the circumstances. (Dkt. No. 38-1 at 54.) Despite these safety concerns, Plaintiff nevertheless insisted on crawling [*12]  into the unstable, dangerous space underneath the truck, which "could have collapsed at any time." (Id. at 54-55.) Hughes claimed that once the wreckers arrived, one of the firefighters told her that Plaintiff needed to get out from under the truck so that they could start lifting the logs off the vehicle; when Hughes relayed this information to Plaintiff, he refused to acknowledge her until finally she screamed, "Sanders get out from under the truck now, they cannot move these logs until you get out!" (Id. at 55.)
According to Hughes, Plaintiff continued to go back into to the unsafe zone during the extrication process and, after urging him to back up multiple times, Plaintiff shouted at her, "Get away from me, I mean it!" (Id.) And, "I have been a firefighter for over 30 years, I got to tell them what order to move the logs!" (Id.) Hughes concluded her statement by noting that Plaintiff had failed to focus on the big picture that day and had acted "with total disregard for his own safety and the safety of other emergency personnel on scene." (Id.)

Chancely Coker (Medic 2)
Similar to Hughes, Coker stated that Plaintiff had ignored repeated requests to get out from under the unstable truck throughout the [*13]  course of the August 10th call, which forced CCFD firefighters to remain in the dangerous space with him. (Id. at 58-59.) Coker claimed that once the wreckers arrived, Plaintiff "appeared to be attempting to direct the Fire Department in the extrication of the patient. It is my understanding that the Fire Department did not request his assistance in the actual extrication of the patient and that the manner in which he was providing instruction was not welcome." (Id. at 58.) Coker further noted that Plaintiff "repeatedly returned to the working area in which the logs were being actively removed via heavy tow truck. This area was unsafe to be in and [Plaintiff's] presence appeared to be causing conflict and delay in extraction." (Id.) Coker wrote that she later witnessed an exchange between Plaintiff and Captain Gamble, during which Plaintiff got "very close to Ed Gamble's face" and yelled, "I have 36 . . . years of experience and I know how to do my job." (Id.) Coker stated that "the Fire Department appeared to be handling the situation very professionally," but "it was obvious . . . that tensions were very high amongst most if not all responders on scene." (Id. at 58.)

Ed Gamble (CCFD Captain)
According to Gamble's [*14]  statement, the patient at the August 10th call had a pulse and was responding to stimuli when the Fire Department made its initial assessment. (Id. at 62.) The Fire Department positioned large wreckers on each side of the trapped vehicle to begin removing the logs and extricating the patient. The wreckers had removed three of the logs when Gamble noticed Plaintiff working in the extrication area. (Id.) Gambled claimed that he called out to Plaintiff to get away from the vehicle, but Plaintiff did not acknowledge his instructions. Gamble wrote that once Plaintiff was back in the safe area,
I told him the area where the patient was located was not safe and that no one was going back in there until it was safe. [Plaintiff] stated "he was doing patient assessment and he would be going back in as often as needed." I again told him the area was not safe and that he was not to go back in until it was rendered safe. He then turned and was face to face with me and told me he had "36 years of fire experience." I told him I had 40 years of fire experience but that had nothing to do with this. The scene was not safe, I was Command, and that no one was going back in until it was safe.
(Id.) Gamble noted that [*15]  Plaintiff later "apologized for his actions." (Id.) Gamble told Plaintiff he "was sorry it happened, but it did not change my position or what I had to say to him." (Id.)

Jessica Weinberg (CCFD Firefighter)
According to Weinberg, the patient at the August 10th call "had a pulse, was breathing, and responded to voice with moans." (Id. at 64.) Plaintiff was able to make access to the patient and administer medical care. (Id.) Once the wreckers arrived on scene, however, the Fire Department directed all responders to move away from the trapped vehicle so that the trucks could begin stabilizing the logs. (Id.) Weinberg claimed that the Fire Department had to make several "desperate" requests before Plaintiff finally agreed to get out from under the truck. (Id.) According to Weinberg, Plaintiff continued to return to the restricted area as the tow trucks attempted to remove the logs. At this point, "several logs were still on the trailer and needed to be secured by the wrecker service before any personnel entered the area. This need was clear between the wrecker service and Fire Department Command. The Fire Department Command (Ed Gamble) called out to [Plaintiff] as he was entering the area to advise [*16]  him that it was not safe. . . ." (Id.) Weinberg claimed that Plaintiff approached Gamble "in a very unprofessional manner, advising him that he was EMS command and that he was going to check on his patient." (Id.) Weinberg concluded her statement by noting that "[s]afety of all responders was the priority at this scene. This was compromised several times by the actions of [Plaintiff]." (Id.)

Plaintiff's Trip Report
In addition to these four witness statements, Gerfin also obtained a Trip Report completed by Plaintiff, which detailed the August 10th call from his perspective. (Id. at 66.) The Trip Report noted that when the wreckers arrived on scene, the Fire Department directed Plaintiff to get out from under the truck, and that he did so after requesting several more minutes to finish treating the patient. (Id.) Plaintiff wrote that at some point during the extrication process, "[a] member of the fire department command came up to me and told me I needed to move for safety reasons. I said I understand but I am assisting them in removing logs in the best way possible. He asked if I would just step back a little more as he didn't want anybody to get hurt, which I did. . . ." (Id.) Plaintiff further [*17]  suggested that he had permission to continue checking on the patient as the wreckers removed the logs and created easier access to the trapped vehicle. The Trip Report stated that while Plaintiff was in the process of administering such care, Hughes asked him to step back and take a break for a few minutes. "I told her at this point to please let me continue to treat the patient[,] that I did not want anyone else under the logs except myself." (Id.) The Trip Report confirmed that, at the end of the call, Plaintiff "apologize[d] to command as the scene was very intense." (Id.)
Upon reviewing these written statements, Gerfin concluded that Plaintiff "had engaged in unprofessional conduct, put his own safety in jeopardy, put the safety of others in jeopardy, and delayed the operation at the accident scene on August 10, 2017." (Dkt. No. 35-6 ¶ 10.) Gerfin found that Plaintiff's "behavior at the scene, as four people at the scene consistently reported to [him], was entirely unacceptable and mandated the termination of his employment." (Id. ¶ 11.) On August 18, 2017, Gerfin and Richburg met with Plaintiff and informed him that his employment was being terminated based on his "unprofessional" [*18]  conduct during the August 10th call. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 83:3-84:4, 165:16-166:21; Dkt. No. 38-1 at 51.) During this meeting, Plaintiff received a Performance Expectation Process Worksheet, which stated that he was being dismissed for "[u]nprofessional behavior at scene of accident on August 10, 2017." (Dkt. No. 35-3 at 35.) Plaintiff initialed the form. (Id.; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 167:1-168:10.) Although Plaintiff was "floored" by the termination decision, (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 84:5-8), he acknowledges that Gerfin generally was a fair supervisor and that he had no reason to believe Gerfin possessed an intent to discriminate against him based on disability (id. at 51:13-18).
On April 9, 2018, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant in the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas, Clarendon County, alleging that Defendant unlawfully terminated his employment on the basis of his disability—specifically, post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD") resulting from the August 10th call—and failed to accommodate said disability in violation of the ADA.5 (Dkt. No. 1-1.) On September 27, 2019, Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking dismissal of Plaintiff's Complaint in its entirety. (Dkt. No. [*19]  35.) Plaintiff filed a Response in Opposition on October 28, 2019, (Dkt. No. 38), and Defendant filed its reply on November 4, 2019, (Dkt. No. 39).

LEGAL STANDARD
Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment "shall" be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "Facts are 'material' when they might affect the outcome of the case, and a 'genuine issue' exists when the evidence would allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party." The News & Observer Publ'g Co. v. Raleigh-Durham Airport Auth., 597 F.3d 570, 576 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, "the nonmoving party's evidence is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in that party's favor." See Id. (quoting Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 552, 119 S. Ct. 1545, 143 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1999)); see also Perini Corp. v. Perini Constr., Inc., 915 F.2d 121, 123-24 (4th Cir. 1990). However, "the nonmoving party must rely on more than conclusory allegations, mere speculation, the building of one inference upon another, or the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." Dash v. Mayweather, 731 F.3d 303, 311 (4th Cir. 2013).

DISCUSSION

I. Discriminatory Discharge
The ADA makes it unlawful for an employer to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee [*20]  compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Absent direct evidence, disability discrimination is established pursuant to the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework.6 See Gomez v. Haystax Tech., Inc., 292 F. Supp. 3d 676, 685 (E.D. Va. 2017), aff'd, 761 F. App'x 220 (4th Cir. 2019) (referencing McDonnell Douglas Corp v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)).
Under the McDonnell Douglas paradigm, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie claim of disability discrimination under the ADA. The plaintiff must show that: (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability as defined by the ADA; (2) he was discharged; (3) at the time of discharge, he was performing his job at a level that met his employer's legitimate expectations; and (4) the alleged adverse action occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., 252 F.3d 696, 702 (4th Cir. 2001). If the plaintiff can set forth each of these elements, the defendant must "show a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for its actions. Gomez, 292 F. Supp. 3d at 683. The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff "to show that the employer's proffered reason for taking an adverse employment action is actually a pretext for discrimination." Id. at 683-85.
"Notwithstanding the intricacies of proof schemes, the core of every [discrimination] case remains the [*21]  same, necessitating resolution of the ultimate question of . . . whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination." See Brown v. City of Columbia, No. 3:10-CV-2860-JFA-PJG, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125864, 2012 WL 3835389, at *3 (D.S.C. July 19, 2012), adopted, No. 3:10-CV-2860-JFA, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124969, 2012 WL 3838109 (D.S.C. Sept. 4, 2012) (citing Merritt v. Old Dominion Freight, 601 F.3d 289, 294-95 (4th Cir. 2010)). "The ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff." Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). Plaintiff fails to meet that burden in the instant case.
As a threshold matter, Plaintiff cannot establish the first or third prongs of his prima facie claim of disability discrimination. To satisfy the first prong, Plaintiff must demonstrate that he is a "qualified individual" for purposes of the ADA. The term qualified individual means "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.'" 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); Allen v. ACS Techs. Grp., Inc., No. 4:18-CV-631-DCC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163061, 2019 WL 4622091, at *3 (D.S.C. Sept. 24, 2019). Accordingly, if the record reveals that the plaintiff "was unable to work in any capacity" at the time of his termination, he is not a "qualified individual" under the ADA. Davis v. Med. Univ. of S.C.-Physicians, MUSC-P, No. 2:14-CV-03152-MGB, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41045, 2016 WL 1221909, at *12 (D.S.C. Mar. 29, 2016), aff'd, 668 F. App'x 532 (4th Cir. 2016).
In the [*22]  instant case, Plaintiff expressly acknowledged that his PTSD—which was triggered the night of August 10, 2017—rendered him entirely unable to work. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 168:17-169:16, 205:11-19, 206:19-207:5.) Indeed, Plaintiff testified that, "[s]tarting that night and the next day, I was having some incredibly severe . . . emotional problems that were . . . because of the call." (Id. at 168:19-21.) "I was having anxiety, depression, [and] panic attacks at this time," and "[e]verybody knew I was having a crisis, that I . . . couldn't stay around." (Id. at 169:2-13.) Most notably, Plaintiff notified Gerfin on the morning of August 11, 2017, that "he didn't think he could do the job anymore." (Dkt. No. 35-3 at 23-25.)
To be sure, Plaintiff testified during his deposition, almost two (2) years after the August 10th call, that his PTSD and anxiety still prevented him from working in a capacity similar to his job with McLeod: "There's no way I could—it scares me to think that I could treat a patient right now because I have zero confidence. . . . I don't even like to hear the ambulance and the sirens come by. It makes me very anxious. I can't be around people." (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 206:13-208:4.) [*23]  Thus, by Plaintiff's own admissions, he was unable to continue performing the essential functions of his job following the log truck accident.7
Moreover, as Defendant correctly notes, Plaintiff also acknowledged that he received disability benefits from the government based on his PTSD. (Id. at 205:2-206:5.) And while filing for disability benefits "does not necessarily preclude a court from finding that a terminated employee was able to fulfill their occupational duties" at the time of termination, "an ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier [] total disability claim. Rather, [he] must proffer a sufficient explanation." See Hamilton v. Dayco Prods., LLC, No. 2:07-CV-2782-PMD-RSC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10545, 2009 WL 335062, at *5 (D.S.C. Feb. 10, 2009) (citing Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 805-06, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999)); see also Allen, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163061, 2019 WL 4622091, at *4 (D.S.C. Sept. 24, 2019) (dismissing ADA claim where plaintiff "presented no evidence attempting to reconcile his [long-term disability] application with his ADA claim").
Here, Plaintiff does not directly reconcile his disability benefits with his ADA claim; instead, he argues that had Defendant allowed him to continue participating in the EAP, his condition would have improved and eventually he would have been able to perform the essential functions of his [*24]  job. (Dkt. No. 38 at 21-22.) Other than Plaintiff's bare speculation, however, there is no objective evidence in the record suggesting that Plaintiff's participation in the EAP would have alleviated his PTSD symptoms to the point where he could have returned to his position. See Peltier v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., No. 2:00-CV-01726-DCN-WWD, 2001 WL 34681748, at *4 (D.S.C. Aug. 6, 2001), aff'd, 25 F. App'x 182 (4th Cir. 2002) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that his "medical diagnosis would not be as severe as it is today" had he received a reasonable accommodation at the time of his mental breakdown because plaintiff failed to present "any evidence, much less any expert medical evidence" to support his assertion); see also Dash, 731 F.3d at 311 (noting that the nonmoving party must rely on more than speculation); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249 ("If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted."). Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to establish that he is a "qualified individual" as required under the first prong of his prima facie claim.
With respect to the third prong of his prima facie claim, Plaintiff must demonstrate that he was performing his job duties at a level that met Defendant's legitimate expectations at the time of his discharge. See Dinda v. CSC Gov't Sols., LLC, No. 2:17-CV-03171-DCN-MGB, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121052, 2019 WL 4280370, at *7 (D.S.C. Mar. 21, 2019), [*25]  adopted, No. 2:17-CV-03171-DCN, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120423, 2019 WL 3244186 (D.S.C. July 19, 2019) (referencing Miles v. Dell, Inc., 429 F.3d 480, 485 (4th Cir. 2005)). In evaluating satisfactory job performance, it is well-established that the self-assessment of the plaintiff is irrelevant to the analysis. See, e.g., King v. Rumsfeld, 328 F.3d 145, 149 (4th Cir. 2003); Stevens v. Del Webb Cmtys., Inc., 456 F. Supp. 2d 698, 729-30 (D.S.C. 2006). Instead, the court must look to the perception of the decisionmaker. Dinda, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121052, 2019 WL 4280370, at *7; King, 328 F.3d at 149. The term "legitimate" means that expectations cannot be a "sham designed to hide the employer's discriminatory purpose." Addison v. CMH Homes, Inc., 47 F. Supp. 3d 404, 419-22 (D.S.C. 2014) (internal citations omitted).
As part of Defendant's EMS team, Plaintiff was expected to work "in close cooperation" with the Fire Department and "to protect [his] own safety and the safety of the other responders" in responding to the scene of an accident. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 79:19-21, 107:12-17.) As a McLeod employee, Plaintiff was also expected to comply with Defendant's Performance Expectation Process policy, which required employees to act professionally, courteously, and safely. (Id. at 65:3-66:25.) Thus, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's "actions at the August 10, 2017 accident scene"—which were corroborated by four consistent eyewitness statements—demonstrate that he was not fulfilling the aforementioned expectations at the time of his discharge. (Dkt. No. 35-1 [*26]  at 21-22.)
In response, Plaintiff contests the underlying facts of the August 10th call and argues that the eyewitness statements on which Defendant relies are inaccurate and overblown. For example, while Plaintiff acknowledges "there was a confrontation between [him] and Gamble," during the August 10th response efforts, he asserts that the confrontation "was nowhere near as intense as [Hughes, McClary, and Weinberg] claim." (Dkt. No. 38 at 24.) Plaintiff further argues that his actions were not "unsafe" or "fruitless" as characterized by the witness statements; rather, Plaintiff suggests that his conduct was justified because the driver of the trapped vehicle was still breathing when Plaintiff arrived on scene and, thus, he had "an obligation" to do whatever he could to rescue the patient. (Id. at 7-11, 23-26.)
As stated above, however, while Plaintiff may disagree with the way in which the four witnesses described the events from August 10, 2017, it is the perception of the decisionmaker—not Plaintiff—that determines whether he was satisfying Defendant's legitimate expectations at the time of his discharge. Dinda, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121052, 2019 WL 4280370, at *7; King, 328 F.3d at 149. And here, even Plaintiff admits that any EMS supervisor who receives four witness statements [*27]  alleging unsafe, unprofessional conduct at the scene of an accident should have cause for concern. (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 87:11-22.) Indeed, Plaintiff agreed that it would be "very problematic" if "[an] employee was engaging in those types of behaviors," and that a supervisor should take such reports seriously. (Id. at 87:8-15, 156:5-11.) Gerfin did just that.
After consulting the witness statements and Plaintiff's Trip Report, Gerfin determined that Plaintiff had "put his safety . . . and the safety of others in jeopardy" during the August 10th call, and that such "unprofessional behavior" warranted termination of employment. (Dkt. No. 35-4 at 68:4-19; Dkt. No. 35-3 at 35.) This evidence is more than enough to demonstrate that Plaintiff was not satisfying Defendant's legitimate job expectations at the time of his discharge. See, e.g., Odom v. Int'l Paper Co., 652 F. Supp. 2d 671, 690-91 (E.D. Va. 2009), aff'd, 381 Fed. Appx. 246 (4th Cir. 2010) (finding that plaintiff's safety violations were not consistent with employer's legitimate expectations for his performance, even though plaintiff felt his actions were permissible); Nana-Akua Takyiwaa Shalom v. Payless Shoesource Worldwide, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 2d 470, 485 (D. Md. 2013) (concluding that plaintiff was not satisfying her employer's legitimate expectations where she failed to follow established policies and exhibited a confrontational, [*28]  hostile attitude). Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot satisfy the third prong of his prima facie claim.
However, even assuming arguendo that Plaintiff could somehow establish these prima facie elements of his disability discrimination claim, the undersigned agrees with McLeod that Plaintiff still fails to carry the "ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against [him]." Lawrence v. Veolia Transp. Servs., No. 2:07-CV-2722-MBS, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28589, 2009 WL 857394, at *5 (D.S.C. Mar. 30, 2009); see also Hatcher v. Wilkie, No. 3:17-CV-2535-JMC-PJG, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57468, 2019 WL 2090810, at *3 (D.S.C. Feb. 27, 2019) ("Accordingly, the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating pretext merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that [the plaintiff] has been the victim of intentional discrimination.") (internal citations omitted).
At the outset, the undersigned notes that any evidence of discrimination is seriously undermined by Plaintiff's own admissions that Gerfin was a fair, compassionate supervisor, and that he had no reason to believe Gerfin "possessed an intent to discriminate against [him] based on disability." (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 51:13-18, 122:8-11.) To the contrary, Plaintiff surmised that "politics" probably influenced his discharge. (Id. at 52:20-23.) Notwithstanding [*29]  these fatal admissions, Plaintiff still argues that Defendant terminated his employment based on disability, and that McLeod's proffered reason—that Plaintiff engaged in unprofessional, unsafe conduct during the August 10th call—is pretextual.8 More specifically, Plaintiff contends that Gerfin's investigation was subpar and failed to reconcile purported "inconsistencies" within the witness reports (e.g., whether the August 10th call was a "rescue" mission or a "recovery" mission). According to Plaintiff, Gerfin's failure to resolve these alleged inconsistencies demonstrates that "McLeod did not care what the facts actually were; they simply wanted to fire [Plaintiff] as quickly as they could after they learned he was suffering from PTSD." (Dkt. No. 38 at 25-26.) Plaintiff's argument fails for several reasons.
First, as Defendant aptly notes, "[t]he alleged 'discrepancies' between the various narratives involve immaterial facts." (Dkt. No. 39 at 13.) Indeed, none of Plaintiff's allegations change the undisputed fact that four credible emergency responders consistently reported that Plaintiff had a confrontation with the CCFD Captain during the August 10th call, jeopardized his own [*30]  safety and the safety of other responders on the scene, and acted in an unprofessional manner. (Dkt. No. 38-1 at 53-64; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 86:16-87:10, 162:13-23.) It is also undisputed that such reports, if true, would be "very concerning" to an EMS supervisor like Gerfin.9 (See Dkt. No. 35-2 at 155:18-156:11, agreeing that it would be very concerning for a supervisor to receive a report like the one submitted by Captain Gamble, and that the supervisor would have to take the accusations "very seriously").
Moreover, even if the witness statements contained certain inaccuracies as Plaintiff suggests, Plaintiff must show that the McLeod decision-makers did not genuinely believe the reasons behind their actions. See Holland v. Washington Homes, Inc., 487 F.3d 208, 217-18 (4th Cir. 2007) (finding that no reasonable juror could conclude the decision-maker's reason was pretextual where plaintiff's evidence failed to address whether decision-maker "did not honestly believe" that plaintiff engaged in the alleged misconduct); Addison, 47 F. Supp. 3d at 420 (finding that even if defendant relied on unfair or inaccurate information in terminating plaintiff's employment, plaintiff still failed to demonstrate that defendant did not genuinely believe plaintiff failed to meet company's legitimate expectations [*31]  at the time of discharge).
Based on the record before the Court, there is no evidence to suggest that Gerfin did not genuinely believe Plaintiff engaged in the unprofessional, unsafe behavior alleged by Hughes, Coker, Weinberg, and Gamble. To the contrary, Gerfin testified that he had no reason to believe that any of the witnesses fabricated their accounts of the August 10th call, nor did he have any reason to question their credibility. (Dkt. No. 35-4 at 66:22-67:11.) Furthermore, Plaintiff himself corroborated the witness reports when he called Gerfin the night of the accident and told him that there had been "friction" between him and the Fire Department, and that he had "exchanged words" with Captain Gamble. (Dkt. No. 35-4 at 20:18-21:3; Dkt. No. 35-2 at 116:17-117:7, 123:18-21; Dkt. No. 35-3 at 23.) Massey v. New Hope Carolinas, Inc., No. 0:12-CV-735-JFA-PJG, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187008, 2012 WL 7785070, at *3 (D.S.C. Nov. 21, 2012), adopted, No. 0:12-CV-735-JFA, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38555, 2013 WL 1187144 (D.S.C. Mar. 20, 2013) (dismissing discrimination claim where plaintiff presented no evidence tending to show that defendant did not believe its stated reason for firing her to be true); see also Odom, 652 F. Supp. 2d at 687 (emphasizing that alleged mistakes of fact from an investigation do not show that defendant's stated reasons for discipline were false [*32]  or discriminatory).
While Plaintiff may disagree with Gerfin's assessment of the evidence surrounding the August 10th call, Plaintiff's contentions regarding the veracity of Gerfin's investigation and the fairness of his termination are not relevant to the pretext inquiry. Indeed, "an employer's failure to adhere to common notions of fairness in the termination process is not probative of discriminatory intent and cannot show pretext." Addison, 47 F. Supp. 3d at 421; see also Duggan v. Sisters of Charity Providence Hosps., 663 F. Supp. 2d 456, 470 n.6 (D.S.C. 2009) (rejecting plaintiff's attempt to establish pretext by pointing out that the defendant rushed to judgment to terminate him and failed to interview witnesses or the plaintiff himself). Federal discrimination statutes are not vehicles for "substituting the judgment of a court for that of the employer." Thompson v. Rock Hill Sch. Dist. III, No. 0:13-CV-01889-JFA, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150857, 2014 WL 5369775, at *12 (D.S.C. Oct. 22, 2014); see also Malghan v. Evans, 118 F. App'x. 731 (4th Cir. 2004) ("[T]he law does not require an employer to make, in the first instance, employment choices that are wise, rational, or even well-considered, as long as they are nondiscriminatory.")
Thus, it is not this Court's place to decide whether Gerfin's reasoning "was wise, fair, or even correct, ultimately, so long as it truly was the reason for [Plaintiff's] termination." Hawkins v. Pepsico, 203 F.3d 274, 279 (4th Cir. 2000) (citing DeJarnette v. Corning, Inc., 133 F.3d 293, 299 (4th Cir. 1998)). Based [*33]  on the record before the Court, the undersigned finds that there is insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff's unprofessional behavior during the August 10th call was not the true reason for his discharge. Because Plaintiff has failed to establish intentional disability discrimination, the undersigned recommends that the Court grant Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 35) as to Plaintiff's discharge claim. See Addison, 47 F. Supp. 3d at 417 (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (explaining that "'if the record conclusively reveal[s] some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if the plaintiff create[s] only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred,' summary judgment is appropriate").

II. Failure to Accommodate
The ADA requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity. [*34]  . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the ADA, the plaintiff must show that (1) he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute, (2) his employer had notice of his disability, (3) he could perform the essential functions of the position with a reasonable accommodation, and (4) his employer refused to make such accommodations. See Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013).
Here, Plaintiff claims that Defendant "refused" to accommodate his disability because the termination of his employment automatically ended his "EAP assistance." (Dkt. No. 38 at 20.) Plaintiff's claim fails for several reasons. First, as discussed above, Plaintiff is not considered a "qualified individual" for purposes of the ADA. Indeed, Plaintiff expressly acknowledged that his PTSD and anxiety rendered him entirely unable to work, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that continued EAP assistance would have changed the severity of his condition or enabled him to retain his job with Defendant. To be sure, Plaintiff admitted during his deposition that despite receiving counseling and medication for his condition, he was still unable to return to the emergency response field. (Dkt. No. [*35]  35-2 at 206:6-208:4.) Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine question of material fact as to whether a reasonable accommodation (specifically, continued participation in the EAP) would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his former position.
More importantly, however, there is no evidence that Defendant actually denied Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation. To the contrary, Gerfin took it upon himself to initiate the EAP referral process on Plaintiff's behalf in an effort to "get him some help" following the August 10th call. (Dkt. No. 35-4 at 22:5-23, 25:6-24.) Even Plaintiff admits that Gerfin referred him to the EAP because he was concerned for Plaintiff's wellbeing and "was trying to help." (Dkt. No. 35-2 at 122:4-16, 168:19-169:6.) Nevertheless, McLeod was under no obligation to excuse Plaintiff's behavior from the August 10th call so that he could continue his employment and retain access to the EAP. As Defendant properly notes, "in the Fourth Circuit, an employer is not required to accommodate a disability by excusing past misconduct. . . ." (Dkt. No. 39 at 15, citing Watson v. Fairfax Cty., Virginia, 297 F. Supp. 3d 591, 607 (E.D. Va. 2018)). See also Miller v. Greenville Cty. Sch. Dist., No. 6:11-CV-3305-KFM, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192859, 2013 WL 12098814, at *6 (D.S.C. Sept. 18, 2013), [*36]  aff'd, 582 F. App'x 171 (4th Cir. 2014) (explaining that an employer has "no obligation under the ADA to overlook or accommodate rude behavior or insubordination"). Accordingly, Defendant did not fail to accommodate Plaintiff's alleged disability by terminating his employment and, consequently, his participation in the EAP. The undersigned therefore recommends that the Court also grant Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 35) as to Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the undersigned recommends that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 35) be GRANTED in its entirety.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
