REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. Introduction.
The plaintiff, Joel Snider, complains about events that happened at the Clinton County Correctional Facility (CCCF) while he was a pretrial detainee. He raises excessive-force claims against officers and officials at the CCCF, denial-of-medical-care claims against nurses at the CCCF, and Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") claims against the CCCF. Although Snider was pro se when he began this action, [*2]  he is now represented by counsel. We address three pending motions for summary judgment. For the reasons discussed below, we recommend that the court grant in part and deny in part the nurses' motion for summary judgment, deny Snider's motion for summary judgment, and grant the CCCF's motion for summary judgment.

II. Background and Procedural History.
Snider began this action on May 6, 2013, by filing a complaint naming more than sixty defendants. Then, in October of 2014, Snider filed an amended complaint against all of the defendants named in the original complaint. Finally, on December 19, 2015, after counsel entered an appearance on behalf of Snider, he filed a second amended complaint that dropped many of the defendants named in his earlier complaints. The second amended complaint names the following defendants: (1) Warden Jacqueline Motter; (2) Lieutenant Smith; (3) Correctional Officer Nolte; (4) Correctional Officer Shearer; (5) Correctional Officer Goshorn; (6) Correctional Officer Grimes; (7) Correctional Officer Gray; (8) Correctional Officer Walker; (9) Correctional Officer Hughes; (10) Correctional Officer Richards; (11) Nurse Rupert; (12) Nurse Andrus; and (13) the CCCF. [*3] 
According to Snider, during his incarceration at the CCCF as a pretrial detainee, he suffered from mental illness, depression, and chronic paranoid schizophrenia, all which had an adverse impact on multiple aspects of his daily life. Snider alleges that even though employees and administrators at the CCCF were aware of his mental illness, they failed to take his mental illness into consideration when determining the amount of force to be used against him, they failed to provide him with any accommodations with respect to the disciplinary process, and they subjected him to ongoing retaliation and harassment related to both his mental illness and his religion. He complains about two separate incidents when corrections officers allegedly used excessive force against him, and he complains that the nurses failed to provide appropriate medical treatment following those incidents.
The second amended complaint contains five counts. Count I is a Fourteenth Amendment excessive-force claim against defendants Hughes, Richards, and Walker arising from events on February 28, 2013. Count II is a Fourteenth Amendment excessive-force claim against defendants Smith, Nolte, Shearer, Goshorn, Grimes, and Gray arising from events on April 5, 2013. [*4]  Count III is a Fourteenth Amendment excessive-force claim against Warden Motter on the basis that she "enforced a policy or practice allowing the use of objectively unreasonable force in cell extractions against inmates with serious mental illness." Doc. 222 ¶128. Count IV raises Eighth Amendment claims against Nurses Andrus and Rupert, claiming that they were deliberately indifferent to Snider's medical needs following the uses of force against him. Finally, Count V contains ADA claims against the CCCF claiming that the CCCF discriminated against Snider and failed to provide him with reasonable accommodations for his serious mental illness. Snider seeks a declaratory judgment that the defendants violated his constitutional rights. He also seeks compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorney's fees and costs.
Three motions for summary judgment are currently pending: (1) Nurses Andrus and Rupert's motion for summary judgment; (2) Snider's motion for partial summary judgment; and (3) the CCCF's motion for summary judgment.

III. Summary Judgment Standards.
The parties move for summary judgment under Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that "[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as [*5]  to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "Through summary adjudication the court may dispose of those claims that do not present a 'genuine dispute as to any material fact' and for which a jury trial would be an empty and unnecessary formality." Goudy-Bachman v. U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, 811 F. Supp. 2d 1086, 1091 (M.D. Pa. 2011) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)).
The substantive law identifies which facts are material, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. A dispute about a material fact is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis that would allow a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id. at 248-49. When "faced with a summary judgment motion, the court must view the facts 'in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.'" N.A.A.C.P. v. N. Hudson Reg'l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d 464, 475 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007)).
At the summary judgment stage, the judge's function is not to weigh the evidence or to determine the truth of the matter; rather it is to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. The proper inquiry of the court "is the threshold inquiry of determining whether there is the need for a trial—whether, in other words, there are any genuine factual issues [*6]  that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party." Id. at 250.
Further, a party that moves for summary judgment on an issue for which he bears the ultimate burden of proof faces a difficult road. United States v. Donovan, 661 F.3d 174, 185 (3d Cir. 2011). "[I]t is inappropriate to grant summary judgment in favor of a moving party who bears the burden of proof at trial unless a reasonable juror would be compelled to find its way on the facts needed to rule in its favor on the law." El v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 479 F.3d 232, 238 (3d Cir. 2007) (footnote omitted). A party who has the burden of proof must persuade the factfinder that his propositions of fact are true, and "if there is a chance that a reasonable factfinder would not accept a moving party's necessary propositions of fact, pre-trial judgment cannot be granted." Id. "Specious objections will not, of course, defeat a motion for summary judgment, but real questions about credibility, gaps in the evidence, and doubts as to the sufficiency of the movant's proof, will." Id.

IV. Nurses Andrus and Rupert's Motion for Summary Judgment.
Snider claims that Nurses Andrus and Rupert failed to provide him with adequate medical care following the uses of force against him. Although Snider pleaded [*7]  these claims as Eighth Amendment claims, since he was a pretrial detainee at the time, the Due Process Clause, rather than the Eighth Amendment, applies. Boring v. Kozakiewicz, 833 F.2d 468, 471 (3d Cir. 1987) ("Pretrial detainees are not within the ambit of the Eighth Amendment but are entitled to the protections of the Due Process clause."). The due process rights of pretrial detainees are "at least as great" as the Eighth Amendment protections available to convicted prisoners. City of Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital, 463 U.S. 239, 244, 103 S. Ct. 2979, 77 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1983). "There is an open question of 'how much more protection unconvicted prisoners should receive' under the Fourteenth Amendment." Mattern v. City of Sea Isle, 657 F. App'x 134, 138 n.5 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Kost v. Kozakiewicz, 1 F.3d 176, 188 n.10 (3d Cir. 1993)). Nevertheless, in the medical-care context, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has applied the standards set forth in Eighth Amendment cases to medical-care claims by pretrial detainees. See e.g., Parkell v. Morgan, 682 F. App'x 155, 159 (3d Cir. 2017) (evaluating pretrial detainee's medical-care claim under the standards used for Eighth Amendment claims); Natale v. Camden Cty. Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d 575, 581-82 (3d Cir. 2003) (same). Because Snider has relied on Eighth Amendment standards in support of his claims against the nurses, "we do not decide whether the Due Process Clause provides additional protections to pretrial detainees beyond those provided by the Eighth Amendment to convicted prisoners." Natale, 318 F.3d at 581 n.5. Thus, even though Snider was a pretrial detainee when all relevant events occurred, we analyze his claims against Nurses Andrus and Rupert under the Eighth Amendment standard.

A. The Material Facts.
A party who seeks to resist a summary judgment [*8]  motion must comply with Local Rule 56.1, which specifically provides that "[s]tatements of material facts in support of, or in opposition to, a motion shall include references to the parts of the record that support the statements" and that "[a]ll material facts set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving party will be deemed admitted unless controverted by the statement required to be served by the opposing party." Under this Rule, the failure to follow these instructions and appropriately challenge the material facts tendered by the moving party means that those facts are deemed admitted. Further, a party opposing a motion for summary judgment may not "rely merely upon bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions." Fireman's Ins. Co. of Newark v. DuFresne, 676 F.2d 965, 969 (3d Cir. 1982). Rather, "[o]nce the moving party has supplied sufficient affidavits in support of its motion, the opposing party must respond by supplementing the record in some manner—whether by its own affidavits or otherwise—setting forth specific facts demonstrating that there is a genuinely disputed factual issue for trial." Id.
Here, Nurses Andrus and Rupert filed a statement of material facts to which Snider replied. Because Snider is the nonmoving party, where there [*9]  is a dispute as to the facts, we accept Snider's version of the facts.

1. The February 28, 2013 Incident.
Snider was detained at the CCCF as a pretrial detained from December 6, 2012, through May 7, 2013. Doc. 256 ¶ 11 and Doc. 273 ¶ 11. Snider alleges that on February 28, 2013, while being escorted to a housing block, correctional officers shackled his legs and arms behind his back in an excessively tight manner, causing him extreme pain. Id. ¶ 19. He also alleges that correctional officers pushed, tackled, and choked him. Doc. 273 ¶ 19. He alleges this incident caused him injuries including swelling of his wrists; neck and shoulder pain; numb thumbs; and increased anxiety. Doc. 256 ¶ 20 and Doc. 273 ¶ 20. According to Snider, he experienced pain in his wrists, shoulder, and neck for weeks after the incident. Doc. 273 ¶ 20. Snider contends that he advised Nurse Rupert of his injuries, but she refused to treat him. Doc. 256 ¶ 21 and Doc. 273 ¶ 21. According to Snider, Nurse Rupert examined him for less than a minute and did not assess any of his injuries. Doc. 273 ¶ 21. He requested Tylenol and ice, but Nurse Rupert said nothing in response to that request. Id.
A nursing assessment dated [*10]  March 2, 2013, provides that PrimeCare Medical staff saw Snider and treated him for his alleged injuries. Doc. 256 ¶ 22 and Doc. 273 ¶ 22. He was prescribed Ibuprofen for his symptoms. Id. But this visit occurred only after Snider filed a grievance complaining that Nurse Rupert provided inadequate medical care on February 28, 2013. Doc. 273 ¶ 22. And before he filed that grievance, he had repeatedly requested treatment whenever nurses handed out medication to the cells and through sick call slips, all of which were ignored. Id.

2. The April 5, 2013 Incident.
Snider alleges that on April 5, 2013, officers extracted him from his cell and sprayed him with pepper spray. Doc. 256 ¶ 23 and Doc. 273 ¶ 23. According to Snider, as result of officers physically assaulting him during the cell extraction, he sustained injuries including a lump on his head; facial abrasions; and pain in his arms, shoulder, hands, thumb, and neck. Doc. 273 ¶ 23. Before officers put him in a cell after spraying him with pepper spray, they provided Snider a shower, and he chose when to turn off the water. Doc. 256 ¶ 24 and Doc. 273 ¶ 24. Officers left Snider in the shower alone, and he was unable to see from the effects [*11]  of the pepper spray. Doc. 273 ¶ 24. He turned off the water when the water increased the pain of the pepper spray burning his skin. Id.
Snider alleges that officers then placed him in a cell without soap, a towel, or toilet paper. Doc. 256 ¶ 25 and Doc. 273 ¶ 25. He further alleges he was in so much pain he could barely open his eyes, he could not sit, he was shaking, and he held his jumpsuit away from his skin because it was causing extreme pain. Id. ¶ 26. He avers that Nurse Andrus and Nurse Rupert saw him in pain and saw that he had a swollen left eye and nose; cuts on his ear and nose; a large knot on his forehead; and red, swollen wrists, ankles, and left arm. Id. ¶ 27. He contends that Nurse Andrus and Nurse Rupert refused to treat his injuries, pain, or burning skin. Id. ¶ 28.
Nurse Andrus testified that she was present for Snider's cell extraction, which followed the standard protocol for how a cell extraction was to take place. Id. ¶¶ 29-30. Nurse Rupert testified that she was also present for Snider's cell extraction. Doc. 256 ¶ 35 and Doc. 273 ¶ 35. She further testified that after an inmate is pepper sprayed, the proper procedure is to allow the inmate to shower and then [*12]  assess him for his injuries. Id. ¶ 36.
According to Snider's dispensary card, on the day of his cell extraction, April 5, 2013, Nurse Andrus saw and examined Snider and determined that he had received abrasions to the left side of his nose and ear. Id. ¶¶ 31-32. Although the dispensary card records that Snider had no discernable swelling, Snider contends that he had swelling that lasted more than a week after the incident, and he had pain in his arms, neck, and shoulder that lasted for several months. Doc. 273 ¶ 32. When Snider complained that he thought his left wrist was fractured, Nurse Andrus conducted a push-and-pull test to determine the extent of his wrist injuries. Doc. 256 ¶ 33 and Doc. 273 ¶ 33. According to the dispensary card, Snider had no problems or pain while completing this test and no fracture was noted. Id. Nurse Andrus testified that Snider complained only about pain in his wrists, that he never mentioned to her any pain associated with the use of pepper spray, and that if Snider would have complained about the pepper spray, she would have noted that in her report. Id. ¶ 34. Snider testified, however, that he informed Nurse Andrus that his skin, genitals, and anus [*13]  were burning from the pepper spray. Doc. 273 ¶ 34. And Nurse Andrus and Nurse Rupert were present during the cell extraction while Snider was shouting in pain due to the effects of the pepper spray. Id.
Snider testified that immediately after the April 5th cell extraction, he continued to take the Tylenol that had been prescribed on March 2, 2013. Doc. 273 ¶ 38 and Doc. 279 ¶ 38. He remained in pain, and he was not provided with any additional pain medicine. Id. ¶ 39. Snider's attorney and others saw obvious signs of swelling at least five days after the cell extraction. Id. ¶ 40. Despite repeated attempts and sick call slips asking to been seen by medical staff, Snider was not seen until April 23, at which time he was prescribed Tylenol. Id. ¶¶ 41-42.

B. Discussion.
"An inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met." Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976). In order for a plaintiff to establish an Eighth Amendment medical claim, he must show that the defendant acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. Id. at 104; see also Groman v. Township of Manalapan, 47 F.3d 628, 637 (3d Cir. 1995) ("Failure to provide medical care to a person in custody can rise to the level of a constitutional violation under § 1983 only if [*14]  that failure rises to the level of deliberate indifference to that person's serious medical needs."). This is a two-part inquiry: "a plaintiff must make (1) a subjective showing that 'the defendants were deliberately indifferent to [his or her] medical needs' and (2) an objective showing that 'those needs were serious.'" Pearson v. Prison Health Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 534 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Rouse v. Plantier, 182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999)).
Nurse Rupert and Nurse Andrus contend that Snider received medical treatment and that his claims against them amount to nothing more than a difference in the choice of treatment provided, which is insufficient to establish an Eighth Amendment claim. We do not construe defendants Rupert and Andrus to be arguing that Snider cannot establish the objective showing required for an Eighth Amendment claim, i.e., that his medical needs were serious. Rather, we construe them to be arguing that Snider cannot establish the subjective showing required, i.e., that they were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs.
Deliberate indifference is a subjective standard. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 840, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994). "To act with deliberate indifference to serious medical needs is to recklessly disregard a substantial risk of serious harm." Giles v. Kearney, 571 F.3d 318, 330 (3d Cir. 2009). The prison official must have known of the substantial risk of serious harm and must have disregarded that [*15]  risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. "[T]he official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference." Id.
The mere misdiagnosis of a condition or medical need, or negligent treatment provided for a condition, is not actionable as a constitutional claim because medical malpractice is not a constitutional violation. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835 (holding that "deliberate indifference describes a state of mind more blameworthy than negligence"); Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 235 (3d Cir. 2004) ("Allegations of medical malpractice are not sufficient to establish a Constitutional violation."); Singletary v. Pa. Dep't of Corr., 266 F.3d 186, 192 n. 2 (3d Cir. 2002) (claims of medical malpractice, absent evidence of a culpable state of mind, do not constitute deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment). Instead, deliberate indifference represents a much higher standard, one that requires "obduracy and wantonness, which has been likened to conduct that includes recklessness or a conscious disregard of a serious risk." Rouse, 182 F.3d at 197 (quoting Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 319, 106 S. Ct. 1078, 89 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1986)).
"Indeed, prison authorities are accorded considerable latitude in the diagnosis and treatment of prisoners." Durmer v. O'Carroll, 991 F.2d 64, 67 (3d Cir. 1993) (citations omitted). And courts will "disavow any attempt to second guess the propriety [*16]  or adequacy of a particular course of treatment . . . (which) remains a question of sound professional judgment." Spencer v. Courtier, 552 F. App'x 121, 124 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Inmates of Allegheny County Jail v. Pierce, 612 F.2d 754, 762 (3d Cir. 1979)). "Mere disagreement as to the proper medical treatment does not support an Eighth Amendment claim." Caldwell v. Luzerne Cnty. Corr. Facility Mgmt. Employees, 732 F. Supp. 2d 458, 472 (M.D. Pa. 2010).
The Third Circuit has found deliberate indifference where a prison official: "(1) knows of a prisoner's need for medical treatment but intentionally refuses to provide it; (2) delays necessary medical treatment based on a non-medical reason; or (3) prevents a prisoner from receiving needed or recommended medical treatment." Rouse, 182 F.3d at 197. The Third Circuit has also held that "[n]eedless suffering resulting from the denial of simple medical care, which does not serve any penological purpose . . . violates the Eighth Amendment." Atkinson v. Taylor, 316 F.3d 257, 266 (3d Cir. 2003). "For instance, prison officials may not, with deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of the inmate, opt for 'an easier and less efficacious treatment' of the inmate's condition." Palakovic v. Wetzel, 854 F.3d 209, 228 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting West v. Keve, 571 F.2d 158, 162 (3d Cir. 1978)). "Nor may 'prison authorities deny reasonable requests for medical treatment . . . [when] such denial exposes the inmate to undue suffering or the threat of tangible residual injury.'" Id. (quoting Monmouth Cnty. Corr. Institutional Inmates, 834 F.2d at 346). Thus, "[a] 'failure to provide adequate care . . . [that] was deliberate, and motivated [*17]  by non-medical factors' is actionable under the Eighth Amendment, but 'inadequate care [that] was a result of an error in medical judgment' is not." Parkell v. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, 337 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Durmer, 991 F.2d at 69).
"[T]here is a critical distinction 'between cases where the complaint alleges a complete denial of medical care and those alleging inadequate medical treatment.'" Pearson, 850 F.3d at 535 (quoting United States ex. rel. Walker v. Fayette Cty., 599 F.2d 573, 575 n.2 (3d Cir. 1979)). "Because 'mere disagreement as to the proper medical treatment' does not 'support a claim of an eighth amendment violation,' when medical care is provided, we presume that the treatment of a prisoner is proper absent evidence that it violates professional standards of care." Id. (quoting Monmouth Cty. Corr. Inst., 834 F.2d at 346). And "there are two very distinct subcomponents to the deliberate indifference prong of an adequacy of care claim." Id. at 536. "The first is the adequacy of the medical care—an objective inquiry where expert testimony could be helpful to the jury." Id. "The second is the individual defendant's state of mind—a subjective inquiry that can be proven circumstantially without expert testimony." Id. But a claim that medical care was delayed or denied completely "must be approached differently than an adequacy of care claim." Id. at 537. "Unlike the deliberate indifference prong of an adequacy of care claim (which involves [*18]  both an objective and subjective inquiry), the deliberate indifference prong of a delay or denial of medical treatment claim involves only one subjective inquiry—since there is no presumption that the defendant acted properly, it lacks the objective, propriety of medical treatment, prong of an adequacy of care claim." Id. "All that is needed is for the surrounding circumstances to be sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that the delay or denial was motivated by non-medical factors." Id.

1. The February 28, 2013 Incident.
The material facts, taken in the light most favorable to Snider, show that Snider advised Nurse Rupert of his injuries following the February 28, 2013 cell extraction, but she refused to treat him. Doc. 256 ¶ 21 and Doc. 273 ¶ 21. According to Snider, Nurse Rupert examined him for less than a minute, and she did not assess any of his injuries. Doc. 273 ¶ 21. He requested Tylenol and ice, to which Nurse Rupert said nothing. Id.
"Where a prisoner has received some amount of medical treatment, it is difficult to establish deliberate indifference, because prison officials are afforded considerable latitude in the diagnosis and treatment of prisoners." Palakovic, 854 F.3d at 227. "Nonetheless, [*19]  there are circumstances in which some care is provided yet it is insufficient to satisfy constitutional requirements." Id. Here, even though Nurse Rupert examined Snider after the February 28, 2013 cell extraction, according to Snider, she did so for less than a minute, she did not assess any of his injuries, and she failed to respond to his request for treatment. Given these facts, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Nurse Rupert was deliberately indifferent to Snider's serious medical needs.
PrimeCare Medical staff saw Snider March 2, 2013, and prescribed Ibuprofen for his symptoms, doc. 256 ¶ 22 and doc. 273 ¶ 22, but that was after Snider had filed a grievance complaining that Nurse Rupert provided inadequate medical care on February 28, 2013, doc. 273 ¶ 22. And that he received treatment later, does not mean that Nurse Rupert was not deliberately indifferent to Snider's serious medical needs on February 28, 2013. Accordingly, the court should not grant summary judgment to Nurse Rupert based on the February 28, 2013 incident. But because the material facts do not show that Nurse Andrus was involved in refusing to provide medical care following the February 28, 2013 incident, [*20]  she is entitled to summary judgment as to the claim relating to the February 28, 2013 incident.

2. The April 5, 2013 Incident.
According to Snider, after the April 5, 2013 cell extraction, Nurse Andrus and Nurse Rupert saw him in pain and saw that he had a swollen left eye and nose; cuts on his ear and nose; a large knot on his forehead; and red, swollen wrists, ankles, and left arm. Id. ¶27. But they refused to treat his injuries, pain, or burning skin. Id. ¶ 28. Nurse Andrus did, however, examine Snider's wrist—she conducted a push-and-pull test and noted that Snider had no problems or pain while completing this test and no fracture. Doc. 256 ¶ 33 and Doc. 273 ¶ 33. Given this, Nurse Andrus cannot be seen to have been deliberately indifferent concerning Snider's wrist injury.
But there is a genuine factual dispute about whether Snider complained to the nurses about the effects of the pepper spray. And that dispute is material to whether the nurses could be seen to have been deliberately indifferent. Because Snider is the nonmoving party, we must accept his version of the facts as true at this stage of the proceedings. Snider testified that he informed Nurse Andrus that his skin, genitals, [*21]  and anus were burning from the pepper spray, and Nurse Andrus and Nurse Rupert were present during the cell extraction while Snider was shouting in pain due to the effects of the pepper spray. Doc. 273 ¶ 34. Yet, neither Nurse Andrus nor Nurse Rupert provided Snider any treatment for the pain associated with the use of the pepper spray or for Snider's other injuries (other than the wrist injury) that he contends he received because of the cell extraction. Thus, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Nurse Andrus and Nurse Rupert were deliberately indifferent to Snider's serious medical needs. Accordingly, they are not entitled to summary judgment as to the claim against them regarding the April 5, 2013 incident.

V. Snider's Motion for Summary Judgment.

A. Medical-Care Claims.
Snider seeks summary judgment against Nurses Andrus and Rupert as to his claim based on the alleged denial of care after officers sprayed him with pepper spray on April 5, 2013. As discussed above, there is a genuine factual dispute about whether Snider complained to the nurses about the effects of the pepper spray when they examined him. And that dispute is material to whether the nurses could be seen to [*22]  have been deliberately indifferent. Whereas, in connection with Nurses Andrus and Rupert's motion for summary, we accepted Snider's version of the facts, in connection with Snider's motion for summary judgment, we accept the nurses' version of the facts. And accepting their version, i.e., that Snider did not complain about the effects of the pepper spray when he was examined, we cannot say as a matter of law that Nurses Andrus and Rupert were deliberately indifferent to a serious medical need of Snider. Thus, Snider is not entitled to summary judgment.

B. Use of Pepper Spray.
Snider seeks summary judgment in his favor as to his claim against defendants Smith and Motter based on the use of pepper spray on April 5, 2013.

1. Material Facts.1
Defendants Smith and Motter raise hearsay objections to certain facts set forth by Snider in his statement of material facts. "Hearsay statements that would be inadmissible at trial may not be considered for purposes of summary judgment." Smith v. City of Allentown, 589 F.3d 684, 693 (3d Cir. 2009). But "hearsay statements can be considered on a motion for summary judgment if they are capable of admission at trial." Shelton v. Univ. of Med. & Dentistry of New Jersey, 223 F.3d 220, 223 n.2 (3d Cir. 2000). Thus, "[i]n ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court need only determine if the . . [*23]  . party can produce admissible evidence regarding a[n] . . . issue of material fact at trial." Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 1 v. City of Camden, 842 F.3d 231, 2016 WL 6803036, at *3 (3d Cir. Nov. 17, 2016). And "[t]he proponent need only 'explain the admissible form that is anticipated.'" Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 advisory committee's note to 2010 amendment). Where the plaintiff identifies the out-of-court declarant and the declarant is available to testify at trial, the statements would be admissible at trial and, thus, the court may consider them at the summary-judgment stage. Id.
Here, Snider has not responded to the defendants' hearsay objections. Thus, he has not explained how the evidence to which the defendants objected on hearsay grounds would be admissible. Accordingly, we do not consider the facts to which the defendants objected based on hearsay.

a. Introductory Facts.
Snider was a pretrial detainee at the CCCF from December 6, 2012, until May 7, 2013. Doc. 264 ¶ 1 and Doc. 278.2 The CCCF is a jail operated by Clinton County, which houses pretrial detainees in both general population and segregated custody units. Id. ¶ 2.
Defendant Warden Motter was a CCCF employee in charge of supervising operations at the jail, including but not limited to ensuring employees were properly trained and enforcing [*24]  and revising (subject to approval by the Prison Board) jail policies at all relevant times. Doc. 264 ¶ 3 and Doc. 278 ¶ 3. Defendant Lieutenant Smith was a CCCF employee responsible for overseeing jail staff, carrying out cell extractions, using Oleoresin Capsium ("OC") pepper spray, and issuing disciplinary sanctions. Doc. 264 ¶ 4 and Doc. 278. Defendants Correctional Officers Gray, Grimes, Goshorn, Nolte, and Shearer were CCCF employees who were each assigned to the cell-extraction team deployed to Snider's cell on April 5, 2013. Id. ¶ 5. Defendant Shearer was also tasked with monitoring the housing blocks, which included issuing misconducts. Id. ¶ 6. Defendant Shearer issued the misconducts of April 5, 2013, that led to the cell extraction at issue here. Id. ¶ 7. Defendants Nurse Rupert and Nurse Andrus, employees of Prime Care Medical, Inc., were assigned to the CCCF and tasked with assessing prisoners at intake and providing medical care. Doc. 264 ¶ 8 and Doc. 278 ¶8.

b. Snider's Disability.
Snider was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and depression prior to his incarceration. Doc. 264 ¶ 9 and Doc. 278 ¶9.3 He experienced "[p]aranoia, delusions, fear of certain people . . . [*25]  auditory hallucinations" and strange sensations. Id. ¶ 12.4 Snider heard these auditory hallucinations as voices from his past that demeaned and intimidated him. Id. ¶ 13. He also experienced sleep irregularities, confusion especially when making decisions, and suicidal behavior. Id. ¶15.
During Snider's pretrial confinement, he was further diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Id. ¶ 16. During his incarceration at the CCCF, Snider was anxious that others were conspiring to "cause [him] problems." Id. ¶ 20. He experienced the sensation that spirits were "trying to take over [his] body." Id. ¶ 21. He believed that objects around him were contaminated, and so he avoided eating or drinking for days. Id. ¶ 22. He was afraid of his delusions, which led him constantly to wash his hands until his skin broke. Id. ¶ 23. Snider had difficulty sleeping because of "unusual and frightening startling nightmares." Id. ¶ 24. Snider experienced stabbing sensations associated with the voices that compelled him to use or not use certain words. [*26]  Id. ¶ 25. These sensations substantially interfered with his ability to communicate effectively with others, through either speech or writing. Id. ¶ 26. Snider experienced confusion that prevented him from doing simple tasks such as washing his hands or bathing. Id. ¶ 27. He had difficulty learning, concentrating, or communicating during his delusions. Id. ¶ 28. Snider's condition worsened whenever he was placed in a stressful situation. Id. ¶ 29.
Despite Snider's mental health problems, many of the staff at the CCCF considered him "quiet," "very peaceful," and "very respectful." Doc. 264 ¶ 30 and Doc. 278. Immediately before arriving at the CCCF, Snider was incarcerated at the Union County Jail, where he had not received any misconduct reports. Id. ¶¶ 31-32. Union County Jail Warden Douglas Shaffer informed Warden Motter that Snider was "very respectful to staff." Id. ¶ 33. Snider identified his mental disabilities to Nurse Rupert during intake. Id. ¶ 34. Rupert informed defendant Lieutenant Smith of Snider's mental health problems through an extraordinary report. Id. ¶ 35. All CCCF staff had access to the extraordinary reports for three to five days after they were filed in case something [*27]  unusual happened involving an individual with a mental disability. Doc. 264 ¶ 36 and Doc. 278 ¶ 36.

c. The CCCF'S Inmate-Discipline Policy.
At the CCCF, misconducts are classified into three infraction levels. Doc. 264 ¶ 37 and Doc. 278. Class I and Class II infractions are more serious in nature than Class III infractions. Id. ¶ 38.
A Class I infraction carries penalties of up to 60 days in the Restricted Housing Unit ("RHU"), up to 60 days loss of privileges, and restitution. Id. ¶ 39. The RHU, located on L Block, is designed to segregate prisoners from the general population for administrative and disciplinary purposes. Doc. 264 ¶ 40 and Doc. 278 ¶ 40. Individuals in the RHU are restricted to their cell for 23 hours a day. Id. ¶ 41. They may also lose commissary privileges, recreation privileges, family visits, and they may be suspended from group activities except as authorized by the Warden or her designee. Id. A Class II infraction can result in a maximum of 30 days in the RHU, as well as 30 days loss of privileges. Doc. 264 ¶ 42 and Doc. 278. For Class I and II offenses, the Misconduct Hearing Committee may go outside the disciplinary sanction matrix when assigning sanctions, but [*28]  the sanctions may not exceed 60 days of disciplinary segregation for all violations arising out of one incident. Doc. 264 ¶ 43 and Doc. 278 ¶ 43.
A Class III infraction is the only infraction level for which confinement in the RHU may not be ordered; instead, such an infraction may result in a verbal or written reprimand, in-cell confinement for up to 24 hours, or the loss of privileges for up to seven days. Id. ¶ 44. A prisoner on 24-hour lockdown is locked in his or her cell for a full 24 hours and is denied privileges such as commissary or visitation. Doc. 264 ¶ 45 and Doc. 278. In addition, only Class III infractions can result in the lesser penalties of a verbal or written reprimand, or they may be resolved informally through a counseling session. Id. ¶ 46. Unlike Class I and II infractions, an individual "cannot be put on full restriction" for a Class III infraction. Id. ¶ 47. Full restriction prohibits individuals from taking advantage of most prison services except as authorized by the Warden or her designee. Doc. 264 ¶ 48 and Doc. 278 ¶ 48.
The corrections officer who witnesses and issues the misconduct initially determines the violation's infraction level; the shift commander [*29]  then reviews the misconduct, interviews the inmate, and determines the disciplinary category of each infraction. Id. ¶ 49. Many Class II and Class III infractions can be issued for the same conduct. Doc. 264 ¶ 50 and Doc. 278. For instance, there is a Class II infraction for "Disobeying Written or Verbal Order from Staff" and a Class III infraction for "Failure to Follow Directions From Staff." Id. ¶ 52. Likewise, a "Disorderly Conduct" could be issued as either a Class II or Class III Infraction. Id. ¶ 53. While a Class II infraction may be issued for "Willful Destruction of County Property," the Class III infractions for "Destruction of County Property" and "Defacing County Property" are also available. Id. ¶ 54.
There are no written guidelines on when to issue a Class II as opposed to a similar Class III infraction, and that decision is generally left to a correction officer's discretion. Doc. 264 ¶ 51 and Doc. 278 ¶ 51. Corrections officers may consider factors such as the number of times the inmate had committed the same infraction and the severity of the infraction. Doc. 278 ¶ 51.
The CCCF corrections officers are trained to write down all disciplinary offenses that could apply. [*30]  Doc. 264 ¶ 55 and Doc. 278. This led to corrections officers issuing multiple disciplinary offenses based on a single incident. Doc. 264 ¶ 56 and Doc. 278 ¶ 56. The Lieutenant on duty reviewed the misconducts. Doc. 264 ¶ 57 and Doc. 278. Misconduct hearings were then held to determine the validity of the charges and issue punishments. Id. ¶ 59.
The CCCF inmate-discipline policy provides that "[w]hen deemed necessary, the Shift Commander may place an inmate on pre-hearing detention (administrative segregation pending the hearing)." Doc. 265-18 (CCCF's inmate-discipline policy) at 9.5 Also, individuals should be placed in administrative segregation in the RHU prior to a hearing only if their "continued presence . . . in general population would pose a serious threat to the security of the institution, its orderly operation, or the personal safety of staff or inmates." Doc. 264 ¶ 60 and Doc. 278. Despite this, as a matter of practice, Class I and II infractions almost always result in administrative segregation in the RHU pending a hearing. Doc. 264 ¶ 61 and Doc. 278 ¶ 61. Defendant Motter, who considered most Class I and Class II infractions serious offenses, had the authority to override [*31]  the segregation. Id. ¶¶ 61-62 and Doc. 265-4 (Motter Dep.) at 64-65.

d. The CCCF'S Use-of-Force Policy.
The CCCF's use-of-force policy permits the use of force by CCCF staff against prisoners to "prevent destruction of property . . . [t]o restrain a physically violent inmate . . . [and] [t]o move an inmate who refuses to cooperate." Doc. 264 ¶ 63 and Doc. 278 P63. This policy provides that its use-of-force guidelines are to "be strictly followed." Id. ¶ 64. Corrections staff are to use "the minimal amount of force necessary" to control an inmate or situation. Id. ¶ 65. According to the policy, force should be used only "after all other means to handle the situation have been exhausted." Id. ¶ 66 and Doc. 265-6 (CCCF's use-of-force policy) at 8.
The Lieutenant has authority to commence and gather a five-man cell extraction team upon authorization from the Warden. Doc. 264 ¶ 67 and Doc. 278. In addition, medical staff must be present throughout to assess injuries to those involved in the extraction. Id. ¶ 68. Prior to the extraction, the Lieutenant briefs the corrections officers and medical staff. Id. ¶ 69. These pre-extraction briefings would include discussions about whether the individual had physical infirmities [*32]  such as asthma or a wheelchair, but they would not include discussions of mental illness. Id. ¶ 70.
The Lieutenant and extraction team first station themselves in sight of the prisoner to give the prisoner one final chance to comply. Id. ¶ 71. Next, the Lieutenant can use OC. Id. ¶ 72. The policy provides that "[b]efore using a chemical agent, the Shift Commander should inform the inmate(s) that unless they carry out his/her orders, chemical agents may be used against them." Doc. 264 ¶ 73 and Doc. 278. ¶ 73 and Doc. 265-6 (CCCF's use-of-force policy) at 18. OC is applied directly to the face, and it irritates the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and skin. Doc. 264 ¶ 74 and Doc. 278 ¶ 74. The policy provides that the Lieutenant should not use OC against an individual with certain physical medical problems, such as "asthma, respiratory problems, open wounds, etc.," "except in extreme emergency situations." Id. ¶ 75 and Doc. 265-6 (CCCF's use-of-force policy) at 18. There is no similar prohibition in CCCF policy on using OC on individuals with mental illness. Doc. 264 ¶ 76 and Doc. 278. The CCCF's written policy prohibits the use of OC on individuals who offer only "passive resistance." Doc. 264 [*33]  ¶ 77 and Doc. 278 ¶ 77.
If the first use of OC is ineffective, additional bursts are administered until the individual becomes submissive or is "not capable of resisting or fighting to their full potential." Doc. 264 ¶ 80 and Doc. 278. Finally, the extraction team enters the cell and forces the individual against the wall with an electrically-charged shield called an Electronic Body Immobilization Device ("EBID") while the four other members grab the person's limbs. Id. ¶ 82. Those involved in physical use of force incidents are automatically sent to the RHU. Id. ¶ 83. According to the policy, a prisoner exposed to OC must be washed off after they are taken to a segregated area. Id. ¶ 81.

e. April 5, 2013.
On the afternoon of April 5, 2013, Snider visited the CCCF psychiatrist because his mental health issues were giving him a "'really difficult time.'" Doc. 264 ¶ 107 and Doc. 278. An hour and a half later, defendant Shearer noticed Snider outside of his cell without a nametag. Doc. 264 ¶ 115 and Doc. 278 ¶ 115. Shearer issued a misconduct report to Snider for failing to wear his nametag. Id. ¶ 116.6 The misconduct report charged Snider with Class III infractions: one for failure to maintain [*34]  personal hygiene, dress code, or display I.D. card; and one for failure to follow directions from staff. Id. Defendant Shearer did not consider Snider's mental illness when issuing this misconduct report. Doc. 264 ¶ 117 and Doc. 278. Defendant Smith found Snider guilty of this misconduct and placed him on 24-hour lockdown. Id. ¶ 118.
Approximately 15 minutes after defendant Shearer issued the previous misconduct report, Snider and Shearer got into a verbal altercation while Shearer was delivering a tray to Snider. Id. at P120. Shearer immediately issued a second misconduct report, charging Snider with the following Class II infractions: disobeying a written or verbal order from staff, disorderly conduct, threatening or abusive language, disrupting the normal routine, and insolence or disrespect towards staff. Id. ¶ 121. Shearer wrote in this misconduct report that Snider told him to "take that fucking tray and rub it on your chest." Doc. 265-30 (misconduct report) at 2. Shearer again did not consider Snider's mental illness when issuing this misconduct report. Doc. 264 ¶ 122 and Doc. 278.
According to Snider, these misconduct reports escalated the situation and caused him [*35]  stress, which aggravated his mental condition. Doc. 264 ¶ 124 and Doc. 278 ¶ 124. Snider also perceived Shearer as harassing and targeting him. Id. In Snider's frustration, he hit his metal cell door. Id. ¶ 125.7 Snider did not dent
Fifteen minutes after defendant Shearer issued the second misconduct report, he issued a third misconduct report based on Snider hitting his cell door. Id. ¶ 126. This misconduct report charged Snider with the following Class II infractions: disobeying a written or verbal order from staff, willful destruction of county property, disorderly conduct, and disrupting the normal routine. Id. Defendant Shearer did not consider Snider's mental illness when issuing this misconduct report. Id. ¶ 128.
Defendants Shearer and Goshorn then ordered Snider to report to the Lieutenant's office, but Snider refused to leave his cell. Id. ¶ 132. Rather, Snider moved to the rear of his cell, and, according to Snider, he was "meditating and singing," in an attempt to "calm [himself] down" from the upsetting situation. Doc. 264 ¶ 133 and Doc. 278 ¶ 133. Defendant Lieutenant Smith then approached Snider's cell to talk with him about [*36]  the misconduct reports. Doc. 264 ¶ 134 and Doc. 278. Snider begged Smith to let him speak with Deputy Warden Bechdel. Doc. 264 ¶ 135 and Doc. 278 ¶ 135. Smith advised Snider that Bechdel was not on duty and was not available to speak with him at that time. Doc. 278 ¶ 135. Smith also informed Snider that they would remove him from the cell by force if he did not submit to handcuffs. Doc. 264 ¶ 136 and Doc. 278. According to Snider, he was worried about submitting to the defendants, who he believed had previously taken his religious property. Doc. 264 ¶ 137 and Doc. 278 ¶ 137.
Defendant Smith asked for and received approval from defendant Warden Motter to perform a cell extraction. Doc. 264 ¶ 138 and Doc. 278. This cell extraction was authorized without consideration or discussion of Snider's disability. Id. ¶ 139. As per CCCF policy, defendant Smith assigned defendants Grimes, Gray, Goshorn, Nolte, and Shearer to the extraction team. Id. ¶ 140. Defendants Gray, Goshorn, Nolte, and Shearer were assigned to grab each of Snider's limbs, and defendant Grimes handled the EBID. Id. ¶ 141. The corrections officers on the extraction team were trained in the CCCF's use-of-force policy. Id. P142. Defendant [*37]  Nurses Andrus and Rupert were present during the cell extraction to provide medical assistance. Id. ¶ 143.
Defendant Smith briefed the extraction team as to their specific assignments in performing the extraction and to make them aware of any "extraordinary event that might be pertinent to them." Doc. 264 ¶ 144 and Doc. 278 P144. Snider's mental illness was not discussed during the briefing. Doc. 264 ¶ 145 and Doc. 278.
Defendant Smith and the extraction team then approached Snider's cell where Smith told Snider to submit to handcuffs or force would be used against him. Id. at ¶ 148. According to Snider, the voice of God told him to wait for Deputy Warden Bechdel and not to go with the defendants. Doc. 264 ¶ 149 and Doc. 278 ¶ 149. Snider continued to beg defendant Smith to allow him to speak with Deputy Warden Bechdel. Id. P150. Smith advised Snider that he could do that on Monday. Doc. 266, Exhibit GG (video of cell extraction). Snider repeatedly complained about officers stealing his things. Id. After defendant Smith directed Snider to come to the door to "cuff up" several times and Snider refused to do so, defendant Smith entered Snider's cell and sprayed him with a burst of OC. Doc. 264 [*38]  ¶ 151 and Doc. 278 ¶ 151.
Defendant Smith then ordered Snider to come to the door and submit to handcuffs three more times, and he warned Snider that if he did not comply, the OC would be reapplied. Doc. 266, Exhibit GG (video of cell extraction). Snider did not go to the cell door to be handcuffed. Id. According to Snider, he was barely able to speak or hear immediately after the first burst of OC. Doc. 264 ¶ 154 and Doc. 278. P154. Defendant Smith applied a second burst of OC because Snider refused to submit to handcuffs. Doc. 264 ¶ 155 and Doc. 278.
Smith again ordered Snider to come to the door to be handcuffed, and he told Snider that this was his last chance or the extraction team would enter his cell. Doc. 266, Exhibit GG (video of cell extraction). Snider still did not go to the cell door to be handcuffed. Id. The extraction team then rushed into Snider's cell, pushed him to the wall with the EBID, and then "piled on top of [him]." Doc. 264 ¶ 157 and Doc. 278 ¶ 157. The extraction team ultimately grabbed Snider's wrists and tightened shackles and handcuffs onto his limbs before lifting him off the ground. Doc. 264 ¶ 158 and Doc. 278. Snider kept his hands under his body, but [*39]  he never attempted to punch, kick, or otherwise harm the officers throughout the extraction. Doc. 264 ¶ 159 and Doc. 278. ¶ 159.
Once the extraction team had control of Snider, they started escorting him to the decontamination area. Doc. 264 ¶ 160 and Doc. 278. Snider lamented that he could not see, and he was off balance, as he suffered the effects of the OC. Id. at ¶ 161. The extraction team had to carry Snider before placing him in the shower. Id. at ¶ 162. While the defendants carried Snider, he said, "You're choking me." Id. at ¶ 163. The defendants removed Snider's shackles so he could remove his clothes for the shower. Id. ¶ 164. They then strip-searched him. Id. ¶ 165. Snider was left alone in the shower while he washed off the OC solely with water. Doc. 264 ¶ 166 and Doc. 278 ¶ 166.
Defendant Smith made no accommodation for Snider's mental illness when ordering the cell extraction or when using the OC. Doc. 264 ¶ 147 and Doc. 278.

2. Discussion.
To establish an excessive-force claim, "a pretrial detainee" need "show only that the force purposely or knowingly used against him was objectively unreasonable." Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473, 192 L. Ed. 2d 416 (2015). The reasonableness inquiry turns on "the facts and circumstances of each [*40]  particular case." Id. (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1989)). The following considerations "may bear on the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the force used: the relationship between the need for the use of force and the amount of force used; the extent of the plaintiff's injury; any effort made by the officer to temper or to limit the amount of force; the severity of the security problem at issue; the threat reasonably perceived by the officer; and whether the plaintiff was actively resisting." Id. These are not the only considerations that may come into play, and courts should not mechanically apply the objective reasonableness standard. Id.
Whether the force used was objectively reasonable, must be judged "from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, including what the officer knew at the time, not with the 20/20 vision of hindsight." Id. Further, "[a] court must also account for the 'legitimate interests that stem from [the government's] need to manage the facility in which the individual is detained,' appropriately deferring to 'policies and practices that in th[e] judgment' of jail officials 'are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.'"  [*41] Id. (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 540, 547, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979)).
Whether the use of force was reasonable is frequently a question for the jury. Rivas v. City of Passaic, 365 F.3d 181, 198 (3d Cir. 2004); Abraham v. Raso, 183 F.3d 279, 290 (3d Cir.1999) ("Since we lack a clearly defined rule for declaring when conduct is unreasonable in a specific context, we rely on the consensus by a jury decision to help ensure that the ultimate legal judgment of 'reasonableness' is itself reasonable and widely shared."). But summary judgment is appropriate if the "'court concludes, after resolving all factual disputes in favor of the [nonmoving party], that the officer's use of force was objectively reasonable [or objectively unreasonable] under the circumstances.'" Estate of Smith, 318 F.3d at 516 (quoting Abraham, 183 F.3d at 290).
"Pepper spray is an accepted non-lethal means of controlling unruly inmates." Danley v. Allen, 540 F.3d 1298, 1307 (11th Cir. 2008), overruling on other grounds recognized in Randall v. Scott, 610 F.3d 701, 709 (11th Cir. 2010). Yet, as it can cause serious injuries in some cases, its use must be scrutinized to determine whether its use was reasonable under the particular circumstances of the case. Cf Williams v. Benjamin, 77 F.3d 756, 763 (4th Cir. 1996) ("[W]e have closely scrutinized the use of tear gas or mace (a trade name for tear gas) in correctional facilities. This is because, even when properly used, such weapons 'possess inherently dangerous characteristics capable of causing serious and perhaps irreparable injury to the [*42]  victim.'") (citations omitted). But "it is not per se unconstitutional for guards to spray mace at prisoners confined in their cells." Id.; Passmore v. Iannello, 528 Fed. Appx. 144, 148 (3d Cir. 2013) (concluding, in an Eighth Amendment case, that where the prisoner refused numerous orders to take a shower and was warned before pepper spray was used, that "the use of pepper spray was reasonable in these circumstances and the District Court properly granted the Defendants' motion" for summary judgment).
Snider argues that defendant Smith's use of pepper spray was objectively unreasonable because he was not a danger to himself or others and he was not engaging in behavior that would disrupt other prisoners. According to Snider, he was simply sitting at the back of his cell meditating. But considering the record as a whole, including the video of the incident and the factors set forth by the Supreme Court in Kingsley, we cannot say that Snider is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the claim against Smith and Motter for the use of pepper spray.

a. The first Kingsley factor: the relationship between the need for the use of force and the amount of force used.
Here, Snider refused orders to be handcuffed so that he could be moved from his cell. Given that refusal, [*43]  some use of force could reasonably be seen to have been necessary. And Snider was warned that the pepper spray would be used if he did not comply with orders to be handcuffed. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to the defendants as the nonmoving parties, the threat of the use of pepper spray and the use of pepper spray were attempts to avoid the need to enter the cell and forcibly remove Snider, which could entail the risk of injury to Snider and to staff. Thus, the amount of force used was rationally related to the need for the use of force. See generally Danley, 540 F.3d at 1307 ("A short burst of pepper spray is not disproportionate to the need to control an inmate who has failed to obey a jailer's orders.").

b. The second Kingsley factor: the extent of Snider's injury.
"Pepper spray is 'designed to disable a suspect,' by causing 'intense pain, a burning sensation that causes mucus to come out of the nose, an involuntary closing of the eyes, a gagging reflex, and temporary paralysis of the larynx.'" Danley, 540 F.3d at 1309 (citations omitted). "It sometimes also causes 'disorientation, anxiety, and panic' in the person sprayed." Id. "Those effects are inherent in most, if not all, uses of pepper spray." Id. "That [*44]  is how it achieves its purpose." Id.
While we do not dismiss that the use of pepper spray can be painful and even dangerous in some circumstances, the injuries caused by pepper spray to a person who does not have a medical condition for which the use of pepper spray is contraindicated, is generally temporary and not particularly serious. As Snider acknowledges, his injuries from the pepper spray were not life threatening and did not require hospitalization.

c. The third Kingsley factor: efforts made to temper or limit the amount of force.
Snider contends that defendant Smith failed to temper the need for force by approving Snider's transfer to the RHU and by authorizing force when force was simply not necessary. Yet, as mentioned above, some amount of force reasonably appeared necessary as Snider refused orders to be handcuffed.
And Smith gave Snider numerous chances to be handcuffed before resorting to the use of pepper spray. Further, before spraying Snider a second time, Smith waited, again ordering Snider to cuff up multiple times, and again warned Snider that OC spray would be used. Yet Snider refused these opportunities to avoid the use of pepper spray.
Further, although Snider asserts [*45]  that he was in "the midst of a mental health crisis," doc. 263 (Snider's brief) at 16, he has not presented evidence from which we can conclude as a matter of law that he was unable to comply with the orders to be handcuffed such that the use of force in an attempt to get him to comply would be unreasonable. Cf Thomas v. Bryant, 614 F.3d 1288, 1312 (11th Cir. 2010) (holding "that the policy and practice of spraying inmates with chemical agents, as applied to McKinney under the circumstances found here—i.e., when he was fully secured in his seven-by-nine-foot steel cell, when he was not presenting a threat of immediate harm to himself or others, and when he was unable to understand and comply with officers' orders due to his mental illness—are extreme deprivations violating the 'broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity and decency' embodied in the Eighth Amendment") (citation omitted).

d. The fourth Kingsley factor: the severity of the security problem at issue.
Snider asserts that "he presented only a minimal security concern" as the misconduct reports that he received were for minor infractions and he did not threaten anyone, attempt to attack anyone, or otherwise act aggressively. Doc. 263 (Snider's brief) at 14. Although [*46]  the underlying misconduct reports that Snider received could be seen as not particularly serious, Snider refused orders to be handcuffed so that he could be moved. Refusing orders in a prison setting presents security issues. "[P]rison guards do not have the luxury or obligation to convince every inmate that their orders are reasonable and well-thought out." Danley, 540 F.3d at 1307. "Certainly they are not required to do so where an inmate repeatedly fails to follow those orders." Id.
Here, we know the general circumstances leading to the issuance of the misconducts to Snider, but some of the particulars have not been set forth in detail. For example, we know that Snider hit his cell door. The parties do not focus, however, on whether he was injured or the extent of any injury from hitting the door. Still, we cannot ignore that the misconduct report issued after Snider hit his cell door provides that Snider "began bleeding from [his] right hand." Doc. 265-31 (misconduct report) at 2. Further, defendant Shearer testified that Snider was a danger to himself. Doc. 265-11 (Shearer Dep.) at 45 ("He had already hurt himself once, so yes, he was a danger to himself."). Thus, it is difficult to determine the severity of the security [*47]  problem at issue. But given that Snider received three misconduct reports in rapid succession and refused multiple orders to be handcuffed, and construing those facts in the light most favorable to the defendants as the nonmoving parties, it would not be unreasonable for a finder of fact to infer that if the officers had entered the cell without first applying the pepper spray, Snider may not have complied with orders at that time either and greater force may have been necessary.

e. The fifth Kingsley factor: the threat reasonably perceived by Lieutenant Smith.
Snider contends that he was not a threat; rather, he was simply "sitting in his cell, trying to meditate and pray." Doc. 263 at 15. And, according to Snider, he actively tried to resolve the situation by asking for Deputy Warden Bechdel.
Yet, contrary to Snider's assertion, it is not so clear from the record that he posed no threat. The video shows that just prior to the use of pepper spray, Snider was repeatedly complaining about officers stealing his things. Given Snider's behavior, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that an officer in Smith's position could not reasonably perceive that Snider may put up a fight if the officers [*48]  entered the cell without first partially incapacitating him with pepper spray.

f. The sixth Kingsley factor: whether Snider was actively resisting.
CCCF's use-of-force policy provides that OC should not be used on an inmate who is only passively resisting. And one of the factors identified in Kingsley is whether the detainee was actively resisting.
Snider asserts that he engaged in only passive resistance. He contends that courts have repeatedly held that it is objectively unreasonable to use substantial force against an individual engaging in passive resistance. Yet the three cases that Snider cites to support that assertion found that there were genuine factual disputes precluding summary judgment as to use-of-force claims. Robinson v. Danberg, 673 F. App'x 205, 210 (3d Cir. 2016) (concluding that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment to the defendant where Robinson and the defendant offered different accounts of what happened and a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the officer's "use of force was excessive because Robinson, according to his own account, was securely locked in his cell and was offering no resistance when [the defendant] removed his handcuffs");8 Shuford v. Conway, 666 F. App'x 811, 816, 819-20 (11th Cir. 2016) (concluding that genuine material factual disputes [*49]  existed precluding summary judgment as to excessive-force claims of four pretrial detainees including two against whom pepper spray was used while they were in their cells), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 2196, 198 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2017); Panarello v. City of Vineland, 160 F. Supp. 3d 734, 759 (D.N.J. 2016) (denying the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to a Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim based on the use of OC spray in the police booking room because there were "genuine issues of material fact, regarding both the timing of the use of the OC spray and the events leading up to its use"), granting reconsideration in part on other grounds, 2016 WL 3638108, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87907, at *1 (D.N.J. July 7, 2016). None of these cases granted summary judgment to a plaintiff.
We acknowledge that in Shuford, the Eleventh Circuit did conclude that accepting the plaintiff's version of the events, the use of force was unreasonable:
Accepting the plaintiffs' version of the facts, we conclude that the RRT [Rapid Response Team]'s use of force was objectively unreasonable in the four incidents described above. In each case, plaintiffs were in isolation holding cells so the only possible threat they posed was to themselves. All four plaintiffs were arrested for nonviolent offenses. And in at least two of the incidents, before the RRT used force, the plaintiffs [*50]  were obeying commands to kneel or lie down in their cells with their hands on their heads. Also in each case, the RRT entered without warning and used techniques that resulted in audible responses of pain from the plaintiffs. One of the plaintiffs was knocked unconscious. The RRT shot two of the plaintiffs with a number of Pepperball rounds, and stunned one of them with a Taser as well. In all four cases, at the time the RRT entered, the plaintiffs appeared to be sitting or standing in their cells such that they could be restrained without the use of any force. Based on these facts, and as shown in the videos of these incidents, the plaintiffs have established that the force used in these incidents was not objectively reasonable. The factors that the Supreme Court has given as guidance—the relationship between the level of force used and the need for that force at the time it was used; the effort made to temper such force (or lack thereof); the severity of the security problem; the threat perceived; and the plaintiffs' active resistance (or again, the lack thereof)—are sufficient to establish violations of the plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment rights at the summary judgment stage. As a result, we reverse [*51]  the district court's finding that the plaintiffs' evidence failed to show a constitutional violation.
Shuford, 666 F. App'x at 816 (emphasis in original). But unlike in Shuford where the detainees were complying with orders and the team entered their cells without warning, here Snider refused to comply with numerous orders to be handcuffed and he was warned that force, including specifically the use of OC spray, would be used if he continued to do so.
However characterized, Snider's resistance made the use of force necessary. And whether he was actively, or only passively, resisting is only one factor to consider. Further, despite Snider's characterization of himself as a passive prisoner actively trying to deescalate the situation, a reasonable factfinder could come to a different conclusion based on the record and after viewing the video of the incident.
In sum, we cannot say as a matter of law that the use of pepper spray was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, Snider is not entitled to summary judgment in his favor as to his claim against Lieutenant Smith for using the pepper spray.
And because we cannot say as a matter of law that the use of the pepper spray was objectively unreasonable, [*52]  Snider is also not entitled to summary judgment in his favor as to his claim against defendant Motter for approving the cell extraction during which the pepper spray was used.
Snider asserts that Motter encouraged a practice of using unreasonable force against non-threatening prisoners. It is unclear, however, if he is seeking summary judgment as to a claim against Motter in her official capacity, which is in essence a claim against Clinton County. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690, n. 55, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978) (explaining that official-capacity suits are "only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent."). Based on the first part of his argument, it appears that he is as he cites Monell. See Doc. 263 (Snider's brief) at 18. But he then transitions to citing a case, Neil v. Allegheny Cty., No. CIV.A. 12-0348, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124368, 2012 WL 3779182, at *5 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 31, 2012), for propositions regarding supervisory liability against defendants in their individual capacities. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124368, [WL] at *18-19. In any event, Snider is not entitled to summary judgment as to defendant Motter because he has not shown an underlying constitutional violation. See Mulholland v. Gov't Cty. of Berks, Pa., 706 F.3d 227, 238 n.15 (3d Cir. 2013) ("It is well-settled that, if there is no violation in the first place, there can be no derivative municipal claim."); Crawford v. Lappin, 446 F.App'x 413, 416 (3d Cir. 2011) (stating that "the absence of [*53]  an underlying constitutional violation precludes any supervisory liability on a "knowledge or acquiescence" or "failure to train" theory"); Tri Thanh Nguyen v. Franklin Cnty., 3:10-CV-1866, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55756, 2012 WL 1378679 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 20, 2012) ("Since there was no unconstitutional conduct, supervisory liability also fails on a policy or practice approach."), aff'd , 512 F. App'x 188, 190 (3d Cir. 2013).

C. Snider's ADA Claims.
Snider contends that he is entitled to summary judgment as to his ADA claims against the CCCF. The CCCF responds that Snider is not entitled to summary judgment because, among other reasons, the statute of limitations bars the ADA claims.
The ADA does not include a statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. § 1658, enacted on December 1, 1990, provides "a catchall 4-year statute of limitations for actions arising under federal statutes enacted after December 1, 1990." Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541 U.S. 369, 371-72, 124 S. Ct. 1836, 158 L. Ed. 2d 645 (2004). Section 1658 provides:
Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues.
The ADA, however, was enacted on July 26, 1990, see PL 101-336, July 26, 1990, 104 Stat 327, before § 1658 was enacted.
Recognizing that Title II of the ADA does not include "an express statute of limitations" and that it was [*54]  "enacted prior to the effective date of the default four-year statute of limitations for federal statutes, see 28 U.S.C. § 1658," in 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that "the statute of limitations applicable to claims under Title II of the ADA . . . is the statute of limitations for personal injury actions in the state in which the trial court sits." Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania v. Se. Pennsylvania Transp. Auth., 539 F.3d 199, 208 (3d Cir. 2008). And in Pennsylvania, "the applicable statute is 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5524, which prescribes a two-year statute of limitations." Id. While Disabled in Action held that a two-year statute of limitations is applicable to claims brought under Title II of the ADA, that case was decided before the amendments to the ADA set forth in the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") became effective in 2009.
In connection with an earlier motion to dismiss, CCCF argued that Snider's ADA claims should be dismissed because he did not bring them within the applicable two-year statute of limitations. In response, Snider asserted that the four-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1658 should apply to his ADA claims rather than a two-year statute of limitations. Snider argued that his claims were filed within the applicable statute of limitations, or, in the alternative, he argued that he [*55]  was entitled to equitable tolling. Because CCCF did not reply to Snider's contentions pertaining to the appropriate statute of limitations and because the issue was not briefed, we deemed CCCF's statute-of-limitations argument to be abandoned, and we did not consider it at the motion-to-dismiss stage of the proceedings. But we noted that if CCCF wished to brief this issue for consideration at a later date, it may do so.
In opposition to Snider's motion for partial summary judgment, CCCF again raises the statute of limitations arguing that Snider's ADA claims are subject to the two-year statute of limitation applicable to personal injury claims in Pennsylvania, and because Snider's ADA claims are based on events that occurred in February and April of 2013, but he did not file his second amended complaint raising his ADA claims until December of 2015, his ADA claims are barred by the statute of limitations. Snider did not file a reply brief; thus, he did not contest CCCF's arguments regarding the statute of limitations.
On October 12, 2017, we ordered Snider to file a reply brief addressing at a minimum the CCCF's statute-of-limitations argument. Snider responded by filing a reply brief [*56]  arguing that the four-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1658 applied. In the alternative, he argued that if the two-year Pennsylvania statute of limitations applied, that statute of limitations should be equitably tolled because of his mental condition and during the time periods his multiple motions for the appointment of counsel and for leave to amend were pending, resulting in his ADA claims being timely filed. CCCF then filed, with leave of court, a surreply brief reiterating its position that Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitation, rather than § 1658's four-statute of limitations applied, and arguing that the two-year statute of limitations should not be equitably tolled.
Generally, it is relatively simple to determine which statute of limitations applies to a claim. But here, that determination depends on the effect of 2009 amendments to the ADA set forth in the ADAAA. Thus, we begin by tracing how those amendments changed the ADA.

1. The ADA.
"Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 as a 'clear and comprehensive national mandate' designed to eliminate discrimination against individuals with physical and mental disabilities across the United States."McGann v. Cinemark USA, Inc., 873 F.3d 218, 221 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101(b)(1)). Title II of the ADA, [*57]  under which Snider brings his claims, provides that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. To establish a discrimination claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish that (1) he has a disability; (2) he was otherwise qualified to participate in the service, programs, or activity of the public entity; and (3) he was denied the benefits of the service, program, or activity or was otherwise subject to discrimination because of his disability. Chambers ex rel. Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of Philadelphia Bd of Educ., 587 F.3d 176, 189 (3d Cir. 2009).
The ADA provided a three-prong definition of disability:
The term "disability" means, with respect to an individual—
(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more . . . major life activities of such individual;
(B) a record of such an impairment; or
(C) being regarded as having such an impairment.
42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) (effective until Dec. 31, 2008). In two seminal cases—Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999), and Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002)—the Supreme Court narrowly construed the definition of disability under the ADA.
In Sutton, the Supreme Court held that "the determination of whether an [*58]  individual is disabled should be made with reference to measures that mitigate the individual's impairment, including, in [that] instance, eyeglasses and contact lenses." 527 U.S. at 475. The Court also held in Sutton that an individual is "regarded as" disabled under the ADA if "(1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that [the individual] has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities." Id. at 489.
In Toyota, the Supreme Court again addressed the definition of disability in the ADA. There, the Court observed that "[t]o qualify as disabled under subsection (A) of the ADA's definition of disability, a claimant must initially prove that he or she has a physical or mental impairment." 534 U.S. at 194. But "[m]erely having an impairment does not make one disabled for purposes of the ADA." Id. at 195. Rather, the impairment must substantially limit a major life activity. Id. In Toyota, the Court determined that the terms "substantially" and "major" must be "interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled" under the ADA. Id. at 197. At issue in Toyota was [*59]  the major life activity of performing manual tasks, and the Court held "that to be substantially limited in performing manual tasks, an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives." Id. at 198. The Court further held that "[t]he impairment's impact must also be permanent or long term." Id.

2. The ADAAA.
Following and, at least in part, in response to Sutton and Toyota, Congress amended the ADA through the ADAAA, which took effect on January 1, 2009. Pub.L. No. 110-325, § 8, 122 Stat. 3553, 3559 (2008). In the ADAAA, Congress found that its expectation of how "the definition of disability under the ADA would be interpreted" had not been fulfilled. PL 110-325, §2(a)(3) (set forth as a note to 42 U.S.C. § 12101). More specifically, it found that the Supreme Court's holdings in Sutton and Toyota had "narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA." Id. at §§ 2(a)(4) & (5). "[I]n particular," Congress found that in Toyota, the Supreme Court "interpreted the term 'substantially limits' to require a greater degree of limitation than was intended by Congress." Id. at § 2(a)(7).
Congress declared that its purposes in enacting the ADAAA included "reinstating a broad [*60]  scope of protection" under the ADA; rejecting the holding of Sutton "that whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity is to be determined with reference to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures"; rejecting the reasoning of Sutton as to the third—"regarded as"—prong of the definition of disability and reinstating a broad view of the "regarded as" prong; and rejecting the strict standards set forth in Toyota that created "a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled." Id. at § 2(b)(1)-(4). Congress also declared that the purposes of the ADAAA include to convey its intent that Toyota had "created an inappropriately high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under the ADA," its intent that "the primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations," and its intent that "the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis." Id. at § 2(b)(5).
The ADAAA kept the three-prong definition of disability:
The term "disability" means, with respect to an individual-
(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits [*61]  one or more major life activities of such individual;
(B) a record of such an impairment; or
(C) being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3)).
42 U.S.C.A. § 12102(1). But whereas the ADA did not define "major life activities, the ADAAA specifies that "major life activities, include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." PL 110-325, §4 (codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A)). The ADAAA further specifies that "a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." Id. (codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B)).
The ADAAA also provides that an individual meets the regarded-as prong of the definition of disability "if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major [*62]  life activity." Id. (codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A)). But impairments that are transitory (i.e., "with an actual or expected duration of 6 months of less") and minor do not qualify under the regarded-as prong of the definition of disability. Id. (codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(B)). As relevant to Title II of the ADA, the ADAAA also provides that a public entity "need not provide a reasonable accommodation or a reasonable modification to policies, practices, or procedures to an individual who meets the definition of disability in section 12102(1) of this title solely under subparagraph (C) [the regarded-as prong] of such section." PL 110-325, § 6 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 12201(h)). In other words, "regarded as" plaintiffs are not entitled to reasonable accommodations.
Moreover, that ADAAA includes rules of construction regarding the definition of disability. Id. (codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)). Those rules include:
(A) The definition of disability in this chapter shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under this chapter, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter.
(B) The term "substantially limits" shall be interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008.
(C) An impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not limit [*63]  other major life activities in order to be considered a disability.
(D) An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.
Id. (codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A)-(D)). Those rules also provide that generally "[t]he determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures" except ordinary eyeglasses and contact lens. Id. (codified as 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(E)).

3. How 28 U.S.C. § 1658 is applied to causes of action under statutes amended after § 1658 was enacted.
In Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541 U.S. 369, 124 S. Ct. 1836, 158 L. Ed. 2d 645 (2004), the Supreme Court addressed the application of the four-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1658 to claims based on a statute that had been amended after § 1658 was enacted. In that case, former employees alleged hostile-work environment, wrongful termination, and other claims that arose in connection with the closing of the employer's plant. Id. at 372. They brought claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1981, which was originally enacted in 1866. Id. The "statutory right 'to make and enforce contracts'" as initially protected by §1981 "did not protect against harassing conduct that occurred after the formation of the contract." Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1981). Thus, the [*64]  plaintiffs' claims based on events that occurred after the formation of the employment contracts did "not state violations of the original version of § 1981." Id. But in 1991, Congress amended §1981 to include the "termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship." Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1981(b)) (footnote omitted). And the Supreme Court subsequently "recognized that the 1991 amendment 'enlarged the category of conduct that is subject to § 1981 liability.'" Id. at 383 (quoting Rivers v. Roadway Exp., Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 303, 114 S. Ct. 1510, 128 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1994)). The plaintiffs in Jones alleged violations of § 1981 as amended. Id.
"Like many federal statutes, 42 U.S.C. § 1981 does not contain a statute of limitations." Id. at 371. The issue in Jones was whether the plaintiffs' claims were subject to the four-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1658 or a borrowed state statute of limitations. Id.
The Court in Jones "observed that Congress' failure to enact a uniform statute of limitations applicable to federal causes of action created a 'void which is commonplace in federal statutory law.'" Id. at 377 (quoting Bd. of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y. v. Tomanio, 446 U.S. 478, 483, 100 S. Ct. 1790, 64 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1980)). Before Congress enacted § 1658, the "settled practice" was to borrow a state statute of limitations providing it was "not inconsistent with federal law or policy to do so." [*65]  Id. (quoting Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 267, 105 S. Ct. 1938, 85 L. Ed. 2d 254 (1985)). But that borrowing created a host of problems and "spawned a vast amount of litigation." Id. at 377-79. Congress responded to calls to eliminate those problems by enacting § 1658. Id. at 379-80.
The Court in Jones reasoned that "[t]he history that led to the enactment of § 1658 strongly supports an interpretation that fills more rather than less of the void that has created so much unnecessary work for federal judges." Id. at 380. It concluded that adopting a narrow view of § 1658 that restricts it "to cases in which the plaintiff's cause of action is based solely on a post-1990 statute that "'establishes a new cause of action without reference to preexisting law,'" would subvert that goal and would make § 1658 applicable to "only a small fraction of post-1990 enactments." Id. at 381 (quoting Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 305 F.3d 717, 727 (7th Cir. 2002) (in turn quoting Zubi v. AT&T Corp., 219 F.3d 220, 225 (3d Cir. 2000)). In that regard, the Court explained:
Congress routinely creates new rights of action by amending existing statutes, and "[a]ltering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms previously undefined, is a common way of amending statutes." Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 308, 114 S.Ct. 1510, 128 L.Ed.2d 274 (1994). Nothing in the text or history of § 1658 supports an interpretation that would limit its reach to entirely new sections of the United States Code. An amendment to an existing statute is [*66]  no less an "Act of Congress" than a new, stand-alone statute. What matters is the substantive effect of an enactment—the creation of new rights of action and corresponding liabilities not—the format in which it appears in the Code.
Id.
The Court also declined to give § 1658 "a narrow scope lest it disrupt litigants' settled expectations":
Concerns about settled expectations provide a valid reason to reject an interpretation of § 1658 under which any new amendment to federal law would suffice to trigger the 4—year statute of limitations, regardless of whether the plaintiff's claim would have been available—and subject to a state statute of limitations-prior to December 1, 1990. Such concerns do not, however, carry any weight against the reading of § 1658 adopted by the District Court and urged by petitioners, under which the catchall limitations period applies only to causes of action that were not available until after § 1658 was enacted. If a cause of action did not exist prior to 1990, potential litigants could not have formed settled expectations as to the relevant statute of limitations that would then be disrupted by application of § 1658.
Id. at 381-82 (italics in original).
The Court "conclude[d] that a cause of action 'aris[es] [*67]  under an Act of Congress enacted' after December 1, 1990—and therefore is governed by § 1658's 4—year statute of limitations—if the plaintiff's claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment." Id. at 382. According to the Court, "[t]hat construction best serves Congress' interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations while at the same time protecting settled interests." Id. And "[i]t spares federal judges and litigants the need to identify the appropriate state statute of limitations to apply to new claims but leaves in place the 'borrowed' limitations periods for pre-existing causes of action, with respect to which the difficult work already has been done." Id. "Interpreting § 1658 to apply whenever a post—1990 enactment creates a new right to maintain an action also is consistent with the common usage of the word 'arise' to mean 'come into being; originate' or 'spring up.'" Id. (footnotes omitted). "Finally, that construction is consistent with [the Court's] interpretations of the term 'arising under' as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction." Id. at 382-83.
Given its interpretation of § 1658, [*68]  the Court in Jones easily concluded that that the plaintiffs' claims in that case arose under the 1991 amendments to § 1981, and, thus, were subject to the four-year statute of limitations set forth in § 1658. Id. at 383-84. The Court also concluded that any difficulties in determining whether a claim arose under the original or an amended version of a statute would be minimal:
We are not persuaded that any "guess work," 305 F.3d, at 725, is required to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the relevant statute as it stood prior to December 1, 1990, or whether her claims necessarily depend on a subsequent amendment. Courts routinely make such determinations when dealing with amendments (such as the 1991 amendment to § 1981) that do not apply retroactively. In any event, such hypothetical problems pale in comparison with the difficulties that federal courts faced for decades in trying to answer all the questions raised by borrowing appropriate limitations rules from state statutes.
Id. at 384-85 (footnote omitted). The Court noted that it is "hardly beyond the judicial ken" for courts to "determine whether [an] amendment clarified existing law or created a new right and liabilities" as "Courts must answer precisely the same [*69]  question when deciding whether an amendment may be applied retrospectively." Id. at 384 n.18. And "[t]he substantial overlap between the retroactivity and statute-of-limitations inquiries undermines respondent's claim that application of § 1658 to post-1991 amendments will generate additional work for federal judges." Id.

4. Because the ADAAA did not make Snider's claims possible, the four-year statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. § 1658 does not apply; rather, the two-year Pennsylvania statute of limitations applies.
In this case, whether the two-year Pennsylvania statute of limitations identified in Disabled in Action, 539 F.3d at 208, or the four-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1658 applies depends on whether the amendments of the ADA set forth in the ADAAA made Snider's claims possible.
Reasoning that the ADAAA did not amend sections 12132 (Discrimination) and 12133 (Enforcement) of the ADA, under which Snider brings his claims, the CCCF argues that Snider's claims were not made possible by the ADAAA. Snider responds that the ADAAA amended § 12102 of the ADA, which sets forth the definition of disability, and he contends that his claims were made possible by the changes made by the ADAAA. More specifically, pointing to the rules of construction enacted by the ADAAA that provide [*70]  that "[a]n impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active" and that generally "[t]he determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures," 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(D)-(E), Snider contends that these amendments made his claims possible and that "but for the changes enacted by the ADAAA, [he] would not be able to bring an ADA claim." Id. at 8.9
Snider asserts that "the frequently episodic nature" of "serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder" led "many courts to decide that these impairments were not 'substantially limiting' for the purposes of the ADA prior to the amendments" made by the ADAAA. Doc. 282 at 5. He also asserts that "Sutton's progeny further eliminated coverage under the ADA for individuals with psychiatric disabilities by considering only whether an individual was substantially limited in major life activities when properly medicated." Id. at 7. And he cites cases decided before the ADAAA was in effect, where courts held that the mental conditions at issue were not disabilities under the ADA. [*71]  See e.g. Hamilton v. Sweetin, No. CIV.A. 9:08-CV-125, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12536, 2009 WL 399113, at *8 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 13, 2009) (concluding that the plaintiff failed to state an ADA claim upon which relief may be granted where he claimed that he is schizophrenic and manic/depressive because "[s]uch mental conditions were not disabilities for purposes of" the ADA and Rehabilitation Act); Crook v. Paul D. Borman Fitness USA Corp., No. 04-74289, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7585, at *10-11 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 28, 2006) (concluding that because the "Plaintiff's schizophrenia was controlled by medication during her employment with Defendant, and did not substantially impair a major life activity, Plaintiff's schizophrenia itself does not constitute a disability under the ADA," but concluding the Plaintiff met the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability); Hayes v. Philadelphia Water Dep't, No. CIV.A. 03-6013, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41852, 2005 WL 745857, at *8 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2005) (citing Sutton and concluding that the plaintiff, who suffered from schizophrenia but who testified that "her mental illness does not substantially limit any of her major life activities so long as she takes her medication," was not disabled); Johnson v. Maynard, No. 01 CIV. 7393 (AKH), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2676, 2003 WL 548754, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2003) (concluding that the plaintiff, who had paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar illness, was not disabled since she could function normally if she took her medication and "she cannot be said to have been substantially impaired if she neglected to avail herself of such corrective measures"); [*72]  Herschaft v. New York Bd. of Elections, No. 00 CV 2748 (CBA), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11801, 2001 WL 940923, at *3-4 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2001) (concluding that the plaintiff, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, paranoid type, who suffered "sporadic lapses in his ability to care for himself," and who "takes prescribed medication to control the effects of his schizophrenia," was not substantially limited with respect to a major life activity), aff'd, 37 F. App'x 17, 18 (2d Cir. 2002) ("The plaintiff's ADA claim fails because the plaintiff has not shown that his socialization problems and sporadic lapses in his ability to care for himself constitute substantial limitations.").
The CCCF responds that "[p]roof of an impairment alone has always been and still is insufficient to establish a claim under the ADA." Doc. 284 at 2. While there is no doubt that the ADAAA made it easier to establish that a plaintiff has a disability,10 even before the ADAAA, courts had concluded that mental impairments may qualify as disabilities under the ADA. See e.g. Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 589 n.2, 593, 119 S. Ct. 2176, 144 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1999) (noting that there was no dispute that the plaintiffs, who were mentally retarded and one whom had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and the other with a personality disorder, were disabled with the meaning of the ADA); Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 766 (3d Cir. 2004) (reversing grant of summary judgment to the defendant and holding—after Sutton and Toyota—that [*73]  a reasonable jury could conclude that Williams, who suffered from major depression, was disabled under the ADA); Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 302, 307 (3d Cir. 1999) (accepting that thinking is a major life activity and concluding—after Sutton—that there were "genuine factual disputes requiring a trial on whether Taylor's bipolar disorder substantially limits a major life activity while she is taking" medication); cf Verzeni v. Potter, 109 F. App'x 485, 487-88 (3d Cir. 2004) (addressing the discrimination prong of a claim under the Rehabilitation Act,[11] but observing that the District Court had ruled as a matter of law that Verzeni, who suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia, had a disability).
In Cordova v. Univ. of Notre Dame Du Lac, 936 F. Supp. 2d 1003, 1009 (N.D. Ind. 2013), the court held that a plaintiff who alleged that she had a cognitive learning disability "and a psychological disability that results in 'periods of severe depression and anxiety,'" who alleged that she was "substantially limited in the major life activities of learning, thinking, concentrating, reading, and sleeping," and who alleged that "Notre Dame discriminated against her because of these disabilities" "alleged a violation of the ADA as originally enacted as well as a violation of the recently amended ADAAA." The court thus held that the borrowed state statute of limitations, rather than 28 U.S.C. § 1658, applied:
A learning disability that substantially [*75]  limits a person's ability to learn, think, and concentrate (activities of central importance to daily life) is precisely the type of disability the ADA has always sought to protect. See e.g. DePaoli v. Abbott Labs., 140 F.3d 668, 671 (7th Cir.1998) (citing to EEOC regulations at 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2 to define mental impairment as one which includes "specific learning disabilities" and major life activities as those which include functions such as "learning"); Duda, 133 F.3d at 1058-59 (citing to the same regulations and finding that plaintiff had sufficiently alleged mental disability); see also 45 C.F.R. § 84.3 (HEW regulations defining mental impairment as "any mental or psychological disorder, such as ... emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities"). Similarly, a psychological disability that substantially limits learning, thinking, concentrating, reading, and sleeping is also a disability that has been deserving of protection under both the ADA and the ADAAA. Cordova argues that prior to the passage of the ADAAA, Seventh Circuit case law held that "isolated bouts" of depression did not constitute disabilities. See Brunker v. Schwan's Home Serv., Inc., 583 F.3d 1004, 1008 (7th Cir.2009); Kinney v. Century Services Corp. II, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87996, 2011 WL 3476569, *10 (S.D.Ind. Aug. 9, 2011). While technically accurate, the Seventh Circuit has also held that "[m]ajor depression can constitute a disability under the ADA." Ogborn v. United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local No. 881, 305 F.3d 763, 767 (7th Cir.2002) (collecting cases). Here, [*76]  Cordova alleges a psychological disability that results in "periods of severe depression and anxiety" and substantially limits her various life activities. She does not allege that her psychological disability was "isolated" or in remission. Taking her at her word and relying on the facts as stated in the complaint, Cordova has alleged disability-based discrimination claims that would have been actionable under the original terms and provisions of the ADA; her claims were not created by the recent amendments which simply clarified the existing statute by restoring its original intent and broad scope. Thus, Cordova's claims are subject to Indiana's two-year statute of limitations period for personal injury actions.
Id. at 1009-10 (footnote omitted). Here, like the claims in Cordova, Snider's claims were not made possible by the ADAAA because, as set forth earlier, even before the ADAAA, mental impairments like Snider's could rise to the level of disabilities under the ADA. See also Toma v. University of Hawaii, No. CV 16-00499 RLP, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175419, 2017 WL 4782629, at *4 (D. Haw. Oct. 23, 2017) (rejecting the plaintiff's argument (in connection with a motion for judgment on the pleadings) that § 1658 applied where the plaintiff, who suffered depression, did not allege that his [*77]  depression was episodic "or that medication ameliorated his symptoms" but granting the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint); Lei Ke v. Drexel Univ., No. CIV.A. 11-6708, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143686, 2013 WL 5508672, at *6, *6 n.5 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 4, 2013) (concluding that the "ADAAA did not create a new ground of disability for a vision impairment" and "[b]ecause no new applicable disability was created by the ADAAA in this case, the two year statute of limitations under Pennsylvania tort law and the ADA governs Plaintiff's claim" and rejecting the plaintiff's attempt to infer from a case that held that a vision impairment did not rise to the level of a disability "that he too would not have been considered disabled under the ADA").
Snider cites Mercado v. Puerto Rico, 814 F.3d 581 (1st Cir. 2016), in support of his contention that § 1658 applies to his ADA claims. In Mercado, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the four-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1658 applied to Mercado's Title II ADA claims that the defendants denied her access to services and discriminated against her because they regarded her has disabled within the meaning of the ADA. Id. at 583. The First Circuit explained that the ADAAA substantively changed "regarded-as" claims:
[T]he 2008 amendments codified in the ADAAA made [*78]  the ADA's definition of being "regarded as" having an impairment substantively broader than that definition had been in the period after Sutton. During that period, a plaintiff could maintain an ADA claim based on being regarded as having an impairment only if she pleaded that she was regarded as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities. See Sutton, 527 U.S. at 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139. After the enactment of the ADAAA, however, a plaintiff bringing a "regarded as" claim under the ADA needs to plead and prove only that she was regarded as having a physical or mental impairment. Such a plaintiff no longer needs to plead and prove that such impairment substantially limited one or more major life activities. Pub. L. No. 110-325, sec. 4, § 3 (3)(A). Thus, while the change made to the ADA by the ADAAA may not be as significant as the change made by the amendment to section 1981 at issue in Jones, the change is still one that had a substantive effect.
Id. at 588. It also explained that Mercado's "regarded-as" claims necessarily depended on the ADAAA and, thus, were made possible by the ADAAA:
Mercado's complaint expressly refers to the 2008 amendments in pleading her "regarded as" claims. By "enlarg[ing] the category of conduct [*79]  that is subject to [ ] liability," id. at 383, 124 S.Ct. 1836, those amendments permit Mercado to plead and prove one fewer element of her "regarded as" claims than she would have been required to plead and prove under the ADA as it existed prior to those amendments. By virtue of those liability-enlarging amendments, Mercado need not plead and prove that the defendants regarded her as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited a major life activity. She need plead and prove only that the defendants regarded her as having a physical or mental impairment, no matter the defendants' view of the magnitude of the effect of the perceived impairment on her life activities.
For that reason, Mercado's legal claims "necessarily depend" on the 2008 amendments. See id. at 384, 124 S.Ct. 1836. Accordingly, her claims "aris[e] under" an Act of Congress passed after December 1, 1990. See 28 U.S.C. § 1658.
Id. at 588-89. According to the court, it was clear that the ADAAA had a substantive effect in that case because the ADAAA "clearly created new rights and liabilities," and Mercado's claims necessarily depended on "the expanded liability" created by the ADAAA. Id. at 589. The court observed that the ADAAA '"made possible' the particular legal claims that Mercado has [*80]  brought, even if her complaint also contains factual allegations that perhaps could have supported the different and harder-to-prove "regarded as" claim that existed prior to the 2008 amendments but that Congress has replaced and that she is not now bringing." Id. at 590 (footnote omitted). In other words, according to the court, "an amendment to a statute that bars a new, broader form of discrimination may still 'ma[ke] possible' a plaintiff's suit to redress that discrimination, even if it may be true that the plaintiff has also suffered a different, more specific form of discrimination that the unamended statute already barred." Id.
Here, we do not construe Snider's second amended complaint as raising "regarded as" claims.12 Thus, the provisions of the ADAAA at issue in Mercado that substantively changed what must be established in the context of "regarded as" claims are not applicable here. And so Mercado does not persuade us that in our case, Snider's claims were made possible by the ADAAA.
Snider also relies on a couple of other cases to support his argument that § 1658 applies to his claims. See Rohr v. Crime Victims Comp. Comm'n of Hawaii, No. CV 16-00162 LEK-KSC, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28253, 2017 WL 776106, at *4 (D. Haw. Feb. 28, 2017) (concluding that because to determine which [*81]  statute of limitations applies, the court must make findings of fact as to Andrews's alleged disability, that issue was not appropriately decided on a motion to dismiss, but observing that the plaintiff presented "a plausible argument that the four-year statute of limitations period pursuant to § 1658 may apply to her claim because Andrews may have been a person with disabilities under the ADAAA, but he may not have been under the ADA and the case law interpreting it prior to the ADAAA" where it was alleged that Andrews "had preexisting psychiatric impairment for which he was prescribed medication—reoccurring major depression or bipolar disorder and anxiety, diagnosed by his treating psychiatrist" and it was alleged that "[m]ajor depressive mood disorders are reoccurring or episodic in nature and can be controlled with medication"); Dickinson v. Univ. of N. Carolina, 91 F. Supp. 3d 755, 766 (M.D.N.C. 2015) (denying Fed.R.Civ.P 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on the basis of the statute of limitations and concluding that the four-year statute of limitations of 28 U.S.C. § 1658 applied given that the defendants did "not attempt to explain how Dickinson's claims would have been viable under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act as they existed before the ADAAA, and it is not entirely clear that they would have [*82]  been" given that "[i]n her complaint, Dickinson alleges that she suffers from 'severe migraine headaches and a disorder known as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome or PCOS, both of which are completely disabling" and "[w]hen symptomatic, the illnesses substantially limit major functions").
Here, unlike in Rohr and Dickinson, we are not addressing a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Further, unlike in Dickinson, the defendant here does explain how Snider's claims would have been viable under the ADA before the ADAAA. And, unlike in Rohr, Snider has not alleged that his impairments were episodic or controlled with medication.
In his second amended complaint, Snider does not allege that his Schizophrenia or depression was episodic or controlled with medication. Rather, he alleges that he "is an individual with a serious mental illness, depression and chronic paranoid schizophrenia," that his "mental illness adversely affects nearly every aspect of his daily life, including his ability to care for himself and other major life activities such as sleeping, learning, concentrating, thinking and communicating," that "[t]hroughout his incarceration at CCCF, [he] struggled with his mental illness, continuing to hear [*83]  voices and experience delusions despite repeated increased to his medication," and that he "would frequently act out as a result of his mental illness." Doc. 222 at ¶¶ 20, 21, 23, & 24. He further alleges that in February of 2013, his "psychiatrist increased his medications in an effort to combat the symptoms of his illness," and that in April of 2013, his psychiatrist "documented that [he] was continuing to complain of difficulties with voices and hallucinations as well as feeling that his victim was taking over control of his body," noted that he "was experiencing depersonalization, derealization and symptoms of probable Post Traumatic Stress Disorder," and "added a prescription of Risperdal, a powerful anti-psychotic, to the medications he was already taking." Id. at ¶¶ 28, & 50-52. Snider alleges that in June of 2013, at the State Correctional Institution at Coal Township, he attempted suicide, "was resuscitated, hospitalized and subsequently committed to a mental health hospital for a number of months." Id. at ¶¶ 121-22. Snider further alleges that he "is a qualified individual with a disability, serious mental illness which substantially limits many of his major life activities," [*84]  and the CCCF "discriminated against [him] and failed to provide him with reasonable accommodations for his disability, causing him to be excluded from participation in programs and denied services of a public entity in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act." Id. at ¶¶ 132-33. Snider alleges a violation of the ADA as originally enacted.
And Snider has not presented evidence that his conditions were episodic or controlled with medication. Because Snider brings claims that would have been cognizable under the ADA before the ADAAA, his claims were not made possible or created by the ADAAA. Thus, the four-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1658 is not applicable. Rather, the Pennsylvania two-year statute of limitations applies to Snider's ADA claims. See Disabled in Action, 539 F.3d at 208.

5. Snider's ADA claims are barred by the two-year statute of limitations.
The events at issue in this case arose in February and April of 2013. But Snider did not file his second amended complaint, which raised his ADA claims for the first time, until December 19, 2015, more than two years after the events at issue in this case arose.

a. Accrual.
Generally, a statute of limitations "begin[s] to run 'when the cause [*85]  of action accrues'—that is, 'when the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.'" California Pub. Employees' Ret. Sys. v. ANZ Sec., Inc., 137 S. Ct. 2042, 2049, 198 L. Ed. 2d 584 (2017) (quoting CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 134 S. Ct. 2175, 2182, 189 L. Ed. 2d 62 (2014)). Even when a statute of limitations is borrowed from state law, however, federal law governs "what constitutes accrual." Dique v. New Jersey State Police, 603 F.3d 181, 185 (3d Cir. 2010). A cause of action '"accrues, and the statute of limitations commences to run, when the wrongful act or omission results in damages.'" Id. at 185-86 (quoting Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 391, 127 S. Ct. 1091, 166 L. Ed. 2d 973 (2007)). In other words, the cause of action accrues "when the plaintiff has 'a complete and present cause of action,' that is, when 'the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.'" Wallace, 549 U.S. at 388 (citations omitted). Thus, "[u]nder federal law, a cause of action accrues '"'when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which the action is based.''" Montanez v. Sec'y Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr., 773 F.3d 472, 480 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Kach v. Hose, 589 F.3d 626, 634 (3d Cir. 2009), in turn quoting Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia, 142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998)). "The determination of the time at which a claim accrues is an objective inquiry; we ask not what the plaintiff actually knew but what a reasonable person should have known." Kach, 589 F.3d at 634.
Here, Snider's ADA claims are based on the use of force and on disciplinary proceedings that occurred in February and April of 2013, and Snider was transferred from the CCCF on May 7, 2013. Thus, Snider's claims accrued at the latest on May 7, 2013. Snider does not argue that his claims [*86]  did not accrue at the time of the events. Rather, he argues that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled.

b. Tolling.
Unless inconsistent with federal law, state law governs whether the statute of limitations should be tolled. Dique, 603 F.3d at 185. "Pennsylvania law recognizes that 'in some circumstances, although the right to institute suit may arise, a party may not, despite the exercise of diligence, reasonably discover that he has been injured.'" Haugh v. Allstate Ins. Co., 322 F.3d 227, 231 (3d Cir. 2003) (quoting Crouse v. Cyclops Industries, 560 Pa. 394, 745 A.2d 606, 611 (Pa. 2000)). Under Pennsylvania law, the statute of limitations may be tolled by the discovery rule. Mest v. Cabot Corp., 449 F.3d 502, 510 (3d Cir. 2006). "The discovery rule 'tolls the statute of limitations during the plaintiff's complete inability, due to facts and circumstances not within his control, to discover an injury despite the exercise of due diligence.'" Blanyar v. Genova Prods., 861 F.3d 426, 431-32 (3d Cir. 2017) (italics in original) (quoting Barnes v. Am. Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 152 (3d Cir. 1998). "Under the rule, even if a plaintiff suffers an injury, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until 'the plaintiff knows, or reasonably should know, (1) that he has been injured, and (2) that his injury has been caused by another party's conduct.'" Id. (quoting Debiec v. Cabot Corp., 352 F.3d 117, 129 (3d Cir. 2003)). But "[f]or the statute of limitations to run, a plaintiff need not know the 'exact nature' of his injury, as long as it objectively [*87]  appears that the plaintiff 'is reasonably charged with the knowledge that he has an injury caused by another.'" Id. at 510-11 (quoting Ackler v. Raymark Indus., Inc.,380 Pa. Super. 183, 551 A.2d 291, 293 (Pa.Super.Ct. 1988)); see also Brawner v. Educ. Mgmt. Corp., 513 F. App'x 148, 151 (3d Cir. 2013) (stating that knowledge of every fact necessary to succeed on a claim is not required to trigger the accrual period). '"[W]hile reasonable diligence is an objective test, it is sufficiently flexible to take into account the differences between persons and their capacity to meet certain situations and the circumstances confronting them at the time in question.'" Miller v. Philadelphia Geriatric Ctr., 463 F.3d 266, 276 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting Fine v. Checcio, 582 Pa. 253, 870 A.2d 850, 858 (Pa. 2005)). "Ultimately, 'the salient point giving rise to [the discovery rule's] application is the inability of the injured, despite the exercise of reasonable diligence, to know that he is injured and by what cause.'" Blanyar, 861 F.3d at 432 (quoting Fine, 870 A.2d at 858). Snider does not invoke the discovery rule, and there is no basis to assume that he was not aware that he was injured at the time of use of force and disciplinary proceedings.
Snider argues that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled. He contends that the statute of limitations should be equitable tolled because of his mental condition and during the time that his numerous motions for the appointment of counsel were pending. As set forth above, unless [*88]  inconsistent with federal law, state law governs whether the statute of limitations should be tolled. Dique, 603 F.3d at 185. Snider does not argue that Pennsylvania law is inconsistent with federal law. Thus, we apply Pennsylvania tolling principles.
Under Pennsylvania law, the statute of limitations is not tolled merely because the plaintiff is in prison or mentally incompetent. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 5533(a) ("Except as otherwise provided by statute, insanity or imprisonment does not extend the time limited by this subchapter for the commencement of a matter."); Kreider v. Philhaven Adolescent Inpatient Treatment Ctr., 592 F. App'x 59, 61 (3d Cir. 2014) ("Pennsylvania does not toll the statute of limitations for mental incompetence."). Further, other than the discovery rule, "[i]n Pennsylvania, judicial extensions of the statute of limitations are expressly forbidden absent fraud or its equivalent." Poole v. Marks, 441 F. App'x 854, 857 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. § 5504(a) and Aivazoglou v. Drever Furnaces, 418 Pa. Super. 111, 613 A.2d 595, 598 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1992)). Because Snider does not assert fraud or its equivalent, he is not entitled to equitable tolling under Pennsylvania law.
Moreover, even if we applied the federal standard for equitable tolling, equitable tolling would not save Snider's ADA claims from being barred by the statute of limitations. "Under the more lenient federal standard, which applies when use of the state court's rules would be contrary to federal [*89]  law, '[e]quitable tolling is appropriate in three general scenarios: (1) where a defendant actively misleads a plaintiff with respect to her cause of action; (2) where the plaintiff has been prevented from asserting her claim as a result of other extraordinary circumstances; or (3) where the plaintiff asserts her claims in a timely manner but has done so in the wrong forum." Poole, 441 F. App'x at 857 (quoting Lake v. Arnold, 232 F.3d 360, 370, n.9 (3d Cir. 2000)). Further, to qualify for equitable tolling, a party must also have exercised due diligence in pursuing and preserving his claim. Omar v. Blackman, 590 F. App'x 162, 166 (3d Cir. 2014).
Here, even if the federal equitable tolling standards applied, Snider ADA claims would not be saved by equitable tolling based on his mental condition. Under federal tolling principals, "mental incompetence is not a per se reason to toll a statute of limitations." Nara v. Frank, 264 F.3d 310, 320 (3d Cir. 2001) (italics in original), overruled on other grounds, Carey v. Saffold, 536 U.S. 214, 122 S. Ct. 2134, 153 L. Ed. 2d 260 (2002). Rather, "[f]or tolling to be appropriate, 'the alleged mental incompetence must somehow have affected the petitioner's ability to file' a timely action." Champney v. Sec'y Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr., 469 F. App'x 113, 117 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting Nara, 264 F.3d at 320). "A mental condition which burdens but does not prevent a petitioner from meeting timely filing requirements does not constitute 'extraordinary circumstances' for the purposes of equitable tolling." [*90]  Martin v. Giroux, No. 11-CV-6229, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103530, 2013 WL 3819431, at *3 (E.D. Pa. July 23, 2013). To determine whether extraordinary circumstances exist, courts consider a "non-exclusive list of factors":
(1) [whether] the petitioner [was] adjudicated incompetent and, if so, when did the adjudication occur in relation to the habeas statutory period; (2) [whether] the petitioner [was] institutionalized for his mental impairment; (3) [whether] the petitioner handled or assisted in other legal matters which required action during the federal limitations period; and (4) [whether] the petitioner supported his allegations of impairment with extrinsic evidence such as evaluations and/or medications.
Id. at 118 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting Passmore v. Pennsylvania, No. CIV.A.1:08-CV-0705, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47793, 2008 WL 2518108, at *3 (M.D. Pa. June 19, 2008)).
Here, there is no evidence that Snider was adjudicated incompetent. And he was able to file numerous documents including a complaint and an amended complaint within the statute of limitations, which cuts against concluding that his mental condition was an extraordinary circumstance justifying equitable tolling. See Champney, 469 F. App'x at 117 (concluding that "Champney's history of timely filing documents in court sufficient to negate the premise that his mental status constituted an 'extraordinary circumstance' that impaired his ability to timely file the [*91]  instant Petition"); Cf Brown v. Shannon, 322 F.3d 768, 774 (3d Cir. 2003) (rejecting Brown's contention that he was entitled to equitable tolling based on his attorney's advice and observing that "[g]iven his history of pro se filings, there is no reason to believe that Brown could not prepare and submit a notice of appeal, a simple one-paragraph document, within [the applicable] time").
Snider has presented a copy of a sentencing memorandum prepared by his criminal counsel that recites that he was at the Mental Health Unit (MHU) at SCI-Graterford from June 13, 2013, to June 26, 2013, and that he was at the Torrance State Hospital Regional Forensic Psychiatry Center (where he was found competent to stand trial) from August 14, 2013, until sometime in October of 2013. See Doc. 282-2 at 2. Snider has not, however, presented any argument for why the court should consider such an unsworn or unverified memorandum in connection with a summary judgment motion. But even considering such, Snider was only at the MHU for 14 days and at the Torrance State Hospital for, at most, 79 days.13 Thus, at most, he could be considered to have been institutionalized for his mental condition for 93 days. But his second amended complaint, which was filed on [*92]  December 19, 2015, was filed more than 93 days after the statute of limitations ran on, at the latest, May 7, 2015. Accordingly, even assuming that federal equitable tolling principles applied, tolling based on Snider's mental condition would not save his ADA claims from being barred by the statute of limitations.
Snider also contends that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled during the time that his numerous motions for the appointment of counsel were pending. In Baldwin Cty. Welcome Ctr. v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 149, 104 S. Ct. 1723, 80 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1984), a Title VII case, the plaintiff filed a right-to-sue letter within the 90-day statute of limitations along with a motion for the appointment of counsel. The Supreme Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's decision holding that in a Title VII action the filing of a right-to-sue letter tolled the statute of limitations. Id. The Court held the right-to-sue letter did not properly commence the action, and there was nothing in the record calling for the application of equitable tolling. Id. at 150-51. In so holding, the Court observed:
This is not a case in which a claimant has received inadequate notice, see Gates v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 492 F.2d 292 (CA9 1974); or where a motion for appointment of counsel is pending and equity would justify tolling the statutory [*93]  period until the motion is acted upon, see Harris v. Walgreen's Distribution Center, 456 F.2d 588 (CA6 1972); or where the court has led the plaintiff to believe that she had done everything required of her, see Carlile v. South Routt School District RE 3-J, 652 F.2d 981 (CA10 1981). Nor is this a case where affirmative misconduct on the part of a defendant lulled the plaintiff into inaction. See Villasenor v. Lockheed Aircraft, Corp., 640 F.2d 207 (CA9 1981); Wilkerson v. Siegfried Insurance Agency, Inc., 621 F.2d 1042 (CA10 1980); Leake v. University of Cincinnati, 605 F.2d 255 (CA6 1979).
Id. at 151. Although the Court in Baldwin Cty. held that there was no basis for equitable tolling in that case, it is often cited for the proposition that equitable tolling may be appropriate where a motion for the appointment of counsel is pending. See e.g. Seitzinger v. Reading Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 165 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (citing Baldwin Cty. for the proposition that "[t]he Supreme Court has held that equitable tolling may be appropriate when a claimant received inadequate notice of her right to file suit, where a motion for appointment of counsel is pending, or where the court has misled the plaintiff into believing that she had done everything required of her"); Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 159 (3d Cir. 1999) (citing Seitzinger for the proposition that equitable tolling may be appropriate where a motion for appointment of counsel is pending). But while frequently cited as a possible basis for equitable tolling, the fact that a motion for appointment of counsel was pending is not frequently found [*94]  to actually be a basis for equitable tolling. But see Brown v. J.I. Case Co., 756 F.2d 48, 50 (7th Cir. 1985) (holding that "[t]he remedial purpose of Title VII and the special equitable circumstances raised by a request for appointment of counsel justify a general rule allowing a request for appointed counsel combined with presentation of a Notice of Right-to-Sue to toll the running of the ninety-day period until the court acts upon the counsel request"). And when it is, it appears that the basis for so holding is that "the plaintiff did not present a complaint for filing, but submitted certain preliminary documents to the court clerk along with a request for appointed counsel." Jarrett v. US Sprint Commc'ns Co., 22 F.3d 256, 261 (10th Cir. 1994) (citing cases). "In other words, the plaintiffs in those cases did not demonstrate the present ability to commence a lawsuit by filing a complaint, as Rule 3 requires," and "[t]he courts which rendered the cited decisions, as a matter of equity, chose to rule that the request for counsel tolled the limitation period until a ruling was made, in order to enable proper filing of a formal complaint." Id.
Here, however, Snider was able to file a complaint within the statute of limitations. Thus, there is no basis to toll the statute of limitations during the time that his [*95]  motions for the appointment counsel were pending. After all, a pending motion for the appointment of counsel in a prisoner civil rights case is a completely ordinary, not an extraordinary, circumstance.
CCCF also anticipated that Snider would raise the relation-back doctrine. The relation-back doctrine "refers to the operation of Rule 15(c), which allows certain new claims and new parties added in an amended complaint to 'relate back' to the date of filing of the original complaint for statute of limitations purposes if certain conditions are met." Mullin v. Balicki, 875 F.3d 140, 2017 WL 5077954, at *12 (3d Cir. Nov. 6, 2017) (footnote omitted). CCCF anticipated that Snider might argue that his ADA claims are not barred by the statute of limitations because they relate back to the original complaint, which was filed on May 6, 2013—only a few months after the events at issue. Snider has not, however, raised the relation-back doctrine. Snider does, however, assert that his second amended complaint was not the first time that he raised the possibility of an ADA claim. He points to the "Proposed amendments to Civil Complaint," which he filed on January 7, 2015. See Doc. 99 and 103. Those proposed amendments, however, were filed with motions for leave to amend that the court [*96]  denied because the proposed amendments failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 20 given that Snider was seeking to add more than 60 defendants to the action, "[a]nd, while the amended complaint, which is the operative complaint in this case, names defendants from and concerns events at the CCCF, in Snider's proposed amendments he names defendants from and complains of events and conditions at four other correctional facilities—the Snyder County Prison, SCI-Coal Township, SCI-Camp Hill, and SCI-Greene—as well as the CCCF." Doc. 141 at 8-9. Moreover, while the proposed amendments did mention the ADA, the first of those proposed amendments—doc. 99—did not mention the ADA in connection with the CCCF. Rather, given that context of where Snider sought to add the paragraphs that mentioned the ADA into his amended complaint, it appears that the reference to the ADA applied to events that happened after Snider was transferred from the CCCF. See Doc. 99 at 30 (seeking to add paragraphs before paragraph 52 of his amended complaint (doc. 61)) and Doc. 99 at 39-40 (paragraphs mentioning the ADA). Further, in this proposed amendment, the only defendant against whom Snider sought to include a claim under the ADA was [*97]  John Wetzel, the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. See Doc. 99 at 49, ¶ 15. As to the second of the proposed amendments to which Snider points, that document sought to add claims concerning events that happened after Snider had been transferred from the CCCF and that occurred while he was in the custody of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. See Doc. 103. Thus, although Snider mentioned the ADA in his proposed amendments, he did not seek to add claims under the ADA against the CCCF.
Snider also seems to suggest that the statute of limitations should be tolled based on certain orders of the court. Pointing to Orders dated March 9, 2015, and July 13, 2015, Snider asserts that "the Court stayed discovery, briefing on pending motions and ultimately the case in its entirety." Doc. 282 at 11. But this assertion is factually incorrect. While we stayed discovery and briefing on the pending motions to dismiss the complaint pending the search for counsel, we did not stay the entire case. See Docs 141 (Order of March 9, 2015) and 176 (Order of July 13, 2015). Thus, to extent that Snider is suggesting that a court stay prevented him from timely amending his complaint [*98]  to plead an ADA claim against the CCCF, that suggestion is without merit.
In sum, Snider is not entitled to equitable tolling, and his claims are barred by the statute of limitations. Given that conclusion, we need not, and do not, address the CCCF's other arguments for why Snider should not be granted summary judgment as to his ADA claims.

VI. CCCF's Motion for Summary Judgment.
CCCF argued that Snider was not entitled to summary judgment as to the ADA claim because of the statute of limitations, but it did not argue that it was entitled to summary judgment based on the statute of limitations. Our October 12th Order provided Snider notice that the Court would consider whether the CCCF was entitled to summary judgment based on the statute of limitations, and that Order gave Snider an opportunity to respond to the statute of limitations argument:
The Clinton County Correctional Facility raised the statute of limitations in opposition to Snider's motion for summary judgment, but it did not raise the statute of limitations in its own motion for summary judgment. "District courts 'possess the power to enter summary judgments sua sponte, so long as the losing party was on notice that she had [*99]  to come forward with all of her evidence.'" In re SemCrude L.P., 864 F.3d 280, 296 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Anderson v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp., 621 F.3d 261, 280 (3d Cir. 2010)). '"Notice' simply requires that 'the targeted party ha[ve] reason to believe the court might reach the issue and receive[ ] a fair opportunity to put its best foot forward.'" Id. (quoting Couden v. Duffy, 446 F.3d 483, 500 (3d Cir. 2006). If the statute of limitations bars Snider's ADA claim, then in addition to Snider not being entitled to summary judgment in his favor as to that claim, the Clinton County Correctional Facility would be entitled to summary judgment in its favor as to that claim. This Order provides Snider notice that the Court will sua sponte consider entering summary judgment in favor of the Clinton County Correctional Facility based on the statute of limitations, and the reply brief is Snider's opportunity to address the issue.
Doc. 281 at 2 n.1.
Because, as discussed above, the statute of limitations bars Snider's ADA claims, we recommend that the Court grant the CCCF's motion for summary judgment.
VII. Recommendations.
Based on the foregoing, we recommend that the Court grant in part and deny in part Nurses Andrus and Rupert's motion (doc. 255) for summary judgment. We recommend that the Court grant summary judgment in favor of Nurse Andrus as to the claim regarding [*100]  the medical care provided after the February 28, 2013 incident. We recommend that the Court deny Nurses Andrus and Rupert's motion for summary judgment in all other respects.
We also recommend that the Court deny Snider's motion (doc. 262) for partial summary judgment.
We further recommend that the Court grant the CCCF's motion (doc. 258) for summary judgment.
Finally, we recommend that the case be listed for trial on the remaining claims, which if the Court adopts this Report and Recommendation, are the use-of-force claims in Counts I-III the second amended complaint; and the denial-of-medical care claim against defendant Rupert based on the February 28, 2013 incident, and the denial of medical care claims against defendants Rupert and Andrus based on the April 5, 2013 incident in Count IV of the second amended complaint.
The Parties are further placed on notice that pursuant to Local Rule 72.3:
Any party may object to a magistrate judge's proposed findings, recommendations or report addressing a motion or matter described in 28 U.S.C. 636 (b)(1)(B) or making a recommendation for the disposition of a prisoner case or a habeas corpus petition within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy [*101]  thereof. Such party shall file with the clerk of court, and serve on the magistrate judge and all parties, written objections which shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings, recommendations or report to which objection is made and the basis for such objections. The briefing requirements set forth in Local Rule 72.2 shall apply. A judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made and may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge, however, need conduct a new hearing only in his or her discretion or where required by law, and may consider the record developed before the magistrate judge, making his or her own determination on the basis of that record. The judge may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.
