CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: (IN CHAMBERS) Order Re: Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 31]

I. INTRODUCTION
On November 6, 2019, James Mack ("Plaintiff') filed a Complaint against Universal Truckload, LLC, Universal Truckload, Inc. (collectively, "Universal" or "Defendants") and Kyle Mundie. The Complaint contained eight claims. The first five claims allege various violations of California's Fair Housing and Employment Act ("FEHA"): (1) disability discrimination; (2) failure to engage in good faith interactive process; (3) failure to accommodate; (4) retaliation; and (5) failure to take reasonable steps to prevent discrimination/retaliation. The sixth and seventh claims are based on the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"): (6) violation of CFRA and (7) retaliation in violation of CFRA. The final claim is for (8) wrongful termination in violation of public policy based on FEHA and Article 1, Section 8 of the California Constitution. On November 2, 2020, all parties stipulated to dismissing Mundie and Plaintiff's CFRA claims. Accordingly, only Plaintiff's five FEHA claims [*2]  and wrongful termination claim against Universal remain.
Presently before the Court is Universal's Motion for Summary Judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Universal's Motion.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise indicated:
On May 15, 2018, Plaintiff signed a contract to begin working with Universal as a delivery driver. (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 1, ECF No. 33-1). The contract stated that Plaintiff and Universal were not in an employer-employee relationship and required Plaintiff to provide his own truck for assignments. (Id. ¶ 2). In addition, Universal could terminate Plaintiff's contract if he failed to comply with Universal's policies and procedures. (Defs' Response to Additional Undisputed Facts ¶ 4, ECF No. 35-1). Under the contract, Plaintiff would be paid on a per job basis, and his compensation was non-negotiable. (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶¶ 9, 23).
On November 23,2018, Plaintiff suffered a head injury when he fell off the chassis of his truck during an assignment. (Id ¶ 28). Plaintiff contacted Viki Salvatore, who worked at Universal, to explain [*3]  what happened. (Id. ¶ 30). Plaintiff initially told Vicki that he did not believe the injury was serious, so he continued with his deliveries. (Id ¶ 30).
About a week later, Plaintiff began to experience headaches and blurry vision. (Pl's Dep. Tr. 136:21-137:8, ECF No. 31-9). He told Viki that he wanted to see his doctor in California. (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 34). Although Viki continued to give him deliveries throughout Texas, Georgia, and Atlanta, she promised to eventually route him back to California. (See Pl's Dep. Tr. at 141:19-25). During this time, Plaintiff also explained to his fleet manager, Kyle Turri, that he needed to see a doctor and wanted to return to California. (Id. at 138:17-25). However, he did not tell Viki or Kyle that he could no longer drive. (Id. at 163:23-25).
After about three weeks, Plaintiff arrived in California and underwent surgery to remove a subdural hematoma or "brain bleed." (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 37). Following his surgery, the Department of Transportation ("DOT") prohibited him from driving for six months. (Id. ¶ 39). Plaintiff also admitted that he could barely move after his surgery. (Pl's Dep. [*4]  Tr. 121:9-10).
On January 8,2019, Plaintiff's wife submitted an "Injury/Illness" Report to Universal. (Id. ¶ 40). The report stated: Plaintiff needed at least 29 days off, he had an upcoming doctor's appointment, and he would provide Universal with future updates. (Taurell Mack Decl. ¶ 10, ECF No. 33-8). Plaintiff also sent Universal a "Work Status Report" from his medical provider which stated that Plaintiff could not work from "12/16/2018 to 1/29/2019." (ECF No. 33-9).
Three days later, Universal's Operations Manager, Christopher Lawrence, fired Plaintiff. (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 45). Plaintiff was sent a Notice of Cancellation, which stated the reasons as: "1) diver is unavailable; 2) driver hasn't ran in a while and is building up deductions; and 3) driver will also be off work until medical qualified again." (Id. ¶ 46). Lawrence states that Plaintiff would have been rehired after he was medically cleared. (Lawrence Decl. ¶ 6, ECF No. 313). Plaintiff does not believe this to be true since Kyle had told him that he was no longer working for the company and nothing in the Notice of Cancellation indicated that Universal would rehire him. (Pl's Dep. Tr. at 175:10-25). [*5]  Because he believed he had been fired, Plaintiff never updated Universal when he could work again, (Id. at 172:2-7), and instead sought a job elsewhere, (Id. at 119:19-120:5).

III. JUDICIAL STANDARD
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), a court may grant summary judgment only where "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Facts are "material" only if dispute about them may affect the outcome of the case under applicable substantive law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmovant. Id.
To prevail on a summary judgment motion, the movant must show that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to matters on which it has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Such a showing "must establish beyond controversy every essential element" of the movant's claim or affirmative defense. S. Cal. Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). On issues where the moving party does not have the burden of proof at trial, the moving party is required only to show that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325.
To defeat a summary judgment motion, the non-moving [*6]  party may not merely rely on its pleadings or on conclusory statements. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Nor may the non-moving party merely attack or discredit the moving party's evidence. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., 701 F.2d 95, 97 (9th Cir. 1983). Rather, the non-moving party must affirmatively present specific evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Whether Plaintiff Was an Employee or an Independent Contractor
FEHA's antidiscrimination provisions protect employees, not independent contractors. Terry v. Register Tapes Unlimited, Inc., No. 2:16-CV-00806 WBS AC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36680, 2020 WL 1031288 (citing S. G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Dep't of Indus. Relations, 48 Cal. 3d 341, 359, 256 Cal. Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399 (1989)). So, Universal first argues that Plaintiff is not an employee. Both parties agree that the Court should use the "control" test set out in Borello to determine Plaintiff's employment status.
Under Borello, "[t]he principal test of an employment relationship is whether the person to whom service is rendered has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired." 48 Cal. 3d at 350. Courts may also consider secondary factors such as:
(a) whether the one performing services is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (b) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in the locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the principal [*7]  or by a specialist without supervision; (c) the skill required in the particular occupation; (d) whether the principal or the worker supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work for the person doing the work; (e) the length of time for which the services are to be performed; (f) the method of payment, whether by the time or by the job; (g) whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the principal; and (h) whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of employer-employee.
Narayan v. EGL, Inc. 616 F.3d 895, 900 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Borello, 48 Cal. 3d at 351). Other possible factors to consider are:
(1) the alleged employee's opportunity for profit or loss depending on his managerial skill; (2) the alleged employee's investment in equipment or materials required for his task, or his employment of helpers; (3) whether the service rendered requires a special skill; (4) the degree of permanence of the working relationship; and (5) whether the service rendered is an integral part of the alleged employer's business.
Narayan, 616 F.3d at 900-01. "[T]he individual factors cannot be applied mechanically as separate tests; they are intertwined and their weight depends on particular combinations." Id.
"[I]f reasonable people could differ on [*8]  whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor based on the evidence in the case, the question is not for a court to decide; it must go to the jury." Cotter v. Lift, Inc., 60 F. Supp. 3d 1067, 1076-77 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (citing Angelotti v. Walt Disney Co., 192 Cal. App. 4th 1394,1404, 121 Cal. Rptr. 3d 863 (2011)). But an employer-employee relationship "can be decided by the court as a matter of law if the evidence supports only one reasonable conclusion." Angelotti, 192 Cal. App. 4th at 1404 (citing Borello, 48 Cal. 3d at 349).
Universal argues that the evidence conclusively establishes that Plaintiff was an independent contractor because it did not exert control over Plaintiff. First, Plaintiff provided his own truck for deliveries. (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 4). Second, Universal did not require Plaintiff to work a set schedule. (Pl's Dep. Tr. at 93:5-14). Third, Plaintiff could choose which routes to take when making deliveries. (Id. at 90:16-23). And once Universal had assigned a delivery, Plaintiff could decide when to take breaks. (Id. at 91:8-19). Universal also did not provide Plaintiff with any training or require Plaintiff to wear a uniform. (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 19). Finally, Plaintiff could decline deliveries that Universal assigned him. (Pl's Dep. Tr. at 88:13-14).
Plaintiff, however, contends that the evidence points in [*9]  the other direction—that he was an employee. For example, Plaintiff maintains that drivers could not really decline work because doing so would result in them receiving fewer assignments in the future. (Id. at 88:1-12). Further, Universal provided Plaintiff with equipment to complete his job including the 53' trailer for deliveries, permits, licenses, company logos, and license plates. (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 31). Plaintiff also had to submit accident reports to the company and had to cooperate in any litigation as a result of the accident. (Defs' Response to Additional Undisputed Facts ¶ 12). Finally, Universal's HR policies and procedures applied to both delivery drivers and people it listed as employees. (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 30).
The secondary factors support both Universal and Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was paid per job, not time, (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 23); he did not receive performance reviews, (Id. ¶ 22); the contract was mutually terminable by both parties, (Pl's Dep. Tr. at 60:5-12); Plaintiff filed his taxes using 1099 forms, (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 10); and [*10]  the parties' contract explicitly labeled Plaintiff as an independent contractor, (Id. ¶ 2), all indicate that Plaintiff was an independent contractor. But other factors suggest that Plaintiff was an employee: Plaintiff's job driving—did not require specialized skills, his truck was integral to Universal's overall business, his payment was non-negotiable, (Defs' Response to Additional Undisputed Facts ¶ 6), and their contract relationship was for two years, (Id. ¶ 33), as opposed to a short-term deal.
Based on the evidence, the Court finds that reasonable people could conclude that Plaintiff was either an independent contractor or an employee. Thus, the question of Plaintiff's employment status is reserved for the jury.
Because Plaintiff may be able to prove he was an employee, Universal must refute the other elements of Plaintiff's claims to prevail on summary judgment.

B. Claim 1: Disability Discrimination
Assuming Plaintiff is an employee, California has adopted a three-stage burden shifting test for discrimination claims. Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). First, a plaintiff must present a prima facie case of discrimination. Holtzclaw v. Certainteed Corp., 795 F. Supp. 2d 996, 1010 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (citing Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994)). Then, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a non-discriminatory reason [*11]  for its employment decision. Id. Finally, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer's reasons were pretextual. Id. To prevail on summary judgment, an employer must show that the plaintiff either failed to establish one of the prima facie elements or that there was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory purpose for terminating the plaintiff's employment. See Dep't of Fair Employment and Housing v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Avila v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1247, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008)).
A prima facie case of disability discrimination requires the employee to show that he or she "1) suffered from a disability, 2) was otherwise qualified to do his or her job, and 3) was subjected to adverse employment action because of the disability." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 378, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015). Universal argues that Plaintiff was not "qualified" under FEHA.
A person is "qualified" if they can perform the essential functions of his or her job, with or without reasonable accommodation. Id. An employer may discharge the employee if the employee cannot perform the essential functions of the job even with reasonable accommodations. Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940. Universal argues that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of his job because the DOT had barred him from driving for at least six months after his surgery. Also, Plaintiff admitted that he "couldn't [*12]  work because [he] couldn't walk. [He] couldn't move." (Pl's Dep. Tr. 121:9-10). According to Universal, because Plaintiff could not walk, let alone drive, Universal was entitled to release him from his contract.
However, an individual is "qualified" if he or she can do the job "with or without reasonable accommodation." Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 378. A "finite leave [of absence] can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA, provided it is likely at the end of the leave, the employee would be able to perform his or her duties." Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). Thus, Universal must show that there were no genuine issues of material fact about Plaintiff's ability to continue driving even with some accommodation—in this case, a leave of absence.
Universal has failed to satisfy this burden. Universal's own Vice President of Labor Relations acknowledged that the company recognizes leaves of absences as an accommodation. (Glackin Dep. Tr. 68:20-25, ECF No. 33-5). It also undisputed that Plaintiff started driving again a few weeks after his six-month suspension ended. (See Pl's Dep. Tr. 119:14-120:2). Universal offers no evidence to rebut this fact. Thus, Plaintiff could have performed the essential functions of his job after a six-month leave, satisfying [*13]  his prima facie claim. While a six-month leave of absence may be unreasonable, the reasonableness of an accommodation is ultimately a question for the trier of fact. Salgado v. Iqvia, Inc., 459 F. Supp. 3d 1318, 1330 (S.D. Cal. 2020) (citing Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 228 n.11). Universal has therefore failed to disprove the prima facie elements of Plaintiff's FEHA claim.
The burden now shifts to Universal to articulate non-discriminatory explanations for terminating Plaintiff. Universal does not assert that it fired Plaintiff due to performance or disciplinary concerns. (Defs' Response to Additional Undisputed Facts ¶ 10). Instead, the three given reasons were: "1) driver is unavailable; 2) driver hasn't ran in a while and is building up deductions; and 3) driver will also be off work until medical qualified again." (Pl's Response to Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 46). Essentially, Plaintiff was fired because he was unavailable to drive. But Plaintiff's unavailability is inherently intertwined with his disability—he was only unavailable because he had been injured. This would be akin to firing a pregnant woman for being "unavailable" because she needed maternity leave. Thus, Universal's reasons seem to be tacit admissions that Plaintiffs termination was due to his disability. As Universal [*14]  has not offered a non-discriminatory reason for cancelling Plaintiff's contract, it is not entitled to summary judgment on the disability discrimination claim.

C. Claim 2: Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Next, the Court tams towards Plaintiff's second cause of action: failure to engage in the interactive process. Under FEHA, "[i]t is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer . . . to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . with a known physical or mental disability." Dep't of Fair Employment and Housing v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 742-43 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n) (alterations in original)). "[T]he interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identify[ing] an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 742-43 (quoting Nadaf—Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 985, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008)).
Here, Universal contends that this claim fails because Plaintiff was not a qualified individual with disability, and the interactive process was never triggered. As the Court has already addressed the first argument, it [*15]  turns to the second.
"Typically, an applicant or employee triggers the employer's obligation to participate in the interactive process by requesting an accommodation." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 63 n.22, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006) (citing Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(n)). Universal argues that Plaintiff never requested an accommodation. The Court disagrees.
Although Plaintiff admits that he never overtly requested an accommodation, (Pl's Dep. Tr. 177:17-19), the Injury Report sent to Universal on January 8 indicated that Plaintiff would need at least 29 days off. This statement could be construed as a request for leave of absence.
Plaintiff's appeals to be given deliveries towards California could also be requests for accommodation. An accommodation is a modification of the work environment that would enable the employee to perform the essential functions of their job. See Nadaf—Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 975, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). Universal argues that there is "no authority . . . that request to see a doctor in a particular place (California) or at a particular time (faster) constitutes a reasonable accommodation." (Reply at 4, ECF No. 35). But routing Plaintiff towards California would have modified his job, and still allowed him to continue performing the job's essential duties. Thus, giving Plaintiff deliveries towards California [*16]  could be viewed as accommodations.
Plaintiff has therefore raised triable issues of fact as to whether he requested accommodations, which would have jumpstarted Universal's obligations to engage in the interactive process. Accordingly, the Court denies Universal's Motion for Summary Judgment as it pertains Plaintiff's second claim.

D. Claim 3: Failure to Accommodate
The Court now addresses Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim. The elements of this claim are: "(1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position; and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiffs disability." Salgado, 459 F. Supp. at 1327 (citing Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal.-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1010, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009)).
Universal contends that it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff is not a qualified individual with a disability, and he never requested a reasonable accommodation. The Court has already declined to grant summary judgment based on both arguments. The Court therefore denies Universal's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate.

E. Claim 4: FEHA Retaliation
Next comes Plaintiff's retaliation claim under FEHA. A plaintiff must initially show that: 1) he engaged [*17]  in protected activity; 2) the employer subjected him or her to an adverse employment action; and 3) there was a causal link between the two. Nadaf—Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 990. Once that prima facie case has been made, the burden shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. If the employer does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove intentional retaliation. Id.
Universal argues that Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case for retaliation because he was not engaged in a protected activity. And, even if Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing, Plaintiff has not presented evidence of retaliatory intent. The Court addresses each argument in turn.
A protected activity "takes the form of opposing any practices forbidden by FEHA or participating in any proceeding conducted by the DFEH ["Department of Fair Employment and Housing"] or the Fair Employment Housing Council (FEHC)." Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 380. A "protected activity does not include a mere request for reasonable accommodation" because "exercising one's rights under FEHA to request reasonable accommodation or engage in the interactive process does not demonstrate some [*18]  degree of opposition to or protest of unlawful conduct by the employer." Id. at 382.
Here, Plaintiff argues that he engaged in a protected activity by requesting an accommodation. (Opp'n at 16, ECF No. 33). But without more, requesting a reasonable accommodation is not a protected activity. See Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 382. Plaintiff has not identified any other protected activities that he participated in and has therefore failed to establish the prima facie elements of retaliation. Accordingly, the Court grants Universal's Motion for Summary Judgment as it pertains to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

F. Claim 5: Failure to Prevent of Discrimination and/or Retaliation
Under FEHA, it is unlawful "for an employer . . . to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring" in the workplace. Lelaind v. City and Ciy. of San Francisco, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1103 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (citing Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(k)). Plaintiff and Universal concede that this claim is entirely derivative of Plaintiff's other claims. (See Mot. Summ J. at 18; Opp'n at 19).
Because the Court denied summary judgment with respect to the disability discrimination claim, the Court also denies summary judgment as to this claim. See Lelaind, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 1103 (deciding that a failure to prevent retaliation claim survives summary judgment when the [*19]  underlying retaliation claim makes it past summary judgment).

G. Claim 8: Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
The Court now arrives at Plaintiff's last claim: wrongful termination in violation of public policy. An employee must identify the specific statutes or constitutional provisions that gives rise to a violation of public policy. Day v. Sears Holdings Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d at 1146, 1189 (C.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Green v. Rake Eng'g Co., 19 Cal. 4th 66, 78, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (1998)). Here, Plaintiff submits that his firing violated public policy under FEHA and Article 1, Section 8 of the California Constitution.
The Court has already denied Universal's Motion pursuant to Plaintiffs disability discrimination claim under FEHA; thus, it is appropriate to deny summary judgment for Plaintiffs claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy of FEHA. See Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, 658 F .3d 1108, 1118 (9th Cir. 2011) (denying summary judgment for a wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim based on the underlying FEHA discrimination claim's survival of summary judgment).
Neither party addresses whether a plaintiff may maintain a wrongful termination claim based on Article 1, Section 8 of the California Constitution in their briefing. And as the Court has already denied summary judgment based on FEHA, it does not consider the applicability of the California Constitution to this claim at this time.

H. Punitive Damages
Finally, [*20]  Universal argues that any claim for punitive damages against Universal must be dismissed. The Court disagrees.
Under California law, to prevail on a punitive damages claim, a plaintiff must establish malice, oppression, or fraud by clear and convincing evidence. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294. A violation of FEHA allows a plaintiff to recover punitive damages. McInteer v. Ashley Distrib. Set v., Ltd., 40 F. Supp. 3d 1269, 1295 (C.D. Cal. 2014). As the Court denied summary judgment on Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim, it would be premature to dismiss the request for punitive damages at this stage.
Nevertheless, Universal argues that Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages fails as a matter of law because, when a corporation is liable, an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation must authorize or ratify the act of oppression, fraud, or malice. Yeager v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 944 F. Supp. 2d 913, 931 (E.D. Cal. 2013). And here, Universal contends that the person who made the decision to terminate Plaintiff, Christopher Lawrence, was not an officer, director, or managing agent.
Plaintiff counters that Lawrence—Universal's Operations Manager at the time—may qualify as a managing agent. (See Opp'n at 1920). Managing agents are employees who "exercise substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate [*21]  policy." White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 563, 573, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944, (1999). Whether an individual is a managing agent is generally a question of fact. Id. at 567. Mere authority to fire an employee does not, without more, designate that an individual as a managing agent. Id. at 574. Thus, to survive summary judgment, Plaintiff must present triable issues of fact that Lawrence "exercised substantial discretionary authority" that led to corporate policy decisions. See Davis v. Kiewit Pac. Co., 220 Cal. App. 4th 358, 366, 162 Cal. Rptr. 3d 805 (2013).
Lawrence testified in his deposition that he was involved in discussions around changes in "policy or procedure for the operations department . . . ." (Lawrence Dep. Tr. at 145:21-146:12). In addition, Lawrence admitted to participating in monthly high-level meetings with other executives. (Id. at 143:24-144:19). Although Lawrence declared that he has never "been authorized to make changes to any existing Universal policies or procedures," (Lawrence Decl. ¶ 9), Plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact of Lawrence's possible status as a managing agent. Thus, a jury, not the Court, must decide whether Lawrence ultimately qualifies as a managing agent.
Accordingly, the Court denies Universal's Motion for Summary Judgment as it pertains to Plaintiff's prayer [*22]  of punitive damages.

V. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
In moving for, or opposing, a summary judgment motion, "[a] party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Both parties have filed objections to the other party's evidence, primarily based on hearsay, lack of foundation, relevance, and improper speculation. While these objections may be cognizable at trial, on a motion for summary judgment, the Court is concerned only with the admissibility of the relevant facts at trial, and not the form of these facts as presented in the Motions. See O'Banion v. Select Portfolio Servs., Inc., No. CV 1:09-00249-EJL-CWD, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135813, 2012 WL 4793442, at *5 (D. Idaho Aug. 22, 2012) ("If the contents of the evidence could be presented in an admissible form at trial, those contents may be considered on summary judgment even if the evidence itself is hearsay."); Burch v. Regents of Univ. of 433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1119-20 (E.D. Cal. 2006) (making the distinction between facts and evidence, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e), and overruling objections that evidence was irrelevant, speculative and/or argumentative).
To the extent the Court has relied on any other evidence to which the parties have objected, the objections are OVERRULED. To the extent the Court does not, [*23]  the objections are DENIED as moot.

VI. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Universal's Motion for Summary Judgment.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
