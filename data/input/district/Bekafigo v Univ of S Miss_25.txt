I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Marija Bekafigo ("Plaintiff") filed this action in the Circuit Court of Forrest County, Mississippi, on December 12, 2016, against Defendants University of Southern Miss ("USM") and Board of Trustees of the State Institutions of Higher Learning (the "Board") (collectively "Defendants") and brings allegations of sex discrimination under Title VII, failure to accommodate under the Rehabilitation Act and/or the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"),1 and wage discrimination under both Title VII and the Equal Pay Act ("EPA").
Plaintiff was been employed as an Assistant Professor of Political Science by USM from 2008 until 2015. In October 2010, she was diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder ("ADHD"). (See Plaintiff Depo. [35-3] at 80:11-15.) Though Plaintiff had informal conversations about her ADHD with Dr. Mark Wrighton, the associate dean of the College of Arts and Letters, she did not contact Human Resources to discuss possible accommodations until March 2012. (See id. 84:20-86:20.) In March 2012, she met with Linda Rasmussen ("Rasmussen"), and they discussed various accommodations for her ADHD, including extra time on [*3]  her tenure track, scheduling her classes in a helpful way, working on her research from home, closing the door to her office, and having an ADHD coach. (See id. at 90:17-91:17.) The meeting concluded with Rasmussen disagreeing with Plaintiff over whether she needed extra time to make tenure and stating that she was going to talk to the then chair of the Political Science Department, Dr. Allen McBride. (See id. at 91:23 94:12.) Plaintiff also spoke with Dr. McBride, who was amenable to all the suggested accommodations, including the extra time to make tenure. (See id. at 95:4-96:22.)
Plaintiff met with Rasmussen again in September 2012 to discuss her accommodations. (See id. at 98:19-22.) In November 2012, Plaintiff met with Dr. McBride again, who advised her that she was on track for tenure. (See id. at 102:5-23.) Plaintiff met with Rasmussen in December 2012 and relayed Dr. McBride's assertion regarding her tenure track. (See id. at 104:18-105:19.) Since that meeting, Plaintiff never made a written request for extra time to make tenure, but communicated her dismay about not getting extra time to Dr. McBride, who assured her that it was not needed because she was on track for tenure [*4]  but that they would address it if the need arose. (See id. at 107:10-25.) Plaintiff also stated that this was confirmed by Dr. David Butler, Dr. McBride's successor as chair. (See id.)
On January 28, 2013, Plaintiff sent a letter to Dr. McBride complaining about wage disparities in the department and requesting an increase in her salary. (See id. at 48:3-12; see also Letter [35-4].) This is the only complaint about wage disparities Plaintiff ever made prior to May 20, 2015.2 (See Plaintiff Depo. [35-3] at 49:18-50:3.) In her letter, Plaintiff complains about being paid less than two newly hired faculty members in the department, Dr. Joe Weinberg, a male, and Dr. Ngoc Phan, a female. (See Plaintiff Depo. [35-3] at 48:8-25; Letter [35-4].)
Dr. McBride forwarded Plaintiff's request to Dr. Steven Moser, the then Dean of the College of Arts and Letters, who sent her an e-mail in response. (See Plaintiff Depo. [35-3] at 51:22-52:4.) Dr. Moser explained to Plaintiff that, due to budgetary issues, a salary increase could not be considered, and that the strategy for hiring new faculty was to hire them at salaries at or near the regional averages, which were higher than the average salaries [*5]  of the current USM faculty. (See id. at 52:9-53:11; see also Moser Affidavit, E-mail Exhibit [35-5] at p. 4.)
Plaintiff also stated in her deposition that Michael Lavender received a higher salary than she did. Lavender is an attorney serving as an associate professor in the Political Science Department and the director of paralegal studies. (See Plaintiff Depo [35-3] at 69:3-70:19.)
Plaintiff became eligible for tenure and promotion in fall of 2014. Tenure is reviewed on multiple levels, and recommendations were given from each one.
On October 13, 2014, the Department of Political Science, by a vote of 7-3-1 of the tenured faculty, recommended that Plaintiff be granted tenure and promotion to Associate Professor. (See Department Memo [35-6].) The faculty cited Plaintiff's service to the department, her publications, and her strong teaching record. (See id.) They further noted that she had "minimally met [their] expectations for research." (Id.)
On October 22, 2014, Dr. Butler, the chair of the Political Science Department, submitted his recommendation that Plaintiff not be granted tenure and promotion, citing her poor teaching record, lack of a "robust research agenda," and her failure [*6]  to take a more active role of leadership in the university community. (See Butler Memo [35-9].)
On November 21, 2014, the College Advisory Committee ("CAC") voted 6-4-1-13 in favor of recommending that Plaintiff be granted tenure and promotion. (See CAC Memo [35-7].) In a "tight mixed voted," the CAC found that she met the five peer-reviewed publications requirement of the department,4 had a satisfactory evaluation record, and had supervised internships and thesis projects. (Id.)
On January 7, 2015, Dr. Moser sent a memo to Dr. Denis Wiesenburg, the then Provost, summarizing the positions that the department faculty, Dr. Butler, and the CAC took on Plaintiff's tenure and promotion. (See Moser Memo [35-10].) In offering his own recommendation, Dr. Moser stated that he saw "no evidence in the dossier of the sustained pattern of excellence in teaching, research, and service as per the expectation for tenure stated in the departmental document" and that her work met only "the minimal standards of the departmental guidelines." (Id.) He was also troubled that neither the department nor the CAC addressed the opinions of their members who voted against tenure and promotion. (See id.)
The University [*7]  Advisory Committee ("UAC") weighed in on Plaintiff's application for tenure and promotion on February 20, 2015. (See UAC Memo [35-8].) In a 9-1-0-2 vote, the UAC recommended tenure and promotion, mentioning her "wide variety of courses," her "good" teaching evaluations, and her "good" or "excellent" service evaluations over the years. (Id.)
On March 8, 2015, after considering the recommendations of the department faculty, Dr. Butler, the CAC, Dr. Moser, and the UAC, Dr. Wiesenburg, recommended that Plaintiff not be given tenure or a promotion and remanded the matter back for a de novo review. (See Wiesenburg Memo [35-11].) Dr. Wiesenburg determined that the high number of negative votes in the department and the CAC merited this review. (See id.) He was also concerned about misrepresentations by Plaintiff regarding the role of Dr. Butler in the tenure process, "the presumably lax standards of the department in consideration of candidates for promotion and tenure," and lack of clarity in the CAC's explanation of their decision. (Id.)
On March 23, 2015, after the remand, the CAC issued a memo changing its recommendation and advising that Plaintiff not be granted tenure or promotion. ( [*8] See Second CAC Memo [35-12].) In their new decision, the CAC admitted that their previous recommendation was based on the "ambiguous and minimal" guidelines from the department and focused on quantity of work rather than quality. (Id.) In its de novo review focusing on quality, the CAC found in a mixed vote5 that Plaintiff's scholarly work did not "suggest . . . that [Plaintiff] is poised to achieve 'professional excellence . . . that . . . will contribute substantially over a considerable period of time to the mission and anticipated needs of the University.'" (Id.) They also found her to be a "minimally effective teacher" and that there was "alarmingly little consistency between the annual [evaluation] scores and pre-tenure, promotion, and tenure evaluations" leading them to believe that these documents could not be trusted. (Id.)
On March 26, 2015, Dr. Moser responded to the remand and stated that, drawing from both the original dossier submitted by Plaintiff and the rebuttal materials, his opinion that she not be granted tenure or promotion remained the same. (See Second Moser Memo [35-13].) Though admitting that the evidence suggested her performance was "satisfactory" and that she [*9]  met the "minimal" expectations for tenure and promotion, he did not find that she met the standard of "professional excellence" required by departmental guidelines. (Id.)
On April 7, 2015, the UAC, in its de novo review, unanimously6 supported tenure and promotion for Plaintiff, finding that she had "met the departmental standards in research, teaching, and service." (Second UAC Memo [35-14].)
On April 15, 2015, Dr. Wiesenburg relayed the recommendations of the department, Dr. Butler, Dr. Moser, the CAC, and the UAC to Dr. Rodney Bennett, the President of USM, and offered his own recommendation that Plaintiff not be granted tenure or promotion. (See Wiesenburg Letter [35-15].)
On April 21, 2015, Dr. Bennett sent Plaintiff a letter informing her that he agreed with Dr. Wiesenburg's recommendation and denying her tenure and promotion. (See Bennett Letter [35-16].)
On May 12, 2015,7 Plaintiff was terminated from her employment at USM. (See EEOC Charge [35-17].) She filed her EEOC Charge [35-17] on May 20, 2015.

II. MOTIONS TO STRIKE [48][51]
Plaintiff's Motion to Strike [48] asks the Court to strike USM's Rebuttal in Support [46], arguing that USM's arguments have no merit and should not be considered. [*10]  In substance, this motion is nothing more than an improper sur-response, which the Court will not consider. The Motion to Strike [48] will be denied.
Because this motion is denied, Defendant's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Motion to Strike [51] will be denied as moot.

III. USM'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [35]

A. Standard of Review
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides that "[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "Where the burden of production at trial ultimately rests on the nonmovant, the movant must merely demonstrate an absence of evidentiary support in the record for the nonmovant's case." Cuadra v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 626 F.3d 808, 812 (5th Cir. 2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The nonmovant must then "come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Id. "An issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action." Sierra Club, Inc. v. Sandy Creek Energy Assocs., L.P., 627 F.3d 134, 138 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting Daniels v. City of Arlington, Tex., 246 F.3d 500, 502 (5th Cir. 2001)). "An issue is 'genuine' if the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable [fact-finder] to return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Cuadra, 626 F.3d at 812 (citation omitted).
The Court is not permitted to make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence. [*11]  Deville v. Marcantel, 567 F.3d 156, 164 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., 476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir. 2007)). When deciding whether a genuine fact issue exists, "the court must view the facts and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Sierra Club, 627 F.3d at 138. However, "[c]onclusional allegations and denials, speculation, improbable inferences, unsubstantiated assertions, and legalistic argumentation do not adequately substitute for specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial." Oliver v. Scott, 276 F.3d 736, 744 (5th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). Summary judgment is mandatory "against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Brown v. Offshore Specialty Fabricators, Inc., 663 F.3d 759, 766 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)).

B. Sex Discrimination
Plaintiff brings her sex discrimination claim under Title VII and alleges that she was denied tenure and promotion because she is a woman. Because there is no direct evidence of sex discrimination in this case, the Court applies the burden-shifting framework articulated by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).8
Under that framework, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. If the plaintiff succeeds in showing a prima facie case, the defendant must then provide some legitimate, non-discriminatory [*12]  reason for the employee's rejection. Lastly, if the employer gives a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment action, the plaintiff must then prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the proffered reason was mere pretext for discrimination.
Byers v. Dallas Morning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419, 425 (5th Cir. 2000) (internal citations omitted).
In order to establish a prima facie case for discrimination, Plaintiff must show "that she: (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was qualified for her position; (3) was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) was replaced by someone outside the protected class, or, in the case of disparate treatment, shows that others similarly situated were treated more favorably." Okoye v. Univ. of Tex. Hous. Health Sci. Ctr., 245 F.3d 507, 512-13 (5th Cir. 2001) (quoting Shackelford v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, 190 F.3d 398, 404 (5th Cir. 1999)) (internal quotations omitted). Once Plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to establish her prima facie case, the burden then shifts to USM to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision. Byers, 209 F.3d at 425. This burden "is one of production, not persuasion" and involves "no credibility assessment." Alvarado v. Tex. Rangers, 492 F.3d 605, 611 (5th 2007). Once USM has met this requirement, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff, who must show that the given reasons are pretextual by offering
sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact either [*13]  (1) that the defendant's reason is not true, but is instead a pretext for discrimination . . . ; or (2) that the defendant's reason, while true, is only one of the reasons for its conduct, and another motivating factor is the plaintiff's protected characteristic.
Keelan v. Majesco Software, Inc., 407 F.3d 332, 341 (5th Cir. 2005) (quoting Rachid v. Jack In The Box, Inc., 376 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir. 2004)).
In its motion, USM makes no argument that Plaintiff has not adduced evidence to establish her prima facie case, but points to the various negative recommendations from Dr. Butler, Dr. Moser, the CAC, and Dr. Wiesenburg as its legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its decision. Though many reasons were given in these recommendations,9 the main issue seems to have been that, though Plaintiff met the minimal quantity requirement for her work, the quality of her work was less than the "excellence" standard required by the department. As this evidence is enough to satisfy USM's burden of production, the burden now shifts to Plaintiff to show that these reasons are pretextual.
Plaintiff offers no evidence to discredit the reasons offered by USM. Instead, she contends that she was as qualified or more qualified for tenure and promotion than her male counterparts, who did receive tenure and [*14]  promotion. Plaintiff, however, has given no evidence demonstrating how her qualifications compared to her male colleagues who received tenure and promotion, other than her own subjective beliefs. More than subjective belief, however, is required to support a claim of sex discrimination. See, e.g., Roberson v. Alltell Information Servs., 373 F.3d 647, 654 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Lawrence v. Univ. of Tex. Med. Branch at Galveston, 163 F.3d 309, 313 (5th Cir. 1999)) (stating that subjective belief of discrimination was not enough to create inference of a discriminatory intent). Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to show that the reasons offered by USM are pretextual, and the Motion for Summary Judgment [35] must be granted as to this claim. Plaintiff's sex discrimination claim under Title VII for failure to promote will be dismissed with prejudice.

C. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff brings her failure to accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act.10 For Plaintiff to survive summary judgment on this claim, she must adduce evidence that (1) she is "a qualified individual with a disability;" (2) "the disability and its consequential limitations were known" by USM; and (3) USM "failed to make reasonable accommodations for the known limitations." Feist v. La, Dep't of Justice, Office of the Attorney Gen., 730 F.3d 450, 452 (5th Cir. 2013).11 Plaintiff argues that USM failed to accommodate her by giving her additional time to make tenure and [*15]  failed to engage in the required interactive process to determine the best means to accommodate her.
First, though Plaintiff is correct that USM was required by law to engage in an "interactive process," the evidence shows no dispute as to the fact that USM did engage in this process. See Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., LP, 570 F.3d 606, 621 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 433 F.3d 100, 108 (1st Cir. 2005)). USM was required to have "a meaningful dialogue with the employee to find the best means of accommodating [her] disability." Id. Plaintiff testified that Human Resources and her chair, Dr. McBride, both discussed accommodations with her on a continuing basis and that the only accommodation she was not given was extra time to make tenure. (See Plaintiff Depo. [35-3] at 84:20-107:25.)12 By Plaintiff's own admission, then, USM engaged in an interactive process to determine accommodations that could be made for her.
Plaintiff also argues that USM should have given her additional time to make tenure. However, Plaintiff's own testimony states that this additional time was never definitely foreclosed to her. (See Plaintiff Depo. [35-5] at 107:15-25.) Both Dr. McBride and Dr. Butler, who replaced Dr. McBride as chair of the department, assured Plaintiff that if extra time to [*16]  make tenure was needed, then it was something that they could "deal with" when the time came. (See id.) When the time came to submit her dossier for tenure and promotion consideration, Plaintiff testified that she "[a]bsolutely" felt that she had met the criteria and, in fact, "felt like [she] had exceeded them." (See id. at 7:14-18; 8:18-25.) Plaintiff's ADHD, then, did not put a "known limitation[]" on her ability to make tenure in the prescribed time as even Plaintiff did not believe that she had inadequate time to meet the requirements for tenure and promotion. See Feist, 730 F.3d at 452.
Plaintiff therefore has not adduced enough evidence as to her failure-to-accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act. The Motion for Summary Judgment [35] will be granted as to this claim, and it will be dismissed with prejudice.

D. Wage Discrimination
Plaintiff brings allegations of wage discrimination under both the EPA and Title VII. She claims that her similarly situated male colleagues were paid more than she was.

1. Title VII13
A wage discrimination claim under Title VII, where there is no direct evidence of discrimination, is subject to the same burden-shifting framework as Plaintiff's sex discrimination claim. [*17]  See Taylor v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 554 F.3d 510, 522 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing Ross v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio, 139 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir. 1998)). Therefore, Plaintiff must first show that she can establish a prima facie case. Id. The burden then shifts to USM to provide a non-discriminatory reason for any pay disparities before shifting back to Plaintiff to show pretext. Id.
To establish a prima facie claim of wage discrimination, Plaintiff must show that "[s]he was a member of a protected class and that [s]he was paid less than a non-member for work requiring substantially the same responsibility." Id. (citing Uviedo v Steves Sash & Door Co., 738 F.2d 1425, 1431 (5th Cir. 1984)). Plaintiff must provide evidence that her "pay was lower than specific employees who are not members of the protected class" and that her "circumstances are 'nearly identical' to those of a better-paid employee." Id. at 523 (emphasis in original).
Plaintiff identifies three specific employees that she claims were paid more than she was. One is Dr. Ngoc Phan, a woman who is within Plaintiff's protected class and cannot be the basis for her claim. The other two, Dr. Joe Weinberg and Michael Lavender, are men, but Plaintiff has pointed to no evidence showing that her circumstances were "nearly identical" to either of them. See Taylor, 554 F.3d at 523. In fact, Plaintiff admitted in her deposition that Lavender served as the director of paralegal [*18]  studies as well as an associate professor and had responsibilities associated with that position that she did not have. (See Plaintiff Depo [35-3] at 69:3-70:19.)
Furthermore, even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of wage discrimination based on Dr. Weinberg, she has not proven that USM's given reasons are pretextual. USM argues that Dr. Weinberg was hired at a higher salary, along with Dr. Phan, in an effort to make the university more competitive in the region. (See Plaintiff Depo. [35-5] at 52:9-53:11; see also Moser Affidavit, E-mail Exhibit [35-5] at p. 4.) Plaintiff has provided no evidence that this reason is untrue or that gender was a motivating factor regardless of this reason.
Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to adduce enough evidence to survive summary judgment on her wage discrimination claim under Title VII. The Motion for Summary Judgment [35] will be granted as to this claim, and it will be dismissed with prejudice.

2. EPA
The EPA prohibits an employer from
paying wages to employees . . . at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex . . . for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and [*19]  responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex.
29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1). "In short, [the EPA] demands that equal wages reward equal work." Siler-Khodr v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr. San Antonio, 261 F.3d 542, 546 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing Corming Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 195, 94 S. Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974)).
Once a plaintiff has made her prima facie case by showing that an employer compensates employees differently for equal work, the burden shifts to the defendant to "prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the wage differential is justified under one of the four affirmative defenses set forth in the Equal Pay Act."
Id. (quoting Kovacevich v. Kent State Univ., 224 F.3d 806, 826 (6th Cir. 2000)).
The undisputed evidence shows that Plaintiff, who was serving as an assistant professor at the time, did not do work "equal" to Lavender, who she admits was an attorney serving as both associate professor in the Political Science Department and the director of paralegal studies. (See Plaintiff Depo [35-3] at 69:3-70:19.)
Furthermore, even if Plaintiff were able to adduce evidence that Dr. Weinberg's work for USM was "equal" to her own, a contention for which she has provided no [*20]  evidence, USM has presented undisputed evidence that the compensation of Dr. Weinberg was based on a factor other than sex, which is the fourth affirmative defense under the EPA. Dr. Weinberg, like Dr. Phan, was hired at a rate of compensation that was competitive with other universities in the region, which was admittedly higher than the average salary at USM, and the evidence shows that this was done in an effort to make USM more competitive with in the region. (See Plaintiff Depo. [35-5] at 52:9-53:11; see also Moser Affidavit, E-mail Exhibit [35-5] at p. 4.)
Because there is no genuine dispute of fact as to whether Lavender's work was "equal" to Plaintiff's or whether USM based Dr. Weinberg's compensation on a factor that was not sex, Plaintiff's claim under the EPA must fail. The Motion for Summary Judgment [35] will be granted as to this claim, and it will be dismissed with prejudice.

IV. THE BOARD'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [37]
Because the claims against the Board are based on the conduct of USM, which the Board allegedly "acceded to, ratified, and aggravated," and the claims against the it are identical to the claims against USM, there is no independent basis of liability [*21]  against the Board. (Amended Complaint [5] at ¶ 19.) Therefore, because the claims against USM fail, the claims against the Board must also fail, and its Motion for Summary Judgment [37] will be granted. The claims against the Board will be dismissed with prejudice.

V. CONCLUSION
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion for Summary Judgment [35] is granted. Plaintiff's claims against USM are dismissed with prejudice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion for Summary Judgment [37] is granted. Plaintiff's claims against the Board are dismissed with prejudice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion to Strike [48] is denied.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Motion to Strike [51] is denied as moot.
SO ORDERED AND ADJUDGED, on this, the 30th day of April, 2018.
