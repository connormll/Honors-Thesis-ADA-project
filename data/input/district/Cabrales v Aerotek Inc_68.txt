Before the Court is Defendant Aerotek, Inc.'s ("Defendant") motion for summary judgment. ("Motion," Dkt. No. 30-1.) The Court considers this matter appropriate for resolution without a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. On October 25, 2018, the Court vacated the October 29, 2018 hearing and took the matter under submission. (Dkt. No. 43.) After considering all papers submitted in support of, and in opposition to, the Motion, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.

I. BACKGROUND
On June 20, 2017, Plaintiff Myrna Gomez Cabrales ("Plaintiff") filed a complaint in the Superior Court of [*2]  the State of California, County of San Bernardino. ("Complaint," Dkt. No. 1-1.) Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: (1) disability discrimination; (2) failure to engage in the interactive process; (3) failure to accommodate a disability; (4) retaliation for exercising rights to take protected leave in violation of California Family Rights Act ("CFRA") and Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (5) retaliation under FEHA; (6) failure to prevent disability discrimination; and (7) wrongful termination in violation of public policy. (Id.) These causes of action arise out of Defendant's employment of Plaintiff and Defendant's alleged failure to engage in the interactive process, failure to accommodate Plaintiff's disability, failure to honor Plaintiff's request for FMLA/CFRA leave, and termination of Plaintiff's employment.

II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendant requests judicial notice of the following documents:
• Licensing Details for Artis Woodward, MD (Dkt. No. 30-8 at 3)5
○ Decision and Order in In the Matter of the Petition for Termination of Probation of Artis Woodward, MD (Dkt. No. 30-8 at 5)
○ Decision and Order in In the Matter of the Accusation Against Artis Woodward, MD (Dkt. No. 30-8 at 14);
○ Accusation in In the Matter of the Accusation Against Artis Woodward, MD (Dkt. No. 30-8 at 27);
• Licensing Details for Joseph Stadish (Dkt. No. 30-9 at 3);
(RJN.)
A court may take judicial notice of an adjudicative fact not subject to "reasonable dispute," either because it is "generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court," or it is capable of accurate and ready determination [*9]  by resort to sources whose "accuracy Page 6 of 32 CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL Initials of Deputy Clerk MG cannot reasonably be questioned." Fed. R. Evid. 201. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, "[a] court must take judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary information." Fed. R. Evid. 201(c)(2). Proceedings of other courts, including orders and filings, are also the proper subject of judicial notice when directly related to the case. See United States ex rel. Robinson Rancheria Citizens Council v. Borneo, Inc., 971 F.2d 244, 248 (9th Cir. 1992) (stating that courts "may take notice of proceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal judicial system, if those proceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue.") Judicial notice is also appropriate for "materials incorporated into the complaint or matters of public record." Coto Settlement v. Eisenberg, 593 F.3d 1031, 1038 (9th Cir. 2010). But disputed facts contained within a filing and the factual determinations by a judge in another case "ordinarily are not admissible for their truth in another case through judicial notice." Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, 1114 n.5 (9th Cir. 2003); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 690 (9th Cir. 2001).
Each document here is a matter of public record as records of the State of California. They are proper items for judicial notice. Thus, the Court GRANTS Defendant's request for judicial notice.

III. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
Defendant objects on evidentiary grounds to almost the entirety of Plaintiff's [*10]  Declaration. (Plaintiff Decl. Objection.) Defendant also objects to seven paragraphs of the Velarde Declaration. (Velarde Decl. Objection.)
Defendant objects to 76 of the 87 paragraphs in Plaintiff's Declaration. (See Plaintiff Decl. Objection.) Defendant objects to whole paragraphs in their entirety—even quite long ones—using a combination of the following objections: conclusory, hearsay, lacks foundation, and irrelevant. (Id.) Defendant provides no explanation or case citations for a single objection. (Id.) Defendant appears to be asking the Court to do Defendant's job, hoping that at least some objections will stick. This approach is consistent with Defendant's general approach to this Motion. The Court finds that many of these objections are frivolous. The following are a few examples:
• Plaintiff's Declaration ¶ 32: "Since then, I have intermittently taken the migraine medication Imitrex and seen medical providers for treatment."
Defendant objects on grounds that this statement is hearsay, conclusory, lacking foundation, and irrelevant. First, there is no potential of an out-of-court statement such that hearsay might possibly be an issue. Second, it is unclear how Plaintiff's attestation [*11]  that she has taken Imitrex and sought medical treatment is either conclusory or lacking foundation. Finally, this statement is relevant for Plaintiff to establish her alleged disabilities.
• Plaintiff's Declaration ¶ 33: "My migraine headache symptoms typically include pain in the lower right side and front of my head, nausea, dizziness, occasional blurred vision, and sensitivity to light and noise."
Defendant objects on grounds that this statement is hearsay, conclusory, and lacking foundation. Again, there is no potential of an out-of-court statement such that hearsay might be an issue. Plaintiff simply describes her own physical sensations. Second, the Court is perplexed as to how such a precise description of symptoms is conclusory. Finally, the Court is baffled as to how Plaintiff lacks foundation to describe her own physical sensations, something totally and uniquely within her own first-hand knowledge.
• Plaintiff's Declaration ¶ 41: "As a result of my back pain, I was unable to work and I had difficulty sitting, standing, and performing manual tasks, among other things, during the periods in which I sought my first FMLA/CFRA leave (August 15, 2016 to October 3, 2016) and my second [*12]  FMLA/CFRA leave (February 7, 2017 until my termination on April 8, 2017)."
Defendant objects on grounds that this statement is hearsay, conclusory, and lacking foundation. Again, there is no potential of an out-of-court statement such that hearsay might be an issue. Plaintiff simply describes her own physical limitations she attributes to her back pain. Second, the Court is perplexed as to how this description of Plaintiff's own physical limitations is conclusory. The connection between back pain and the inability is quite direct. Finally, the Court is confused at how Plaintiff lacks foundation to describe her own physical limitations resulting from her pain.
• Plaintiff's Declaration ¶ 65: "I discussed my lower back pain with supervisor Winkler approximately 3-4 times and Howdyshell approximately two times."
Defendant objects on grounds that this statement is hearsay, conclusory, lacking foundation, and irrelevant. Although Defendant at least identifies a paragraph for which there is an out-of-court statement, the purpose of such statements is not to prove the truth of Plaintiff's back pain, but to show Defendant had notice of this purported disability. This is a non-hearsay use and [*13]  perfectly admissible. Second, it is unclear how this statement is conclusory or lacking foundation. Plaintiff gives approximate numbers of discussions within her first-hand knowledge. Third, that Defendant knew of Plaintiff's disabilities is directly relevant as to whether or not Defendant discriminated against her because of them.
Because the Court finds too many of Defendant's objections are made in bad faith, it will not consider any of Defendant's objections to Plaintiff's Declaration. Accordingly, all objections to Plaintiff's Declaration are OVERRULED.
The Court is not clear as to the nature of Defendant's objections to the Velarde Declaration. Each paragraph to which Defendant objects is an attestation that the document referenced is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be. (See Velarde Decl. Objection.) Defendant objects to the seven paragraphs on the grounds they are (1) hearsay, (2) conclusory, vague, and ambiguous, and (3) lacking foundation. (Id.) Specifically, the Court is unsure whether Defendant objects to the paragraphs of the Velarde Declaration itself or to the admissibility of the documents referenced. As to the former, the objections are OVERRULED. Velarde [*14]  attests he has personal knowledge to the facts he asserts and would testify to those facts if called upon to do so. (Velarde Decl. ¶ 1.) Thus, the paragraphs themselves are not hearsay as Velarde would be able to testify as to his personal knowledge. The paragraphs are also not vague or conclusory. The Court struggles to think of any way Velarde could more clearly or non-conclusorily assert that the documents he attaches are what he purports them to be. Finally, these paragraphs do not lack foundation as Velarde has personal knowledge as to what the documents are, and his declaration establishes the foundation for that knowledge.
As to the latter, the objections are still OVERRULED. At the summary judgment stage, a court focuses on admissibility of the evidence's content, not its form. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Defendant does not explain how the substance of these documents would be inadmissible at trial but instead provide the same three objections to six of the seven documents challenged. As to the documents referenced in paragraphs 16 and 21 of the Velarde Declaration, Defendant submits these exact same documents in its compendium of evidence. (Dkt. 30-9 at 32; Dkt. 30-9 at 6.) For some unknown reason, [*15]  Defendant objects to Plaintiff's attachment of the same. (Velarde Decl. Objection ¶¶ 1, 3.) Defendant also submits an August 2016 version of the same form referenced in paragraph 22 of the Velarde Declaration in its own compendium of evidence. (Dkt. 30-9 at 6.) Again, for some unknown reason, Defendant objects to Plaintiff's attachment of the same form. (Velarde Decl. Objection ¶ 4.) Defendant also submits two of the four Certificates of Professional Care Velarde references in paragraph 24 of his declaration. (Dkt. No. 30-9 at 40.) But Defendant objects to Plaintiff's attachment of the same and the two additional certificates. (Velarde Decl. Objection ¶ 6.) There are two possible take-aways from these objections: (1) Defendant objects to its own evidence or (2) these objections are made in bad faith. The Court finds the latter more consistent with Defendant's conduct throughout this Motion and will not waste its resources considering the objections.
Because the Court finds too many of Defendant's objections are made in bad faith, it will not consider any of Defendant's objections to the Velarde Declaration. Accordingly, all objections to the Velarde Declaration are OVERRULED.

IV. FACTS [*16] 
Except as noted, the following material facts are sufficiently supported by admissible evidence and are uncontroverted. They are "admitted to exist without controversy" for purposes of the Motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); L.R. 56-3.
Defendant is a temporary staffing company that places temporary employees with clients based on their needs.6 (DSUF ¶ 1.) During Plaintiff's employment with Defendant, Jennifer Winkler ("Winkler"), an on-site recruiter, and Cassandra Howdyshell ("Howdyshell"), an on-site manager, were her direct supervisors and managers. (PSUF ¶ 4.)7 Honda North America, Inc. ("Honda") is one of Defendant's clients. (DSUF ¶ 2.) On January 12, 2015, Defendant assigned Plaintiff to work at Honda's Chino Hills facility in a call center. (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.) For the first year of her assignment, Plaintiff worked at an individual station with an L-shaped desk approximately three to four square feet in size. (Id. ¶¶ 5-6.) Plaintiff's alleged medical conditions were not aggravated by this set up. (PSUF ¶¶ 16, 27.) During this time, Plaintiff suffered non-work related migraine headaches. (DSUF ¶ 7.) Plaintiff has experienced migraines since she was approximately 17-years-old. (PSUF ¶ 23.) She has intermittently taken [*17]  migraine medication and sought medical treatment. (Id. ¶ 24.) Plaintiff's symptoms include pain in the lower right side and front of her head, nausea, dizziness, occasional blurred vision, and sensitivity to light and noise. (Id. ¶ 25.) This limited Plaintiff's ability to sleep, concentrate, think, sit, perform manual tasks, and interact with others. (Id. ¶ 29.) Plaintiff was never told to report to work when she felt her migraines made her unable to work. (DSUF ¶ 9.)
On September 18, 2015, Winkler emailed Plaintiff regarding tardies and absences in her attendance record.8 (Id. ¶ 10-11.) On December 1, 2015, Plaintiff received a written warning regarding her attendance.9 (Id. ¶ 13.) The written warning listed a series of dates for which Defendant considered Plaintiff's punctuality and/or attendance to have been an issue. (Id. ¶ 14.) After this warning, Plaintiff did not receive any other notice or warning regarding tardiness or attendance. (PSUF ¶ 11.) On March 29, 2016, Plaintiff received an unsigned final written warning which stated that Plaintiff made inappropriate and unprofessional comments about her team lead and used offensive and derogatory language. (Id. ¶ 13; DSUF ¶¶ 25-26.) [*18]  Plaintiff received no other warnings until she was terminated over one year later.
In January 2016, Honda began a project called "Alpha Team." (Id. ¶ 15.) Plaintiff was promoted to the Alpha Team, and she voluntarily accepted the assignment. (Id. ¶¶ 16-18.) Alpha Team members were relocated to a temporary area near the back wall of the call center. (Id. ¶ 19.) Alpha Team members worked at larger plastic tables where they sat shoulder-to-shoulder. (Id. ¶¶ 20-21; PSUF ¶ 17.) Alpha Team members received a $1/hour raise as a result of these working conditions, or at least in part because of them.10 (DSUF ¶¶ 22-23; PSUF ¶ 17.) Plaintiff claims these conditions aggravated her disabilities. (DSUF ¶ 24.) Plaintiff sought alternative assignments with Honda in order to have better working conditions to no avail. (PSUF ¶ 21.) Defendant assured Plaintiff these conditions were temporary in response to Plaintiff's repeated inquiries regarding when she would get a new work set up. (Id. ¶ 19.)
During this time, Plaintiff complained about her migraines, lower back pain, and insomnia to Winkler and Howdyshell. (Id. ¶¶ 20, 63-65.) No changes were made. (Id. at ¶ 20.) On or about April or May 2016, Plaintiff [*19]  began experiencing insomnia that was worse than bouts of insomnia she had previously experienced. (DSUF ¶¶ 27-28.) Plaintiff informed Winkler and Howdyshell about her insomnia several times from April or May 2016 through February 2017.11 (Id. ¶ 29.) Defendant granted Plaintiff's request for a later start time. (Id. ¶ 32.) During this time, Plaintiff also began to experience severe and chronic pain in her lower back. (PSUF ¶ 32.) This pain made it difficult for Plaintiff to sit, stand, and perform manual tasks. (Id. ¶ 33.) Plaintiff also began to experience severe stress with depression and anxiety affecting her ability to concentrate, sleep, think, and interact with others. (Id. ¶¶ 34-35.)
Plaintiff requested leave after enduring eight months of the Alpha Team working conditions and five months of migraines, insomnia, back pain, and stress. (Id. ¶ 22; DSUF ¶ 31.) In August 2016, Plaintiff requested her first FMLA leave. (DSUF ¶ 33.) This leave request contained FMLA paperwork from Mario Corona ("Corona"), a physician's assistant at Montclair Medical Clinic, stating that Plaintiff suffered from "depression with intermittent, recurrent symptoms, lack of concentration, sadness, crying spells, [*20]  severe headache[s]."12 (Id. ¶ 34.) At all times, Corona worked under Dr. James Lally. (PSUF ¶ 37.) In July 2016, Corona diagnosed Plaintiff with depression and prescribed to her, among other things, Paxil. (Id. ¶ 38.) Corona indicated that Plaintiff required leave from August 15, 2016 until November 15, 2016. (DSUF ¶ 36.) In making this indication, which he believed to be correct, Corona relied on Plaintiff's description of her condition and need for time off work. (Id. ¶ 37.) Two weeks later, Corona noted that Plaintiff's symptoms had worsened. (PSUF ¶ 39.) Corona again diagnosed Plaintiff with depression and prescribed medication to Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 40.) Corona also provided Plaintiff with Imitrex for her migraines and melatonin for her insomnia. (Id. ¶ 41.) On August 26, 2016, Plaintiff filed for unemployment disability with the State of California. (DSUF ¶ 39.) Plaintiff certified her disabilities were not work-related. (Id. ¶ 40.) Corona was unable to file Plaintiff's EDD disability papers because he is a physician's assistant and not a medical doctor. (PSUF ¶ 44.)
Because Plaintiff did not have health insurance, she went to Hawthorne Immediate Healthcare Clinic ("Hawthorne"), a [*21]  low cost medical clinic she knew of in Hawthorne, CA. (Id. ¶ 45.) Joseph Stadish ("Stadish") handled her appointment. (Id. ¶ 47.) Stadish is a chiropractor at Hawthorne who works with Drs. Artis Woodward ("Dr. Woodward") and Patricia Washington ("Dr. Washington").13 (Id.) Stadish's notes from the appointment indicate that Plaintiff and Stadish discussed low back pain, migraine headaches, and severe depression. (Id.) The notes also reflect that Plaintiff explained to Stadish that she was taking antidepressants. (Id.) Finally, Stadish noted Plaintiff's decreased range of motion associated with her back pain. (Id.) In assessing Plaintiff's condition, Stadish relied on Plaintiff's description of her lower back pain and stress. (DSUF ¶¶ 55, 57.) Stadish did not find a source of Plaintiff's back pain other than "muscle spasms." (Id. ¶ 56.) Stadish prepared a note advising Defendant that Plaintiff was unable to perform her duties and needed time off work.14 (Id. ¶ 58.) On August 26, 2016, Dr. Woodward confirmed that Plaintiff was disabled and filed EDD paperwork reflecting the following diagnoses: low back pain, migraine headaches, acute stress reaction, and insomnia. (Id. ¶ 48; DSUF ¶ 60; 8/26/2016 [*22]  EDD Disability Insurance Form.) Plaintiff never consulted directly with Dr. Woodward. (DSUF ¶ 55.)
Despite the determination that Plaintiff should be off work until November 15, 2016, Plaintiff returned to work on October 3, 2016 due to financial reasons. (DSUF ¶ 43.) When Plaintiff returned, the Alpha Team had been moved to a conference room in which the employees were in an even tighter workspace. (PSUF ¶ 52.) Plaintiff complained of these conditions and their effect on her migraines and back pain to Winkler and Howdyshell. (Id. ¶ 53.)
Defendant asserts Plaintiff was able to work through even her worst migraine headaches. (DSUF ¶ 84.) Plaintiff responds by noting that she felt she "had to" work through her pain, and did, until she could not any longer and requested her second leave. (PSUF response to DSUF ¶ 84.) Plaintiff contends that during her employment, she was often only able to sleep 3-4 hours per night 3-4 days a week.15 (DSUF ¶ 86.) Again, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was able to work with her insomnia. (Id. ¶ 87.) And again, Plaintiff responds by noting that she felt she "had to" work through her insomnia, and did, until she could not any longer and requested her second [*23]  leave. (PSUF response to DSUF ¶ 87.)
In February 2017, Plaintiff informed Defendant she needed to take a second leave. (Id. ¶¶ 48-49, 86.) The day after she requested leave, Plaintiff had an appointment with Stadish. (Id. ¶ 50.) Dr. Washington submitted EDD paperwork on Plaintiff's behalf which reflected diagnoses of low back pain, migraine headaches, acute stress reaction, and insomnia. (DSUF ¶¶ 56, 84; 2/9/2017 EDD Disability Insurance Form.) Plaintiff remained off work through February and March 2017. (DSUF ¶ 63.) On March 8, 2017, Plaintiff returned to Hawthorne continuing to complain of her disabilities. (PSUF ¶ 57.) Dr. Woodward confirmed Plaintiff was still unable to work due to the same four disabilities from February. (Id. ¶¶ 58, 85; 3/8/2017 EDD Supplemental Disability Insurance Form.)
Defendant received various documents detailing Plaintiff's alleged disabilities, including doctor notes from Hawthorne, FMLA paperwork from Plaintiff's first leave, a note from Dr. Woodward stating Plaintiff was under his care for a specific medical condition. (PSUF ¶¶ 66-69.) Allegis Benefits ("Allegis"), the benefits administrator for Defendant, prepared an FMLA packet indicating that [*24]  Defendant knew Plaintiff's leave was for her serious health condition.16 (Id. ¶ 73.) Additionally, Plaintiff informed Winkler directly that this second leave was because of the same disabilities that caused her to take her first FMLA leave. (Id. ¶ 74.)
In February 2017, Plaintiff was notified that her FMLA paperwork had been mailed to her but was returned as undeliverable. (DSUF ¶ 64.) Allegis sent the FMLA packet to the wrong address. (PSUF ¶ 78.) Plaintiff received her copy of the FMLA paperwork in the last week of March 2017. (DSUF ¶ 65.) The paperwork Plaintiff received from Allegis17 did not indicate Plaintiff needed to take any action to qualify for FMLA leave. (PSUF ¶ 79.) Specifically, the paperwork never checked the lines indicating that Plaintiff needed to return medical certification or any other documents. (3/2/2017 Allegis Notice to Plaintiff.)
On March 24, 2017, Allegis informed Howdyshell that Plaintiff failed to submit her FMLA paperwork and that Plaintiff's leave was denied. (DSUF ¶ 66.) Howdyshell contacted Horacio Ramirez ("Ramirez"), an Employee Relations Specialist, via email informing him of the FMLA denial.18 (Id. ¶ 67.) Ramirez suggested Howdyshell and Winkler [*25]  try to determine why the FMLA paperwork had not been returned. (Id. ¶ 68.)
Winkler left a message for Plaintiff on March 24, 2017 and reached Plaintiff on April 3, 2017. (Id. ¶ 69.) In the April 3, 2017 conversation, Plaintiff confirmed she received the FMLA paperwork the week prior. (Id. ¶ 70.) The parties dispute whether Winkler instructed Plaintiff to email Allegis after Plaintiff informed her that she could not get anyone to answer the phone or return her calls. But this April 3, 2017 conversation is the first and only time Plaintiff was asked to return FMLA documents signed by her doctors in relation to her second leave. (PSUF ¶ 81, 99.) On April 3, 2017, Allegis informed Howdyshell it still had not received Plaintiff's FMLA paperwork. (DSUF ¶ 73.)
Plaintiff contends that on April 7, 2017, Winkler confirmed it would be okay if Plaintiff waited until her April 10, 2017 doctor appointment to get the FMLA paperwork signed.19 (Id. ¶ 79; PSUF ¶ 99.) Plaintiff also provided a doctor note at Winkler's request. (PSUF ¶ 106.) Also on April 7, 2017, Winkler wrote to Howdyshell and Ramirez stating that Honda approved Plaintiff's termination. (Id. ¶¶ 101, 103.) Winkler also informed Ramirez [*26]  and Howdyshell that she had spoken with Plaintiff and that Plaintiff had an upcoming doctor appointment on April 10, 2017. (Id. ¶¶ 100, 103.) Winkler relayed that Plaintiff said her doctor released her to return to work on Monday April, 10, 2017 and inquired whether Defendant should still proceed with terminating Plaintiff. (Id. ¶¶ 101, 103.) Ramirez informed Howdyshell and Winkler they may terminate Plaintiff's employment unless Honda was willing to accommodate the time off.20 (DSUF ¶ 75.) Honda was not asked for permission or input regarding Plaintiff's termination.21 (PSUF ¶ 104.) On April 8, 2017, Howdyshell terminated Plaintiff's employment. (Id. ¶ 107; DSUF ¶ 78.)
At the time of her termination, Plaintiff was earning $17.46 per hour. (Id. ¶ 89.) Plaintiff sought to replace her employment, with the goal of finding a job paying what she earned at Defendant or more. (PSUF ¶ 116.) She applied to positions paying more and less than what she earned at Defendant and never declined an offer of employment. (Id.) Plaintiff obtained employment at DEX Media from June 5, 2017 until she was terminated on November 21, 2017. (Id. ¶¶ 90, 91.) At DEX Media Plaintiff earned about $21 per [*27]  hour.22 (Id. ¶ 92.) This particular position was in sales, and Plaintiff does not have a sales background. (PSUF ¶ 115.) Plaintiff took this job, despite its differences from her work with Defendant, because she had limited options. (Id.)

V. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden of identifying the elements of the claim or defense and evidence that it believes demonstrates the absence of an issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The moving party must show that "under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
If the moving party has sustained its burden, the nonmoving party must then show that there is a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. The non-moving party must make an affirmative showing on all matters placed in issue by the motion as to which it has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. "This burden is not a light one. The non-moving party must show more than the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252).
A genuine issue of material fact exists "if [*28]  the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. When deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir. 1991). Thus, summary judgment for the moving party is proper when a "rational trier of fact" would not be able to find for the non-moving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).

VI. DISCUSSION

A. Cause of Action 1: Disability Discrimination
The California Supreme Court has adopted the three-step burden-shifting test from McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), for trying claims of discrimination. Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). Step one requires a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Id. If a plaintiff can establish this prima facie case, step two shifts the burden of production to the defendant to provide evidence that the adverse employment action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Id. at 355-356. If the defendant provides evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, step three requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant's proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination. Id.
Defendant contends Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim fails as a matter of law because she cannot establish [*29]  a prima facie case of disability discrimination. (Mot. at 19.) Specifically, Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot establish that she suffered from a disability. (Id. at 20.) Additionally, Defendant argues that even if Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case, she cannot present any triable issues as to whether Defendant's reason for terminating her employment was pretext. (Id. at 24-25.)

1. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, a Plaintiff must provide evidence that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) that she was performing competently in the position she held; (3) that she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) that some other circumstance suggests a discriminatory motive. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355. Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish her prima facie case because she cannot establish that she suffered from a disability. (Mot. at 20.)
FEHA defines a physical disability as a physiological condition that affects one or more body systems, including the neurological and musculoskeletal systems. Cal. Govt. Code § 12926(m)(1)(A). The disability must also limit a major life activity. Id. § 12926(m)(2)(B). "Major life activities" is broadly construed and includes "physical, mental, and social [*30]  activities and working." Id. § 12926(m)(1)(B)(iii). FEHA defines a mental disability as a psychological disorder or condition that limits a major life activity. Id. § 12926(j)(1). "Major life activities" is broadly construed and includes "physical, mental, and social activities and working." Id. § 12926(j)(1)(C). A condition or impairment limits a major life activity if it makes the achievement of the major life activity difficult. Id. § 12926(j)(1)(B), (m)(1)(B)(ii). The accompanying regulations specifically note a disability does not include conditions that are mild or do not limit a major life activity. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(d)(9)(B). California regulations expressly exclude non-migraine headaches. Id. Whether an ailment qualifies as a disability is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Id. The regulations also note that "[m]ajor life activities include, but are not limited to, sleeping, . . . standing, sitting, . . . lifting, . . . bending, . . . concentrating, thinking, . . . interacting with others, and working." Id. § 11065(l)(1).
To show there is a triable issue of fact regarding the impairment of a major life activity, a plaintiff is not required to present medical evidence but may provide her own testimony if it contains sufficient detail to convey the existence of an impairment. Rohr v. Salt River Project Agric. Imp. and Power Dist., 555 F.3d 850, 858-859 (2009).
Under FEHA, not [*31]  every illness qualifies as a disability. Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1249, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008) as modified on denial of reh'g (Aug. 28, 2008). And simply having pain alone does not constitute a disability. Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 348, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008).23 However, short term conditions that do limit a major life activity qualify for protection. Diaz v. Federal Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1051-53 (C.D. Cal. 2005).
Here, Plaintiff establishes a triable issue of fact regarding each of her four purported disabilities: migraines, lower back pain, acute stress, and insomnia.
a. Migraine Headaches
Defendant first argues Plaintiff was not diagnosed with migraine headaches. (Mot. at 21.) California regulations expressly exclude non-migraine headaches from its definition of a disability. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(d)(9)(B). Thus, if Plaintiff cannot create a triable issue of fact as to whether her headaches were migraines, she cannot prevail on any part of her claims arising from her headaches.
Plaintiff has established a triable issue of fact as to whether she suffers from migraine headaches. Contrary to Defendant's assertion, Plaintiff provides much more than "doctors' notes." (See Reply at 7 (citing Jackson v. Kaplan Higher Educ, LLC, 106 F. Supp. 3d 1118, 1125 (E.D. Cal. 2015).) Importantly, Plaintiff presents as evidence her EDD claim forms in which Drs. Woodward and Washington certified under penalty of perjury that Plaintiff's diagnoses included migraine headaches. [*32]  (See 8/26/2016 EDD Disability Insurance Form; 2/9/2017 EDD Disability Insurance Form; 3/8/2017 EDD Supplemental Disability Insurance Form.) These documents alone, without considering Plaintiff's doctors' notes and declaration, quite clearly establish that there is at least a triable issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff was diagnosed with migraine headaches. To request that the Court find Plaintiff was not diagnosed with migraines as a matter of law is to ask that that Court find Drs. Woodward and Washington lied under penalty of perjury. Such a credibility determination is improper at the summary judgment stage. Additionally, Defendant highlights this underlying factual dispute by attacking the quality and rigor of the medical practices resulting in Plaintiff's purported diagnoses. Defendant dedicates significant effort to arguing that Plaintiff was not diagnosed because she did not see directly her "providers" Drs. Washington and Woodward and that Stadish gathered significant information shaping his notes directly from Plaintiff.24 (Mot. at 21; Reply at 7-8.) However, the California regulations expressly define a "[h]ealth care provider" as "a medical or osteopathic doctor . . . who [*33]  directly treats or supervises the treatment of the applicant or employee." 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(i)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, the California regulations themselves contemplate Plaintiff's circumstances, where medical doctors (Drs. Woodward and Washington) supervise the treatment Plaintiff received from Stadish. That Dr. Woodward has previously been disciplined for assisting in the unauthorized practice of medicine and that Stadish has also been disciplined does not establish that such unauthorized practice of medicine occurred here. Defendant's evidence underscores the factual dispute as to whether Plaintiff was diagnosed. Thus, Defendant does not conclusively establish that Plaintiff was not diagnosed with migraine headaches.
Defendant also argues that even if Plaintiff was diagnosed with migraine headaches, she has not established it is a disability because she has not presented evidence that her migraines limited a major life activity.25 (Mot. at 22.) For purposes of surviving summary judgment, a plaintiff does not need to provide medical evidence to establish that her disability limits a major life activity. Rohr, 555 F.3d at 858-59; Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 257-58. California regulations further instruct that "[w]hether an impairment limits a major life activity [*34]  will usually not require scientific, medical, or statistical analysis." 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(l)(3)(B). A plaintiff may provide her own testimony if it contains sufficient detail to convey the existence of an impairment. Rohr, 555 F.3d at 858-59.
Defendant argues "[m]ere susceptibility to migraine headaches is not, without more, sufficient to establish a disability because susceptibility by itself produces no symptoms and is therefore not limiting." (Mot. at 21 (quoting Ellis v. City of Reedley, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25333, 2007 WL 1098571, at *10 (E.D. Cal. 2007).) However, Plaintiff provides evidence she actually suffers from migraines, not that she is merely susceptible to them. As noted above, Plaintiff provides evidence establishing at least a factual dispute as to whether she was diagnosed to have been suffering from migraines. Plaintiff also provides evidence detailing the pain she experiences, which supports this diagnosis. (PSUF ¶ 25.) Specifically, Plaintiff explains that her symptoms include pain in the lower right side and front of her head, nausea, dizziness, occasional blurred vision, and sensitivity to light and noise. (Id. ¶ 25.) Plaintiff provides EDD claim forms in which Drs. Woodward and Washington certify that Plaintiff is unable to work. (See 8/26/2016 EDD Disability Insurance Form; 2/9/2017 EDD Disability [*35]  Insurance Form; 3/8/2017 EDD Supplemental Disability Insurance Form.) California identifies working as a major life activity. Cal. Govt. Code § 12926(m)(1)(B)(iii). Plaintiff also attests that her migraines made it difficult for her to concentrate, think, and interact with others. (PSUF ¶ 35.) Concentrating, thinking, and interacting with others are each considered major life activities. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(l)(1). Plaintiff further explains that she has experienced these migraines since she was approximately 17-years-old and that she has intermittently taken migraine medication and sought medical treatment. (PSUF ¶¶ 23-24.) This evidence raises a material factual dispute as to whether Plaintiff's purported migraines limited a major life activity or were only temporary and mild.
Finally, Defendant argues Plaintiff was able to continue working when her migraines were at their worst. (Mot. at 22.) Defendant does not cite any cases to support its contention that a total inability to work is required to find that Plaintiff has a disability. This is because total inability is not the proper standard for determining that a major life activity is limited under FEHA. The term "limits" includes when a condition "makes the achievement of the major life activity [*36]  difficult." Cal. Govt. Code § 12926(j)(1)(B), (m)(1)(B)(ii). Furthermore, "if the ability to work in some capacity were the test of covered disability, then no disabled person could ever state a FEHA claim ...." Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 5th at 259. Thus, Plaintiff did not need to be totally unable to work or engage in other major life activities for her alleged migraines to limit major life activities.
For these reasons, Defendant has not conclusively established that Plaintiff does not suffer from migraines and that these migraines do not limit a major life activity.
b. Lower Back Pain
Defendant argues Plaintiff's lower back pain is not a disability. (Mot. at 23.) Specifically, Defendant argues that Dr. Woodward did not see Plaintiff directly and that pain resulting from an unspecified condition is not, by itself, a disability. (Id.) As addressed above, that Plaintiff did not see directly her providers Drs. Woodward and Washington does not undisputably establish that she was not diagnosed with lower back pain.
Defendant cites Arteaga for the proposition that pain resulting from an unspecified condition is not, by itself, a disability. 163 Cal. App. 4th at 348. Defendant continues by asserting that Stadish made no attempt to identify the source of Plaintiff's back pain which precludes it [*37]  from being a disability. (Mot. at 23.) Defendant's citation to Arteaga is misleading. The only discussion of FEHA at the citation Defendant provides is that "pain alone does not always constitute or establish a disability." Arteaga, 163 Cal. App. 4th at 348. The discussion makes no reference to an unspecified condition. Instead, Arteaga notes that a court must assess how, if at all, the pain affects a specific plaintiff. Id. The court in Arteaga concluded carpal tunnel did not make work difficult for its particular plaintiff. Id. Thus, Defendant provides no support for its proposition that for lower back pain to qualify as a disability, a provider must identify the source of Plaintiff's pain. Plaintiff provides evidence that her lower back pain affected her ability to sit, stand, and lift. (PSUF ¶¶ 33, 59, 61.) Sitting, standing, and lifting are each considered major life activities. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(l)(1). Thus, Plaintiff has raised a dispute of fact as to whether her purported lower back pain limited a major life activity. For these reasons, Defendant does not conclusively establish that Plaintiff does not suffer from lower back pain and that this pain does not limit a major life activity.
c. Acute Stress
Defendant argues Plaintiff's acute [*38]  stress is not a disability. (Mot. at 23.) Specifically, Defendant argues that "not a single medical professional" identified in evidence ever diagnosed Plaintiff with acute stress. (Id.) Defendant further argues that Plaintiff presents no evidence that Plaintiff's stress limits a major life activity. (Id.)
Plaintiff provides EDD claim forms listing "acute stress" under the diagnosis section. As addressed above, Drs. Woodward and Washington made these representations under penalty of perjury. (See 8/26/2016 EDD Disability Insurance Form; 2/9/2017 EDD Disability Insurance Form; 3/8/2017 EDD Supplemental Disability Insurance Form.) Thus, Plaintiff has at least established there is a triable issue of fact as to whether or not she was diagnosed with acute stress. Plaintiff also points to evidence which supports her contention that her stress limited her ability to work. (PSUF ¶ 22.) Specifically, Plaintiff points to facts supporting her contention that severe stress made her unable to concentrate. (Id. ¶ 34.) Concentrating is a major life activity. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(l)(1). Coupled with her other alleged disabilities, Plaintiff provides evidence that she experienced great difficulty sleeping, thinking, and interacting [*39]  with others. (PSUF ¶ 35.) Each of these is a major life activity. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(l)(1). Thus, Plaintiff has established a dispute of fact as to whether her purported acute stress limited a major life activity. For these reasons, Defendant does not conclusively establish that Plaintiff does not suffer from acute stress and that this acute stress does not limit a major life activity.
d. Insomnia
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish that she suffered from insomnia for the following reasons: (1) many individuals do not receive a full night of sleep; (2) Plaintiff was never diagnosed with insomnia; (3) Plaintiff's loss of sleep was due to "motherhood"; and (4) Plaintiff was able to work with insomnia as she only fell asleep on the job one time because of it. (Mot. at 23.)
First, Defendant's only citation supporting its contention that many individuals do not receive a full night of sleep is to a Fourth Circuit case discussing the ADA. (Id. (citing EEOC v. Sara Lee Corp., 237 F.3d 349, 352 (4th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).) Not only does this argument rest on an interpretation of disability under a different statute, it does not negate Plaintiff's assertion that her loss of sleep was caused by her purported insomnia.
Second, as addressed above, Drs. Woodward [*40]  and Washington each certified under penalty of perjury that their diagnoses included Plaintiff's insomnia. (See 8/26/2016 EDD Disability Insurance Form; 2/9/2017 EDD Disability Insurance Form; 3/8/2017 EDD Supplemental Disability Insurance Form.) These documents alone, not even considering Plaintiff's submitted doctors' notes and declaration, quite clearly establish that there is at least a triable issue as to whether Plaintiff was diagnosed with insomnia.
Third, Defendant's assertion that Plaintiff's claim of reduced sleep is compared to her usual more than eight hours and due to "motherhood" is misleading. The transcript excerpt Defendant's citation to the evidence directly addresses Plaintiff's sleeping patterns before her insomnia developed. (Plaintiff Depo. Vol. 1, 268:23-269:6.) Plaintiff stated that when she started working for Defendant she usually slept eight hours, but fewer on occasion due to responsibilities at home. (Id.) This does not establish as a matter of law that Plaintiff's later difficulty sleeping was not caused by insomnia.
Fourth, Defendant argues Plaintiff was able to continue working with her insomnia. (Mot. at 23.) Specifically, Defendant notes Plaintiff only [*41]  once fell asleep on the job because of it. (Id.) Defendant does not cite any cases to support its contention that a total inability to work is required to find that Plaintiff has a disability. This is because total inability is not the proper standard for determining that a major life activity is limited under FEHA. The term "limits" includes when a condition "makes the achievement of the major life activity difficult." Cal. Govt. Code § 12926(j)(1)(B), (m)(1)(B)(ii). Furthermore, "if the ability to work in some capacity were the test of covered disability, then no disabled person could ever state a FEHA claim ...."
Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 5th at 259. Thus, Plaintiff did not need to be totally unable to work or engage in other major life activities for her alleged insomnia to limit major life activities. Furthermore, Plaintiff's insomnia-related incident, in which she fell asleep on the job, supports Plaintiff's contention that her insomnia limited her ability to concentrate, think, and work.
Thus, Plaintiff established a dispute of fact as to whether her purported insomnia limited a major life activity. For these reasons, Defendant cannot show as a matter of law that Plaintiff does not suffer from insomnia and that this insomnia does not limit a major life activity. [*42]  Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff established triable issues of fact as to whether she was disabled under FEHA. Defendant does not present other arguments as to why Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination.

2. Defendant's Reason for Terminating Plaintiff
The parties do not dispute Defendant offered a non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment: Plaintiff did not return the necessary paperwork to support her second FMLA leave. (Mot. at 24; Opp'n at 21.) Instead, the parties dispute whether Defendant's purported reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment was pretextual. (Opp'n at 21.)

3. Whether Defendant's Reason for Terminating Plaintiff Was Pretext
Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot establish the offered nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her employment was pretextual. (Mot. at 25.) Once an employer established a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for termination, to "'avoid summary judgment . . ., an employee claiming discrimination must offer substantial evidence that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual, or evidence the employer acted with a discriminatory [*43]  animus, or a combination of the two, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer engaged in intentional discrimination.'" Wills v. Superior Court, 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 160, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011) (citation omitted); King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 433, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007) (The discharged employee seeking to avert summary judgment "must produce substantial responsive evidence to show that [the employer's] ostensible motive was pretextual; that is, that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or that the employer's explanation is unworthy of credence."). The plaintiff must demonstrate "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence, . . . and hence infer that the employer did not act for the [. . . asserted] nondiscriminatory reasons." Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 75, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000) (citation omitted); Villanueva v. City of Colton, 160 Cal. App. 4th 1188, 1195, 73 Cal. Rptr. 3d 343 (2008). Circumstantial evidence must be "specific and substantial." Morgan, 88 Cal. App. 4th at 69; Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal Inc., 292 F.3d 654, 661 (9th Cir. 2002).
Plaintiff does not present evidence that might establish the reason for her termination was pretextual and instead motivated by discriminatory animus. Based on the evidence currently before the Court, it appears Plaintiff's FMLA leave paperwork was mishandled by Allegis. But Defendant [*44]  had no reason to know of any such mishandling. Plaintiff did not receive her FMLA paperwork until the last week of March 2017. (DSUF ¶ 65.) This paperwork sent to her by Allegis did not indicate Plaintiff needed to take any action to qualify for FMLA leave. (PSUF ¶ 79.) The paperwork sent to Plaintiff did not check the lines indicating Plaintiff needed to return any medical certification or other documents for her leave request to be approved. (3/2/2017 Allegis Notice to Plaintiff.) On March 24, 2017, Allegis informed Howdyshell that Plaintiff failed to submit required FMLA paperwork and that her request for FMLA leave was denied. (DSUF ¶ 66.) Plaintiff contacted Ramirez to inform him of this update. (Id. ¶ 67.) Ramirez suggested that Howdyshell and Winkler try to determine why the paperwork was not returned. (Id. ¶ 68.) Winkler was able to contact Plaintiff on April 3, 2017, and Plaintiff told Winkler she had received the FMLA paperwork the week prior. (Id. ¶ 70.) Plaintiff offers no evidence that she informed Winkler or any other supervisor that her FMLA paperwork indicated she did not need to return documentation for her leave to be approved.
During the April 3, 2017 conversation, [*45]  Winkler requested that Plaintiff submit documentation signed by her doctors. (PSUF ¶¶ 81, 99.) This was the first time Plaintiff was asked to submit such documentation. (Id.) Plaintiff contends that Winkler agreed that it would be okay if Plaintiff submitted this paperwork after her April 10, 2017 doctor's appointment. (DSUF ¶ 79.) California law instructs that an employee has 15 days to comply with such a request. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11091(b)(3). Plaintiff was terminated the next day, on April 8, 2017. (DSUF ¶ 78.) Thus, Plaintiff raises a factual issue as to whether her termination was proper and in compliance with California regulations. But she does not establish any discriminatory animus. Plaintiff does not provide evidence showing that Winkler knew this was the first request for Plaintiff to submit documentation. Furthermore, Plaintiff fails to cite evidence showing Howdyshell, who terminated Plaintiff, knew Winkler allegedly told Plaintiff to wait until April 10, 2017 to submit her signed documentation. Plaintiff presents no evidence to undermine Defendant's assertion that its decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment was based on the fact that Plaintiff's FMLA request was denied for failure to submit [*46]  the required paperwork. This is true even if Allegis was mistaken in denying Plaintiff's leave request and relaying that denial to Howdyshell.
Plaintiff's arguments in her Opposition cannot overcome this critical deficiency. That Defendant's reason for terminating Plaintiff is intertwined with her disability is unavailing. The Court recognizes that intertwinement can be helpful circumstantial evidence of pretext where the proffered reason for termination and protected activity are connected. See Soria v. Univision Radio Los Angeles, Inc., 5 Cal. App. 4th 570, 594 (2016). The plaintiff in Soria was terminated for attendance reasons connected to her disability related absences as she sought medical treatment. Id. The discussion in Soria directly addressed the plaintiff's discrete tardies and absences and explained that her employer may have known the attendance issues were related to medical appointments. Id. Here, Plaintiff's two-month absence is admittedly "intertwined" with her purported disabilities in that she had requested FMLA leave. However, in this action, such circumstantial evidence is not persuasive. In order to protect her disability-related leave, Plaintiff was required to comply with FMLA leave procedures. Plaintiff points to no evidence undermining [*47]  that Defendant reasonably believed Plaintiff had failed to file the requested documentation. The Court further notes that intertwinement is inherent in any dispute involving termination after denying an FMLA leave request. Without more, the circumstantial value of intertwinement is minimal here. To infer discriminatory intent from these facts would prevent summary judgment in any case where a defendant terminates an employee for failing to provide requested documentation.
The Court also acknowledges that the proximity in time of a termination and protected activity, in combination with other evidence, can be circumstantial evidence of pretext. Diego v. Pilgrim United Church of Christ, 231 Cal. App. 4th 913, 932, 180 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2014). Plaintiff asserts that because her termination was concurrent with her protected activity, disability leave, it raises an inference of pretext. (Opp'n at 22.) Again, the circumstantial value of the timing of Plaintiff's termination is minimal. It is minimal because Plaintiff does not present any evidence to show that Defendant had reason to believe Plaintiff's leave was protected. In Diego, the plaintiff was terminated shortly after her employer developed a mistaken belief that plaintiff had lodged a complaint with the State Department of Social [*48]  Services, a protected activity. 231 Cal. App. 4th at 917, 932. Thus supported an inference of discriminatory animus. Id. at 932. Here, however, Plaintiff's concurrent termination during her requested FMLA leave does not support a discriminatory animus. Unlike in Diego, Defendant here provides evidence it reasonably believed Plaintiff's activity was not protected, and Plaintiff provides no evidence to the contrary. To infer discriminatory intent from these facts would preclude summary judgment in any case where a defendant terminates an employee after she fails to provide requested documentation supporting her extended absence.
Plaintiff asserts there are inconsistencies with Defendant's assertion that Plaintiff's performance was poor and that this supports an inference of pretext. (Opp'n at 22.) Defendant does not provide performance deficiencies as its reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment. (Mot. at 24.) In fact, despite including information about Plaintiff's disciplinary record, Defendant does not contend that Plaintiff's performance while working for Defendant was poor.
Plaintiff further contends there is circumstantial evidence of pretext because the reason given for her termination conflicts with other evidence. [*49]  (Opp'n at 22 (citing Mamou v. Trendwest Resorts, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 686, 715, 81 Cal. Rptr. 3d 406 (2008).) Specifically, Plaintiff contends the errors in the FMLA paperwork she received were Defendant's fault. (Id.) This contention, that Defendant was itself responsible for the mishandling of Plaintiff's FMLA paperwork, lacks any support in the evidence currently before the Court. Plaintiff's own compilation of evidence includes the FMLA paperwork which shows it originated from Allegis, not Defendant. (3/2/2017 Allegis Notice to Plaintiff.) Thus, the Court does not give any weight to Plaintiff's contention that Defendant created the offending FMLA paperwork.
Finally, Plaintiff contends Howdyshell, Winkler, and Ramirez each knew of Plaintiff's purported disabilities and acted in concert to terminate her is persuasive circumstantial evidence of pretext. (Opp'n at 22 (citing Mamou, 165 Cal. App. 4th at 715).) The fact that Howdyshell, Winkler, and Ramirez were in contact regarding Plaintiff's purported disabilities and corresponded before Howdyshell terminated Plaintiff's employment is not persuasive here. It is unpersuasive because in order to terminate Plaintiff's employment for failing to submit the requested FMLA documentation, Defendant had to know Plaintiff was seeking FMLA leave. Furthermore, [*50]  as noted above, Defendant presents evidence that Howdyshell, Winkler, and Ramirez each believed Plaintiff's activity was not protected for her failure to submit required documentation, and Plaintiff provides no evidence to the contrary.
None of Plaintiff's circumstantial evidence could convince a reasonable juror that Defendant acted with a discriminatory animus in terminating Plaintiff's employment because none of Plaintiff's evidence undermines Defendant's contention that it believed Plaintiff's second leave was not protected. Thus, Plaintiff submitted no evidence to establish Defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her employment was pretextual. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion on the claim of disability discrimination.

B. Cause of Action 2: Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot establish Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process because Plaintiff cannot establish she has a disability. (Mot. at 28.) As addressed above, Plaintiff has established a triable issue as to whether she suffers from each of her four purported disabilities.
Additionally, Defendant asserts it did engage in the interactive [*51]  process but Plaintiff's failure to communicate with Allegis regarding the status of her leave paperwork terminated the interactive process. (Id.) Plaintiff argues Defendant's termination of her employment wrongfully ended the interactive process. (Opp'n at 23.)
The interactive process requires that an employer engage in timely, good faith consideration of an employee's requested accommodation. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11069(c)(1). An employer's duty to engage in the interactive process ends once a reasonable accommodation is provided. Id. § 11069(c)(8). If an employer rejects a requested accommodation, it must initiate discussion with the applicant or employee regarding an alternative accommodation. Id. § 11069(c)(1). An employer may request that an employee provide reasonable medical documentation of her disability. Id. § 11069(c)(2). An employee must also cooperate in good faith, including providing reasonable medical documentation as requested by her employer. Id. § 11069(d). If an employee provides insufficient documentation or the documentation provided does not support any reasonable accommodation, no reasonable accommodation is required. Id. § 11069(d)(6). In assessing a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process, courts isolate the cause of the breakdown, assign [*52]  responsibility, and then hold the employer liable only if it is responsible for the breakdown. Rezvan v. Philips Electronics North Am. Corp., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173734, 2016 WL 8193160, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2016) (citing Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 985, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008)).
This case presents a difficult issue because it seems as though Allegis, rather than Plaintiff or Defendant, was the driving force behind the breakdown of the interactive process. California model jury instructions provide helpful guidance. The model jury instruction list the following elements for a claim of failure to engage in the interactive process: (1) plaintiff is an individual with a mental or physical disability; (2) a reasonable accommodation to these limitations was available at the time the interactive process occurred or should have occurred that would have permitted plaintiff to perform the essential functions of the job; (3) either defendant knew of the disability or plaintiff made the disability known to the defendant; (4) plaintiff in good faith requested that defendant engage in an interactive process to determine a reasonable accommodation for the disability; (5) defendant failed to engaged timely in good faith in this interactive process; (6) defendant's failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss, or harm. CACI No. 2546 (emphasis added). Here, Defendant [*53]  was informed Plaintiff failed to submit properly requested paperwork and that her requested FMLA leave was denied because of that failure. (DSUF ¶ 66.) Defendant then terminated Plaintiff's employment. As addressed above, Plaintiff did not present any evidence Defendant knew of the errors Allegis made in preparing Plaintiff's FMLA paperwork or that Defendant knew Plaintiff was never asked to provide medical certification supporting her leave. Thus, Plaintiff provides no evidence for which a reasonable juror could conclude that Defendant did not act timely or in good faith in the interactive process before it terminated Plaintiff's employment, a necessary element of her claim.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion on the claim of failure to engage in the interactive process.

C. Cause of Action 3: Failure to Accommodate a Disability
To establish a claim for failure to accommodate a disability, a plaintiff must prove (1) she is disabled; (2) she is a qualified individual; and (3) the defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 256. At the summary judgment stage, a defendant cannot prevail unless it establishes that a reasonable accommodation was offered and refused [*54]  or that it did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation but the interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith. Diaz, 373 F. Supp. 2d at 1054-55 (citing Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 263).
Defendant contends Plaintiff cannot establish she has a disability. (Mot. at 28.) As addressed above, Plaintiff established a triable issue of fact as to whether she has each of her four purported disabilities.
Defendant further contends Plaintiff cannot show Defendant failed to accommodate her because it gave Plaintiff her requested time off and simply asked for supporting paperwork. (Mot. at 28.) Plaintiff responds that Defendant cannot show that it did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation for Plaintiff. (Opp'n at 23.)
First, Defendant cannot show Plaintiff refused an offer of reasonable accommodation. Defendant offered a reasonable accommodation to Plaintiff in finding she was eligible for FMLA leave. (3/2/2017 Allegis Notice to Plaintiff.) See Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F. 3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 1999). Based on the evidence currently before the Court, Defendant was informed Plaintiff had been instructed to provide medical certification and that she did not in fact do so. (DSUF ¶ 66.) But Plaintiff presents evidence she was not [*55]  aware that she was required to submit any supporting documentation until April 3, 2017, creating a triable issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff "refused" the accommodation.
Second, Defendant also cannot establish that it did "everything in its power" to find a reasonable accommodation or that the interactive process broke down because Plaintiff failed to engaged in discussions in good faith. Defendant must establish each of these to prevail at the summary judgment stage. See Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 266-67. In determining whether an employer "did everything in its power," courts look to what caused the breakdown in the interactive process. See Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 265; Perez v. Proctor and Gamble Mfg. Co., 161 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1123-24 (E.D. Cal. 2001). As part of its reasonable accommodation inquiry, Defendant was permitted to request supporting paperwork. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11069(c)(2). California regulations instruct that if a plaintiff provides insufficient documentation, an employer must provide reasonable accommodation only to the extent reasonable accommodation is supported by documentation provided. Id. § 11069(d)(6). If the documentation provided does not support any reasonable accommodation, no reasonable accommodation is required. Id. In this process, an employee must cooperate in good faith with her employer, which includes providing reasonable documentation [*56]  requested. Id. § 11069(d). It is a reasonable inference that a plaintiff who, through no fault of her own, fails to comply with medical documentation requests has still met her burden to cooperate in good faith.
Unlike a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process, an employer's liability for failure to make a reasonable accommodation does not turn on its timely, good faith efforts alone. See CACI No. 2541 (listing the following elements: (1) plaintiff is an individual with a mental or physical disability; (2) plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation; (3) plaintiff requested defendant to provide a reasonable accommodation; (4) defendant knew of the disability; (5) defendant failed to reasonably accommodate plaintiff's disability; and (6) defendant's failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss, or harm) (emphasis added). An employer's superior knowledge of its own workplace is important in identifying how an employee might be reasonably accommodated. Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 263, 265-66. Thus, in determining whether an employer did "everything in its power" to find a reasonable accommodation, the Court finds a defendant's superior knowledge of its own [*57]  workplace creates an obligation on the employer that may exceed its timely, good faith obligation during the interactive process.
For a failure to accommodate claim, the Court considers whether "a reasonable juror could . . . conclude that, given the circumstances, [Defendant] was obligated to do more." Perez, 161 F. Supp. 2d at 1124. As addressed above, Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant did not engage in the interactive process, as Plaintiff does not present evidence Defendant knew Plaintiff was not instructed before April 3, 2017 that she needed to submit a medical certification. But this does not necessarily mean Defendant could not have done more than it did.
First, Defendant cannot establish that Plaintiff failed to submit medical certification documents in bad faith. Plaintiff contends that upon Winkler's request she submit medical certification—purportedly the first such request Plaintiff received—Winkler clarified that Plaintiff could turn in the certification after her April 10, 2017 return. (DSUF ¶ 79.) Plaintiff also provided a doctor note at Winkler's request. (PSUF ¶ 106.) Thus, Defendant cannot establish that Plaintiff failed to engaged in discussions in good faith.
Second, Defendant cannot prove [*58]  that it could not have done more to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff provides evidence that Winkler knew Plaintiff would secure her medical certification on April 10, 2017. (Id. ¶ 99.) Winkler also informed her colleagues Plaintiff was released to work starting April 10, 2017 and expressly asked if the termination should still proceed. (Id. ¶¶ 101, 103.) Ramirez replied to all and explained the termination could proceed unless Honda accommodated the time off. (Id. ¶ 101.) The next day Howdyshell terminated Plaintiff's employment. (Id. ¶ 107.) Previously, on March 24, 2017—the first time Allegis informed Defendant that Plaintiff had not submitted required paperwork—Ramirez suggested that Winkler and Howdyshell try to determine why the paperwork had not been submitted. (DSUF ¶ 68.) But Defendant presents no evidence that Winkler or Howdyshell actually tried to determine why the paperwork was never filed. The only evidence before the Court suggests that Winkler learned Plaintiff was returning to work the next week, asked Plaintiff to submit the medical certification, and confirmed that Plaintiff could submit the certification following her April 10, 2017 appointment. [*59]  Thus, Defendant's own previous conduct suggests at least one effort that could have identified Allegis's failures—asking Plaintiff why the paperwork was not submitted. This may have been quite helpful in identifying the erroneous paperwork, as Plaintiff provided medical certification to support her first FMLA leave. (PSUF ¶ 83.) Defendant also could have asked Allegis for a copy of the FMLA packet sent to Plaintiff. Defendant has superior knowledge of Allegis's practices and processes as well as superior access to Allegis's files and personnel. But there is no evidence that Defendant took any steps to review any of Allegis's conduct before terminating Plaintiff's employment. Thus, Defendant cannot prove it did "everything in its power" to find a reasonable accommodation. Diaz, 373 F. Supp. 2d at 1054-55. A reasonable juror could find that "given the circumstances, [Defendant] was obligated to do more." See Perez, 161 F. Supp. 2d at 1124.
Accordingly, summary judgment is inappropriate for this claim. The Court DENIES summary judgment on the claim of failure to accommodate a disability.

D. Cause of Action 4 & 5: Retaliation for Exercising Rights to Take Protected Leave in Violation of CFRA and FEHA and Retaliation under FEHA
To establish a prima facie [*60]  case of retaliation under FEHA, a plaintiff must show: (1) she engaged in a "protected activity," (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action. Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). If a plaintiff establishes a prime facie case, her employer is required to offer a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. If the employer provides a non-retaliatory reason, the employee must prove intentional retaliation. Id. This same approach applies to claims of retaliation for taking CFRA leave. See Striplin v. Shamrock Foods Co., Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39680, 2016 WL 1165873, at *1, *5 (CD. Cal. Mar. 24, 2016).
Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation for taking leave under FEHA or CFRA. (Mot. at 28.) Specifically, Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot show a causal link between Plaintiff's leave requests and her termination. (Id. at 28-29.) Additionally, Defendant argues it terminated Plaintiff's employment for a non-discriminatory purpose and that Plaintiff cannot establish that such a reason was pretext. (Id. 29.) Plaintiff contends Defendant "interfered with and/or retaliated against her" because she requested medical leave and cites to the timing problems with [*61]  terminating Plaintiff's employment five days after the first request for medical on April 3, 2017. (Opp'n at 23.)
Plaintiff conflates compliance with California regulations giving Plaintiff 15 days to respond to a first request for medical certification and retaliation.26 As addressed above, Plaintiff provides no evidence that Howdyshell, Winkler, or Ramirez knew Plaintiff had never been asked to provide medical certification or that April 3, 2017 was the first request for Plaintiff's medical certification. And the week before Plaintiff's termination, Defendant's benefits administrator, Allegis, informed Howdyshell that Plaintiff's leave request was denied for failing to submit required documentation. (DSUF ¶ 66.) Plaintiff provides no evidence to show Defendant had reason to believe her second leave was protected. Thus, even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of retaliation, she does not offer evidence to show Defendant terminated her employment with retaliatory intent.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion on the claims of retaliation.

E. Cause of Action 6: Failure to Prevent Disability Discrimination
To prevail on a claim for failure to prevent [*62]  discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must show "(1) [she] was subjected to discrimination; (2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination; and (3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." See Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 804 (N.D. Cal. 2015). Courts have interpreted "a failure to prevent discrimination claim [to be] essentially derivative of a [FEHA] discrimination claim." Id.; Ravel v. Hewlett-Packard Enter., Inc., 228 F. Supp. 3d 1086, 1098 (E.D. Cal. 2017).
Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot establish her claim for failure to prevent disability discrimination because she cannot establish that she was discriminated against. (Mot. at 29.) The Court agrees. As addressed above, Plaintiff's discrimination claim fails. Thus, Plaintiff's claim for failure to prevent disability discrimination also fails.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion on the claim of failure to prevent disability discrimination.

F. Cause of Action 7: Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
"The central assertion of a claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy is that the employer's motives for terminating the employee are so contrary to fundamental norms that the termination inflicted an injury sounding in tort." Roby v. McKesson Corp., 47 Cal. 4th 686, 702, 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 773, 219 P.3d 749 (2009). The California Supreme Court cautions [*63]  that "courts in wrongful discharge actions may not declare public policy without a basis in either constitutional or statutory provisions .... [T]he public policy exception presents no impediment to employers that operate within the bounds of law." Gantt v. Sentry Insurance, 1 Cal. 4th 1083, 1094, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 874, 824 P.2d 680 (1992), overruled on other grounds by Green v. Ralee Engineering Co., 19 Cal. 4th 66, 80 n.6, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (1998). "To support a wrongful discharge claim, the policy must be (1) delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) public in the sense that it inures to the benefit of the public rather than serving merely the interests of the individual; (3) well established at the time of the discharge; and (4) substantial and fundamental." Phillips v. St. Mary Reg'l Med. Ctr., 96 Cal. App. 4th 218, 226, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 770 (2002). "Where no predicate violation of the law has occurred, a plaintiff cannot state a claim for wrongful termination in violation of the law." See Ramirez v. AvalonBay Cmtys., Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130475, 2015 WL 5675866, at *11 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2015) (citing Green, 19 Cal. 4th at 79).
Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot establish a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy because she cannot establish a potential violation of an underlying statute. (Mot. at 29 (citing Sequoia Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 13 Cal. App. 4th 1472, 1475, 16 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888 (1993).) As addressed above, Plaintiff's failure to accommodate a disability claim survives summary judgment, establishing potential for a violation of an underlying statute. Defendant presents no other argument as to why [*64]  Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim should fail. (See Mot. at 29-30.)
Accordingly, summary judgment is inappropriate for this claim. The Court DENIES summary judgment on the claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy.

G. Emotional Distress
Defendant argues Plaintiff has no claims for emotional distress because they are preempted by the Workers' Compensation Act ("WCA"). (Mot. at 30.) Defendant further argues "Plaintiff's interrogatory responses establish that her emotional distress claim" is comprised of distress she suffered from working conditions during her employment. (Reply at 14.) The Court notes Plaintiff does not allege a single "emotional distress claim" in her Complaint. (See generally, Compl.)
Each case Defendant cites in support of its proposition that Plaintiff's "emotional distress claims" are preempted by the WCA expressly addresses a distinct cause of action for either intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress untethered from other alleged violations. See Miklosy v. Regents of Univ. of Calif., 44 Cal. 4th 876, 902, 80 Cal. Rptr. 3d 690, 188 P.3d 629 (2008); Livitsanos v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. 4th 744, 747, 7 Cal. Rptr. 2d 808, 828 P.2d 1195 (1992); Shoemaker v. Myers, 52 Cal. 3d 1, 25, 276 Cal. Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054 (1990); Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., 43 Cal. 3d 148, 159-61, 233 Cal. Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743 (1987). The California Supreme Court holds that "FEHA . . . claims fall outside the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions . . ." of the WCA. See Charles J. Vacanti, M.D., Inc. v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, 24 Cal. 4th 800, 817, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 562, 14 P.3d 234 (2001); City of Moorpark v. Superior Court, 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1158, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752 (1998). Thus, Plaintiff's FEHA claims, and the emotional distress damages [*65]  she contends those purported violations caused, are not preempted by the WCA.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES summary judgment as Plaintiff's "emotional distress claims."

H. Lost Wages
Defendant argues Plaintiff has no claim for lost wages because she did not seek comparable employment following her termination. (Mot. at 31.)
Under California law, "an employee who has been wrongfully terminated has a duty to mitigate damages through reasonable efforts to achieve other employment." Boehm v. American Broadcasting Co., Inc., 929 F.2d 482, 485 (9th Cir. 1991). Failure to "accept offers of employment is significant in consideration of mitigation only if the former employer shows 'that the other employment was comparable, or substantially similar, to that of which the employee has been deprived.'" Id. A defendant has the burden of proof to show that a plaintiff did not mitigate her losses. Id. In determining whether the employment was "comparable or substantially similar," a court may consider whether: (1) the nature was different from plaintiff's employment with defendant; (2) the new position was substantially inferior to plaintiff's former position; (3) the salary, benefits, and hours of the job were similar to plaintiff's former job; (4) the new position required [*66]  similar skills, background, and experience; (5) the job responsibilities were similar; or (6) the job was in the same locality. See Villacorta v. Cemex Cement, Inc., 221 Cal. App. 4th 1425, 1429, 165 Cal. Rptr. 3d 441 (2013).
Here, Defendant cannot meet its burden of proving as a matter of law that Plaintiff failed to mitigate her damages. Plaintiff earned $17.46 per hour when her employment was terminated. (DSUF ¶ 89.) After her termination, Plaintiff sought jobs paying as much as she earned while working for Defendant. (Id. ¶ 93.) Plaintiff eventually retained a sales position at DEX Media earning $21 per hour. (Id. ¶ 92.) Plaintiff was terminated from that for performance reasons. (Id. ¶ 91.) However, Defendant carries the burden of persuasion and fails to proffer evidence of suitable positions available. Additionally, that Plaintiff's goal was to make at least $17.46 per hour does not prove Plaintiff did not also seek jobs paying slightly less than what she earned while working for Defendant. Finally, Plaintiff presents evidence that she applied for a high volume of jobs, many paying less than $17 per hour. (PSUF ¶ 116.) Plaintiff also presents evidence that she never declined any offers of employment. (Id.) Thus, Plaintiff presents a triable issue of fact as to whether [*67]  she mitigated her damages.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES summary judgment as to Plaintiff's lost wages.

I. Punitive Damages
Defendant argues Plaintiff has no claim for punitive damages because she cannot establish malice or that Howdyshell, Winkler, or Ramirez were Defendant's officers, directors, or managing agents. (Mot. at 31-32.) Plaintiff argues there are factual disputes as to malice, whether Ramirez, Winkler, and/or Howdyshell were "managing agents," and whether Defendant ratified Plaintiff's termination. (Opp'n at 25.)
California Civil Code Section 3294(a) permits a plaintiff to recover exemplary damages where she proves by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant was guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. However, an employer is not liable for exemplary damages based on the acts of its employees unless it ratified the wrongful conduct or was personally guilty of the oppression, fraud, or malice. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(b). With respect to a corporate employer, an offending ratification must have been made by an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation. Id. A "managing agent" of a corporation is someone "'who exercise[s] substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy.'" Roby v. McKesson Corp., 47 Cal. 4th 686, 714, 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 773, 219 P.3d 749 (2009) [*68]  (quoting White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 563, 573, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999)). "[C]orporate policy" refers to "formal policies that affect a substantial portion of the company and that are the type likely to come to the attention of corporate leadership." Id. at 715. The California Supreme Court noted "this sort of broad authority . . . justifies punishing an entire company for an otherwise isolated act of oppression, fraud, or malice." Id.
Here, Plaintiff provides no evidence that Howdyshell, Winkler, or Ramirez had discretionary power to determine any corporate policies. There is no evidence before the Court that any of these three had broad authority that would justify punishing the entire company for their acts. Moreover, Plaintiff admits Howdyshell, Winkler, and Ramirez were not officers or directors of Defendant nor did they have any substantial discretionary authority over Defendant's policies. (DSUF ¶¶ 96-105.) Thus, no reasonable juror could find that Howdyshell, Winkler, or Ramirez were "managing agents." Thus, without a managing agent, there cannot be a qualifying ratification. Because neither Howdyshell, Winkler, or Ramirez are managing agents, the Court does not need to determine if Plaintiff presents a triable issue of fact as to whether their conduct was "malicious."
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to Plaintiff's punitive damages.

VII. CONCLUSION
For the reasons above, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action against Defendant. [*69]  The Court also GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's punitive damages. The Court DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's third and seventh causes of action against Defendant. The Court also DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's emotional distress damages and lost wages.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
