MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
P. KEVIN CASTEL, District Judge:
The plaintiff contends that she was subject to unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of race and disability, and was subsequently retaliated against for filing an internal complaint asserting the same. She brings claims pursuant to the Americans with Disability Act (the "ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"), N.Y. Exec. L. § 290, et seq., and the New York City Human Rights Law ("NYCHRL"), N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-101. et seq. The defendant now moves for summary judgment. For the reasons explained below, defendant's motion is granted as to plaintiffs claims asserting discrimination on the basis of race and disability,  [*2] but denied as to her retaliation claims.
BACKGROUND
Except where expressly noted, the following facts are either undisputed or taken from the plaintiffs' version of the facts. All reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the plaintiff who is, on defendant's motion, the non-movant. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
1. The Plaintiff's Claims of Discrimination Based on Race.
The plaintiff is an African-American woman. (Def. 56.5 P 1; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 1.) From October 3, 2005 to April 6, 2007, she was employed by the defendant as executive director of the Child Support Collection Unit (the "CSCU") in the Office of Child Support and Enforcement (the "OCSE"). (Def. 56.1 P 2; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 2.) The CSCU oversaw collection and distribution of child support payments consistent with state and federal regulation. (Def. 56.1 P 4; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 4.) The plaintiff was responsible for supervising activities in OCSE's fiscal division, including establishment of child-support accounts and preparation of account statements. (Def. 56.1 P 4; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 4.) Plaintiff was interviewed and subsequently hired by Frank Olton, the assistant deputy commissioner of the OCSE. (Def.  [*3] 56.1 P 3; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 3.)
The plaintiff supervised five staffers with the job title of "director," and was herself supervised by Olton. (Def. 56.1 P 6; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 6.) Among those reporting to the plaintiff was Yosef Fouks, whose job title was director of finance. (Def. 56.1 P 7; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 7.) Fouks is white. (Def. 56.1 P 7; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 7.) The plaintiff believed that Fouks failed to carry out his job responsibilities, and, on multiple occasions, communicated with Olton about her displeasure with Fouks. (Def. 56.1 P 8; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 8.) Plaintiff particularly objected to Fouks's use of profanity and suggested to Olton that Fouks be suspended due to his foul language. (Def. 56.1 P 10; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 10; Julius Dep. at 80.) Olton told the plaintiff to document her concerns in writing, though the plaintiff repeatedly contends this instruction was fruitless because Olton rewrote a critical employee review of Fouks to be more favorable. (Def. 56.1 P 9; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 9.)
Olton told the plaintiff that he was concerned about her interactions with Fouks, including a meeting between plaintiff, Fouks and colleagues that "reached the level of yelling." (Fay Dec. Ex.  [*4] D) Olton later told plaintiff that if she had concerns about Fouks's use of profanity, "[h]e should be told calmly and firmly that he cannot act that way," or otherwise "should be told in writing." (Fay Dec. Ex. E.) Olton conducted a meeting with plaintiff and Fouks on October 2006, and subsequently sent them both a memo outlining suggested best practices going forward. (Def. 56.1 P 16; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 16; Fay Dec. Ex. F.) Also following the meeting, the plaintiff wrote to a commissioner and an attorney of the Human Resources Administration to complain that Olton allowed Fouks to disrespect her and that Fouks and Olton undermined her because she is African American. (Def. 56.1 P 17; Pl. 56.1 Resp. PP 16, 17; Wade Dec. Ex. 4.)
On November 1, 2006, the plaintiff addressed an e-mail to Olton, stating her belief that Olton had "no intention of resolving the [Fouks] issue." (Def. 56.1 P 18; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 18.) Olton responded with a memo stating that plaintiffs e-mail had been unprofessional, that on other occasions the plaintiff had been addressed about her unprofessional communication and that any of plaintiff s concerns about Fouks's performance must be formalized in writing. (Def.  [*5] 56.1 P 18; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 18; Fay Dec. Ex. J.) In the Complaint, the plaintiff asserts that "Foulk [sic] having made racist remarks mixed in with contemporary American profanity centering on a person having sexual relation with their mother" was not reprimanded, and was instead transferred "to another department without Plaintiff's knowledge in the dark of night." (Compl. P 12 (emphasis in original).) She alleges that she experienced discrimination "because she dared to reprimand a white-male for unacceptable and hostile behavior in the workplace." (Compl. P 21.)
2. The Plaintiffs Claims of Discrimination Based on Disability.
The plaintiff has asthma, the symptoms of which are triggered by damp or moldy environments. (Def. 56.1 P 26; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 26.) The plaintiff spoke with her office manager about the negative health effects of her work location, asked for a machine to filter the air and requested carpet shampooing for her office. (Def. 56.30 1 P 27; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 27.) In June 2006, she submitted a written request for improvement in the workplace air quality. (Def. 56.1 P 28; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 28.) In the request, plaintiff wrote, "Vents old [and] dirty in office. Carpets old,  [*6] dusty dirty cannot be cleaned properly [without] a strong filter system." (Def. 56.1 P 28; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 28.)
The plaintiff submitted a note from her doctor, which stated that plaintiff's asthma had been made worse by her current environment and recommended relocation in order to relieve her symptoms. (Def. 56.1 P 29; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 29.) A letter from Stephanie Grant, whose letterhead identifies her as an "EEO Officer/Director," attempted to follow up with the plaintiff's request, and stated, among other things, that "[i]t is my understanding that your program has offered to relocate you to a different office in an attempt to accommodate you," but that if the plaintiff wished for further action, such as purchase of medical equipment, she would need to supply additional doctor's notes explaining the need for further action. 1 (Def. 56-1 P 31; Fay Dec. Ex. S.) Plaintiff testified at deposition that the new office offered to her was as dirty and unhealthy as her then-assigned office. (Def. 56.30 Kan. 82, 1 P 32; Fay Dec. Ex. B. at 108-09.) According to the Complaint, the defendant's conduct amounts to "unlawful employment practices and unlawful discrimination in violation of the ADA." (Compl.  [*7] P 28.)
3. The Plaintiff's Claims of Retaliation.
On March 26, 2007, the plaintiff received her performance review for 2006, and was rated "unsatisfactory." (Def. 56.1 P 37; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 37; Fay Dec. Ex. C.) The review noted unacceptable timeframes for handling referrals and insufficient progress in responding to older items. (Def. 56.1 P 38; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 38; Fay Dec. Ex. C.) The review also discussed plaintiff's difficulties in managing Fouks. It stated that the plaintiff had insufficiently documented her concerns about Fouks, and that disputes between the two "were often allowed to spill over onto staff," becoming a distraction from program-wide goals. (Def. 56.1 PP 40-41; Pl. 56.1 Resp. PP 40-41.) The review concluded that the plaintiff had not exhibited leadership, and recommended plaintiff's termination. (Def. 56.1 PP 42-43; Pl. 56.1 Resp. 1142-43.) Plaintiff was terminated from employment on April 6, 2007. (Def. 56.1 P 44; Pl. 56.1  [*8] Resp. P 44.) She commenced this action on or about March 26, 2008. (Def. 56.1 P 46; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 46.)
As the plaintiff points out, her negative review of March 26, 2007 followed the filing of a charge of discrimination with the New York State Division of Human Rights (the "Human Rights Division") on or about November 6, 2006, in which she alleged that she had been discriminated against on the basis of race and disability. (Def. 56.1 P 35; Pl. 56.1 Resp. PP 35-37.) The discrimination charge asserted that she had been required to work longer hours due to Fouks's inability to fulfill his duties, and that her asthma was exacerbated by the poor condition of her work area. (Def. 56.30  P 36; Pl. 56.1 Resp. P 36; Wade Dec. Ex. 8 at 2.)
In the Final Investigation Report and Basis of Determination (the "Final Report"), dated September 11, 2007, Regional Director Leon Dimaya concluded that an investigation by the Human Rights Division had "uncovered evidence supporting an inference of discrimination sufficient to require a public hearing." (Wade Dec. Ex. 12 at 3.) It noted that most of the e-mails involving plaintiff's work performance involved the plaintiff's displeasure with "one of  [*9] her subordinates" -- presumably Fouks -- and that "[t]here is very little documentation of alleged work performance problems of complainant until after she filed a complaint with the Division of Human Rights on Nov. 6, 2006." (Wade Dec. Ex. 12 at 3.) "The record suggests a causal nexus between respondent's treatment of complainant and her having filed a prior discrimination complaint with the Division of Human Rights." (Wade Dec. Ex. 12 at 3-4.)
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued the plaintiff a right-to-sue letter on December 27, 2007. (Fay Dec. Ex. W.) After issuance of the Final Report and the EEOC's right to sue letter, Administrative Law Judge Thomas S. Protano dismissed plaintiff's then-pending administrative complaint on grounds of administrative convenience, noting that the plaintiff intended to pursue her claims in federal court rather than administratively. (Fay Dec. Ex. V.)
SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment "should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Rule 56(c)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P.  [*10] It is the initial burden of a movant on a summary judgment motion to come forward with evidence on each material element of his claim or defense, demonstrating that he or she is entitled to relief. A fact is material if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law . . . ." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. The evidence on each material element must be sufficient to entitle the movant to relief in its favor as a matter of law. Vt. Teddy Bear Co. v. 1-800 Beargram Co., 373 F.3d 241, 244 (2d Cir. 2004).
When the moving party has met this initial burden and has asserted facts to demonstrate that the non-moving party's claim cannot be sustained, the opposing party must "set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial," and cannot rest "merely on allegations or denials" of the facts asserted by the movant. Rule 56(e)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P. In raising a triable issue of fact, the non-movant carries only "a limited burden of production," but nevertheless "must 'demonstrate more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,' and come forward with 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Powell v. Nat'l Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 364 F.3d 79, 84 (2d Cir. 2004)  [*11] (quoting Aslanidis v. U.S. Lines, Inc., 7 F.3d 1067, 1072 (2d Cir. 1993)).
An issue of fact is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. The Court must "view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor, and may grant summary judgment only when no reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of the nonmoving party." Allen v. Coughlin, 64 F.3d 77, 79 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotations and citations omitted); accord Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-88, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the court must scrutinize the record, and grant or deny summary judgment as the record warrants. Rule 56(c)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P. In the absence of any disputed material fact, summary judgment is appropriate. Id.
Mere "conclusory statements, conjecture, or speculation by the party resisting the motion will not defeat summary judgment." Kulak v. City of New York, 88 F.3d 63, 71 (2d Cir. 1996) (citing Matsushita, 475 U.S, at 587); see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50 (summary judgment may be granted  [*12] if the evidence is "merely colorable" or "not significantly probative") (citations omitted). An opposing party's facts "must be material and of a substantial nature, not fanciful, frivolous, gauzy, spurious, irrelevant, gossamer inferences, conjectural, speculative, nor merely suspicions." Contemporary Mission, Inc. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 648 F.2d 97, 107 n.14 (2d Cir. 1981) (quotation marks omitted).
DISCUSSION
I. The Relationship Between Plaintiff's Federal Claims and Her Claims Under the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL.
Plaintiff has asserted claims pursuant to four different statutes; Title VII, the ADA, the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL. Claims under the NYSHRL are construed pursuant to the same standards at its federal counterparts, including Title VII and the ADA. See Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 42 n.1 (2d Cir. 2000); Forrest v. Jewish Guild for the Blind, 3 N.Y.3d 295, 819 N.E.2d 998, 786 N.Y.S.2d 382 (2004) (relying on federal Title VII precedent to construe the NYSHRL). The NYCHRL is to be construed more liberally than the federal standards and the NYSHRL, which serve as the floors below which NYCHRL enforcement must not fall. See Williams v. New York City Housing Auth., 61 A.D.3d 62, 66-67, 872 N.Y.S.2d 27 (1st Dep't 2009) (NYCHRL  [*13] employs more liberal standard than the ADA in construing reasonable-accommodation disability claims); Phillips v. City of New York, 66 A.D.3d 170, 176, 884 N.Y.S.2d 369 (1st Dep't 2009) (discussing NYCHRL approach to reasonable-accommodation disability claims). Nevertheless, the NYCHRL does not alter "the kind, quality or nature of evidence that is necessary to support or defeat a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56," Winston v. Verizon Servs. Corp., 633 F. Supp. 2d 42, 49 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), and a plaintiff asserting an NYCHRL claim must still establish "by a preponderance of the evidence that she has been treated less well than other employees" due to protected status. Williams, 61 A.D.3d at 78.
II. Plaintiff Has Failed to Support a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination Based on Race.
The defendant moves for summary judgment in its favor, arguing that the plaintiff cannot come forth with evidence sufficient to support a prima facie case of discrimination as required under the first prong of McDonnell Douglas Corp, v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff first has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case  [*14] of discrimination. Id. at 802, To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must show (1) membership in a protected class, (2) qualification for the position, and (3) an adverse employment action arising under circumstances that (4) raise an inference of discrimination. Sassaman v. Gamache, 566 F.3d 307. 312 (2d Cir. 2009). The plaintiff's burden in establishing a prima facie case is "minimal" and "de minimis." Id. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its actions. Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). Finally, the plaintiff must then prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reasons proffered by the defendant were merely pretextual. Id.
Here, the defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination. It contends that no evidence supports plaintiff's claim to be qualified for her position, she did not suffer an adverse employment action and she cannot point to circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination. (Def. Mem. at 5-14.) In opposition to the defendant's motion, the plaintiff -- who  [*15] is represented by counsel, as she has been throughout this litigation -- fails to address in detail the elements of a prima facie case. Instead, she contends that Fouks's conduct subjected her to a hostile work environment. (Opp. Mem. at 3-9.)
In asserting a hostile work environment claim through her opposition to a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff fails to set forth evidence in support of her discrimination claim. First, plaintiff directs the Court to no evidence supporting the existence of a prima facie case, therefore failing to satisfy the first prong of McDonnell Douglas. Second, plaintiff asserts a claim that was not raised in her charge of discrimination, and it is therefore procedurally barred. Third, she attempts to amend her Complaint via a memorandum of law. I address each of these issues in turn.
A. Plaintiff Has Not Directed the Court to Evidence Supporting a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination.
In asserting a hostile environment claim, the plaintiff directs the Court to no evidence going to her qualifications, the existence of an adverse employment action or evidence giving rise to an inference of discrimination. Instead, her summary judgment opposition focuses  [*16] largely on Fouks's workplace conduct, including purported use of profanity, "derogatory comments about [plaintiff's] national origin," and plaintiffs unsuccessful efforts to terminate Fouks. (Opp. Mem. at 7-8.)
To the limited extent that the plaintiff addresses the existence of a prima facie case, she argues that she was qualified for her position and that her poor review arose only after she filed a complaint of discrimination with the Division of Human Rights. (Opp. Mem. at 8-9.) This argument is more appropriately directed in support of the retaliation claim. Moreover, as supporting evidence, the plaintiff cites only to the defendant's letter submissions to the Human Rights Administration, which were made in support of the lawfulness of defendant's conduct. (Wade Dec. Exs. 7, 9.) The letters do not go to plaintiff's qualifications, and instead merely set forth the defendant's past argument as to why its own conduct was lawful.
Similarly, the plaintiff's opposition papers do not identify an adverse employment action, and only assert, without citation to the record, that "she suffered an adverse employment action . . . ." (Opp. Mem. at 9.) The Complaint itself only vaguely alludes to  [*17] the plaintiff's ultimate termination. (See Compl. P 21.) Instead, it appears to allege that the plaintiff suffered an adverse action to the extent that she was not permitted to terminate Fouks, and to the extent that Olton eventually transferred Fouks without plaintiff's knowledge. (Compl. P 12.) Plaintiff's opposition memo does nothing to clarify the precise adverse action that she believes herself to have suffered, and, in any event, the transfer of Fouks without plaintiff's consent would not constitute an adverse employment action. See, e.g., Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., 584 F.3d 487, 499 (2d Cir. 2009) (an adverse employment action "include[s] termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices . . . unique to a particular situation.") (quotation marks omitted; ellipsis in original).
Finally, in arguing that the defendant's conduct supports an inference of discriminatory purpose, plaintiff cites only to "her supervisors['] ratification of Fouks'[s] racial behavior . . . ." (Opp. Mem. at 9.) Such conduct might have supported a prima  [*18] facie case if supported by the record, but the plaintiff loosely references statements by Fouks that amounted to "derogatory comments about [plaintiff's] national origin . . . ." (Opp. Mem. at 7.) In support, plaintiff cites to excerpts from her own deposition, in which she testified that Fouks "made comments based on where I am from. Not my color, as to where I am originally from." (Fay Dec. Ex. B. at 77.) Assuming that such remarks would be evidence of discrimination based on race as opposed to national origin, it is, standing alone, too vague and conclusory to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the defendant's actions were motivated by discrimination, and does not go toward any "ratification" of "racial behavior." (Opp. Mem. at 9.) Moreover, plaintiff's failure to direct the Court to any evidence of discrimination dooms her claim of race discrimination under the NYCHRL, just as it does under Title VII and the NYSHRL. See Williams, 61 A.D.3d at 78 (plaintiff asserting discrimination under the NYCHRL must prove at trial that he or she was treated less well than other employees on the basis of protected status).
Because plaintiff has failed to set forth evidence supporting a  [*19] prima facie case of discrimination based on race or disability, summary judgment is granted to the defendant.
B. Plaintiff Has Not Administratively Grieved a Hostile Work Environment Claim.
To bring a claim under Title VII, a plaintiff must first pursue administrative redress for claims that are "reasonably related" to plaintiff's Title VII claim. See, e.g., Deravin v. Kerik, 335 F.3d 195, 200 (2d Cir. 2003) ("As a precondition to filing a Title VII claim in federal court, a plaintiff must first pursue available administrative remedies and file a timely complaint with the EEOC"), "[P]recise pleading is not required for Title VII exhaustion purposes," however. Id. at 202. Claims not administratively grieved may be pursued "if they are reasonably related to those that were filed with the agency.'" Id. at 200 (quoting Legnani v. Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane, S.P.A., 274 F.3d 683, 686 (2d Cir. 2001)). "The exhaustion requirement is relaxed under the 'reasonably related' doctrine if, inter alia, 'the conduct complained of would fall within the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.'" Mathirampuzha v. Potter, 548 F.3d 70, 76 (2d Cir. 2008)  [*20] (quoting Terry v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 128, 151 (2d Cir. 2003)). The "reasonably related" doctrine may be invoked "when the factual allegations made in the administrative complaint can be fairly read to encompass the claims ultimately pleaded in a civil action or to have placed the employer on notice that such claims might be raised." Id at 77.
A grievance does not give adequate notice of a hostile work environment claim when it complains only of discrete acts of discrimination. In Mathirampuzha, the plaintiff's discrimination charge made no mention "repeated conduct or the cumulative effect of individual acts." Id. Instead, the plaintiff complained of one incident of physical and verbal abuse. Id. This was insufficient as a matter of law to exhaust a hostile environment claim that purported to allege long-term verbal harassment, denial of lunch breaks and refusal of assistance with work. Id.
As noted, plaintiff contends that summary judgment is improper because Fouks's conduct created a hostile work environment. (Opp. Mem. at 3-9.) But as in Mathirampuzha, the plaintiff in this case did not file a grievance that is reasonably related to a hostile work environment claim. Regarding Fouks's  [*21] workplace conduct, plaintiff's discrimination charge merely states: "From July to October, 2006, I have been working exceedingly long hours in order to meet the work schedule because Yosef Fouks, male, Caucasian, Israeli is unable to perform his duties. He sits and stares at the computer and produces no work." (Fay Dec. Ex. U at 1.) This assertion goes more toward an uneven distribution of workload based on Fouks's abilities than to the existence of a hostile environment. No other aspects of the charge go to a hostile environment claim.
Because the plaintiff did not administratively exhaust her hostile work environment claim, summary judgment is granted to the defendant.
C. The Plaintiff May Not Raise a Hostile Environment Claim for the First Time in Opposition to a Summary Judgment Motion.
Like the plaintiff's administrative grievance, the Complaint does not raise a hostile work environment claim. It asserts that "[d]uring a time after Foulk [sic] having made racist remarks mixed in with contemporary American profanity centering on a person having sexual relation with their mother, Plaintiff sought to severely reprimand if not terminate Foulk's employment. Rather than allowing plaintiff  [*22] to perform her duties, Olton transferred Foulk to another department without Plaintiff's knowledge in the dark of night." (Compl. P 12; emphasis in original.) Later, the Complaint asserts that "the defendant chose to terminate Plaintiff's employment because she dared to reprimand a white-male for unacceptable and hostile behavior in the workplace." (Compl. P 21.)
Although paragraph 21 uses the word "hostile," it cannot be construed to allege a hostile work environment, nor can any other allegation. As explained by National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 115, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002):
Hostile environment claims are different in kind from discrete acts. Their very nature involves repeated conduct. The unlawful employment practice therefore cannot be said to occur on any particular day. It occurs over a series of days or perhaps years and, in direct contrast to discrete acts, a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own. Such claims are based on the cumulative effect of individual acts.
(citations and internal quotations omitted). Generously construing the Complaint, it makes no assertion that could be read to allege that the plaintiff was subject to a hostile work environment,  [*23] and plaintiff's opposition memo is not the correct vehicle in which to initiate such a claim. "The opposition to a summary judgment motion is not an acceptable means by which [parties] may amend their pleading." Roswell Capital Partners LLC v. Alternative Constr. Techs.., 638 F. Supp. 2d 360, 368 (S.D.N.Y. 2009); accord Wright v. Ernst & Young LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 1998) (A "party may not amend [its] pleading through statements in [its] briefs."); Semple v. Eyeblaster, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76868, 2009 WL 2709281, at *3 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2009) ("Plaintiff cannot now seek to amend her pleading through arguments advanced in her opposition to summary judgment.").
Because the plaintiff's opposition to summary judgment consists of a theory of liability raised for the first time in her memorandum of law, summary judgment is granted to the defendant on plaintiff's claim of discrimination based on race.
III. The Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Retaliation Claims is Denied.
The defendant moves for summary judgment in its favor on plaintiff's claim that she suffered retaliation as a result of complaining that she suffered workplace discrimination. Retaliation claims under Title VII  [*24] are analyzed using a framework similar to the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting test. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show "(1) that she participated in a protected activity, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that there was a causal connection between her engaging in the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 2010 WL 569367, at *14 (2d Cir. 2010).
The defendant bases its motion for summary judgment principally on the contention that no evidence establishes a causal connection between the plaintiff's protected activity (in this case, filing a charge of discrimination with the New York State Division of Human Rights on November 6, 2006) and the negative employee reviews and termination that followed less than five months later. As held by Gorzynski, "'a plaintiff can indirectly establish a causal connection to support a discrimination or retaliation claim by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse employment action.'" Gorzynski, 596 F.3d at ___, 2010 WL 569367, at *15 (quoting Gorman-Bakos v. Cornell Coop. Extension of Schenectady County, 252 F.3d 545, 554 (2d Cir. 2001)).  [*25] According to the defendant, the five-month window between plaintiff's charge of discrimination and the plaintiff's termination in April 2007 is, as a matter of law, too lengthy to support an inference of causation.
Gorzynski rejected the precise argument asserted by the defendant, and held that a five-month window between the protected activity and act of retaliation was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a prima facie showing of causation. While the Second Circuit stated that it has refrained from drawing bright lines as to the temporal relationship between the protected activity and the adverse action, it also had "previously held that five months is not too long" to "find" causation. Id. This five-month period was sufficient in Gorzynski to make out a prima facie case on the causation prong, and warranted denial of summary judgment. Id. Here, the defendant's purely temporal argument for granting summary judgment is further weakened by the fact that the plaintiff's termination had a nexus to negative reviews that arose between the filing of her grievance and her termination. Thus, to the extent that the defendant relies on timing-related considerations, they are insufficient  [*26] to warrant summary judgment in its favor.
I have considered the defendant's other arguments and conclude that they do not set forth grounds sufficient to grant summary judgment. It is true that workplace tensions concerning plaintiff's relationship with Fouks predated the charge of discrimination, and that Olton first raised concerns about other facets of plaintiff s performance prior to the charge. But that does not necessarily render plaintiff's subsequent reviews and termination as solely originating in legitimate, non-retaliatory considerations. Moreover, while the defendant suggests that plaintiff's superiors did not know of her charge of discrimination, it proffers no affidavit or testimony asserting as much.
The defendant's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's retaliation claim is denied.
IV. The Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's ADA Claim is Granted.
In order to bring a successful ADA claim, a plaintiff first must make a prima face case that "'1) he [or she] was an individual who has a disability within the meaning of the statute; 2) the employer had notice of his [or her] disability; 3) he [or she] could perform the essential functions of the job  [*27] with reasonable accommodation; and 4) the employer refused to make such accommodation.'" DeRosa v. Nat'l Envelope Corp., 595 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 332 (2d Cir. 2000)). In moving for summary judgment, the defendant contends that it never refused an accommodation to the plaintiff, and that there is thus no evidence supporting the fourth prong of a prima facie case.
As noted above, the plaintiff submitted a written request for improvement in the air quality of her workspace. (Pl. 56.1 P 28; Def. 56.1 Resp. P 28.) She later submitted a note from her doctor, which recommended relocation in order to relieve her asthma symptoms. (Pl. 56.1 P 29; Def. 56.1 Resp. P 29.) Stephanie Grant, the relevant EEO officer, wrote back to the plaintiff, noting that she had been offered relocation and inviting further steps, including the purchase of medical equipment, if the plaintiff filed further supporting documentation. (Fay Dec. Ex. S.) While the plaintiff testified at deposition that her new office was dirty and unhealthy (Fay Dec. Ex. B at 108-09), there is no evidence that she followed up on Grant's solicitation of further assistance  [*28] if plaintiff provided adequate documentation. She testified at deposition that her doctor wrote no further notes and that she "didn't particularly explain[]" to the doctor her need for a separate note concerning an air filter. (Fay Dec. Ex. B at 112-13.) There likewise is no evidence that Grant's offer was made in bad faith.
"The ADA envisions an 'interactive process' by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated." Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000) (citing Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)). If an employer has made reasonable efforts to communicate with an employee, or if the employee causes "the interactive process to collapse," an employer will not be liable for failing to make an accommodation under the ADA. Williams v. British Airways, PLC, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73997, 2007 WL 2907426, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2007); accord Picinich v. United Parcel Serv., 321 F. Supp. 2d 485, 511 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) ("[W]here an employer makes reasonable efforts to communicate with an employee, liability under the ADA will not attach, and likewise, where  [*29] the employee causes the interactive process to collapse, the employer will not be liable."); Donofrio v. New York Times, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13788, 2001 WL 1663314, at *7 (S.D.N.Y, Aug. 24, 2001) (recommending grant of summary judgment to defendant due to evidence that the plaintiff stopped "working toward an accommodation of his disability . . . ."), R & R adopted, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2399, 2002 WL 230820 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2002); Economou v. Caldera, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18231, 2000 WL 1844773, at *24 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2000) (granting summary judgment to defendant because plaintiff "was responsible for a breakdown in the interactive process . . . ."). Similar to the ADA, the NYCHRL requires that "the first step in providing a reasonable accommodation is to engage in a good faith interactive process that assesses the needs of the disabled individual and the reasonableness of the accommodation requested." Phillips, 66 A.D.3d at 176.
Here, the defendant offered to accommodate the plaintiff, and merely requested additional documentation from the plaintiff before purchasing the requested air filter. Nothing in the record indicates follow-up action by the plaintiff. 2 Because the undisputed facts construed most favorably to the defendant demonstrate that the plaintiff  [*30] was responsible for the parties' breakdown in the interactive process, summary judgment is granted to the defendant.
CONCLUSION
Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted as to plaintiff's claims asserting discrimination based on race and disability. The motion is denied as to plaintiff's retaliation claims brought pursuant to Title VII, the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL.
SO ORDERED.
