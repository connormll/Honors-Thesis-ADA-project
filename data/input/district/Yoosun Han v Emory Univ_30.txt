ORDER
This case comes before the Court on Defendant Emory University's ("Defendant" or "Emory") Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 22].

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Yoosun Han ("Plaintiff") was a Manager of Research Projects in the Nephrology Division of the Emory University School of Medicine; beginning in September 2006, she reported to Dr. Arlene Chapman ("Chapman"), Professor of Medicine.1 Def.'s SUMF ¶ 1. Plaintiff was a salaried employee, exempt from overtime requirements, and was not permitted to take patient information outside of Emory's facility. Id. ¶¶ 5, 8. Many studies in which Plaintiff participated required that data be collected at specific hours during the day; relevant patient visits almost always occurred between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM. Id. ¶ 11.
In January 2013, Plaintiff's (unspecified) medical [*2]  condition grew more severe, causing her to miss several consecutive days of work. Id. ¶ 17. Plaintiff alleges she had difficulty coming to work in the mornings because of her chronic medical condition and needing time to take her medicine; she also states she had difficulty sleeping, leaving her tired. Id. ¶ 18. Plaintiff met with Jeanne Thigpen ("Thigpen"), Director of Human Resources, and informed her that she would need to be absent on occasion due to a medical condition, the nature of which she did not disclose. Id. ¶ 19. Thigpen explained to and discussed with Plaintiff various options, including Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") leave, Emory's sick-leave policy with modifications, or floating holidays and vacations. Id. ¶¶ 20-21. Because Plaintiff's doctor released her to return to work, and Plaintiff believed her illness was not serious enough to warrant FMLA leave, she believed the best solution would be floating holidays and vacation. Id. ¶ 22. On January 28, 2013, while absent, Plaintiff emailed Chapman that she would like to return to work in a week and would be using floating holidays and vacations for her absences related to Plaintiff's unspecified medical condition. [*3]  Id. ¶ 23.
Under Emory's Sick Leave Policy for Monthly Employees, an employee must use accrued sick leave when unable to perform job duties due to illness, or when a medical appointment cannot reasonably be scheduled during non-work hours; when an employee is unable to report for work, she must notify her supervisor as soon as possible, or no later than the beginning of the work schedule on the first day of absences, and on succeeding days. Id. ¶ 24. Sick leave is not calculated hourly, but is entered in either four- or eight-hour blocks. Id. ¶ 25. Thus, if an employee works more than four hours, she gets credit for an entire day of work. Id, If the employee works two hours, her sick leave balance will only be charged four hours. Id. ¶ 26. If the employee takes an entire day off, her balance will be charged eight hours. Id.
Emory's FMLA Policy allows eligible employees up to twelve weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a rolling twelve-month period for medical reasons. Id. ¶ 28. Employees may take FMLA leave intermittently (in brief blocks of time), provided they "try to schedule their leave so that it will not disrupt the department's operations." Id. (quoting Decl. of Marcus Urquiaga, [*4]  Ex. D [Doc. 22-3]). Employees on FMLA leave must use, during unpaid leave, any applicable paid leave in accordance with Emory's sick and vacation leave policies; in other words, FMLA leave and sick leave run concurrently. Id. ¶ 29. Plaintiff reviewed and was familiar with both leave policies during her leave. Id. ¶ 31.
In January 2013, Chapman believed Plamtitt to be ill at work, and advised her either to go to the employee health office or go home for the day; Plaintiff went home. Id. ¶ 32. Also in January, Marcus Urquiaga ("Urquiaga"), Administrator for Renal Division of the Department of Medicine, found Plaintiff at work after hours, and believed she was ill and weak; he advised her to go home for the evening. Id. ¶ 33.2 After these incidents, Chapman contended that it was unsafe for employees, including Plaintiff, to work after hours when the doors were locked. Id. ¶ 34. Regular office hours were clarified for all employees; they were not supposed to work significantly beyond 6:00 PM without permission. Id. ¶ 35.
On February 26, 2013, Plaintiff met with Urquiaga and HR representative Renee Hawes ( Hawes ), to discuss some scheduling needs that had arrsen due to Plaintiff's medical [*5]  condition. Id. ¶ 36. At this time, Plaintiff still had not requested FMLA leave, and had not indicated a need to do so. Id. Plaintiff requested flexibility in her working hours, and Emory offered her the options of 9:00 AM-4:00 PM (with salary reduction) or 8:00 AM-4:00 PM (with no salary reduction); Plaintiff chose the latter option. Id. ¶¶ 38-39.3
On March 22, 2013, Urquiaga and Hawes met again with Plaintiff to discuss her absenteeism and performance and to reiterate that her job required her to be present and reliable. Id. ¶ 41. They explained that Plaintiff's attendance was unreliable, that a fundamental requirement of her job was to be present and dependable, and that she must immediately improve in this area. Id. They reviewed Emory's leave policies and tried to convince Plaintiff to apply for FMLA leave, explaining that FMLA absences would be protected and she would not be subject to discipline. Id. Urquiaga and Hawes also explained that they wanted to give Plaintiff options and an opportunity to improve her performance but, if her current performance continued, it would lead to further discipline, up to and including termination. Id. ¶ 43.
Plaintiff refused to request FMLA leave, [*6]  stating that she did not want to disclose her medical condition. Id. ¶ 44. Urquiaga and Hawes tried to explain that information submitted for FMLA purposes would be confidential and protected by privacy laws, but Plaintiff believed Chapman would learn of her condition. Id, ¶ 45. Urquiaga and Hawes provided Plaintiff with written documentation of the meeting. Id. ¶ 48.
Eventually, Plaintiff understood she could apply for FMLA leave without disclosing the details of her medical condition. Id. ¶ 49. On or around April 30, 2013, Plaintiff requested intermittent leave under Emory's FMLA Policy and provided a physician s certification of the need for leave. Id, In the certification, Plaintiff s doctor indicated that Plaintiff could not lift more than three pounds, engage in continued physical activity, or be exposed to high temperatures for more than fifteen minutes. Id. ¶ 50. The doctor estimated that Plaintiff would need to attend late-afternoon doctors' appointments almost every week and that her condition would cause episodic (two-to-three-day) flare-ups approximately two to three times per month. Id. ¶ 51. The doctor recommended that Plaintiff take brief fifteen-minute breaks in the [*7]  morning and afternoon, and stated that "[t]elecommuting or flexible work hours are recommended, if possible, for her to be able to take the medications, especially in the morning, and eat some food[] every [two] hours." Id. ¶ 52 (quoting Tr. Of Dep. of Yoosun Han taken Mar. 4, 2015 ("Han Dep.") [Doc. 23-1] at 130 and Ex. 15).
Emory approved Plaintiffs request for FMLA leave. Id. ¶ 53. Consistent with its policies, Emory informed Plaintiff that she would be required to use paid leave concurrently with her FMLA leave until all her paid leave was exhausted. Id. In May 2013, Plaintiff only worked six full days at her schedule of 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM; all other days she was absent either a full or half day. Id. ¶ 55. In June 2013, Plaintiff only worked one full day at her set schedule; every other day she was absent for a half day or the entire day, or she had a doctor s appointment and arrived hours late to work. Id. ¶ 56.
On June 24, 2013, Plaintiff met with Urquiaga, Chapman, and a representative from HR to discuss several concerns. Id. ¶ 58. Chapman and Urquiaga agreed to follow up with HR on Plaintiff's request for an 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM schedule and to get back to her. Id. ¶ 60.4
Plaintiff [*8]  did not like reporting her FMLA hours worked and argued that it was sufficient to input her sick leave in Emory's sick leave reporting system. Id. ¶ 61. During the June 24 meeting and on several other occasions, it was explained to Plaintiff that the online sick leave reporting system was not capable of tracking her FMLA leave properly because it only tracked sick leave m blocks of either four or eight hours and gave credit for a full day's work as long as an employee worked more than four hours in a day. Id. ¶ 62. Pursuant to Emory's FMLA leave policy, the exact number of hours taken must be tracked for FMLA leave. Id. ¶ 63.
On June 28, 2013, Plaintiff had a follow up meeting with Urquiaga, Thigpen, and Hawes; during the meeting, Plaintiff was notified that her request was approved to work a flexible schedule between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM to allow her the flexibility to arrive late or leave early and still work forty hours per week. Id. ¶ 66. Any further schedule modifications would require Plaintiff to engage in the accommodations process through Emory's Office of Disability Services; they encouraged Plaintiff to contact that office to discuss any farther necessary accommodations.  [*9] Id. ¶ 67. Plaintiff refused because she did not want to disclose her medical condition. Id. ¶ 68.
Plaintiff also complained that she should not have to call in each day that she was going to be absent, late, or leave early. Id. ¶ 70. She believed Emory already knew that she was going to be late most days, so she should not have to call each time. Id. However, Emory required that Plaintiff must notify Chapman and Urquiaga if she was unable to come to work or was going to leave early. Id. ¶ 71.
The day after the meeting, Plaintiff emailed Urquiaga and Thigpen: "I still feel that clock in & out is the retaliation. It seems Jeanne [Thigpen] and I nave different interpretations of FMLA guideline[s]." Id. ¶ 72 (quoting Han Dep. at 187-88 and Ex. 22). Plaintiff sent another email the next day, repeating her claims that she should not have to track her FMLA hours. Id. Thigpen replied: You are being asked to track FMLA hours used each day not to clock in or out" and there should be no need for additional email messages. Id. ¶ 73 (quoting Han Dep. at 187 and Ex. 22). On July 2, Plaintiff was provided with a written memorandum reflecting the items discussed during the June 28 meeting; she initially [*10]  signed the memorandum, but later returned to Urquiaga s desk and ripped it up because she "did not agree" with it. Id. ¶ 74 (quoting Han Dep. at 182 and Ex. 20).
In July 2013, Plaintiff was absent for all but four days and exhausted her remaining paid leave. Id. ¶ 75. Thus, her FMLA leave was to be unpaid until she accrued additional paid sick leave or vacation (in August). Id. To give Plaintiff some work, Chapman temporarily assigned her duties related to data entry and other administrative tasks. Id. ¶ 77.
On or around July 24, 2013, Plaintiff met with Gloria Weaver ("Weaver"), the Director of Emory's Office of Access, Disability Services and Resources to discuss the possibility of requesting an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Id. ¶ 78. Weaver explained that Plaintiff potentially could receive a schedule accommodation but would need to provide specifics of her diagnosis for Emory to evaluate such a request. Id. ¶ 79. Plaintiff told Weaver that she did not want to engage in the ADA accommodation process because she refused to disclose her medical condition. Id. ¶ 80.
On July 24, 2013, Plaintiff made a complaint with Emory's Office of Equal Opportunity [*11]  Programs ("EOP") that she felt Chapman was violating Emory's policy against discriminatory harassment. Id. ¶ 81. The EOP conducted an investigation into the evidence but found no information suggesting that Chapman was violating Emory's discriminatory harassment policy. Id. ¶ 82.
In mid-August 2013, having exhausted her paid leave, Plaintiff stopped providing Emory with the hours she worked for FMLA tracking purposes because she did not want a salary deduction. Id. ¶ 83. Despite Emory's clear and repeated instructions, Plaintiff believed it was unfair and that she should not have her salary reduced. Id. ¶ 84; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SUMF ¶ 84.
On August 29, 2013, Chapman provided Plaintiff with a letter addressing several issues with her FMLA leave, including her refusal to report her FMLA hours. Def.'s SUMF ¶ 85. Chapman noted that Plaintiff had been advised of her obligation to call in each day that she would arrive late, yet continued to disregard this requirement. Id. Chapman explained that "[a]lthough you are required to notify us only once of the need for intermittent FMLA leave and you have done so, you are still required to comply with Emory's general call-in procedures with respect [*12]  to each individual absence. Id. ¶ 86 (quoting Han Dep. at 213-14 and Ex. 27). Chapman informed Plaintiff that she must report the hours that she works so that Emory could accurately determine the amount of time she was using for FMLA leave and that, for safety and security reasons, all employees in the office were expected to leave by 6:00 PM. Id. ¶ 87. Chapman again encouraged Plaintiff to work with the Office of Access and Disability Resources to participate in the accommodations process if she needed a more significant schedule modification and advised Plaintiff that Emory provides reasonable accommodations to individuals with a disability with appropriate documentation. Id. ¶ 88. Chapman also noted that the frequency of Plaintiff's FMLA-related absences far exceeded the expected frequency of flare-ups predicted by Plaintiff's doctor. Id. ¶ 89. Thus, Chapman requested that Plaintiff submit a recertification for FMLA leave from her health care provider. Id. Plaintiff's written response stated that she had missed more days than originally indicated due to a car accident and because her schedule was causing her health to worsen. Id. ¶ 90. She agreed to submit an additional FMLA medical [*13]  certification. Id.
Plaintiff also refused to comply with Chapman's instructions to report her time worked for FMLA tracking purposes. Id. ¶ 92. She claimed again that it was sufficient to submit her time through Emory's paid leave tracking system, although it had been explained to her repeatedly that the paid leave system does not track each hour worked as required by the FMLA. Id. Despite the fact that Plaintiff wanted to change her work schedule to avoid set work hours and to work whenever she felt able (mostly in the afternoons and at night), Plaintiff refused to participate in the ADA accommodation process. Id. ¶ 93. Plaintiff stated please stop inappropriate instructions and comments. I could have spent more time in working instead of meeting and writing this letter .... No matter what you do, I will do the right thing and I will choose the best that I believe. . . . Id. ¶ 94 (quoting Han Dep. Ex. 27). Despite Chapman's letter, Plaintiff did not begin reporting her late arrivals, nor did she report her hours worked for FMLA leave tracking. Id. ¶ 95.
On September 16, 2013, Plaintiff received a written warning for failing to follow Emory's policies and procedures and failing to follow [*14]  standards for reporting absences. Id. ¶ 96. The letter noted that, since the August 29 letter, Plaintiff still had not provided her hours worked for FMLA tracking purposes, despite receiving a reminder email. Id. ¶ 97. Plaintiff was warned that "[f]ailure to comply with these numerous requests is considered insubordinate behavior," that [t]here must be decided improvement in your performance," and that "further incidents of this nature are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment." Id. ¶ 98 (quoting Han Dep. at 229 and Ex. 29). Plaintiff submitted another written response, again stating she was not violating policies, that it was sufficient for her to submit her leave via Emory's exempt leave system, and that she did not have to report her absences or late arrivals because she had already notified Emory of the need for intermittent FMLA leave. Id. ¶ 99. After receiving the written warning, Plaintiff did not submit her time worked, and did not report her absences and late arrivals. Id. ¶ 100.
On October 15, 2013, Plaintiff received a final written warning, stating that "you continue to disregard directives concerning departmental work hours, reporting [*15]  of FMLA absences, and communicating with your manager regarding your arrival and departure times." Id. ¶¶ 101-02 (quoting Han Dep. at 231-32 and Ex. 30). The letter further noted, "Despite giving you the flexibility of arriving to work by 10:00 am and leaving by 6:00 pm, you continue to work outside of these parameters," and "there must be immediate and sustained improvement in your performance, to avoid further disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment." Id. ¶ 103 (quoting Han Dep. at 232 and Ex. 30). Plaintiff again submitted a response challenging the accuracy of the final warning and repeating the same claims made in her past letters. Id. ¶ 104.
On October 24, 2013, Plaintiff was provided with a letter informing her that her employment was being terminated due to insubordinate behavior, refusal to follow instructions, and failure to comply with Emory's policies and procedures. Id. ¶ 106.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). A party seeking summary judgment has the burden of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, [*16]  and identifying those portions of the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions," and cannot be made by the district court in considering whether to grant summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); see also Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1282 (11th Cir. 1999).
If a movant meets its burden, the party opposing summary judgment must present evidence that shows there is a genuine issue of material fact or that the movant is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the evidence is viewed m the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, "and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn" in favor of that opposing party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255; see also Herzog v. Castle Rock Entm't, 193 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir. 1999). A fact is "material" only if it can affect the outcome of the lawsuit under the governing legal principles. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. A factual dispute is genuine if the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Id.
"If the record presents factual issues, the court must not decide them; it must deny the motion and proceed [*17]  to trial." Herzog, 193 F.3d at 1246. But, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party," summary judgment for the moving party is proper. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587.

III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff contends that Emory violated the FMLA by failing to accommodate her request to change her work schedule from a regular, daytime schedule to a completely flexible schedule in which Plaintiff chose which hours she worked, usually at night. Compl. ¶ 10. Plaintiff also argues that Emory violated the FMLA by: (1) deducting more hours of FMLA leave than she actually took; (2) sending her home when she was able to work; (3) refusing to allow Plaintiff to work past 6:00 pm; (4) deducting from her pay; (5) requiring her to "clock in and out" of work; (6) requiring her to submit summaries of the work tasks she completed; and (7) terminating her employment. Id. ¶¶ 13, 20, 28.
The FMLA provides that an eligible employee shall be entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period . . . [b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). "To protect the availability of these rights, the FMLA prohibits [*18]  employers from interfering with, restraining, or denying 'the exercise of or the attempt to exercise' any rights guaranteed under the Act." McCarroll v. Somerby of Mobile, LLC, 595 F. App'x 897, 900 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1)).
The Eleventh Circuit has recognized two types of claims under the FMLA. First, the FMLA "protects employees against interference with the exercise or attempted exercise of their substantive rights under the statute." Surtain v. Hamlin Terrace Found., 789 F.3d 1239, 1247 (11th Cir. 2015). In order to state a claim for interference, the employee must allege that she was "entitled to a benefit under the FMLA and was denied that benefit." Id. Second, an employee may assert a claim for retaliation under the FMLA, which is an allegation that the "employer discriminated against [the employee] because [s]he engaged in an activity protected by the [FMLA]." Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Cmtys., Inc., 666 F.3d 1269, 1272 (11th Cir. 2012). To establish retaliation, an employee has the "increased burden" of demonstrating that her employer intentionally discriminated against her for exercising a right guaranteed under the FMLA. Martin v. Brevard Cty. Pub. Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267-68 (11th Cir. 2008).

A. FMLA Interference
Plaintiff contends that Emory interfered with her FMLA rights by (1) reducing her pay in an amount greater than justified by the amount of FMLA leave she took, (2) requiring her to work certain hours in a way that discouraged her from taking all the [*19]  FMLA leave she needed, (3) harassing her regarding the work she completed even though Defendant was already aware of the status of her work, and (4) terminating her employment while she was on intermittent FMLA leave. Pl.'s Resp. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. [Doc. 29] ("Pl.'s Resp.") at 10.

1. Work Schedule
Plaintiff s complaints regarding her work schedule are based on the theory that the FMLA requires accommodation. However, [s]uch a claim for relief fundamentally misconstrues the purpose of the FMLA, which is merely to entitle employees to take reasonable medical leave for medical reasons.'" Henry v. Fulton Cty. Bd. or Educ., No. 1:05-CV-2008 TWT, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74062, 2006 WL 2927533, at 4 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 10, 2006), aff'd, 228 F. App'x 970 (11th Cir. 2007). There is nothing in the language of the FMLA that compels employers to provide broad based workplace accommodations to employees with serious medical conditions. The only type of accommodation it provides is medical leave." Id. 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74062 [WL] *4 (stating that employees do not have the right to reasonable accommodations under the FMLA, but may under the ADA).
Numerous courts, including the Eleventh Circuit, have held that, unlike the ADA, there is no accommodation requirement under the FMLA. Gilliard v. Ga. Dep't of Corr., 500 Fed. Appx. 860, 2012 WL 6115913, at 2 (11th Cir. 2012) ("The leave provisions [*20]  of the FMLA are 'wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations of employers covered under the ADA ") (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 825.702(a)); Battle v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 438 F.3d 856, 864-65 (8th Cir. 2006); Brown v. Montgomery Surgical Ctr., No. 2:12-CV-553-WKW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38179, 2013 WL 1163427, at *5 (M.D. Ala. Mar. 20, 2013); Monroe v. Sisters of Saint Francis Health Servs., Inc., No. 2:09-CV-411, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95878, 2012 WL 2849455, at *8 (N.D. Ind. July 11, 2012) ("the FMLA does not require accommodations for disabilities" and "is strictly limited to providing leave in the event of a serious injury").5
Plaintiff argues Defendant required her to work between 8 AM and 4 PM, and Defendant denied her request to extend her hours to 6 PM and "be returned to her previous flexible schedule." Pl.'s Resp. at 12. Thus, according to Plaintiff, she "disregarded her physician's directive to begin work later in the day" and took less FLMA leave than she otherwise would have taken. Id. Defendant states Plaintiff's assertion is false, noting that Plaintiff has admitted she was subject to the 6 PM closing time but allowed to leave at 4 PM for doctor s appointments; then, she was allowed a flexible 8 AM to 6 PM schedule beginning in June 2013. Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SUMF ¶¶ 35, 59. In either case, Plaintiff fails to articulate how her hours interfered [*21]  with her taking FLMA leave.
Defendant provided all the leave that Plaintiff requested. Defendant's requirement that employees end the day when the clinic and administrative wing locked down for the evening was consistent with legitimate safety concerns and requirements of the job of a research coordinator. The FMLA does not require Defendant to create a nighttime schedule for Plaintiff. See Gilliard, 500 Fed. Appx. 860, 2012 WL 6115913, [WL] *2; Brown, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38179, 2013 WL 1163427, [WL] *5.6

2. Alleged Improper Deductions
There is no evidence in the record to support Plaintiff's allegation that Defendant "deducted more hours of FMLA leave than she actually took." See Decl. of PL Yoosun Han [Doc. 29-1] ¶ 3. Defendant's evidence, as opposed to Plaintiff's conclusory statement, shows Plaintiff's leave time was tracked by Plaintiff's reports, and never deducted for any amount greater than that which she reported. Decl. of Marcus Urquiaga [Doc. 22-3] ¶¶ 6-7, Ex. B. Plaintiff received her full salary for two-and-a-half months even though she had exhausted her paid leave; moreover, her FMLA leave was supposed to be unpaid, because she intentionally refused to report the FMLA leave she took beginning in mid-August 2013 through her termination m late October 2013. Defendant paid Plaintiff her [*22]  full salary for that period even though she continued to take FMLA leave, and contends, "This is above and beyond the twelve weeks of unpaid leave required under the FMLA. Henry, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74062, 2006 WL 2927533, at 3.
The Court agrees with Defendant. Although the Court draws all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of Plaintiff, her unsubstantiated declaration does not suffice to refute Defendant's evidence. See Brown v. Snow,440 F.3d 1259, 1266 (11th Cir. 2006).

3. Reporting Requirements
Plaintiff argues Chapman's requirement that she provide reports was superfluous, and that Chapman failed to articulate a reasonable basis for the distinction between her and an employee working a full-time schedule (though Chapman stated it was because she could observe the full-time employees' work more regularly). Pl.'s Resp. at 12-13. Plaintiff contends this constituted harassment and led her to take less FMLA leave than she otherwise would have done. Id. at 13.
The law, however, is clear that a "check-in requirement in and of itself does not violate the FMLA; in fact, the regulations expressly contemplate that employers may require employees to periodically report their status." Chauncet v. Life Cycle Eng'g, Inc., No. 2:12-CV- 968-DCN, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140579, 2013 WL 5468237, at 12 (D.S.C. Sept. 30, 2013); see also 29 C.F.R. § 825.311(a) ("An employer may require an employee on FMLA [*23]  leave to report periodically on the employee's status and intent to return to work."). Here, Plaintiff cannot show the updates and reports discouraged her from taking leave. Chauncey, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140579, 2013 WL 5468237, at 12 ("Requiring an employee on leave to provide reports is consistent with the FMLA regulations, and without more, does not give rise to a claim for interference..")

4. Termination
Plaintiff argues that her termination constituted interference because she still had FMLA leave available. Pl.'s Resp. at 13 (citing Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc., 259 F.3d 1112 (9th Cir. 2001); Henry, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74062, 2006 WL 2927533, [WL] *10). However, Plaintiff cites no law for the proposition that an employer may not terminate an employee while the employee still has FMLA leave remaining. Id. Ultimately, Plaintiff fails to provide any event or statement that pressured her to forego leave, or interfered with any leave, in any way whatsoever. Her self-serving statements cannot defeat summary judgment. See Brown, 440 F.3d at 1266.

B. FMLA Retaliation
A plaintiff who asserts a retaliation claim must prove that the employer acted with the intent to retaliate. Russell v. N. Broward Hosp., 346 F.3d 1335, 1340 (11th Cir. 200S). "A plaintiff may prove her case via direct evidence or circumstantial evidence." Cross v. Sw. Recreational Industries, Inc., 17 F. Supp. 2d 1362, 1371 (N.D. Ga. 1998). "Direct evidence is evidence that, if believed, proves the existence of a fact without inference or presumption." Morris v. Emory Clinic, Inc., 402 F.3d 1076, 1081 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation [*24]  marks and citation omitted). If the plaintiff lacks direct evidence of retaliatory intent, the Court analyzes the claim using the McDonnell Douglas framework applied to Title VII retaliation claims. Martin, 543 F.3d at 1268. To establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she engaged in a statutorily protected activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment decision, and (3) the decision was causally related to the protected activity. Id.
Here, Plaintiff certainly engaged in a statutorily protected activity (taking FMLA leave) and suffered an adverse employment action (being terminated).7 She alleges the existence of a causal connection due to temporal proximity and her allegation that the adverse acts are "indisputably related" to her leave. Pl.'s Resp. at 16. She argues Defendant's denial of evidence in the record regarding improper deductions in her pay is only a question of fact. Id. She states there is no legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for any of the acts.
The FMLA specifically provides that leave for eligible employees may be unpaid, even for partial days and even when the employee is a salaried employee exempt from overtime requirements. 29 U.S.C. § 2612 (c); 29 C.F.R. § 825.100 ("The [FMLA] allows [*25]  eligible employees of a covered employer to take job-protected, unpaid leave."); 29 C.F.R. § 825.207(a) ("Generally, FMLA leave is unpaid leave."); 29 C.F.R. 541.602(b)(7) ("[W]hen an exempt employee takes unpaid leave under the [FMLA], an employer may pay a proportionate part of the full salary for time actually worked.").
Plaintiff argues there is direct evidence that her termination occurred because she took FMLA leave and was thereby unable to work as Defendant required. PL's Resp. at 14-15 (citing Dep. of Arlene Chapman [Doc. 24-1] ("Chapman Dep.") at 59, 65, 123). However, the evidence establishes that Plaintiff was terminated because she refused to report the FMLA hours she took; refused to report her absences, or late and early arrivals to Chapman; and refused to adhere to her department's daytime schedule. Letter to Yoosun Han from Dr. Arlene Chapman, Pl. Dep. Ex. 31 [Doc. 23-5]; Chapman Dep. at 109, 122-23. Chapman stated in her deposition that it was not counted against Plaintiff that she was absent because of a medical condition. Chapman Dep. at 123.
[The] FMLA does not prohibit employers from terminating employees who do not comply with an internal company policy that requires employees to call-in when they will be [*26]  absent. The fact that the absence might be related to a FMLA qualifying event does not abrogate the right of employers to know whether their employees will be coming to work on a particular day.
Knox v. Cessna Aircraft Co., No. 4:05-CV-131 HL, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71528, 2007 WL 2874228, at *5 (M.D. Ga. Sept. 26, 2007). Further, an employer may require an employee to comply with the employer's "usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave." See Lewis v. Holsum of Fort Wavne, Inc., 278 F.3d 706, 710 (7th Cir. 2002) (holding that employee could be fired for failing to follow employer's customary call-in policy while taking FMLA leave).
Here, Emory has articulated a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for Plaintiff's termination; Plaintiff has admitted refusing to: (1) disclose the amount of FMLA leave she took, (2) follow Emory's procedures for reporting absences, and (S) maintain a daytime schedule, despite warnings from her supervisor. Plaintiff cannot establish that the reasons for her termination constitute pretext when she admits they occurred. See Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1333 (11th Cir. 1998). "Where the defendant's justification evidence completely overcomes any inference to be drawn from the evidence submitted by the plaintiff, the district court may properly acknowledge that fact and award summary judgment [*27]  to the employer." Young v. Gen. Foods Corp., 840 F.2d 825, 831 (11th Cir. 1988); Standard, 161 F.3d at 1333. Emory was entitled to rely on its policies which comply with the FMLA. Thus, the Court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact that preclude a finding that Emory did not retaliate under the FMLA.
