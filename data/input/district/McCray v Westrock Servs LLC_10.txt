Opinion



ORDER RE DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [67]
This matter is before the Court on the motion for partial summary judgment ("MSJ") brought by Defendant WestRock Services, LLC ("Westrock"). [Doc. # 67-1.] The motion is fully briefed. [Doc. ## 76 ("Opp."), 81 ("Reply").] The Court held a hearing on the motion on June 2, 2023. For the reasons set [*2]  forth below, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the MSJ.

I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Lowry McCray, an African American man and former employee of WestRock, filed this action on November 19, 2021 in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. Ntc. of Removal at 1-2 [Doc. # 1.]1 His Complaint asserts various state law claims relating to alleged discrimination and wage-and-hour violations which occurred during his employment at WestRock. Ntc. of Removal, Ex. 1 (Complaint) at 6 [Doc. # 1-1].2
WestRock now moves for partial summary judgment on each of McCray's claims under the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), California Government Code section 12900 et seq., for: Disability Discrimination (Claim 1); Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process and Provide Accommodations (Claims 2-3); Retaliation (Claims 4, 7) and Race Discrimination and Harassment (Claims 5, 8). See Ntc. of MSJ at 1 [Doc. # 67]. McCray initially alleged an additional FEHA claim for age discrimination, but the Court dismissed it based on the parties' stipulation on May 12, 2023. [Doc. # 79.]

II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND 3

A. Background
WestRock is a global manufacturer of paper and corrugated packaging, with more than 50,000 employees. SUF 1. WestRock formed in 2015, following [*3]  the merger of its parent companies, MeadWestvaco Corporation and Rock-Tenn Company. SUF 2. A portion of WestRock's business is dedicated to its Beverage Division, which serves beverage customers. SUF 3. WestRock ships its beverage inventory from its manufacturing plants to distribution center warehouses for storage and ultimate delivery to customers. See Def.'s Compendium of Evid., Ex. 2 (Decl. of Holly McGinnis ISO MSJ ("McGinnis Decl.")) ¶ 5 [Doc. # 67-2 ("Def.'s Compendium")]. WestRock maintains five domestic facilities that hold beverage inventory: three manufacturing facilities and two distribution/warehouse locations. SUF 5.

B. Move to La Mirada
In June 2017, WestRock's Beverage Division moved its California operations from its previous location in Chino to a 180,000 square foot warehouse in La Mirada. SUF 6. In La Mirada, WestRock's Beverage Division began sharing the warehouse with its Corrugates Division, and both divisions' operations began to be run by a third-party company, States Logistics ("States"). Id.
At first, two WestRock Beverage Division employees moved to the La Mirada warehouse: McCray, and his supervisor, Karl Gunther. SUF 7. McCray's title was Distribution Specialist [*4]  Coordinator ("DSC"). SUF 12. His duties as DSC included, but were not limited to, training the States personnel on inbound and outbound shipments, providing oversight on product defects, directing inventory counts, overseeing product recycling, and supporting warehouse processes. Id.
Three months after moving to La Mirada, Gunther's position was eliminated, making McCray the last and only WestRock Beverage Division employee at La Mirada. SUF 9, 10. At all relevant times, all other WestRock employees at La Mirada worked for the Corrugates Division, except Tad Collister, the warehouse's General Manager, who oversaw operations for both divisions operating there. SUF 11.
McCray's office was located on the west end of the La Mirada warehouse, but the other WestRock Corrugates employees worked in the design center, which had its own dedicated office space, on the east end of the warehouse. SUF 20-23, 25. The door to the corridor that led to the Corrugates Division "design center" offices was locked outside of business hours. Pl.'s Compendium of Evid., Ex. C (McGinnis Depo. Tr.) at 178-79 [Doc. # 76-4 ("Pl.'s Compendium")]; McGinnis Decl. ¶ 15. The Corrugates Division employees did not work [*5]  with McCray and their business roles did not overlap in any way. SUF 23. Only individuals with offices in the Corrugates design center were provided with a key to that area. SUF 25. McCray did not have a key to the design center corridor, which contained its own bathroom. SUF 24; Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. I (McCray Depo. Tr.) at 430.
After Gunther was terminated, McCray reported to Mario Parziale, the Beverage Division's Production Planning Manager. SUF 13. At that time, Parziale reported to Holly McGinnis, the Director of Supply Chain and Sales Support for WestRock's Beverage Division. SUF 14. Both Parziale and McGinnis are based in Richmond, Virginia, and supervised McCray remotely. SUF 15.

C. McCray's Issues at La Mirada
McCray's 2017 transition to the La Mirada warehouse brought some difficulties, which McCray attributes to a poor working relationship with Collister. See Decl. of Lowry McCray ISO Pl.'s Opp. ¶ 11 [Doc. # 76-2 ("McCray Decl.")]. McCray's desk did not arrive until nearly a month after moving to La Mirada, and he did not have printer access until at least August 2017. SUF 17, 18; AMF 19. There is no evidence that Collister was responsible for these inefficiencies. The key [*6]  that Collister gave McCray did not open the design center corridor, thus preventing him from using the design center restroom. SUF 24. McCray was upset about being forced to use the busier public restroom much of the time. SUF 24; AMF 15. His key only opened the back door to the warehouse, and outside business hours he could not walk through the front door (which led to the design center). AMF 15; Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. C (McGinnis Depo. Tr.) at 179; id., Ex. I (McCray Depo. Tr.) at 430. These disparities were acutely painful for McCray, because they "reminded [him] of the history in our country when" African American people like him were not allowed to use the same public facilities as white people. McCray Decl. ¶ 15. He alleges that Collister discriminated against him and "attempted to defame" him, "sabotage[] his work, and undermine[] his reputation." AMF 20.
On June 19, 2020, McCray received a call from a longstanding client about a late shipment of WestRock's beverage inventory. McCray Decl. ¶ 8. Upon investigating the circumstances of the late shipment, McCray learned that Collister had worked directly with States to resolve the problems with the shipment, even though it was the [*7]  type of issue McCray thought he would typically handle. Id. ¶¶ 8-9; SUF 31.4 McCray states he was "concerned because [he] believed that Collister was trying to intentionally sabotage [his] work performance and [his] relationship with the States employees" and that Collister "did not like [him] due to [his] race." See SUF 32; McCray Decl. ¶ 11. In emails sent between Parziale and McGinnis on July 1, 2020 about the incident, McGinnis acknowledged that "Lowry is again feeling disrespected by Tad" and "feels that Tad has a personal issue with him," and Parziale responded that "Tad specifically said not to tell Lowry" about the late load and acknowledged that "Tad trying to wedge between States and Lowry" was "a big red flag." Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 12 at 130-31.
McCray documented his complaints about Collister in an email to Parziale and McGinnis on June 25, 2020. SUF 30. Debbie Buchanan, the Human Resources Manager at that time, spoke to McCray about these concerns on July 28, 2020. SUF 35. After they spoke, Buchanan declined to investigate the matter further, although Parziale also spoke to McCray about the late shipment issue. SUF 36. Per McCray's recollection, in that conversation [*8]  he "told Mr. Parziale that I believed he was treating me unfairly because I am African-American." McCray Decl. ¶ 14. McGinnis and Parziale dispute knowing anything about alleged racial discrimination at that time. See McGinnis Decl. ¶ 22 (attesting to having no knowledge of McCray's perceived discrimination prior to June 1, 2021 email); Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 4 (Decl. of Parziale ISO MSJ ("Parziale Decl.")) ¶ 15 (same).
On July 1, 2020, McGinnis sent McCray an email explaining that WestRock's decision to switch trucking companies was motivated by an annual cost savings of over $50,000 for the beverage division. SUF 37; Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 14 (email from McGinnis to McCray dated July 1, 2020) at 137. Apparently, Collister was not involved in this decision, but after that incident Parziale and McGinnis determined that McCray should have been kept in the loop about the late shipment. SUF 39; Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 3 (excerpts from certified deposition transcript of McGinnis ("McGinnis Depo. Tr.")) at 53-55, 60.5 The decision to switch companies, however, was determined to be outside the scope of McCray's job. SUF 39, 40; Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 3 (McGinnis Depo. Tr.) at 55.

D. McCray's [*9]  Medical Leave
Starting in August 2020, McCray took a medical leave of absence. SUF 42. He provided Parziale and Buchanan a doctor's note each month. SUF 44. Sedgwick, a third-party leave administrator, was responsible for processing McCray's leave request and managing the medical certifications and records from his doctors during his leave. SUF 45. Parziale, McGinnis, and Buchanan did not have access to those documents or any medical records in his file. SUF 47.
McCray exhausted his FMLA leave on November 23, 2020, although WestRock continued to approve his requests for leave. SUF 48. He transitioned to Long Term Disability benefits in March 2021. SUF 49. WestRock did not fill his position during his leave of absence, and the majority of his tasks were performed by States employees or other existing WestRock employees. SUF 50. According to WestRock, McCray's responsibilities were successfully delegated during his leave to Geanie Barczak, a Warehouse Manager at a producing facility in Chicago. Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 19 (email from Buchanan to Justin Might and John Baker dated Apr. 26, 2021) at 173; Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. D (excerpts from certified deposition transcript of Parziale ("Parziale [*10]  Depo. Tr.")) at 47.

E. Elimination of McCray's Position
In January 2020, WestRock's beverage division first evaluated if States was able to operate without a WestRock employee at La Mirada. SUF 27. At that time, McGinnis decided not to eliminate the position. SUF 29.
On March 1, 2021, Buchanan again asked McGinnis whether there was a need to replace McCray or an ongoing need for an onsite WestRock beverage employee at La Mirada at all. SUF 51. In response, McGinnis emailed with Parziale about how the warehouse was operating, and Parziale expressed that States was performing well and that the warehouse could operate without the DSC position. SUF 52, 53. On April 26, 2021, McGinnis held a meeting to review staffing at La Mirada. SUF 54. According to WestRock, McGinnis and Parziale determined at that meeting that there was no longer a need for the DSC position at La Mirada and decided to eliminate it. SUF 58.
Buchanan was responsible for the administration of the layoff, and sent an email to her manager that night with the subject "Possible Job Elimination," informing him that McCray's job elimination "will be reviewed with Legal" and referencing "further discussions and planning." SUF 59, [*11]  60, 61, 62; see also Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 19 (emails re "Possible Job Elimination" dated April 26 and 29, 2021) at 172. She also followed up with McCray, asking if he had an update on a possible return to work. SUF 63. Rather than indicating an expected return date, McCray sent a note extending his leave to June 1, 2021. SUF 65. Since he did not have a definite return date yet, Buchanan did not discuss McCray's position elimination with him, nor did she submit the request for Legal to prepare the severance package. SUF 66; see also Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 8 (Decl. of Deborah Buchanan ISO MSJ ("Buchanan Decl.")) ¶ 15 ("Since [McCray] remained on approved leave of absence with no definite return to work date and had continued to extend his leave, I did not contact him to notify him his position was eliminated and did not immediately submit the request for legal to prepare the severance package. It was on my list of things to do.").
On May 30 or 31, 2021, McCray emailed Buchanan and Parziale a doctor's note specifying a return date of July 2, 2021, which also referenced "perceived adverse discrimination in the workplace." SUF 68, 69. This note caused McGinnis, Parziale, and Buchanan to [*12]  become aware, for the first time, that McCray's leave was related to perceived discrimination and that he was receiving mental health treatment for harassment. SUF 70. The note stated that he could return to work with the "accommodation" of having "non and/or limited interaction with [Collister] and to report only to Parziale." SUF 73. Buchanan did not evaluate the requested accommodation because, in her eyes, McCray's position had already been eliminated. SUF 76; see also Buchanan Decl. ¶ 18.
On June 3, 2021, Buchanan spoke to McCray and informed him that his position had been eliminated. SUF 78. She also asked him questions about his perceived discrimination. SUF 77, 79. On July 1, 2021, McCray sent an email asking Parziale to "point [him] to the next person I would talk to in regards [to] next steps/return to work." McCray Decl. ¶ 26; id., Ex. D at 18. On July 12, 2021, Buchanan sent McCray the severance package with a separation date of July 15, 2021. SUF 84, 85. WestRock has not reinstituted or filled McCray's position since its elimination. SUF 87.

III.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment should be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact [*13]  and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); accord Wash. Mut. Inc. v. United States, 636 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Nat'l Ass'n of Optometrists & Opticians v. Harris, 682 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248.
The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its initial burden, Rule 56(c) requires the nonmoving party to "go beyond the pleadings and by [his or] her own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e)); see also Norse v. City of Santa Cruz, 629 F.3d 966, 973 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) ("Rule 56 requires the parties to set out facts they will be able to prove at trial."). "In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). "Rather, it draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Id.

IV.

DISCUSSION
Under FEHA, "[i]t is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer, because of the race, . . . medical condition, . . . [or] age . . . to discriminate against [*14]  the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). In evaluating discrimination claims, California courts have adopted the three-part burden-shifting framework enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). Under this test, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Id. If the plaintiff does so, a rebuttable presumption of discrimination arises, which shifts the burden to the employer to show that the adverse employment action was taken for a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason." Id. at 355-56. Such reasons are those "that are facially unrelated to prohibited bias, and which, if true, would . . . preclude a finding of discrimination." Id. at 358. If the employer succeeds, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer's proffered reasons were pretext for a discriminatory motive. Id. at 356.
To be liable under the FEHA, the impermissible reason must have been at least a "substantial factor" in the employer's decision, even if not the only factor considered. Harris v. City of Santa Monica, 56 Cal. 4th 203, 232, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 294 P.3d 49 (2013). Because "discrimination claims are frequently difficult to prove without a full airing of the evidence and an opportunity to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses," McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1112 (9th Cir. 2004), "it should [*15]  not take much for a plaintiff in a discrimination case to overcome a summary judgment motion," France v. Johnson, 795 F.3d 1170, 1175 (9th Cir. 2015). When assessing a FEHA claim, courts may consider both circumstantial and direct evidence "from which a reasonable jury could reasonably conclude that the employee's disability actually motivated" the adverse employment action. See Hernandez v. Hughes Missile Sys. Co., 362 F.3d 564, 568 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90, 101-02, 123 S. Ct. 2148, 156 L. Ed. 2d 84 (2003)); see also DeJung v. Sup. Ct., 169 Cal. App. 4th 533, 549, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 99 (2008) ("In employment discrimination cases under FEHA, plaintiffs can prove their cases in either of two ways: by direct or circumstantial evidence.").

A. Disability Discrimination
WestRock seeks summary judgment on McCray's disability discrimination claim on the basis that McCray cannot show that WestRock's alternative reasons for discharging him were untrue or pretextual.6 See MSJ at 15-18; Opp. at 18-22; Reply at 5-15.

1. Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reason
WestRock's stated reason for eliminating McCray's position is that "there was not enough work to support the role" and "the few remaining responsibilities of the position were being effectively covered by States and existing WestRock employees at other facilities." MSJ at 16. By law, reduction-in-force can be a "legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for termination." See Holtzclaw v. Certainteed Corp., 795 F. Supp. 2d 996, 1012 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (citing Winarto v. Toshiba Am., 274 F.3d 1276, 1295 (9th Cir. 2001) (Wardlaw, [*16]  J. concurring)); Martin v. Lockheed Missiles, 29 Cal. App. 4th 1718, 1732, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181 (1994)). Westrock has submitted sufficient evidence of its "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" to eliminate the DSC position at La Mirada to meet its burden on McDonnell Douglas' second prong.
First, the record reflects that WestRock management had already considered eliminating all Beverage Division positions at La Mirada starting in 2017, when it first moved to the new warehouse. See SUF 8; McGinnis Decl. ¶ 9. In fact, McCray's supervisor's position was eliminated soon after the move to La Mirada, in furtherance of this goal. SUF 9; McGinnis Decl. ¶ 9; Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. C (McGinnis Depo. Tr.) at 173. At that time, McCray was kept on to oversee WestRock's processes in La Mirada, and specifically to train States in their new role there. See Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. D (Parziale Depo. Tr.) at 201.
Next, the record reflects that Buchanan inquired about possible elimination of McCray's job in January 2020, months before McCray went on leave, noting in an email that "I thought eventually, we were not going to continue with a [Westrock] employee on site" at La Mirada. Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 10 (email from Buchanan to McGinnis dated Jan. 31, 2020) at 126. At that time, McGinnis stated that she [*17]  thought McCray was adding value to La Mirada, even though "the warehousing team felt it was not necessary to have him there," but noted some concerns about "quality oversight." Id. In that email, she indicated she would check in with Parziale and Collister about the value of McCray's position. Id.; see also Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. A (McGinnis Depo. Tr.) at 19.
While McCray was on leave, WestRock "gave States a new point of contact for" the quality control work that he did, which appears to have gone smoothly. Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. C (McGinnis Depo. Tr.) at 47. Parziale testified that "there were some minor hiccups" but "no significant issues" during that time. Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. D (Parziale Depo. Tr.) at 215-18.
In March 2021, when McCray had exhausted his FMLA and Short-Term Disability benefits and was applying to transition to Long-Term Disability Benefits, Buchanan reached out to Parziale about whether to hire a replacement for McCray, and raised questions about the ongoing need for the role. SUF 51; Buchanan Decl. ¶¶ 10-11. In response to this inquiry, Parziale spoke to various stakeholders within different departments of WestRock and the La Mirada warehouse about McCray's position, [*18]  including, but not limited to, Collister. Parziale Decl. ¶ 12. After these conversations, Parziale concluded that "[o]verall I think we can expect La Mirada to continue operating smoothly if we don't replace Lowry." Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 18 (email from Parziale to McGinnis and Buchanan dated Mar. 11, 2021) at 168.
McGinnis and Parziale held a meeting on April 26, 2021, to discuss staffing and support for La Mirada. SUF 54. At that meeting, based on Parziale's findings and their own observations about La Mirada's operations, they finally decided to eliminate McCray's position. SUF 58.
Overall, the Court concludes that WestRock has provided sufficient evidence of its legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating McCray.

2. Pretext
Since WestRock satisfied its burden to show a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for eliminating McCray's position, the burden shifts back to McCray to show that the employer's proffered reasons were pretext for a discriminatory motive that played a "substantial" role in the decision. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 354; Harris, 56 Cal. 4th at 232; see also Opp. at 15-16. McCray does not have any direct evidence of discriminatory motive or pretext in the decision to eliminate the DCS position at La Mirada. [*19]  He does present, however, circumstantial evidence that creates a triable issue of fact as to whether his disability was also a "substantial motivating factor" in their decision. See id. at 356; see also Desert Palace, 539 U.S. at 100-01 (noting that circumstantial evidence is of particular importance in discrimination cases due to difficulty in obtaining direct evidence).
An employer "has treated an employee differently 'because of' a disability when the disability is a substantial motivating reason for the employer's decision to subject the employee to an adverse employment action." Zamora v. Security Industry Specialists, Inc., 71 Cal. App. 5th 1, 49, 285 Cal. Rptr. 3d 809 (2021) (citation omitted). Here, the parties do not agree on when the decision to eliminate McCray's position was "final." See Buchanan Decl. ¶ 12 (citing April 26, 2021); McCray Decl. ¶ 21 (citing June 3, 2021); see also Reply at 13-14. Construing all facts and inferences in favor of McCray, it was not final until he was notified on June 3, 2021, just days after he informed WestRock of his specific disability.7
This scenario has strong parallels to the facts of Lin v. Kaiser, a recent FEHA case in which the court denied summary judgment on a similar disability discrimination claim. 88 Cal. App. 5th 712, 829-30 (2023). In Lin, the court concluded that the record supported an inference that [*20]  disability discrimination became a motivating factor in the employer's decision to terminate Lin, even when she had previously been on a potential layoff list. Id. In doing so, the court considered that Lin's termination had not been final until Kaiser took the step of informing her of the termination, which occurred after it became aware of her disability. Id.
WestRock attempts to distinguish Lin v. Kaiser, but its material facts align closely with the evidence in this case. See Opp. at 17-18; Reply at 7. While McGinnis, Parziale, and Buchanan had previously discussed eliminating the position for years, the decision was only made "final," i.e., communicated to McCray, just a few days after they became aware of his specific disability. SUF 68, 78. Indeed, Buchanan's email to her manager on the same day of the meeting had the subject line "Possible Job Elimination," and referenced "further discussions and planning" that would need to occur before the decision was final. SUF 59-62; see also Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 19 (emails re "Possible Job Elimination" dated April 26 and 29, 2021) at 172. The temporal proximity between WestRock's knowledge of McCray's disability and his termination on [*21]  June 3 is "highly probative" of discriminatory intent. See Stegall v. Citadel Broadcasting Co., 350 F.3d 1061, 1069 (9th Cir. 2003). Based on this evidence, a juror could make a reasonable determination that McCray's disability became a "substantial factor" in WestRock's decision after he became disabled, just like the plaintiff in Lin.
WestRock argues that it did not have a policy of placing employees in other available positions upon elimination of their current position and it had no obligation to do so in McCray's case. MSJ at 18-19, 21-22. The past practices of its parent company, however, are inconsistent with that statement.8 See SUF 67; Buchanan Decl. ¶ 15; McCray Decl. ¶ 29. To the extent Buchanan and McCray's testimony contradicts each other on this point, courts "must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, including questions of credibility and of the weight to be accorded particular evidence" on summary judgment. Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 330 F.3d 1110, 1132 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 501 U.S. 496, 520, 111 S. Ct. 2419, 115 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1991)). McCray submitted evidence of available positions at WestRock, which he was qualified to perform, that existed at the time of his termination. See McCray Decl. ¶ 28. Under these circumstances, a reasonable juror could conclude that WestRock's failure to speak to this 27-year employee about other [*22]  available positions is also evidence of discrimination. See Zamora, 71 Cal. App. 5th at 52.9
Lastly, WestRock argues that in so-called "reduction-in-force" cases such as this one, "there is no adverse inference to be drawn from an employee's discharge if his position and duties are completely eliminated." MSJ at 17 (citing Rose v. Wells Fargo & Co., 902 F.2d 1417, 1421 (9th Cir. 1990) (citations omitted)). This is another disputed question of fact—the degree to which McCray's former duties were eliminated versus delegated to other WestRock employees.10 See SUF 87. WestRock did not hire anyone to fill in for McCray's role during his entire leave, nor has it hired anyone since to work for the Beverage Division in La Mirada. SUF 50, 87; cf. Zamora, 71 Cal. App. 5th at 22.
But to defeat summary judgment on this claim, McCray does not need to show that he was replaced by another employee. Rather, he can show "through circumstantial, statistical, or direct evidence that the discharge occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of . . . discrimination," which can be proven by demonstrating "the employer had a continuing need" for his "skills and services" or that his "duties were still being performed" by other employees. Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271, 1281 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing Rose, 902 F.2d at 1421; Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 891 (9th Cir. 1994)). McCray received numerous positive performance [*23]  reviews throughout his employment at WestRock, which can also support a finding of pretext for the termination. See AMF 3-8 (describing positive performance reviews); Flait v. N. Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal. App. 4th 467, 479, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992).
In short, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to McCray, the Court concludes that a reasonable juror could find that WestRock's decision to terminate him was "substantially motivated," at least in part, by his disability.
WestRock's motion for summary judgment is therefore DENIED as to McCray's disability discrimination claim.

B. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process and Reasonable Accommodations
Under the FEHA, employers must "engage in the interactive process" to determine "effective reasonable accommodations" for an employee upon learning of the employee's disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n).
As a threshold matter, the Court rejects WestRock's arguments that McCray was not disabled as of his return-to-work date. WestRock conceded the prima facie case, which necessarily requires a concession that McCray was disabled for purposes of the FEHA. See Reply at 5 n.1; see also Green v. State of Cal., 42 Cal. 4th 254, 262-63, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007) (discussing who is a "qualified individual" with a disability under the FEHA); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355 (to establish prima facie case of discrimination under FEHA, plaintiff must [*24]  provide evidence of membership in protected class).
It is undisputed that WestRock did not engage in the interactive process with McCray or seek to reasonably accommodate his disability before terminating him. SUF 76; see also Buchanan Decl. ¶ 18 ("I did not evaluate the requested accommodation and did not engage in the interactive process because [McCray's] position had been eliminated in April 2021."). Assuming, arguendo, that it is proper to not engage in any interactive process after a position is eliminated for non-discriminatory reasons, whether McCray's termination was in fact non-discriminatory is a triable issue of fact in this case.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES summary judgment on Claims 2 and 3.

C. Retaliation
To establish a prima facie claim for retaliation under FEHA, a plaintiff must prove that he (1) "engaged in a protected activity," (2) was subjected to an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a "causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). Requesting an accommodation qualifies as a protected activity under FEHA. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(l)(4).
Since there is a dispute of material fact as to the causal link between McCray's protected activity and his termination, [*25]  the Court DENIES summary judgment on this claim. See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1064-65 (9th Cir. 2002) (on a retaliation claim, FEHA plaintiffs must show "by a preponderance of the evidence that engaging in the protected activity was one of the reasons for his firing and that but for such activity he would not have been fired") (internal brackets omitted) (quoting Ruggles v. Cal. Polytechnic State Univ., 797 F.2d 782, 785 (9th Cir. 1986)).

D. Racial Discrimination and Harassment

1. Discrimination (Disparate Treatment)
To state a prima facie case of racial discrimination under a theory of disparate treatment, McCray must show that he (1) was in a protected class; (2) was performing his job in a satisfactory manner; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) some other circumstance suggests a racially discriminatory motive. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355 (citations omitted); see also Ayala v. Frito Lay, Inc., 263 F. Supp. 3d 891, 905 (E.D. Cal. 2017); Lawler v. Montblanc N. Am., LLC, 704 F.3d 1235, 1242 (9th Cir. 2013). Only the final element is at issue in this case.
McCray's Opposition appears to only address WestRock's arguments on his harassment claim and does not discuss the race discrimination claim. See Opp. at 27-30. To the extent McCray alleges in his Complaint that WestRock terminated him due to racial animus against African American employees, that claim is unsupported by any evidence, and he appears to have abandoned it now. See Compl. ¶ 81; Reply [*26]  at 19.
Since WestRock has provided significant evidence of a non-discriminatory motive for McCray's termination, and McCray does not offer any evidence to the contrary, the Court GRANTS summary judgment to WestRock on McCray's race discrimination claim.

2. Harassment/Hostile Work Environment
To establish a claim for race harassment/hostile work environment based on racial discrimination, McCray must show: (1) that he was subjected to verbal or physical conduct because of his race; (2) that the conduct was unwelcome; and (3) that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the plaintiff's employment and create an abusive work environment. Pinder v. Empl. Dev. Dep't, 227 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1143 (E.D. Cal. 2017); Thompson v. City of Monrovia, 186 Cal. App. 4th 860, 876, 112 Cal. Rptr. 3d 377 (2010).
McCray's harassment claim is based on three issues: (1) his building key did not open the private restroom or the front door to the warehouse; (2) restriction of use of work resources (such as printers); and (3) the conflict he had with Collister over the late shipment. Compl. ¶¶ 79-80; Opp. at 27-30. There is no direct evidence of any overtly racialized comments by Collister. McCray, based solely on his own testimony at his deposition and his declaration submitted in Opposition to this MSJ, argues that these incidents [*27]  were caused by Collister's racial animus. Opp. at 28, 29.
WestRock, on the other hand, provides legitimate, non-discriminatory justifications for each issue and supporting evidence for each justification. As for the restroom, McGinnis testified at her deposition that the reason McCray's key did not open the door to the private restroom is that it was inside the design center, an area used solely by the Corrugates Division, which was locked outside of business hours. Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. C (McGinnis Depo. Tr.) at 178-79; McGinnis Decl. ¶ 15.11 According to McGinnis, "only individuals with offices in the design center were provided a key to those offices and they used the restrooms located near those offices." McGinnis Decl. ¶ 15. In McCray's deposition, he testified that he had used the private restroom on "more than five" occasions, when the door was already open. Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. I (McCray Depo. Tr.) at 429-30. He also testified that he was not prevented from using the front door when the building was open. Id. at 431.
It is undisputed that McCray was the only Beverage Division employee at La Mirada, and thus not similarly-situated to the Corrugates Division employees [*28]  who had a key to their own work space. He does not provide evidence of any of the other WestRock or States employees' race, nor any other examples of any individuals outside the Corrugates Division who had access to those facilities. He testified that he observed other WestRock employees who worked outside the design department utilize a key to the same door, but could not recall a specific name or incident. Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. I (McCray Depo. Tr.) at 431-33. He also testified that on one occasion, McCray felt that Collister was specifically trying to avoid telling him the location of a spare key that would open the design center, which was given to another employee "Francisco." Id. at 433-34. Other record evidence reflects that "Francisco" worked in the design center. Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. E (excerpts from certified deposition transcript of Buchanan ("Buchanan Depo. Tr.")) at 338-39. There is no other record evidence that would establish that any other employee at the facility had a key to the design center who did not work there.
As for the printer, it was a short-lived issue that impacted McCray and his then-supervisor, Gunther. SUF 18.12 Neither side offers admissible evidence of [*29]  Gunther's race nor explains whether he was treated differently than McCray, other than the fact that he was laid off just a few months after the move to La Mirada while McCray remained employed. SUF 9.13 Nor does McCray show that the incident with the late shipment was motivated by racial animus. After the incident occurred, WestRock's management confirmed that many of the decisions that McCray complained about being excluded from were outside his job description. See SUF 39, 40; Pl.'s Compendium, Ex. E (Buchanan Depo. Tr.) at 379; Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 3 (McGinnis Depo. Tr.) at 53-55, 60. Accordingly, Collister's conduct in coordinating with States about a late shipment is within the scope of his job performance and not a proper basis for a harassment claim. Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal. 4th 640, 645-46, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333 (1998); see also Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 12 (emails between Parziale and McGinnis re: La Mirada staffing) at 130-31.
Even drawing all inferences in favor of McCray, he has not met his burden of production of any evidence—beyond his own conclusory statements in his declaration—of any genuine dispute of fact about whether Collister's actions were based on racial animus. See Villiarimo, 281 F.3d at 1061 (granting summary judgment when only evidence is "uncorroborated" [*30]  testimony of party). McCray asserts that Collister's actions were "degrading and offensive to him as an African American," McCray Decl. ¶ 15, and the Court has no doubt, based on the evidence, that these experiences deeply impacted McCray. It is also clear that there was some degree of tension between Collister and McCray, but the record is devoid of evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find race discrimination. See Def.'s Compendium, Ex. 12 at 130-31.
Without any direct or circumstantial evidence that would undermine WestRock's account of the above-described incidents, let alone of racial animus by Collister, the Court GRANTS summary judgment to WestRock on McCray's race harassment/hostile work environment claim.

E. Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Wrongful Termination
McCray's claims for failure to prevent discrimination and wrongful termination are derivative of his other claims. See Glynn v. Sup. Ct., 42 Cal. App. 5th 47, 56, 254 Cal. Rptr. 3d 772 (2019); Featherstone v. S. Cal. Permanente Med. Grp., 10 Cal. App. 5th 1150, 1166, 217 Cal. Rptr. 3d 258 (2017). Accordingly, the Court DENIES summary judgment on these claims insofar as they relate to the disability discrimination and retaliation claims and GRANTS summary judgment on these claims to the extent they are derivative of McCray's allegations of race discrimination.

F. Punitive [*31]  Damages
Punitive damages are available where "proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a). Such actions must have been either perpetrated or ratified by an "officer, director, or managing agent" of the company. Id. at § 3294(b).
Construing the facts in the light most favorable to McCray, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that punitive damages are not available in this case. The California Supreme Court has instructed courts to determine whether a supervisory employee is a managing agent based on "the extent to which they exercise substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy." White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 563, 564, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999). There are triable issues of fact as to whether Buchanan, Baker, Might, McGinnis, and Parziale were "managing agents" under this test, since there is record evidence that each of these individuals managed others, exercised discretionary authority, and created corporate policy to some degree. See Opp. at 32-33. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to McCray, the Court concludes that this is a factual issue for the jury. See White, 21 Cal. 4th at 664.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES WestRock's MSJ as to the availability [*32]  of punitive damages.

V.

CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, the Court orders the following:
a. Summary judgment is DENIED as to McCray's claims for disability discrimination, failure to engage in the interactive process, and failure to provide reasonable accommodation; as well as the corresponding derivative claims for failure to prevent discrimination and wrongful termination relating to his disability discrimination claims.
b. Summary judgment is GRANTED on McCray's claims for race discrimination and racial harassment/hostile work environment, as well as the corresponding derivative claims for failure to prevent discrimination and wrongful termination relating to his race discrimination claim.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
