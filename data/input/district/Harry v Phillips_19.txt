Opinion



MEMORANDUM & ORDER
Plaintiff, Carlton Harry ("Harry"), brings this action against his former employer, Defendant, Phillips and Cohen Associates, Ltd ("PCA"), and alleges disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and the Persons with Disabilities Employment Protections Act ("PDEPA"), 19 Del.C. § 720, et seq. He also asserts interference and retaliation under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq. Presently pending before the Court are Harry's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, (Doc. 18), and PCA's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 19).

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The following facts taken from the record have not been genuinely disputed. Harry worked for PCA as a debt collector in its Wilmington, Delaware, office from July 7, 2008, until his termination on August 18, 2016. PCA's employee handbook includes a paragraph describing eligibility for family or medical leave and instructing employees [*2]  to contact human resources for more information. In addition, PCA includes several employment posters in the break room, which includes information about family or medical leave. PCA also maintains a progressive disciplinary policy, which advances through verbal warnings, written policy reminders, written warnings, and ultimately termination. The employee handbook further provides that some conduct, such as gross misconduct, warrants termination even on the first instance.
Throughout his employment, Harry repeatedly triggered some form of written discipline for infractions such as attendance or compliance with debt collection regulations. He was also a good collector who enjoyed some special privileges on account of his success.
In 2009, Harry took his first medical leave with PCA following a car accident. His leave initially extended from November 24, 2009, through November 29, 2009, followed by a reduced schedule of approximately four hours per day from November 30, 2009, until December 8, 2009. Harry took additional medical leave from December 9, 2009, until December 23, 2009. At that point, he was released by his physician to return to work without restriction.
In August 2015, Harry [*3]  was again involved in a car accident that prompted medical leave. PCA granted Harry a full 12 weeks of medical leave, from August 11, 2015, through October 27, 2015. Harry was released to return to work without restriction, however, on September 4, 2015. He returned to a full-time work schedule at that time. From October 2015 until April 2016, Harry apparently received periodic treatment for his back until approximately April 27, 2016, Harry again took medical leave to undergo emergency back surgery. PCA granted him another 12 weeks of medical leave. On June 1, 2016, Harry was released from treatment with no restrictions and returned to work full time on July 18, 2016.
On August 13, 2016, Harry was called into a meeting with co-general managers Nardo Moulton ("Moulton") and Bryan Carscadden ("Carscadden"), as well as a senior vice president, Matthew Saperstein ("Saperstein") to discuss negative comments Harry reportedly had made about PCA. Five days later, PCA terminated Harry.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
After filing a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on January 11, 2017, Harry commenced this action with the filing of a Complaint on June 23, 2017. [*4]  (Doc. 1). PCA filed its Answer on August 9, 2017. (Doc. 5). On August 16, 2018, Harry filed the instant Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, (Doc. 18), which has been fully briefed. (Docs. 18, 24, 30). PCA filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on August 17, 2018, (Doc. 19), which also has been fully briefed. (Docs. 20, 25, 29). Both motions are ripe for our review.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party establishes "that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute is "genuine" only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the non-moving party, and a fact is "material" only if it might affect the outcome of the action under the governing law. See Sovereign Bank v. BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc., 533 F.3d 162, 172 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A court should view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom, and should not evaluate credibility or weigh the evidence. See Guidotti v. Legal Helpers Debt Resolution, L.L.C., 716 F.3d 764, 772 (3d Cir. 2013) (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000)).
Initially, the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact, and upon satisfaction of that burden, the non-movant must go beyond [*5]  the pleadings, pointing to particular facts that evidence a genuine dispute for trial. See id. at 773 (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). In advancing their positions, the parties must support their factual assertions by citing to specific parts of the record or by "showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).
A court should not grant summary judgment when there is a disagreement about the facts or the proper inferences that a fact finder could draw from them. See Reedy v. Evanson, 615 F.3d 197, 210 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing Peterson v. Lehigh Valley Dist. Council, 676 F.2d 81, 84 (3d Cir. 1982)). Still, "the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment." Layshock ex rel. Layshock v. Hermitage Sch. Dist., 650 F.3d 205, 211 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48) (internal quotation marks omitted).

IV. DISCUSSION
PCA seeks summary judgment on all claims asserted by Harry in his Complaint. Harry, by contrast, only seeks summary judgment on his FMLA interference claim. For this reason, we will begin with the FMLA interference claim and then proceed to the remaining claims in the Complaint.

A. FMLA Interference Claim (Count IV)
Generally, the FMLA "provides, in relevant part, that eligible employees are entitled [*6]  to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period due to an employee's own serious health condition." Ross v. Gilhuly, 755 F.3d 185, 191 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)). "When an employee returns from FMLA leave, the employer must restore the employee to the same or equivalent position he held, with equivalent benefits and with conditions of employment comparable to those he had when he left." Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)).
To state a claim of interference under the FMLA, a plaintiff must show "(1) he or she was an eligible employee under the FMLA; (2) the defendant was an employer subject to the FMLA's requirements; (3) the plaintiff was entitled to FMLA leave; (4) the plaintiff gave notice to the defendant of his or her intention to take FMLA leave; and (5) the plaintiff was denied benefits to which he or she was entitled under the FMLA" Id. at 192 (quoting Johnson v. Cmty. Coll. of Allegheny Cnty., 566 F.Supp.2d 405, 446 (W.D.Pa. 2008)). "Under an interference claim, 'the employee need not show that he was treated differently than others[, and] the employer cannot justify its actions by establishing a legitimate business purpose for its decision.'" Id. (quoting Sommer v. The Vanguard Grp., 461 F.3d 397, 399 (3d Cir. 2006)). An interference claim, in short, "is not about discrimination." Id.
Harry argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on his interference claim because PCA prevented him from [*7]  structuring his medical leave by failing to comply with the general and individualized written notice requirements and by not identifying when Harry's allotted medical leave replenished. PCA contends that it granted every period of medical leave that Harry requested and even granted him an extra three-and-a-half weeks of leave beyond his entitlement. Furthermore, PCA argues that its break room contained employment posters that informed all employees of their rights under the FMLA. Notably, Harry does not argue that he was denied leave per se, but that he did not know he could take his leave intermittently to allow him to attend physical therapy sessions. Harry also does not dispute the presence of the break room posters, but notes that the employee handbook was deficient and that he did not receive the required individualized notice.
Federal regulations require covered employers to post "a notice explaining the [FMLA's] provisions and providing information concerning the procedures for filing complaints of violations of the Act with the Wage and Hour Division." 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(a)(1). In addition, if the employer has any FMLA-eligible employees, a notice must be included "in employee handbooks or other written [*8]  guidance to employees concerning employee benefits or leave rights, if such written materials exist, or by distributing a copy of the general notice to each new employee upon hiring." Id. at § 825.300(a)(3). Employers may satisfy this requirement by duplicating the Department of Labor's prototype notice "or may use another format so long as the information provided includes, at a minimum, all of the information contained in that notice." Id. at § 825.300(a)(4). The prototype notice explains, in relevant part, that "[a]n employee does not need to use leave in one block. When it is medically necessary or otherwise permitted, employees may take leave intermittently or on a reduced schedule." United States Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Employee Rights Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, WH1420 (April 2016), https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/fmlaen.pdf.
Failing to provide the requisite notice "may constitute an interference with, restraint, or denial of the exercise of an employee's FMLA rights." 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(e). However, the Third Circuit has held that, to recovery on such a theory, the plaintiff must show that "this failure to advise rendered him unable to exercise that right in a meaningful way, thereby causing injury." Hansler v. Lehigh Valley Hosp. Network, 798 F.3d 149, 157 (3d Cir. 2015) (quoting Conoshenti v. Public Service Electric & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 143 (3d Cir. 2004) [*9] ). Thus, Harry must not only show that PCA's notice was insufficient, but that he was harmed as a result.
As to the sufficiency of PCA's notices, we agree with Harry. The regulations make clear that an employer must do more than merely hang a poster in the breakroom. PCA was also obligated to include sufficient information in its employee handbook. Instead, PCA's handbook states: "Employees may be eligible for a leave under the FMLA under certain conditions. Initial eligibility qualifications call for the employee to have worked for the employer for at least twelve (12) months and for at least 1,250-hours [sic] during the last year. See Human Resources for additional information." (Doc. 25 at 11). PCA's handbook language fails to state that leave can be taken intermittently or even how much leave an eligible employee is entitled to take. Thus, we find that PCA's general notice does not comply with FMLA regulations.
Harry also contends that PCA failed to meet its obligation to provide individualized written notice and identify the 12-month entitlement period. FMLA regulations mandate that employers "notify the employee of the employee's eligibility to take FMLA leave" whenever "the employer [*10]  acquires knowledge that an employee's leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason." 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(b)(1). In connection with the eligibility notice, employers must also "provide written notice detailing the specific expectations and obligations of the employee and explaining any consequences of a failure to meet these obligations." Id. at § 825.300(c)(1). Such notice should include, where appropriate, the applicable 12-month period of entitlement, any requirements that the employee provide medical certification, substitution of paid leave for unpaid leave, and information about the continuation of benefits, including any premiums to pay. Id. § 825.300(c)(1)(i)-(vii). Harry argues that PCA's leave of absence form fails to meet these requirements, but we disagree. The form indicates that the FMLA entitlement period runs from "the last 12 months" and explains the period of leave, the number of weeks designated as FMLA leave time, benefits, premiums to continue paying, and information about obtaining a medical certification. (Doc. 25-3 at 38-42). Accordingly, we find that PCA's form sufficiently meets the individualized written notice requirements.
As noted earlier, to succeed on his interference claim, Harry also must show that PCA's noncompliant [*11]  general notice in the employee handbook rendered him unable to exercise his right in a "meaningful way." Based on the record, no reasonable juror would find that Harry believed he needed to use all 12 weeks of leave at one time, as he repeatedly used less than the full allotment. His leave in August 2015, for example, was approved through October 27, 2015, but he concedes that he returned to work with his doctor's blessing on September 4, 2015. (Doc. 25-3 at 39, 47; Harry Dep. at 169:4-7). Later, when Harry requested leave for his surgery in 2016, he noted that he had been on leave within the past 12 months and was again approved for FMLA leave from April 27, 2016, to June 30, 2016. (Doc. 25-6 at 57-58). Also, in 2009, Harry appeared to be on leave from November 24 to 29, 2009, returned to work on a reduced schedule from November 30 to December 8, 2009, and went out on leave again from December 9 to 23, 2009. (Doc. 20-1, Ex. 9). Thus, Harry's behavior itself indicates his understanding that he could divide his FMLA leave into smaller chunks of time.
We take caution to note, however, that while Harry seems to have understood that he could take FMLA leave in shorter periods of days, rather [*12]  than months, that does not necessarily mean he understood that he could use FMLA leave in even smaller amounts to accommodate physical therapy appointments. Even when Harry worked a reduced schedule, it is not clear to the Court whether he understood that was part of FMLA or could be part of it. His time sheet for that period shows that he used vacation and sick time to account for the hours he did not work. (Doc. 20-1, Ex. 9). Moreover, he repeatedly testified that PCA denied him a modified work schedule, stating that they did not employ "part time" collectors. (Harry Dep. 54:2-24; 58:15-22). He further testified that he informed his doctor that a reduced work schedule was "not an option" after his 2015 accident. (Harry Dep. 164:17-24). A reasonable juror, therefore, could conclude that Harry only thought his reduced schedule in 2009 was permissible because he had adequate vacation and sick time, and that an extended period of time on a reduced schedule would not be allowed. Similarly, a reasonable juror could determine that Harry did not understand that he could use small amounts of FMLA leave time to attend treatment appointments. We find, therefore, that a question of material [*13]  fact remains with respect to the FMLA interference claim, and summary judgment is inappropriate. Accordingly, we will deny Harry's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. We will also deny PCA's Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the FMLA interference claim.

B. Disability Discrimination Claims (Counts I and VI)
Harry alleges disability discrimination under both the ADA and the PDEPA. Because a disability discrimination claim under the PDEPA is evaluated using the same "legal standards and framework" as the ADA, our focus will be on the ADA claim. See Wilgus v. Bayhealth Med. Ctr., Inc., K17C-07-032 JJC, 2018 Del. Super. LEXIS 312, 2018 WL 3559258, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. July 23, 2018). ADA discrimination claims follow the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). A McDonnell Douglas analysis proceeds in three stages:
First, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. If the plaintiff succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant "to articulate some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection." [McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802]. Finally, should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff then must have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination. See [*14]  Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). While the burden of production may shift, "[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff." Id.
Shaner v. Synthes, 204 F.3d 494, 500-01 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting Jones v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 198 F.3d 403, 410 (3d Cir. 1999)) [alterations in the original].
To show a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, Harry must show "(1) he is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA; (2) he is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and (3) he has suffered an otherwise adverse employment decision as a result of discrimination." Williams v. Phila. Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 761 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 306 (3d Cir. 1999). PCA argues that Harry cannot show disability or a causal link between any purported disability and his termination. We will begin by considering whether Harry has shown disability.
"To satisfy the requirement of having a 'disability,' a plaintiff may demonstrate any one of: an actual mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such impairment, or that his employer regarded him as having a disability." Macfarlan v. Ivy Hill SNF, LLC, 675 F.3d 266, 274 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing Marinelli v. City of Erie, Pa., 216 F.3d 354, 359 (3d Cir. 2000)). ADA regulations counsel against imposing an exacting standard on what qualifies as a "major [*15]  life activity" or a "substantial impairment." Major life activities include sitting or walking or the operation of the musculoskeletal system. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(i)-(ii). Furthermore, "[t]he term 'substantially limits' shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage . . . 'Substantially limits' is not meant to be a demanding standard." Id. at § 1630.2(j)(1)(i). "An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting." Id. at § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii).
PCA argues that Harry cannot show actual disability or that he was regarded as being disabled. In particular, PCA notes that Harry's doctor released him to return to work without restriction. (Doc. 25, Ex. R). The doctor's note stands in contrast to a later physical therapy record which recommends that Harry complete three physical therapy sessions each week for six weeks. (Doc. 25, Ex. S).1 Although the physical therapy note describes Harry's limitations as "moderate," we find that a plan recommending 18 physical therapy sessions indicates substantial limitation for ADA purposes. Thus, we find that Harry has sufficiently shown actual disability.2 PCA further argues that Harry has [*16]  not shown that his termination was a result of discrimination. Harry argues that the proximity between the date of his firing and the date he returned from FMLA leave is "unduly suggestive." The date that Harry returned from leave, however, does not seem to be a proper measuring point for determining proximity in the context of discrimination (as opposed to retaliation for exercising his rights). It stands to reason that PCA did not learn of Harry's disability only upon his return from medical leave. If the April 2016 surgery and subsequent physical therapy was related to the August 2015 car accident, then PCA knew of the disability in August 2015, not, for the first time, in July 2016. In that time period, PCA had granted Harry two medical leaves of absence, including additional time off beyond the limits of his FMLA allotment. Thus, we are not persuaded by Harry's argument that the timing is unduly suggestive of discrimination.
The record offers other evidence, however, that gives rise to a plausible inference of discrimination. In his deposition, Harry stated that he had asked for time off to attend his physical therapy sessions, but that his manager, Elizabeth McClane ("McClane") [*17]  denied his request, stating, "you have to do what is best for you." (Harry Dep. 180:3-11). He also stated that Saperstein, during the meeting just prior to Harry's termination, asked Harry questions about the surgery and the condition of his back. (Id. at 216:1-6). Furthermore, the separation notice related to Harry's termination indicates he was fired for "no specific event." (Doc. 25, Ex. Q). Viewing this evidence most favorably to Harry, we can plausibly infer discrimination.
In response to Harry's prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to PCA to demonstrate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for Harry's termination. On this front, PCA is largely consistent. Every employee of PCA who was deposed said that Harry was terminated for his negative attitude about the company, particularly vulgar comments he made immediately following his meeting with management about his hostile attitude. (Carscadden Dep. 107:13-17; Sapperstein Dep. 42:16-20; McClane Dep. 111:16-112:5; Moulton Dep. 46:22-47:8; Curtis Vincent Dep. 57:9-16). PCA also produced an affidavit of Stephanie Findley, who reported to PCA management what Harry had said. (Doc. 20, Ex. 20). We find that PCA has sufficiently [*18]  stated a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for Harry's termination, and the burden again shifts to Harry to show pretext.
"To avoid summary judgment . . . after the employer has proffered a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for an adverse employment action, the plaintiff . . . must produce evidence which: (1) casts sufficient doubt upon each proffered reason so that a fact finder could reasonably conclude that each reason was fabrication, or (2) allows a fact finder to infer that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of action." Morrissey v. Luzerne County Community College, 117 F.App'x 809, 812 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759 (3d Cir. 1994)). "To discredit the employer's proffered reason, the plaintiff cannot merely show that 'the employer's decision was wrong or mistaken.'" Id. at 813 (quoting Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765). "Rather, the plaintiff must demonstrate 'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact finder could rationally find them unworthy of credence.'" Id. (citing Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765).
The record, as previously discussed, shows that at the time of his firing, Harry had recently come off medical leave and had asked at least once about needing time off to attend physical [*19]  therapy. He had a meeting with management, during which time they asked specific questions about his condition. Within days of the meeting, he was terminated. PCA employees stated that the reason for his termination was his conduct, but his separation notice states "no specific event," despite having an option to select "conduct" as the event leading to separation. When asked why the separation notice seemed to conflict with testimony, Moulton confusingly explained that "[t]he specific event was his behavior, but there's nothing specific within his general behavior." (Moulton Dep. 75:13-15). Curtis Vincent, the director of human resources for PCA at the time, stated that when Harry asked why he was being fired, he told Harry "that there was no specific event." (Vincent Dep. 50:5). He later testified that he viewed the firing as related to "just continual trouble-making over the course of a long period of time." (Id. at 51:18-19). However, again, his termination did not occur until he was in need of periodic treatment for his back injury, and Harry's conduct was never referenced on the separation notice or in the termination meeting. We find that a reasonable juror could determine that [*20]  Harry's purported misconduct was used as a pretext for discrimination. Thus, we find that summary judgment is not appropriate for the discrimination claims.

C. Failure to Accommodate Claims (Counts II and VII)
We turn now to Harry's claims that PCA failed to accommodate him under the ADA and the PDEPA.3 Failing to make reasonable accommodations can constitute an adverse employment action within the context of the ADA. See Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 306 (3d Cir. 1999). An employer is not required, however, to permit an accommodation that "would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the [employer]." Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)) (alteration in the original). Nevertheless, the employer must participate in an "interactive process with the [employee] in need of accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and the potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." Id. at 311 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)). Implicit in the term "interactive," of course, is that the process "involves both the employer and the [employee] with a disability." Id. (quoting 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App.§ 1630.9 at 359). To show that an employer failed to participate in the interactive process, once a request for an accommodation has been made, a [*21]  plaintiff must show "1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith." Id. at 319-20 (citing Mengine v. Runyon, 114 F.3d 415, 420 (3d Cir. 1997); Bultemeyer v. Fort Wayne Community Schools, 100 F.3d 1281, 1285 (7th Cir. 1996); Taylor v. Principal Financial Group, Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996)).
PCA first argues that Harry's failure-to-accommodate claim is barred because his EEOC charge was untimely. PCA further contends that Harry was not denied a reasonable accommodation because he was not refused leave, was not entitled to an accommodation because he is not disabled, and never requested part-time status. Finally, PCA asserts that creating a part-time position that would not otherwise exist is not a reasonable accommodation. We will begin with the threshold issue of whether Harry's claim is barred because his EEOC charge was untimely.
An individual claiming discrimination must file a charge with the EEOC within 180 days or, if the person initially files a charge with a state agency, within 300 days. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). Here, Harry filed his EEOC charge on January 11, 2017, (Doc. 20, Ex. 19), and described PCA's refusal to [*22]  grant him a modified work schedule after his 2015 accident. However, as PCA notes, even applying the longer 300-day period, the refusal to offer Harry an accommodation in September 2015 occurred earlier than what the EEOC charge could cover. Harry argues that PCA not only failed to accommodate him after his return from leave in September 2015, but also after his return from surgery in July 2016, when he claims he was denied time off from work to attend physical therapy sessions. Thus, if the date from which we calculate the time limitation is July 18, 2106, when Harry returned from his surgery leave, then even at the shorter 180-day time frame, the January 11, 2017, charge is timely. PCA suggests that both the EEOC charge and the Complaint associate the failure-to-accommodate claim only with the refusal of a part-time work schedule in September 2015. We disagree.
The EEOC charge clearly identifies a failure to accommodate and references both the August 2015 accident and the April 2016 surgery. The charge also notes that Harry needed to attend physical therapy sessions weekly, which would result in missed time at work. Furthermore, in his Complaint, Harry alleges that PCA failed to accommodate [*23]  him by refusing "a modified work schedule (medical leave of absence plus time off from work for physical therapy)." (Doc. 1, ¶ 38) (emphasis added). Although we agree that the particular 2015 refusal was untimely when the EEOC charge was filed, we find that the alleged refusal after Harry's surgery was fairly within the scope of the charge, which was timely. Moreover, the "parameters of the civil action in the district court are defined by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination. . . ." Mandel v. M & Q Packaging Corp., 706 F.3d 157, 163 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Ostapowicz v. Johnson Bronze Co., 541 F.2d 394, 398-99 (3d Cir. 1976)). Therefore, we find that any purported refusal to accommodate Harry after he returned from surgery was timely incorporated into the EEOC charge and fairly within the scope of this action.
We turn now to PCA's substantive arguments. First, we can dispose of PCA's argument that Harry was not entitled to a reasonable accommodation because he lacked a disability. As noted earlier, we find sufficient evidence to point to a disability. With respect to PCA's argument that Harry neither requested a modified schedule nor was denied leave as an accommodation, the answer is less clear. To reiterate, the only part of Harry's EEOC [*24]  charge that was timely filed was the alleged denial of accommodations after his 2016 surgery.
Harry's only support comes from his deposition, when he stated that he had "multiple conversation[s]" with McClane, his manager, after returning from surgery about "the fact that I had to go to therapy." (Harry Dep. 203:15-17). When asked if PCA had approved his going to therapy, he stated that "There is no official approval. Once again, you have to do what is best for you. . . ." (Id. at 203:20-22). When asked if PCA had denied him permission to attend therapy, he replied, "Not in those words. I mean, but you have to do what is best for you, so you make your decision." (Id. at 204:1-3). Finally, when pressed if he had ever asked for a modified schedule after returning from his surgery, he responded with a flat "No" and stated that he "worked the full schedule except for the doctor visits." (Id. at 205:1, 9-10). Thus, Harry's vague and seemingly contradictory testimony offers little suggestion that he requested an accommodation in the first place and even less support that a request was denied. This is further evidenced by McClane's deposition, in which she explained that she could not recall [*25]  Harry asking for time off for physical therapy, but that "[i]f he did, it would not have been an issue. . . . Especially if he — I don't know, if he was hurt." (McClane Dep. 59:23; 60:7-8). Based on the evidence, we find that Harry has not sufficiently demonstrated a prima facie case for failure to accommodate. Harry's contradictory and vague statements do not create even a reasonable inference that he requested an accommodation, which was denied. Therefore, with respect to the failure to accommodate claims, we will grant summary judgment.

D. Retaliation Claims (Counts III, V, & VIII)
Finally, we turn to the remaining counts in Harry's Complaint, which state claims of retaliation under the ADA, PDEPA, and FMLA. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show (1) that he engaged in a protected activity or availed himself of a protected right, (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that there is a causal link between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action. Williams v. Phila. Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 757 (3d Cir. 2004); Lichtenstein v. Univ. of Pitt. Med. Ctr., 691 F.3d 294, 302 (3d Cir. 2012). Retaliation claims follow the same McDonnel Douglas burden-shifting framework as discrimination claims. PCA argues that Harry cannot show a causal link and, even if he could, [*26]  cannot show that PCA's legitimate non-discriminatory reason is pretextual.
Harry argues that his termination one month after his return from medical leave creates an inference of retaliation. "When the 'temporal proximity' between the protected activity and adverse action is 'unduly suggestive,' this 'is sufficient standing alone to create an inference of causality and defeat summary judgment.'" Lichtenstein, 691 F.3d at 307 (quoting LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass'n, 503 F.3d 217, 232 (3d Cir. 2007)). However, "there is no bright line rule as to what constitutes unduly suggestive temporal proximity." Id. (quoting LeBoon, 503 F.3d at 233). Similar to our aforestated discussion of the discrimination claims, we find that the circumstances here create an inference of retaliation. Not only did PCA fire Harry one month after his return from medical leave, but mere days before his termination, Harry's meeting with management included specific discussion of his car accident and physical condition. Furthermore, despite PCA management's testimony that a very specific event precipitated Harry's termination — that is, his insubordination and conduct on the floor after meeting with management — the separation notice failed to identify conduct as a cause for the termination, and Vincent acknowledged in his deposition [*27]  that he told Harry the termination was not for any specific event. Thus, we find that Harry has sufficiently shown an inference of a causal link between his medical leave and his termination. Moreover, we find this evidence is also sufficient to show pretext. Therefore, we will deny PCA's Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to Harry's retaliation claims.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, we shall deny Harry's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. We shall grant PCA's Motion for Summary Judgment as to the failure to accommodate claims (Counts II and VII) but shall deny the Motion as to all other claims.
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:
1. Plaintiff Carlton Harry's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, (Doc. 18), is DENIED.
2. Defendant Phillips and Cohen Associates' Motion for Summary Judgment, (Doc. 19), is GRANTED as to Counts II and VII.
3. Defendant Phillips and Cohen Associates' Motion for Summary Judgment, (Doc. 19) is DENIED as to Counts I, III, IV, V, VI, and VIII.
