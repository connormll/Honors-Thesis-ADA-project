Opinion



ORDER
Michael E. Hegarty, United States Magistrate Judge.
This action arises out of the Plaintiff's former employment with Defendant, and his claims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation based on his race, color, and national origin, and a claim for Defendant's failure to accommodate the Plaintiff's disability.1 Defendant seeks summary judgment on all claims, arguing that Plaintiff failed to file this action in a timely manner and, in the alternative, Plaintiff fails to raise genuine issues of material fact as to each claim. Plaintiff counters that this action is, in fact, timely, and his unrebutted evidence demonstrates material factual issues for resolution by a jury. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the Defendant's motion.

FINDINGS OF FACT
The Court makes the following findings of fact viewed in the [*2]  light most favorable to Plaintiff, who is the non-moving party in this matter.2
1. Plaintiff Andre Hakizimana ("Hakizimana") was born in Rwanda and left in 1994 as a refugee. He traveled throughout Africa as a refugee from 1994-2008 before arriving in the United States on September 20, 2008.
2. On May 29, 2012, Defendant JBS USA, LLC ("JBS") hired Hakizimana in the "gutter" position.
3. Hakizimana worked on the second shift; he started work at 3:00 p.m. and typically ended at 11:30 p.m. Hakizimana and the other second shift employees were occasionally required to work longer or shorter hours based on JBS's operational needs.
4. JBS's handbook prohibits employees from abandoning their work stations. General infractions justifying disciplinary action include: "Refusal of any employee to carry out the request of management to perform work as directed; or neglect of duty such as loafing, wasting working time, being out of the work area without supervisor's permission, or sleeping on the job. Leaving the company premises before your work shift ends without getting permission from your supervisor or manager in charge of your work area."
5. When hired, Hakizimana acknowledged that he received JBS's [*3]  employee handbook, and he reviewed the handbook at orientation.
6. Hakizimana was familiar with JBS's policies and procedures prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.
7. Within three months of starting his employment, Hakizimana alleged that his co-worker Enrico Marceleno called him "nigger" and "fucking nigger," and Marceleno looked at him with an "angry face."
8. Marceleno was a gutter, the same position held by Hakizimana. Although Marceleno was the cousin of Joseph Marceleno, Hakizimana's acting supervisor, Hakizimana testified that Marceleno "was not my team leader, he was not my supervisor." Deposition of Andre Hakizimana, March 15, 2019 ("Hakizimana dep.") 29: 2-4, ECF 29-1.
9. At the time Marceleno was hired, he informed JBS that he had been convicted of a felony in 2009 for "Escape/Attempt to Escape from halfway house." In fact, Marceleno had been convicted of five felonies: 2006 (Burglary), 2007 (felony menacing with a real or simulated weapon), 2007 (Trespass-1-Auto with intent to commit a crime), 2007 (flight escape from halfway house), 2010 (flight escape from a halfway house).
10. Hakizimana contends that Marceleno never called him by his name, but called him [*4]  "nigger" almost every day.
11. Hakizimana complained to the union regarding Marceleno's conduct and the union referred him to JBS's Human Resources department.
12. Hakizimana reported Marceleno's conduct to Human Resources Manager Jason Miller, who advised Hakizimana to speak to his superintendent.
13. Hakizimana verbally complained to the superintendent that Marceleno was acting "angry to me."
14. Following this complaint, the superintendent called a meeting with all of the second shift gutters, including Hakizimana and Marceleno, to "talk about work"; at this meeting, the superintendent then took the opportunity to talk about "those issues" and "remind everybody of the company's policy."
15. Hakizimana did not have issues with any other co-workers, supervisors, or managers during his employment with JBS.
16. On August 17, 2012, Hakizimana suffered an injury while working at the gut table "cleaning" animals.
17. During his August 17 shift, Hakizimana cleaned a cow with an abscess. An abscess is an indication of a sick cow which may require that the gutter take precautions such as changing clothes and taking a shower to prevent cross contamination.
18. Hakizimana had to leave the line to take [*5]  a shower. This made Marceleno angry and he called Hakizimana a "nigger" at that time. Hakizimana dep. 35: 1-12 (". . . when I get off of the line, going and taking a shower, switch clothes, he said this word.").
19. Shortly after Plaintiff returned from his break, he was feeling pain, went off the line and sat down and discovered that he had been stabbed.
20. Hakizimana was cut on the back of his leg by Marceleno, between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., but Hakizimana did not see Marceleno cut him.
21. Immediately after the injury, Hakizimana was taken to the Health Services Department to receive medical treatment.
22. While in the Health Services Department, Hakizimana gave a statement regarding how the injury occurred, reporting that "[w]e were working at gutter table, the person who cut me, I was behind him working and after that he done his step of job and he fell [or pull] down sometime cutting me with his knife in his hands."
23. Marceleno also provided a statement to JBS, reporting that he "fell down into liver area as I proceeded back up knife was still in right hand reached over and sliced Andre in his left leg."
24. Pursuant to JBS's standard policy and procedure following a workplace [*6]  accident, Hakizimana was given a drug test. He never saw whether Marceleno was given a drug test.
25. JBS investigated the cause of Hakizimana's injury by taking statements from Hakizimana and Marceleno.
26. Jason Miller, Human Resources Manager, confirmed that there is surveillance footage in the work area and that, because he did not investigate the incident, he did not review it and did not know whether the incident was captured on video.
27. Trudy Sawyer, Health Services Manager, knew that there was surveillance footage in the work area and stated that she had reviewed it at times in connection with worker's compensation cases, but she did not recall viewing the incident involving Hakizimana.
28. JBS determined that the incident was an accident caused by Marceleno slipping and falling at the gut table.
29. JBS called an ambulance and, after he waited more than thirty minutes, Hakizimana was taken to North Colorado Medical Center in Greeley, Colorado.
30. The Emergency Room Report states, "[patient] was accidentally cut on L posterior thigh by a co-worker cutting meat.... [patient] says that a coworker tripped and fell and cut his leg with a knife."
31. On August 18, 2012, Hakizimana underwent [*7]  surgery to repair the cut on his leg.
32. After the surgery, Hakizimana's physician wrote a note stating, "Mr. Hakizimana needs off work until the following Monday ['9 days']. He may return to work in 5 days if he can do light duty and is able to rest his leg. He will need stitches out in 14 days." ECF 29-9.
33. On Monday, August 20, 2012, Hakizimana went to the JBS facility at 3:00 p.m. to provide information from the hospital that included his prescriptions and time off. He was on crutches, and JBS finally let him leave at 7:30 p.m. JBS required that Hakizimana report to JBS's Health Services Department that whole week.
34. Records from Hakizimana's August 21, 2012 medical examination revealed his "chief complaint" was a "L[eft] thigh laceration. At work while working cutting meat, cut open cow, the person in front of me fell he had a knife in his hand, when he fell he cut my L thigh."
35. Records from an August 23, 2012, medical examination revealed that Hakizimana complained that he felt uncomfortable having to drive to work while on pain medication.
36. Hakizimana's physician explained to him that "he needs to take the medication as soon as he wakes up in the morning[;] 6 hours later [*8]  he will be driving to work he can take another pill as soon as he gets to work and then not take another one until after he gets home following his eight-hour work shift."
37. Following his injury, Hakizimana could not perform the essential functions of his job as a gutter so, on August 23, 2012, JBS sent a letter to Hakizimana's treating physician, Dr. Catherine Smith, asking if Hakizimana had the physical capacity and ability to perform a light duty job in "Health Services Observation."
38. In the Health Services Observation position, "[a]ll tasks performed will allow for minimal walk/stand, he may use crutches with no weight bearing and he may sit or lie with the left leg elevated. He will not drive while on pain medications. He will not be required to lift, carry, push or pull. Will be sitting sedentary in health services for observation by medical staff and provided support by staff for any pain management."
39. According to Health Services Manager Trudy Sawyer, the position was to report to the Health Services Department and do nothing, "...they would literally just sit there."
40. Dr. Smith approved the light duty position on August 23, 2012, confirming that Hakizimana could perform [*9]  the job duties described.
41. The same day, Sawyer hand-delivered to Hakizimana a letter explaining the approved light duty position. Hakizimana accepted the position.
42. After Hakizimana's workplace injury, JBS filed a workers' compensation claim on his behalf. Hakizimana received workers' compensation benefits in an amount between $9,000 and $10,000.
43. Hakizimana believed Marceleno intentionally cut his leg. He "went to talk to the union, went to talk to the Human Resource, yeah, but the union didn't help, the Human Resource didn't help." 44. Marceleno was recently sentenced to five years in the department of corrections for a March 14, 2017 knife attack.
45. After Hakizimana's injury, he attempted to file a lawsuit against Marceleno for cutting his leg. According to Hakizimana, the court advised him that he must report the incident to the police prior to filing a lawsuit, which he had not yet done.
46. On September 11, 2012, Hakizimana went to the Greeley Police Department to report the alleged assault by Marceleno, because he believed Marceleno cut him on purpose, he was afraid something further might happen, and he wanted the police to investigate.
47. The Greeley Police conducted [*10]  an investigation, which consisted of interviewing Hakizimana and Marceleno, reviewing JBS's incident report, asking for any video of the incident (which JBS denied existed), and attempting without success to contact a purported eyewitness. The investigator suspended the investigation finding that JBS's incident report, which included the eyewitness' statement, was consistent with Marceleno's statement. ECF 29-15.
48. On Friday, November 23, 2012, Sawyer called Miller to report that two employees left the Health Services Department.
49. Hakizimana left the Health Services Department and went outside to stretch his leg, according to his physician's instruction. Sawyer had given Hakizimana permission to go anywhere he wanted in the plant, except the work area, to stretch his leg as required by his physician.
50. Miller went to investigate the report and encountered Hakizimana as he was returning to the Health Services Department.
51. Miller asked Hakizimana why he left the Health Services Department, to which Hakizimana explained that he had gone to his car to get his phone while stretching his leg. Hakizimana dep. 65: 4-11.
52. Hakizimana and Miller proceeded to the Health Services Department [*11]  to discuss JBS's policies regarding leaving the work station without prior permission from a supervisor. Miller states that he took Hakizimana's identification badge to write down the correct spelling of his name. Deposition of Jason Miller, June 11, 2019 ("Miller dep.") 52: 19-25, 53: 1-14, ECF 33-4.
53. Miller issued Hakizimana a "Final Warning" for violating JBS's policy prohibiting employees from leaving their workstations on an unscheduled break without receiving prior permission from a supervisor.
54. The Final Warning stated: "you are receiving a final warning for walking off the job in regards to leaving your work area without authorization for [sic] from management. You understand the proper procedures if you need to take an unscheduled break and you must inform management or management support employee when you are leaving for an unscheduled break. You admitted to this violation and did not inform any management or management support this will not be tolerated. Any further occurrences will result in further discipline up to and including termination."
55. Hakizimana had received no prior warnings.
56. Hakizimana disputed the disciplinary action, claiming that he was following [*12]  his doctor's order to stretch his leg.
57. Hakizimana left the meeting to discuss the written warning with his union representatives.
58. Hakizimana and a union representative then went back to the Health Services Department to further discuss the written warning with Miller.
59. After this meeting, Hakizimana went to his car and left JBS's premises. Hakizimana believed that, since Miller took his identification badge, he was terminated from employment.
60. Miller believed that Hakizimana left work without permission for the second time that day and determined to terminate Hakizimana's employment.
61. On Monday, November 26, 2012, Hakizimana returned to JBS to speak with a union representative and once again speak with Miller.
62. Miller informed Hakizimana and the union representative that JBS was terminating Hakizimana's employment, because he walked off the job on November 23 and abandoned his work station prior to the end of his shift.
63. Hakizimana admits that Miller did not make any discriminatory remarks or comments toward him prior to, during, or after the termination meeting.
64. On November 26, 2012, JBS implemented Hakizimana's termination.
65. Miller never made any racial or disability-related [*13]  comments toward Hakizimana prior to, during, or after he terminated Hakizimana.
66. Hakizimana has not identified any other employee who left JBS's premises without permission and was not terminated. He admitted, "No one left without permission, everybody stay in JBS premises."
67. On December 13, 2012, Hakizimana filled out an EEOC Intake Questionnaire in which he alleged a single claim of retaliation, based on Marceleno cutting his leg and Miller refusing to show him footage of the incident from a surveillance camera.
68. On January 29, 2013, Hakizimana filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Colorado Civil Rights Division and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). Expanding on his original Intake Questionnaire, this time he alleged discrimination based on race, national origin, retaliation, and disability.
69. On February 7, 2013, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights to Hakizimana. 70. Hakizimana claims he did not receive the Dismissal and Notice of Rights.
71. On March 12, 2013, Hakizimana went to the EEOC office to check on the status of his charge and requested that his case be reconsidered.
72. Hakizimana made his handwritten request for reconsideration [*14]  on a copy of an EEOC communication to him, in which the EEOC explicitly stated that Hakizimana's Charge of Discrimination was dismissed on February 7, 2013, and his only options were to "(a.) file a lawsuit in Federal District Court by May 8, 2013, or (b.) to submit your written request to Field Office Director Nancy Sienko for reconsideration of EEOC's dismissal." ECF 29-23.
73. Also on March 12, 2013, Hakizimana filled out another EEOC Intake Questionnaire, in which he alleged that he was discriminated against by JBS and Sedgwick American Insurance, the Workers Compensation Insurance Carrier. This time, Hakizimana alleged race, national origin, disability, and retaliation as the bases for discrimination.
74. On March 14, 2013, the EEOC sent a letter denying Hakizimana's request for reconsideration "because of the self-defeating nature of the information that was provided to [the EEOC]." The letter also described that "[t]he final dismissal notice which was issued described your right to pursue the matter in court by filing a lawsuit within 90 days of your receipt of the dismissal notice. This 90 day period for filing a private lawsuit cannot be waived, extended, or restored by the [*15]  EEOC."
75. On May 20, 2013, after a request from Hakizimana's attorney, the EEOC issued its first Notice of Intent to Reconsider. This letter stated that "[t]he Charging Party's right to sue is hereby vacated, unless the Charging Party has filed suit, the 90-day suit period has expired, or the Charging Party received a notice of right to sue pursuant to 29 CFR Section 1601.28(a)(1) or (2)."
76. On June 10, 2013, Hakizimana filed an amended Charge of Discrimination alleging discrimination on the bases of race, color, national origin, retaliation, and disability.
77. Nearly three years later, on April 18, 2016, the EEOC issued its second Dismissal and Notice of Rights letter to Hakizimana.
78. On June 8, 2016, the EEOC once again issued a Notice of Reconsideration to re-open the investigation into Hakizimana's Charge.
79. On April 27, 2018, two years after the second Dismissal and five years after the first Dismissal, the EEOC issued its third and final Dismissal and Right to Sue Letter.
80. Hakizimana filed his Complaint in this action on July 24, 2018.
81. Despite Miller's knowledge of the security camera in the work area for food safety purposes, the Greeley Police Department's request for the security footage in September [*16]  2012, Hakizimana's November 29, 2012 small claims complaint against JBS, Hakizimana's multiple EEOC Charges, and Hakizimana's request for the footage during this case, JBS failed to preserve this video evidence.

LEGAL STANDARDS
A motion for summary judgment serves the purpose of testing whether a trial is required. Heideman v. S. Salt Lake City, 348 F.3d 1182, 1185 (10th Cir. 2003). The Court shall grant summary judgment if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, or affidavits show there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing substantive law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). No genuine issue of material fact exists "unless the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Hasan v. AIG Prop. Cas. Co., 935 F.3d 1092, 1098 (10th Cir. 2019) (quoting Bones v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 366 F.3d 869, 875 (10th Cir. 2004)).
The moving party bears the initial responsibility of providing to the Court the factual basis for its motion. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "The moving party may carry its initial burden either by producing affirmative evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim, or by showing that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence [*17]  to carry its burden of persuasion at trial." Trainor v. Apollo Metal Specialties, Inc., 318 F.3d 976, 979 (10th Cir. 2002). Only admissible evidence may be considered when ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); World of Sleep, Inc. v. La—Z-Boy Chair Co., 756 F.2d 1467, 1474 (10th Cir. 1985).
The non-moving party has the burden of showing there are issues of material fact to be determined. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. That is, if the movant properly supports a motion for summary judgment, the opposing party may not rest on the allegations contained in his complaint, but must respond with specific facts showing a genuine factual issue for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007) ("[t]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.") (citation omitted); see also Hysten v. Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry., 296 F.3d 1177, 1180 (10th Cir. 2002). These specific facts may be shown "'by any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves.'" Pietrowski v. Town of Dibble, 134 F.3d 1006, 1008 (10th Cir. 1998) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324). "[T]he content of summary judgment evidence must be generally admissible and...if that evidence is presented in the form of an affidavit, the Rules of Civil Procedure specifically require a certain type of admissibility, i.e., the evidence must be based on personal knowledge." Bryant v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 432 F.3d 1114, 1122 (10th Cir. 2005); see also Hasan, 935 F.3d at 1098 (""Unsubstantiated [*18]  allegations carry no probative weight in summary judgment proceedings.").
"The court views the record and draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party." Pepsi—Cola Bottling Co. of Pittsburgh, Inc. v. Pepsico, Inc., 431 F.3d 1241, 1255 (10th Cir. 2005).

ANALYSIS
JBS argues that Hakizimana failed to file his claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act within the statutory time period. Alternatively, JBS contends that Hakizimana can demonstrate no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether JBS is liable for discrimination, harassment, or retaliation based on race or national origin, and for failure to accommodate Hakizimana's disability.

I. Plaintiff Raises a Material Factual Issue as to Whether His Claims Are Timely
According to JBS, because Hakizimana did not file an action within ninety days of the EEOC's notice of right to sue, dated February 7, 2013, the notice was not revoked despite the EEOC's notice of intent to reconsider issued on May 20, 2013.
Unless a plaintiff files suit within ninety days of receiving a right-to-sue notice from the EEOC, he or she is foreclosed from bringing suit on the allegations made in the EEOC Charge of Discrimination. Jackson v. City & Cty. of Denver, 628 F. Supp. 2d 1275, 1294 (D. Colo. 2008) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1); 29 U.S.C. § 626(e)). The ninety—day time [*19]  limit starts to run on the date the plaintiff receives the EEOC notice of right to sue. Id. (citing Jackson v. Continental Cargo—Denver, 183 F.3d 1186, 1189 (10th Cir. 1999)). The date on which a complainant actually receives a right-to-sue notice is a material fact. Witt v. Roadway Express, 136 F.3d 1424, 1429 (10th Cir. 1998).
It is undisputed here that Hakizimana sought reconsideration of the February 7, 2013 notice on March 12, 2013. ECF 33-7 at 4. Under such circumstances, the EEOC's regulations provide the following:
(1) In cases where the Commission decides to reconsider a dismissal or a determination finding reasonable cause to believe a charge is true, a notice of intent to reconsider will promptly issue. If such notice of intent to reconsider is issued within 90 days from receipt of a notice of right to sue and the charging party has not filed suit and did not receive a notice of right to sue pursuant to § 1601.28(a)(1) or (2), the notice of intent to reconsider will vacate the dismissal or letter of determination and revoke the notice of right to sue. If the 90 day period has expired, the charging party has filed suit, or the charging party had requested a notice of right to sue pursuant to § 1601.28(a)(1) or (2), the notice of intent to reconsider will vacate the dismissal or letter of determination, but will not [*20]  revoke the notice of right to sue.
29 C.F.R. § 1601.21(b). JBS contends that Hakizimana should have received notice three-to-five days after the EEOC mailed the notice and, thus, the latest date on which he was required to file an action was May 13, 2013. And, since the notice of intent to reconsider was issued on May 20, 2013, the February 7, 2013 notice was not revoked under the regulation. Hakizimana counters that he first received notice of his right to sue on March 12, 2013 when he visited the EEOC; as such, Hakizimana contends that the May 20, 2013 notice of intent to reconsider was issued within the ninety-day period and the February 7, 2013 notice of right to sue was revoked.. Therefore, whether Hakizimana timely filed this litigation depends on when he received notice of his right to sue from the EEOC.
Hakizimana contends that he never received the February 7, 2013 notice, which reflects an incomplete mailing address in that it omits his apartment number. ECF 29-22. He points to his original Intake Questionnaire, which contains his complete address, to show that he provided the EEOC his correct address. See ECF 29-20.
JBS counters that, although the notice reflects an address on which Hakizimana's [*21]  apartment number is omitted, "it must be presumed that the agency takes care to mail official notices to the current and complete address maintained in its file." Reply 14. JBS also cites to a 1992 opinion from the D.C. Circuit concerning the receipt of class notices by putative class members for the proposition that "it must be presumed that the USPS is routinely able to complete delivery to apartment dwellers even when the sender fails to specify the apartment number." Id.
The Court is not convinced and finds Hakizimana has raised a material factual issue as to whether and when he received the notice of right to sue. No party disputes that Hakizimana visited the EEOC on March 12, 2013 and, viewing the record in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the Court finds that Hakizimana's testimony that he first learned of the notice on March 12, 2013, together with the notice showing an incomplete address, is sufficient to present to a jury the issue of when Hakizimana actually received notice of his right to sue from the EEOC. See Witt, 136 F.3d at 1429 (plaintiff's affidavit stating when he received a notice of right to sue created a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment).
Accordingly, [*22]  the Court denies JBS's motion for summary judgment on the basis of timeliness.

II. Plaintiff Fails to Raise a Material Factual Issue as to His Discrimination Claim
To survive summary judgment on a Title VII claim of discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, a plaintiff must present either direct evidence of discrimination or, as here, indirect evidence that satisfies the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Bekkem v. Wilkie, 915 F.3d 1258, 1267 (10th Cir. 2019). Under this framework, a plaintiff must first "raise a genuine issue of material fact on each element of the prima facie case, as modified to relate to differing factual situations." Id. (citing Morgan v. Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d 1319, 1323 (10th Cir. 1997)). The burden then "shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision." Id. If the employer does so, "the burden then reverts to the plaintiff to show that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the employer's proffered reason for the challenged action is pretextual—i.e., unworthy of belief." Id.
JBS contends that Hakizimana has failed to raise material factual issues as to the elements of his prima facie case, but the parties agree that Hakizimana's race discrimination claim is based on his termination of employment. [*23]  A plaintiff may demonstrate a prima facie case of discriminatory termination by showing "(1) he was a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified and satisfactorily performing his job; and (3) he was terminated under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination." Drury v. BNSF Ry. Co., 657 F. App'x 785, 789 (10th Cir. 2016) (citing Salguero v. City of Clovis, 366 F.3d 1168, 1175 (10th Cir. 2004)). "One of the ways [the] third prong may be met ... is by attempting to show that the employer treated similarly situated employees differently." Gardenhire v. Manville, 722 F. App'x 835, 842 (10th Cir. 2018) (quoting Jones v. Denver Post Corp., 203 F.3d 748, 753 (10th Cir. 2000)).
JBS argues that Hakizimana fails to allege or present evidence demonstrating the third prong that he was terminated on the basis of his race, color, or national origin. According to JBS, the unrebutted record reflects Hakizimana's testimony that he had no problems with Miller, who terminated his employment. Hakizimana counters that the circumstances surrounding his complaints to Human Resources about Marceleno calling him a "n—er," Miller's refusal to address the issue and action in passing it off to Hakizimana's superintendent, Miller's failure to investigate thoroughly Marceleno's slashing of Hakizimana's leg, JBS's action in drug testing Hakizimana, but not Marceleno, JBS's failure to preserve video evidence of the slashing, and Miller's [*24]  termination decision suffice to demonstrate Hakizimana was terminated under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.
The Court agrees that Hakizimana fails to demonstrate issues of fact concerning the third prong of his prima facie case of discriminatory termination. While Hakizimana argues that he was treated differently than his Hispanic co-worker with respect to drug-testing, there is no indication that Miller had anything to do with that treatment. Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that Miller made any biased remarks or, otherwise, treated Hakizimana differently than similarly situated employees outside his protected class. Finally, while the facts may demonstrate that Miller failed or refused to meaningfully address Hakizimana's complaint about Marceleno calling him a "n—er" in August 2012, there is no indication that Hakizimana made further complaints to Miller about Marceleno and, thus, Miller's failure in early August 2012 (even if true) would be too remote from the November 23, 2012 termination decision to raise an inference that Miller terminated Hakizimana because of his race, color, or national origin. See Bideau v. Beachner Grain, Inc., No. 10-2390-JTM, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103406, 2011 WL 4048961, at *8 (D. Kan. Sept. 13, 2011) [*25]  (quoting Trujillo v. PacifiCorp., 524 F.3d 1149, 1157 (10th Cir. 2008)) ("Depending on the specific facts of the case, temporal proximity can contribute to an inference of discrimination."); see also Meiners v. Univ. of Kan., 359 F.3d 1222, 1231 (10th Cir.2004) (time period between two to three months not sufficient alone to establish causation in Title VII denial-of-tenure case).
For Hakizimana's failure to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was terminated under circumstances giving rise to an inference of race, color, or national origin discrimination, the Court will grant JBS's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's fourth claim for relief.

III. Plaintiff Fails to Raise a Material Factual Issue as to His Retaliation Claim
"[R]etaliation against an employee because [he] has 'opposed' any practice made unlawful by Title VII," such as creating or condoning a hostile work environment, is forbidden. Lounds v. Lincare, Inc., 812 F.3d 1208, 1233 (10th Cir. 2015) (quoting Stover v. Martinez, 382 F.3d 1064, 1070 (10th Cir. 2004)). "[A] plaintiff bringing a retaliation claim 'must establish that retaliation played a part in the employment decision and may . . . either (1) offer direct evidence that retaliation "played a motivating part" in an employment decision adverse to her interests, or (2) rely upon circumstantial evidence under "the familiar three-part McDonnell Douglas framework to prove that [*26]  the employer's proffered reason for its decision is a pretext for retaliation." Id. (citations omitted). Like his discrimination claim, Hakizimana relies on indirect evidence to demonstrate material issues of fact as to whether he suffered retaliation.
Under McDonnell Douglas' burden-shifting rubric, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation by proving "(1) that he engaged in protected opposition to discrimination, (2) that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, and (3) that a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the materially adverse action." Lounds v. Lincare, Inc., 812 F.3d at 1233-34 (quoting Argo v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kan., Inc., 452 F.3d 1193, 1202 (10th Cir. 2006)). "Satisfying the second component of this prima facie case requires a showing that the 'materially adverse' action was 'such that [the plaintiff] might be dissuaded from making a charge of discrimination,' and satisfying the third (i.e., causal connection) requires 'evidence that ... the motive for the adverse action was [his] opposition to discrimination.'" Id. (citing Somoza v. Univ. of Denver, 513 F.3d 1206, 1213 (10th Cir. 2008) and Petersen v. Utah Dep't of Corr., 301 F.3d 1182, 1189 (10th Cir. 2002)). A plaintiff may demonstrate a causal nexus between his protected conduct and an adverse employment action "by proffering 'evidence of circumstances that justify an inference [*27]  of retaliatory motive, such as protected conduct closely followed by adverse action.'" Id. (citing Stover, 382 F.3d at 1071); see also Anderson v. Coors Brewing Co., 181 F.3d 1171, 1179 (10th Cir. 1999) ("[T]he closer [the challenged action] occurred to the protected activity, the more likely it will support ... causation.").
JBS contends that, to the extent he relies on his police report, Hakizimana fails to meet both the first and third prongs of a prima facie case. First, the Court notes that, to the extent Hakizimana relies on his report3 of a hostile work environment to Jason Miller as "protected activity," the Court has already determined that the proximity between such report and Hakizimana's termination is insufficient to raise a causation issue.
Hakizimana makes clear that he relies on his September 11, 2012 report to the Greeley Police as "protected conduct." JBS counters that the report is not "protected" because Hakizimana did not complain about unlawful activity on the part of JBS in violation of Title VII. The Court finds that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hakizimana, his report to the police that Marceleno stabbed him approximately one week after calling him a "f—ing n—er," and that Hakizimana was afraid of further injury, implies Hakizimana's [*28]  belief that JBS did not rectify the problem. Accordingly, the Court concludes that, for purposes of this analysis, Hakizimana engaged in protected conduct when he reported Marceleno to the police on September 11, 2012.
However, the time period between the report (about which JBS Human Resources representative, Barb Walker, learned the same day) and Hakizimana's termination is not sufficiently "proximate" to raise an inference of a retaliatory motive. While Hakizimana characterizes this period as "just over two months," the period is seventy-three days, or ten weeks and three days. As set forth above, the Tenth Circuit has determined that a period of two to three months is not sufficient alone to establish causation. Meiners, 359 F.3d at 1231. And, Hakizimana points to no evidence during the seventy-three-day period in which the Court might infer a retaliatory motive on the part of Jason Miller or JBS Human Resources.
For Hakizimana's failure to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his protected conduct caused the adverse employment action (termination), the Court will grant JBS's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's second claim for relief.

IV. Plaintiff Raises Material Factual Issues [*29]  as to His Harassment Claim
To survive summary judgment on a hostile-work-environment claim, "a plaintiff must show that a rational jury could find that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of ... employment and create an abusive working environment." Musungayi v. Whirlpool Corp., 401 F. App'x 346, 349 (10th Cir. 2010) (quoting Sandoval v. City of Boulder, Colo., 388 F.3d 1312, 1327 (10th Cir. 2004)). A plaintiff must also submit evidence allowing a jury to infer that he was harassed due to his race or national origin. Id.
JBS contends that Hakizimana can point to no evidence supporting his claim that Marceleno's conduct was based on race; was so severe and pervasive that it altered a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and can be imputed to JBS. The Court disagrees.
With respect to JBS's first contention, Hakizimana's testimony that Marceleno was "angry to him," called him a "n—er" or "f—ing n—er" every day, and never called Hakizimana by his actual name is sufficient to demonstrate Marceleno's unwelcome conduct was based on race. See Lounds, 812 F.3d at 1230 (question is not whether the co-worker intended to harm by using the N-word, but whether the repeated utterance of the term had the effect of contributing to the creation of [*30]  a racially hostile work environment).
Second, "the totality of the circumstances is the touchstone of a hostile work environment analysis" and courts consider a variety of factors "including 'the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'" Id. at 1222 (quoting Hernandez v. Valley View Hosp. Ass'n, 684 F.3d 950, 957 (10th Cir. 2012) and Sprague v. Thorn Ams., Inc., 129 F.3d 1355, 1365 (10th Cir. 1997)). In this case, the evidence demonstrates factual issues as to whether Marceleno's angry attitude and comments were threatening to Hakizimana and whether they eventually culminated in physical injury, which, in turn, was severe enough to alter Hakizimana's conditions of employment. See id. ("It is important to recognize that 'the severity and pervasiveness evaluation is particularly unsuited for summary judgment' because it is inherently fact-found by nature."). Hakizimana testified during his deposition that Marceleno not only called him "n—er" and "f—ing n—er" every day, but also on the day before he cut Hakizimana, Marceleno was "not happy" Hakizimana had to leave the line to clean up after an abscess, saying "where are you going?" Hakizimana dep. 34: 16-25, 35: [*31]  1-11. Then, not long after Hakizimana came back to the line, he felt pain and later learned he had been "slashed" by Marceleno. Id. 35: 16-25, 36: 1-7. The undisputed evidence demonstrates that Marceleno's behavior caused Hakizimana to fear for his safety and to seek assistance from Human Resources, his superintendent and, finally, the police. Following the "slashing," Hakizimana was unable to perform the essential functions of his job. The Court finds Hakizimana raises genuine issues of material fact as to whether Marceleno's conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and created an abusive working environment.
Finally, "[a]n employer may be liable for the racially harassing conduct of its employee under three theories, all of which are derived from the common law of agency: the negligence theory, under which the employer fails to remedy a hostile work environment it 'knew or should have known about;' the actual authority theory, under which an employee harasses another employee within the scope of his employment; or the apparent authority theory, under which the harassing employee acts with apparent authority from the employer." Tademy v. Union Pac. Corp., 614 F.3d 1132, 1147 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting Hollins v. Delta Airlines, 238 F.3d 1255, 1258 (10th Cir. 2001)).
Hakizimana [*32]  argues that all three theories apply; however, it is undisputed that Marceleno, while the cousin of Hakizimana's supervisor, was not a management-level employee who could be said to be acting under the apparent authority of JBS. See Hollins, 238 F.3d at 1259. Moreover, the Tenth Circuit has determined that "harassment simply is not within the job description of any supervisor or any other worker in any reputable business." Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., 833 F.2d 1406, 1418 (10th Cir. 1987). Hakizimana fails to demonstrate how JBS is liable under these two theories.
With respect to the "negligence" theory, however, the Court finds Hakizimana has demonstrated material factual issues as to whether JBS failed to remedy Marceleno's conduct of which it had notice, by failing to investigate Hakizimana's complaint and/or to discipline Marceleno. Hakizimana testified at his deposition that he complained to Miller about Marceleno; Miller referred Hakizimana to his superintendent, who, at a regular work meeting two or three days later, reminded the gutters of the company policy and said, "I don't like to hear those things, you are here to work, not discrimination." Hakizimana dep. 30: 8-25, 31: 1-25. Hakizimana also attested that "things [did not] get better after the meeting." Id. 32: 5-9. [*33]  Miller testified that Hakizimana could have complained to Miller that he had been called "n—er," but Miller did not recall the complaint. Miller dep. 22: 24-25, 23: 1-5.
Accordingly, because Hakizimana demonstrates genuine issues of material fact as to whether JBS knew that Marceleno had repeated called him "n—er" and failed to remedy the conduct, the Court will deny JBS's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's first claim for relief.4

IV. Plaintiff Raises No Material Factual Issue as to His Claim for Failure to Accommodate 5
Hakizimana argues that JBS violated the ADA after he was cut on August 17, 2012 when it "failed to engage in the interactive process at that time, did not engage in any interactive process, and failed to accommodate Plaintiff (e.g. send him home for five days) based on the information that it had available to it." Resp. 33.
Notably, the Tenth Circuit recently addressed whether a plaintiff alleging a "failure to accommodate" under the ADA must demonstrate that the employer took an adverse employment action because of the plaintiff's disability. See Exby-Stolley v. Board of Cty. Comm'rs, 906 F.3d 900 (10th Cir. 2018). The court found that, indeed, such a claim requires a showing of an adverse employment action. Id. at 911 (". . . it is evident [*34]  that the [adverse employment action] requirement applies to every discrimination claim under the ADA, including those based on failure to make reasonable accommodations."). However, the Tenth Circuit granted a rehearing en banc of the decision, and no opinion has issued as of the time of this order. See Exby-Stolley v. Board of Cty. Comm'rs, 910 F.3d 1129 (10th Cir. Dec. 18, 2018).
Nevertheless, the Court finds Hakizimana has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether JBS failed to accommodate his disability. Under the first step of the modified framework, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he "(1) is a disabled person as defined by the ADA; (2) is qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired; and (3) suffered discrimination by an employer or prospective employer because of that disability." Felkins v. City of Lakewood, 774 F.3d 647, 650 (10th Cir. 2014); see also Lincoln v. BNSF Ry. Co., 900 F.3d 1166, 1204 (10th Cir. 2018) (a plaintiff must show "(1) [he] is disabled; (2) [he] is otherwise qualified; and (3) [he] requested a plausibly reasonable accommodation.").
The Court finds that Hakizimana demonstrates he was a "disabled" person who not only suffered a physical impairment that substantially limited his major life activities of walking and standing, but also was regarded as disabled by JBS. [*35]  See id. It is undisputed that JBS contacted Hakizimana's physician to request approval for a modified-duty position; it would not have done so if it did not regard Hakizimana as unable to perform the essential functions of his job as a gutter.
However, the Court finds Hakizimana fails to demonstrate he was "qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation" to perform the gutter job. Again, the undisputed evidence demonstrates he could not perform the job after he was injured. Hakizimana claims that JBS failed to accommodate his "reasonable" request for five days at home after surgery, but he does not show how such accommodation would allow (or, "qualify") him to perform the job. Moreover, to the extent that Hakizimana were required to show an "adverse employment action" for his failure to accommodate claim, he does not explain how JBS's alleged refusal to allow him to stay home for five days constitutes an adverse employment action or otherwise demonstrates how he was treated differently. See E.E.O.C. v. C.R. England, Inc., 644 F.3d 1028, 1038 (10th Cir. 2011) ("to demonstrate 'discrimination,' a plaintiff generally must show that he has suffered an 'adverse employment action because of the disability.'"); see also id. (citing Piercy v. Maketa, 480 F.3d 1192, 1203 (10th Cir. 2007) for the proposition [*36]  that "[t]he [Supreme] Court [has] made clear the substantive discrimination provisions of Title VII are limited 'to [adverse] actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace.'") (quoting Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 62, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006))); see also id. at 1038 n.11 (affirming the court's "consistent" interpretation of the ADA and Title VII due to their similarities).
For Hakizimana's failure to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was a "qualified" individual who suffered discrimination under the ADA, the Court will grant JBS's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's third claim for relief.

CONCLUSION
The Court concludes that Hakizimana raises genuine issues of material fact as to whether his claims were timely filed and whether JBS condoned or tolerated a racially hostile work environment. However, Hakizimana has failed to raise material factual issues as to whether he suffered retaliation and a discriminatory termination based on his race, color, and/or national origin, and as to whether JBS failed to accommodate his disability under the ADA.
Therefore, the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [filed June 28, 2019; ECF 29] is granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiff's second, third, and fourth [*37]  claims are dismissed. This action will proceed on the Plaintiff's first claim for hostile work environment based on his race in violation of Title VII. By separate order, the Court will schedule a Final Pretrial Conference.
SO ORDERED this the 12th day of November, 2019, in Denver, Colorado.
