REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
This Report and Recommendation is submitted to the Honorable Percy Anderson, United States District Judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636 and General Order 05-07 of the United States District Court for the Central District of California.

INTRODUCTION
On May 14, 2020, Francisco Xavier Carbajal, Jr. ("Plaintiff"), a California state prisoner at the California Institute for Men ("CIM") in Chino, California, proceeding pro se, filed a Civil Rights Complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. (Dkt. No. 1). On June 30, 2020, the Court screened the Complaint as prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § 1915A and 42 U.S.C. § 1997e, and dismissed it, with leave to amend, because it failed to state a claim for relief. (Dkt. No. 8). On July 23, 2020, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, along with numerous exhibits. (Dkt. Nos. 9, 9-1, 9-2, 9-3, 9-4, 9-5).
On August 25, 2020, the Court issued an Order dismissing the First Amended Complaint, with leave to amend, for violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and for failure to state a claim for relief. (Dkt. No. 11). The Court gave Plaintiff thirty days to file a Second Amended Complaint, [*2]  if he wished to pursue this action. (Id.). When Plaintiff failed to comply, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause why the case should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute and/or obey court orders. (Dkt. No. 13).
On October 20, 2020, Plaintiff filed a "Motion for Relief" that the Court construed as Objections to the August 25 Order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a). (Dkt. No. 15). On October 26, 2020, the Court denied Plaintiff's motion and again ordered Plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint within thirty days of the Court's Order if he still wished to pursue this action. (Dkt. No. 16). On November 10, 2020, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals seeking review of the Court's October 26 Order, but the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. (Dkt. Nos. 17, 20).
On February 1, 2021, the Court issued another Order to Show Cause directing Plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint within thirty days, and warning him that failure to respond would result in a recommendation that this action be dismissed with prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) for failure to prosecute and obey court orders. (Dkt. No. 22). On February 23, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion for appointment of counsel [*3]  (Dkt. No. 24), which the Court denied without prejudice because "neither the facts nor the legal issues involved in this case are unusually complex," and Plaintiff evidently had "the ability to articulate his claims without the assistance of counsel" (Dkt. No. 25).
On March 11, 2021, Plaintiff filed a "Request for Order," in which he claimed that the Court did not address the arguments he presented in his "cause to prosecute, motion to appoint counsel and memorandum of law." (Dkt. No. 27). On March 16, 2021, the Court issued another Order to Show Cause, giving Plaintiff a "final opportunity" to file a Second Amended Complaint or otherwise demonstrate why this case should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute. (Dkt. No. 28). The Court rejected Plaintiff's contentions in his March 11 "Request for Order," particularly on the ground that all his objections had already been addressed in prior orders. Again, the Court warned Plaintiff that his failure to respond within thirty days - no later than April 16, 2021 - would result in dismissal with prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(b). (Id.).
On March 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed a response to the Court's March 16 Order to Show Cause, in which Plaintiff briefly [*4]  disputes the Court's determination that his First Amended Complaint failed to state an Eighth Amendment deliberate-indifference claim. (Dkt. No. 29). Plaintiff contends that this determination was inconsistent with Ninth Circuit precedent, and he thus insists that the case should proceed with the claims asserted in the First Amended Complaint. (Id.).
More than seven months have passed since the Court dismissed Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint and ordered him to file a Second Amended Complaint. (See Dkt. No. 11). To date, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate grounds for relief from that order, and he still has not filed a Second Amended Complaint - despite having ample time and opportunity to do so, and despite numerous orders warning that the failure to do so would result in the dismissal of this action with prejudice. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed below, it is recommended that this action be DISMISSED with prejudice (1) for failure to prosecute and obey court orders, pursuant to Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and (2) alternatively, for failure to state a claim for relief.

DISMISSAL PURSUANT TO RULE 41(b)

A. Legal Standard
"Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), the district court may dismiss an action for failure to comply with any order of the court." [*5]  Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1260 (9th Cir. 1992); Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b);1see also Van Bronkhorst v. Safeco Corp., 529 F.2d 943, 947 (9th Cir. 1976) ("[A] District Court has the power to dismiss a claim of a plaintiff with prejudice [pursuant to Rule 41(b)] for failure to comply with an order of the court."). Moreover, "[a]ll federal courts are vested with inherent powers enabling them . . . to ensure obedience to their orders." United States v. W.R. Grace, 526 F.3d 499, 509 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ferdik, 963 F.2d at 1260 ("District courts have the inherent power to control their dockets and, '[i]n the exercise of that power they may impose sanctions including, where appropriate, . . . dismissal of a case.'") (citation omitted). "These powers are 'governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.'" Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43, 111 S. Ct. 2123, 115 L. Ed. 2d 27 (1991) (quoting Link v. Walsh R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31 (1991)).
In determining whether to dismiss a case for failure to comply with a court order, district courts must weigh five factors: "(1) the public's interest in expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court's need to manage its docket; (3) the risk of prejudice to the defendant; (4) the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits and (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions."2Olmstead v. Dell, Inc., 594 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). [*6] 
The Ninth Circuit "may affirm a dismissal where at least four factors support dismissal . . . or where at least three factors 'strongly' support dismissal." Yourish v. California Amplifier, 191 F.3d 983, 990 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Hernandez v. City of El Monte, 138 F.3d 393, 399 (9th Cir. 1998)).

B. The Five Factors Support Dismissal

1. The Public's Interest in Expeditious Resolution of Litigation
The Ninth Circuit has explained, as to the first factor, that "[t]he public's interest in expeditious resolution of litigation always favors dismissal." Pagtalunan v. Galaza, 291 F.3d 639, 642 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Yourish, 191 F. 3d at 990) (internal quotation omitted). Here, after more than seven months, Plaintiff has still failed to comply with the Court's orders by filing a Second Amended Complaint. He has instead persisted in delaying this action by neglecting this Court's deadlines and repeating the same contentions that this Court already rejected. (See Dkt. Nos. 25-29). This factor therefore weighs in favor of dismissal. See Pagtalunan, 291 F.3d at 642 (finding that Plaintiff's failure to pursue the case for almost four months weighed in favor of dismissal).

2. The Court's Need to Manage Its Docket
The second factor - the Court's need to manage its docket - similarly weighs in favor of dismissal. Courts have "the power to manage their dockets without being subject to the endless vexatious noncompliance of litigants." [*7]  See Ferdik, 963 F.2d at 1261. Thus, the second factor focuses on whether a particular case has "consumed . . . time that could have been devoted to other cases on the [court's] docket." Pagtalunan, 291 F.3d at 642; see also Edwards v. Marin Park, Inc., 356 F.3d 1058, 1065 (9th Cir. 2004) ("[R]esources continue to be consumed by a case sitting idly on the court's docket.").
Here, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint on August 25, 2020, and gave Plaintiff thirty days to file a Second Amended Complaint. (Dkt. No. 11). When Plaintiff failed to comply, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause why the case should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute and/or obey court orders, which required Plaintiff to respond in writing by October 30, 2020. (Dkt. No. 13). On October 20, 2020, Plaintiff filed a motion that the Court construed as Objections to the August 25 Order. (Dkt. No. 15). On October 26, 2020, the Court denied Plaintiff's motion and again ordered Plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint within thirty days of the Court's Order. (Dkt. No. 16). On November 10, 2020, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals seeking review of the Court's October 26 Order, but the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. (Dkt. Nos. 17, 20). On February [*8]  1, 2021, the Court issued another Order to Show Cause directing Plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint within thirty days. (Dkt. No. 22). On February 23, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion for appointment of counsel (Dkt. No. 24), which the Court denied without prejudice upon concluding that the requested appointment was not warranted given the claims at issue. (Dkt. No. 25). On March 11, 2021, Plaintiff filed a request contending that the Court had not addressed the arguments in his prior motions. (Dkt. No. 27). On March 16, 2021, the Court issued another Order to Show Cause, rejecting Plaintiff's contentions and giving him a "final opportunity" to file a Second Amended Complaint or otherwise demonstrate why this case should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute. (Dkt. No. 28). Plaintiff responded on March 29, 2021, by briefly contending that his First Amended Complaint adequately stated a claim for relief (Dkt. No. 29), despite this Court's reasoned determinations to the contrary.
Through all this, over seven months, Plaintiff has apparently refused to accept the opportunity to amend his complaint and attempt to state viable claims for relief. Plaintiff has persisted in reiterating [*9]  contentions that the Court already rejected, and the Court has expended valuable time preparing the various orders addressing Plaintiff's delays and meritless contentions. As a result, Plaintiff's case has consumed time that could have been devoted to other cases on the Court's docket. See Pagtalunan, 291 F.3d at 642. The Court cannot continue to spend valuable resources attempting to move forward a case that Plaintiff does not wish to expeditiously pursue. Consequently, the Court's need to manage its docket favors dismissal.

3. The Risk of Prejudice to Defendants
The third factor - the risk of prejudice to the defendant - also favors dismissal. "A defendant suffers prejudice if the plaintiff's actions impair the defendant's ability to go to trial or threaten to interfere with the rightful decision of the case." In re Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) Prod. Liab. Litig., 460 F.3d 1217, 1227 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Adriana Int'l Corp. v. Thoeren, 913 F.2d 1406, 1412 (9th Cir. 1990)). "[T]he risk of prejudice to the defendant is related to the plaintiff's reason for defaulting in failing to timely amend." Yourish, 191 F.3d at 991; see also Malone, 833 F.2d at 131 ("Whether prejudice is sufficient to support an order of dismissal is in part judged with reference to the strength of the plaintiff's excuse for the default.").
Plaintiff has proffered no reasonable excuse for his failure to comply with the Court's numerous [*10]  orders, and his refusal to attempt to present viable claims on which this case may proceed. See In re Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) Prod. Liab. Litig., 460 F.3d at 1227 ("The law . . . presumes prejudice from unreasonable delay."); Pagtalunan, 291 F.3d at 643 ("[Unreasonable] delay inherently increases the risk that witnesses' memories will fade and evidence will become stale."); Moneymaker v. CoBen (In re Eisen), 31 F.3d 1447, 1452-53 (9th Cir. 1994) ("[T]he failure to prosecute diligently is sufficient by itself to justify dismissal, even in the absence of a showing of actual prejudice to the defendant from the failure . . . . The law presumes injury from unreasonable delay.") (quoting Anderson v. Air West, Inc., 542 F.2d 522, 524 (9th Cir. 1976)). Given the length of delay and the absence of any justifiable explanation for it, the Court finds Plaintiff's delay in prosecuting this case to be unreasonable. Accordingly, prejudice is presumed and weighs in favor of dismissal.

4. Public Policy Favoring Disposition on the Merits
The fourth factor — the public policy favoring the disposition of cases on their merits — ordinarily, as here, weighs against dismissal. See In re Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) Prod. Liab. Litig., 460 F.3d at 1228. However, "this factor 'lends little support' to a party [such as Plaintiff,] whose responsibility it is to move a case toward disposition on the merits but whose conduct impedes progress in that direction." Id.; see also Morris v. Morgan Stanley & Co., 942 F.2d 648, 652 (9th Cir. 1991) ("Although there is indeed [*11]  a policy favoring disposition on the merits, it is the responsibility of the moving party to move towards that disposition at a reasonable pace, and to refrain from dilatory and evasive tactics."); Moralez v. City of Fresno, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50713, 2006 WL 2085036, at *2 (E.D. Cal. July 25, 2006) ("Public policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits also has little or no weight in actions where plaintiffs lack enough of an interest to file an amended complaint. The public and the court have no interest in determining the truth or falsity of the allegations that Plaintiffs might raise in an amended complaint if Plaintiffs never file an amended complaint.").

5. Availability of Less Drastic Alternatives
Less drastic alternatives to dismissal include warning a party that dismissal could result from failure to obey a court order. See Malone, 833 F.2d at 132 n.1. The Ninth Circuit has explained that "[a] district court need not exhaust every sanction short of dismissal before finally dismissing a case, but must explore possible and meaningful alternatives." Henderson v. Duncan, 779 F.2d 1421, 1424 (9th Cir. 1986). Furthermore, "a district court's warning to a party that his failure to obey the court's order will result in dismissal can satisfy the 'consideration of alternatives' requirement." Ferdik, 963 F.2d at 1262 (citing Malone, 833 F.2d at 132-33; Henderson, 779 F.2d at 1424).
Here, the Court considered and implemented less drastic [*12]  alternatives prior to dismissal. The Court has issued numerous orders explicitly cautioning Plaintiff that a failure to comply with the Orders could result in dismissal of his case. (Dkt. Nos. 11, 13, 16, 22, 28). Thus, Plaintiff should be well aware that his failure to file a Second Amended Complaint would result in a recommendation that the action be dismissed with prejudice for failure to prosecute. On this record, given Plaintiff's protracted refusal to attempt to present viable claims, the Court finds that Plaintiff effectively refuses to prosecute this action, and any less drastic alternatives to dismissal would be inadequate to remedy Plaintiff's failure to prosecute and obey Court orders.

C. Dismissal of This Action Under Rule 41(b) Is Appropriate
As discussed above, four of the Rule 41(b) dismissal factors weigh in favor of dismissal, whereas only one factor (at best) slightly weighs against dismissal. "While the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits weighs against [dismissal], that single factor is not enough to preclude imposition of this sanction when the other four factors weigh in its favor." Rio Prop., Inc. v. Rio Int'l Interlink, 284 F.3d 1007, 1022 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Dreith v. Nu Image, Inc., 648 F.3d 779, 788 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Yourish, 191 F.3d at 990) ("We may affirm a dismissal where at least four factors [*13]  support dismissal, or where at least three factors strongly support dismissal.").
Rule 41(b) states, in relevant part, "dismissal under this subdivision (b) and any dismissal not under this rule - except one for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19 - operates as an adjudication on the merits." Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b). The Court recommends dismissal of this action because of Plaintiff's failure to prosecute and obey Court orders. As this case does not fall into one of the three exceptions set out in Rule 41(b), the dismissal will operate as an adjudication on the merits. The dismissal will thus be with prejudice to Plaintiff's refiling of a new complaint based on the same allegations. See Stewart v. U.S. Bancorp, 297 F.3d 953, 956 (9th Cir. 2002) (dismissal interpreted as an adjudication on the merits unless one of the Rule 41(b) exceptions applies); Owens v. Kaiser Health Plan, Inc., 244 F.3d 708, 714 (9th Cir. 2001) (dismissal for failure to prosecute is treated as adjudication on the merits) (citing United States v. Schimmels (In re Schimmels), 127 F.3d 875, 884 (9th Cir. 1997).

DISMISSAL FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM
As noted above, the Court previously dismissed Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint with leave to amend (Dkt. No. 11), but Plaintiff has effectively refused to file an amended pleading, in defiance of numerous Court orders, which warrants dismissal of this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) for the reasons discussed above. Plaintiff's [*14]  latest filing (Dkt. No. 29) makes it clear that Plaintiff simply wishes to rest on his First Amended Complaint - notwithstanding the Court's determination that it fails to state any viable claim for relief. Plaintiff disputes that determination, to no avail. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed below, this action alternatively warrants dismissal because Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint fails to state any viable claim for relief.3

A. Legal Standard
Congress mandates that district courts initially screen civil complaints filed by prisoners seeking redress from a governmental entity or employee. 28 U.S.C. § 1915A. A court may dismiss such a complaint, or any portion thereof, if the court concludes that the complaint: (1) is frivolous or malicious, (2) fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or (3) seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief. Id. § 1915A(b); see also id. § 1915(e)(2) (The court "shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that . . . the action . . . (i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief."); accord Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1126-27 & n.7 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc). [*15]  In addition, dismissal may be appropriate if a complaint violates Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. McHenry v. Renne, 84 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th Cir. 1996); Nevijel v. Northcoast Life Ins. Co., 651 F.2d 671, 673 (9th Cir. 1981).
In considering whether to dismiss a complaint, a court is generally limited to the pleadings and must construe "[a]ll factual allegations set forth in the complaint . . . as true and . . . in the light most favorable" to the plaintiff. Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Moreover, pro se pleadings are "to be liberally construed" and "held to less stringent standards" than those drafted by a lawyer. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007)(citation omitted). Nevertheless, dismissal for failure to state a claim can be warranted based on either the lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of factual support for a cognizable legal theory. Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr., 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008).

B. First Amended Complaint
Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint claims that the following thirteen Defendants, associated with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation ("CDCR"), and sued in their individual and official capacities, violated Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment rights: (1) Food Services; (2) B. LeMaster, Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") Coordinator and Reasonable Accommodation Panel ("RAP") staff member; (3) A. Banvelos, Acting ADA Coordinator and RAP staff member; (4) J. Gandara, Health Care Appeals Coordinator and RAP staff member; (5) T. Nesbitt, [*16]  Health Care Compliance Analyst and RAP staff member; (6) J. Rivera, Appeals Coordinator and RAP staff member; (7) B. Strobett, Correctional Counselor II and RAP staff member; (8) Kirk Torres, Chief Physician and Surgeon and RAP staff member; (9) Tara Simpson, Correctional Health Care Services Administrator II; (10) J.L. Bishop, Associate Warden, Business Services; (11) M. Farooq, Chief Medical Executive; (12) S. Gates, Chief Health Care Correspondence and Appeals Branch; and (13) T. Le, Chief Physician and Surgeon. (Dkt. No. 9 at 3-7).4
Plaintiff claims that Defendants violated the Eighth Amendment through deliberate indifference in "denying, delaying, or ignoring Plaintiff's duly prescribed Lactose-Free Diet," which Plaintiff allegedly needs because he suffers from ulcerative colitis, a gastrointestinal inflammatory bowel disease. (Id. at 8-9). He seeks monetary and injunctive relief. (Dkt. No. 9-1 at 11).
Plaintiff alleges that he was prescribed a gluten-free diet for his ulcerative colitis in 2015, but his symptoms worsened by 2018, causing him to experience about twenty bowel movements a day, with "liquidy" and bloody stool, as well as chronic pain. (Dkt. No. 9 at 9). Plaintiff alleges that he submitted [*17]  a Health Care Request on January 8, 2019, seeking a dietitian consultation because he had lost over twenty-five pounds in the previous four months. (Id.; see Dkt. No. 9-1 at 19). When the request went unanswered, Plaintiff submitted a grievance on February 21, 2019, providing general information about the symptoms and dietary needs of his ulcerative colitis condition, and asserting that he was not being provided the recommended gluten-free or low-fiber diets. (Dkt. No. 9 at 9-11; see Dkt. No. 9-2 at 1-2). According to Plaintiff, Defendant Dr. T. Le responded to the grievance on April 2, 2019, but "failed to intervene." (Dkt. No. 9 at 11). Dr. Le instead noted that Plaintiff was in the "Chronic Care Program" for his condition, and appropriate diets were provided "as medically or clinically indicated." (Id. at 11; see Dkt. No. 9-2 at 3-4).5
Plaintiff alleges that he submitted an appeal on April 7, 2019, contending that the food being provided did not adequately accommodate his dietary needs, particularly his instructions to avoid high amounts of fiber and purines. (Dkt. No. 9 at 11-12; see Dkt. No. 9-2 at 5). Plaintiff asserted that avoiding such foods "place[d] an unnecessary burden" on him and his family "to supplement [his] intake through Canteen and packages," and still caused him to lose almost forty pounds since September 10, 2018. (Id.).
On April 12, 2019, Plaintiff received a consultation with a physician, Dr. Viernes, and relayed [*19]  his "continuing, distressing problem of having explosive gas with various types of discharge, and significant weight loss." (Dkt. No. 9 at 9). Dr. Viernes "included the 'Lactose-Free diet' and 'moist wipes' in Plaintiff's treatment plan," and noted that Plaintiff's symptoms "may be representative of suboptimally treated left-sided colitis." (Id. at 9-10; see Dkt. No. 9-2 at 9-10). On April 22, 2019, Plaintiff's primary care provider, Dr. Kerk, ordered the lactose-free diet for Plaintiff, apparently based on Dr. Viernes's assessment. (Dkt. No. 9 at 13; see Dkt. No. 9-2 at 12-13).
Plaintiff alleges that he subsequently inquired, several times, whether the prescribed lactose-free diet would be provided to him, but Defendant Food Services kept responding that it was not yet available and sometimes takes a while. (Dkt. No. 9 at 13-14; see Dkt. No. 9-2 at 15). Plaintiff alleges that on May 24, 2019, Nurse Onoigboria made a phone call regarding Plaintiff's diet request, and relayed to Plaintiff that Food Services does not offer a lactose-free diet. (Dkt. No. 9 at 14).
On May 24, 2019, Plaintiff submitted a "Reasonable Accommodation Request," stating that he was unable to "enjoy the major life [*20]  activity of eating" because his doctors' orders were not being followed to treat his ulcerative colitis. (Dkt. No. 9 at 15; see Dkt. No. 9-2 at 17). On May 30, the Defendants in the Reasonable Accommodation Panel (LeMaster, Banvelos, Gandara, Nesbitt, Rivera, Strobett, and Torres; the "RAP Defendants") issued a response denying intervention and stating that "CDCR does not offer a lactose free diet," while noting that Plaintiff was "encouraged to avoid lactose products." (Dkt. No. 9 at 15-16; see Dkt. No. 9-2 at 18).
Plaintiff alleges that on June 10, 2019, Defendant Gates responded to one of Plaintiff's appeals (from April 7) denying relief and falsely stating that Plaintiff's primary care physician had "not document[ed] a current recommendation for outpatient therapeutic diet related to ulcerative colitis management." (Dkt. No. 9 at 16; see Dkt. No. 9-2 at 6-7). On July 26, 2019, Defendant Gandara rejected one of Plaintiff's grievances as duplicative, asserting that "[a] lactose free diet is not a Health Care Services issue." (Dkt. No. 9 at 18).6 Plaintiff appealed this decision on August 5, 2019, contending that Dr. Viernes and Dr. Kerk had prescribed a lactose-free diet, which Food [*21]  Services had failed to provide. (Dkt. No. 9 at 19-20; see Dkt. No. 9-3 at 13, 15). Defendant Rivera denied relief on September 12, 2019, noting that the appeal had already been rejected by health care staff "because it is a CUSTODY issue and NOT a health care issue." (Dkt. No. 9 at 20).
Plaintiff alleges that he met with a registered dietitian on September 20, 2019, who "apologized for the 'gap in [Plaintiff's] medical care,'" and remarked that it was "crazy" that Plaintiff had been at CIM for "so long with [his] medical needs, and had not seen the dietitian sooner." (Dkt. No. 9 at 20).
On September 25, 2019, Defendants Simpson and Bishop responded to an appeal by denying relief and stating that, though Plaintiff's doctor had prescribed a lactose-free diet, lactose-free meals were unavailable. (Dkt. No. 9-1 at 1; see Dkt. No. 9-3 at 1-2). Simpson and Bishop explained that an alternative meal plan was available in place of lactose-free meals, and that Plaintiff was assisted "in making smarter item selections within the meal plan."7 (Id.). Plaintiff appealed, and Defendant Rivera rejected the appeal on procedural grounds on October 24, 2019. (Dkt. No. 9-1 at 2-3; see Dkt. No. 9-3 at 14, [*22]  16; Dkt. No. 9-4 at 1).
Plaintiff alleges that on November 18, 2019, Defendant Farooq continued to deny Plaintiff his "duly prescribed Lactose-Free Diet" and "plac[ed] the burden on Plaintiff 'to shop at Canteen for protein substitutes (plain chicken, ham, etc.) when menu entrée items contain dairy,' rather than adequately supply[ing] food."8 (Dkt. No. 9-1 at 3-4; see Dkt. No. 9-4 at 8-9). When Plaintiff appealed, Defendant Gates denied relief on February 3, 2020. (Dkt. No. 9-1 at 4-6, 7; see Dkt. No. 9-4 at 6-7, 11-12).
On December 3, 2019, Plaintiff submitted a grievance complaining that Dr. Riaz had denied his request for a sedative. (Dkt. No. 9-1 at 6; see Dkt. No. 9-4 at 17). Plaintiff [*23]  contended that he needed a sedative because his ulcerative colitis and arthritic gout were causing pain and physical distress that made it difficult for him to relax. (Id.). According to Plaintiff, Dr. Riaz had "implicitly agreed" that Plaintiff needed a sedative, but the policy did not permit it. (Id.). Defendant Farooq denied relief on February 14, 2020, determining that a sedative was "not medically indicated."9 (Dkt. No. 9-1 at 7-8; see Dkt. No. 9-4 at 18-19).
Plaintiff additionally alleges that he submitted numerous requests and appeals regarding his inadequate fecal-incontinence supplies, such as wipes and diapers, which he allegedly needed urgently because his frequent and uncontrollable bowel movements often caused him to soil his clothing and bedding.10 (See Dkt. Nos. 9 at 12-15, 18-19; Dkt. No. 9-1 at 1-2, 8-10; Dkt. No. 9-5 at 8-14, 17-22).

C. The First Amended Complaint Fails to State a Claim

1. Law Regarding Eighth Amendment Claims
The Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment protects prisoners from inhumane conditions of confinement. Morgan v. Morgensen, 465 F.3d 1041, 1045 (9th Cir. 2006) (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994)). Prison officials therefore have a "duty to ensure that prisoners are provided with adequate shelter, food, clothing, sanitation, medical care, [*24]  and personal safety." Johnson v. Lewis, 217 F.3d 726, 731 (9th Cir. 2000). To establish a violation of this duty, a prisoner must satisfy both an objective and subjective component. See Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991).
First, a prisoner must demonstrate an objectively serious deprivation, one that amounts to "a denial of 'the minimal civilized measures of life's necessities.'" Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1089 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 346, 101 S. Ct. 2392, 69 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1981)). A plaintiff can satisfy the objective component of the deliberate indifference standard by demonstrating that a failure to treat the plaintiff's condition could result in further significant injury or the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. Colwell v. Bannister, 763 F.3d 1060, 1066 (9th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). Indications that a prisoner has a sufficiently serious medical need, so as to implicate the Eighth Amendment, include "[t]he existence of an injury that a reasonable doctor or patient would find important and worthy of comment or treatment; the presence of a medical condition that significantly affects an individual's daily activities; or the existence of chronic and substantial pain." McGuckin v. Smith, 974 F.2d 1050, 1059-60 (9th Cir. 1992), overruled in part on other grounds by WMX Techs., Inc. v. Miller, 104 F.3d 1133 (9th Cir. 1997); accord Wilhelm v. Rotman, 680 F.3d 1113, 1122 (9th Cir. 2012); Lopez, 203 F.3d at 1131.
Second, a prisoner must also demonstrate that prison officials acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind, that of "deliberate indifference." Wilson, 501 U.S. at 303; Johnson, 217 F.3d at 733. A plaintiff can satisfy the subjective component [*25]  of the deliberate indifference standard by showing that a prison official "knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health and safety." Toguchi v. Chung, 391 F.3d 1051, 1057 (9th Cir. 2004). A prison official must "both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference." Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. "This second prong — defendant's response to the need was deliberately indifferent — is satisfied by showing (a) a purposeful act or failure to respond to a prisoner's pain or possible medical need and (b) harm caused by the indifference. Jett v. Penner, 439 F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir. 2006). "[A]n official's failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, cannot . . . be condemned as the infliction of punishment." Farmer, 511 U.S. at 838.
Where a prison doctor has chosen one course of action and a plaintiff contends that the doctor should have chosen another course of action, the plaintiff "must show that the course of treatment the doctor[] chose was medically unacceptable under the circumstances, . . . and the plaintiff must show that [the doctor] chose this course in conscious disregard of an excessive risk to plaintiff's health." Jackson v. McIntosh, 90 F.3d 330, 332 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal citations omitted); see also [*26]  Snow v. McDaniel, 681 F.3d 978, 987 (9th Cir. 2012) ("[a] difference of opinion between a physician and the prisoner - or between medical professionals - concerning what medical care is appropriate does not amount to deliberate indifference" unless the chosen care was "medically unacceptable under the circumstances") (citation and internal quotations omitted), overruled on other grounds, Peralta v. Dillard, 744 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc); see also Hamby v. Hammond, 821 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir. 2016) (same). An inmate's disagreement with the nature of his treatment does not suffice to state a claim for deliberate indifference. See Franklin v. State of Oregon, State Welfare Div., 662 F.2d 1337, 1344 (9th Cir. 1981) ("A difference of opinion between a prisoner-patient and prison medical authorities regarding treatment does not give rise to a § 1983 claim.") (citation omitted).

2. Analysis
Assuming that Plaintiff's ulcerative colitis condition itself constitutes a serious medical condition, Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts showing that Defendants failed to provide constitutionally adequate treatment or otherwise caused him serious harm. To the contrary, Plaintiff's allegations and attached exhibits (from his administrative grievances and appeals) suggest that he received fairly regular consultations with medical doctors, who gave him dietary instructions that involved avoiding certain foods that seemed to [*27]  contribute to his symptoms. Although Plaintiff contends that Defendants failed to provide him with meals that catered exclusively to these dietary needs - such as by providing specifically "lactose-free meals" - Plaintiff does not allege sufficient facts showing that he was actually unable to obtain enough foods to fulfill the dietary recommendations, and he does not allege that the medical recommendations themselves were constitutionally deficient.
For example, Plaintiff alleges that after his condition started worsening in 2018, he submitted a request for a dietary consultation on January 8, 2019. (Dkt. No. 9 at 9). Although Plaintiff asserts that Defendants then failed to grant him the consultation or to provide him the recommended gluten-free or lowfiber diets (Dkt. No. 9 at 9-12), his attached exhibits indicate, among other things, that Plaintiff saw a gastroenterologist on January 24 and his primary care physician on February 25, and was instructed to eat a low-fiber diet. (Dkt. No. 9-2 at 3). Plaintiff contends that avoiding high-fiber foods (as well as high purine food due to gout) "place[d] an unnecessary burden" on him and his family "to supplement [his] intake through Canteen [*28]  and packages." (Dkt. No. 9 at 11-12). However, he does not clarify the nature of this "burden," and he does not clearly indicate that he was unable to obtain adequate low-fiber foods by such means. In addition, to the extent that a low-fiber diet did not relieve his symptoms, Plaintiff does not allege facts showing that this medical recommendation was "medically unacceptable" and was done "in conscious disregard of an excessive risk to [P]laintiff's health." Jackson, 90 F.3d at 332.
Plaintiff alleges that in April 2019, his doctors prescribed a lactose-free diet, and Defendants failed to ever provide him with specifically "lactose-free meals." (See Dkt. No. 9 at 9-15). However, while Plaintiff claims this "plac[ed] the burden on Plaintiff to shop at Canteen for protein substitutes (plain chicken, ham, etc.) when menu entrée items contain dairy" (Dkt. No. 9-1 at 3-4) (internal quotation omitted), he does not indicate how it "burden[ed]" him, and he does not allege facts showing that he was actually unable to obtain enough non-dairy foods. Moreover, according to attached documents, at least by September 2019, Plaintiff was provided with an alternative meal plan in the form of the "Pre-Renal Diet," with soy [*29]  milk substitution, along with instruction from a dietitian about how to avoid dairy foods and obtain adequate protein substitutes from the canteen when needed. (See Dkt. No. 9-3 at 19; Dkt. No. 9-4 at 9). Although Plaintiff complains that this placed the "burden" on him, he does not contradict the report, in an attached document, stating that in an October 1, 2019 follow-up consultation with the dietitian, Plaintiff "reported satisfaction with the change to renal diet and soy milk substitution" and "stated it seemed to be working," resulting in fewer bowel movements and increased appetite. (Dkt. No. 9-4 at 9). Plaintiff was also apparently provided with a lactase enzyme replacement, in October 2019, based on the dietitian's recommendation. (Id.).
Even if Plaintiff may have continued to suffer serious symptoms, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that this was caused by Defendants' own conduct (or inaction), and that such conduct was carried out knowing the serious risk of harm to Plaintiff. Moreover, even if Plaintiff alleges that Defendants knew the seriousness of Plaintiff's symptoms, Plaintiff fails to show that each Defendant had the ability to alleviate those symptoms and failed to [*30]  do so. Such allegations are required to state a claim against Defendants. See Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d 628, 633 (9th Cir. 1988) (allegations regarding Section 1983 causation "must be individualized and focus on the duties and responsibilities of each individual defendant whose acts or omissions are alleged to have caused a constitutional deprivation").
Because Plaintiff has not provided such allegations against Defendants, the First Amended Complaint fails to state an Eighth Amendment claim. Plaintiff has recently asserted, without elaboration, that this conclusion is inconsistent with certain cases from the Ninth Circuit. (See Dkt. No. 29 at 1). However, each of the cases cited by Plaintiff appears distinguishable from this case based on the facts discussed above - including Defendants' efforts to provide Plaintiff with adequate alternatives, of which no mention is made in these other cases. See Lopez, 203 F.3d at 1131-32 (doctors ordered that clear liquid diet be fed to inmate whose jaw was wired shut, but prison officials instead insisted on giving the inmate a puree diet he could not suck through straw, causing him to lose up to twenty-two pounds); Wakefield v. Thompson, 177 F.3d 1160, 1164 (9th Cir. 1999) (prison official failed to provide psychotropic medication prescribed by prison physician, and refused to make any effort to assist [*31]  inmate in locating or obtaining the prescribed medication); Balla v. Idaho State Bd. of Corr., 595 F. Supp. 1558, 1574 (D. Idaho 1984) (unrefuted facts demonstrated that several inmates' lack of special diets was a contributing factor in inmates' respective medical harms, which included blindness and an extended hospital stay), rev'd, 869 F.2d 461 (9th Cir. 1989)).11 Accordingly, the First Amended Complaint appropriately warrants dismissal for failure to state a claim for relief.

D. Plaintiff Should Not Be Granted Leave to Amend
Leave to amend should be freely given "when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). "[T]his policy is to be applied with extreme liberality." Desertrain v. City of Los Angeles, 754 F.3d 1147, 1154 (9th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). When dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim, "a district court should grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts." Lopez, 203 F.3d at 1127 (citation omitted). Nevertheless, a court "may exercise its discretion to deny leave to amend due to 'undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party and futility of amendment.'" Carvalho v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC, 629 F.3d 876, 892 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962)) (alterations omitted). If amendment [*32]  would be futile, the court may dismiss the complaint with prejudice. Mujica v. AirScan Inc., 771 F.3d 580, 593 & n.8 (9th Cir. 2014).
Here, as discussed above, the Court initially gave Plaintiff leave to amend his claims. Over more than seven months, after numerous opportunities, he has apparently refused to comply by filing a Second Amended Complaint. Due to Plaintiff's repeated refusal to comply, further leave to amend would be futile. Plaintiff's claims should therefore be dismissed with prejudice and without leave to amend.

RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Court issue an Order (1) accepting and adopting this Report and Recommendation; and (2) directing that Judgment be entered dismissing this action with prejudice.
