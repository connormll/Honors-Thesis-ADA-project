Opinion



ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WHY THE CASE IS NOT MOOT AND SHOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE DISMISSED
The Court has given Plaintiff Alejandro Hernandez two opportunities to submit evidence showing that this case is not moot. Mem. Order, ECF No. 28, at 2-3; Supp. Evid. Order, ECF No. 36. Although Plaintiff has taken advantage of both of those opportunities, none of the evidence he has submitted so far suffices to prove this case is not moot. See Pl.'s 1st Decl., ECF No. 33; Pl.'s 2d Decl., ECF No. 39. The Court will now provide Hernandez an opportunity to file a brief addressing why the Court should not dismiss his federal claim as moot and why, if it is moot, the Court should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claim. Hernandez must also address whether he improperly joined Defendant John Doe.

I. BACKGROUND

A. Factual Background
Hernandez claims that a food bank, El Pasoans Fighting Hunger, as well as Jose "Abe" Gonzalez and Susan E. Goodall (collectively, the "Food Bank")1 violated Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") by failing to accommodate his disability, [*2]  which, Hernandez asserts, prevents him from wearing a face mask. Hernandez has asked the Court to issue an injunction requiring the Food Bank to provide him a reasonable accommodation—namely, an injunction allowing him to patronize El Pasoans Fighting Hunger without wearing a face covering.

B. Procedural Background
On April 8, 2021, after U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert F. Castañeda granted Hernandez's motion to proceed in forma pauperis, see IFP Order, ECF No. 3, the Clerk of Court docketed Hernandez's Original Complaint, see Original Compl., ECF No. 4. Two weeks later, Judge Castañeda issued a Report and Recommendation finding Hernandez's failed to state a claim and that his allegations were frivolous. R. & R., ECF No. 5, at 4-6. Judge Castañeda recommended that the Court dismiss Hernandez's Original Complaint without prejudice. Id. at 1, 6.
Hernandez objected to Judge Castañeda's recommendation, see Objs., ECF No. 7, but this Court for the most part agreed with the recommendation and dismissed Hernandez's Original Complaint for being frivolous and failure to state a claim, Hernandez v. El Pasoans Fighting Hunger, No. EP-21-CV-00055-DCG, 2021 WL 2763827, at *3-6 (W.D. Tex. July 1, 2021) [hereinafter Hernandez I2021) [hereinafter Hernandez I]. The Court departed with Judge Castañeda's recommendation [*3]  only insofar as he recommended dismissal without prejudice; this Court dismissed with prejudice. Hernandez I, 2021 WL 2763827, *6.
The Court issued a final judgment on July 1, 2021, see Final J., ECF No. 10, which Hernandez then asked the Court to reconsider, see Mot. Amend J., ECF No. 12. Subsequently, the Court ordered Hernandez to submit a proposed amended complaint so it could determine whether providing him relief from the judgment and ultimately leave to amend his Original Complaint would be futile. Order Proposed Am. Compl., ECF No. 14. Hernandez filed his Proposed Amended Complaint on September 2, 2021. Proposed Am. Compl., ECF No. 17. On March 1, 2022, the Court "conclude[d] that providing Hernandez leave to amend would be futile" and therefore denied his motion to alter or amend the judgment. Hernandez v. El Pasoans Fighting Hunger, No. EP-21-CV-00055-DCG, 2022 WL 617618, at *5, 7 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 1, 2022) [hereinafter Hernandez II22) [hereinafter Hernandez II]. On March 30, 2022, Hernandez appealed the Court's order dismissing his complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2). Notice Appeal, ECF No. 20; see also Hernandez I, 2021 WL 2763827, *6.
On December 30, 2022, the Fifth Circuit ruled on Hernandez's appeal.2 Hernandez v. El Pasoans Fighting Hunger, No. 22-50240, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 36000, 2022 WL 18019437 (5th Cir. Dec. 30, 2022) (per curiam) (unpublished). The Fifth Circuit remanded part of this case for this Court's further consideration. 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 36000, [WL] at *7. Specifically, the Fifth Circuit has directed this Court to determine "whether dismissal with prejudice is [*4]  warranted and whether Hernandez should be afforded leave to amend his Complaint." Id. In making that determination, the Fifth Circuit has also directed this Court to first "consider if Hernandez's claim is moot" because of the possibility that the Food Bank is no longer requiring patrons to wear face coverings, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 36000, [WL] at *7 n.3, which is an essential factual predicate for Hernandez's ADA claim, see generally Original Compl.; Proposed Am. Compl.
In accordance with the Fifth Circuit's remand order, this Court ordered Hernandez to submit a second proposed amended complaint so that it could determine whether he should be afforded leave to amend his complaint if the case is not moot. Mem. Order at 3. This Court also determined that Hernandez needed "to submit evidence regarding whether Defendants El Pasoans Fighting Hunger, Jose 'Abe' Gonzalez, and Susan E. Goodall still maintain the face covering policy that formed the basis of Plaintiff's complaint." Id. (emphasis omitted).
Hernandez filed his Second Proposed Amended Complaint and in it he added, for the first time, a supplemental state law claim alleging that a John Doe assaulted him at one of El Pasoans Fighting Hunger's distribution locations.3 2d Proposed [*5]  Am. Compl., ECF No. 35 ¶¶ 13-15, 17, 31, 41, 43-45.
Hernandez also submitted evidence regarding the status of this case two days after his deadline passed.4 Pl.'s 1st Decl. In its entirety, Hernandez submitted the following declaration:
Plaintiff, Alejandro Hernandez, hereby states that he has asked around to some people that go to the food pantry and has been told that the food pantry still requires face coverings at their walk-up locations. I declare state [sic] under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
Id. He provided no other evidence of his contention that the Food Bank still requires face coverings. The Court concluded that "[t]his evidence does not suffice to prove this case is not moot" and afforded Hernandez another opportunity to submit evidence. Supp. Evid. Order at 1-3. Hernandez timely submitted the following, in relevant part:
On March 18, 2023, Plaintiff inquired with Defendants' website for direction on their current policy. The website still states that it offers the home delivery program; one must register for the program to have food delivered. However, as Plaintiff alleges in his complaint, the food delivery program has been practically [*6]  ineffective for Plaintiff. The website does not mention anything about persons who cannot wear a face covering because of a disability. I declare state [sic] under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
Pl.'s 2d Decl. at 1.
Having provided Hernandez two opportunities to submit evidence regarding the status of the Food Bank's face covering policy, the Court must decide whether Hernandez has shown there is still a live dispute that provides this Court with jurisdiction. See Mem. Order at 3 (explaining that Hernandez could "submit any form of evidence, including affidavits, stipulations, admissions, documents (such as a copy of the policy, if there is one, or emails between Plaintiff and Defendants)"); Supp. Evid. Order at 1-2 & n.1 (similar but providing greater detail about what might be potentially persuasive evidence).

II. MOOTNESS
Article III of the U.S. Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to "cases" or "controversies," U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2, cl. 1, which exist when there is an "actual controversy" for which "the parties maintain a concrete interest in the outcome and effective relief is available to remedy the effect of the [alleged] violation," Env't Conservation Org. v. City of Dallas, 529 F.3d 519, 527 (5th Cir. 2008) (cleaned up). Put another way, a federal court loses jurisdiction [*7]  over a case if the case becomes moot.5 E.g., North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S. Ct. 402, 30 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1971) ("Mootness is a jurisdictional question because the Court is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions." (quotation omitted)); Ermuraki v. Renaud, 987 F.3d 384, 386 (5th Cir. 2021).
Generally, once the conduct or conditions a plaintiff filed suit over are no longer occurring or in existence, the plaintiff's lawsuit is moot. Env't Conservation Org., 529 F.3d at 527 ("As a general rule, any set of circumstances that eliminates actual controversy after the commencement of a lawsuit renders that action moot." (quotation omitted)). "It is not enough that a dispute was very much alive when the suit was filed; the parties must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit." Id. (quoting Lewis v. Cont'l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477-78 (1990)) (cleaned up).
"[F]ederal courts are duty-bound to examine the basis of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte." Colvin v. LeBlanc, 2 F.4th 494, 498 (5th Cir. 2021) (quotation omitted). If a court discovers at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, then "sua sponte dismissal is mandatory." Carver v. Atwood, 18 F.4th 494, 497 (5th Cir. 2021); FED. R. CIV. P. 12(h)(3).
"The burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction lies with the party asserting jurisdiction,"—here, Hernandez—"and it must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence." In re S. Recycling, LLC, 982 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir. 2020).

III. SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION
As stated, when Hernandez filed his second proposed [*8]  amended complaint, he, for the first time in this case, brought a supplemental state law claim alleging that a John Doe assaulted him at one of El Pasoans Fighting Hunger's distribution locations. 2d Proposed Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13-15, 17, 31, 41, 43-45.
Assuming, without deciding, that Hernandez's ADA claim—his only federal claim—is moot, the Court must decide whether it should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Hernandez's state law claim. Congress has authorized courts
to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim [] if:
(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law,
(2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims which the district court has original jurisdiction,
(3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or
(4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.
Mendoza v. Murphy, 532 F.3d 342, 346 (5th Cir. 2008) (emphasis added) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)); see also Hernandez v. Roche, No. EP-20-CV-00263-DCG, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158821, 2022 WL 4072963, at *6-8 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 2, 2022) (declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claim), aff'd No. 22-50927, 2023 WL 5645548, at *1 (5th Cir. Mar. 27, 2023) (per curiam) (unpublished). Indeed, "[t]he general rule is that a court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over remaining state-law claims when all federal-law claims [*9]  are eliminated before trial." Brookshire Bros. Holding, Inc. v. Dayco Prods., Inc., 554 F.3d 595, 602 (5th Cir. 2009). This general rule extends to when a court dismisses a plaintiff's federal claim as moot. See, e.g., Bacon v. Walgreen Co., 91 F. Supp. 3d 446, 453 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction after dismissing plaintiff's federal claim as moot).
Thus, Hernandez must tell the Court why it should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claim if the Court concludes that it should dismiss his federal claim as moot.

IV. MISJOINDER
Even if the Court should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Hernandez's state law claim—something the Court does not decide here—it is not clear that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow Hernandez to join the John Doe defendant. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20(a)(2) allows a plaintiff to join a defendant if:
(A) any right to relief is asserted against [the defendants] jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and
(B) any question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(2). "If these requirements are not met, joinder is improper." Crockett v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 436 F.3d 529, 533 (5th Cir. 2006). The Seventh Circuit has put it simply: "Claim A against Defendant 1 should not be joined with unrelated Claim B against Defendant [*10]  2. Unrelated claims against different defendants belong in different suits." George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007) (emphasis added).
Here, the Seventh Circuit's formulation is this: Hernandez's state law assault claim against Defendant John Doe should not be joined with his unrelated ADA claim against the Food Bank. Compare 2d Proposed Am. Compl., with George, 507 F.3d at 607. For example, it is not clear that Hernandez's allegation that John Doe "physical[ly] assault[ed]" him by "repeatedly push[ing] [him] out of the building," see 2d Proposed Am. Compl. ¶ 13, arises "out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences" that form the basis of Hernandez's ADA claim against the Food Bank, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(2)(A). Cf. also Hernandez v. Roche, No. EP-20-CV-00263-DCG, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158821, 2022 WL 4072963, at *6-8 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 2, 2022) (declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction because claims did not share a common nucleus of operative fact), aff'd No. 22-50927, 2023 WL 5645548, at *1 (5th Cir. Mar. 27, 2023) (per curiam) (unpublished).

V. CONCLUSION
The Court doubts—but does not yet decide—that Hernandez has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the Court has jurisdiction. See, e.g., Resurrection Sch. v. Hertel, 35 F.4th 524, 528-30 (6th Cir. 2022) (holding challenge to Michigan's mask mandate was moot because "the State rescinded the mandate not in response to [the] lawsuit" but for other reasons related to changes in the pandemic and the response to it); [*11]  Clark v. Governor of New Jersey, 53 F.4th 769, 775-81 (3d Cir. 2022) (similar); see also Hernandez v. El Pasoans Fighting Hunger, No. 22-50240, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 36000, 2022 WL 18019437, at *7 n.3 (5th Cir. Dec. 30, 2022) (per curiam) (unpublished) (suggesting this case may be moot because "many health precautions, including masking requirements, have abated" since Plaintiff filed his Original Complaint). That is because none of Hernandez's evidence shows that the Food Bank still requires face coverings. Put plainly, if Hernandez can now go to the Food Bank without a face covering, his ADA claim is likely moot because the injunction Hernandez requests would be meaningless. He would, by virtue of the Food Bank's recission of its mandatory face covering policy, have the relief he requests; no reasonable accommodation would be needed.
Before issuing a decision, however, the Court will provide Hernandez with an opportunity to file a brief addressing why he thinks this case is not moot, if he does in fact think that. The Court will also provide Hernandez with the opportunity to address whether the Court should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claim if his federal claim is moot, and whether, in any event, Defendant John Doe is properly joined under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20(a)(2).
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Alejandro Hernandez to FILE a BRIEF, by May 18, 2023, addressing:
(1) why this case is not [*12]  moot and why the Court should not dismiss his case for want of jurisdiction;
(2) why, assuming Hernandez's ADA claim is moot, the Court should still exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claim; and
(3) why Defendant John Doe is not improperly joined under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20(a)(2).
Plaintiff Alejandro Hernandez's brief must be limited to 20 pages double-spaced.
So ORDERED and SIGNED this 27th day of April 2023.
