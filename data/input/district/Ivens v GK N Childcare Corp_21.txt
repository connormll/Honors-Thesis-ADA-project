Opinion



OPINION AND ORDER
Latanya Ivens was diagnosed with lupus in 2019. She discussed taking time off with her employer, GK North Childcare Corp. (doing business as Growing Kids), about the same time the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020. She was laid off because of the pandemic, and she received two weeks of additional leave after she was scheduled to return in May 2020—though she wanted a few days longer. She never returned to work. She hasn't felt safe to return during the pandemic. She sues for interference and retaliation under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and failure to accommodate under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Growing Kids asks for summary judgment on all claims. The court grants the motion.
BACKGROUND
Ms. Ivens began her career as a preschool teacher at Growing Kids in 2002. This position required her presence at Growing Kids and her interaction with students. She began experiencing [*2]  symptoms of lupus in 2018. Lupus affected her joints and ability to stand or sit for long periods of time. It was challenging for her to do things like play in the ball pit with the kids, pick them up, or lay down cots for them. To cope with the symptoms, she stopped sitting in kid-sized chairs and interacted differently with the children during play time.
In January 2019, Dr. Robert Cassady and Dr. Brent Mohr diagnosed Ms. Ivens with lupus. They didn't place any work restrictions on her then, though they gave her a list of things to do to avoid flare ups, such as avoiding sunlight, cold, and stress. Ms. Ivens discussed this diagnosis with her supervisor, Lori Timm, and another individual in Growing Kids' human resources department, though she didn't ask for a change in her work responsibilities. Her doctors also gave her some prescriptions and exercises, which did not alleviate the lupus symptoms. Ms. Ivens says she experienced side effects from the medications, including itching and swelling in her lips and tongue.
On March 24, 2020, Ms. Ivens spoke with her supervisor and later with Human Resources Director Angela Stearns about taking time off due to itching and biting her tongue. [*3]  The HR director suggested Ms. Ivens wait a couple days, saying a layoff was coming and telling Ms. Ivens, "You can read between the lines on that. I can't tell you why. But you may not need to take the time off." Two days later, Growing Kids laid Ms. Ivens off and nearly all the teachers at Growing Kids due to low enrollment from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ms. Ivens collected unemployment during March and April 2020 and remained eligible to participate in Growing Kids' group health plan.
On May 5, 2020, Ms. Ivens spoke with her supervisor about returning to work on May 11, 2020. That same day, Ms. Ivens also requested a note from her doctor stating that she could not return "until this pandemic is over." Ms. Ivens asked the HR director for additional time off because she was at high risk for COVID-19 with her lupus, and she was having a sore throat, runny nose, and allergy symptoms. Ms. Ivens took a COVID-19 test, and the results were negative. She didn't know when she would return, telling the HR director (and Area Director Emily Magagula) that she would return once her side effects cleared up and her medicine was regulated.
On May 7, the HR director mailed Ms. Ivens a letter outlining [*4]  how she could apply for leave under the FMLA. Ms. Ivens says she never saw the letter. On May 11, the HR director mailed Ms. Ivens a letter outlining how she could apply for an accommodation under the ADA. Ms. Ivens says she never saw this letter either.
On May 11, both her company supervisor and HR director emailed one other. The supervisor reported that Ms. Ivens "said she wanted me to know that she isn't coming back tomorrow. That's fine—didn't need her today or tomorrow or the day after[.]" The next day, her supervisor expressed to the HR director that Ms. Ivens's attitude was "toxic" and that she was "making a big show so she can have a dramatic reentry."
Thereafter, Ms. Ivens received a letter dated May 12, 2020 that memorialized a conversation among her, her supervisor, and the HR director. The letter informed Ms. Ivens that she had requested personal leave, not FMLA benefits or a medical leave of absence, and that she needed to submit documentation from her medical provider about her fear of being at "high risk." Ms. Ivens says she never mentioned the word "personal" and was concerned about her lupus more than COVID-19. Though she denies saying she wasn't requesting FMLA or medical [*5]  leave, she never contacted the HR director to correct the information in the May 12 letter.
On May 20, Ms. Ivens discussed her lupus symptoms and medication side effects with Dr. Cassady, though she didn't ask for a note from him. He didn't tell her she couldn't go to work or impose any restrictions on her. He couldn't predict dates that Ms. Ivens needed to be off work because they "didn't know how long the pandemic was going to last." That same day, Dr. Cassady sent the HR director a note that said Ms. Ivens "has a chronic medical problem (lupus) that puts her at higher risk of serious complications of COVID-19."
Without other documentation from Ms. Ivens' doctor, Growing Kids gave Ms. Ivens personal leave through May 26, 2020. As of May 26, 2020, no healthcare provider told Ms. Ivens that she couldn't return to work because of the side effects of her lupus.
Just before, on May 21, the HR director advised Ms. Ivens through text that if she did not return to work on May 26, 2020 that Growing Kids would consider that to mean she was rejecting an offer to work and voluntarily resigning. Ms. Ivens said she wanted time off through June 1. The HR director said other people had lupus yet still [*6]  had to decide whether to resign or return. After going back and forth on dates, the HR director said, "Just tell me if you're coming back on the 26th." Ms. Ivens responded, "Okay fine."
Ms. Ivens didn't return to work on May 26 because she "got up that morning and got dressed and kind of had a little bit of a mental breakdown and just didn't feel like [she] wanted to go." She also didn't feel safe to return because of her lupus and the COVID-19 pandemic. She didn't tell anyone at Growing Kids she wasn't working that day. When Ms. Ivens didn't show up, the HR director emailed a colleague, "I figured we would play it safe and let her No Call No Show two days in a row per the handbook and then we are good to term."
Ms. Ivens texted Growing Kids President Michael Garatoni, asking to speak about her position. He responded the next day that she needed to present her employment concerns through human resources. Either May 21 or May 27, 2020, she responded that she was leaving Growing Kids.1 The company's area director texted Ms. Ivens: "you didn't call anyone and you didn't show up." Ms. Ivens didn't respond. She never spoke with anyone at Growing Kids again. She never applied for rehire at [*7]  Growing Kids. According to the HR director, Ms. Ivens has been at all times eligible for rehire because she voluntarily resigned.
STANDARD
Summary judgment is warranted when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The non-moving party must present the court with evidence on which a reasonable jury could rely to find in his favor. Weaver v. Speedway, LLC, 28 F.4th 816, 820 (7th Cir. 2022). The court must construe all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, viewing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor, Bigger v. Facebook, Inc., 947 F.3d 1043, 1051 (7th Cir. 2020), and avoid "the temptation to decide which party's version of the facts is more likely true," Payne v. Pauley, 337 F.3d 767, 770 (7th Cir. 2003); see also Joll v. Valparaiso Cmty. Schs., 953 F.3d 923, 924-25 (7th Cir. 2020).
In performing its review, the court "is not to sift through the evidence, pondering the nuances and inconsistencies, and decide whom to believe." Waldridge v. Am. Hoechst Corp., 24 F.3d 918, 920 (7th Cir. 1994). Instead, the "court has one task and one task only: to decide, based on the evidence of record, whether there is any material dispute of fact that requires a trial." Id. The court must grant a summary judgment motion when no such genuine factual issue—a triable issue—exists under the law. Luster v. Ill. Dep't of Corr., 652 F.3d 726, 731 (7th Cir. 2011).
DISCUSSION
A. Interference and Retaliation under the Family and Medical Leave Act [*8]  (FMLA).
Under the FMLA, an employee with a serious health condition that makes her unable to perform her job functions may receive up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D); see Ames v. Hope Depot USA, Inc., 629 F.3d 665, 668 (7th Cir. 2011). The FMLA forbids employers from "interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing], or deny[ing] the exercise of, or the attempt to exercise" this right. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1).
To pursue a claim for FMLA interference, Ms. Ivens must show that (1) she was eligible for FMLA protections, (2) she was entitled to take leave under FMLA, (3) Growing Kids was covered by FMLA, (4) she provided Growing Kids sufficient notice to take leave, and (5) Growing Kids denied or interfered with her FMLA benefits. Preddie v. Bartholomew Consol. Sch. Corp., 799 F.3d 806, 818 (7th Cir. 2015); Goelzer v. Sheboygan Cnty., 604 F.3d 987, 993 (7th Cir. 2010). The denial of FMLA benefits must have caused Ms. Ivens actual harm or prejudice. Ziccarelli v. Dart, 35 F.4th 1079, 1089 (7th Cir. 2022).
The court evaluates an FMLA retaliation claim the same way retaliation or discrimination claims are evaluated under other labor statutes. Pagel v. Tin Inc., 695 F.3d 622, 631 (7th Cir. 2012). The law uses a holistic approach that poses a singular question: whether the evidence would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the plaintiff's exercise of her FMLA rights was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action against her. See Anderson v. Nations Lending Corp., 27 F.4th 1300, 1307 (7th Cir. 2022); McDaniel v. Progress Rail Locomotive, Inc., 940 F.3d 360, 367-68 (7th Cir. 2019).
Before reaching the merits, the court considers whether [*9]  Ms. Ivens has a remedy under the FMLA. See Hickey v. Protective Life Corp., 988 F.3d 380, 387-88 (7th Cir. 2021); Cianci v. Pettibone Corp., 152 F.3d 723, 728-29 (7th Cir. 1998). When an employer violates an employee's FMLA rights, the employee may seek as damages "any wages, salary, employment benefits, or other compensation denied or lost to such employee by reason of the violation." 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I). Otherwise, the employee may seek "any actual monetary losses sustained by the employee as a direct result of the violation, such as the cost of providing care." 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(II). The court may also award "equitable relief as may be appropriate, including employment, reinstatement, and promotion." 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(B). To recover under the FMLA, a plaintiff must show that she suffered damage that (1) is redressable under § 2617 and (2) results from the alleged interference. See Hickey, 988 F.3d at 387. "In the absence of such evidence, summary judgment for the employer is appropriate." Id.
Growing Kids argues that, even if the company interfered with Ms. Ivens' FMLA rights or retaliated against her, the record doesn't show that she suffered damages from the violation. Ms. Ivens curiously doesn't respond to this argument. A "party opposing a summary judgment motion must inform the trial judge of the reasons, legal or factual, why summary judgment should not be entered," or such argument is waived. [*10]  Mahran v. Advoc. Christ Med. Ctr., 12 F.4th 708, 713 (7th Cir. 2021).
Ms. Ivens argues she was terminated, though she never argues that she wants equitable relief in the form of reinstatement under 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(B).2 Even if Ms. Ivens sought equitable relief in the form of reinstatement, it seems that such relief wouldn't be appropriate. At her deposition, Ms. Ivens testified that she probably could have returned to work "after the physical things had maybe ceased." When pressed as to when these physical symptoms subsided to the point that Ms. Ivens could have returned to work, she responded, "I don't know that they have." When asked when she would have felt safe returning to work due to the pandemic, she said she couldn't put a date on it. When asked whether she would feel safe returning to work at Growing Kids today, she responded, "Not really. Are you referring to my health? . . . No."
In the absence of a redressable harm 29 U.S.C. § 2617, the court must grant summary judgment for Growing Kids on the FMLA interference and retaliation claims. See Hickey, 988 F.3d at 387.
B. Accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
The ADA exists to eliminate "discrimination against individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). It applies to qualified individuals "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of [*11]  the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). One type of claim under the ADA is a failure-to-accommodate claim. Stern v. St. Anthony's Health Ctr., 788 F.3d 276, 285 n.4 (7th Cir. 2015).
For an ADA failure-to-accommodate claim, Ms. Ivens must show she was a qualified individual with a disability, her employer was aware of her disability, and her employer failed to accommodate her disability reasonably. Scheidler v. Indiana, 914 F.3d 535, 541 (7th Cir. 2019). A "qualified individual" is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
"Time off may be an apt accommodation for intermittent conditions. Someone with arthritis or lupus may be able to do a given job even if, for brief periods, the inflammation is so painful that the person must stay home." Severson v. Heartland Woodcraft, Inc., 872 F.3d 476, 481 (7th Cir. 2017). "The ADA does not require an employer to accommodate an employee who suffers a prolonged illness by allowing [her] an indefinite leave of absence." Nowak v. St. Rita High Sch., 142 F.3d 999, 1004 (7th Cir. 1998). "An employer is generally permitted to treat regular attendance as an essential job requirement and need not accommodate erratic or unreliable attendance. A plaintiff whose disability prevents her from coming to work regularly cannot perform the essential functions of her job, [*12]  and thus cannot be a qualified individual for ADA purposes." Taylor-Novotny v. Health All. Med. Plans, Inc., 772 F.3d 478, 489-90 (7th Cir. 2014).
Growing Kids argues that Ms. Ivens didn't need an accommodation because she could perform all the essential functions of her job while at work without an accommodation, and Ms. Ivens hasn't shown otherwise. Alternatively, if Ms. Ivens couldn't come to work at all for the duration of the pandemic due to her lupus, then Growing Kids asserts that this rendered her unqualified to perform her job.
Ms. Ivens argues that her lupus caused her to call off once every few weeks for appointments, pain, swelling, tongue biting, and acid reflux, entitling her to ADA benefits. Ms. Ivens could take advantage of ADA protections without having limitations while at work if her lupus periodically prevented her from working at all. Severson, 872 F.3d at 481. But her testimony shows that the duration of her absence would have been anything but periodic. She was laid off during the pandemic just a couple days after she first inquired of the possibility of leave for her lupus. Ms. Ivens didn't feel safe to return to work on May 11, 2020 due to her high risk with lupus. On May 26, when she was scheduled to return, Ms. Ivens "got up that morning and got dressed and kind of [*13]  had a little bit of a mental breakdown and just didn't feel like [she] wanted to go." She said she wouldn't have felt safe to return even on June 1, 2020—her requested return date—due to the pandemic. She couldn't put a date on when she would have felt safe to return due to the pandemic. As of her deposition on November 15, 2022, she said would not have felt safe to return to work. This foreclosed attendance for an inordinate amount of time.
Ms. Ivens cites a May 6, 2020 note from Dr. Cassady saying that Ms. Ivens "has a chronic medical problem (lupus) that puts her at higher risk of serious complications of COVID-19." She also cites a May 22, 2020 note from Dr. Mohr reporting that Ms. Ivens' lupus "is an autoimmune disease that requires her to be adamant about following safety precautions related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Please take this into consideration as it relates to her job." These notes do nothing but tie her ability to work to the pandemic.
A "medical leave spanning multiple months does not permit the employee to perform the essential functions of his job." Severson, 872 F.3d at 481. Since the pandemic started and throughout this litigation, Ms. Ivens says would not have felt safe to return to work—a [*14]  span of more than two years. Ms. Ivens may not have requested a two-year leave period to begin with; but, if she wouldn't have shown up to her job throughout the pandemic, she couldn't have performed the essential function of her job, rendering her unqualified and unable to bring an ADA accommodation claim on this record. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also Scheidler, 914 F.3d at 541.
Ms. Ivens also argues that there is evidence of bad faith from Growing Kids in her attempt to find a reasonable accommodation. But if she wasn't qualified because she wouldn't return to work until the pandemic subsided, then she wasn't entitled to an accommodation at all. The court must grant summary judgment for Growing Kids on Ms. Ivens' ADA accommodation claim.
CONCLUSION
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Growing Kids' summary judgment motion [ECF 40]. This order terminates the case.
SO ORDERED.
