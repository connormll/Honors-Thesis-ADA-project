Opinion



ORDER
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Incorporated Memorandum of Law (DE [46]). Defendant's Statement of Material Facts (DE [47]) was filed in conjunction with the instant motion (DE [46]). Plaintiff filed her Response in opposition (DE [60]) and her Response to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts (DE [61]), wherein Plaintiff does not dispute the facts contained in Defendant's Statement of Material Facts (DE [47]) with supporting evidence.1 Defendant has responded to these additional facts in its Reply Statement of Material Facts (DE [69]) and Reply Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (DE [70]). Accordingly, the matter is fully briefed and ripe for review.
Before moving to the history and analysis of this Motion (DE [46]), the Court must emphasize the importance of the local rules and trial [*2]  orders in this and every case. In the Order Setting Trial and Pre-Trial Schedule, Requiring Mediation, and Referring Certain Matters to Magistrate Judge (DE [14]) the Court carefully sets forth the procedure—with examples—for filing and responding to Motions for Summary Judgment. See also S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1.

I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On June 27, 2019, Plaintiff Debbie Delotta ("Plaintiff") duly filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). On September 11, 2019, the EEOC issued Plaintiff a Dismissal and Notice of Rights. Plaintiff timely filed a five-count Complaint (DE [1]) in this Court alleging Defendant South Broward Hospital District d/b/a Memorial Healthcare System ("Defendant") violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 ("FCRA"), and Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA").
First, Plaintiff alleges Defendant discriminated against her by withdrawing an accommodation of her work commute and failing to otherwise accommodate her disability. Second, Plaintiff alleges Defendant retaliated against her after she requested accommodation of her work commute and filed an "Inquiry Information" with the EEOC by (1) assigning her to support an additional director; (2) placing her on unpaid [*3]  leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"); (3) prohibiting her access to the employee online portal; and (4) denying requests to transfer retirement funds to herself. Finally, Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to send her a COBRA notice following her separation from employment.

II. BACKGROUND FACTS
Plaintiff was employed as an "Administrative Assistant" from April 2001 until approximately July 2019. She worked under the supervision of Defendant's Administrative Director of Regulatory Affairs, Barbara Bruce ("Ms. Bruce"). Plaintiff's job description included receiving and screening visitors and scheduling and coordinating meetings, answering telephone calls, handling general inquiries, maintaining filing systems, and ordering and stockpiling supplies. See (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 8); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 8) ("Undisputed."). Many of Plaintiff's job duties were required to be performed onsite, such as preparing agendas and policies-for-review for two regularly-scheduled, "very involved" monthly policy meetings, attending/running both monthly meetings and taking meeting minutes, maintaining original signed nursing policy books for the facility where she worked, ordering [*4]  supplies for the office or technology that was needed, making travel arrangements for her leaders, preparing PowerPoint presentations and Joint Commission presentations, assisting Ms. Bruce during Joint Commission inspections and surveys (which were unplanned visits and could occur "at any time"); and filing paper copies of changes to policies Ms. Bruce had worked on for ease of future reference. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 10) (internal citations omitted); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 10) ("Disputed.").
According to Ms. Bruce, Yira Winter-Perez ("Ms. Winter-Perez"), the Human Resources Director, and Margaret Hansen ("Ms. Hansen"), the Senior Vice President and Chief Nurse Executive, various functions of the position must be performed onsite and being onsite fulltime was an essential function of the job. See (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 9); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 9) ("Disputed."). No other administrative assistant was authorized to work from home during 2018 or 2019. See (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 11); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 11) ("Undisputed."). No other administrative assistant under Hansen's span of control regularly worked offsite, however, Plaintiff clarifies, without support, Ms. [*5]  Hansen's assistant was an Executive Assistant, which, she claims, was a different role and job description as Plaintiff's role and job description. See (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 12); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 12) ("Undisputed, subject to clarification.").
Plaintiff began suffering from migraines in 2018. (Compl. (DE [1]) at ¶ 13); see also (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 1). Plaintiff clarifies she was diagnosed by a board-certified neurologist for Defendant as having suffered from chronic migraines. (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 1); see also (Compl. (DE [1]) at ¶ 15). The migraines cause her "severe pain, distorted vision, dizziness, light sensitivity, and nausea on a daily basis," and she takes medication that makes her sedated and dizzy. (Compl. (DE [1]) at ¶¶ 16, 18); (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 2); see also (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 2) ("Undisputed."). "Driving a vehicle was Plaintiff's biggest trigger for migraine headaches and exacerbated the symptoms." (Compl. (DE [1]) at ¶¶ 17). Plaintiff cannot ride in vehicles as a passenger; therefore, using a ride service is not an option. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 4); see also (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 4) ("Undisputed.").
As a result, "Plaintiff [*6]  was forced to apply for an accommodation under the ADA." (Compl. (DE [1]) at ¶ 20). Defendant granted Plaintiff's accommodation under the ADA to work from home four (4) days per week and to work in the office one (1) day per week because Plaintiff needed to work offsite, control her schedule, and work when not symptomatic. (Compl. (DE [1]) ¶ at 21); see also (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 14); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 14) ("Undisputed."). The medical certifications submitted by Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Maike Blaya ("Dr. Blaya"), and her office confirmed Plaintiff's need to work from home because Plaintiff said she had problems driving. See (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 14); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 14) ("Undisputed, subject to clarification."). "Dr. Blaya's 3-29 and 4-22-19 FMLA certifications indicated Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of her job, whereas the ADA certifications indicated Plaintiff was able to perform the essential functions with reasonable accommodation." (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 15) (internal citations omitted); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 15) ("Disputed.").
On March 6, 2019, Plaintiff was called to appear for a meeting at the corporate offices [*7]  with Ms. Hansen. (Compl. (DE [1]) at ¶¶ 25-26). During this meeting, Plaintiff alleges Ms. Hansen advised her that no one else was permitted to work from home. Id. Plaintiff then reminded Ms. Hansen she was on approved work commute accommodation. On March 11, 2019, Plaintiff filed an Inquiry Information with the EEOC. Id. at ¶ 28.
In March 2019, Plaintiff said she could not work onsite to support three meetings per year for Anthony Gonzalez ("Mr. Gonzalez"), the Director of the Nurse Residency Program. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 17); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 17) ("Undisputed, subject to clarification."). Anticipating Plaintiff's return to onsite work, Ms. Hansen determined Plaintiff would assume support of Mr. Gonzalez from Ms. Hansen's administrative assistant, Kimberly Kulhanjian, who had supported Ms. Hansen and two other leaders over a number of years and had taken on support of Mr. Gonzalez since May 2018. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 20); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 20) ("Undisputed, subject to clarification."). Support for Mr. Gonzalez and Ms, Hansen would require Plaintiff be onsite three times per week at minimum. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 22); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 20) ("Disputed."). [*8]  Due to her chronic migraines, Plaintiff claimed she could not drive to provide onsite support three days per week. See (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 23); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 23). Defendant sent a letter to Dr. Blaya on April 8, 2019, to inform the physician that several essential functions of Plaintiff's administrative assistant position required onsite support (three times per week) and to ask Dr. Blaya to recommend accommodations, if any, which would allow Plaintiff to work onsite at least three times per week. Id.
Before Plaintiff made a formal request for accommodation, it is undisputed that Defendant accommodated Plaintiff by approving her requests to take intermittent FMLA leave for her migraine headaches beginning as early as August 2016. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 32); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 32) ("Undisputed."). When Plaintiff initially indicated she was experiencing migraines, Ms. Bruce allowed Plaintiff flexibility in performing the functions of her position, including allowing Plaintiff to rest in Ms. Bruce's office, permitting Plaintiff to leave work early/arrive later, and letting Plaintiff occasionally work from home. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 33); (Pl. Stat. (DE [*9]  [61]) at ¶ 33) ("Undisputed."). On July 25, 2018, Defendant also approved Plaintiff's request for intermittent FMLA leave from July 17, 2018, to January 17, 2019, and later extended it from January 18 to February 28, 2019, related to her migraines. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 34); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 34) ("Undisputed.").
Plaintiff was not able to work onsite without gagging and vomiting frequently throughout the workday. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 24); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 24) ("Undisputed."). As a result, Plaintiff requested an accommodation of her commute to work, which Defendant approved for a three-month period on August 29, 2018, in accordance with Plaintiff's requests and her physician's medical certifications. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 26-28); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶¶ 26-28) ("Undisputed."). In late November 2018, Defendant approved extension of the accommodation until February 28, 2019, and continued accommodating Plaintiff until May 13, 2019, when Plaintiff declined to provide further information from her physician. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 28-29); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 28) ("Undisputed."); but see (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 29) ("Disputed, in part."). After [*10]  which, Defendant placed Plaintiff on a continuous FMLA leave from May 13, 2019, to July 27, 2019, and paid her health benefits during that time. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 43); but see (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 43) ("Undisputed, with clarification necessary.").
During Plaintiff's formal accommodation, Plaintiff would clock in and out for work depending on if she felt ill and for other personal circumstances.2 Also during the period of accommodation, when Plaintiff had been unable to provide certain onsite duties for Ms. Bruce, Ms. Bruce covered those duties herself or made alternative arrangements for completion of the duties. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 51); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 51) ("Disputed."). Ultimately, however, "[t]he accommodation Plaintiff sought was an accommodation of her commute." (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 26); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 26) ("Undisputed.").
In early March 2019, Defendant continued engaging in the interactive process with Plaintiff after the expiration of the extension to her commute accommodation, provided Plaintiff with new ADA and FMLA medical certifications for her medical provider, and allowed Plaintiff additional time to submit documentation from [*11]  her physician to allow Defendant to determine Plaintiff's need for continued accommodation. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 37-38); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶¶ 37-38) ("Disputed, in part."). During this process, Defendant (1) approved Plaintiff's request for intermittent FMLA leave (retroactively from February 28 through March 12, 2019, and from March 29 through July 16, 2019); (2) allowed Plaintiff to continue working under her work commute accommodation until May 13, 2019; and (3) did not require Plaintiff to provide any administrative support to Mr. Gonzalez. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 39); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 39) ("Disputed.").
In her Complaint (DE [1]), Plaintiff alleges Defendant began retaliating against her after she filed an Inquiry Information with the EEOC on March 11, 2019. (Compl. (DE [1]) at ¶¶ 28-30). Plaintiff, however, does not know if Defendant received a copy of her Inquiry Information. See (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 45); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 45). Nonetheless, she insists such retaliation included: (1) Defendant locking Plaintiff's access to the employee online portal; (2) refusal to permit Plaintiff to transfer her 401(k) savings account without any reason [*12]  provided despite requests for same from Plaintiff; (3) intentionally reassigning Plaintiff to a new position that required additional driving and more time in the office contrary to Plaintiff's ADA accommodation; and (4) advising that Plaintiff was being placed on involuntary and uncertified unpaid leave under the FMLA despite Plaintiff fully able to perform the duties of her position under Ms. Bruce. Id. at ¶ 31.
By early May 2019, Defendant had not received a response from Dr. Blaya in support of extending the accommodation. Plaintiff claims, without support, that Dr. Blaya was questioning the ongoing need recertifications when Plaintiff's condition had already been deemed a chronic one. See (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 40-41); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶¶ 40-41) ("Undisputed, with clarification necessary."). Defendant informed Plaintiff the request to extend her work commute accommodation had been denied on May 10, 2019. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 42); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 42) ("Undisputed."). At the same time, Defendant placed Plaintiff on continuous unpaid FMLA leave from May 13, 2019, to July 27, 2019. Plaintiff's FMLA leave expired on July 27, 2019, and Plaintiff resigned in [*13]  lieu of returning to work without further accommodation or continuing the interactive process to approve an extension of her work commute accomodation. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 43-44); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶¶ 43-44) ("Undisputed, with clarification necessary.").
On May 29, 2019, Plaintiff requested a partial withdrawal of funds from her pension plan, however, she was ineligible for a withdrawal of pension plan funds because she was on continuous FMLA leave at the time. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 55-57); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶¶ 55-57). On July 6, 2019, Plaintiff requested disbursement of the funds in her VALIC accounts due to disability and hardship, however, Plaintiff could only access the funds she had contributed to the accounts, not the employer match funds, because she was still an employee as of July 6, 2019. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 58-59); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶¶ 58-59) ("Undisputed"). On July 8, 2019, Edward Werner ("Mr. Werner"), the Administrative Director of Human Resources, processed Plaintiff's request; per IRS rules for hardship distribution, Plaintiff's distribution was limited to the amount contained in the supporting documentation Plaintiff provided [*14]  in her eviction notice, an amount equal to $1,794.48. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 60); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 60) ("Undisputed"). On July 31, 2019, following Plaintiff's resignation, Mr. Werner processed Plaintiff's request for disbursement of the funds in her VALIC accounts, which reflected that Plaintiff had forfeited funds in her account based upon the vesting requirement in effect at the time Plaintiff resigned employment. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 61-62); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶¶ 61-62) ("Undisputed"). On August 21, 2019, Defendant through P&A Administrative Services, Inc. ("P&A") sent a COBRA election notice ("COBRA Notice") by first class mail to Plaintiff's last known address. Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 64-73); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶¶ 64-73) ("Plaintiff is without knowledge, however, Plaintiff never received a COBRA notice to her mailing address.").
Plaintiff seemingly disputes Defendant's Statement of Material Facts (DE [47]) facts; however, she cites no record evidence refuting them.3 Likewise, Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts (DE [61]) does not provide evidentiary citations supporting Plaintiff's position as required by Local Rule 56.1(b)(2)(C). See (Pl.'s [*15]  Resp. (DE [34]) at ¶¶ 2-29). The Court will not expend valuable judicial resources searching for resolution of such purported factual disputes.4 See S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(a)(2) ("An opponent's Statement of Material Facts shall clearly challenge any purportedly material fact asserted by the movant that the opponent contends is genuinely in dispute.") (emphasis added). Plaintiff's contentions that the material facts asserted in Defendant's Statement of Material Facts (DE [47]) are disputed either did not: cite to particular parts of materials in the record; show that the materials cited by Defendant do not establish the absence of a genuine dispute; clearly challenge the material fact asserted by Defendant; or controvert the material fact asserted by Defendant. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A), (B); S. D. Fla. L. R. 56.1(a)(2), (c); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) ("If a party fails to properly . . . address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may . . . consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion . . . .").

III. LEGAL STANDARD
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), summary judgment "is appropriate only if 'the movant shows that there is no genuine [dispute] as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'" Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 656-57, 134 S. Ct. 1861, 188 L. Ed. 2d 895 (2014) (per curiam) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a));5 see also Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330, 344, 130 S. Ct. 2295, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1070 (2010). "By [*16]  its very terms, this standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue is "genuine" if a reasonable trier of fact, viewing all the record evidence, could rationally find in favor of the nonmoving party in light of his burden of proof. Harrison v. Culliver, 746 F.3d 1288, 1298 (11th Cir. 2014). And a fact is "material" if, "under the applicable substantive law, it might affect the outcome of the case." Hickson Corp. v. N. Crossarm Co., 357 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2004). "[W]here the material facts are undisputed and do not support a reasonable inference in favor of the non-movant, summary judgment may properly be granted as a matter of law." DA Realty Holdings, LLC v. Tenn. Land Consultants, 631 Fed. Appx. 817, 820 (11th Cir. 2015).
The Court must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. SEC v. Monterosso, 756 F.3d 1326, 1333 (11th Cir. 2014). However, to prevail on a motion for summary judgment, "the nonmoving party must offer more than a mere scintilla of evidence for its position; indeed, the nonmoving party must make a showing sufficient to permit the jury to reasonably find on its behalf." Urquilla-Diaz v. Kaplan Univ., 780 F.3d 1039, 1050 (11th Cir. 2015). "[T]his, however, does not mean that we are constrained to accept all [*17]  the nonmovant's factual characterizations and legal arguments." Beal v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 20 F.3d 454, 459 (11th Cir. 1994).

IV. DISCUSSION
In the instant motion (DE [46]), Defendant argues it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff cannot prove her case. First, Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot prove Defendant discriminated against her based on a disability because Plaintiff was not "substantially limited in a major life activity" and was not a "qualified individual." Defendant contends Plaintiff's inability to drive is not a "major life activity," however, her inability to perform onsite duties as required of her position as an administrative assistant, rendered her unqualified for the position. Second, Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot prove it discriminated against her by failing to accommodate because it had no legal obligation to do so but did provide accommodation anyway. Third, Defendant insists Plaintiff cannot prove her retaliation claims because she did not engage in statutorily-protected activity as her request to accommodate her commute was not objectively reasonable. Defendant provided Plaintiff FMLA leave as an additional accommodation when she said she could not work onsite three days per week and her extended accommodation [*18]  expired.
Additionally, Defendant argues it suspended Plaintiff's employee portal (VPN) access in accordance with protocol and processed Plaintiff's requests for transfers/distributions from her retirement accounts in accordance with protocol. Finally, Defendant contends Plaintiff cannot establish Defendant violated COBRA's notice requirements because the undisputed record shows Defendant timely sent Plaintiff her COBRA Notice by measures reasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt. There is no evidence to suggest otherwise despite Plaintiff's claims to the contrary.6 Furthermore, Plaintiff's subjective allegations and mere speculation is insufficient to defeat summary judgment. See Glasscox v. City of Argo, 903 F.3d 1207, 1213 (11th Cir. 2018) ("Conclusory allegations and speculation are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact."). Accordingly, this Court grants Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Incorporated Memorandum of Law (DE [46]) as follows:

A. Counts I and III — Disability Discrimination Under the ADA and the FCRA
Counts I and III of the Complaint (DE [1]) allege disability discrimination in violation of the FCRA and ADA. Under the ADA, an employer is prohibited from discriminating against "a qualified individual [*19]  on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The FCRA also protects employees from discrimination based on disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir. 2014) (noting that FCRA disability discrimination claims are analyzed under the same framework as ADA claims). Florida courts have construed the FCRA in conformity with the ADA. See Wimberly v. Sec. Tech. Grp., Inc., 866 So.2d 146, 147 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004). In the absence of direct evidence, a plaintiff can prove discrimination and retaliation claims under ADA through circumstantial evidence by utilizing the archetypal, three-step, burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See E.E.O.C. v. Joe's Stone Crabs, Inc., 296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir. 2002).
"An employee making a discrimination claim under the ADA must first exhaust her administrative remedies by filing a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC." Batson v. Salvation Army, 897 F.3d 1320, 1327 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing Maynard v. Pneumatic Prods. Corp., 256 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir. 2001)). "The purpose of this requirement is to allow the EEOC the 'first opportunity to investigate the alleged discriminatory practices [and] perform its role in obtaining voluntary compliance and promoting conciliation efforts.'" Id. (quoting Gregory v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., 355 F.3d 1277, 1279 (11th Cir. 2004) (explaining exhaustion in the Title VII context). "With this purpose in mind, '[the Eleventh [*20]  Circuit] . . . has noted that judicial claims are allowed if they amplify, clarify, or more clearly focus the allegations in the EEOC complaint, but has cautioned that allegations of new acts of discrimination are inappropriate.'" Id. (quoting Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1279-80). "To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that at the time of the adverse employment action, she (1) had a disability, (2) was a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability." Batson, 897 F.3d at 1326 (citing Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007)).

1) Disability
The ADA defines "disability" as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102 (2); Carruthers, 357 F.3d at 1215 (11th Cir. 2004). For any ADA claim to succeed, the claimant must show that her condition of impairment rises to the level of a disability. Id. Disability requires a substantial limitation of one or more major life activities. Id. at 1216. Major life activities include: "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, [*21]  concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." Id.; 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A); Wood v. Gilman Bldg. Prods., 769 Fed. Appx. 796, 800 (11th Cir. 2019). An employee must establish that she had a disability or was regarded as having a disability at the time of the adverse employment action about which she is complaining. Id.
Here, Plaintiff suffers from chronic migraine headaches, which cause "severe pain, distorted vision, dizziness, light sensitivity, and nausea on a daily basis," and she takes medication that makes her sedated and dizzy. (Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 1-2); (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶¶ 1-2) ("Undisputed"). Plaintiff's diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment have detrimentally affected her ability to drive a vehicle or even ride as a passenger. The record shows, Plaintiff based all of her requests for accommodation on her inability to drive to work and Defendant provided Plaintiff a work commute accommodation and a subsequent extension. The Eleventh Circuit, however, has held that driving is not a major life activity for purposes of the ADA. See Chenoweth v. Hillsborough Cnty., 250 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir. 2001) (noting that, while the enumeration of major life activities in the EEOC regulations is not exhaustive, "driving is not only absent from the list but is conspicuously different in character from the activities that are listed"). [*22] 
Plaintiff's case, then, depends on the argument that her inability to drive substantially limited her ability to work. See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 492, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999) (working assumed to be major life activity). Plaintiff produced no evidence that she was, in fact, unable to perform her job. The record supports only a limitation on Plaintiff's ability to travel by car. In response (DE [60]) to Defendant's argument, Plaintiff now purports to suffer from a litany of limitations on various life activities. Plaintiff now asserts she is substantially limited as compared to the average person in the general population in her ability to socially interact with others, care for herself, perform manual tasks, see, hear, speak, learn, read, concentrate, think, and communicate. See (Resp. (DE [60]) at 6-7). These purported limitations necessarily render Plaintiff unable to perform the essential functions of the administrative assistant position notwithstanding the twice weekly onsite travel requirements of supporting Ms. Bruce or Mr. Gonzalez.

2) Qualified Individual
A "qualified individual" is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual [*23]  holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000)). An individual must show either that she can perform the essential function of her job without accommodation, or failing that, show that she can perform the essential functions of her job with a reasonable accommodation. See Davis v, 205 F.3d at 1305 (citing Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997). "An individual who cannot perform the essential job functions, even with accommodation, is not qualified and therefore not covered under the ADA." Perry v. City of Avon Park, 662 Fed. Appx. 831, 834 (11th Cir. 2016) (citing D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1229); see also id.
Thus, if Plaintiff is unable to perform an essential function of her administrative assistant position, even with an accommodation, she is, by definition, not a "qualified individual" and, therefore, not covered under the ADA. Davis v, 205 F.3d at 1305. (citing Cramer v. Fla., 117 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir. 1997)). The ADA does not require Defendant to eliminate an essential function of Plaintiff's job. Id. Therefore, the issue narrows to whether onsite work is an essential function of Plaintiff's administrative assistant position.
"[E]ssential functions" of a position are "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1). The Court may consider the following evidence to determine whether a particular function is essential: (1) "[t]he employer's judgment as to which functions [*24]  are essential;" (2) "[w]ritten job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job;" (3) "[t]he amount of time spent on the job performing the function;" (4) "[t]he consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function;" (5) "[t]he terms of a collective bargaining agreement;" (6) "[t]he work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or" (7) "[t]he current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)(i)-(vii); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) ("[C]onsideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description . . . for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job."). "Determining whether a particular job duty is an essential function involves a factual inquiry to be conducted on a case-by-case basis." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2001). And although an employer's view is accorded weight, it cannot be conclusive. See Holly, 492 F.3d at 1258.
Plaintiff opposes Defendant's reliance on Plaintiff's job description in support of the instant motion (DE [46]) and argues her "actual job duties were such that being onsite was never necessary to perform the essential and regular job duties and [*25]  responsibilities fully and successfully." (Resp. (DE [60]) at 10) (citing (Pl. Aff. (DE [45-1]) Ex. A). The record, however, demonstrates Plaintiff was not qualified for the position of administrative assistant because she could not provide onsite support three times per week. Plaintiff insists she was unable to drive or be driven due to her condition, Defendant's accommodation permitted Plaintiff to work remotely, however, the record indicates certain essential job functions required of the administrative assistant position were subsumed by Ms. Bruce. Accordingly, even if Plaintiff had provided medical certifications in order to further extend the work commute accommodation, and even if this Court were to consider the litany of new, contradictory, and unsupported limitations, Defendant would have been required to eliminate essential functions of Plaintiff's job to further accommodate her remotely.

3) Unlawful Discrimination
"One way a plaintiff may establish the third prong is by showing that her employer failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability." Batson, 897 F.3d at 1326 (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262). "The ADA requires an employer to accommodate an employee with a known disability unless the accommodation [*26]  would result in undue hardship to the employer." Id. (citing Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000)). "An accommodation can qualify as 'reasonable,' and thus be required by the ADA, only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas v. W. W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing LaChance v. Duffy's Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1998)). "The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job's essential functions." Id. at 1255-56 (citing Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997); Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 283 (11th Cir. 1997)). A plaintiff, however, is not entitled to the accommodation of his or her choice but is entitled only to a reasonable accommodation. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286.
Here, Plaintiff alleges Defendant discriminated against her when it purportedly withdrew its accommodation of her work commute and purportedly failed to offer a proper alternative. (Compl. (DE [1]) at ¶ 39). Defendant, however, did not withdraw Plaintiff's work commute accommodation; it expired. Plaintiff does not dispute Defendant accommodated her formally and informally for years. The issue here is Plaintiff's dissatisfaction with Defendant's last accommodation: FMLA leave. Defendant, undisputedly approved accommodation of Plaintiff's work commute for over eight months. In March of 2019, however, Plaintiff refused to proffer clarification from [*27]  her physician regarding her ability to perform essential functions. Nonetheless, Defendant extended Plaintiff's work commute accommodation twice. Finally, despite Plaintiff's condition being chronic, Plaintiff fails to acknowledge or counter her physician's certifications requesting ADA accommodation for fixed periods of time.

B. Count II and IV — Disability Retaliation and Under the FCRA
The FCRA provides that an employer cannot "discriminate against any person because that person has opposed" an unlawful employment practice or made a charge under the FCRA." Fla. Stat. § 760.10(7). "As with disability discrimination claims, retaliation claims brought under the FCRA are analyzed under the ADA framework." Monroe v. Fla. Dep't of Corr., 793 Fed. Appx. 924, 928 (11th Cir. 2019) (citing Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016). The ADA, in turn, provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a charge . . . under [the ADA]." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a).
"The burden-shifting analysis applicable to ADA discrimination claims is applicable to ADA retaliation claims." Monroe, 793 Fed. Appx. at 928 (citing Batson, 897 F.3d at 1328-29; see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under either act, an employee must demonstrate (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected [*28]  conduct, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that a causal connection exists between the two." Batson, 897 F.3d at 1329 (citing Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1297 (11th Cir. 2006). Protected activity encompasses requests for accommodation. See Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258 (stating a request for reasonable accommodation can satisfy the first element for an ADA retaliation claim). The employee "must have had a good faith, reasonable belief that [her] activity was protected by the statute." Monroe, 793 Fed. Appx. at 928 (citing Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998)).
First, Defendant argues Plaintiff's request was not reasonable. Plaintiff fails to address this argument in her response (DE [60]). Next, Defendant argues Plaintiff has not proffered evidence to support her claim that she suffered an adverse employment action that she would not have suffered "but for" having made a request for accommodation. In response (DE [60]), Plaintiff appears to suggest she complained to the EEOC and filed her Inquiry Information before her meeting on March 6, 2019, and as a result Defendant retaliated by assigning her to support Mr. Gonzalez in addition to Ms. Bruce. The record evidence, including Plaintiff's Affidavit (DE [60-1]), however, indicate Plaintiff had not filed her Inquiry Information with the EEOC until March 11, 2019. Furthermore, [*29]  undisputed record evidence indicates Ms. Winter-Perez and Ms. Bruce made the decision to have Plaintiff support Mr. Gonzalez in February 2019. Nonetheless, Plaintiff's unsupported allegation that being assigned to Mr. Gonzalez and Ms. Bruce constituted an adverse employment is insufficient to make a claim for retaliation.

C. Count V — COBRA
"COBRA provides that employers must allow former employees the opportunity to continue healthcare coverage under the employer's plan if a qualifying event occurs." Debene v. BayCare Health Sys., 688 Fed. Appx. 831, 838 (11th Cir. 2017) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 1161). "Under COBRA, an employer—through its healthcare administrator—must notify an employee of his right to continue his healthcare coverage after the termination of his employment." Id. at 839 (citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 1163(2), 1166). "The employer must notify its healthcare administrator of the employee's termination within 30 days." Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 1166(a)(2)). Then, "the administrator then must notify the employee of his continuation right within 14 days. Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 1166(a)(4)(A), (c)). "If an employer fails to provide a terminated employee notice of his COBRA rights, the employee may file a civil action to enforce his rights." Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)).
"Notice must be provided in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Secretary." Debene, 688 Fed. Appx. at 839 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 1166(a)). [*30]  "Pursuant to those regulations, the plan administrator 'shall use measures reasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt of the material by plan participants.'" Id. (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 2520.104b-1(b)(1)). "The regulations specify that sending notice by first-class mail is sufficient to meet this requirement." Id. (emphasis added).
Here, Defendant argues the undisputed record evidence demonstrates it sent P&A Administrative Services ("P&A") electronic files on August 16, 2019, which named Plaintiff as a participant who had experienced a qualifying event. See Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 71); but see (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 71) ("Plaintiff is without knowledge, however, Plaintiff never received a COBRA notice to her mailing address."). P&A then generated and sent Plaintiff her COBRA continuation coverage election notice to the last address Plaintiff had provided to Defendant. See Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶ 72); but see (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶ 72) ("Plaintiff is without knowledge, however, Plaintiff never received a COBRA notice to her mailing address."). The notice was sent to Plaintiff via first-class mail on August 21, 2019. See Def. Stat. (DE [47]) at ¶¶ 67-73); but see (Pl. Stat. (DE [61]) at ¶¶ 67-73) ("Plaintiff [*31]  is without knowledge, however, Plaintiff never received a COBRA notice to her mailing address.").
Plaintiff presented no evidence or argument to dispute Defendant complied with its duty under COBRA and was not entitled to summary judgment on Count V of the Complaint (DE [1]). Citing nothing, Plaintiff merely claims a jury can reasonably find that Defendant violated Plaintiff's COBRA Notice rights. Notwithstanding this unsupported claim, Plaintiff admits she always had her correct mailing address on file. The Eleventh Circuit has held that a party's failure to respond to an argument in a motion for summary judgment can constitute an abandonment of the underlying claim. See e.g., Jones v. Bank of Am., N.A., 564 Fed. Appx. 432, 434 (11th Cir. 2014); Fischer v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 349 Fed. Appx. 372, 375 n.2 (11th Cir. 2009); Floyd v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 274 Fed. Appx. 763, 764-65 (11th Cir. 2008). Where a plaintiff fails to respond to an argument in a motion for summary judgment, she waives the argument. Mitchell v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 448 Fed. Appx. 911, 914 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing Transamerica Leasing, Inc. v. Inst. of London Underwriters, 267 F.3d 1303, 1308 n.1 (11th Cir. 2001)). Accordingly, summary judgment on Counts VI and VII for Defendants is appropriate. Edmondson v. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala., 258 Fed. Appx. 250, 253 (11th Cir. 2007) ("In opposing a motion for summary judgment, a party may not rely on her pleadings to avoid judgment against her. There is no burden upon the district court to distill every potential argument that could be made based upon the materials before it on summary judgment. Rather, the onus is upon the parties [*32]  to formulate arguments; grounds alleged in the complaint but not relied upon in summary judgment are deemed abandoned."). Therefore, summary judgment must be entered against Plaintiff.
Accordingly, it is hereby
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (DE [46]) is GRANTED. In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58, judgment will be entered separately. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE this case and DENY AS MOOT any pending motions. Furthermore, all deadlines are TERMINATED, and all hearings are CANCELLED.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this 25th day of February 2022.
