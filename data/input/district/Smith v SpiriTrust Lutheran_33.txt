REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. Introduction
This case comes before us in a procedural posture which highlights the value of further clarity concerning claims and defenses. The plaintiff has filed a complaint, which alleges various claims of workplace discrimination, albeit in a somewhat spare fashion. The defendants, in turn, have filed motions to dismiss, or in the alternative for summary judgment, which challenge the legal sufficiency of Smith's complaint but also invite us to foray beyond the pleadings. Specifically, the defendants allege based upon what they purport to be the undisputed facts of the case, that Smith's claims fail as a matter of law and they are entitled to summary judgment [*2]  in their favor. These motions, filed at the outset of this litigation, have inspired a response by Smith, in which she alleges some new factual matters that are not squarely set forth in her complaint while decrying summary judgment as premature, where the plaintiff has not yet been able to conduct discovery to develop her claims in a more fulsome way.
Upon review, we conclude that a number of Smith's legal claims fail as pleaded, but that Smith should have the opportunity to further amend her complaint to provide a more definite statement of her claims. We also submit that to the extent we are invited to consider resolution of this case on summary judgment, those motions should be denied or deferred pending the receipt of a more definite statement of Smith's claims and some measure of factual discovery to reconcile the disparate narrative threads presented by the parties.
Pending before the court are the defendants' motions to dismiss, and, in the alternative, for summary judgment, in a contentious employment dispute case between the former employee and current plaintiff, Alicia Smith, an African-American woman, and her former employers and supervisors. (Docs. 6, 18). Smith brought [*3]  the instant suit against her former employers, SpiriTrust Lutheran ("SpiriTrust") and Cura Hospitality ("Cura"), and supervisors, Michelle Loucks and Kevin Scritchfield, alleging violations of her rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1981; 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000(e), et seq.; and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12111, et seq. Smith contends that during her employment, the defendants discriminated against her because of her race and created a work environment that was openly and actively hostile to her, which the defendants failed to remediate. Smith also asserts that the defendants ultimately retaliated against her for complaining about this unfavorable treatment in violation of Title VII. Smith further claims that the defendants discriminated against her because of her alleged disability and retaliated against her in violation of the ADA.
The defendants dispute these claims, arguing initially that Smith has failed to sufficiently plead the elements of any of her claims in order to proceed with this lawsuit. In other words, the defendants posit that Smith's complaint merely illustrates that there were interpersonal disagreements between Smith and her coworkers, but that these disputes were [*4]  wholly unrelated to Smith's race or disability. In addition, Defendant Cura asserts that Smith has failed to allege enough facts to establish an employment relationship necessary to hold it liable for any of the claims in this case.
Thus, in its current form, these motions raise legal challenges to the sufficiency of Smith's complaint, coupled with an invitation to find that the undisputed facts only permit of a judgment in favor of the defendants. Smith's rejoinder to these two legal claims consists of an assertion that she has averred sufficient facts to support all of her claims, combined with an affidavit which detailed some new facts not fully articulated in the complaint, and an argument that summary judgment would be premature where there are disparate claims concerning the underlying facts.
After review of the record, we agree with the defendants that in some respects Smith has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a number of her claims in this case. We will accordingly recommend that the defendants' motions to dismiss be granted, in part. However, we will further recommend that the plaintiff be given leave to amend her complaint to attempt to remedy the deficiencies [*5]  identified in this report and recommendation. Furthermore, given the necessity for amendment of these pleadings, and the sharply contrasting factual narratives that the parties present in their pleadings, we recommend that the court defer addressing this case on summary judgment and deny any summary judgment motion without prejudice.

II. Statement of Facts and of the Case 1
Alicia Smith was hired by SpiriTrust Lutheran to work as a Dining Services Assistant at The Village at Shrewsbury, a retirement living community, in April of 2019. (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 9, 13). As part of this position, Smith worked within the kitchen department, which was overseen by Cura Hospitality, a subcontractor tasked with providing meal services for SpiriTrust. (Id., ¶ 15). Defendant Scritchfield, an employee of Cura, oversaw the kitchen department, and was Smith's direct supervisor for the duration of her employment with SpiriTrust. (Id., ¶ 17). In addition, Smith was overseen by Michelle Loucks, the Assistant Executive Director of The Village at Shrewsbury. (Id., ¶ 16). As part of her employment, Smith was responsible for transporting food carts, serving meals to residents, clearing tables, and stocking supplies. ( [*6] Id., ¶ 20).
Smith alleges that shortly after her employment with SpiriTrust began, she began experiencing differential treatment from her co-workers, which she claims was due to her race. (Id., ¶ 21). In her complaint, Smith describes what she characterizes as an ongoing pattern of discrimination, exemplified by a number of specific incidents. The first of these instances allegedly took place on or about May 31, 2019 while Smith was serving residents in the dining room. (Id., ¶ 22). As part of Smith's serving duties, she was frequently required to go back and forth between the dining room and the kitchen. (Id.) When she entered the kitchen, Smith claims that a co-worker, Bree McCraven, blocked Smith's entrance with her body and a food cart and instructed Smith to "go the long way through the dishwashing area to get to the refrigerator." (Id.) Smith apparently complied, but indicated that she would discuss the matter with Scritchfield. (Id., ¶ 26). Since Smith states that Scritchfield was not there at the time, Dana Chester, a cook and Scritchfield's surrogate, allegedly came to McCraven's aid, dismissing Smith's concerns. (Id., ¶ 28). Smith claims that later in her shift, McCraven purposely [*7]  bumped against her as McCraven walked past through the kitchen. (Id., ¶ 29).
Smith details the second incident, which she alleges occurred around June 2, 2019, in which another co-worker, Todd Bond, used a highly offensive racial epithet and told Smith to "Shut up [epithet]." (Id., ¶ 30). According to Smith, this racist slur was part of a broader pattern of abuse and Bond "often yelled at [her] and accused her of making mistakes." (Id., ¶ 31). After complaining to Scritchfield about McCraven, Chester, and Bond, and informing Scritchfield that she had suffered a stroke and felt vulnerable due to an inability to defend herself against these coworkers, Smith claims that nothing was done. (Id., ¶ 33). Specifically, Smith alleges that Scritchfield dismissed her complaints regarding Bond, stating that she should go easy on him due to his disability. (Id., ¶¶ 35-36). In addition, Smith asserts that Scritchfield merely told her that he would need to conduct an investigation into her co-workers' conduct, but she claims that weeks went by without hearing anything regarding this investigation. (Id., ¶ 36). Smith has also submitted a declaration which avers factual details beyond those set forth [*8]  in the pleadings, alleging in some greater detail that Scritchfield defended Bond when Smith attempted to confront him regarding his use of racist slurs. (Doc. 9-1).
Smith claims that a third incident took place around June 24, 2019, when she was clearing dishes from the dining room and residents' rooms. (Id., ¶ 39). Midway through this process, Chester allegedly began screaming at Smith, demanding to know where Smith had been and berating her for not assisting a co-worker with cleaning the dishes in the kitchen. (Id., ¶¶ 39-41). Smith then asserts that Chester took the remaining kitchen employees into a separate room and closed the door behind them so that Smith was the only one left in the kitchen. (Id., ¶ 42). After reporting this incident to Scritchfield, Smith claims that she was told he would need to conduct another investigation. (Id., ¶ 44). When Smith pressed Scritchfield about the results of the prior investigations, she was told that Scritchfield had found no foul play and the investigations had terminated without any disciplinary action taken against Smith's co-workers. (Id., ¶ 46). In contrast, Smith was issued a final warning by Loucks in response to the June 24 incident [*9]  since Smith had raised her middle finger at Chester during their altercation.2 (Id., ¶ 45).
A few days after this June 24 incident, Smith claims that she tripped over a box that had been left on the floor of the kitchen during her shift which caused her to fall to the floor on her left side and require a visit to the emergency room for treatment for a contusion and sprained mid-back and neck. (Id., ¶¶ 47-48). Upon her return to work, Smith alleges that her co-workers' harassment continued. (Id., ¶ 49). For instance, Smith claims that when she would enter the building, Loucks and others would surround her and follow her to the kitchen while asking questions.3 In addition, Smith asserts that on another occasion, a manager, Cathy Fanus, "purposely hit Plaintiff in her injured shoulder [with her fist], knowing of Plaintiff's injury." (Id., ¶ 51).
Around July 15, 2019, Smith claims that Scritchfield informed her that she was being reassigned to a new position cleaning and disinfecting wheelchairs.4 (Id., ¶ 54). Scritchfield requested that Smith sign paperwork memorializing this new work assignment, but Smith claims that she needed more time to review the documents before she would be able to [*10]  sign them.5 Rather than give her time to review the documents, Smith asserts that Scritchfield refused to give her more time, going so far as to wave the paperwork in front of her face and ask "What[, ] can't you read?," and insisting that if she would not sign it, then she would need to clock out and go home for the day. (Id., ¶¶ 57-58). Smith claims that she told SpiriTrust's Human Resources Director, Sara Sprenkle, about her interaction with Scritchfield, but that nothing was ever done to remediate the situation. (Id., ¶ 60).
Finally, Smith complains that the defendants would remove her from the work schedule and then reschedule her for work, allegedly without telling her, so that she would fail to show up for work as assigned. (Id., ¶ 61). In addition, she asserts that the defendants would consistently cut back her work hours despite the fact that the defendants were short-staffed. (Id., ¶ 62). It appears that, on August 6, 2019, Smith resigned from her position at SpiriTrust, a decision which Smith claims was brought about by such intolerable work conditions that she was constructively discharged. (Id., ¶ 64).
According to the defendants, Smith was hired by SpiriTrust on a part-time [*11]  basis, working 24-30 hours biweekly. (Doc. 6-1, ¶ 6). At the time she was hired, the defendants assert that Smith did not inform SpiriTrust that she had suffered a prior brain injury which could impair her ability to perform her job duties. (Id., ¶ 11). As part of her job duties, Smith was required to frequently lift items weighing up to 20 pounds, frequently carry items weighing up to 10 pounds, and frequently push carts weighing up to 30 pounds. (Id., ¶ 9). Due to her workplace injury on June 26, 2019, Smith became unable to perform many of these physical requirements of her job since she was given 5-pound lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling restrictions and could not reach overhead. (Id., ¶¶ 45, 51). A follow-up visit with Smith's treating physician on July 9, 2019 revealed that Smith had injured her left shoulder and cervical spine, so her work restrictions were modified to a 2-pound limitation on lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling. (Id., ¶¶ 60-61).
These restrictions prohibited Smith from performing her normal duties as assigned, so the defendants claim that they initially modified her job duties on July 12, 2019, but it was soon discovered that these modifications were [*12]  insufficient to account for Smith's limitations, and she needed to be reassigned to a temporary new position cleaning wheelchairs, railings, and doorknobs to ensure compliance with her 2-pound lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling restriction. (Id., ¶¶ 65-69). On July 15, 2019, Smith met with Scritchfield and a Human Resources staff member to review the transitional job duties that she would be performing to comply with her 2-pound restrictions. (Id., ¶ 70). Since Smith was unable to return to her original duties as a Dining Services Assistant because she would exceed her physical limitations, she would either need to sign the paperwork memorializing her new, temporary work assignment or leave for the day. Smith chose to leave to give herself more time to review the paperwork. (Id., ¶ 71).
The defendants also provide some additional detail regarding Smith's assertion that she was arbitrarily added and removed from the work schedule. On this score, the defendants assert that an email exchange occurred between Sprenkle and Smith in which Smith told Sprenkle that her shift had been crossed off of the schedule on July 24, 2019. (Id., ¶ 78; Ex. 23, at 4). Sprenkle apparently told Smith [*13]  that her shift had accidentally been crossed off for a co-worker's vacation time, and that Smith was still scheduled to work that day. (Id.; Ex. 23, at 3). According to this email exchange, Smith concluded the email chain by stating that "the culture of SpiriTrust Lutheran is causing me depression, anxiety and stress. Please handle all matters with my Lawyer." (Id.; Ex. 23, at 4).
Finally, the defendants note that Smith never provided them with documentation supporting her brain injury and alleged stroke aside from an August 28, 2018 letter from a Quincy Harberger, M.D. addressed to Millersville University, indicating that the effects of Smith's stroke require her to have access to audiotext books. (Id., at ¶¶ 80-83; Ex. 25). However, they claim that no other documentation was provided from a treating physician. (Id., ¶¶ 81-82).
On the basis of these facts, Smith filed the instant complaint, setting forth claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1981; 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3); Title VII; and the ADA, and naming SpiriTrust Lutheran, Cura Hospitality, Michelle Loucks and Kevin Scritchfield as defendants. (Doc. 1). Smith contends that during her employment, the defendants discriminated against her because of her race, creating a work environment [*14]  that was hostile to her which the defendants failed to remediate. Smith also argues that the defendants ultimately retaliated against her for complaining about this unfavorable treatment in violation of Title VII. Smith further asserts that the defendants discriminated against her because of her alleged disability and retaliated against her in violation of the ADA.
With the claims framed in this fashion, we recommend as follows: First, Smith's Title VII and ADA claims should be dismissed as to the individual defendants, Loucks and Scritchfield. In addition, Smith's Title VII and § 1981 claims should be dismissed as to defendant Cura Hospitality. Likewise, as currently pleaded, Smith's ADA claims fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and should be dismissed. Further, Smith's § 1985(3) conspiracy claim is legally insufficient as it is currently pleaded. However, the court should also allow Smith leave to amend and provide a more definite statement of her claims. Further, pending the filing of any amended complaint, and potentially discovery aimed at reconciling the parties' competing factual narratives, the court should defer and deny and summary judgment motions without prejudice to [*15]  renewal of those emotions on a more fulsome factual record.

III. Discussion

A. Motion to Dismiss — Standard of Review
A motion to dismiss tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint. It is proper for the court to dismiss a complaint in accordance with Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure only if the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). With respect to this benchmark standard for the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has aptly noted the evolving standards governing pleading practice in federal court, stating that:
Standards of pleading have been in the forefront of jurisprudence in recent years. Beginning with the Supreme Court's opinion in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), continuing with our opinion in Phillips [v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 230 (3d Cir. 2008)], and culminating recently with the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, BU.S.B, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009), pleading standards have seemingly shifted from simple notice pleading to a more heightened form of pleading, requiring a plaintiff to plead more than the possibility of relief to survive a motion to dismiss.
Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 209-10 (3d Cir. 2009).
In considering whether a complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, the court must accept as true all allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences [*16]  that can be drawn therefrom are to be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O'Brien & Frankel, Inc., 20 F.3d 1250, 1261 (3d Cir. 1994). However, a court "need not credit a complaint's bald assertions or legal conclusions when deciding a motion to dismiss." Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997). Additionally, a court need not "assume that a . . . plaintiff can prove facts that the . . . plaintiff has not alleged." Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983). As the Supreme Court held in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), in order to state a valid cause of action, a plaintiff must provide some factual grounds for relief which "requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of actions will not do." Id., at 555. "Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Id.
In keeping with the principles of Twombly, the Supreme Court has underscored that a trial court must assess whether a complaint states facts upon which relief can be granted when ruling on a motion to dismiss. In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009), the Supreme Court held that, when considering a motion to dismiss, a court should "begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth." Id., at 679. According to the Supreme Court, "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of [*17]  a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id., at 678. Rather, in conducting a review of the adequacy of a complaint, the Supreme Court has advised trial courts that they must:
[B]egin by identifying pleadings that because they are no more than conclusions are not entitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.
Id., at 679.
Thus, following Twombly and Iqbal, a well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere legal labels and conclusions; it must recite factual allegations sufficient to raise the plaintiff's claimed right to relief beyond the level of mere speculation. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated:
[A]fter Iqbal, when presented with a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, district courts should conduct a two-part analysis. First, the factual and legal elements of a claim should be separated. The District Court must accept all of the complaint's well-pleaded [*18]  facts as true, but may disregard any legal conclusions. Second, a District Court must then determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a "plausible claim for relief." In other words, a complaint must do more than allege the plaintiff's entitlement to relief. A complaint has to "show" such an entitlement with its facts.
Fowler, 578 F.3d at 210-11.
As the Court of Appeals has observed:
The Supreme Court in Twombly set forth the "plausibility" standard for overcoming a motion to dismiss and refined this approach in Iqbal. The plausibility standard requires the complaint to allege "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955. A complaint satisfies the plausibility standard when the factual pleadings "allow[ ] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556, 127 S. Ct. 1955). This standard requires showing "more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Id. A complaint which pleads facts "merely consistent with" a defendant's liability, [ ] "stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of 'entitlement of relief.'"
Burtch v. Milberg Factors, Inc., 662 F.3d 212, 220-21 (3d Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1861 (2012).
In practice, consideration [*19]  of the legal sufficiency of a complaint entails a three-step analysis:
First, the court must "tak[e] note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim." Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1947. Second, the court should identify allegations that, "because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth." Id., at 1950. Finally, "where there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief."
Santiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 F.3d 121, 130 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950).
In considering a motion to dismiss, the court generally relies on the complaint, attached exhibits, and matters of public record. Sands v. McCormick, 502 F.3d 263, 268 (3d Cir. 2007). The court may also consider "undisputedly authentic document[s] that a defendant attached as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff's claims are based on the [attached] documents." Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993). Moreover, "documents whose contents are alleged in the complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the pleading, may be considered." Pryor v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 288 F.3d 548, 560 (3d Cir. 2002); see also U.S. Express Lines, Ltd. v. Higgins, 281 F.3d 382, 388 (3d Cir. 2002) (holding that "[a]lthough a district court may not consider matters extraneous to the pleadings, a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint may be considered [*20]  without converting the motion to dismiss in one for summary judgment"). However, the court may not rely on other parts of the record in determining a motion to dismiss, or when determining whether a proposed amended complaint is futile because it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O'Brien & Frankel, 20 F.3d 1250, 1261 (3d Cir. 1994).

B. Motion for Summary Judgment — Standard of Review
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Through summary adjudication, a court is empowered to dispose of those claims that do not present a "genuine dispute as to any material fact," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and for which a trial would be "an empty and unnecessary formality." Univac Dental Co. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., No. 07-0493, 702 F. Supp. 2d 465, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31615, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2010). The substantive law identifies which facts are material, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis that would allow a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id., at 248-49.
The moving party has the initial burden of identifying [*21]  evidence that it believes shows an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Conoshenti v. Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2004). Once the moving party has shown that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's claims, "the non-moving party must rebut the motion with facts in the record and cannot rest solely on assertions made in the pleadings, legal memoranda, or oral argument." Berckeley Inv. Group. Ltd. v. Colkitt, 455 F.3d 195, 201 (3d Cir. 2006), accord Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the non-moving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden at trial," summary judgment is appropriate. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. Summary judgment is also appropriate if the non-moving party provides merely colorable, conclusory, or speculative evidence. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. There must be more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the non-moving party and more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. Id., at 252; see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In making this determination, the Court must "consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Schs., 486 F.3d 791, 794 (3d Cir. 2007).
Moreover, a party who seeks to resist a summary judgment motion by citing to disputed material issues of fact must show by competent evidence that such factual disputes exist. Further, "only [*22]  evidence which is admissible at trial may be considered in ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Countryside Oil Co., Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., 928 F. Supp. 474, 482 (D.N.J. 1995). Similarly, it is well-settled that: "[o]ne cannot create an issue of fact merely by . . . denying averments . . . without producing any supporting evidence of the denials." Thimons v. PNC Bank, NA, 254 F. App'x 896, 899 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Thus, "[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported . . ., an adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations or denial." Fireman's Ins. Co. of Newark New Jersey v. DuFresne, 676 F.2d 965, 968 (3d Cir. 1982); see Sunshine Books, Ltd. v. Temple University, 697 F.2d 90, 96 (3d Cir. 1982). "[A] mere denial is insufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact, and an unsubstantiated doubt as to the veracity of the opposing affidavit is also not sufficient." Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 458 (3d Cir. 1969). Furthermore, "a party resisting a [Rule 56] motion cannot expect to rely merely upon bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions." Gans v. Mundy, 762 F.2d 338, 341 (3d Cir. 1985) (citing Ness v. Marshall, 660 F.2d 517, 519 (3d Cir. 1981)).
Finally, it is emphatically not the province of the court to weigh evidence or assess credibility when passing upon a motion for summary judgment. Rather, in adjudicating the motion, the court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the opposing party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). Where the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, then the non-movant's [*23]  must be taken as true. Id. Additionally, the court is not to decide whether the evidence unquestionably favors one side or the other, or to make credibility determinations, but instead must decide whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1363. In reaching this determination, the Third Circuit has instructed that:
To raise a genuine issue of material fact . . . the opponent need not match, item for item, each piece of evidence proffered by the movant. In practical terms, if the opponent has exceeded the "mere scintilla" threshold and has offered a genuine issue of material fact, then the court cannot credit the movant's version of events against the opponent, even if the quantity of the movant's evidence far outweighs that of its opponent. It thus remains the province of the fact finder to ascertain the believability and weight of the evidence.
Id. In contrast, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); NAACP v. North Hudson Reg'l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d 464, 476 (3d Cir. 2011).
There is a necessary corollary to these principles defining when summary judgment [*24]  may be appropriate. In the instant case, the plaintiff asserts in part that she is hamstrung in responding to the defendants' summary judgment motion, which is based largely upon the defendants' description of the facts and circumstances of this case, because she has not had a full opportunity to engage in discovery in this case. On this score the plaintiff has, in effect, invoked the protections of Rule 56(d), which provides as follows:
When Facts Are Unavailable to the Nonmovant. If a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may:(1) defer considering the motion or deny it;(2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or(3) issue any other appropriate order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d).
Rule 56(d) permits a court to defer consideration of a summary judgment motion when some further discovery is needed by the party opposing the motion in order to frame a meaningful response to the motion. Under these circumstances, we are mindful of the fact that: A[I]t is well established that a court 'is obliged to give a party opposing summary judgment an adequate opportunity to obtain discovery'" Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 565 (3d Cir. 2015) (quoting Doe v. Abington Friends Sch., 480 F.3d 252, 257 (3d Cir. 2007) (internal [*25]  citations and quotations omitted). Further, A[i]f discovery is incomplete, a district court is rarely justified in granting summary judgment, unless the discovery request pertains to facts that are not material to the moving party's entitlement to judgment as a matter of law." Shelton, 775 F.3d at 568. Therefore, as a general rule, we should refrain from declaring the facts to be undisputed for summary judgment purposes when it is evident that one party seeks discovery in order to fully respond to a motion for summary judgment.
It is against this analytical lens that we assess the plaintiff's claims.

C. The Plaintiff's Title VII and ADA Claims Against the Individual Defendants Should be Dismissed.
As an initial matter, the defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims against defendants Loucks and Scritchfield should be dismissed because neither Title VII nor Title I of the ADA allow for claims against individual defendants.
We agree.
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals held in Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., 100 F.3d 1061 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc) that individuals are not liable for Title VII violations. Id., at 1077-78. Since deciding Sheridan, the Third Circuit has since reiterated that "claims against individual supervisors are not permitted under Title VII." See Cardenas v. Massey, 269 F.3d 251, 268 (3d Cir. 2001); see also Emerson, 296 F.3d at 190 ("[I]ndividual [*26]  employees are not liable under Title VII."). The law in this area is clear, and has been for some time, and the plaintiff's Title VII claims against the individual defendants should be dismissed.
The ADA provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability. . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Title I of the ADA defines a "covered entity" as "an employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(2). The majority of courts within the Third Circuit have interpreted this language in concluding that the ADA does not provide for individual liability. See Koslow v. Pennsylvania, 302 F.3d 161, 178 (3d Cir. 2002) ("[T]here appears to be no individual liability for damages under Title I of the ADA . . . ."); Michalesko v. Freeland Borough, 18 F. Supp. 3d 609, 626 (M.D. Pa. 2014) ("Any claim against the individual defendants is further barred because the ADA does not impose individual liability."), aff'd sub nom. Michalesko v. Borough, 658 F. App'x 105 (3d Cir. 2016); McInerney v. Moyer Lumber & Hardware, Inc., 244 F. Supp. 2d 393, 398 (E.D. Pa. 2002) ("[A] growing number of district courts in this Circuit have concluded that there is no individual liability under the ADA, and this appears to be the consensus view."). In consideration of this substantial authority, it will be recommended that that the plaintiff's claims against each of the individual defendants for alleged violations of Title [*27]  VII and the ADA be dismissed.

D. The Plaintiff's Claims for Discrimination and Retaliation Under Title VII Should Not Be Dismissed Against SpiriTrust at this Time But The Plaintiff Should Be Required to Provide a More Definiite Statement of Her Claims Against Defendant Cura.
The plaintiff then brings a Title VII claim against both Cura and SpiriTrust, alleging in a fairly summary fashion that she suffered discrimination on the basis of race and that she was met with retaliation when she complained about the alleged ongoing discriminatory treatment. Specifically, Smith has alleged that she was discriminated against on the basis of her race under a "hostile work environment" theory, that she was met with retaliation when she tried to obtain relief from supervising employees, and that she was constructively discharged when she felt she could no longer work under the conditions at her employment. Her factual narrative in support of this claim is somewhat sparse, but is marked by one instance of the use of a racial epithet and other alleged episodes of hostile conduct. Liberally construed, Smith's complaint also describes alleged managerial indifference and hostility to her complaints about [*28]  racially divisive conduct in the workplace. Further, in a declaration which lies outside the pleadings, but was apparently inspired by the defendants' summary judgment motion, Smith avers further facts in support of her claims.
We find this to be a close case, presented on a somewhat murky record since the parties have combined and, in some instances, conflated what may be considered in a motion to dismiss and what we may examine when reviewing a motion for summary judgment. However, for the reasons set forth below, we recommend that these motions be granted in part and denied in part.
Title VII provides that an employer may not "discharge . . . or . . . discriminate against any individual with respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). A plaintiff may base a claim of discrimination on allegations which show that the work environment was "hostile," and where a plaintiff can show that a workplace is "so permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [a] victim's employment and create an abusive working environment[.]" Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 78, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998).
In [*29]  order to make a prima facie claim of race-based discrimination on the basis of a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must show that (1) she suffered intentional harassment based on her race; (2) the harassment was severe or pervasive; (3) the harassment detrimentally affected her; (4) the harassment would have detrimentally affected a reasonable person in similar circumstances; and (5) a basis for employer liability. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a); Huston v. Procter & Gamble Paper Prods. Corp., 568 F.3d 100, 104 (3d Cir. 2009); Lawrence v. F.C. Kerbeck & Sons, 134 F. App'x 570, 571 (3d Cir. 2005) (citing Aman v. Cort Furniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d 1074, 1081 (3d Cir. 1996)); Taylor v. JFC Staffing Assocs., 690 F. Supp. 357 (M.D. Pa. 2009). The last factor requires that the plaintiff point to facts showing that the employer was aware of the discrimination, yet failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action. Syed, 906 F. Supp. 2d at 358.
Workplace misconduct is not measured in isolation, and accordingly, the court's hostile work environment analysis "'must concentrate not on individual incidents, but on the overall scenario' because it is often difficult to determine the motivation behind allegedly discriminatory actions." Syed v. YWCA of Hanover, 906 F. Supp. 2d 345, 355 (M.D. Pa. 2012) (quoting Beaubrun v. Inter Cultural Family, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4075, *14-15 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 17, 2007)). To evaluate a plaintiff's allegations or proof, a court must evaluate the frequency of the alleged conduct, its severity, whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, and whether it unreasonably interfered with the employee's work performance. Lawrence, 134 F. App'x at 571-72; see also Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993).
Title VII [*30]  is not violated by "[m]ere utterance of an . . . epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee" or by mere "discourtesy or rudeness," unless it is so severe or pervasive as to cause an objective change in the terms or conditions of employment. Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 787, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998) (citations omitted). These considerations also inform an assessment of whether the conduct was "objectively" offensive, since "[c]onduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment . . . is beyond Title VII's purview." Harris, 510 U.S. at 21.
Read in a liberal fashion, our review of the factual narrative in the complaint in this case reveals a pattern of alleged antagonism, coupled with one isolated overtly racist statement, and allegations that some supervisors tacitly condoned the racist remark by refusing to condemn it and, instead, punishing Smith for her own allegedly intemperate behavior. While the "[m]ere utterance of an . . . epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee" or by mere "discourtesy or rudeness," standing alone is insufficient to state a Title VII claim unless it is so severe or pervasive as to cause an objective change in the terms or conditions of employment, Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787 (citations [*31]  omitted), these allegations of a racial epithet combined with on-going hostility and disparate treatment by management, taken together and liberally construed, may be sufficient to state a Title VII claim.
Smith's claim of Title VII retaliation is likewise somewhat problematic as pleaded. To make out a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show (1) that she engaged in protected activity; (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. Carvalho-Grevious v. Delaware State Univ., 851 F.3d 249, 257 (3d Cir. 2017). Ultimately, a plaintiff bringing a Title VII retaliation claim must be able to show that her participation in protected activity was the but-for cause of any alleged adverse employment action that she suffered. Univ. of Texas v. Univ. of Tex. Southwestern Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013) ("Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test stated in § 2000e-2(m). This requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer."); see also Grevious, 851 F.3d at 257 (noting that a plaintiff alleging Title VII retaliation "has a higher causal burden than a plaintiff [*32]  asserting a claim of direct status-based discrimination under Title VII.").
Liberally construed, Smith's complaint appears to assert that her co-workers created a hostile work environment. Further, after she alleges that she complained to Scritchfield and other managers about alleged racial discrimination in her work environment, the complaint can be construed as asserting that managers disciplined her, tacitly condoned the conduct of others, and transferred her to another, less desirable work assignment. Taken together, these allegations may be legally sufficient to state Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims, recognizing that it is not especially difficult for a plaintiff to allege the elements of a prima facie claim.
Further, to the extent that the defendants seeks summary judgment on these Title VII claims, we note that the plaintiff has asserted that she should be entitled to discovery prior to any summary judgment resolution of these issues of workplace discrimination. Although the plaintiff has not fully complied with all of the strictures of Rule 56(d), acting out of an abundance of caution, we believe that the parties should be permitted to fully develop this factual record [*33]  prior to any summary judgment adjudication of these workplace discrimination claims. We recommend this course recognizing that "it is well established that a court 'is obliged to give a party opposing summary judgment an adequate opportunity to obtain discovery'" Shelton, 775 F.3d at 565 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Further, "[i]f discovery is incomplete, a district court is rarely justified in granting summary judgment, unless the discovery request pertains to facts that are not material to the moving party's entitlement to judgment as a matter of law." Id. at 568.
While we believe that this Title VII claim survives, at least with respect to Smith's employer, SpiriTrust, there are ambiguities in this claim, as pleaded, which call for dismissal of Cura as a defendant or, in the alternative, a more definite statement of the claim against Cura. In particular, Smith treats SpiriTrust and Cura as a single entity, when in fact it is plain that they are two separate companies. This conflation of parties is significant in this case since Title VII liability only attaches to an employer. Thus, "to state a Title VII claim, [a plaintiff] must allege an employment relationship with the defendant[]." Covington v. Int'l Ass'n of Approved Basketball, 710 F.3d 114, 119 (3d Cir. 2013).
Here, as we [*34]  construe the complaint it states that Smith was employed by SpiriTrust, but worked with persons who were separately employed by Cura. (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 13-19). Moreover, much of the conduct which Smith found offensive seems to be attributed to Cura employees, although liberally construed it also appears that Smith is alleging that SpiriTrust allowed these offensive conditions to persist. Despite the fact that Smith's complaint appears to clearly identify SpiriTrust as her employer, she still seeks to hold Cura and SpiriTrust jointly liable for Title VII violations on the basis of a theory that is not clearly articulated in her complaint. Instead, Smith first contends in response to the Cura's motion to dismiss that SpiriTrust and Cura were joint employers and are therefore jointly liable in this case.
There are several problems with this proposition. First, in our view, Smith's complaint does not allege that Cura and SpiriTrust were joint employers of the plaintiff. Moreover, Smith cannot insert these allegations into her complaint through a response to Cura's motion to dismiss, since it is well-settled that a plaintiff cannot amend a complaint through the filing of a brief, or through arguments [*35]  set forth in a brief opposing a dispositive motion. Indeed, "[i]t is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss." Pennsylvania ex rel. Zimmerman v. Pepsico, Inc., 836 F.2d 173, 181 (3d Cir. 1988) (quoting Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir. 1984)); cf. Frederico v. Home Depot, 507 F.3d 188, 202 (3d Cir. 2007) ("[W]e do not consider after-the-fact allegations in determining the sufficiency of [a] complaint under Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6).").
Since Smith's complaint does not adequately allege an employment relationship with Cura, this Title VII claim should be dismissed as Cura, but we recommend that Smith be given leave to amend her complaint by alleging well-pleaded facts as to Cura which would establish a joint employment relationship, if she can. We recommend this course mindful of the fact that in civil rights cases, plaintiffs often should be afforded an opportunity to amend a complaint before the complaint is dismissed in its entirety, see Fletcher-Hardee Corp. v. Pote Concrete Contractors, 482 F.3d 247, 253 (3d Cir. 2007), unless granting further leave to amend is not necessary in a case such as this where amendment would be futile or result in undue delay. Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, 235 (3d Cir. 2004).6

E. The Plaintiff's Claim Under 42 U.S.C. Section 1981 Survives with Respect to SpiriTrust But The Plaintiff Should Be Required to Provide a More Definiite Statement of Her Claims Against Defendant Cura.
Smith also claims that she entered into an employment contract with [*36]  SpiriTrust, but that the defendants' "unlawful discrimination and retaliation deprived [her] of the rights and benefits to which she was contractually entitled, thereby violating 42 U.S.C. § 1981." (Doc. 1, ¶ 71). Specifically, Smith alleges that the discrimination that she faced "adversely affected her terms and conditions of employment." (Id., ¶ 67). Section 1981 provides, in part, as follows:
All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.
42 U.S.C. § 1981. Section 1981 "affords a federal remedy against discrimination in private employment on the basis of race." Johnson v. Railway Exp. Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 459-60, 95 S. Ct. 1716, 44 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1975).
Courts within this Circuit have applied the familiar McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework for allegations of racial discrimination under section 1981. See Grigsby v. Kane, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1624, *28 (M.D. Pa. 2005), aff'd 157 F. App'x 539 (3d Cir. 2005). Under this framework,
the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case by demonstrating that she is a member of a protected class. The [*37]  plaintiff must then establish that she was qualified for an employment position, but was not hired for the position "under circumstances that give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination." See Waldron v. SL Indus., Inc., 56 F.3d 491, 494 (3d Cir. 1995). When the plaintiff establishes this prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate one or more legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its employment decision. Id. If the defendant produces one or more legitimate reasons, the presumption of discrimination is rebutted. The plaintiff must then prove that the employer's reasons for its employment decision were pretextual -- that is, that they are false and that the real reason for the employment decision was discriminatory. Id.
Grigsby, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1624, *28-30, aff'd 157 F. App'x 539 (3d Cir. 2005).
Given the fact that analysis of claims under § 1981 parallels that employed under Title VII for racial discrimination claims, for the reasons set forth in our discussion of Smith's Title VII claims, we believe that at the pleading stage Smith has alleged a plausible § 1981 claim against SpiriTrust. However, we submit that her claims against Cura—who did not have a contractual relationship with Smith—should be dismissed without prejudice to the plaintiff endeavoring to file an amended complaint [*38]  which further and more clearly articulates the basis for this legal claim against Cura.

F. The Plaintiff's ADA Claims Should be Dismissed.
In our view, Smith's ADA claims are more problematic on several scores and, as pleaded, fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The purpose of the ADA is to "prevent employment discrimination of qualified individuals on account of their disability." Koller v. Riley Riper Hollin & Colagreco, 850 F. Supp. 2d 502, 512 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). The Act requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, unless the employer demonstrates that such accommodations would impose an undue hardship in the operation of their business." Id. (quoting Fleck v. WILMAC, Corp., No. 10-5562, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54039, *10 (E.D. Pa. May 19, 2011)).
The ADA was substantially amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (as codified in provisions of 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.), which became effective as of January 1, 2009, and therefore the amendments to the ADA are applicable to this case. In passing the amendments to the legislation,
Congress has made clear that the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis. Indeed, Congress has instructed that in construing the definition [*39]  of 'disability' under the ADA, it shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under the ADA, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the [ADA].
Rubano v. Farrell Area Sch. Dist., 991 F. Supp. 2d 678, 690 (W.D. Pa. 2014) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Congress's purpose in amending the ADA was to "reinstat[e] a broad scope of protection" under the ADA. Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 § 2(b). Under this statutory mandate, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") revised its implementing regulations to define disability "broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.1(c)(4). Review of the definitions provided by the Act and its implementing regulations make clear the expansive reach of the statute's protections.
Under the ADAAA, to qualify as disabled, a plaintiff must prove one of the following: (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) a record of such impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
The ADA defines "disability," in pertinent part, as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). "Major life activities" include functions such as "caring for [*40]  oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(i). In determining examples of major life activities, the regulations provide that the term "major" shall not be interpreted to create a "demanding standard" for disability. Id. § 1630.2(i)(2).
With respect to major life activities, the regulations provide that the term "substantially limits" shall be defined broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to "the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA" and also is "not meant to be a demanding standard." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i). An impairment is considered a disability "if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population." Id. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). However, an impairment "need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting," id., although "not every impairment will constitute a disability[.]" Id. The thrust of the ADAAA and its implementing regulations thus [*41]  call for broad coverage and consideration of an individual's own particular circumstances in determining whether that individual is suffers from a disability within the meaning of the Act.
An impairment that is episodic or even one that is in remission may still qualify as a disability so long as it "substantially limit[s] a major life activity when it is active." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)D); accord Britting v. Sec'y, Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 409 F. App'x 566, 568 (3d Cir. 2011); Pallatto v. Westmoreland County Children's Bureau, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27008, *29 (W.D. Pa. 2014). Likewise, a disability may continue even after a person has surgery or other mitigating treatment, provided the person continues to be substantially limited in a major life activity. See, e.g., Mengel v. Reading Eagle Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45300, 2013 WL 1285477, *3-4 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 29, 2013) (plaintiff continued to suffer from problems with balance after undergoing surgery on a brain tumor); see also Lloyd v. Housing Auth. Of the City of Montgomery, 857 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1263 (M.D. Ala. 2012) ("At bottom, the expanded definitions of 'disability' and 'major life activities' mean that treatable yet chronic conditions like hypertension and asthma render an affected person just as disabled as a wheelchair-bound paraplegic—if only for the purposes of disability law.").
In order to make out a prima facie claim for workplace discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she is (1) disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the [*42]  job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer, and (3) has suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of the discrimination.7 Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 F.3d 177, 185 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Stadtmiller v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc., 491 F. App'x 334, 336 (3d Cir. 2012); Gaul v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir. 1998).
The ADA also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who oppose an act or practice [*43]  made unlawful by the ADA or because the employee has made a charge under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a); Shellenberger v. Summit Bancorp, Inc., 318 F.3d 183, 188 (3d Cir. 2003) ("it is unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee based upon the employee's opposition to anything that is unlawful under the ADA."). Although requesting a reasonable accommodation does not appear to "fit[ ] within the literal language of the statute," Soileua v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1997), the Third Circuit has held that making a good-faith request for accommodation is protected activity for purposes of the ADA's anti-retaliation provision. Shellenberger, 318 F.3d at 191.
To make out a prima facie case of illegal retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show (1) protected employee activity, (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity, and (3) a causal relationship between the protected activity and the adverse action. Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 759 (3d Cir. 2004); Fogleman v. Mercy Hosp., Inc., 283 F.3d 561, 567-68 (3d Cir. 2002). The same McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework described above with respect to ADA discrimination claims also applies to ADA retaliation claims. In all cases involving alleged retaliation, a plaintiff must prove that retaliatory animus played a role in the employer's decision-making process and that it had a determinative effect on the outcome of the process. Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 501 (3d Cir. 1997) [*44] . That burden always remains with the plaintiff. Id.
In this case, we believe that there are a series of ambiguities and inadequacies in the plaintiff's complaint which combine to defeat her ADA claims at this time. First, it is unclear what disabilities Smith is asserting since at various times she refers to either workplace injuries suffered in late June 2019 or the lingering effects of a stroke which she had previously experienced. (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 46-52). Further, it is apparent from Smith's complaint that neither of these conditions was known to the defendants prior to late June and early July 2019, shortly before Smith resigned. Therefore, these conditions may not form the basis for any ADA claim prior to the time when the defendants are placed on notice of Smith's disabilities.
Moreover, with respect to her June 2019 workplace injury, it appears from Smith's complaint that her employer actually engaged in an interactive process designed to accommodate her physical limitations by providing her with a different, less physically-demanding duty assignment. Since a reassignment may constitute a reasonable accommodation, the facts pleaded by Smith do not clearly state an ADA claim against [*45]  SpiriTrust in this regard. See Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827, 830 (3d Cir. 1996). While Smith alleges that, during this interactive process she was questioned about her ability to read—a remark which she viewed as discriminatory—it is well-settled that "'stray' remarks or an isolated comment are insufficient to establish discrimination." Lincoln v. Momentum Sys. Ltd., 86 F. Supp. 2d 421, 432 (D.N.J. 2000). Thus, this single remark, made at a time when the complaint alleges that efforts were being made to accommodate her injury, does not suffice to save this ADA claim. Likewise, Smith's ADA claim encompasses both SpiriTrust and Cura, but is devoid of facts showing that Cura was her employer, a prerequisite to liability under the ADA. Given these deficiencies in Smith's ADA claim, we recommend that this claim be dismissed, but that Smith be afforded an opportunity to try to address the deficiencies noted in this Report and Recommendation through the filing of an amended complaint.

G. The Plaintiff's Claim Under 42 U.S.C. Section 1985 Should be Dismissed.
Finally, Smith claims that the defendants conspired together to discriminate and retaliate against her because of her race in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). (Doc. 1, ¶ 76). On this score, Smith's § 1985(3) conspiracy claim is pleaded in a fairly conclusory fashion. (Id. ¶¶ 75-84). It does not specify [*46]  the actions taken by alleged conspirators or the precise statutory rights which the conspirators are alleged to have violated.
Section 1985(3) provides that:
If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; . . ., the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators.
42 U.S.C. § 1985(3).
The Supreme Court has made clear what a plaintiff must allege to state a claim under § 1985(3): "(1) a conspiracy; (2) for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; and (3) an act in furtherance of the conspiracy; (4) whereby a person is injured in his person or property or deprived of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States." United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners v. Scott, 463 U.S. 825, 828-29, 103 S. Ct. 3352, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1049 (1983). However, under prevailing pleading standards, a party may not simply rely upon a talismanic invocation of [*47]  the word "conspiracy" to state a § 1985(3) conspiracy claim. More is needed and, in our view, Smith's § 1985(3) conspiracy claim is flawed because this claim is not pled with sufficient clarity. On this score:
[I]n order to plead a civil rights action based upon a claim of conspiracy, a plaintiff must plead allegations that are:
supported by facts bearing out the existence of the conspiracy and indicating its broad objectives and the role each defendant allegedly played in carrying out those objectives. Bare conclusory allegations of "conspiracy" or "concerted action" will not suffice to allege a conspiracy. The plaintiff must expressly allege an agreement or make averments of communication, consultation, cooperation, or command from which such an agreement can be inferred.
Flanagan v. Shively, 783 F.Supp. 922, 928 (M.D.Pa.1992). Furthermore, when pleading a conspiracy claim, a plaintiff cannot rely upon subjective suspicion and speculation. Young v. Kann, 926 F.2d 1396, 1405 n. 16 (3d Cir.1991). Quite the contrary, "to properly plead an unconstitutional conspiracy, a plaintiff must assert facts from which a conspiratorial agreement can be inferred. D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational Tech. Sch., 972 F.2d 1364, 1377 (3d Cir.1992); see also Startzell v. City of Philadelphia, 533 F.3d 183, 205 (3d Cir.2008) (stating that a conspiracy requires a 'meeting of the minds') (further citation omitted). This holding remains good law following Twombly and Iqbal, which, [*48]  in the conspiracy context, require 'enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made,' in other words, 'plausible grounds to infer an agreement.' Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929." Great W. Mining & Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, 615 F.3d 159, 178 (3d Cir.2010) cert. denied,     U.S.    , 131 S.Ct. 1798, 179 L.Ed.2d 655 (U.S.2011).[In considering the sufficiency of civil rights conspiracy claims] We are mindful of these pleading requirements, which are considered together with the standards of pleading applicable to all civil actions in federal court as defined in Twombly and Iqbal, supra.
Victor v. Huber, No. 3:12-CV-282, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186403, 2012 WL 7463723, at *14 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 29, 2012), report and recommendation adopted sub nom., Victor v. Hubbard, No. 3:12-CV-00282, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26320, 2013 WL 704654 (M.D. Pa. Feb. 26, 2013).
Thus, "'[t]o withstand a motion to dismiss, a complaint alleging a civil rights conspiracy should identify with particularity the conduct violating plaintiffs' rights, the time and place of these actions, and the people responsible therefor.' Specific allegations of an agreement to carry out the alleged chain of events is essential in stating a claim for conspiracy. [T]he [plaintiff] must provide more than 'mere incantation of the words "conspiracy" or "acted in concert "' to satisfy her Rule 8 pleading requirement." Tarapchak v. Lackawanna Cty., 173 F. Supp. 3d 57, 73 (M.D. Pa. 2016), appeal dismissed (Aug. 16, 2016), reconsideration denied, No. CV 15-2078, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193713, 2016 WL 9738115 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 6, 2016).
Judged against these benchmarks, the cursory style of pleading [*49]  employed here is inadequate to state a § 1985(3) conspiracy claim. In particular, this complaint fails because it is unclear precisely what rights of Smith's the defendants are alleged to have violated. In this regard, the gravamen of Smith's complaint seems to be a Title VII race discrimination claim. However, to the extent that Smith is attempting to also cloak her Title VII claim as a conspiracy claim under § 1985(3), this claim runs afoul of the well-settled rule that: "§ 1985(3) may not be invoked to redress violations of Title VII." Great Am. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Novotny, 442 U.S. 366, 378, 99 S. Ct. 2345, 2352, 60 L. Ed. 2d 957 (1979).
Simply put, Smith cannot allege a § 1985(3) conspiracy to violate Title VII, which is what she appears to attempt to do in this complaint. Rather, greater clarity and precision in pleading is required before this claim could proceed further. Therefore, this claim should also be dismissed without prejudice to the timely submission of a more fulsome amended complaint.

IV. Recommendation
For the foregoing reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that the defendants' dispositive motions, (Docs. 6, 18), be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as follows:
First, Smith's Title VII and ADA claims should be dismissed as to the individual defendants, Loucks and Scritchfield.
Second, Smith's Title VII and § 1981 claims [*50]  should be dismissed as to defendant Cura Hospitality but defendant SpiriTrust's motion to dismiss these claims should be DENIED, and any motion for summary judgment should be DEFERRED pending completion of discovery.
Third, as currently pleaded, Smith's ADA claims fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and should be DISMISSED.
Fourth, Smith's § 1985(3) conspiracy claim is legally insufficient as it is currently pleaded and should be DISMISSED.
IT IS FURTHER RECOMMENDED that the plaintiff be granted leave to amend her complaint to remedy the deficiencies identified in this report and recommendation.
The parties are hereby placed on notice that pursuant to Local Rule 72.3:
Any party may object to a magistrate judge's proposed findings, recommendations, or report addressing a motion or matter described in 28 U.S.C. § 636 (b)(1)(B) or making a recommendation for the disposition of a prisoner case or a habeas corpus petition within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy thereof. Such party shall file with the clerk of court, and serve on the magistrate judge and all parties, written objections which shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings, recommendations or report to which objection is [*51]  made and the basis for such objections. The briefing requirements set forth in Local Rule 72.2 shall apply. A judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made and may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge, however, need conduct a new hearing only in his or her discretion or where required by law, and may consider the record developed before the magistrate judge, making his or her own determination on the basis of that record. The judge may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses, or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.
