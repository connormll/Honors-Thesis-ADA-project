REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. INTRODUCTION
This action arises out of Plaintiff's employment with Defendant Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (Nuclear Solutions). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to accommodate his disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., which led to his constructive discharge. Presently before the court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 32). Plaintiff timely filed a Response (ECF No. 37) to the Motion, to which Defendant filed a Reply (ECF No. 39). All pretrial proceedings in this case were referred to the undersigned pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and (B) and Local Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g), DSC. This report and recommendation is entered for review by the district judge.

II. FACTS
Defendant operates the Savannah River Site (SRS) under a Management and Operations contract [*2]  with the Department of Energy. Plaintiff began his employment at the SRS in 1989 as a Reproduction Operator. Pl. Dep. 28-29. His title later became Production Operator, and he was responsible for monitoring the operations at Defendant's Consolidated Incineratory Facility from 1995 through 2000. Pl. Dep. 31-32, 63-64 and Ex. 4. After the Consolidated Incinerator Facility closed in 2000, Plaintiff was transferred to H-Canyon and continued working as a Production Operator in that facility until 2011 when he was transferred to L-Area. Pl. Dep. 32-33. Plaintiff's work as a Production Operator involved reading and monitoring gauges, taking and documenting equipment readings, completing sample requests, and operating and monitoring instrumentation throughout the facilities to which he was assigned. Pl. Dep. Ex.4; Franklin Dep. Ex. 1. To meet the requirements as a Production Operator, Baxley was required to obtain and maintain all qualifications for the facility to which he was assigned. Pl. Dep. 64 and Ex. 4; Franklin Dep. 9 and Ex. 1.
In 2009, while working as a Production Operator in H-Canyon, Plaintiff was placed on work restrictions that limited him to working only day shifts. Pl. Dep. [*3]  34-35. Prior to this restriction, Plaintiff worked a 12-hour shift that began at 6:30 p.m. and ended at 6:30 a.m. Pl. Dep. 35. Because Plaintiff suffered from sleep apnea, his doctor believed the overnight shift was affecting Plaintiff's health and requested that Plaintiff be placed on day shifts only. Pl. Dep. 35, 37. Defendant's Site Medical1 approved Plaintiff's doctor's request and placed Plaintiff on a work restriction for day shifts only effective March 9, 2009. Pl. Dep. 36 and Ex. 2. Baxley was then placed on day shift and remained on day shifts, in compliance with his doctor's recommendations and Site Medical's work restriction.
In October of 2012, Plaintiff applied for a Production Operator position at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), which is the applied research and development laboratory at the SRS. Pl. Dep. 50-51. Plaintiff was then transferred to SRNL's Research Operations Group in October of 2012 as a grade 18 Production Operator. Pl. Dep. 34, 51, 63. Upon transferring to SRNL, Plaintiff reported to Cindy Lyons, First Line Manager. Pl. Dep. 34; Franklin Dep. 7-8. Lyons reported to Kenny Franklin, Facility Manager. Pl. Dep. 34; Franklin Dep. 8. Plaintiff was [*4]  transferred to SRNL for a day shift position, but SNRL operated approximately four shifts throughout the day and a Production Operator could be called upon to work another shift temporarily if needed. Pl. Dep. 40; Franklin Dep. 64; Fowler Aff. ¶ 5. At the time Plaintiff transferred to SRNL, Franklin reviewed Plaintiff's personnel file, but did not see anything in the records that he reviewed that indicated that Plaintiff had a disability or was under any work restriction. Franklin Dep. 11; Bell Dep. 20-21. Plaintiff assumed that Lyons and Franklin were aware of his restrictions and did not notify them himself. Pl. Dep. 50; Franklin Dep. 20.
As a Production Operator at SRNL, Plaintiff was required to undergo training specific to that facility and obtain all qualifications for that facility. Pl. Dep. 46, 64 and Ex. 4; Franklin Dep. 9, 11-12 and Ex. 1. On October 30, 2012, Franklin provided Plaintiff with an Employee Information Record that set out all of the expectations and qualifications required of the Production Operator position at SRNL, which included learning the operations of three watch stations: 776-A Watchstation, Facility Operator Watchstation, and Control Area Operator Watchstation. [*5]  Pl. Dep., 44-45; Franklin Dep., 27-28, 41 and Ex. 2.
As part of his training to obtain the necessary qualifications as a Production Operator at SRNL, Plaintiff underwent an oral evaluation with Franklin in August of 2013. Pl. Dep. 51-52 and Ex. 3; Franklin Dep. 11-12, 16. During this oral evaluation, Plaintiff and Franklin performed a walkthrough of the facility. During this walkthrough, Franklin tested Plaintiff's knowledge of the facility's operations by asking him questions related to various operations and procedures in each of the areas of the facility. Pl. Dep. Ex. 3; Franklin Dep. 46. Plaintiff was required to pass his evaluation for each area; his failure to do so would result in disqualification for his position and Plaintiff would have to be reassigned to another position. Franklin Dep. 27-28, 41 and Ex. 3. During the walkthrough, Plaintiff was unable to provide Franklin with satisfactory responses to some of the questions. Pl. Dep. 53, 55-58. As a result, Franklin ended the evaluation and instructed Plaintiff to spend additional time learning certain operations. Franklin allowed Plaintiff the opportunity to undergo additional training or remediation to improve his knowledge [*6]  of the facility as Franklin believed that Plaintiff was capable of qualifying with some additional training. Pl. Dep. 59-60; Franklin Dep., 16, 54-56.
One area in which Plaintiff required additional training was certain ventilation processes, including ventilation hoods in the laboratory. Pl. Dep. 67-68 and Ex. 3. Plaintiff acknowledged to Franklin following the walk-though that he was weak on ventilation and he knew he needed more work in that area. Pl. Dep. 68. The ventilation hoods removed radioactive particles from the air in the laboratory areas in which technicians worked. Pl. Dep. 66- 67. As such, these hoods were required to operate the entire time that technicians were present. Pl. Dep. 66-67. Because the technicians only worked during the day shift, the ventilation hoods could not be taken off line during the day because doing so could expose the technicians to radioactive particles. Pl. Dep. 65-67. To take the ventilation hoods off line during the day, the rooms would have to be evacuated. Franklin Dep. 17. The entire process of taking the hoods off line and then returning them online (called an evolution) took approximately forty-five minutes, so evacuating the rooms for [*7]  that period of time would upset the technicians' work production. Franklin Dep. 17, 32, 48. As a result, Franklin told Plaintiff that he needed to temporarily move to another shift in order to undergo additional training when certain equipment could be taken offline. Pl. Dep. 64-65, 75; Franklin Dep. 54-56. The move to another shift would have allowed Plaintiff to be present when the laboratory ventilation hoods were taken offline at night and, therefore, he would have the opportunity to observe and train on that process. Pl. Dep. 65. At that time, Plaintiff informed Franklin that he was on a work restriction that limited him to working only day shifts. Pl. Dep. 71, 74; Franklin Dep. 20. Franklin then explained that they could make an appointment with Site Medical to review his restrictions and explained Defendant's interactive process to Plaintiff. Pl. Dep. 73-74 and Ex. 5; Franklin Dep. 21. Franklin suggested that his shift times may be able to be changed if his doctor and Site Medical agreed but that he needed to consult with them to determine options. Franklin Dep. 22.
Plaintiff was aware that simulation training was used throughout Defendant's facilities to demonstrate skill sets [*8]  to a trainer in order to obtain qualifications as Plaintiff had done it many times in his career with Defendant at other facilities. Pl. Dep. 68. However, whenever Franklin went through an oral evaluation with a Production Operator and that operator did not have a good basic understanding of the equipment, purpose, and operation of it, Franklin typically assigned the operator to shift work (night or weekend) so that he could actually start and stop the equipment rather than simulate the equipment. Franklin Dep. 16-17, 32-33.2 Jerry Taylor, another Production Operator who was undergoing evaluations at the same time as Plaintiff and did not perform well, was also assigned to shift work for additional training. Franklin Dep. 17, 33. Franklin testified that "very few" operators had trained on this particular equipment by simulation during the day shift. Franklin Dep. 33. Plaintiff acknowledges that he is not aware of any Production Operator being allowed to qualify on this ventilation process at SRNL by simulating the process. Pl. Dep. 69.The determination issued by the South Carolina Human Affairs Commission following Plaintiff's Charge of Discrimination provided, in part, that "witnesses [*9]  indicated there were no previous requirements for night training and management began telling new employees that night shift was required to train and qualify after [Plaintiff] retired." SCHAC Determination (Ex. 4 to Pl. Resp.).
Defendant maintains a policy and procedures regarding medical restrictions and accommodations under the ADA. Pl. Dep. and Ex. 5. When Full Service Employees such as Baxley have a disability or medical restriction that prohibits performance of the essential functions of the employee's job, human resources initiates an accommodation committee consisting of the employee's direct managers, and personnel from Site Medical, Human Resources, and Defendant's Equal Employment Opportunity offices. Pl. Dep. Ex. 5 at 6-7; Bell Dep. 10. Further, line management—in this case Lyons and Franklin—are required to complete an Employee Information Record notifying the employee that reasonable accommodation process has been initiated. Pl. Dep. 89 and Ex. 5 at 7. In the event that an employee's restrictions cannot be accommodated, Defendant then seeks to find other available funded positions within the employee's pay grade or a lower pay grade, if necessary, that the employee can [*10]  perform within his or her restrictions. Bell Dep. 10-11; Pl. Ex. 5 at 6-7; Fowler Aff. ¶ 10. In the event that no accommodation can be made and no positions are available, then the employee may be medically discontinued from employment. Bell Dep. 11-12; Pl. Ex. 5 at 6-7; Fowler Aff. ¶ 10.
Shortly after meeting with Franklin and notifying him of his restrictions, Plaintiff contacted Donna Fowler, the Human Resources representative assigned to SRNL. Pl. Dep. 82; Fowler Aff. ¶ 3. Fowler explained that a meeting would be held to discuss options for accommodating Plaintiff's restriction. Fowler Aff. ¶ 7. On August 26, 2013, Plaintiff followed up with Fowler by email inquiring about the status of the accommodation meeting. Pl. Dep., 101 and Ex. 8; Fowler Aff. ¶ 7. In that email, Plaintiff stated that he would be willing to work after 5:00 p.m. or come in when one of the necessary procedures was being performed so that he could train on that procedure. Pl. Dep. 102-03 and Ex. 8; Fowler Aff. ¶ 7. Fowler responded that a meeting was being scheduled and that she would follow up with him after the meeting. Pl. Dep. 103and Ex. 8; Fowler Aff. ¶ 7. Fowler forwarded Plaintiff's email to Dr. Monica [*11]  Manigo-Johnson with Site Medical and asked her to consider Plaintiff's offer to come in after 5:00 p.m. Fowler Aff. ¶ 8. In response, Dr. Manigo-Johnson explained that Plaintiff needed to provide new documentation from his treating physician releasing him from his work restrictions before she could issue a new Duty Disposition Report that would allow him to work any shift other than day shift. Pl. Dep. Ex. 9; Fowler Aff. ¶ 8. Franklin asked Plaintiff if his doctor would allow him to work the hours he proposed. Franklin Dep. 31-32.
On September 12, 2013, a "Path Forward" meeting took place consisting of Franklin; Mark Flake, SRNL Facility Manager; George (Ned) Baynum, Non-Exempt Personnel Coordinator; Fowler; Willie Bell, Manager, EEO and Diversity; and David Comer, Manager HR Policy & Employee Relations to discuss options for accommodating Plaintiff's restriction. Franklin Dep. 53 and Ex. 5; Bell Dep. 12; Fowler Aff. ¶ 9. During this meeting, Franklin discussed Plaintiff's progress toward completion of his qualifications, his remediation plan to allow Plaintiff to complete his training, and Plaintiff's restriction to work only on day shift. Franklin Dep. 54; Bell Dep. 8-9; Fowler Aff. [*12]  ¶ 9. The group also discussed Plaintiff's proposal to come in after 5:00 p.m. as well as other alternative scheduling options. Franklin Dep. 56-57; Bell Dep. 14; Fowler Aff. ¶ 9. However, the group agreed that Plaintiff could not work the proposed times unless Site Medical lifted or modified his restriction. Franklin Dep. 56-57; Bell Dep. 14, 17; Fowler Aff. ¶ 9.
Following the Path Forward meeting, Plaintiff met with Franklin and Lyons on September 19, 2013. Pl. Dep. 90-91. In that meeting, Franklin and Lyons provided Baxley with an Employee Information Record, which explained that the reasonable accommodation process had begun. Pl. Dep. 87, 89-90 and Ex. 7; Franklin Dep. 43; Fowler Aff. ¶ 10. Franklin and Lyons explained that if Plaintiff felt that his restrictions were no longer permanent and that he could work a shift rotation in order to complete his training, that he should contact his physician for reevaluation. Pl. Dep. 90 and Ex. 7; Franklin Dep.43-44. If Plaintiff's physician agreed, then Plaintiff was to take the documentation to Dr. Manigo-Johnson at Site Medical by October 14, 2013. Pl. Dep. 91, 93 and Ex. 7. Dr. Manigo-Johnson would then issue a revised Duty Disposition [*13]  Report that would allow Plaintiff to temporarily move to shift work to complete his training. Pl. Dep. 94 and Ex. 7. The Employee Information Record also informed Plaintiff that if his restrictions remained in place and that if he could not complete his qualification, that Defendant would seek another position for Plaintiff in accordance with its reasonable accommodation procedures. Pl. Dep. 94 and Ex. 7.
In the interim, management also began searching for other available grade 18 positions with Defendant in the event that Plaintiff could not have his restrictions lifted or could not complete his qualifications. Franklin Dep. 26-28. Franklin and Fowler met with Plaintiff and discussed what would happen if he could not qualify for his position. Franklin Dep. 26-28; Fowler Aff. ¶ 11. They discussed that, under Defendant's policy, they would determine whether or not another position was available for him with Defendant either in his same grade or a lower grade. If there were no available positions, then they would search for available positions in other facilities at the Site. Franklin Dep. 27-28; Fowler Aff. ¶ 11. At the time, there were no available positions within the Research Operations [*14]  Group if Plaintiff did not qualify. Franklin Dep. 59-60; Fowler Aff. ¶ 11. However, Franklin's goal was to help Plaintiff qualify for his position rather than require him to transfer to another position. Franklin Dep. 27-28, 60.
On or about September 24, 2013, Plaintiff met with his treating physician and requested that his work restriction be lifted for two months. Pl. Dep. 76, 92 and Ex. 6. Plaintiff's doctor provided him with a letter addressed to SRS Medical Department/Human Resources stating that Plaintiff would like a release from his work restrictions for a period of two months. Pl. Dep. 78-80 and Ex.6. However, Plaintiff did not provide the document to anyone at Site Medical as he was directed to do in the September 19, 2013, Employee Information Record. Pl. Dep. 78, 80, 95. In an email dated October 2, 2013, Plaintiff asked Fowler whether he should bring the letter from his doctor to her or make an appointment with medical. Pl. Email dated Oct. 2, 2013 (Ex. 7 to Pl. Resp.). On the top of the doctor's letter is written "Received 10-2-13," Pl. Ex. 6, and Fowler testified she received the letter around that time. Fowler Aff. ¶¶ 12-14.
Plaintiff had a meeting with Lyons, Franklin, [*15]  Fowler, Willie Bell with Defendant's EEOC office, and Ned Baynham with Human Resources sometime after the September 19, 2013, meeting, but the date of that meeting is unclear from the record. Plaintiff first testified that the meeting "probably" occurred after he received the letter from his doctor. Pl. Dep. 96-97. However, he later testified that his understanding of what needed to happen next following that meeting was that he needed to go to his doctor, and stated that the meeting must have occurred prior to visiting his doctor because "they were still requesting me to go to my doctor." Pl. Dep. 106-07. Plaintiff stated that they discussed the same things that were discussed at the September 19, 2013, meeting, and he asked Baynham if there were any other day jobs for him on site because Franklin told him they were not going to release him from his work restrictions. Pl. Dep. 99. Baynham informed Plaintiff that there were no such vacancies. Pl. Dep. 99.
In early October 2013, Plaintiff contacted Pat Smith in Human Resources to discuss his eligibility to retire. Pl. Dep. 109-10. He informed her that he was told there were no jobs available for him and he was going to be medically discontinued. [*16] 3 Pl. Dep. 111. Based on the information given to her by Plaintiff, Smith told Plaintiff it would be better for him to take early retirement than to be medically discontinued. Pl. Dep. 111. On October 9, 2013, Plaintiff notified Fowler that he had submitted his application for retirement and that he planned to retire effective October 31, 2013. Pl. Dep. 112 and Ex. 10. Baxley retired, as announced, on October 31, 2013.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, the moving party bears the burden of showing that summary judgment is proper. Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Summary judgment is proper if the non-moving party fails to establish an essential element of any cause of action upon which the non-moving party has the burden of proof. Id. Once the moving party has brought into question whether there is a genuine dispute for trial on a material element of the non-moving party's claims, the non-moving party bears the burden of coming forward with specific facts which show a genuine dispute for trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The non-moving party must come forward with enough evidence, beyond [*17]  a mere scintilla, upon which the fact finder could reasonably find for it. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The facts and inferences to be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Shealy v. Winston, 929 F.2d 1009, 1011 (4th Cir. 1991). However, the non-moving party may not rely on beliefs, conjecture, speculation, or conclusory allegations to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Baber v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 977 F.2d 872, 874-75 (4th Cir. 1992). The evidence relied on must meet "the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at a trial on the merits." Mitchell v. Data General Corp., 12 F.3d 1310, 1316 (4th Cir. 1993).
To show that a genuine dispute of material fact exists, a party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Rather, the party must present evidence supporting his or her position by "citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1)(A); see also Cray Communications, Inc. v. Novatel Computer Systems, Inc., 33 F.3d 390 (4th Cir. 1994); Orsi v. Kirkwood, 999 F.2d 86 (4th Cir. 1993); Local Rules 7.04, 7.05, D.S.C.

IV. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA. The ADA provides:
No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a [*18]  disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.
42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA places an affirmative obligation on employers to make reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals if such accommodation will enable the employee to successfully perform the job in question. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Violations of the ADA occur when the employer fails to make reasonable accommodations for a qualified individual with a disability. Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n. 11 (4th Cir.2001). "In a failure to accommodate case, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing '(1) that he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of his disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the position ...; and (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations.'" Rhoads, 257 F.3d at 387 n. 11 (quoting Mitchell v. Washingtonville Ctr. Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 1, 6 (2d Cir.1999)).
For purposes of the ADA, a person is disabled when he has "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; [*19]  or (C) [is] ... regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C). Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not disabled because sleep apnea is not a per se disability and Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence beyond his work restriction that his sleep apnea substantially limited one or more major life activities. However, Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff was regarded as having a disability. An employee is regarded as having a disability if employer takes action "because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A). In 2009, Plaintiff was diagnosed with sleep apnea and Plaintiff was placed on a work restriction by Site Medical that limited him to working only day shifts due to his doctor's opinion that the overnight shift was affecting his health. Pl. Dep. 34-35, 37 and Ex. 2. When this work restriction became an issue in 2013 because of Plaintiff's training in his new position, David Comer in the Human Resources department stated that it should be handled "like any other medical restriction case (ADA), i.e., documented Path Forward meeting with Medical present; documented search for [*20]  other vacant job assignments that could accommodate and a network search of possible accommodations." Comer Email dated August 21, 2013 (Ex. 5 to Pl. Resp.). The steps that Defendant took address Plaintiff's medical restrictions are sufficient to show that Defendant regarded Plaintiff as having a disability.
Defendant next argues that it did not refuse to accommodate Plaintiff's disability or perceived disability. As an initial matter, Defendant accommodated Plaintiff's condition beginning in 2009 by scheduling him to work on day shifts only. Pl. Dep. 35. When Franklin, who was not Plaintiff's supervisor at the time he was originally placed on the restriction, determined that Plaintiff needed additional training that would require him to work some night shifts, Plaintiff notified him of the restriction. Pl. Dep. 50, 71. Franklin informed Plaintiff of Defendant's accommodations process and, shortly thereafter, an accommodations committee was formed to determine the appropriate next steps. Franklin Dep. 53 and Ex. 5; Bell Dep. 12; Fowler Aff. ¶ 9. The committee discussed various accommodations involving adjusting Plaintiff's work hours to allow for the additional training, but they ultimately [*21]  agreed that Plaintiff could not work the proposed times unless Site Medical lifted or modified his restriction. Franklin Dep. 56-57; Bell Dep. 14, 17; Fowler Aff. ¶ 9. Dr. Manigo-Johnson explained that Plaintiff needed to provide new documentation from his treating physician releasing him from his work restrictions before she could issue a new Duty Disposition Report that would allow him to work any shift other than day shift. Pl. Dep. Ex. 9; Fowler Aff. ¶ 8. Accordingly, Franklin and Lyons notified Plaintiff that he needed to provide a letter from his doctor to Dr. Manigo-Johnson in Site Medical by October 14, 2013. Pl. Dep. 90-91, 93 and Ex. 7; Franklin Dep.43-44. Plaintiff had at least one additional meeting with members of the committee during which they discussed the process and encouraged Plaintiff to obtain the letter from his doctor. Pl. Dep. 96-99, 106-07. Plaintiff obtained the doctor's letter on September 24, 2013, requesting that Plaintiff be released from his work restrictions for two months so that he could complete his training. Pl. Dep. 78-80 and Ex.6. However, he did not provide it to Site Medical, Pl. Dep. 78, 80, 95, and did not provide it to Fowler until about a [*22]  week later, approximately October 2, 2013. Fowler Aff. ¶¶ 12-14. Then, less than a week after he provided it to Fowler, on October 9, 2013, he notified Fowler that he had decided to retire and his last day would be October 31, 2013. Fowler Aff. ¶¶ 12-14. Plaintiff testified that he never checked with anyone at Site Medical to see if they received his doctor's letter or if they had made a decision regarding lifting his work restrictions prior to his decision to retire. Pl. Dep. 114-15, 123.
In defining "reasonable accommodation," the ADA regulations provide:
To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). The burden to engage in the interactive process is a dual one, and responsibility for identifying appropriate accommodations is shared between the employer and the employee. Anderson v. Roche Carolina, Inc., No. 4:10-2792-RBH, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13118, 2012 WL 368710, at * 9 (Feb. 3, 2012).
[N]either party should be able to cause [*23]  a breakdown in the process for the purpose of either avoiding or inflicting liability. Rather, courts should look for signs of failure to participate in good faith or failure by one of the parties to make reasonable efforts to help the other party determine what specific accommodations are necessary. A party that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith. A party that fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may also be acting in bad faith. In essence, courts should attempt to isolate the cause of the breakdown and then assign responsibility.
Crabill v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 423 Fed.Appx. 314, 323 (4th Cir.2011) (unpublished) (citation omitted). The interactive process here started well, with Plaintiff contacting Fowler in Human Resources to inquire about the process and offering suggestions for accommodation, Fowler (or someone within Human Resources) assembling a committee, consulting with Site Medical and holding a Path Forward meeting to determine the appropriate steps to take, and Franklin, Tyson and others meeting with Plaintiff to explain the accommodations process and the committee's determination that he needed to check with his doctor to see if his work restriction could be temporarily lifted. Plaintiff [*24]  also met with his doctor and obtained a note requesting that his work restriction be temporarily lifted. However, soon thereafter, Plaintiff decided that it would be in his best interest to retire, and he contacted Smith to determine his options and then notified Fowler on October 9, 2013, of his decision to retire. At the time Plaintiff decided to retire, the interactive process had not been completed. Fowler Aff. ¶ 15. However, once Plaintiff announced his decision to retire, the committee discontinued the process. Fowler Aff. ¶ 15.
Plaintiff testified in his deposition that he inquired about other available positions at SRNL because Franklin told him during a meeting that they were not going to release him from his work restrictions. Pl. Dep. 99. However, his subsequent testimony indicates that this meeting with Franklin (and others) occurred prior to his visit to the doctor and they continued to request that he go to the doctor. Pl. Dep. 107. Plaintiff knew that the decision whether to temporarily release him from his restrictions would come from Site Medical. Pl. Dep. 75. Further, Plaintiff testified that, once he did obtain the letter from his doctor requesting that he be temporarily [*25]  released from his restrictions, he did not follow up with Site Medical prior to making his decision to retire to determine if they had received his doctor's note or if they would have allowed him to temporarily work shifts. Pl. Dep. 114. He admits that had he been temporarily relieved of his work restrictions, he could have qualified for his position and remained in his position at SRNL, and that once he completed his qualifications, he knew that he would have been moved back to his day shift. Pl. Dep. 115-16.; see also Franklin Dep. 57-58 (testifiying that Plaintiff's move to the night shift would only be temporary, approximately 30-60 days, and he would return to the day shift once he passed his qualifications). For these reasons, the breakdown in the interactive process occurred with Plaintiff, not Defendant. Defendants established an accommodations process and informed Plaintiff of the steps he needed to take and Plaintiff failed to follow through with them. A party that obstructs or delays the interactive process, or simply fails to communicate by way of initiation or response, is not acting in good faith to find a solution. Anderson, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13118, 2012 WL 368710, at * 9 ; Fleetwood v. Harford Systems, Inc., 380 F.Supp.2d 688, 701 (D.Md. 2005); Berkner v. Blank, No. DKC 12-1390, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34320, 2013 WL 951562, at *7 (D. Md. March 11, 2013). Liability [*26]  for failure to provide reasonable accommodation ensues only where the employer bears responsibility for the breakdown. Berkner, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34320, 2013 WL 951562, at *7 (citing Steffes v. Stepan Co., 144 F.3d 1070, 1073 (7th Cir. 1998)); Lewis v. Md. Sheriff's Youth Ranch, No. ELH-11-02494, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101773, 2012 WL 3012634, at *11 (D. Md. July 20, 2012); accord Templeton v. Neodata Servs., Inc., 162 F.3d 617, 619 (10th Cir. 1998).
Plaintiff testifies that he did not follow up with Site Medical because he did not plan to switch to shift work for health reasons and he was "hoping he could get a job somewhere else, a day job somewhere else across the plant or either been allowed to qualify like the other people had previous-previously." Pl. Dep. 115. Thus, it appears that Plaintiff did not continue with the accommodations process and decided instead to retire because Defendant was not offering the accommodation he desired. An employee is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice. See Crawford v. Union Carbide Corp., 202 Fed 3d 257 (4th Cir. 1999); Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285-86 (11th Cir.1997) ("[a] qualified individual with a disability is not entitled to the accommodation of her choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation."). While an employee's preference for one accommodation over another may be taken into account, "the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations, and may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it [*27]  to provide." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9 app. Indeed, the accommodation chosen by the employer need not be the "'best' accommodation possible, so long as it is sufficient to meet the job-related needs of the individual being accommodated." Id.; see also Corrigan v. Perry, No. 97-1511, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 5859, 1998 WL 129929, at *9 (4th Cir. March 24, 1998).
Plaintiff testified that he hoped to be placed in another day job somewhere else across the plant or that he be allowed to qualify for his position as others had, presumably by demonstrating his knowledge regarding ventilation hoods in the laboratory through simulation rather than having to work the night shift. However, Plaintiff fails to show that he made his preferences for these accommodations known to anyone. At the time Plaintiff chose to retire, the members of the accommodation committee were waiting on a decision from Site Medical as to whether Plaintiff's hours could be changed and Site Medical was waiting on a note from Plaintiff's doctor that would allow for such a change. Although they had done a preliminary search to determine whether any other grade 18 day shift positions were available within SRNL, they had not yet looked for grade 18 positions outside of SRNL or lower grade positions because they had not yet reached the point where it was necessary. [*28]  Fowler Aff. ¶ 11; Bell Dep. 13-14; Franklin Dep. 34-36. In addition, even if Plaintiff had requested to qualify through simulation, Franklin testified that the simulation of the process had been offered to Plaintiff before he conducted the walkthrough with him, but because Plaintiff demonstrated a lack of understanding of the equipment during the walkthrough, he determined that Plaintiff needed to go to shift work on these processes with qualified operators to actually be involved with the process rather than just simulating it. Franklin Dep. 18-20.
Ultimately, "the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9 app. Even though Plaintiff felt Defendants should have accommodated him by allowing him to further train for his qualifications through simulation, Franklin felt that simulation training was not sufficient for Plaintiff. Further, although Plaintiff felt he should have been transferred to another position, Franklin's first preference was that Plaintiff qualify in the position he already held. Franklin Dep. 28. Because Plaintiff failed to continue with the accommodations process as decided upon by the committee, his [*29]  failure to accommodate claim is without merit.
For these same reasons, Plaintiff's claim of constructive discharge fails as well. It is undisputed that Plaintiff made the decision to retire and notified Fowler of his decision on October 9, 2013. There are two instances in which an employee's resignation may be found involuntary: (1) where obtained by the employer's misrepresentation or deception, and (2) where forced by the employer's duress or coercion. Stone v. University of Maryland Medical System Corporation, 855 F.2d 167, 172 (4th Cir. 1988). Plaintiff argues that Defendants stopped the training and qualification process, demanded that he move his workstation into his supervisor's office, ceased communicating with him entirely about the accommodation process, and had Smith contact him to inform him that there were no jobs for him and recommend that he retire in lieu of being medically discharged. However, the evidence in the record reveals, as discussed in detail above, that Defendant took the appropriate steps regarding the accommodation necessary for Plaintiff to complete his training and was waiting for Plaintiff to take the next step in the process before making any further decisions. In addition, Defendants had more than one meeting with him to discuss the process [*30]  and encourage Plaintiff to visit his doctor to discuss whether his restrictions could be temporarily lifted. Further, although Franklin asked Plaintiff to move his workstation into Lyons' office after his second meeting4 for more visibility while Plaintiff was training, Pl. Dep. 108-09, this factor is insufficient to establish that Plaintiff was under duress.5 Finally, Plaintiff's argument that Defendant had Smith contact him and recommend early retirement is belied by the very deposition testimony relied upon by Plaintiff. Plaintiff testified that he called Smith to discuss his options and told her that he would be medically discharged because there were no other jobs available to him. Pl. Dep. 110-11. However, the information Plaintiff asserts he provided to Smith was, as discussed above, incorrect.
In sum, Plaintiff fails to present sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of fact with respect to his constructive discharge claim or his reasonable accommodations claim. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate.6

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, it is recommended that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Document # 32) be granted and this case dismissed in its [*31]  entirety.
