Opinion



ORDER
Plaintiff Emma Johnston ("Plaintiff" or "Johnston"), pro se, has filed claims against Envision Physician Services ("Defendant" or "Envision") under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq.) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 et seq.). In response, Envision has filed a Motion for Summary Judgement (the "Motion"). [Doc. No. 52].1 For the following reasons, the Motion is GRANTED and this case dismissed.

I. BACKGROUND 2
The following facts are undisputed, unless otherwise noted:

A. Envision
Envision is a "clinician-led organization" that provides a wide range of patient services to hospitals, outpatient centers, and office-based medical settings. SUMF 1-2. One hospital it serves is Inova Fair Oaks Hospital in Fairfax, Virginia. SUMF 3. Envision describes itself as an "equal opportunity employer" which does not allow discrimination or harassment based on race, sex, color, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital or parental status, national origin, citizenship [*2]  status, genetic information, military or veteran status, disability, or any other classification protected by federal, state, or municipal law. SUMF 6. It also has an ADA Policy which provides for employees to alert their superiors or HR about a request for disability accommodation and then, once all necessary documentation is submitted by the employee, HR meets with the employee to engage in an "interactive" disability accommodation process. SUMF 7-8. Envision also prohibits retaliation against any employee who engages in protected activity. SUMF 9. Employees and managers are trained on the Employee Handbook, which includes the aforementioned policies. SUMF 10-12.

B. Plaintiff's Employment with Envision
Envision hired Plaintiff in January 2020 as a Newborn Hearing Screen Technician. SUMF 13. On February 17, 20203 , Johnston signed forms acknowledging receipt of Envision's employee handbook and various anti-discrimination, accommodation, and anti-retaliation policies. SUMF 14. She also stated she understood various types of inappropriate workplace behavior, including intimidating other employees, bullying, and excessive tardiness or absence. SUMF 14.
Johnston's direct supervisor throughout [*3]  her employment was Katherine Henry ("Henry" or "Supervisor"). SUMF 16. Johnston was hired to work 3-4 days per week, including weekends, but by May 2021 she "announced" she would only be working two Tuesdays per month due to conflicts with another job and her attendance at a law school. SUMF 17. During her employment, she routinely called out of her scheduled shifts or asked other team members to cover them. SUMF 17. Every time Plaintiff requested time off, Henry approved the request. SUMF 18.
In May 2020, Fairfax Hospital leadership informed Henry that there were a 108 newborn hearing tests that needed rescreens. SUMF 19. Almost two-thirds of those needed rescreens were attributable to Plaintiff who also worked significantly fewer shifts than the other screeners. SUMF 19. As a result of her disproportionately high rescreen numbers, Henry offered to retrain Plaintiff who refused the offer and was viewed as "combative" in her response to Henry. SUMF 20. Plaintiff also was viewed as combative and reactive towards other employees who tried to help her improve her testing skills. SUMF 21. In addition to the screening errors that she refused to improve upon, Plaintiff had other performance [*4]  issues with patients and staff, who complained about her "rude, unfriendly, and disruptive" behavior. SUMF 22-23. Based on these issues, Envision issued a formal written warning to Plaintiff on January 29, 2021, which stated that further "unacceptable behavior or unsatisfactory performance" could lead to disciplinary action including termination. SUMF 23.

C. May 2021 Incident
Plaintiff requested to be scheduled for only the final two Tuesdays in May and for the months thereafter. SUMF 24. On Sunday, May 9, 2021, Plaintiff emailed her supervisor at 11:00 p.m. that she was having back pain and may require surgery. SUMF 25. Henry asked when the surgery was scheduled for and instructed her to inform her coworkers as well as possibly fill out HR paperwork in order to take time off. Id. The next morning Plaintiff informed her supervisor that the surgery would take place the next day, Tuesday, when she was scheduled to be at work. SUMF 26. Later that morning, Plaintiff reached out to her coworkers asking for someone to cover her shift the following day and stating that she would begin working two Tuesdays per month beginning in June. SUMF. 27. A coworker responded:
Maybe you should have checked [*5]  with your coworkers to see if anyone was able to work before you made your decision to change from Thursday to Tuesday. You know we're always willing to help but sometimes we just can't. [Two team members] work other jobs on Tuesdays so that leaves just three people to ask and on short notice we may not be available. I know you must be in pain with your back but covering for people when you're the only one available to help out can be a pain also. This was a last minute request. If I had known sooner I would have been willing to return a day sooner. I hope it all works out and that someone can come in tomorrow morning. Depending on traffic and what time I make it home[,] I might be able to get in later in the afternoon but it's really vital to have someone in early in the morning as we all know.
SUMF 28.
A back and forth between Plaintiff and her co-worker ensued. Plaintiff separately reached out to her supervisor and stated "[t]ake this job and do what the hell you want with it" and "I can do without this job[,] it's not worth my health or getting me upset." SUMF 31. Plaintiff did not report for work after this date.4 SUMF 35. On June 3, 2021, Envision sent Plaintiff a letter confirming [*6]  it would process her notice of resignation via text effective May 10, 2021.5 SUMF 36.

D. EEOC Complaint
On June 4, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Fairfax County Office of Human Rights and Equity Programs, and with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). SUMF 37. On September 13, 2021, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights Letter to Plaintiff. Id. On September 17, 2021, Plaintiff filed this action. Id.

II. LEGAL PRINCIPLES

A. Pro se Litigant
Plaintiff is proceeding pro se and the Court has construed her filings "liberally." Carter v. United States, No. 3:19CV164, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121443, 2020 WL 3883253, at *2 (E.D. Va. July 9, 2020). But this requirement does not allow a court to "ignore a clear failure . . . to set forth a cognizable claim." See id. (citation omitted). A court cannot "act as the [plaintiff's] advocate and develop, sua sponte, [] claims that the [plaintiff] failed to clearly raise." Newkirk v. Cir. Ct. of City of Hampton, No. 3:14CV372-HEH, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113032, 2014 WL 4072212, at *1 (E.D. Va. Aug. 14, 2014).

B. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate only if the record shows that "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." See also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Evans v. Techs. Apps. & Serv. Co., 80 F.3d 954, 958-59 (4th Cir. 1996).
The party seeking summary judgment has the initial burden to show the absence of a material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A genuine issue of material [*7]  fact exists "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Once a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported, the opposing party has the burden of showing that a genuine dispute exists. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). To defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party "must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. (e) ("[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact."). Whether a fact is considered "material" is determined by the substantive law, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Id. at 248. The facts shall be viewed, and all reasonable inferences drawn, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Id. at 255; see also Lettieri v. Equant Inc., 478 F.3d 640, 642 (4th Cir. 2007).

III. ANALYSIS
Interpreting Plaintiff's complaint as either alleging a Title VII action or an ADA claim, Envision is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.6

A. Title VII Claim
Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [*8] , it is unlawful for an employer "to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Title VII also forbids employers from retaliating against an employee for opposing adverse actions that the employee reasonably suspects to be unlawful under Title VII and this provision is broader than Title VII's anti-discrimination provision. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3; see also Strothers v. City of Laurel, Maryland, 895 F.3d 317, 327 (4th Cir. 2018).7 To survive a motion for summary judgment and establish a claim for racial or sex-based discrimination or for unlawful retaliation, a plaintiff must produce "direct evidence" of discrimination or retaliation or else satisfy the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting scheme. Id. "Direct evidence encompasses conduct or statements that both (1) reflect directly the alleged discriminatory attitude, and (2) bear directly on the contested employment decision." Laing v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 703 F.3d 713, 717 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal quotations and citation omitted).
Under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting scheme, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); see also Merritt v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., 601 F.3d 289, 294 (4th Cir. 2010). The elements of a prima facie case of discrimination require a plaintiff to show "(1) membership in a protected class; (2) satisfactory job performance; (3) adverse employment action; and (4) different treatment than similarly situated employees outside the protected class." Coleman v. Maryland Ct. of Appeals, 626 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir. 2010), aff'd sub nom. Coleman v. Ct. of Appeals of Maryland, 566 U.S. 30, 132 S. Ct. 1327, 182 L. Ed. 2d 296 (2012). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must prove that (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) the employer acted adversely against her; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the asserted adverse action. Strothers, 895 F.3d 317 at 327 (internal quotations and citation omitted). In order to establish causation with respect to status-based discrimination claims, the employee must "show that the motive to discriminate [*9]  was one of the employer's motives, even if the employer also had other, lawful motives that were causative in the employer's decision." Guessous v. Fairview Prop. Invs., LLC, 828 F.3d 208, 216 (4th Cir. 2016), (quoting Univ. of Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. v., Nassar 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013)). On the other hand, "[r]etaliation claims . . . require the employee to show that retaliation was a but-for cause of a challenged adverse employment action." Id. at 217 (internal quotations and citation omitted).
If the plaintiff successfully carries this burden of establishing a prima facie case, then the burden shifts to the employer who must prove that it had a legitimate nondiscriminatory and non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Strothers, 895 F.3d 317 at 328. "This burden is one of production, not persuasion; it can involve no credibility assessment." Dawson v. Washington Gas Light Co., No. 19-2127, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 20706, 2021 WL 2935326, at *4 (4th Cir. July 13, 2021) (internal quotations and citation omitted). In presenting a legitimate, non-discriminatory or non-retaliatory reason for Plaintiff's termination, a defendant "need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons." Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). Instead, the defendant's "explanation provided must be legally sufficient to justify a judgment for the defendant." Id. at 255. And the defendant's reason must be both "clear and reasonably specific" to satisfy its burden of production. Id. at 258. If the employer carries this burden, [*10]  then the plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant-employer were not its true reasons but were a pretext for discrimination or retaliation. Id. at 253. Importantly, "[d]espite this burden-shifting framework, the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact remains with the employee at all times." Dawson, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 20706, 2021 WL 2935326 at *4 (internal quotations and citation omitted).
Title VII protects against discrimination on the basis of "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin" but not on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2; see also Washburn v. Harvey, 504 F.3d 505, 508 (5th Cir. 2007) (stating "Title VII does not proscribe discrimination on the basis of disability."). Plaintiff has failed to state facts that would establish a prima facie case of liability based on "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Plaintiff also failed to establish that she was retaliated against because of any protected activity and the adverse employment action she suffered came after she tendered what was reasonably understood as a resignation. Defendant's motion with respect to any Title VII claims is therefore GRANTED.

B. ADA Claim
The Americans with Disability Act of 1990 protects against discrimination of qualified individuals on the basis of disability in the [*11]  employment context. 42 U.S.C. § 12112. "The ADA defines "disability" as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment." Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., 252 F.3d 696, 702 (4th Cir. 2001). ADA claims are also analyzed under the McDonnell-Douglas burden shifting framework when plaintiff presents no direct evidence of discrimination, as is the case here. Jacobs v. N.C. Administrative Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 572 (4th Cir. 2015). Plaintiff brings three ADA claims—failure to accommodate, retaliation, and forced resignation. [Doc. No. 1] at 4.

i. Failure to accommodate
In order to establish a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must show (1) she was an individual with a with a qualifying disability under the ADA; (2) the employer had notice of the disability; (3) with accommodations she could perform essential functions of the positions; and (4) that the employer refused to make such accommodations. Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013). In cases where the employee makes a request for accommodation from the employer and communicates her disability, the employer has the "duty to engage in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation." Id. at 347.
Here, Envision granted Plaintiff every accommodation she requested. [*12]  In that regard, Plaintiff texted her supervisor on May 9, 2021 that she had sharp pain in her back and that she may need to take off work for surgery. SUMF 25. Plaintiff has not pointed to a request that was not granted; and there is no evidence in the record that suggests that Plaintiff requested more time off work or any other accommodations that were not granted. SUMF 25-35. Her supervisor acknowledged Plaintiff's message and worked to accommodate Plaintiff's request by asking when the surgery would take place, encouraging her to find coverage for her missed shifts, checking with HR about company protocol for time off, and noting that she would have to complete paperwork with HR . SUMF 25-26. The next morning, May 10, Plaintiff texted her Supervisor stating that her surgery would be the next day, May 11. SUMF 26. Again, in her response, her Supervisor worked to accommodate Plaintiff's situation. Id. She responded, "I am surprised you could schedule so quickly" and "I will forward the paperwork from HR later today when I get back. Thanks. Let me know who is working for you." Id. Later that day, her Supervisor granted Plaintiff the time off work, and Plaintiff sent her co-workers, [*13]  including her Supervisor, a group message requesting that someone cover Plaintiff's shift for the next day. SUMF 27-32. In the group message, her Supervisor helped Plaintiff find coverage for Plaintiff's time off and "advised [her] that she would make sure the shift was covered." SUMF 30-32. On the evening of May 11, Plaintiff and her Supervisor exchanged text messages about how the surgery went, and her Supervisor offered help and advice on dealing with the post-surgery discomfort. SUMF 33. From that point on, however, Plaintiff never returned to work. SUMF 35. Based on these facts, Envision is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim; and Defendant's motion is GRANTED with respect to any such claim.

ii. Forced resignation
The Court construes Plaintiff's complaint as raising an ADA-based constructive discharge claim because her complaint states "forced resignation." [Doc. No. 1] at 4. Even in the case of voluntarily resignation, an employee can still establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the ADA through showing that (1) "working conditions became so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee's position would [*14]  have felt compelled to resign" and that (2) the employee actually resigned due to these conditions. Perkins v. Int'l paper Co., 936 F.3d 196, 211-12 (4th Cir. 2019) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Intolerability comes with a high bar. Id. To satisfy the element, the plaintiff must go beyond showing that a reasonable person in the employee's position would consider "resignation as the wisest or best decision, or even that the employee subjectively felt compelled to resign" and must establish she "had no choice but to resign." Id. (internal quotations and citation omitted).
Plaintiff has failed to establish facts that would allow a reasonable fact finder to find that she was constructively discharged. As discussed above, Envision granted Plaintiff the time off she requested, helped arrange coverage for her missed work shifts, and followed up with Plaintiff to see if she needed any help recovering from her alleged surgery. SUMF 26-27, 30-33. Plaintiff got into text message arguments with her coworkers and with her Supervisor; however, in both instances, her Supervisor tried to end and alleviate the disagreement. SUMF 30-31. While a reasonable person might find that such arguments with coworkers make the workspace less enjoyable, a reasonable [*15]  person would not find that such arguments leave them with no choice but to resign. See William v. Giant Food Inc., 370 F.3d 423 (4th Cir. 2004) (holding that employee did not face intolerable work conditions even though the employee alleged "her supervisors yelled at her, told her she was a poor manager . . . chastised her in front of customers, and once required her to work with an injured back."). Defendant's motion to dismiss any ADA constructive discharge claim is GRANTED.

iii. Retaliation
Finally, Plaintiff's ADA-based retaliation claim fails due to her voluntary departure from Envision. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that she (1) "engaged in protected activity"; (2) "an adverse employment action was taken against [her]"; and (3) "there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action." Laber v. Harvey, 438 F.3d 404, 432 (4th Cir. 2006). By requesting to take time off for her surgery, Plaintiff engaged in protected activity; however, no adverse employment activity followed. SUMF 34-36. While Plaintiff claims that she was fired soon-thereafter fired, the undisputed facts show that she voluntarily resigned on May 10, 2021. See Id.;[Doc. No. 1] at 4; see alsoee Glymph v. Spartanvurg Gen. Hosp., 783 F.2d 476, 477-79 (4th Cir. 1986) (an employee's voluntary resignation cannot be considered [*16]  an adverse action); Laird v. Fairfax Cnty., Virginia, 978 F.3d 887, 894 (4th Cir. 2020) (no adverse action under the ADA if an employee voluntarily requests a transfer and the employer grants such a request) (collecting cases). Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, and Defendant's motion is GRANTED for any ADA-based retaliation claim.

IV. CONCLUSION
Accordingly, for the above reasons, it is hereby
ORDERED that Defendant Envision's Motion for Summary Judgment, [Doc. No. 52], be, and the same hereby is, is GRANTED and this case DISMISSED.
This is a Final Order for purposes of appeal. To appeal, Plaintiff must file a written notice of appeal with the Clerk's Office within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order as required by Rules 3 and 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. A written notice of appeal is a short statement stating a desire to appeal this Order along with the date of the Order Plaintiff wants to appeal. Plaintiff need not explain the grounds for appeal until so directed by the court.
