Opinion



MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
Believing that his employer, Defendant City of Gaithersburg ("the City"), discriminated against him based on his disabilities, responded inadequately to his requests for accommodations for his disabilities, and retaliated against him for making those requests, Plaintiff Mark J. Wilson filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") and then filed suit in this Court, pro se, against the City. Following the City's motion to dismiss and for summary judgment, the only remaining claim is that the City failed to provide accommodations for his disabilities, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112-12213. Discovery has concluded, and the City now moves for summary judgment on Wilson's failure to accommodate claims, arguing that he failed to file a timely EEOC charge and that he cannot establish a prima facie case. ECF No. 49.1 Although Wilson's EEOC charge was timely with regard to the City's May 3, 2011 response to [*2]  his February 4, 2011 report to his employer, Wilson nonetheless cannot establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate, because he simply did not request any accommodation in his February 4, 2011 report. Therefore, I will grant the City's motion for summary judgment.

Standard of Review
Summary judgment is proper when the moving party demonstrates, through "particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations . . . admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials," that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), (c)(1)(A); see Baldwin v. City of Greensboro, 714 F.3d 828, 833 (4th Cir. 2013). If the party seeking summary judgment demonstrates that there is no evidence to support the nonmoving party's case, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to identify evidence that shows that a genuine dispute exists as to material facts. See Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The Court considers the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all justifiable inferences in his favor. Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 585-86, 129 S. Ct. 2658, 174 L. Ed. 2d 490 (2009); George & Co., LLC v. Imagination Entm't Ltd., 575 F.3d 383, 391-92 (4th Cir. 2009); Titan Indem. Co. v. Gaitan Enters., Inc., No. PWG-15-2480, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49851, 2016 WL 6680112, at *1 (D. Md. Nov. 14, 2016).

Factual Background
Mark Wilson worked for the [*3]  City of Gaithersburg in the Department of Public Works as a Building Equipment Maintenance Specialist, under the supervision of Peter Geiling, from 2006 until the City terminated his employment in May 2011. Arnoult Aff. ¶ 13, ECF No. 49-3; Def.'s Mem. 3; Pl.'s Opp'n 2. According to Wilson, he has attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ("ADHD"), depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD"), and auditory processing disorder ("APD"). Pl.'s Ans. to Interrog. No. 1, at 3, ECF No. 49-4. He did not inform Geiling of his disabilities. Id.; Pl.'s Ans. to Interrog. No. 2, at 3.
Wilson did, however, ask Geiling in June 2009 to stop "ranting" and "calling people liars," contending that the ranting was "hurting" him. Pl.'s Ans. to Interrog. No. 1, at 3. In his view, this was a request for an accommodation, which Geiling denied. Pl.'s Opp'n 28; see Def.'s Mem. 3. Thereafter, Wilson asserts, there were numerous incidents that "triggered a mental impairment episode," Pl.'s Opp'n 9; see Pl.'s Ans. to Interrog. No. 3, at 4-9, but he only contends that he requested accommodations on two other occasions, Pl.'s Opp'n 11-13. First, on January 6, 2011, "Geiling's actions triggered Wilson['s] [*4]  medical condition," and then next morning, Wilson's psychiatrist, Steven Israel, M.D., provided a letter in support of Wilson's request for two week's leave, which was granted. Pl.'s Opp'n 12; Israel Ltr. 1, ECF No. 11-4; Arnoult Aff. ¶ 14. Then, on February 7, 2011, Wilson informed his employer:
On the morning of Friday February 4, 2011, Mark Wilson suffered a stress related illness from a hostile environment the actions of his supervisor Pete Geiling [sic].
...
The two incidents [on February 4, 2011] exacerbated an illness in which Wilson suffers. Wilson is getting treatment for this stress related illness.
Illness Rept. 3, ECF No. 11-6; Arnoult Aff. ¶ 15. On May 3, 2011, the City informed him that "he could not have been injured," which Wilson viewed as a denial of a request for accommodations. Pl's Opp'n 13.2 One week later, the City informed him that it had eliminated his position, and although he would be paid through the end of June 2011, May 10, 2011 was his last day of work. Arnoult May 10, 2011 Memo. to Wilson, ECF No. 49-5.
Wilson filed an EEOC Charge on February 10, 2012 with regard to discrimination that occurred on May 7, 2011. Notice of Charge, ECF No. 49-6. He alleged that [*5]  he was discriminated against based on age and disability, that his employer failed to grant his requests for reasonable accommodations, and that he was "discharged in retaliation for participating in protected activity." EEOC Charge, ECF No. 49-7. He filed suit in this Court on July 21, 2014. ECF No. 1.

Timeliness
"[F]ederal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over Title VII claims for which a plaintiff has failed to exhaust administrative remedies." Balas v. Huntington Ingalls Indus., Inc., 711 F.3d 401, 406 (4th Cir. 2013). To exhaust administrative remedies, a plaintiff must file a timely administrative complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). Id.; Jones v. Calvert Grp., 551 F.3d 297, 300 (4th Cir. 2009); Brent v. Priority 1 Auto. Grp., No. PWG-14-1705, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170623, 2016 WL 7178302, at *2 (D. Md. Dec. 9, 2016). In Maryland, the limitations period under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1) "is 300 days from the date of the allegedly discriminatory act," and consequently, "only those discriminatory acts which occurred within 300 days of th[e] date [of filing the administrative complaint] are timely filed." Lopez v. BMA Corp., No. DKC-13-2406, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180028, 2013 WL 6844361, at *7 (D. Md. Dec. 24, 2013).
As noted, Wilson filed his EEOC charge on February 10, 2012, and the EEOC charge states that the "discrimination took place" on May 7, 2011. Notice of Charge; Charge of Discrim. Similarly, Wilson now contends that his EEOC charge was timely based on his employer's May 3, 2011 [*6]  response to his February 7, 2011 Illness Report. Pl.'s Opp'n 20. The May 2011 events occurred less than 300 days before February 10, 2012. Thus, the EEOC charge was timely based on the employer's May 2011 actions. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1); Balas, 711 F.3d at 406. Wilson's allegations that his supervisor failed to stop "ranting" and "calling other people liars" in June 2009, when Wilson complained that the ranting was "hurting" him, see Pl.'s Opp'n 11, however, are unexhausted because they did not occur within 300 days before Wilson filed his EEOC charge. See Lopez, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180028, 2013 WL 6844361, at *7. Therefore, I will not consider that alleged failure to accommodate. See id.

Failure to Accommodate
To prevail on a failure to accommodate claim, Wilson must establish "(1) that he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of his disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the position . . . ; and (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations." Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n.11 (4th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). For purposes of this analysis only, I assume that Wilson has offered sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that he had a disability under the ADA definition of disability. [*7] 
The city argues that "it is undisputed that Mr. Wilson never told the City he was disabled." Def.'s Mem. 11. Wilson counters that "[t]he City had notice that Wilson had a medical condition on January 7, 2011, the day after Wilson's private meeting with supervisor Geiling resulting in Wilson having to take two weeks medical leave to recover from exacerbating his medical condition." Pl.'s Opp'n 2. In support, Wilson cites an affidavit from James Arnoult, who was the Director of the Department of Public Works at the time Wilson worked for the City. Arnoult Aff. ¶ 2. Arnoult stated:
On January 7, 2011 Mr. Wilson sent an e-mail to Mr. Geiling requesting sick leave. Attached to the email was a letter from a physician that stated "Mark Wilson is suffering an exacerbation of his illness and needs to take off from work. At this point, it is anticipated he'll be unable to work for about two weeks." This was the first notice the City had that Mr. Wilson suffered from any type of medical condition that required him to take leave.
Id. ¶ 14. Wilson also asserts that the City had "to acknowledge that Wilson had a medical condition," because "Wilson relied on his psychiatrist to notify the City of his [*8]  condition and the need to recover." Pl.'s Opp'n 6. As noted, his psychiatrist, Dr. Israel, submitted the letter that Arnoult referenced, informing Wilson's employer that "Mark Wilson [was] suffering an exacerbation of his illness and need[ed] to take time off from work." Israel Ltr. 1.
Yet, "[v]ague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations under the ADA." Huppenbauer v. May Dep't Stores Co., 99 F.3d 1130 (4th Cir. 1996) (quoting Morisky v. Broward County, 80 F.3d 445, 448 (11th Cir. 1996)). Here, Dr. Israel (whose medical specialty is not disclosed on his letterhead) only vaguely referred to an "illness" that required Wilson to "take time off"; he did not state its nature or duration. Thus, although the City granted Wilson the sick leave he sought in January 2011, Dr. Israel's brief letter to the City does not suffice to notify it that Wilson had an impairment that could require an accommodation under the ADA at a later date. See id. Indeed, Arnoult referred to the psychiatrist as a "physician," suggesting that he was not even aware that Wilson suffered from a "mental impairment," as opposed to a "physical impairment." See Arnoult Aff. ¶ 14.
Nonetheless, Wilson also cites a work-related Illness Report that he filed one month [*9]  later, on February 7, 2011, in which he informed his employer:
On the morning of Friday February 4, 2011, Mark Wilson suffered a stress related illness from a hostile environment the actions of his supervisor Pete Geiling [sic].
. . .
The two incidents [on February 4, 2011] exacerbated an illness in which Wilson suffers. Wilson is getting treatment for this stress related illness.
Illness Rept. 3. He stated that he had not been back to work since the incidents, one work day earlier. See id. at 2. "The burden to provide notice of a disability is 'not a great one . . . . Adequate notice simply informs the employer of both the disability and the employee's need for the accommodations for that disability.'" Rock v. McHugh, 819 F. Supp. 2d 456, 473 (D. Md. 2011) (quoting EEOC v. Fed. Express Corp., 513 F.3d 360, 369 n. 5 (4th Cir. 2008)). Wilson's February 7, 2011 Illness Report informed his employer that he has an ongoing "stress related illness" for which he was "getting treatment," Illness Rept. 3; that is adequate notice of Wilson's disability for ADA purposes. See Rock, 819 F. Supp. 2d at 473.
I turn to whether the City had notice of Wilson's "need for the accommodations for that disability." See id. Wilson argues that he "asked that [Geiling's behavior] stop, by filing an injury report." Pl.'s Opp'n 6. He asserts that the Illness Report he filed, [*10]  "stating in writing that the supervisor's conduct triggering a reaction to a medical condition, hurting the employee . . . . was an accommodation request." Id. at 13. But nowhere on the Illness Report does Wilson request any accommodation. See Illness Rept. 1-3. Rather, Wilson describes the Illness Report as "a workman's comp. stress related injury" report, Pl.'s Ans. to Interrog. No. 3, at 8. The purpose of the Maryland Worker's Compensation Act, Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. §§ 9-101 - 9-1201, is not to secure accommodations for employees but rather "to protect workers and their families from hardships inflicted by work-related injuries by providing workers with compensation for loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment." Victor v. Proctor & Gamble Mfg. Co., 318 Md. 624, 569 A.2d 697, 699 (Md. 1990) (emphasis added) (quoting Howard Co. Ass'n, Retard. Cit. v. Walls, 288 Md. 526, 418 A.2d 1210 (Md. 1980)). Consequently, although Wilson informed the City of his disability, he did not provide adequate notice that "inform[ed] the employer of both the disability and the employee's need for the accommodations for that disability." See Rock, 819 F. Supp. 2d at 473 (emphasis added).
Further, because Wilson failed to request an accommodation following the February 4, 2011 incidents, he also cannot establish that "with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential [*11]  functions of the position," as he did not indicate what such accommodations would be. See Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n.11 (4th Cir. 2001). Nor can he demonstrate that his employer "refused to make such accommodations," as the City did not have the opportunity to refuse. See id.
In sum, although Wilson argues that he requested reasonable accommodations on three separate occasions, see Pl.'s Opp'n 28, he cannot establish a prima facie case based on any of the alleged requests. The first request, made in June 2009, is unexhausted because it did not occur within 300 days before Wilson filed his EEOC charge on February 10, 2012. See Lopez v. BMA Corp., No. DKC-13-2406, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180028, 2013 WL 6844361, at *7 (D. Md. Dec. 24, 2013). The second request, made on January 7, 2011, is not actionable because the accommodations were granted. See Rhoads, 257 F.3d at 387 n.11. Additionally, that request did not put the City on notice that Wilson had a disability for which he would need accommodations at a later date. Finally, he cannot prevail based on the third request, made on February 7, 2011, because the notice he provided of his disability did not also notify the City that he needed accommodations or request any accommodations, and consequently he cannot demonstrate that the City refused to provide reasonable accommodations.  [*12] See id.
