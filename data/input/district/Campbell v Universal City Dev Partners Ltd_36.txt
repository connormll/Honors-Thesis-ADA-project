Opinion



ORDER
This cause comes before the Court on the following filings:
1. Plaintiff Dylan Campbell's Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability (Doc. 29 ("Plaintiff's Motion")) and Defendant Universal City Development Partners, Ltd.'s response in opposition (Doc. 39); and
2. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 30 ("Defendant's Motion")) and Plaintiff's response in opposition (Doc. 37).1
Upon consideration, Plaintiff's Motion is due to be denied, and Defendant's Motion is due to be granted.

I. BACKGROUND
This case arises from Plaintiff's May 10, 2019 visit to Volcano Bay, a water amusement park operated by Defendant in Orlando, Florida, that features water amusement rides designed and manufactured by third-party ProSlide Technology, Inc. ("ProSlide"). (Doc. 28, ¶¶ 4, 6-7). That day, Plaintiff—who does not have a right forearm or a right [*2]  hand and who does not use a prosthetic—attempted to ride ProSlide's Krakatau Aqua Coaster, a raft-style water amusement ride that propels riders up via linear induction motor technology (i.e., magnetic propulsion forces) and then launches them down to water-filled channels. (Id. ¶¶ 1, 10). A Krakatau operator denied Plaintiff access because of his inability to hold the raft's handles with two hands and maintain the proper position at all times pursuant to the Volcano Bay Riders' Guide, a Florida-mandated compilation of the ridership eligibility criteria set forth in ProSlide's Operations Manuals for each water amusement ride. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 8-9, 11-21, 32). Volcano Bay managers then denied Plaintiff access to other water amusement rides under the same ProSlide-created, Defendant-enforced ridership eligibility criteria.2 (Id. ¶¶ 6, D).
Plaintiff challenges the ridership eligibility criteria denying him access to the Contested Attractions under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") (Doc. 1),3 which prohibits "the imposition or application of eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any class of individuals [*3]  with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations, unless such criteria can be shown to be necessary for the provision of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being offered." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i); see also 28 C.F.R. § 36.301(b) ("A public accommodation may impose legitimate safety requirements that are necessary for safe operation. Safety requirements must be based on actual risks and not on mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities.").4 Both parties now move for summary judgment, and the matter is ripe for review.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
To prevail on a summary judgment motion, the movant must show "that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "An issue of fact is 'material' if, under the applicable substantive law, it might affect the outcome of the case. An issue of fact is 'genuine' if the record taken as a whole could lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party." Harrison v. Culliver, 746 F.3d 1288, 1298 (11th Cir. 2014) (internal quotations omitted).
The Court must "'view the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom [*4]  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant.'" Davila v. Gladden, 777 F.3d 1198, 1203 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting Carter v. City of Melbourne, 731 F.3d 1161, 1166 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam)). "A mere 'scintilla' of evidence supporting the opposing party's position will not suffice; there must be enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party." Brooks v. Cnty. Comm'n of Jefferson Cnty., 446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990)). Summary judgment should only be granted "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).

III. DISCUSSION
The question presented here is whether Defendant can disregard ProSlide's ridership eligibility criteria for the Contested Attractions under the ADA and Florida law. (Doc. 28, ¶ 22).
Plaintiff contends that ProSlide failed to demonstrate that its ridership eligibility criteria are necessary for patron safety, as demanded under Title III of the ADA. (Doc. 29, pp. 7-23). He emphasizes that ProSlide's hazard analyses for the Contested Attractions, performed by individuals without any experience in the development of safety standards for those with limb differences, did not assess the ability of persons with one natural arm to maintain the proper position on the Contested Attractions [*5]  at all times or discern any specific risks to them. (Doc. 28, ¶¶ 23-32). Instead, relying on its own testing, the observations of and accepted parameters within the amusement park industry, and its 35-year history as a leading amusement ride designer and manufacturer, ProSlide identified general risks of patrons failing to maintain the proper riding position at all times, and the resulting Operations Manuals required patrons to possess two functioning hands or two natural arms terminating below the elbow. (Id.). Thus, Plaintiff posits that the ADA preempts Florida law to the extent it obligates Defendant to implement ProSlide's "arbitrary" ridership eligibility criteria. (Doc. 29, pp. 7-23). Plaintiff's factual arguments, and unsubstantiated conjectures in support thereof,5 are ultimately inapposite because, as Defendant correctly points out, this is a purely legal inquiry.
The necessary eligibility criteria defense established by 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i) explicitly contemplates restrictions on disabled individuals' access to places of public accommodation when such screening is essential for safety reasons, such as amusement rides. In fact, in promulgating 28 C.F.R. § 36.301(b), the Department of Justice illustrated the distinction [*6]  between "legitimate safety requirements that are necessary for safe operation" and safety requirements based on "mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities," using amusement rides as an example of the former category:
It would violate this section to establish exclusive or segregative eligibility criteria that would bar, for example, all persons who are deaf from playing on a golf course or all individuals with cerebral palsy from attending a movie theater, or limit the seating of individuals with Down's syndrome to only particular areas of a restaurant. . . . A public accommodation may, however, impose neutral rules and criteria that screen out, or tend to screen out, individuals with disabilities, if the criteria are necessary for the safe operation of the public accommodation. Examples of safety qualifications that would be justifiable in appropriate circumstances would include height requirements for certain amusement park rides or a requirement that participants in a recreational rafting expedition be able to meet a necessary level of swimming proficiency.
56 Fed. Reg. 35544, 35564 (July 26, 1991).
Equally cognizant of the "promot[ion] of patron safety in the design, construction, [*7]  assembly, disassembly, maintenance, and operation of amusement rides" within its borders, FLA. STAT. § 616.242(4) orders the Florida Department of Agriculture to adopt regulations for amusement rides that "are the same as or similar to" certain national safety standards,6 including the American Society for Testing and Materials ("ASTM") International Committee F24 Standards on Amusement Rides and Devices.7 In turn, the ASTM International Committee F24 Standards on Amusement Rides and Devices directs amusement ride operators to adhere to the manufacturer's ridership eligibility criteria. See FLA. ADMIN. CODE §§ 5J-18.0011(1), 5J-18.016; (Doc. 30-1, pp. 86-91, 98; see also Docs. 29, 30, 37, 39).8
The ADA does not preempt the Florida law and its accompanying regulations. See generally Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 565, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (2009) (explaining the preemption doctrine); Graham v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 857 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2017) (same). There is no evidence from the text of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i), specifically, or the structure of Title III, generally, that Congress meant to oust the Florida Legislature from the entire legislative field, including, as is relevant here, the regulation of patron health and safety in the amusement park setting. To the contrary, Congress expressly anticipated the need for and exempted necessary eligibility criteria, and the Department of Justice [*8]  recognized that such justifiable restrictions exist in the amusement ride context, a unique and inherently risk-laden form of entertainment. Far from standing as an obstacle to Congress' purpose of eliminating disability discrimination in places of public accommodation, the Florida regulations fit within the federal statutory scheme by using the state's historic police powers to institute a "floor" of neutral ridership eligibility criteria that the Florida Legislature deems necessary for the safe operation of amusement rides.9
Section 616.242 indicates a reasonable policy choice by the Florida Legislature: that the ASTM should be responsible for articulating what ridership eligibility criteria are necessary for the safe operation of amusement rides because the ASTM specializes in the formation and publication of technical safety standards for a variety of industries, including the amusement park industry. Likewise, the ASTM's determination that the manufacturers should evaluate this issue is reasonable because they "are in the best position" to gauge what ridership eligibility criteria are necessary for patron safety. Masci v. Six Flags Theme Park, Inc., No. 12-6585, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178666, 2014 WL 7409952, at *10 (D.N.J. Dec. 31, 2014).10
In sum, the Court does not believe that the ADA requires Defendant to reevaluate [*9]  ProSlide's ridership eligibility criteria to decide whether they are, in fact, necessary. Rather, Florida law, by adopting the ASTM's safety standards, considers ProSlide's ridership eligibility criteria necessary for the safe operation of the Contested Attractions. See id. Consequently, Defendant's compliance with ProSlide's ridership eligibility criteria under Florida law satisfies its burden to demonstrate that those criteria are necessary for the safe operation of the Contested Attractions.11

IV. CONCLUSION
For the aforementioned reasons, it is ORDERED and ADJUDGED as follows:
1. Plaintiff Dylan Campbell's Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability (Doc. 29) is DENIED.
2. Defendant Universal City Development Partners, Ltd.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 30) is GRANTED.
3. The Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to enter judgment in favor of Defendant Universal City Development Partners, Ltd., and against Plaintiff Dylan Campbell and to thereafter close the file.
DONE AND ORDERED in Orlando, Florida on February 7, 2022.
