Opinion



ORDER
Pending is the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. (Docket #22). Plaintiff has filed a response and Defendant has filed a reply. For the reasons set forth herein, the motion is GRANTED.

Facts
Plaintiff brings this action against Sonny Perdue, Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for discrimination on the basis of her disability pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §701 et seq. By order dated April 25, 2017, the Court dismissed plaintiff's claims arising under the FOIA and claims of discrimination that had been previously litigated. Plaintiff's remaining claims arise under the Rehabilitation Act and stem from training incidents which occurred in 2015.
Plaintiff Devonna Culpepper began working for the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") in Rural Development in or around February 1979. She has been hearing impaired since before [*2]  she became employed at USDA. Lawrence McCullough and Cheryl Ivy were the plaintiff's immediate supervisors the last 21 years of the plaintiff's 38 year career with USDA Rural Development. Plaintiff retired in September, 2016.
On September 1, 2015, Plaintiff, along with other employees, received an email regarding TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosures Training, Part 2, which was scheduled for September 2, 2015. The training was prepared by ReadyTalk. A copy of the power point slide presentation was provided with the email. Plaintiff informed Ivy on September 3, 2015 that closed captioning had not been available on September 2, 2015. This was Plaintiff's first contact with Ivy regarding the September training. On December 7, 2015, Plaintiff, along with other employees, received an email from Pam Fleharty regarding SFH electronic customer file training scheduled for December 9, 2015. Prior to the training, Plaintiff asked Ivy about closed captioning for this training and Ivy contacted the national office and learned that no closed captioning was available. Ivy provided Plaintiff with speaker notes and a power point presentation for the training.
There were no positions to apply for at USDA [*3]  after the December 9, 2015 training. Plaintiff did not apply for any other positions with USDA after this training. Plaintiff has not applied for a position at USDA since June 1, 2015. Plaintiff was not demoted after the December 2015 training and received a pay increase in January 2016. No new positions came open before Plaintiff retired.
In 2015, Plaintiff completed six trainings on AgLearn which included text and audio. In 2016 she completed nineteen trainings on AgLearn all of which included text. For live statewide trainings for USDA or Rural Development, USDA would hire an interpreter for Plaintiff.
Plaintiff complains that USDA failed to comply with Section 508 by failing to provide closed captioning for all trainings. Plaintiff further complains that training was advantageous to an employee and the failure to receive certain training could impede the employee's ability to receive promotions. Plaintiff claims to have been excluded from thirteen other training opportunities from July 31, 2015 to August 19, 2016 because she was not made aware of the training events. Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim and her failure to accommodate [*4]  claim.

Standard for Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact, so that the dispute may be decided solely on legal grounds. Holloway v. Lockhart, 813 F.2d 874 (8th Cir. 1987); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. The Supreme Court has established guidelines to assist trial courts in determining whether this standard has been met:
The inquiry performed is the threshold inquiry of determining whether there is the need for a trial -- whether, in other words, there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has cautioned that summary judgment should be invoked carefully so that no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of disputed factual issues. Inland Oil & Transport Co. v. United States, 600 F.2d 725 (8th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 991 (1979). The Eighth Circuit set out the burden of the parties in connection with a summary judgment motion in Counts v. M.K. Ferguson Co., 862 F.2d 1338 (8th Cir. 1988):
[T]he burden on the moving party for summary judgment is only to demonstrate, i.e., '[to] point out to the District Court,' that the record does not disclose a genuine dispute on a material fact. It is enough for the movant to bring up the fact that the record does not contain such an issue and to identify [*5]  that part of the record which bears out his assertion. Once this is done, his burden is discharged, and, if the record in fact bears out the claim that no genuine dispute exists on any material fact, it is then the respondent's burden to set forth affirmative evidence, specific facts, showing that there is a genuine dispute on that issue. If the respondent fails to carry that burden, summary judgment should be granted.
Id. at 1339 (quoting City of Mt. Pleasant v. Associated Elec. Coop., 838 F.2d 268, 273-274 (8th Cir. 1988) (citations omitted)(brackets in original)). Only disputes over facts that may affect the outcome of the suit under governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has made clear that "[t]here is no 'discrimination case exception' to the application of summary judgment, which is a useful pretrial tool to determine whether any case, including one alleging discrimination, merits a trial." Togerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031, 1043 (8th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).

Discussion
This action is governed by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 701, et seq. "To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment on the basis of disability, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she was disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act; (2) she was qualified with or without reasonable accommodation [*6]  to do the essential functions of the position in question; and (3) she suffered an adverse employment action solely because of her disability. Culpepper v. Dep't of Agric., No. 4:06CV00180 JWC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67824, 2010 WL 2757245, at *3 (E.D. Ark. July 7, 2010), aff'd sub nom. Culpepper v. Vilsack, 664 F.3d 252 (8th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). The first two elements are not at issue in this lawsuit.
"An adverse employment action is one that causes a material change in the terms or conditions of employment." Brown v. Lester E. Cox Med. Ctrs., 286 F.3d 1040, 1045 (8th Cir.2002) (citations omitted). To be "adverse," the action need not always involve termination or even a decrease in benefits or pay. Phillips v. Collings, 256 F.3d 843, 847 (8th Cir.2001). However, "not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action." Buboltz v. Residential Advantages, Inc., 523 F.3d 864, 868 (8th Cir. 2008), abrogated by Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031 (8th Cir. 2011) quoting, Montandon v. Farmland Industries, Inc., 116 F.3d 355, 359 (8th Cir.1997). "A materially adverse action must be 'more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.' There must be a material change in employment status-a reduction in title, salary, or benefits." Wenzel v. Missouri-American Water Co., 404 F.3d 1038, 1042 (8th Cir.2005) citations omitted.
Plaintiff argues that the Defendant failed to make training available to her thereby preventing her advancement in Rural Development. However, it is undisputed that Plaintiff has not applied for a promotion or advancement since June, 2015, prior to the trainings about which she claims the Defendant failed to provide appropriate [*7]  accommodations and prior to the thirteen other training events from which she claims to have been excluded. In the context of a failure-to-promote claim, "a plaintiff must show that she qualified and applied for an available position, she was rejected, and a similarly situated employee who is not a member of the plaintiff's protected group was promoted instead." Culpepper v. Dep't of Agric., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67824, 2010 WL 2757245, at 6. Plaintiff has presented no evidence that she applied for any position for which she was rejected. Additionally, there were no positions available for which Plaintiff could apply after the December 2015 training. To the extent Plaintiff is claiming that her retirement in 2016 arises to constructive discharge, Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to support her claim. "A constructive discharge occurs 'when an employer deliberately renders [an] employee's working conditions intolerable,' forcing him to quit his job. An objective standard applies to constructive discharge claims, i.e., a constructive discharge takes place only when a reasonable person would find working conditions intolerable." Buboltz v. Residential Advantages, Inc., 523 F.3d at 869, citations omitted. Plaintiff has offered no evidence that the Defendant acted deliberately to make her employment conditions [*8]  intolerable. Plaintiff admits that she retired in September 2016 because she was told it was the best time to retire. The failure to provide closed captioning for the training events in September and December, 2015 does not rise to the level that a reasonable person would find the working conditions intolerable. Further, "[a] denial of training or a denial of sick leave, without more, is not an actionable adverse employment action. Culpepper 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67824, 2010 WL 2757245, at *18.
As explained in Plaintiff's previous litigation:
Failure to accommodate is a separate form of prohibited discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. Buboltz, 523 F.3d at 870. Such discrimination occurs if "a covered entity [does] not ... make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a); accord Peebles, 354 F.3d at 766; Ballard v. Rubin, 284 F.3d 957, 960 (8th Cir.2002). If an employee requests an accommodation, the employer must engage in an interactive process to determine whether reasonable accommodations are possible. Buboltz, 523 F.3d at 870. If such accommodations are possible, the employer must reasonably accommodate the employee's request, but not [*9]  necessarily the exact accommodation requested. Id.
Culpepper v. Dep't of Agric., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67824, 2010 WL 2757245, at 3. Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability by failing to provide closed captioning for the training events in September and December 2015. Based upon the undisputed facts, Plaintiff received notice of trainings on September 1, 2015 and December 7, 2015 for trainings to be held on September 2, 2015 and December 9, 2015. Both of the trainings were created by the vendor ReadyTalk. For the particular vendor, closed captioning services must be requested 72 hours prior to the event in order to guarantee the availability of a caption operator. Because of the short notice of the training events, closed captioning was not available. Defendant provided Plaintiff with the power point presentation for the September training and the power point presentation and speaker notes for the December training. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that these accommodations were not reasonable. See, Culpepper, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67824, 2010 WL 2757245, at 24 (finding that by providing speaker notes defendant demonstrated a good faith effort to assist in obtaining accommodations). Further, the failure to provide closed captioning for the training events did not rise to the level of an actionable [*10]  adverse employment action. Id. See also, Schaffhauser v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 794 F.3d 899, 905 (8th Cir. 2015)( to succeed on a failure to accommodate claim, a plaintiff must establish both a prima facie case of discrimination based on disability and a failure to accommodate it).
For these reasons, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
IT IS SO ORDERED this 22nd day of May, 2018.
