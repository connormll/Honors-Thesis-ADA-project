Opinion



MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Patricia Anne Ordonez Belcher brought this action on September 11, 2017, seeking review of the final decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration determining she was not disabled. (D.E. 1). On February 2, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Brief in Support of Claim, which is construed as a Motion for Summary Judgment. (D.E. 12). On April 13, 2018, Defendant filed a Responsive Brief.1 For the reasons that follow, it is respectfully recommended that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment be DENIED, the Commissioner's determination be AFFIRMED, and Plaintiff's cause of action be DISMISSED.

I. JURISDICTION
The Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g).

II. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff protectively filed her initial claims for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income [*2]  on November 15, 2013, alleging a disability onset date of January 13, 2013, due to severe generalized body pain, left hand tingling and numbness, back, right hip, and right knee pain, pain-induced insomnia, chronic fatigue, spine irregularities, severe arthropathies, and severe asthma. (D.E. 9-4, Page 5); (D.E. 9-8, Page 83). Upon initial consideration and reconsideration in February and May of 2014, Plaintiff's applications were denied. (D.E. 9-4, Page 5). At Plaintiff's request, a hearing was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) on February 10, 2016, at which Plaintiff, a medical expert (ME), and a vocational expert (VE) testified. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 5, 31-85). Plaintiff filed several objections to the VE's testimony on February 29, 2016. (D.E. 9-9, Pages 2-8). On March 29, 2016, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision, finding Plaintiff is not disabled. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 5-18). The ALJ's determination was made the final decision of the Commissioner under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) after the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review on June 8, 2017. (D.E. 9-3, Pages 2-6). Plaintiff timely filed this complaint on September 11, 2017, seeking review of the Commissioner's final decision. (D.E. [*3]  1). The undersigned has reviewed the entire record.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Judicial review of the Commissioner's denial of social security benefits is limited under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) to determine (1) whether the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence, and (2) whether the Commissioner applied the relevant legal standard. Newton v. Apfel, 209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir. 2000). Substantial evidence is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S. Ct. 1420, 28 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1971); Greenspan v. Shalala, 38 F.3d 232, 237 (5th Cir. 1994). The burden of evidence is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance. Newton, 209 F.3d at 452. The court will not reweigh the evidence, try the issues de novo, or substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner's. Masterson v. Barnhart, 309 F.3d 267, 272, 48 Fed. Appx. 481 (5th Cir. 2002).
Four factors will be taken into account in the Court's evaluation of the record in applying the substantial evidence standard: (1) objective medical evidence; (2) diagnoses and opinions of examining physicians; (3) subjective evidence of claimant's pain and disability; and (4) claimant's age, education, and work history. Wren v. Sullivan, 925 F.2d 123, 126 (5th Cir. 1991) (citations omitted).
The Commissioner's evaluation of a disability claim follows a five-step process to determine whether: (1) the claimant is currently working or engaging in substantial gainful activity; (2) the claimant's [*4]  ability to work is severely impaired; (3) claimant's impairment meets or equals an impairment listed in the regulations appendix; (4) claimant's impairment prevents her from performing past work; and (5) if unable to perform previous work due to inadequate residual functional capacity (RFC), claimant can perform other work considering her age, education, work experience, and RFC. Bowling v. Shalala, 36 F.3d 431, 435 (5th Cir. 1994). At any point in the five-step process, a finding of disabled or not disabled terminates the Commissioner's analysis. Id. For the first four steps, the burden of proof rests with the claimant. Id. At Step Five, the burden of proof shifts to the Commissioner to show claimant can perform other substantial work within the national economy. Masterson, 309 F.3d at 272. At this point, the burden of proof returns to the claimant to rebut the Commissioner's showing. Id.

IV. ISSUES PRESENTED AND SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE

A. The ALJ's Determination
The ALJ issued his unfavorable decision on March 29, 2016. (D.E. 9-4, Page 18). At Step One, he found claimant had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since January 13, 2013. (D.E. 9-4, Page 7). At Step Two, the ALJ found claimant's ability to work was limited by the following severe impairments: [*5]  asthma, discogenic and degenerative spine disease (cervical and lumbar), degenerative joint disease of the hip and knee, and muscle and joint pain with malaise. (D.E. 9-4, Page 8). The ALJ considered claimant not entirely credible regarding other medically determinable impairments based on objective medical evidence and the ME's testimony. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 11-15). At Step Three, the ALJ found that none of claimant's impairments or combination of impairments met or equaled an impairment listed in the regulations appendix. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 9-10). The ALJ further concluded at Step Four that claimant was unable to perform any past relevant work due to her impairments. (D.E. 9-4, Page 15). Finally, at Step Five, the ALJ found jobs existed in the national economy for an individual with claimant's RFC. (D.E. 9-4, Page 16). The ALJ provided an illustrative list of other available work claimant would be able to perform including cashier, mail clerk, and parking lot attendant. (D.E. 9-4, Page 16).

B. Issues Presented
Plaintiff asserts the ALJ harmfully erred by failing to discuss all objections in his decision despite an obligation to do so. (D.E. 12, Pages 4-6). Plaintiff further alleges the [*6]  ALJ erred in finding Plaintiff was not disabled as a matter of law because the number of available light, unskilled jobs based on Plaintiff's RFC was significantly reduced. (D.E. 12, Pages 10-13). Lastly, Plaintiff claims the ALJ's credibility finding was flawed because he failed to consider Plaintiff's work history. (D.E. 12, Pages 15-18).
For the reasons stated below, the undersigned recommends these arguments are without merit and the ALJ's determination Plaintiff is not disabled is supported by substantial evidence.

C. Summary of the Evidence
A hearing was held before the ALJ on February 10, 2016, at which Plaintiff, the ME, and the VE testified. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 31-164). At the time, Plaintiff was a 52-year-old high school graduate with some college. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 31-32). Plaintiff testified she had a variety of health problems which severely limited her ability to work, including back, neck, shoulder, leg, knee, wrist, and arm pain, headaches, dizziness, asthma, allergies to "everything," fibromyalgia, major depressive disorder, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, memory loss, and carpal tunnel. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 37-53). The ME, in his testimony, stated his belief Plaintiff [*7]  could perform work at a light level. (D.E. 9-4, Page 60). The ME further indicated in his testimony that, despite Plaintiff having been prescribed a walker by her doctor, he did not believe one was necessary based on Plaintiff's medical record. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 67-68). He opined Plaintiff's doctors were basing their diagnoses and prescriptions on Plaintiff's complaints instead of the objective medical evidence. (D.E. 9-4, Page 72). In the ALJ's examination of the VE, the VE stated she believed somebody with Plaintiff's RFC could perform work as a cashier, ticket seller, or mail clerk and provided estimates of the numbers of these jobs available. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 74-75, 78). The ALJ clarified the VE had factored Plaintiff's limitations into the VE's job availability numbers. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 74-75). The ALJ further clarified the VE relied on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and her professional experience to estimate the number of available jobs. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 77-78).
On February 29, 2016, Plaintiff submitted to the ALJ five objections: (1) the VE was not qualified to estimate job availability numbers; (2) the VE's estimates of job availability were inadequately supported; [*8]  (3) the jobs the VE suggested could be performed by Plaintiff are no longer unskilled based on data collection methods from the BLS; (4) reliance on a sit/stand option as the basis for a Step Five denial is in violation of Social Security Ruling (SSR) 00-1c, 2000 SSR LEXIS 1, 2000 WL 38896 because a sit/stand option is a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and (5) an unfavorable decision should not be issued before Plaintiff has an opportunity to address these objections at a supplemental hearing. (D.E. 9-9, Pages 2-7).
The ALJ issued an unfavorable decision on March 29, 2016. (D.E. 9-4, Page 2). In his analysis, the ALJ thoroughly referenced Plaintiff's medical records from her treating physicians. He cited the good prognosis in April 2013 by Dr. Nicole Lopez, who found there was no reason Plaintiff could not return to work. (D.E. 9-4, Page 9). The ALJ also noted Plaintiff appeared to have a normal gait and no difficulty walking for most of the time after the alleged onset of her disability. (D.E. 9-4, Page 11). When considering the medical record, the ALJ referenced two separate medical examinations from July 2013. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 12-13). At the first examination, Dr. Johnnie [*9]  Fisher observed Plaintiff walked with a limp, was clearly in discomfort while rising from her chair, and she would be unlikely to return to work.2 (D.E. 9-4, Pages 12-13). However, at a visit to a separate doctor later that same month, Dr. Terry Eska observed Plaintiff walk on her toes, squat, perform deep knee bends, rise without assistance, and her deep tendon reflexes were noted as normal. (D.E. 9-4, Page 13). The ALJ referenced Dr. Eska's observation that Plaintiff's every musculoskeletal motion was accompanied by a "dramatic display of moaning and grimacing and hyperventilation." (D.E. 9-4, Page 13).
The ALJ noted that, in October and December 2013, Dr. Raymond Reese described Plaintiff as having a history of fibromyalgia but felt well with minor complaints on multiple occasions. (D.E. 9-4, Page 13). The ALJ then cited that, in Plaintiff's May 2015 visit to the ER complaining of lower extremity pain, she had allowed her pain medication to lapse for weeks and had normal sensory, reflex, and motor responses. (D.E. 9-4, Page 13). Next, the ALJ referenced Plaintiff's November 2015 ER visit, highlighting medical staff had noted Plaintiff had no difficulty walking and no joint or neck [*10]  pain. (D.E. 9-4, Page 13). The ALJ notes that, despite this, Plaintiff was prescribed a walker and handicapped placard in January 2016 by Dr. Reese. (D.E. 9-4, Page 13). For Plaintiff's alleged severe asthma, the ALJ referenced normal pulmonary function test results in September 2011 and July 2012 with a single episode of wheezing asthma in November 2015 after Plaintiff ran out of her prescribed medications. (D.E. 9-4, Page 13).
Based on the above evidence and the ME's testimony, the ALJ found Plaintiff's claims of intense, persistent, and limiting effects of her symptoms not entirely credible. (D.E. 9-4, Page 14). Thus, the RFC determined by ALJ was that of unskilled, light work as defined in CFR 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) with pulmonary restrictions, an allowance for a break from sitting every 30 minutes by standing for an appropriate time, use of a walker to ambulate, and no more than frequent handling, grasping, and fingering. (D.E. 9-4, Page 11). Based on the VE's testimony, the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) estimates from the BLS, and the Plaintiff's determined RFC, the ALJ found available jobs Plaintiff could perform existing in the national economy such as cashier, mail clerk, and parking [*11]  lot attendant. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 16-17). An estimated 19,900 of these jobs exist in Texas, resulting in the ALJ's finding of a significant number of available jobs Plaintiff could perform. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 16-17). The ALJ stated the VE used a DOT code, professional experience, and recent sources to give updated job numbers at the hearing. (D.E. 9-4, Page 17).

V. ANALYSIS

A. The ALJ Adequately Addressed Plaintiff's Objections
After Plaintiff's hearing before the ALJ, Plaintiff objected to use of the jobs identified by the VE at Step Five of the analysis because they allegedly included a sit/stand accommodation. (D.E. 9-9, Page 5). Plaintiff alleges the ALJ erred by failing to adequately address or rule upon this objection, and this error was harmful because, according to Plaintiff, job options with a sit/stand accommodation cannot be the basis for a Step Five denial under the ADA. Therefore, Plaintiff argues she should have been determined disabled as a matter of law. (D.E. 12, Pages 4-6).
The Hearings, Appeals and Litigation Law Manual (HALLEX) § I-2-6-74(B) (June 16, 2016)3 states, "the ALJ must (on the record): [r]ule on any objection(s). The ALJ may address the objection(s) on the record during the hearing, in narrative form as a separate exhibit, or [*12]  in the body of his or her decision." There is no dispute that Plaintiff's first, second, third, and fifth objections4 were adequately addressed by the ALJ in his decision.5 The undersigned recommends the ALJ also addressed Plaintiff's fourth objection6 in his explanation of the methodology when he arrived at his conclusion, focusing on the information he elicited from the VE during her testimony. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 17-18).
Alternatively, even if Plaintiff's fourth objection was not adequately addressed, which would be an error per HALLEX § I-2-6-74(B), this error was harmless and therefore does not justify remand. Audler v. Astrue, 501 F.3d 446, 448 (5th Cir. 2007); Mays v. Bowen, 837 F.2d 1362, 1364 (5th Cir. 1988) (unless a party's "substantial rights" have been affected, "procedural perfection in administrative proceedings is not required"); see (D.E. 9-4, Pages 7-18). In her fourth objection, Plaintiff asserted the jobs provided by the ALJ in a Step Five analysis may not include accommodated work.7 (D.E. 12, Page 7). The undersigned recommends Plaintiff's argument is without merit because the ALJ did not include accommodated work in the jobs listed, likely because reasonable accommodations are not taken into account when an ALJ is determining whether a person is disabled. Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 803, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999) ("when the SSA determines whether [*13]  an individual is disabled for SSDI purposes, it does not take the possibility of 'reasonable accommodation' into account"). The ADA and the Social Security Act are two separate acts with two separate standards and objectives. See, e.g., Swanks v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 116 F.3d 582, 583, 325 U.S. App. D.C. 238 (D.C. Cir. 1997). The ADA mandates employers reasonably accommodate the needs of otherwise disabled employees, while the Social Security Act provides benefits when individuals, due to their disability, cannot perform work existing in the national economy. Id. The Social Security Act does not reference reasonable accommodation. Id. As such, the "reasonable accommodation" language contained in the ADA has no bearing on the ALJ's analysis in a social security hearing.
When the ALJ questioned the VE on an employee's ability to sit or stand during the workday in the jobs she listed, he did so to determine if it was a normal part of the job consistent across all employers, not as a reasonable accommodation. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 74-78). The ALJ's burden was to provide jobs existing in the national economy a person with Plaintiff's RFC could perform without requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations—a burden he satisfied. The ALJ confirmed with the VE that the job [*14]  numbers provided included only those which, by their nature, allow for a break from sitting every 30 minutes. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 17, 75). He properly ignored any consideration of reasonable accommodation as used in the ADA. Therefore, the undersigned recommends the ALJ addressed Plaintiff's objections or, alternatively, the undersigned recommends the ALJ's error was harmless as the analysis was not affected by the unaddressed objection.

B. The ALJ Applied the Correct Legal Standard
Plaintiff next asserts the ALJ's Step Five analysis was flawed because he did not follow the Medical-Vocational Guidelines in finding Plaintiff not disabled. (D.E. 12, Pages 9-15). Specifically, Plaintiff claims the Grid Rules8 directed by SSR 83-12, 1983 SSR LEXIS 329
However, the undersigned recommends the ALJ correctly applied the law. The Fifth Circuit has "recognized that the DOT is not comprehensive, in that it cannot and does not purport to include each and every specific skill or qualification for a particular job." Carey v. Apfel, 230 F.3d 131, 145 (5th Cir. 2000). Alongside the Grid Rules, SSR 83-12, 1983 SSR LEXIS 32 also advises VE assistance when a claimant's RFC lies between two exertional ranges—in this case between light and sedentary. SSR 83-12, 1983 SSR LEXIS 32, 1983 WL 31253, at *3. The VE may give recommendations on a claimant's ability "to [*15]  perform substantial numbers of occupations within the range of work at issue; identify jobs which are within the RFC, if they exist; and provide a statement of the incidence of such jobs in the region in which the person lives or in several regions of the country." Id. This is precisely the information the ALJ elicited from the VE. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 73-79). The ALJ solicited this testimony because Plaintiff "suffered from additional impairments which potentially precluded [her] from performing a significant number of light, unskilled jobs, and made the application of [the Grid Rules] inappropriate." Carey, 230 F.3d at 146 ("The Commissioners must rely upon the services of a vocational expert or similar evidence" when the Grid Rules do not apply). This is the case even if the VE's testimony conflicts with the job requirements as listed in the DOT because "DOT job descriptions should not be given a role that is exclusive of more specific [VE] testimony with respect to the effect of an individual claimant's limitations on his or her ability to perform a particular job." Id. When the VE's testimony and the DOT conflict, "the ALJ may rely upon the [VE's] testimony provided that the record reflects an adequate [*16]  basis for doing so." Id. In Carey, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the ALJ's decision to deny benefits to a man with one arm because the VE had testified claimant could perform work as a ticket seller or cashier despite the VE's testimony being indirectly in conflict with the DOT descriptions of these jobs. Id. at 145. In the present case, the ALJ similarly asked the VE to list jobs a person with Plaintiff's RFC could perform and found these jobs could be done by Plaintiff despite an indirect conflict with the DOT descriptions. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 74-75, 78). Therefore, the undersigned recommends the ALJ properly relied upon the VE's testimony.
Plaintiff also claims her RFC does not permit her to perform light work as described in 20 C.F.R. 404.1567(b) because of her need to use a walker to ambulate. (D.E. 12, Pages 13-15). Plaintiff cites SSR 83-10, 1983 SSR LEXIS 30,10 highlighting that a job is categorized as light work "when it requires a good deal of walking or standing" and, due to Plaintiff's need for a walker to ambulate, she cannot perform a full range of light work. SSR 83-10, 1983 SSR LEXIS 30, 1983 WL 31251, at *5; (D.E. 12, Pages 14-15).
This argument is not persuasive because the ALJ did not claim Plaintiff could perform a full range of light work. Rather, he relied on the VE's testimony to provide a list of jobs falling within the light categorization a person with Plaintiff's RFC could perform. (D.E. 9-4, Page 16). The ALJ took into account the Plaintiff's need for a walker to ambulate, even though he also cited to evidence which indicated it may not be necessary. (D.E. 9-4, Page 11). Based on the VE's testimony, the ALJ found available work existing in substantial numbers within the [*18]  national economy such as cashier, mail clerk, and parking lot attendant which Plaintiff could perform, thereby satisfying the burden at Step Five. (D.E. 9-4, Page 16). Therefore, the undersigned recommends the ALJ's decision was based on the proper legal standard and is supported by substantial evidence.

C. The ALJ's Credibility Finding Was Proper
Plaintiff's last objection is that the ALJ erred in failing to consider Plaintiff's work history when making his credibility determination. (D.E. 12, Pages 15-18). Considerable deference is given to the ALJ in determining a claimant's credibility. See Wren, 925 F.2d at 128. The ALJ is to consider: (1) objective medical evidence; (2) physician diagnoses; (3) subjective evidence of pain; and (4) the claimant's age, education, and work history. DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92, 94 (5th Cir. 1972). "Implicit credibility findings" may be determined substantial supporting evidence because an ALJ makes decisions "based on all of the evidence before him." Haywood v. Sullivan, 888 F.2d 1463, 1471 (5th Cir. 1989). The ALJ does not need "to mechanically follow every guiding regulatory factor in articulating reasons for denying claims or weighing credibility." Clary v. Barnhart, 214 F. App'x 479, 482 (5th Cir. 2007). If the ALJ provides an adequate narrative discussion explaining the basis behind his reasoning, he need not address every [*19]  factor. See, e.g., Bryant v. Astrue, 272 F. App'x 352, 356 (5th Cir. 2008).
Even though the ALJ did not explicitly mention Plaintiff's work history, he provided an adequate narrative discussion. The ALJ referenced the ME's testimony, Plaintiff's testimony, and physicians' notes from Plaintiff's visits to multiple doctors. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 12-15). Plaintiff's claims of severe, limiting pain were repeatedly contrasted with observations of functionality as described by Plaintiff's treating physicians. (D.E. 9-4, Pages 13-14). The ALJ also found persuasive the ME's opinion testimony that Plaintiff was not as limited as she claimed based on Plaintiff's medical record. (D.E. 9-4, Page 15). Because the ALJ's discussion adequately supported his credibility finding, the undersigned recommends Plaintiff's final argument is without merit.

VI. RECOMMENDATION
The undersigned recommends the ALJ's decision that Plaintiff is not disabled is supported by substantial evidence and the ALJ applied the relevant legal standard correctly when reaching this decision.
Therefore, for the reasons stated above, it is respectfully recommended Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment be DENIED, the Commissioner's determination be AFFIRMED, and Plaintiff's cause of action [*20]  be DISMISSED.
ORDERED this 22nd day of June, 2018.
