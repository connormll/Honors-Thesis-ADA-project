Opinion



NON-FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Kinsey Gober brings this action against her former employer, Defendant Newton County Board of Health, asserting claims of disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and retaliation in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1996, 29 U.S.C. 2691, et seq. (FMLA), as amended by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, 29 C.F.R. § 826.20 (FFCRA). (Doc. 1). This matter is before the Court for consideration of Defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint. (Doc. 4). For the reasons discussed below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the motion to dismiss, (Doc. 4), be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff filed suit against Defendant on April 20, 2021. (Doc. 1). The Court draws the following factual allegations from the complaint, which are assumed to be true for [*2]  the purpose of this discussion.
Plaintiff began working for Defendant in December of 2004 as a Customer Service Representative. Id. at ¶¶ 14-16. Plaintiff suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and anxiety, which impacts her major life activities, including the ability to walk, eat, bend, and care for herself. Id. at ¶¶ 17-18. Her disabilities also implicate her digestion and circulation. Id.
On or about March 19, 2020, Plaintiff texted her supervisor, Robin Broach, and told her that she needed the next day off from work. Id. at ¶ 24. Plaintiff inquired whether she qualified for leave due to her disability, expressing that doctors did not want her working where she could be exposed to COVID-19. Id. at ¶¶ 24, 26. During that conversation, Ms. Broach stated that she did not believe that there was any available leave and directed Plaintiff to contact Thomas Gibson, the Director of Human Resources. Id. at ¶¶ 25, 27. A few days later, Mr. Gibson emailed Defendant's staff stating that if an employee fell under the criteria listed in Governor Brian Kemp's Executive Order, then the employee could remain at home. Id. at ¶ 29. On the same day, Plaintiff's rheumatologist wrote a note, a copy of which [*3]  Plaintiff provided to Defendant, stating that Plaintiff's immunosuppressed state required her to remain home for two weeks. Id. at ¶¶ 30, 31.
On or about April 20, 2020, Dr. Arona, Defendant's District Health Director and CEO, stated that Defendant's employees were to return to work on April 22, and Plaintiff complied by coming back to work. Id. at ¶¶ 32, 34. That same day, Plaintiff began experiencing headaches, nausea, and vomiting, and Plaintiff's mother contacted Ms. Broach the next day about her worsening symptoms. Id. at ¶¶ 35, 36. Ms. Broach advised Plaintiff to rest and come in later in the day if she felt better. Id. at ¶ 36. Plaintiff returned to work the next day, April 23, for fear of losing her job—Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Broach threatened that Plaintiff would be terminated if she did not work her regular schedule. Id. at ¶¶ 37, 38. Plaintiff provided another doctor's note to Ms. Broach stating that she needed to be out of work until April 27, 2020. Id. at ¶ 39.
After Plaintiff returned to work, Ms. Broach notified Plaintiff that she had been assigned by Jean Frazier, the Nurse Director, to a specimen point of collection site for training and that Plaintiff would then [*4]  work at a COVID-19 testing site the following week. Id. at ¶ 40. Plaintiff expressed her hesitation with this assignment due to her disability. Id. at ¶ 41. That same day, Ms. Frazier approached Plaintiff about her assignment, and Plaintiff again expressed concern. Id. at ¶ 43. Ms. Frazier directed Plaintiff to contact the Human Resources Generalist, Melanie O'Steen. Id. at ¶ 44. Plaintiff alleges that, shortly thereafter, Ms. Broach informed her "that she did not have a choice and must report" to the site. Id. at ¶¶ 44, 45. Plaintiff again expressed her hesitation about working at the site, and Ms. Frazier responded that Plaintiff would be safer at the testing site than anywhere else. Id. at ¶46. Ms. Frazier contacted Mr. Gibson about the situation, and Defendant subsequently terminated Plaintiff's employment. Id. at ¶¶ 47, 48.
On June 19, 2020, Plaintiff "filed a discrimination claim for disability and retaliation" with the Equal Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and on January 20, 2021, the EEOC issued Plaintiff a notice of dismissal letter and notice of right to sue. Id. at ¶¶ 10, 12.

II. MOTION TO DISMISS AND PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSE
Defendant filed its motion to dismiss the complaint under [*5]  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) on July 6, 2021. (Doc. 4). Defendant moves to dismiss the entire complaint with prejudice. Id. at 2.
Defendant first argues that the Eleventh Amendment bars all of Plaintiff's ADA and FMLA claims because they are purely for monetary damages. Id. at 11-16. Defendant maintains that Eleventh Amendment immunity applies to it as an "arm of the State." Id. at 12. Defendant argues that it was subject to the tight control of the State of Georgia regarding the COVID-19 response, noting that it was required to staff testing and screening services under the direction of the Georgia Department of Health, a state agency. Id. at 13. Defendant argues that it could not "adopt or make rules or regulations that contradict those issued by the Georgia Department of Health." Id. at 14.
On the merits, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to allege facts sufficient to make out an ADA disparate treatment claim. Id. at 16-18. Defendant argues that Plaintiff merely recites "threadbare legal conclusions" and does not plausibly allege disability discrimination through any "direct or circumstantial facts." Id. at 17. Defendant also argues that the complaint lacks factual allegations to support a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA, as [*6]  Plaintiff fails to allege "any facts showing that she sought a reasonable accommodation" or "how any such accommodation would allow her to perform the essential functions of her position." Id. at 18-21. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's expressions of "hesitation" about the testing site do not satisfy the requirement to identify "the specific need for accommodation" and that Plaintiff's failure to identify her job duties and "how her unstated accommodation would facilitate her performance of the essential functions of the position" could not have put Defendant on notice of its obligations under the ADA. Id. at 20. Next, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to state a plausible claim for ADA retaliation because she does not identify how she engaged in a protected activity or expression, or how that protected activity caused her termination. Id. at 21-22.
Finally, Defendant argues that, even if any of Plaintiff's claims survive, Plaintiff cannot seek punitive damages under the ADA or FMLA because Defendant is a governmental entity. Id. at 22-23.
Plaintiff responded to the motion to dismiss and first argues that her claims under the ADA and FMLA are not barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity because Defendant [*7]  was not acting as an "arm of the State," but rather as an independent county entity. (Doc. 5 at 4). Plaintiff argues that, under Georgia law, each county of the State has its own board of health, which has the power to develop and implement its own rules and regulations in matters pertaining to health in the county. Id. at 4-5. Plaintiff argues that even in implementing COVID-19 policies, Defendant was still acting as an independent county entity. Id. at 5.
Plaintiff also argues that her claims for disability discrimination and failure to accommodate include all of the necessary elements and survive the motion to dismiss. Id. at 6-9. She argues that any issues about the reasonableness of the accommodation are "questions of fact for the parties to explore in later phases of litigation and not to be disposed of through a motion to dismiss." Id. at 8. Plaintiff argues that she alleges facts showing that she sought a reasonable accommodation in the form of a medical leave of absence on March 19, 2020, that she "repeatedly requested to not be placed at the specimen point of collection site or the COVID-19 testing site due to her disability," and that in both scenarios "Defendant failed to [*8]  engage in the interactive process." Id. at 9. As for retaliation, Plaintiff argues that she engaged in statutorily protected activity when she requested accommodations and raised her concerns, that Defendant took adverse employment action against her by terminating her employment, and that a causal link exists between the two. Id. at 10. Defendant filed a reply, (Doc. 9), and the matter is now ripe for review.

III. DISCUSSION

A. Standards on a Motion to Dismiss
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a complaint to contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). While a plaintiff need not include "detailed factual allegations" in the complaint, the requirement to demonstrate the grounds for relief "requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). In other words, Rule 8 requires "more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Instead, to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint "must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). "A [*9]  claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id.
These standards suggest a two-pronged approach for courts evaluating a motion to dismiss a complaint. See id. at 678-79; Am. Dental Ass'n v. Cigna Corp., 605 F.3d 1283, 1290 (11th Cir. 2010). First, "eliminate any allegations in the complaint that are merely legal conclusions." Am. Dental Ass'n, 605 F.3d at 1290. While a court must accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, Powell v. Thomas, 643 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir. 2011), it need not consider "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements," Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Nor should it consider "a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation." Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986). Second, "where there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief." Am. Dental Ass'n, 605 F.3d at 1290 (internal quotation marks omitted).

B. Eleventh Amendment Immunity
Defendant argues that the county board of health is an "arm of the State" such that Eleventh Amendment immunity bars all of Plaintiff's claims in this case. (Doc. 4 at 11-16). Plaintiff responds that Defendant is not an arm of the State and thus not entitled to immunity. (Doc. [*10]  5 at 4-6).
"[A]bsent waiver by the State or valid congressional override, the Eleventh Amendment bars a damages action against a State in federal court." Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 169, 105 S. Ct. 3099, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985).1 And "Eleventh Amendment immunity extends not only to the state itself, but also to state officers and entities when they act as an arm of the state." Lightfoot v. Henry Cnty. Sch. Dist., 771 F.3d 764, 768 (11th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). "It does not, however, extend to counties, municipal corporations, or similar political subdivisions of the state." Id.
This Court considers four factors to determine whether an entity is an "arm of the State" in carrying out a particular function: (1) how state law defines the entity; (2) what degree of control the State maintains over the entity; (3) where the entity derives its funds; and (4) who is responsible for judgments against the entity. Manders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir. 2003) (en banc). These factors must be assessed "in light of the particular function in which the defendant was engaged when taking the actions out of which liability is asserted to arise." Id. at 1308; see also Shands Teaching Hosp. & Clinics v. Beech St. Corp., 208 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir. 2000) ("The pertinent inquiry is not into the nature of [an entity's] status in the abstract, but its function or role in a particular context."). "The entity invoking Eleventh Amendment immunity bears the burden of demonstrating that the [four] factors weigh [*11]  in its favor." Miller v. Advantage Behav. Health Sys., 677 F. App'x 556, 559 (11th Cir. 2017).
As noted above, before delving into each of the factors, the Court must first identify the relevant context. Id. Here, Plaintiff's ADA and FMLA discrimination claims arise from her allegedly unlawful termination. Thus, the Court must determine whether Defendant acts as an arm of the State in making personnel decisions, such as hiring and firing, when conducting the four-factor analysis. See id. (noting that for a discrimination claim, the question is whether the defendant "acts as an arm of the State in making hiring and firing decisions").
The first question is how state law defines the entity. This analysis allows the Court to look to the Georgia statutory framework, the Georgia constitution, and related state case law. See Lightfoot, 771 F.3d at 769-71. Still, "it is federal law, not state law, that ultimately governs whether an entity is immune under the Eleventh Amendment." Id. at 771 (noting that "[s]tate-law immunity does not control our analysis, particularly because Georgia also extends immunity to counties, which are clearly not immune under the Eleventh Amendment").
The Georgia Code creates county boards of health and defines their duties and powers. O.C.G.A. §§ 31-3-1, 4. It empowers the boards to establish and adopt their own bylaws, exercise responsibility [*12]  and authority in health-related matters within the county that do not fall under the purview of another agency, make contracts that may be subject to approval by the district director of health, and adopt rules and regulations so long as they do not conflict with those of the State Department of Health. O.C.G.A. § 31-3-4.
State law also establishes that each county board of health shall have seven members, and that each one comes from or is appointed by the county governing authority. O.C.G.A. § 31-3-2. Those members are not employees of the county board of health or the Georgia Department of Health. O.C.G.A. § 31-3-2(b).
The Georgia Code further provides some jurisdictional limitations as to the county boards of health. For example, "[t]he county board of health is empowered to . . . exercise responsibility and authority in all matters within the county pertaining to health unless the responsibility for enforcement of such is by law that of another agency." O.C.G.A. § 31-3-4(a)(2). Additionally, the Code provides that "[t]he county board of health shall have authority to establish rules and regulations which apply to all citizens and premises of the county or to specified areas and citizens therein without regard to the remainder of the county." O.C.G.A. § 31-3-6. All of these [*13]  provisions suggest that while the county boards of health are created by state law, they act within the limits of their counties, as opposed to some broader portion of the State. See Lightfoot, 771 F.3d at 771 ("[I]t is not sufficient that the [entity's] powers and duties are derived from state law" to receive Eleventh Amendment immunity.). All told, given the facts available to the Court, this factor does not weigh particularly heavily in one direction or the other—but since Defendant bears the burden, it weighs slightly against a finding that Defendant is acting as an arm of the State.
The second factor looks to the degree of control the State maintains over the entity, and the Eleventh Circuit has held that "[t]he degree of control is not to be assessed generally, but in light of the particular function at issue." Ga. State Conf. of NAACP, et al. v. Dekalb Cnty. Bd. of Registration and Elections, 484 F. Supp. 3d 1308, 1319 (N.D. Ga. 2020) (citing McAdams v. Jefferson Cnty. 911 Emergency Commc'ns. Dist., 931 F.3d 1132, 1135 (11th Cir. 2019)). Further, "[e]stablishing minimum requirements [that an entity or agency must meet] is not sufficient to demonstrate [state] control." Lightfoot, 771 F.3d at 773. Here, the function at issue is the hiring and firing of employees of the county boards of health, and while the Georgia Code empowers the boards in other areas, personnel decisions are not one of them. See O.C.G.A. §§ 31-3-4, 5, 12 (setting forth the duties, powers, and functions of the boards, [*14]  and providing that the director is responsible for ensuring compliance with Georgia health laws and reporting to the Georgia Department of Health in any manner "the department may specify" with no provisions for personnel decisions).
In the absence of any authority to suggest that the State retains any control of the county boards of health with respect to hiring and firing employees, this factor tends to weigh against finding that Defendant is entitled to immunity. See McAdams, 931 F.3d at 1135 (holding that factor two weighed against immunity where there was no evidence of state control over the function at issue—personnel decisions—and where state law stipulated that the local board of commissioners, which was appointed by counties and municipalities, had the power to "employ such employees, experts, and consultants as [the board] deem[ed] necessary" (first alteration in original and citation omitted)); Ga. State Conf. of NAACP, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 1319 (holding that the State did not exercise significant control over the county election board's determination of voter eligibility and finding that factor two weighed against immunity where the Georgia Code stated that the board was independently responsible for determining eligibility, and where the board [*15]  was responsible for overseeing and adjudicating voter registration challenges); cf. Pellitteri v. Prine, 776 F.3d 777, 781-82 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that the second factor weighed in favor of immunity where the State strictly regulated a sheriff's power to hire deputies by imposing several threshold requirements for the role, including requiring state-administered background checks and examinations, retaining the power to "functionally terminate" deputy sheriffs through disciplinary measures without the sheriff's consent, and providing the Governor ultimate authority to discipline or suspend the sheriff himself for certain misconduct).
Defendant argues that Governor Kemp issued an Executive Order that required it "to staff COVID-19 testing and screening services under the direction of the Georgia Department of Health—a state agency" and that, in doing so, placed the operation of COVID-19 testing and screening sites under the direct control of the State. (Doc. 4 at 13-14). Because Defendant wanted Plaintiff to work at a COVID-19 testing site, the argument goes, it was operating as an agent of the State. The language of the Executive Order states that:
[T]he State Health Officer shall have the authority to select which specific COVID-19 screening [*16]  and testing services operate on behalf of the State, health districts, and county boards of health. The selection of screening and testing services shall be based on a balancing of sound medical principles and the public health and safety interests of the State.
Governor Kemp, Executive Order 04.20.20.01, Providing Flexibility for Healthcare Practices, Moving Certain Businesses to Minimum Operations, & Providing for Emergency Response, https://gov.georgia.gov/executive-action/executive-orders/2020-executive-orders (emphasis added). This mandate provides for State authority in selecting COVID-19 screening and testing services, not in making personnel decisions within the specific local services it selects. The provision itself does not demonstrate State control over Defendant's personnel decisions, and it does not favor a finding of immunity under factor two. Indeed, Defendant makes its strongest argument for immunity based on the State's COVID-19 orders, but at the end of the day, those orders—like the state law that establishes the county boards in the first place—say nothing about a county board's ability to make personnel decisions like the one at issue here. As such, factor two [*17]  weighs against a finding of immunity.
Under factor three, the Court looks to where the entity derives its funds. Manders, 338 F.3d at 1323. The source of the funds is not the only consideration, however. For example, the Eleventh Circuit found that this factor weighs in favor of immunity for a Georgia sheriff, even though a majority of the sheriff's funding came from the county, because state law mandated that the county set the budget and, critically, the county had no say in how the sheriff spent the budgeted funds. Pellitteri, 776 F.3d at 782. Alternatively, significant state funding may be insufficient to demonstrate control when the county board or local entity itself retains substantial control over its own budget. See, e.g., Lightfoot, 771 F.3d at 776-77 (finding that this factor weighed against immunity even though the school district received "significant" funding from the state).
In Georgia, the county board of health is charged with holding a meeting to determine and fix the amount of money needed for the fiscal or calendar year. O.C.G.A. § 31-3-14. "[T]he budget shall include any unobligated moneys carried over from the current period and funds to be made available from sources other than county taxes." Id. Anticipated expenditures must be "certified by the county board [*18]  of health, with a copy of the budget, to the taxing authority of the county, which may fix and levy a tax rate sufficient to raise such amount at the same time and in the same manner prescribed for levying taxes for other county purposes, provided the taxing authority . . . deems the budget reasonable." Id. This suggests that Defendant receives local county funding.
The county board of health also has the power to "make contracts and establish fees for the provision of public health services provided by county boards of health." O.C.G.A. § 31-3-4(a)(6). These fees "may be used to defray costs of providing such local services and shall supplement but not replace state or federal funding." Id. This provision suggests that the county boards of health derive some funds from fees, but also that state or federal funding may contribute in some way to local health services. Georgia law further provides that the governing body of a county is responsible for providing its county board of health "with quarters and equipment sufficient for its operation." O.C.G.A. § 31-3-9.
The foregoing provisions tend to indicate that at least the core amount of funds for the county boards of health come from county taxes. They also indicate that the [*19]  county boards of health determine their budgets and that those budgets must be approved by only the county taxing authority. There is no indication of significant state funding, nor is there any indication that the State approves the budgets. Defendant states that no "local entity dictate[s] how the [Defendant's] budget will be spent in the exercise of its duties" and that "state law does not cede control to local governments in regulating what budget a county board of health needs to address COVID-19 . . . [or in dictating] how [a county board of health] spends its budget on public health measures." (Doc. 4 at 15). While these facts themselves may be true, Defendant also points to no law indicating that the State dictates how Defendant's budget will be spent. Further, a local county entity is required to approve Defendant's budget and, as Defendant acknowledges, Defendant itself is the one that creates that budget. See id.
Defendant argues that county sheriffs, district attorneys, and clerks of courts also receive local tax money to form a budget and that, because these entities and elected officials all receive Eleventh Amendment immunity, so too should it. (Doc. 9 at 6). However, Defendant makes this [*20]  assertion without acknowledging how these other entities and officials are distinct from Defendant in regard to both funding and the other three immunity factors. Given that Defendant sets its budget, which must be approved locally and is funded largely by county taxes, factor three weighs against a finding of immunity.
Finally, under factor four the Court looks to who is responsible for judgments against the entity. Manders, 338 F.3d at 1309. The Eleventh Circuit has called this the most important factor in determining immunity. Rosario v. Am. Corrective Counseling Servs., 506 F.3d 1039, 1046 (11th Cir. 2007). The question here is "whether the State would bear ultimate responsibility for an adverse judgment" against the defendant entity. Lightfoot, 771 F.3d at 777. Where an entity has fiscal autonomy to a point where "it cannot be said that a judgment against [the entity] will come from state funds," and where the first two factors establish that an entity has significant local control, the fourth factor weighs against a finding of immunity. Id. at 778 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Here, Defendant points to O.C.G.A. § 31-3-10, which relates to legal representation and provides that "[t]he county board of health may require the legal services of the county attorney or, its budget permitting, may employ other counsel to assist [*21]  in performing its duties." This subsection does not purport to address who bears responsibility for judgments against the entity, and while such an explicit statement of responsibility is not necessary to determine whether the fourth factor weighs in favor of or against immunity, it is at least notable that the State chose to incorporate a "legal" section without assuming or addressing such responsibility. Regarding fiscal autonomy, the county board of health sets a budget and the county taxing authority may then fix and levy a tax rate sufficient to raise such amount, which is evidence of significant local control and fiscal autonomy. O.C.G.A. § 31-3-14. As such, it cannot be said that a judgment against Defendant would necessarily come from state funds. While the State and the federal government seem to provide at least some funding for local health services, as indicated by O.C.G.A. § 3-3-4(a)(6), this still does not indicate that a judgment against the county board of health would necessarily come from state funds. Even without definitive guidance as to who would be responsible for a judgment against the entity, the fact that the county board is evidently responsible for all other expenses arising out of performance [*22]  of its duties indicates a likelihood that Defendant would be responsible for judgments against it. See Ga. State Conf. of NAACP, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 1319.
Defendant argues that "there is no law requiring local entities to cover the legal costs of any judgment against [Defendant]." (Doc. 4 at 15). However, it is Defendant's burden to demonstrate that a factor weighs in favor of immunity, and it cannot simply point to the absence of any law to do so. The Court finds that the fourth factor weighs against a finding of immunity.
This entire Eleventh Amendment immunity analysis is of course complicated by the emergency COVID-19 context. While Plaintiff's claims arise directly out of her termination, and thus a typical analysis would be confined to Defendant's hiring and firing practices in general, the claims in this case arise out of a termination that took place while an emergency executive order was in place that required county boards of health to conform to the State response to COVID-19. Still, this context does not change the previous analysis in such a way as to suggest that Defendant is entitled to immunity. Particularly under the second factor, there is simply no indication that the State took control over the hiring and firing decisions of the county [*23]  boards of health when it issued its executive orders.
Indeed, the executive orders themselves do not indicate that the State exercised any control over the hiring and firing decisions of Defendant. The Governor's order of April 20, 2020 states that the Department of Public Health is authorized to override "the orders of county boards of health, health districts, and their officers, directors, and employees to enforce the uniformity in the State's response to the spread . . ." of COVID-19. Governor Kemp, Executive Order 04.20.20.01, Providing Flexibility for Healthcare Practices, Moving Certain Businesses to Minimum Operations, & Providing for Emergency Response, https://gov.georgia.gov/executive-action/executive-orders/2020-executive-orders. It also states that "the State Health Officer shall have the authority to select which specific COVID-19 screening and testing services operate on behalf of the State, health districts, and county boards of health." Id. These orders show State control over the county boards of health with regard to their health-related duties, but they do not show State control over personnel decisions. While Defendant may have been subject to stricter control by [*24]  the State with regard to COVID-19 policy and testing, Defendant was not subject to State control in the context of personnel decisions. As such, Defendant is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims on Eleventh Amendment grounds should be denied.

C. ADA and FMLA Discrimination Claims

a. Disparate Treatment in Violation of the ADA
Count I of Plaintiff's complaint alleges disparate treatment in violation of the ADA. (Doc. 1 at 8-10). The ADA prohibits an employer from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability" with regard to hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation, training, job application procedures, or "other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Discrimination includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the known limitations of a qualified individual with a disability, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship. Id. at § 12112(b)(5)(A). Thus, "there are two distinct categories of disability discrimination claims under the ADA: (1) failure to accommodate and (2) disparate treatment." E.E.O.C. v. Eckerd Corp., No. 1:10-CV-2816-JEC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91370, 2012 WL 2568225, at *4 (N.D. Ga. July 2, 2012). Plaintiff alleges both.
Supreme Court precedent [*25]  holds that the complaint in an employment discrimination case need not contain specific facts establishing a prima facie case under the McDonnell Douglas2 evidentiary framework for such case to survive a motion to dismiss. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 510-11, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). Nevertheless, the Eleventh Circuit has held that complaints alleging discrimination still must meet the plausibility standard of Twombly and Iqbal. See Edwards v. Prime, Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1300-01 (11th Cir. 2010) (noting that to state a hostile-work-environment claim post-Iqbal, the employee "was required to allege" five prima facie elements and finding that plaintiff's hostile-work-environment claim was speculative because the fact that the plaintiff was Caucasian and the harassing coworkers were Hispanic was not enough, without more, to state a plausible claim of race discrimination); see also Henderson v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 436 F. App'x 935, 937 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that although a complaint in an employment discrimination case need not establish a prima facie case to survive a motion to dismiss, it still must satisfy the standards of Twombly and Iqbal). The complaint must "provide enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest intentional . . . discrimination." Surtain v. Hamlin Terrace Found., 789 F.3d 1239, 1246 (11th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).
In this case, therefore, Plaintiff must allege sufficient non-conclusory factual matter to state a plausible [*26]  claim for relief on each of her claims. While Plaintiff need not establish a prima facie case to survive Defendant's motion to dismiss, see Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510-11, it is useful for guidance purposes to note the prima facie formulation that the courts have developed. For a disparate treatment claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must show three things: (1) that she had a disability, (2) that she was otherwise qualified to perform the job, and (3) that she was discriminated against because of her disability. Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004).
Because Plaintiff alleges both a disparate treatment claim and a failure-to-accommodate claim, it is helpful to briefly note how the two differ. The primary difference between a disparate treatment claim and a failure-to-accommodate claim is that, under a disparate treatment claim, the plaintiff must prove discriminatory intent, while a discriminatory motive is not necessary for a reasonable accommodation claim. See Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262-63 (11th Cir. 2007). Disparate treatment "occurs when a disabled individual is treated differently than a non-disabled or less disabled individual because of his disability," while a failure to accommodate claim "occurs when a covered entity fails to fulfill its affirmative duty to make reasonable accommodation [*27]  to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability" without demonstrating that the accommodation would impose undue hardship on the entity. Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 24, 2007).3 For any claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish that her employer had actual knowledge of her alleged disability or regarded her as disabled. Brown v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., No. 1:20-CV-4566-JPB-JSA, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115735, 2021 WL 2479091, at *8 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 9, 2021).4
Defendant does not argue that Plaintiff is not disabled or that she is not a qualified individual. Rather, Defendant argues that there is no inference of discrimination as to Plaintiff's disparate treatment claim.
To prove disparate treatment, Plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to state a plausible claim that Defendant had discriminatory intent. See Booth v. City of Roswell, No. 1:17-CV-2490-LMM-CMS, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 236807, 2018 WL 10798041, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 22, 2018), adopted by, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 236804, 2018 WL 10798045 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 13, 2018). Here, Plaintiff has failed to plausibly allege facts showing discriminatory intent or that Defendant terminated her employment because of her disability. Plaintiff states in the complaint, in summary fashion, that Defendant violated the ADA by terminating and discriminating against Plaintiff based on her disability. (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 55-57). These statements merely recite legal conclusions and do not provide factual support connecting Plaintiff's disability to her termination. [*28]  Plaintiff fails to allege any comments or remarks made by Defendant that demonstrate discriminatory animus, nor has she identified any similarly situated employees who were treated more favorably than her. Indeed, in her response brief, Plaintiff notes nothing more than that she was terminated after expressing hesitation about working at a COVID-19 testing site. (Doc. 5 at 7-8). She does nothing to tie this argument to her disability or allege that any non-disabled employees were treated differently. See, e.g., Booth, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 236807, 2018 WL 10798041, at *5 (dismissing an ADA disparate treatment claim where plaintiff failed to allege any facts suggesting a discriminatory animus or any comparators who were treated more favorably). Plaintiff's disparate treatment claim should, therefore, be DISMISSED.

b. Failure to Accommodate in Violation of the ADA
As discussed above, "the term 'discriminate' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical. . . limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To prevail on a claim of disability [*29]  discrimination based on a failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she (1) has a disability under the ADA; (2) was a "qualified individual" when she suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation that would allow her to keep working. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Cappetta v. N. Fulton Eye Ctr., No. 1:15-CV-3412-LMM-JSA, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214906, 2017 WL 5197207, at *25 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 1, 2017), adopted by, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214787, 2017 WL 5443877 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 7, 2017). Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege facts showing that she sought a reasonable accommodation, or how any such accommodation would allow her to perform the essential functions of her job. (Doc. 4 at 18-21).
"[A]n employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).5 And it is the employee who has the burden of identifying an accommodation and demonstrating that it is reasonable. Id. at 1255. Further, under the ADA, an accommodation is "reasonable" and necessary "only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job," and while the ADA may require an employer to restructure a job by altering some of its "marginal functions, employers are not required to transform [*30]  the position into another one by eliminating functions that are essential to the nature of the job as it exists." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255, 1260. The Eleventh Circuit has not yet "determined precisely what form [a request for an accommodation] must take," but in Adigun v. Express Scripts, Inc., the court looked to how other circuits have addressed what qualifies as an adequate request. 742 F. App'x 474, 476 (11th Cir. 2018). The Third Circuit, for example, has said that a plaintiff must have provided "enough information that, under the circumstances, the employer can be fairly said to know of both the disability and desire for an accommodation." Id. (quoting Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 314 (3d Cir. 1999)). And the Tenth Circuit has stated that a plaintiff "'need not use magic words,' but 'should provide enough information about his or her limitations and desires [] to suggest at least the possibility that reasonable accommodation may be found in a reassignment job within the company.'" Id. (quoting Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1172 (10th Cir. 1999)).
Considering these approaches together, Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to support a finding that her expressions of "hesitation" due to her disability provided enough information about her limitations and desires to suggest that a reasonable accommodation could be found. See Smith, 180 F.3d at 1172. Plaintiff [*31]  alleged, weeks prior to her new site assignment, that she "expressed to Ms. Broach that doctors did not want her working where she could or would be exposed to COVID-19." (Doc. 1 at ¶ 26). However, Plaintiff does not allege what the essential functions of her job were, what accommodation she requested, or that she could have performed her job with that accommodation. She alleges only that she expressed "hesitation" and "fear" about working at a COVID-19 testing site because of her disability. This, again, says nothing about what the functions of her job were, what accommodation she requested, and whether she could have performed those unidentified job functions with such accommodation.
Plaintiff attempts to align her alleged request for an accommodation with that of the plaintiff in Barry v. Soash. No. 1:17-CV-2 (LJA), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17901, 2018 WL 715404, at *4 (M.D. Ga. Feb. 5, 2018).6 Defendant correctly notes, however, that the plaintiff in Barry made requests that were specific enough to constitute requests for a reasonable accommodation, in contrast to what Plaintiff alleges here. (Doc. 9 at 13). In Barry, the plaintiff alleged that he needed fifteen to twenty minute breaks at work when he became stressed, whereas here, Plaintiff made no specific requests at all. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17901, 2018 WL 715404, at *1, 3.
Plaintiff does allege in [*32]  her complaint that, on multiple occasions, Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process with her. (See Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 28, 42, 44, 48). An employer may be required "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify his or her limitations and possible accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). However, "where a plaintiff cannot demonstrate 'reasonable accommodation,' the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Plaintiff does not allege facts to support a finding that she requested a reasonable accommodation and, therefore, Defendant's alleged failure to engage in the interactive process is not relevant.
Plaintiff argues that she requested an accommodation in the form of a medical leave of absence on March 19, 2020. (Doc. 5 at 9). However, this was over a month before Plaintiff was even notified of her assignment to the COVID-19 testing site. (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 34-40). Further, Plaintiff did not allege in her complaint that she requested leave on March 19, 2020. Rather, she simply "inquired" if she qualified for leave due to her disability. Id. at ¶ 26. Even so, Plaintiff gave a doctor's note to Defendant [*33]  and did not return to work until April 22, 2020. Id. at 30-34. Thus, Plaintiff received the leave she requested.
Plaintiff also argues that she "repeatedly requested to not be placed at the specimen point of collection site or the COVID-19 testing site due to her disability," but that Defendant failed engage in the interactive process and refused to accommodate her. (Doc. 5 at 9). Plaintiff, however, has not alleged that she requested not to be placed at those sites; instead, she simply pleads that she expressed "hesitation" and "fear" about the assignment. (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 41, 43, 46). This was simply not enough to have put Defendant on notice of what Plaintiff's request was. For example, does expressing hesitation mean that Plaintiff was requesting not to be at the site? Or not to be near those who were being tested? Or not to be near anyone? Plaintiff had to give Defendant a more clear idea of what accommodation she needed. See Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that the plaintiff did not adequately request a reasonable accommodation where her manager informed her of her new job requirements and plaintiff simply told the manager that she knew she could not meet those requirements).
But even if this were enough [*34]  to constitute a request for accommodation, Plaintiff still does not allege anything about the essential functions of her job and whether this accommodation—if any—would allow her to perform those functions. Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient for the Court to find she requested a reasonable accommodation, and her failure-to-accommodate claim should be DISMISSED.

c. Retaliation in Violation of the ADA
The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). This provision creates prohibitions on retaliation similar to those in Title VII, and the Eleventh Circuit therefore assesses ADA retaliation claims under the same framework as for Title VII retaliation claims. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997).
As with her discrimination claim, Plaintiff need not establish a prima facie case of retaliation to survive Defendant's motion to dismiss, see Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510-11, however, it is useful for guidance purposes to note the prima facie formulation that the courts have developed. [*35]  To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff must show (1) statutorily protected expression; (2) adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287; Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1261. "The first element may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation," while "the third element requires a showing of but-for causation." Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258.
As noted above, Plaintiff does not plausibly allege that she requested a reasonable accommodation. Nor has Plaintiff otherwise alleged that she engaged in statutorily protected expression. As such, her retaliation claim should also be DISMISSED. See Phillips v. Harbor Venice Mgmt., LLC, No. 8:19-CV-2379-T-33TGW, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15061, 2020 WL 495224, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 30, 2020) (dismissing an ADA retaliation claim where it was not clear what specific accommodations plaintiff requested); Ponce v. City of Naples, No. 2:17-CV-137-FTM-99CM, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96170, 2017 WL 2692829, at *5-6 (M.D. Fla. June 22, 2017) (finding that plaintiff did not sufficiently allege that he engaged in a statutorily protected activity for which he was retaliated against where he did not plausibly allege that he made a reasonable accommodation request).

D. Retaliation under the FMLA and the FFCRA
In Count Four of her complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she was retaliated against under the FMLA and [*36]  the FFCRA. Defendant does not move to dismiss Count Four in its motion to dismiss, other than by arguing that it is entitled to Eleventh Amendment Immunity. Because the undersigned recommends that the Court deny the motion on Eleventh Amendment grounds, Count Four of the complaint should survive the motion to dismiss.

E. Punitive Damages
Defendant argues that, because it is a "'public agency created by state law,'" and thus a governmental entity under the ADA or FMLA, punitive damages are prohibited by federal law. (Doc. 4 at 22-23 (quoting Doc. 1 at 3)). Plaintiff does not respond to this argument, meaning that she has abandoned her claims for punitive damages. (See generally Doc. 5); see also SIS, LLC v. Stoneridge Holdings, Inc., No. 1:17-CV-1816-ELR, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 229882, 2019 WL 8277244, at *6 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 5, 2019) (noting that, "[w]hen an argument is raised that a claim is subject to dismissal, and the non-moving party fails to respond to such an argument, such claims are deemed abandoned").
Nevertheless, the Court agrees with the Defendant on the merits of the argument as well. The enforcement provision of Title I of the ADA, § 12117, "adopts the powers, remedies, and procedures set forth in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, specifically 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5." Rumler v. Dep't of Corr., 546 F. Supp. 2d 1334, 1341 (M.D. Fla. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The 1991 amendments to the Civil Rights Act expanded the scope of remedies available [*37]  under that section to include compensatory and punitive damages. See 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(2). However, under § 1981a(b)(1), and accordingly under the ADA, recovery of punitive damages is not permitted against an employer who is a government, government agency, or political subdivision. 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(1); see also Hoskins v. City of Atlanta, No. 1:07-CV-2347-BBM, 2009 WL 10666090, at *10 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 23, 2009); Houston v. Manatee Cnty., No. 8:20-CV-782-CEH-JSS, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21301, 2021 WL 391329, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 4. 2021).
Here, Defendant is a county board of health established under Georgia law, and while Defendant may not be an arm of the State for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity, Defendant is at least a local government entity or political subdivision subject to the limitations set forth in § 1981a(b)(1). Plaintiff indicates in her complaint that Defendant is a public agency created by state law, (Doc. 1 at 3), and Plaintiff therefore cannot recover punitive damages under the ADA.
Under the FMLA, punitive damages are also not available. Feliz v. United Parcel Servs., Inc., No. 16-21042-CIV-Scola, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 223010, 2017 WL 5634304, at *3 (S.D. Fla. May 10, 2017) (noting that the FMLA does not provide for punitive damages); Juback v. Michaels Stores, Inc., No. 8:14-CV-913-T-27, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100321, 2014 WL 3720540, at *4 (M.D. Fla. July 23, 2014) ("[E]motional and punitive damages are not available under the FMLA."). To the extent that Plaintiff seeks punitive damages as to her FMLA claim (and it is not entirely clear that she does), she is not entitled to such damages. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that the motion to strike any prayer for relief seeking [*38]  punitive damages under the ADA or FMLA be GRANTED.

F. Plaintiff's Request to Amend the Complaint
In her response to the motion to dismiss, Plaintiff requests that she be granted leave to amend her complaint should the Court find in favor of Defendant. (Doc. 5 at 11).
Prior to 2002, a district court could not dismiss a complaint with prejudice without first giving the plaintiff a chance to amend the complaint if a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim. Bank v. Pitt, 928 F.2d 1108, 1112 (11th Cir. 1991). However, in 2002, the Eleventh Circuit overruled Bank in part and held that, "[a] district court is not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint sua sponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested leave to amend before the district court." Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir. 2002) (en banc). And "[w]here a request for leave to file an amended complaint simply is imbedded within an opposition memorandum, the issue has not been raised properly." Posner v. Essex Ins. Co., 178 F.3d 1209, 1222 (11th Cir. 1999).
Here, as Plaintiff is represented by counsel, the Court is not required to grant Plaintiff leave to amend where Plaintiff simply imbedded her request for leave to amend in her response to the motion to dismiss. Nor does Plaintiff attach an amended complaint [*39]  or suggest what she would allege in an amended complaint. As such, Plaintiff's request for leave to amend should be denied. See Rosenberg v. Gould, 554 F.3d 962, 967 (11th Cir. 2009) (concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying request for leave to amend where the request was merely included in a footnote in the plaintiffs' brief in opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss and did not "describe the substance of [the] proposed amendment"); United States ex rel. Atkins v. McInteer, 470 F.3d 1350, 1361-62 (11th Cir. 2006) (affirming denial of leave to amend where the plaintiff did not file a motion for leave to amend, the request for leave to amend was included in the memorandum she filed in opposition to the motion to dismiss, and she failed to attach the amendment or set forth the substance of the proposed amendment).

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion to dismiss be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. Specifically, the Court recommends that all of Plaintiff's claims, apart from Plaintiff's FMLA and FFCRA retaliation claims, be DISMISSED. The Court also RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion to strike any prayer for relief seeking punitive damages under the ADA and FMLA be GRANTED.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED, this 17th day of December, [*40]  2021.
