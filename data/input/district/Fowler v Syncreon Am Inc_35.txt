Opinion



ORDER
Kelly Fowler, an employee of syncreon America, Inc. ("syncreon"), alleges that the company violated the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., in two ways. Specifically, she claims that syncreon removed her from her position based on a perceived disability in July 2015 (Count I) and then, for eighteen months, failed to place her in similar positions based on the same perceived disability (Count II). syncreon has moved for summary judgment [33] as to both claims. For the following reasons, that motion is granted in part and denied in part.

Background1

I. Fowler's Work History Prior to July 2015
Fowler began working for syncreon in February 2006 as a Material Tech Handler, informally known as a "tugger." Defendant's L.R. 56.1 Statement of Facts ("DSOF") ¶ 4, ECF No. 34. In that role, Fowler was responsible for operating a tugger, a small motorized vehicle used to transport automotive parts within the company's warehouse. Id. ¶ 5.
 [*2] Fowler was diagnosed in January 2012 with peripheral neuropathy and immediately went on medical leave. Id. ¶ 9. She returned to work about a month later, but went back on leave from mid-June to late July 2012. Id. ¶¶ 9-10. In late October of that year, Fowler submitted an accommodation request for her neuropathy symptoms, seeking to "be off [her] feet as much as possible." Id. ¶ 11.
Along with the request, Fowler submitted a note from Dave Finnegan, a physician's assistant, stating that her neuropathy restricted her ability to use her legs, that she could not squat or kneel, and that she should perform sit-down work only. Id. ¶ 12. After another medical leave in November 2012, Fowler submitted an additional accommodation request, specifically requesting that she be allowed to "get off [her] feet at times due to pain and cramping in [her] feet and toes." Id. ¶ 14. Fowler then received short-term disability benefits from late November 2012 through late March 2013. Id. ¶ 15.
Significantly, in April 2013, Fowler's physician, Dr. Kimberland Anderson, faxed a document to syncreon permitting Fowler to return to full duty without any restrictions. Pl.'s L.R. 56.1 Statement of Additional Facts ("PSOAF") ¶ 6, ECF No. 42. A month later, Fowler successfully bid on a sit-down tugger position. DSOF ¶ 17. The difference between a stand-up tugger vehicle—which Fowler operated from 2006 to 2013—and a sit-down tugger is that the latter has a seat that allows the operator to [*3]  sit during use. Id. ¶¶ 6, 16. Both types of vehicles required Fowler to climb on and off the tugger up to 150 times a day. DSOF ¶ 7.
A month into Fowler's tenure as a sit-down tugger, in June 2013, syncreon states, it learned that the employee union had enlisted other tugger operators to assist Fowler with her duties. Id. ¶ 19. Barbara Vannetter, a Human Resources Specialist, met with Fowler and explained to her that this arrangement was not acceptable. Id. ¶ 21. Fowler assured Vannetter that she was able to perform the functions of the sit-down tugger position without assistance. Id. ¶ 22.
syncreon further asserts that, a few months later, in September 2013, Diane Gilley, the Human Resources Manager, received a complaint from one of Fowler's co-workers that Fowler had yelled at her for not helping Fowler with her job duties. Id. ¶ 23. Vannetter and Kendall Kelly, a union representative, met with Fowler regarding this complaint, id. ¶ 24, and Fowler assured them that she could perform all the functions of the sit-down tugger position, id. ¶ 25. According to syncreon, Fowler did concede that "it would be nice to have help" since getting on and off the tugger "bother[ed] [her] feet."  [*4] Id.
In May 2014, Fowler underwent triple bypass heart surgery and went on medical leave until August 2014. Id. ¶ 27. To facilitate her return, Angela Pearon, a certified nurse practitioner, sent syncreon a completed Fitness for Duty evaluation form, noting that Fowler was able to perform the essential functions of her position. PSOAF ¶ 7.
In July 2015, syncreon implemented a new automatic guided cart system to improve productivity and reduce injuries. DSOF ¶ 28. The system reduced the number of tuggers on Fowler's line during her shift from three to two. Id. ¶ 29. Gilley informed Fowler at a meeting that Fowler's position had been eliminated and that the company would try to find another position that met her restrictions. Id. ¶¶ 30-31. For her part, Fowler claims that she had no restrictions at this time and that she should have been retained based on her seniority. Resp. to DSOF ¶ 32, ECF No. 43. Fowler also testified that Gilley told her at the meeting that her restrictions were why Fowler was the one to lose her job, rather than her two shift co-workers. Pl.'s Ex. J, Fowler Dep. at 179:12-180:5, ECF No. 44. Following the meeting, Gilley assigned Fowler to light duty in the breakroom [*5]  with full pay. DSOF ¶ 32.

II. After Fowler Lost Her Tugger Position in July 2015
In August 2015, Fowler provided syncreon with a letter from her primary care physician, Dr. Michael Kouimelis, indicating that she was "able to work and periodically can be standing throughout the day." Id. ¶¶ 33-34. Gilley asked Fowler to provide additional documentation to clarify the word "periodically." Id. ¶ 36. Fowler complied and submitted a second note from Dr. Kouimelis stating that Fowler was "able to perform her job duties, including stepping up and down from her tugger." Id. ¶ 37.
A month later, Fowler agreed at syncreon's request to submit to an independent medical evaluation by Dr. Robin Borchardt to assess her ability to perform the duties of a sit-down tugger operator. Id. ¶¶ 39-40. After reviewing written job descriptions supplied by syncreon, Dr. Borchardt determined that Fowler was not able to meet the physical requirements of any of the available tugger positions. Id. at ¶¶ 40-42. It is undisputed that Dr. Borchardt's evaluation relied on the physical restrictions that Fowler relayed to syncreon in October 2012. PSOAF ¶ 21.
In October 2015, Gilley and Danny Arnold, the Union Chair, informed [*6]  Fowler that syncreon did not have any positions available for her. DSOF ¶ 43. syncreon states that it placed Fowler on medical leave following this meeting and that it provided her with short-term disability benefits until May 2016, id. ¶ 48-50. Fowler denies that she was placed on medical leave, agreeing only that she was eventually compensated an amount equivalent to six months of short-term disability, Resp. to DSOF ¶¶ 48-50.
The parties do not dispute that, in November 2015, Fowler provided syncreon with another note from Finnegan. Unlike in late 2012, Finnegan's note attested that Fowler was "capable of performing her job and [could] get up [and] down from seated position on [and] off a tugger." The note also observed that Fowler had "been doing this job for many years to this point." PSOAF ¶ 23.
In June 2016, syncreon asked Dr. Borchardt to evaluate whether Fowler could perform a number of alternative positions given her restrictions. DSOF ¶ 51. Dr. Borchardt responded that Fowler's neuropathy limited her to performing jobs that did not require her to frequently climb on and off equipment and recommended placement in a position that did not require such climbing more than a couple [*7]  times per hour. Id. at ¶ 52.
Four months later, syncreon instructed Fowler to contact Dr. Monica Simionescu, a neurologist, for another opinion. Id. ¶ 60. Dr. Simionescu conducted a neurological examination and determined that Fowler was able to work without restrictions. Id. ¶ 61. After receiving Dr. Simionescu's evaluation, syncreon reinstated Fowler in November 2016 as a Material Technician approved to operate stand-up and sit-down tuggers. Id. ¶ 62. She works there still.
Fowler subsequently brought this action under the ADA, alleging that she suffered disparate treatment both when syncreon removed her from her position in July 2015 (Count I) and when the company failed to rehire her as a tugger between July 2015 and November 2016 (Count II). Compl., ECF No. 1. syncreon moves for summary judgment as to both claims. See Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 33; Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J., ECF No. 35.

Legal Standard
"The Court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). To survive summary judgment, the nonmoving party must "do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical [*8]  doubt as to the material facts," Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), and instead must "establish some genuine issue for trial such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict in her favor." Gordon v. FedEx Freight, Inc., 674 F.3d 769, 772-73 (7th Cir. 2012).
In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court gives the nonmoving party "the benefit of conflicts in the evidence and reasonable inferences that could be drawn from it." Grochocinski v. Mayer Brown Rowe & Maw, LLP, 719 F.3d 785, 794 (7th Cir. 2013). The Court must not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. See McCann v. Iroquois Mem'l Hosp., 622 F.3d 745, 752 (7th Cir. 2013).

Analysis

I. Fowler's Disparate-Treatment Claim For Losing Her Tugger Position (Count I)
Turning to Count I, "[a] claim for disparate treatment based on disability under the ADA . . . requires proof ([A]) plaintiff was disabled; ([B]) plaintiff was qualified to perform essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation; and ([C]) disability was the 'but for' cause of adverse employment action." Scheidler v. Indiana, 914 F.3d 535, 541 (7th Cir. 2019) (citing Monroe v. Ind. Dep't of Transp., 871 F.3d 503-04 (7th Cir. 2017)). The Court concludes that Fowler has done enough to survive summary judgment as to her claim that she was terminated from her tugger position in July 2015 due to her perceived disability.

A. Disability
The ADA defines "disability" as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record [*9]  of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." Shell v. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Co., 941 F.3d 331, 335 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)).
syncreon first argues that, to qualify as disabled under the "regarded as" prong, Fowler must show that the company believed she was "substantially limited" in a "major life activity," Sutton v. United Airlines Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999). Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J. at 8-9. But this is incorrect. The 2008 Amendments to the ADA clarified that an individual can be "regarded as" having an impairment "whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major activity," Richardson v. Chicago Transit Auth., 926 F.3d 881, 888 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A)); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(2).
Here, a reasonable jury could conclude that syncreon "regarded" Fowler as having an impairment when she lost her job in July 2015. Among other things, Fowler testified that Gilley explicitly informed her that she—rather than either of her two co-workers—was terminated because of her 2012 restrictions relating to her neuropathy. Fowler Dep. at 179:12-180:5; see Richardson, 926 F.3d at 887 (explaining that the EEOC defines "physical impairment" as "[a]ny physiological disorder or condition . . . affecting one or more body systems, such as [the] neurological [system] . . . ."); E.E.O.C. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 233 F.3d 432, 438 (7th Cir. 2000) (treating neuropathy as a physical impairment under the ADA).

B. Qualified Individual
A reasonable jury also [*10]  could find from this record that Fowler, in July 2015, was a "qualified individual" under the ADA, because she could "perform the essential functions" of her tugger position. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). It is true that, in 2012, Fowler requested to "be off [her] feet as much as possible," DSOF ¶ 11-14, and it is undisputed that both the sit-down and stand-up tugger vehicles required Fowler to climb on and off the machine up to 150 times per day, id. ¶ 7. But the question is not whether Fowler was qualified to work as a tugger in 2012, but whether she was able to perform her job in 2015. See, e.g., EEOC v. S & C Electric Co., 303 F. Supp. 3d 687, 689 (N.D. Ill. 2018) ("Whether an individual is a qualified individual with a disability is determined at the time of the employment decision." (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).
In this regard, Dr. Anderson notified syncreon in April 2013 that Fowler could return to work without any restrictions. PSOAF ¶ 6. Additionally, in mid-2014, Pearon performed a Fitness for Duty evaluation and concluded that Fowler was able to perform the essential functions of her position. Id. ¶ 7. While syncreon argues that Fowler subsequently relied on the assistance of other employees to complete her work, it could point to only two such incidents during [*11]  a brief three-month stretch in 2013. DSOF ¶¶ 19-25. And, apart from a leave in 2014 relating to her heart surgery, Fowler worked as a tugger for all of 2014 and most of 2015 and did not receive any disciplinary actions as a result of job performance. PSOAF ¶ 10. Similarly, Fowler has testified that, while she would occasionally receive help from her co-workers, it was in the context of working as a team to make things "more efficient"; she insists that she did not have difficulty doing her job and that no one had to help her. Fowler Dep. 47:12-49:10.
Given Fowler's medical evaluations in 2013 and 2014, and the fact that she worked as a tugger for a meaningful period, a reasonable juror could conclude that she was qualified for that job at the time she lost it in July 2015. See, e.g., Moore v. Hexacomb Corp., 670 F. Supp. 2d 621, 627 (W.D. Mich. 2009) (rejecting argument that plaintiff was not qualified for a position because he "had a record of successfully performing the . . . position . . . for several years").

C. Adverse Employment Action Based on Disability
Fowler also has put forth evidence that she was subject to an adverse employment action because of her perceived disability. See Alamo v. Bliss, 864 F.3d 541, 552 (7th Cir. 2017) (defining an adverse employment action as "a materially adverse [*12]  change in the terms and conditions of employment [that is] more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities." (quoting Stockett v. Muncie Ind. Transit Sys., 221 F.3d 997, 1001 (7th Cir. 2000))). While syncreon contends that Fowler lost her job because her position was "eliminated," Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J. at 2, it is undisputed that the new system simply reduced the number of tuggers required on Fowler's line from three to two, DSOF ¶ 29. And Fowler testified that Gilley told her that she was the odd person out because of her physical restrictions relating to her neuropathy, even though she had seniority. Fowler Dep. at 179:12-180:5. This testimony is enough for a reasonable jury to conclude both that syncreon took an adverse action against Fowler and that the action was based on a perceived impairment. See Smart v. Ball State University, 89 F.3d 437 (7th Cir. 1996) ("A wide variety of actions can qualify [as an adverse employment action], some blatant and some subtle." (citation omitted)).

II. Fowler's Disparate-Treatment Claim Based on syncreon's Failure to Rehire Her as a Tugger Until November 2016 (Count II)
Count II faults syncreon for not rehiring her as a tugger from the time she was removed from her job in July 2015 until she was reinstated in November 2016. See Compl. [*13]  at 5-6; Mem. in Opp. to Summ. J. at 1-2, ECF No. 46-1. Although Fowler labels this count as alleging a failure-to-accommodate claim, the exact nature of this claim is rather puzzling.
First, Fowler acknowledges that she never asked for an accommodation. Mem. in Opp. to Summ. J. at 12; see James v. Hyatt Regency Chi., 707 F.3d 775, 782 (7th Cir. 2013) ("[T]he standard rule is that a plaintiff must normally request an accommodation before liability under the ADA attaches." (quoting Jovanovic v. Emerson Elec. Co., 201 F.3d 894, 899 (7th Cir. 2000))). Second, she says that she did not need an accommodation. Mem. in Opp. to Summ. J. at 12; see EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 345 F. Supp. 3d 1046, 1062 (W.D. Wis. 2018) ("Once an employee requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer must meet the employee half way . . . to identify the necessary accommodations." (emphasis added)). In fact, Fowler asserts that she did not even have physical restrictions to accommodate during the relevant period. Mem. in Opp. to Summ. J. at 5, 12.
Based upon the factual allegations made in the complaint and the theories advanced in Fowler's response brief, it is clear that the gist of Fowler's "failure to accommodate" claim is that the company should have rehired her as a tugger between July 2015 and November 2016, but did not do so based upon her perceived disabilities. Nowhere does she argue that she [*14]  should have been reassigned to a less physically demanding position more suitable to her restrictions (because, again, she claims that she did not have any at the time). Id. at 5-6; cf. Stern v. St. Anthony's Health Ctr., 788 F.3d 276, 291 (7th Cir. 2015) (noting that "the ADA may require an employer to reassign a disabled employee to a different position as reasonable accommodation where the employee can no longer perform the essential functions of their current position" but can perform the essential functions of a different, vacant position (emphases added) (citation omitted)).
Accordingly, this claim cannot proceed as a failure-to-accommodate claim, but is more properly construed as a disparate-treatment claim based upon syncreon's failure to rehire Fowler as a tugger between July 2015 and November 2016. See Moore-Fotso v. Bd. of Educ. of the City of Chicago, 211 F. Supp. 3d 1012, 1036 (N.D. Ill. 2016); see also McGowan, No. 03 C 4546, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15932, 2004 WL 2034084, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 12, 2004) ("[L]egal characterizations of a claim that are contained in a complaint are not binding and limiting. . . . If the facts alleged support relief, other legal bases for the claims may be substituted." (citing Forseth v. Vill. of Sussex, 199 F.3d 363, 368 (7th Cir. 2000))); Duthie v. Matria Healthcare, Inc., 535 F. Supp. 2d 909, 917 n.7 (N.D. Ill. 2008) ("[A] claim is measured by its substance, not the designation chosen for it by the pleading's author."). And, so construed, Fowler has put forth enough evidence to survive summary judgment as to this claim.
First, it is undisputed [*15]  that syncreon regarded Fowler as physically impaired during that time and that it relied on that perceived impairment to bar her from working as a tugger. See Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J. at 9 (acknowledging that the company did not place Fowler in another sit-down tugger position after she lost her job because, in its view, Fowler "could not perform the duties of the . . . position within her medical restrictions [relating to neuropathy]"). It is also not contested, nor could it be, that the failure to hire Fowler for a tugger position was an adverse employment action. See, e.g., Dixon v. The CMS, No. 14 C 4986, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148614, 2015 WL 6701771, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 3, 2015) (describing being "turned down for a job" as an adequate basis for an ADA disparate-treatment claim); Moore-Fotso, 211 F. Supp. 3d at 1037.
The remaining question, then, is whether Fowler was qualified to work as a tugger from July 2015 to November 2016. And that is a question for the jury, not the Court. As noted above, though Fowler indicated in 2012 that she had physical restrictions relating to her neuropathy, DSOF ¶¶ 11-14, she submitted a medical evaluation in 2013 stating that she had no restrictions, PSOAF ¶ 6, and another evaluation in 2014 stating that she could perform the essential functions of the job, id. ¶ 7. Furthermore, she worked [*16]  as a tugger from May 2013 to July 2015, and the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Fowler, suggests that she did not require the help of co-workers during that time. See supra. Moreover, while Dr. Borchardt concluded in September 2015 and June 2016 that Fowler was unable to perform the duties of a tugger (and related positions), it is undisputed that at least the first of evaluations relied on Fowler's 2012 restrictions, PSOAF ¶ 21—which may have been outdated by the time of the evaluation,2 see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 6-7. Lastly, it is undisputed that in August 2015 and November 2015, Fowler provided syncreon with notes from medical professionals—including the author of her 2012 restrictions—stating that she could in fact perform the duties of a tugger. DSOF ¶¶ 33-37, 46; PSOAF ¶ 23.
Based upon this record, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Fowler was qualified to work as a tugger from July 2015 to November 2016. See Ferguson v. City of Chicago, No. 13 C 4084, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139396, 2015 WL 5996332, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 13, 2015) (denying summary judgment where, notwithstanding a doctor's determination that plaintiff was not fit for duty, plaintiff had presented "some medical and expert evidence, in addition to his own testimony, that he was able to perform [*17]  the essential functions of his job [at the time of the adverse action]."). Summary judgment as to this disparate-treatment claim is thus denied as well.

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, syncreon's motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part. The motion is denied as to Count I. It is granted as to Count II to the extent it attempts to assert a failure-to-accommodate claim; it may proceed as a disparate-treatment claim.
