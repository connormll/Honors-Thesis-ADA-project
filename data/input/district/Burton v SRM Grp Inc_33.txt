Opinion



ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Kenita Burton brings this action against Defendant SRM Group, Inc., her former employer, asserting claims of failure to accommodate (based on a theory of actual disability), disability discrimination (based on a theory that Defendant regarded her as disabled), and retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12112, et seq., and claims of interference and retaliation in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq. Defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 77),1 which Plaintiff opposes, (Doc. 88). Defendant filed a reply in support of its motion. (Doc. 97). For the reasons that follow, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 77), be DENIED in its entirety.

I. FACTS

A. Standards for Presenting Facts at Summary Judgment [*2] 
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts from Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, (Doc. 77-1); Plaintiff's Responses and Objections to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts, (Doc. 88-3); Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts, (Doc. 88-4); and Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts, (Doc. 96). Additionally, as indicated and as needed, the Court draws some facts directly from the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.").
For those facts submitted by Defendant that are supported by citations to record evidence, and that Plaintiff has not specifically disputed and refuted with citations to admissible record evidence showing a genuine dispute of fact, the Court deems those facts admitted, under Local Rule 56.1B. See LR 56.1B(2)(a)(2), NDGa. ("This Court will deem each of the movant's facts as admitted unless the respondent: (i) directly refutes the movant's fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (ii) states a valid objection to the admissibility of the movant's fact; or (iii) points out that the [*3]  movant's citation does not support the movant's fact or that the movant's fact is not material or otherwise has failed to comply with the provisions set out in LR 56.1(B)(1).").
The Court has excluded assertions of fact by either party that are immaterial, presented as arguments or legal conclusions, unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record, or asserted only in the party's brief and not the statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B)(1), NDGa. ("The Court will not consider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence . . . (c) stated as an issue or legal conclusion; or (d) set out only in the brief and not in the movant's [or respondent's] statement of undisputed facts."). The Court has also viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on a defendant's motion for summary judgment. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993). Plaintiff disputes some of Defendant's proffered facts, but many of those objections are over matters that are not necessarily material to the disposition of this case. Accordingly, the Court will not rule on each objection or dispute presented and will discuss those objections and disputes only when necessary to do so regarding a genuine dispute of a material [*4]  issue of fact.

B. Material Facts

1. Plaintiff's Employment and Collective Bargaining Agreement
Plaintiff was employed by Defendant as a housekeeper between 2012 and her termination on May 30, 2017. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 1). Plaintiff's immediate supervisor was Housekeeping Supervisor Lisa Glover. Id. at ¶ 4. Glover reported to Assistant Project Manager Bruce Mastone, who also supervised Plaintiff. Id. at ¶ 5. Mastone reported to Project Manager Ralph Thomas, who also supervised Glover and Plaintiff. Id. at ¶ 6. During the period of time at issue in this lawsuit, Plaintiff's employment relationship with Defendant was governed in part by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) made by Local Union No. 4873 of the Industrial, Technical & Professional Employees Union OPEIU, AFL-CIO, 10. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 5). The CBA provided for a three-strike attendance policy, whereby employees were terminated after three "occurrences" during a 90-day period. Id. at ¶ 6. An occurrence is any unscheduled absence, with absence defined as any unscheduled time lost from work regardless of reason, including sick time. Id. at ¶ 7. Employees would not receive an occurrence for an unscheduled absence if they had vacation [*5]  time or sick time to cover the absence. Id. at ¶¶ 8, 9. The CBA provided for an escalating response to absences by an employee who had exhausted all sick leave, namely, counseling for a first occurrence, a written warning for a second occurrence, and termination for a third occurrence. Id. at ¶ 10.

2. Plaintiff's 2017 Occurrences
On March 17, 2017, Plaintiff failed to appear for work, despite the fact that her request for leave had been expressly denied by Thomas. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶¶ 14, 15). Glover issued an occurrence to Plaintiff on March 20, 2017, for this absence. Id. at ¶ 17.
Plaintiff was scheduled to work during the week of Monday May 22, 2017, through Friday May 26, 2017. Id. at ¶ 19. The parties agree that Plaintiff called and texted her immediate supervisor, Glover, before the start of her shift on Monday May 22, 2017, and informed Glover that she was ill. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 20; Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 17). However, the parties dispute whether Plaintiff told Glover that she was specifically suffering from a migraine and had been in the emergency room the day before, whether Plaintiff asked Glover for permission to take the day off because of her migraine, and whether Glover was authorized [*6]  to and did give permission for Plaintiff to have the day off. (See Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 18; Doc. 96 at ¶ 18; see also Doc. 82 at 79:16-80:13 (Glover's deposition testimony that Plaintiff told her during the May 22 telephone call that she was not feeling well but that Plaintiff did not say that she was suffering from a migraine or that she had been in the emergency room); Doc. 85 at 35:4-10, 39:2-6 (Plaintiff's deposition testimony that she told Glover during the May 22 telephone call that she would not be able to come into work because she had a migraine and that she had gone to the emergency room)). Plaintiff did not have available sick leave to cover the May 22 absence. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 22).
Plaintiff returned to work on Tuesday May 23, 2017, with a doctor's note from the Southeast Georgia Health System Emergency Care Center dated Sunday May 21, 2017, requesting that Plaintiff be excused from work for one day, which she gave to Glover. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 23; Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 19; see also Doc. 82-3). The doctor's note did not specify the reason for Plaintiff's visit or use the word "migraine," but it did indicate that Plaintiff should make a follow-up appointment with a neurologist within 72 hours. [*7]  (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 24; Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 20; see also Doc. 82-3). Glover issued Plaintiff an occurrence on May 23, arising out of her absence on May 22. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 25). On Wednesday May 24, 2017, Plaintiff reported for work, but she informed Glover that she had to leave work early because she had vomited at work due to a migraine. Id. at ¶ 26; (see also Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 23; Doc. 82 at 92:6-17). Glover called Thomas to advise him that Plaintiff was suffering from a migraine, had vomited at work, and needed to leave work to seek medical treatment at the emergency room. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 25).2 There is some dispute over the nature and substance of this conversation. The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff was in the room when Glover called Thomas, that Thomas agreed that Plaintiff could leave work to go to the hospital, and that Thomas stated on the call that Plaintiff would not get into trouble for leaving work early. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 26, 27, 28; Doc. 96 at ¶¶ 26, 27, 28; see also Doc. 82 at 99:16-24 (Glover's deposition testimony that Thomas said that Plaintiff would not get into trouble for leaving work early)).3 The parties do dispute whether Glover called Thomas on speakerphone. (Doc. [*8]  88-4 at ¶¶ 26, 27, 28; Doc. 96 at ¶¶ 26, 27, 28).
The emergency room doctors who treated Plaintiff on May 24 recommended that she be excused from work for three days. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 30; see also Doc. 82-4). On the evening of May 24, Plaintiff called Thomas to advise him about her anticipated absence from work for the next three days and the status of her migraine condition. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 31; Doc. 96 at ¶ 31). Thomas told Plaintiff to take care of herself and assured her that her job was "secure." (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 32; Doc. 96 at ¶ 32). Thomas told Glover that Plaintiff's doctor recommended that she be absent from work for three days. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 33; Doc. 96 at ¶ 33). On Thursday May 25, 2017, Plaintiff again spoke with Thomas by phone to update him on her condition, and Thomas told her that he would not give her an occurrence. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 34; Doc. 96 at ¶ 34). Plaintiff also called Thomas on Friday May 26, 2017, to check in. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 36; Doc. 96 at ¶ 36). Plaintiff returned to work on her next scheduled workday, Tuesday May 30, 2017, and she brought the doctor's note from her May 24th visit to the emergency room. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 28; see also Doc. 82-4). The May 24 [*9]  doctor's note did not specify an illness or injury or use the word "migraine," but it did note that Plaintiff should schedule a follow-up appointment with a neurologist within 72 hours. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 30; Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 46; see also Doc. 82-4). On May 30, 2017, Plaintiff was issued an occurrence for not showing up to work on Thursday May 25. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 31). She did not have accumulated sick leave to cover her absence on May 25. Id. at ¶ 32.

3. Plaintiff's Termination and EEOC Charge
On the morning of May 30, 2017, Glover, Thomas, and Mastone met to discuss Plaintiff's absences. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 39). It is disputed whether Glover discussed with Thomas and Mastone that Plaintiff had been suffering from a migraine the previous week. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 40; Doc. 96 at ¶ 40). After receiving input from Glover and Mastone, Thomas made the decision to terminate Plaintiff as a result of her absences on March 17, May 22, and May 25. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 41; Doc. 96 at ¶ 41). Thomas was the final decisionmaker. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 42; Doc. 96 at ¶ 42). Glover disagreed with the decision to terminate Plaintiff, because she knew that Plaintiff had been suffering from a migraine and because Thomas had told [*10]  Plaintiff to leave work early to go to the doctor. (Doc. 82 at 107:19-25, 108:1-25, 109:1-5). Plaintiff was not terminated for any reason other than having accrued three occurrences related to absences from work on March 17, May 22, and May 25. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 49; see also Doc. 82-7).4 The parties dispute whether Thomas was aware of Plaintiff's migraine condition at the time she was terminated. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 50; Doc. 96 at ¶ 50).
The FMLA applied to employees of Defendant at the time that Plaintiff was terminated. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 59). In 2014, Plaintiff applied and was approved for leave under the FMLA for her own health condition, unrelated to migraines, and she took FMLA leave during 2014. (Doc. 77-1 at ¶¶ 44-47). During the time period at issue in this case, Thomas never gave Plaintiff FMLA paperwork to complete. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 64). Defendant's management did not discuss whether Plaintiff was entitled to an accommodation under the ADA or entitled to FMLA leave before she was terminated. Id. at ¶¶ 65, 66. At no point in May of 2017 did Plaintiff specifically ask for "FMLA leave." (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 48). During her employment with Defendant, Plaintiff never provided any written documentation [*11]  stating that she had migraines, a migraine condition, or a disability related to migraines. Id. at ¶ 51.
Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on July 19, 2017. (Doc. 76-20). The EEOC mailed Plaintiff her notice of right to sue in November of 2018. (Doc. 76-21).

5. Plaintiff's 2017 Bankruptcy Petition
On March 16, 2017, Plaintiff, with the assistance of counsel, filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Georgia. (Doc. 77-1 at ¶ 78). In her initial petition, under the "Schedule A/B: Property—30. Other Amounts Someone Owes You," Plaintiff listed that she had a judgment against an individual for $12,250.00. Id. at ¶ 79. In her initial petition, under the "Schedule A/B: Property—Item 33," Plaintiff was required to list claims against third parties, whether or not she had filed a lawsuit or made a demand for payment, and Plaintiff represented that she had none. Id. at ¶ 80. The docket in Plaintiff's bankruptcy case is devoid of any evidence that she ever amended her bankruptcy petition. Id. at ¶ 81. Plaintiff states that the meeting of the creditors in that bankruptcy [*12]  proceeding was held on April 25, 2017, one month before her termination. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 81). She states that she moved to voluntarily dismiss her bankruptcy case on November 21, 2018, which was granted on November 25, 2018. Id.

II. DISCUSSION

A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is authorized when the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show "that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Baas v. Fewless, 886 F.3d 1088, 1091 (11th Cir. 2018). The movant carries this burden by showing the court "that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. In making its determination, the court must view the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Crane v. Lifemark Hospitals, Inc., 898 F.3d 1130, 1134 (11th Cir. 2018).
Once the moving party has adequately supported its motion, the non-moving party must come forward with specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The non-moving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence [*13]  designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted). Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the non-moving party's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment; rather, there must be evidence on which a jury could reasonably find for the non-moving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The non-moving party cannot defeat summary judgment by relying upon conclusory assertions. Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1564 n. 6 (11th Cir. 1997). Rather, "[a] party asserting that a fact...is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by...citing to particular parts of materials in the record." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); see also Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995) (en banc) ("There is no burden upon the district court to distill every potential argument that could be made based upon the materials before it on summary judgment.").
If a fact is found to be material, the court must also consider the genuineness of the alleged factual dispute. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50. A factual dispute is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Id. A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. at 248. Moreover, [*14]  for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The non-moving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Id. at 587 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict: "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 259 (internal quotation marks omitted).
When considering motions for summary judgment, the court does not make decisions as to the merits of disputed factual issues. See id. at 249; Ryder Int'l Corp. v. First Am. Nat'l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, the court only determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried. Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those that are irrelevant. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do not resolve or affect the outcome of a suit will not preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id.

B. Motion for Summary Judgment
In Count One of the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant [*15]  discriminated against her and failed to accommodate her in violation of the ADA. (Doc 1 at ¶¶ 44-51). She alleges that she is a qualified individual with a disability who requested the accommodation of intermittent leave, which Defendant denied. Id. In Count Two, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant discriminated against her in violation of the ADA when Defendant terminated her because it regarded her as being disabled. Id. at ¶¶ 52-55. In Count Three, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the ADA by retaliating against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation. Id. at ¶¶ 56-66. In Count Four, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant interfered with her rights under the FMLA by failing to provide her with FMLA paperwork for FMLA-qualifying leave and terminating her employment to avoid providing her with leave. Id. at ¶¶ 67-74. In Count Five, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant retaliated against her in violation of the FMLA by failing to provide her with FMLA paperwork for FMLA-qualifying leave, terminating her to avoid providing her with FMLA leave, and terminating her for absences legally covered by the FMLA. Id. at ¶¶ 75-82. Defendant moves for summary judgment as to all claims. (Doc. [*16]  77 at 1).

1. Defendant's Arguments for Summary Judgment and Plaintiff's Responses
In its brief, Defendant argues that Defendant was not aware that Plaintiff had a disability and suffered from migraines. (Doc. 78 at 13-14). Even if Plaintiff's supervisors were aware that Plaintiff suffered from migraines, Defendant asserts that this did not put Defendant on notice that Plaintiff needed an accommodation under the ADA, and Plaintiff never made any request for a reasonable accommodation. Id. at 14-18, 27-28. Defendant further argues that Plaintiff provided no notice of a serious medical condition under the FMLA and did not request FMLA leave. Id. at 18-22. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff has not alleged any facts from which a jury could conclude that Defendant regarded her as disabled. Id. at 22-23. It contends that it cannot be liable for retaliation under the ADA or FMLA because it had no awareness that Plaintiff was disabled or suffering from a serious medical condition. Id. at 23-25. Defendant also argues that summary judgment should be granted on all counts because Plaintiff failed to disclose the instant claims in her bankruptcy proceeding, meaning that she is estopped from pursuing [*17]  them here. Id. at 25-27.
In response, Plaintiff argues that she has established genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment on her ADA discrimination claim, specifically regarding whether Defendant knew that Plaintiff was disabled and whether she requested an accommodation. (Doc. 88 at 5-14). She asserts, as to her ADA and FMLA retaliation claims, that she has met her prima facie burden and that Defendant has failed to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory basis for terminating her. Id. at 14-16, 20-22. She argues, as to her FMLA interference claim, that she has met her burden to show that Defendant had sufficient notice of her health condition and that the factual disputes as to whether her communications to her supervisors constituted adequate notice must be resolved by a jury. Id. at 16-20. Plaintiff asserts that she is not judicially estopped from pursuing her claims due to her bankruptcy position because there is no evidence that she intended to make a mockery of the judicial system and because she voluntarily dismissed her bankruptcy petition and did not gain an unfair advantage. Id. at 22-25.
In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff still has not specified [*18]  the leave or accommodation she claims to have requested. (Doc. 97 at 3-5). It contends that she never actually requested leave or accommodation and thus did not trigger Defendant's obligations under the ADA or FMLA. Id. at 5-8. Defendant reiterates its arguments that Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim fails because Defendant was unaware of Plaintiff's alleged protected conduct. Id. at 9-10. Defendant contends that Plaintiff should be subject to judicial estoppel because she benefitted from her bankruptcy petition, despite the fact that she dismissed it. Id. at 10-11.

2. Bankruptcy
The Court first considers Defendant's argument that summary judgment should be granted as to all of Plaintiff's claims on the basis of judicial estoppel because Plaintiff failed to disclose the claims that she brings in this case in her prior bankruptcy proceeding. "The equitable doctrine of judicial estoppel is intended to protect courts against parties who seek to manipulate the judicial process by changing their legal positions to suit the exigencies of the moment." Slater v. U.S. Steel Corp., 871 F.3d 1174, 1176 (11th Cir. 2017) (en banc). The Eleventh Circuit "employs a two-part test to guide district courts in applying judicial estoppel: whether (1) the party took [*19]  an inconsistent position under oath in a separate proceeding, and (2) these inconsistent positions were calculated to make a mockery of the judicial system." Id. at 1181 (internal quotation marks omitted). "Under this test, a district court considers both the plaintiff's actions—whether he made inconsistent statements—and his motive—whether he intended to make a mockery of the judicial system." Id.
The Eleventh Circuit has held that, when presented with the scenario where "a plaintiff takes inconsistent positions by pursuing in district court a civil claim that he failed to disclose as an asset in his bankruptcy proceedings," a district court "should consider all the facts and circumstances of the case ... when determining whether a plaintiff who failed to disclose a civil lawsuit in bankruptcy filings intended to make a mockery of the judicial system." Id. at 1176. Courts should look to factors such as "the plaintiff's level of sophistication, his explanation for the omission, whether he subsequently corrected the disclosures, and any action taken by the bankruptcy court concerning the nondisclosure." Id. at 1177 (noting further that the fact that "the plaintiff acted voluntarily, in the sense that he knew of his [*20]  civil claim when completing the disclosure forms" does not alone "necessarily establish a calculated attempt to undermine the judicial process").
Here, Plaintiff, with the assistance of counsel, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 on March 16, 2017, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Georgia. (Doc. 77-1 at ¶ 78; see also In re Kenita Tyesha Burton, Bankruptcy Case No. 17-20200-MJK, Doc. 1). In her initial petition, under the "Schedule A/B: Property—30. Other Amounts Someone Owes You," Plaintiff listed that she had a judgment against an individual for $12,250.00. (Doc. 77-1 at ¶ 79; see also No. 17-20200-MJK, Doc. 1 at 13). In her initial petition, under the "Schedule A/B: Property—Item 33," Plaintiff was required to list claims against third parties, whether or not she had filed a lawsuit or made a demand for payment, and Plaintiff represented that she had none. (Doc. 77-1 at ¶ 80; see also No. 17-20200-MJK, Doc. 1 at 13). The meeting of the creditors was held on April 20, 2017. (No. 17-20200-MJK, Doc. 19). Plaintiff's bankruptcy petition did not include her claims raised in this case, which is not surprising given that her petition was filed more than [*21]  two months before her termination, and the meeting of the creditors was held over a month before her termination. However, the docket in Plaintiff's bankruptcy case does not reflect that she ever amended her bankruptcy petition after her termination to include the claims raised in this case. (See generally No. 17-20200-MJK). She moved to voluntarily dismiss her bankruptcy case on November 21, 2018, which was granted on November 26, 2018. (No. 17-20200-MJK, Docs. 49, 50). Plaintiff filed the complaint in this matter on February 12, 2019. (Doc. 1).
Defendant argues that this case is "exactly" like Henderson v. Franklin, 782 F. App'x 866 (11th Cir. 2019), where the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment based on judicial estoppel. The Court disagrees. In Henderson, the plaintiff filed his civil complaint while his bankruptcy case was ongoing, later amended his bankruptcy petition to add creditors without amending it to include his ongoing civil case, and received a discharge of his debts. Id. at 868-69. Here, however, while Plaintiff clearly meets the first step of the Eleventh Circuit's two-part test because she took an inconsistent position under oath in her bankruptcy proceeding by not amending her petition to include [*22]  her employment law claims, the Court cannot conclude, looking at "all the facts and circumstances of the case," that Plaintiff "intended to make a mockery of the judicial system." Slater, 871 F.3d at 1176, 1181.
Plaintiff filed her bankruptcy petition and had the meeting of the creditors over a month before her employment claims even came into existence in May of 2017, when her alleged ADA/FMLA absences occurred and Defendant terminated her. (No. 17-20200-MJK, Docs. 1, 19). While Plaintiff failed to amend her petition after she was terminated (when her civil claims came into existence), she did not otherwise amend her petition and fail to include the civil claims, as the plaintiff in Henderson did. (See generally No. 17-20200-MJK). Most importantly, unlike in Henderson, Plaintiff did not receive a discharge of her debts; rather, she voluntarily dismissed her bankruptcy petition. (No. 17-20200-MJK, Docs. 49, 50). Even before Slater, courts in this circuit held that judicial estoppel should not apply to plaintiffs who did not receive a discharge of their debts in bankruptcy, as Plaintiff did not here. See Strauss v. Rent-A-Center, Inc., 192 F. App'x 821, 823 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding that the plaintiff's nondisclosure of her employment action on her Chapter 13 petition was not calculated [*23]  to make a mockery of the judicial system where the bankruptcy court never entered an order discharging any of the plaintiff's debts); Carrio v. Apollo Grp., No. 1:07-CV-1814-BBM-RGV, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131552, 2008 WL 11407351, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 8, 2008) (finding, where the plaintiff sought and obtained dismissal of his bankruptcy proceeding prior to discharge after failing to disclose civil claims, that judicial estoppel "is not appropriate where the bankruptcy suit ended without discharge"), adopted by 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131543, 2008 WL 11407392 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 21, 2008).
Defendant argues, without citation to any caselaw, that Plaintiff did benefit from the dismissed bankruptcy petition because she testified that she never heard from any of her creditors again after the bankruptcy petition was dismissed. (Doc. 97 at 10-11). However, upon dismissal of a Chapter 13 petition without discharge, "the consequences of the bankruptcy petition are negated, and the parties are restored to their rights and positions as they existed prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case... the general effect of an order of dismissal is to restore the status quo ante; it is as though the bankruptcy case had never been brought." In re Crump, 467 B.R. 532, 535 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Eleventh Circuit has held that "judicial estoppel should apply only when the plaintiff's conduct is egregious enough that the [*24]  situation demands equitable intervention." Slater, 871 F.3d at 1187 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). The Court does not find that to be the case here, where Plaintiff filed her bankruptcy petition and had a payment plan approved before her undisclosed claims even existed, she did not amend her petition without including the instant claims, and she ultimately sought and obtained dismissal of her bankruptcy petition without discharge of her debts. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge decline to apply judicial estoppel to bar Plaintiff's claims.

3. ADA
The ADA prohibits an employer from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability" concerning hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation, training, job application procedures, or "other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The definition of discriminate includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). The term "disability" means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, [*25]  a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
"[T]here are two distinct categories of disability discrimination claims under the ADA: (1) failure to accommodate and (2) disparate treatment." E.E.O.C. v. Eckerd Corp., No. 1:10-CV-2816-JEC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91370, 2012 WL 2568225, at *4 (N.D. Ga. July 2, 2012). The ADA also "prohibits retaliation against an individual for opposing an unlawful practice or making a charge under the ADA." Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a)).
Courts examine ADA disparate-treatment claims under the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004). The initial burden is on the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing a disability, that she was otherwise qualified to perform her job, and that she was discriminated against based upon the disability. Id. The burden then shifts to the defendant to produce a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination or other adverse employment action. Id. If the defendant does so, the plaintiff must then show that this reason is unworthy of credence and a pretext for discrimination. Id.
The McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, however, is not applicable to reasonable accommodation cases. See Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that for a failure-to-accommodate claim, there are no "subsequent burdens on [defendant] [*26]  to show that it had any legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for terminating [plaintiff] or on [plaintiff] to establish that these reasons were pretextual" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Cappetta v. N. Fulton Eye Ctr., No. 1:15-CV-3412-LMM-JSA, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214906, 2017 WL 5197207, at *20 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 1, 2017) ("For those cases in which an employee claims that an employer violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability, however, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting framework does not apply."), adopted by 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214787, 2017 WL 5443877 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 7, 2017). To establish a prima facie case with respect to a reasonable accommodation claim, "a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she is disabled; (2) she was a 'qualified individual' when she suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) that she was discriminated against because of her disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow her to keep working." Cappetta, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214906, 2017 WL 5197207, at * 25; see also Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262-63.
And finally, for ADA retaliation claims, the full burden-shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas applies. Batson v. Salvation Army, 897 F.3d 1320, 1328-29 (11th Cir. 2018). "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation ... an employee must demonstrate (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected conduct, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that a causal connection exists [*27]  between the two." Id. at 1329. If the employee establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason. Id. If the employer does so, the burden shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the employer's reason is pretextual. Id.
The Court will analyze each of Plaintiff's ADA claims in turn.

a. Failure to Accommodate - Count One
Plaintiff's first ADA claim asserts that Defendant failed to provide Plaintiff with reasonable accommodations as the ADA requires. (Doc 1 at ¶¶ 44-51). To establish a prima facie case with respect to a reasonable accommodation claim, "a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she is disabled; (2) she was a 'qualified individual' when she suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) that she was discriminated against because of her disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow her to keep working." Cappetta, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214906, 2017 WL 5197207, at * 25; see also Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262-63.
For the purposes of its summary judgment motion, Defendant does not appear to dispute that Plaintiff's migraine condition would constitute a disability under the ADA nor does Defendant provide the Court with any reason to suggest that it disputes that Plaintiff was a qualified individual under the [*28]  ADA. (See Doc. 78 at 12-25, 27-28).5 So the critical question is whether Plaintiff has established the third factor—that she was denied a reasonable accommodation. "An employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer fails to provide 'reasonable accommodations' for the disability—unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the employer." McCarroll v. Somerby of Mobile, LLC, 595 F. App'x 897, 899 (11th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). "But 'the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made.'" Id. (quoting Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999)).
Defendant first contends that neither Thomas (the decisionmaker) nor Mastone had any knowledge that Plaintiff suffered from migraines until after her termination and, therefore, Defendant had no notice of Plaintiff's disability. (Doc. 78 at 13-14). The Court finds this argument unavailing because the parties fundamentally disagree about whether Thomas (and Mastone) were aware of Plaintiff's migraines prior to her termination. (Compare Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 40 with Doc. 96 at ¶ 40). Plaintiff's testimony is that she heard Glover tell Thomas (on a speakerphone call on May 24) that Plaintiff was suffering from a migraine, had [*29]  vomited at work, and needed to leave to go to the emergency room. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 25, 26). And Glover's testimony is that she discussed the fact that Plaintiff was suffering from a migraine during her May absences from work with Thomas and Mastone before the decision was made to terminate Plaintiff. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 40, 50; see also Doc. 77-1 at ¶ 54). Defendant, on the other hand, cites Thomas's and Mastone's testimony that they did not learn about Plaintiff's migraine condition until after her termination. (Doc. 77-1 at ¶¶ 56, 57). At the summary judgment stage, the Court cannot conclude that Defendant's version of the facts is more credible. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. Because the facts on the issue of whether Defendant (particularly Thomas, the decisionmaker) had notice of Plaintiff's migraine condition are materially in dispute, Defendant's argument that it is entitled to summary judgment on Count One because it had no knowledge of Plaintiff's condition fails.
Defendant next contends that, even if Glover, Mastone, and Thomas were aware in late May that Plaintiff suffered from migraines, this awareness did not put Defendant on notice that Plaintiff needed an accommodation for migraines under the ADA. [*30]  (Doc. 78 at 14-18). Defendant relies on Kuykendall v. Leader Commc'ns, Inc., No. CIV-19-480-F, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83430 , 2020 WL 2461481 (W.D. Okla. May 12, 2020), to support its argument that Plaintiff did not sufficiently request an accommodation. Id. at 14-17. In Kuykendall, the defendant employer alleged that it had made the decision to terminate the plaintiff for performance issues, but the plaintiff texted her supervisor the following day that she was suffering from a migraine and would not be in to work. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83430, 2020 WL 2461481, at *3-4. The plaintiff was absent from work for the remainder of the week and told her supervisor via text message that "we are going to have to have a discussion about accommodations when I am back about these issues" and that she would be sending an email "to request to start the interactive process for reasonable accommodations should I still have a job when I return." 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83430 [WL] at *4 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff was ultimately terminated on the first day that she returned to work for the pre-existing performance issues. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83430, [WL] at *4-5. The court in Kuykendall granted summary judgment on the plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim, finding that the text messages did not provide notice to the defendant that the plaintiff was seeking approved time off of work due to her migraine. Id. at *10.
 [*31] While there are similarities, the Court finds that there are key differences between Kuykendall and the instant case—most importantly, the plaintiff in Kuykendall did not provide any medical documentation about her absences and her text messages did not seek approved time off. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83430, [WL] at *3-5. Here, however, the undisputed facts reflect that Plaintiff provided notes from the emergency room (ER) doctors for each of her May of 2017 absences, which requested that Plaintiff be excused from work for one and three days, respectively. (Docs. 82-3, 82-4).6 Further, there are disputes of material fact regarding what Plaintiff told her supervisors and what she requested. The parties agree that Plaintiff called and texted her immediate supervisor, Glover, before the start of her shift on Monday May 22, 2017, and informed Glover that she was ill. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 20; Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 17). However, the parties dispute whether Plaintiff told Glover that she was specifically suffering from a migraine and had been in the ER the day before, whether Plaintiff asked Glover for permission to take the day off because of her migraine, and whether Glover was authorized to and did give permission for Plaintiff to have the day off. (See Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 18; Doc. 96 at ¶ 18; see also Doc. 82 at 79:16-80:13 (Glover's deposition testimony that Plaintiff told her during the May 22 telephone call that she wasn't feeling well but that Plaintiff did not say that she was suffering from a migraine or that she had been in the ER); Doc. 85 at 35:4-10, 39:2-6 (Plaintiff's deposition testimony that she told Glover during the May 22 telephone call that she would not be able to come into work because she had a migraine and that she had gone to the ER)). The parties do not dispute, as to Plaintiff's absences later that week, that Plaintiff informed Glover that she had vomited at work on May 24 due to a migraine and needed to leave to go to the ER (and that Glover informed Thomas at least of the vomiting and need to go to the ER). (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 26; Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 23, 25; Doc. 82 at 92:6-17). But they do dispute whether Glover advised Thomas that Plaintiff was suffering from a migraine on May 24 and whether Thomas was ever aware of Plaintiff's migraine condition prior to her termination. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 40, 50; see also Doc. 77-1 at ¶¶ 54, 56, 57).
The Court finds that the instant case is more analogous to Menefee v. Action Res., LLC, No. 2:18-cv-01208-CLM, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233884, 2020 WL 7343992 (N.D. Ala. Dec. 14, 2020). In Menefee, the plaintiff (who had chronic migraines) was in a car wreck on the day that she was supposed to return to work from approved medical leave related to brain surgery. Id. at *1. The plaintiff went to the ER after the car wreck and left the ER with a nurse's note advising that she should not return to work for three days. Id. The plaintiff gave this note to her employer's human resources department, but she was terminated the following day. Id. The court in Menefee noted that although "the Eleventh Circuit has not specified what form a request for reasonable accommodations must take," the circuit has held that "the demand must be specific enough to put the employer on notice as to the employee's desire for an accommodation." Id. at *5 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Adigun v. Express Scripts, Inc., 742 F. App'x 474, 477 (11th Cir. 2018) (holding that, although a leave of absence can be a reasonable accommodation in some cases, the plaintiff's form did not provide a specific date on when she could return to work)). The court in Menefee found [*32]  that a reasonable juror could find that the nurse's note "contained a request for a reasonable accommodation" and "put [the defendant] on notice that medical personnel thought that time off ... [was] needed to allow [the plaintiff] to work through migraines." Id. at *6.
The Court finds Menefee persuasive. Here, as discussed above, there is a dispute of fact as to whether Defendant was aware of Plaintiff's migraine condition. As it must at summary judgment, the Court resolves this conflict by presuming that Plaintiff's evidence is true and that she informed Glover and Thomas of her migraines. Assuming that the decisionmaker, Thomas, knew of Plaintiff's migraines and that she was missing work to go to the ER due to her migraines, a reasonable juror could find that the two doctors' notes "contained a request for a reasonable accommodation," namely, the leave requested in the doctors' notes. Menefee,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233884, 2020 WL 7343992, at *6.
Plaintiff also must prove that the accommodation she requested was reasonable. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997). The ER notes that Plaintiff provided to Defendant excused her from work for a total of four days. (Docs. 82-3, 82-4). The Eleventh Circuit has held that a leave of absence may be a reasonable accommodation, so long as the leave [*33]  is not for an indefinite period. See Santandreu v. Miami Dade Cnty., 513 F. App'x 902, 905 (11th Cir. 2013). A reasonable juror could find that Plaintiff's requested accommodation was reasonable, and Defendant offers no argument that an accommodation consisting of the leave of absence reflected in the ER notes would have been an undue hardship.
In sum, a reasonable juror could decide the failure to accommodate prong of Plaintiff's prima facie case for either party based on the evidence presented. Therefore, summary judgment is not warranted, as there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute, and the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be DENIED as to Count One.

b. Retaliation — Count Three
For ease of analysis, the Court next turns to Count Three. In Count Three, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the ADA by retaliating against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation. (Doc 1 at ¶¶ 56-66). For ADA retaliation claims, the full burden-shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas applies. See Batson, 897 F.3d at 1328-29. "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation ... an employee must demonstrate (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected conduct, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that a causal connection exists [*34]  between the two." Id. at 1329. If the employee establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a non-discriminatory reason. Id. If the employer does so, the burden shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the employer's reason is pretextual. Id.
Here, Defendant only discusses the third prong, arguing that "[t]here can be no causal connection where the defendant was never aware of a disability." (Doc. 78 at 23). However, as discussed above, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Thomas (the decisionmaker) had knowledge of Plaintiff's migraine condition prior to her termination. (Compare Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 40 with Doc. 96 at ¶ 40). Plaintiff's testimony is that she heard Glover tell Thomas (on a speakerphone call on May 24) that Plaintiff was suffering from a migraine, had vomited at work, and needed to leave to go to the emergency room. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 25, 26). Plaintiff also states that she called Thomas on the evening of May 24 and on May 25 to update him on her anticipated absence from work and the status of her migraine condition. Id. at ¶¶ 31, 34. And Glover's testimony is that she discussed the fact that Plaintiff was suffering from a migraine [*35]  during her May absences with Thomas before the decision was made to terminate Plaintiff. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 40, 50; see also Doc. 77-1 at ¶ 54). Defendant, on the other hand, cites Thomas's testimony that he did not learn about Plaintiff's migraine condition until after her termination. (Doc. 77-1 at ¶ 57). At the summary judgment stage, the Court cannot conclude that Defendant's version of the facts is more credible. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.
Because the facts on the issue of whether Defendant had notice of Plaintiff's migraine condition are materially in dispute, Defendant's argument that it is entitled to summary judgment on Count Three because it had no knowledge of Plaintiff's condition fails.7 There is at least an issue of fact with regard to whether Plaintiff engaged in a protected activity by letting Defendant know that she needed to visit the ER and be absent from work under doctors' orders due to her migraine on May 22 and May 25. See Hein v. IMS Gear Holding, Inc., No. 2:16-CV-00081-RWS-JCF, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112965, 2018 WL 1833254, at *24 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 31, 2018) (finding that an issue of fact existed as to a claim of retaliation under the ADA and noting that "[t]he Eleventh Circuit has recognized that a leave of absence can be a reasonable accommodation ... and as such, request for medical leave to ameliorate the effects [*36]  of a disability would certainly be protected from retaliation by the ADA" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)), adopted by 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112964, 2018 WL 1882813 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 27, 2018). Because there is a material factual dispute about what notice Defendant had and because Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Count Three is premised solely on the argument that it had no notice of Plaintiff's alleged disability, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be DENIED as to Count Three.

c. Disability Discrimination (Regarded as Being Disabled)— Count Two
In Count Two, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant discriminated against her in violation of the ADA when it terminated her because it regarded her as being disabled. (Doc 1 at ¶¶ 52-55). Courts examine ADA disparate-treatment claims under the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas. See Cleveland, 369 F.3d at 1193. The initial burden is on the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing a disability (or that she was regarding as having a disability), that she was otherwise qualified to perform her job, and that she was discriminated against based upon the disability. Id. The burden then shifts to the defendant to produce [*37]  a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination or other adverse employment action. Id. If the defendant does so, the plaintiff must then show that this reason is unworthy of credence and a pretext for discrimination. Id. Specifically as to the "regarded as having" definition, "[a]n individual meets the requirement of 'being regarded as having such an impairment' if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A). "In short, to qualify for coverage under the 'regarded as' prong, an individual is not subject to any functional test and is not required to establish his employer's beliefs concerning the severity of the impairment." Jordan v. City of Union City, 94 F. Supp. 3d 1328, 1336 (N.D. Ga. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). "To defeat summary judgment on this element, Plaintiff is only required to raise a genuine issue of material fact about whether [her] employer regarded [her] as having a mental or physical impairment." Id. (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).
Defendant's argument for summary judgment on this count [*38]  is exceedingly brief and, again, focuses solely on Defendant's assertion that Thomas and Mastone were unaware of Plaintiff's migraines prior to her termination.8 (Doc. 78 at 22-23 ("[The] decisionmakers testified that they were unaware of Ms. Burton's migraines or any other potentially serious medical condition ... Count Two thus fails.")); see also Resolution Trust Corp., 43 F.3d at 599 ("There is no burden upon the district court to distill every potential argument that could be made based upon the materials before it on summary judgment. Rather, the onus is upon the parties to formulate arguments...." (internal citation omitted)). However, the Court has found above that there is a genuine issue of material fact about whether Defendant knew about Plaintiff's migraine condition prior to her termination. See, supra, sections II.B.3.a and II.B.3.b. Thus, at this stage, Plaintiff has raised a genuine dispute of material fact about whether she was regarded as physically disabled by Defendant. The undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be DENIED as to Count Two.

4. FMLA
The FMLA grants an eligible employee the right to take up to twelve workweeks of unpaid leave during any twelve-month period for [*39]  any one or more of several reasons, including "[b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D); see also Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir. 2006). A "serious health condition" means "an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves—(A) inpatient care...or (B) continuing treatment by a health care provider." 29 U.S.C. § 2611(11). An employer may not "interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise" any right provided for under the FMLA, nor may an employer "discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful" by the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2615(a)(1) and (2).
An employee may assert two types of FMLA claims: "interference claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act, and retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act." Jones v. Gulf Coast Health Care of Del., LLC, 854 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). To establish an FMLA interference claim, "an employee need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled [*40]  to the benefit denied." Strickland v. Water Works and Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1206-07 (11th Cir. 2001). For retaliation claims, in the absence of direct evidence of retaliatory intent, the Court applies the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis. Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207. Under that framework, Plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that: (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity under the FMLA; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal link between the exercise of her rights under the FMLA and the adverse employment action. Id.; see also Jones, 854 F.3d at 1271; Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1297. If the employee meets this burden, the employer must then come forward with a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1297. The burden then shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the employer's asserted reason is pretextual. Id.

a. Interference—Count Four
In Count Four, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant interfered with her rights under the FMLA by failing to provide her with FMLA paperwork for FMLA-qualifying leave and terminating her employment to avoid providing her with leave. (Doc 1 at ¶¶ 67-74). To establish an FMLA interference claim, "an employee need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the benefit denied." [*41]  Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1206-07. Defendant contends that this claim fails because Plaintiff never provided notice that she was requesting leave sufficient to trigger FMLA protections. (Doc. 78 at 18-22).9
"An employee's notice of her need for FMLA leave must satisfy two criteria—timing and content—both of which differ depending on whether the need for leave is foreseeable or unforeseeable." White v. Beltram Edge Tool Supply, Inc., 789 F.3d 1188, 1195 (11th Cir. 2015). As to timing, "[i]f an employee's need for leave is foreseeable, she must give her employer at least 30 days' advance notice, unless giving 30 days' notice is impracticable, in which case the employee must give only 'such notice as is practicable.'" Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2612(e)(2)). "If, on the other hand, an employee's need for leave is unforeseeable, the 30-day requirement does not apply." Id. (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). "[A]n employee [whose need for leave is unforeseeable] must provide notice to the employer as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case." 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(a).
As to the content of the employee's notice, the Eleventh Circuit has held that, "[a]s a general rule, an employee need not explicitly mention the FMLA when giving notice to her employer." [*42]  White, 789 F.3d at 1196; see also Cruz v. Publix Super Mkts., Inc., 428 F.3d 1379, 1383 (11th Cir. 2005) ("An employee is not required to assert expressly her right to take leave under the FMLA."). The Eleventh Circuit has also held that:
[T]he FMLA and its regulations do require that the notice convey certain information. Again, the content requirement differs depending on whether an employee's need for leave is foreseeable or unforeseeable. If the need for leave is foreseeable, an employee must give her employer notice that is "sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and [of] the anticipated timing and duration of the leave." [29 C.F.R.] § 825.302(c). If the need for leave is unforeseeable, an employee need only "provide sufficient information for [her] employer to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request." [29 C.F.R.] § 825.303(b).
White, 789 F.3d at 1196 (third and fifth alterations added). "[N]either the FMLA nor its implementing regulations defines the terms 'foreseeable' and 'unforeseeable.'" Id. (discussing that courts "usually speak in terms of whether the need for leave itself was foreseeable"). In White, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that "an employee's need for leave is foreseeable if it is based on planned medical treatment." Id. Here, there is no evidence [*43]  or argument that Plaintiff's need for leave due to her migraines was based on planned medical treatment. Thus, Plaintiff's need for leave was unforeseeable, and she was not required to give advance notice. See id. at 1195.
Because Plaintiff's need for leave was unforeseeable, she was required to give notice only as early as was practicable, see 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(a), and her notice had to contain only "sufficient information for [Defendant] to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request," id. at § 825.303(b). The Court finds that, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, she did give notice as early as was practicable and there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her notice contained sufficient information.
Plaintiff called and texted her immediate supervisor, Glover, on Monday May 22, 2017, to inform Glover that she was ill. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 20; Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 17). There is a dispute of fact about whether Plaintiff told Glover that she was specifically suffering from a migraine and had been in the emergency room the day before, whether Plaintiff asked Glover for permission to take the day off because of her migraine, and whether Glover was authorized to and did [*44]  give permission for Plaintiff to have the day off. (See Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 18; Doc. 96 at ¶ 18; see also Doc. 82 at 79:16-80:13 (Glover's deposition testimony that Plaintiff told her during the May 22 telephone call that she wasn't feeling well but that Plaintiff did not say that she was suffering from a migraine or that she had been in the emergency room); Doc. 85 at 35:4-10, 39:2-6 (Plaintiff's deposition testimony that she told Glover during the May 22 telephone call that she would not be able to come into work because she had a migraine and that she had gone to the emergency room)).
On Wednesday May 24, 2017, Plaintiff reported for work, but she informed Glover that she had to leave work early because she had vomited at work due to a migraine. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 26; Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 23; Doc. 82 at 92:6-17). Glover called Thomas to advise him that Plaintiff was suffering from a migraine, had vomited at work, and needed to leave work to seek medical treatment at the emergency room. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 25).10 The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff was in the room when Glover called Thomas, that Thomas agreed that Plaintiff could leave work to go to the hospital, and that Thomas stated on the call [*45]  that Plaintiff would not get into trouble for leaving work early. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 26, 27, 28; Doc. 96 at ¶¶ 26, 27, 28; see also Doc. 82 at 99:16-24 (Glover's deposition testimony that Thomas said that Plaintiff would not get into trouble for leaving work early)).11 On each occasion, when Plaintiff returned to work, she brought a doctor's note from the ER excusing her from work for a specific period of time. (Doc. 88-3 at ¶¶ 23, 28; Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 19, 30; see also Docs. 82-3, 82-4).
The Court finds that there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether this satisfies the FMLA's two notice criteria. Giving notice the day that Plaintiff would be absent from work (and providing doctors' notes on the very next day she was at work) assuredly meets the timing standard of practicability. And, construing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable juror could determine that the content of Plaintiff's notice was also sufficient. She alleges that she told her direct supervisor that she had been in the emergency room due to a migraine and then later told her direct supervisor (whom Plaintiff asserts that she heard tell the decisionmaker) that she had vomited [*46]  at work due to a migraine and needed to leave work to go the emergency room. (Doc. 85 at 35:4-10, 39:2-6; Doc. 88-3 at ¶ 26; Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 23, 25; Doc. 82 at 92:6-17).
Defendant argues that saying she was sick or ill is insufficient notice under the FMLA and asserts that Plaintiff only referred to a migraine on May 24. (Doc. 78 at 19). However, as discussed extensively above, there is a fundamental factual dispute in this case about what Plaintiff said, when she said it, and to whom. Plaintiff alleges that she did more than just say she was sick—rather, she told her supervisor on May 22 that she had been in the ER due to a migraine, which is why she was unable to come to work, and she again told her supervisor (who Plaintiff alleges in turn told Thomas) that she was suffering from a migraine and needed to leave work to go to the ER. This is a disputed question of fact that the Court cannot resolve in Defendant's favor at the summary-judgment stage. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. Defendant also contends that Plaintiff's notice was insufficient because "she did not ask anyone for FMLA leave." (Doc. 78 at 19). However, "[a]s a general rule, an employee need not explicitly mention the FMLA when giving notice [*47]  to her employer." White, 789 F.3d at 1196; see also Cruz, 428 F.3d at 1383 ("An employee is not required to assert expressly her right to take leave under the FMLA.").12
For purposes of Defendant's motion for summary judgment, the Court finds that there is a disputed fact question as to whether Plaintiff's notice was sufficient and did not disqualify her from taking FMLA leave. Thus, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be DENIED as to Count Four.

b. Retaliation—Count Five
In Count Five, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant retaliated against her in violation of the FMLA by failing to provide her with FMLA paperwork for FMLA-qualifying leave, terminating her to avoid providing her with FMLA leave, and terminating her for absences legally covered by the FMLA. (Doc 1 at ¶¶ 75-82). Defendant's arguments for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim are the same as its arguments as to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim, namely, that there can be no causal connection because Defendant was never aware of a serious medical condition. (Doc. 78 at 23-25).
For FMLA retaliation claims, as with ADA retaliation claims, in the absence of direct evidence of retaliatory intent, the Court applies the McDonnell [*48]  Douglas burden-shifting analysis. Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207 (discussing FMLA retaliation claims); see also Batson, 897 F.3d at 1328-29 (holding that the full burden-shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas applies to ADA and FMLA retaliation claims). Under that framework, Plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that: (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity under the FMLA; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal link between the exercise of her rights under the FMLA and the adverse employment action. Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207; see also Jones, 854 F.3d at 1271; Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1297. If the employee meets this burden, the employer must then come forward with a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1297. The burden then shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the employer's asserted reason is pretextual. Id.
Here, Defendant's argument fails for the same reasons discussed above with respect to Count Three. See, supra, section II.B.3.b. Defendant only discusses the third prong, arguing that "[t]here can be no causal connection where the defendant was never aware of a ... serious medical condition." (Doc. 78 at 23). However, as discussed above, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Thomas (the [*49]  decisionmaker) had knowledge of Plaintiff's migraine condition prior to her termination. (Compare Doc. 88-4 at ¶ 40 with Doc. 96 at ¶ 40). Plaintiff's testimony is that she heard Glover tell Thomas (on a speakerphone call on May 24) that Plaintiff was suffering from a migraine, had vomited at work, and needed to leave to go to the emergency room. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 25, 26). Plaintiff also states that she called Thomas on the evening of May 24 and on May 25 to update him on her anticipated absence from work and the status of her migraine condition. Id. at ¶¶ 31, 34. And Glover's testimony is that she discussed the fact that Plaintiff was suffering from a migraine during her May absences from work with Thomas and Mastone before the decision was made to terminate Plaintiff. (Doc. 88-4 at ¶¶ 40, 50; see also Doc. 77-1 at ¶ 54). Defendant, on the other hand, cites Thomas's testimony that he did not learn about Plaintiff's migraine condition until after her termination. (Doc. 77-1 at ¶ 57). At the summary judgment stage, the Court cannot conclude that Defendant's version of the facts is more credible. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.
Because the facts on the issue of whether Defendant had notice of Plaintiff's migraine [*50]  condition are materially in dispute, Defendant's argument that it is entitled to summary judgment on Count Three because it had no knowledge of Plaintiff's condition fails.13 There is at least an issue of fact with regard to whether Plaintiff engaged in protected activity by letting Defendant know that she needed to visit the ER and be absent from work under doctors' orders due to her migraine on May 22 and May 25. Because there is a material factual dispute about what notice Defendant had, and Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Count Five is premised solely on the argument that it had no notice of Plaintiff's alleged serious health condition, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment should be DENIED as to Count Five.

III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion for leave to file three excess pages in its brief in support of summary judgment, (Doc. 98), is GRANTED, and the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 77), be DENIED in its entirety.
Because this case presents no other issues referred to Magistrate Judges pursuant to Standing Order 18-01, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate [*51]  the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO ORDERED AND RECOMMENDED, this 29th day of January, 2021.
