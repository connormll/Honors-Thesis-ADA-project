Opinion



ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION (Doc. No. 27)
Presently pending before the Court is Defendant Transdev Services, Inc.'s ("Transdev") motion for summary adjudication, which urges the Court to grant judgment on Plaintiff's first through fifth claims. (Doc. No. 27.) The motion has been fully briefed. (Docs. No. 29 & 30.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendant's motion for summary adjudication.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff brings this action against Transdev for disability discrimination after Transdev allegedly failed to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation. (See Complaint ("Compl."), Doc. No. 1-2.) Plaintiff was an employee of Transdev at all relevant times and had a medical condition [*2]  limiting his major life activities, requiring he be given accommodations at work. (Id. ¶¶ 24-25.) In 2010, Transdev hired Plaintiff as a Bus Driver. (Id. ¶ 13.) On or around May 2014, Plaintiff reported that he was experiencing a work-related injury to his arm, trunk, and leg, in addition to anxiety and stress, which resulted in a workers' compensation claim. (Id. ¶ 14.) Due to this injury, Plaintiff began a leave of absence on May 5, 2014. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 5.) Plaintiff's leave was initially designated as protective under the Family and Medical Leave Act and California Family Rights Act, which expired on July 31, 2014. (Id.) Thereafter, Plaintiff's leave was extended several times as a reasonable accommodation. (Id.)
On or around June 6, 2017, Plaintiff was examined by a Qualified Medical Examiner ("QME"), Michael Blott, D.C. (Id.) On or around June 12, 2017, Dr. Blott determined Plaintiff was restricted to "limited lifting, pushing, pulling up to 30 pounds, limited frequent lifting or carrying up to 10 pounds, limited standing or walking up to 6 hours per 8-hour day, sitting less than 6 hours per 8-hour day, no sitting for more than 2 hours without change of activity for 30 minutes." [*3]  (Compl. ¶ 15.) According to the QME, Plaintiff's work restrictions were expected to remain in effect for at least one year. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 5.) It is undisputed that these work restrictions prevented Plaintiff from performing his work as a Bus Driver. (Id.) Thereafter, on September 27, 2017, Plaintiff provided Transdev with a work status report from Plaintiff's primary treating physician, Dr. Blake Thompson ("Dr. Thompson"), which conflicted with the previous work restrictions issued by the QME. (Id.) Transdev informed Plaintiff that it was waiting for updated restrictions from the QME, and that once those were received, Plaintiff's employment status would be determined. (Id.)
On or around November 1, 2017, Plaintiff provided an updated report from Dr. Thompson which cleared Plaintiff to full duty. (Compl. ¶ 17.) Transdev responded once more, informing Plaintiff of the QME's work restrictions, that it had informed Plaintiff's attorney that those restrictions could not be accommodated, and that Plaintiff should consult with his attorney. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 5-6.) On or around December 26, 2017, Plaintiff's attorney requested that Transdev either return Plaintiff to work or engage in [*4]  an interactive process to facilitate his return to work. (Compl. ¶ 19.) It is undisputed that on April 3, 2018, Plaintiff signed a document entitled "Voluntary Resignation Statement" wherein he voluntarily resigned from his employment with Transdev. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 13.) Before Plaintiff signed it, the Voluntary Resignation Statement was translated from English to Spanish by an interpreter who was present when Plaintiff signed it. (Id. at 13-14.) Also present at that time was Plaintiff's workers' compensation attorney. (Id. at 14.) By this time, Plaintiff had already secured a second job with another employer since September 16, 2017. (Id.)
On October 21, 2019, Plaintiff William Cervantes filed the Complaint with six causes of action in San Diego Superior Court. (See Compl.) The Complaint alleged: (1) disability discrimination, in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (2) failure to provide reasonable accommodations, in violation of FEHA; (3) failure to engage in the interactive process, in violation of FEHA; (4) retaliation, in violation of FEHA; (5) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and (6) failure to provide employment records, in violation [*5]  of Labor Code §§ 226(f) & (h) and 1198.5(k) & (l). (Id.) Transdev removed the action to this Court on July 25, 2020. (Doc. No. 1.)

II. LEGAL STANDARD
A court may grant summary judgment when it is demonstrated that there exists no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970). The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing a court of the basis for its motion and of identifying the portions of the declarations, pleadings, and discovery that demonstrate an absence of a genuine dispute of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A fact is "material" if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute is "genuine" as to a material fact if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. See Long v. Cty. of L.A., 442 F.3d 1178, 1185 (9th Cir. 2006).
Where the moving party will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the movant must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the movant. See Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). Where the non-moving party will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the movant may prevail by presenting evidence that negates an essential element of the non-moving party's claim [*6]  or by merely pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support an essential element of the non-moving party's claim. See Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000). If a moving party fails to carry its burden of production, then "the non-moving party has no obligation to produce anything, even if the non-moving party would have the ultimate burden of persuasion." Id. If the moving party meets its initial burden, the burden then shifts to the opposing party to establish that a genuine dispute as to any material fact actually exists. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The opposing party cannot "rest upon the mere allegations or denials of [its] pleading but must instead produce evidence that sets forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." See Estate of Tucker, 515 F.3d 1019, 1030 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
The evidence of the opposing party is to be believed, and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts placed before a court must be drawn in favor of the opposing party. See Stegall v. Citadel Broad, Inc., 350 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir. 2003). However, "[b]ald assertions that genuine issues of material fact exist are insufficient." See Galen v. Cty. of L.A., 477 F.3d 652, 658 (9th Cir. 2007); see also Day v. Sears Holdings Corp., No. 11-09068, 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 2013 WL 1010547, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 13, 2013) ("Conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary [*7]  judgment."). Further, a "motion for summary judgment may not be defeated . . . by evidence that is 'merely colorable' or 'is not significantly probative.'" See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50; see also Hardage v. CBS Broad. Inc., 427 F.3d 1177, 1183 (9th Cir. 2006) (same). If the nonmoving party fails to produce evidence sufficient to create a genuine dispute of material fact, the moving party is entitled to summary judgment. See Nissan Fire & Marine, 210 F.3d at 1103.

III. DISCUSSION
Transdev moves for summary adjudication on the first through fifth of Plaintiff's claims for relief. (Doc. No. 27.) The Court will address each basis for summary adjudication below.

A. Evidentiary Objections
As a preliminary mater, Transdev lodges evidentiary objections to Plaintiff's evidence submitted in support of Plaintiff's opposition to Transdev's motion for summary adjudication. Transdev's relevance objections are unnecessary as the Court cannot rely on irrelevant facts in its summary judgment analysis. See Burch v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1119 (E.D. Cal. 2006). To the extent that the Court relies on this disputed evidence, the Court addresses the evidentiary objections below. As to the remaining objections, to the extent the Court does not rely on the remaining evidence, the Court need not reach those objections.

B. Plaintiff's First Claim for Relief for Disability Discrimination

 [*8] a. Whether Plaintiff's Leave of Absence Was an Adverse Employment Action
Plaintiff's first claim alleges disability discrimination based on Transdev's refusal to allow Plaintiff to return to his position in November 2017 after Plaintiff provided Transdev with an updated medical report, stating he could return to work. This cause of action hinges on whether Plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action because of his disability.
Government Code § 12940(a), the relevant provision, states it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer "to bar or to discharge the person from employment . . . or to discriminate against the person . . . in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment" based on a physical or mental disability or a medical condition. The Legislature has declared that "the statutory definitions of physical and mental disability 'provide protection when an individual is erroneously or mistakenly believed to have any physical or mental condition that limits a major life activity.'" Wallace v. Cty. of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 124, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (2016) (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12926.1(d)) (emphasis in original). Section 12940(a)(2) goes on to state: "This part does not prohibit an employer from . . . discharging an employee who, because of the employee's medical condition, is unable to perform the employee's [*9]  essential duties even with reasonable accommodations. . ." To establish a prima facie case of discrimination on grounds of physical disability under FEHA requires Plaintiff to show: "(1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and, (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability." Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 344-45, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008) (quoting Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 886, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007)) (internal quotations omitted). "[T]he standard for determining whether an employee has been subjected to 'adverse employment action' is whether the employment action materially affected 'terms and conditions of employment,' with that term being liberally construed in order to afford employees 'appropriate and generous protection against employment discrimination.'" Salgado v. Iqvia, Inc., 459 F. Supp. 3d 1318, 1332 (S.D. Cal. 2020) (internal citations omitted).
Since FEHA is an anti-discrimination law modeled after the federal Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), courts analyze FEHA claims under the burden-shifting analysis set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Accordingly, on a motion for summary judgment brought against such a cause of action, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination based upon physical disability, and the burden then shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the [*10]  adverse employment action. See Ellis v. City of Reedley, No. CVF0501474 AWI SMS, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25333, 2007 WL 1098571, at *9 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 12, 2007). Once the employer has done so, the plaintiff must offer evidence that the employer's stated reason is either false or pretextual, or evidence that the employer acted with discriminatory animus, or evidence of each which would permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude the employer intentionally discriminated. Id.
Unchallenged is Plaintiff's assertion that he suffered from a disability and was otherwise qualified to do his job. Plaintiff alleges that although his medical conditions were resolved, Transdev perceived Plaintiff still had a disability and refused to return him to his position as Bus Driver, resulting in an adverse employment action. (Comp. ¶ 26.) Transdev has not asserted a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. (See generally Doc. No. 27.) Transdev, in its decision to keep Plaintiff on unpaid medical leave, relied upon the QME's report from June 2017, despite Plaintiff providing two subsequent reports from his Primary Treating Physician, Dr. Thompson, in September and November of 20171 which released Plaintiff to return to work.2 In its opposition brief, Transdev first asserts there is no triable issue [*11]  as to an adverse employment action because Plaintiff knowingly resigned from his employment. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 13-14.) Plaintiff counters that the adverse employment action occurred not only when he resigned, but also when "Transdev forced him to take unpaid leave." (Doc. No. 29 at 14.) To this point, Plaintiff contends that "[w]hen an employer wrongfully places or maintains an employee on unpaid leave, this is in itself an adverse action entitling the employee to be compensated for lost wages." (Id. at 15) (emphasis added). Title 2 of California Code of Regulations § 11068(c) states, in part, that "[w]hen an employee can work with a reasonable accommodation other than a leave of absence, an employer may not require that the employee take a leave of absence."
Transdev replies that it received conflicting work restrictions issued by two different doctors, Plaintiff never claimed that he could perform the essential job functions of Bus Driver based upon the QME's issued restrictions, nor made requests to return to work based upon the QME's restrictions. (Doc. No. 30 at 8.) In support of its motion, Transdev also states the November 1, 2017 report from Dr. Thompson still contained work restrictions, including "avoid repetitive pushing, [*12]  pulling, and lifting over 30 pounds." (Doc. No. 30 at 9.) Transdev asserts that because of these restrictions and those stated by the QME, it could not place Plaintiff back to work. (Id.) Thus, according to Transdev, Plaintiff's leave of absence is not an adverse employment action. (Id. at 8.)
Plaintiff raises a disputed fact as to whether the unpaid leave of absence here was an adverse employment action. Although Transdev counters that the unpaid leave of absence was not an adverse employment action because Plaintiff allegedly could not perform the essential job functions of Bus Driver, whether Plaintiff could have performed the essential job functions with a reasonable accommodation is a material issue of fact that should not here be resolved in a motion for summary judgment. Neither party contests the essential functions of the job of Bus Driver. However, as discussed below, whether the unpaid leave of absence was an adverse employment action turns on whether such an accommodation was reasonable under the circumstances. Moreover, because California law does not consider an employer's mistaken belief of the disability as a legitimate reason for subjecting the employee to adverse employment [*13]  action, Transdev's reliance on solely the QME report does not absolve it of liability. See Wallace, 245 Cal. App. 4th at 133-34. Because the Plaintiff has presented a prima facie case of disability discrimination as to the third factor regarding an adverse employment action, based upon the unpaid leave of absence, the Court DENIES Transdev's motion for summary adjudication of Plaintiff's first claim.

b. Whether Plaintiff Was Constructively Terminated
Next, the Court turns to Plaintiff's assertion that he was constructively terminated. As stated in Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.:
In order to establish a constructive discharge, an employee must plead and prove . . . that the employer either intentionally created or knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at the time of the employee's resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in the employee's position would be compelled to resign.
7 Cal. 4th 1238, 1256, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994). Additionally, constructive termination requires the adverse working conditions to "be unusually 'aggravated' or amount to a 'continuous pattern' before the situation will be deemed intolerable." Id. at 1247.
Here, Plaintiff has not asserted facts rising to the level of a constructive [*14]  termination. Plaintiff merely states he was placed on unpaid leave of absence and was not permitted to return after providing a report from his primary care physician. He has neither alleged he was unusually aggravated nor that there was a continuous pattern of intolerable working conditions. However, because Plaintiff's unpaid leave of absence is sufficient to establish an adverse employment action, Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim does not fail.

C. Plaintiff's Second Claim for Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Plaintiff next asserts Transdev failed to participate in a timely, good-faith interactive process in violation of Government Code § 12940(n). (Compl. ¶ 34.) Plaintiff alleges Transdev had notice of his need for an accommodations process after the removal of his work restrictions when Plaintiff's counsel demanded they engage in the interactive process. (Id. ¶ 32.) Additionally, Plaintiff states he "was willing to participate in an interactive process to determine whether there were work restrictions, and, if any, whether reasonable accommodation could be made so that he would be able to perform his essential job requirements." (Id. ¶ 33.)
Under FEHA, an employer's failure "to engage [*15]  in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations" is a violation of the statute. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). FEHA imposes on employers a mandatory obligation to engage in the interactive process once an employee requests an accommodation for his or her disability, or when the employer itself recognizes the need for one. Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 246 F.3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001). "Once initiated, the employer has a continuous obligation to engage in the interactive process in good faith." Swanson v. Morongo Unif. Sch. Dist., 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 971, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014). The interactive process "requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identifying an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." Yeager v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 944 F. Supp. 2d 913, 919 (E.D. Cal. 2013). Whether the employer engages in an interactive process is a question of fact. Wilson v. Cty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1193, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009).
To prevail on this claim, Plaintiff must first identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred. Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 379, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015). Plaintiff has identified that he requested to return to work, with or without work restrictions, to be determined by the interactive process. (Compl. ¶ 33.) Whether or not the unpaid leave of absence was a reasonable [*16]  accommodation here is a disputed genuine issue of material fact, as discussed herein. Although Transdev claims the unpaid leave of absence was the reasonable accommodation, "if it did not engage in a good faith interactive process, 'it cannot be known whether an alternative [accommodation] would have been found.'" Wysinger v. Auto. Club of S. Cal., 157 Cal. App. 4th 413, 424-25, 69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2007). Thus, even if it is determined that Transdev reasonably accommodated Plaintiff by providing a leave of absence, "it could still be determined that [Transdev] then 'failed in its continuing duty to engage in the interactive process' following this." Salgado, 459 F. Supp. 3d at 1333 (quoting Perona v. Time Warner Cable, No. EDCV-14-2501-MWF (SPx), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 200311, 2016 WL 8941101, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 6, 2016).
Additionally, if an employer has a perceived conflict or requires clarity regarding medical information, it must seek further medical information to clarify the perceived conflict: "If information provided by the applicant or employee needs clarification, then the employer or other covered entity shall identify the issues that need clarification, specify what further information is needed, and allow the applicant or employee a reasonable time to produce the supplemental information." 2 C.C.R. § 11069(c)(4).
Plaintiff points to several instances where Transdev failed to engage with him. For example, Plaintiff provided Transdev with a note [*17]  from Dr. Thompson on September 27, 2017, to which Transdev responded that it was waiting for the QME to update the present permanent work restrictions. (Doc. No. 29-1 at 119.) Although Transdev responded to Plaintiff's email, it is unclear why Transdev could not accept the note from Dr. Thompson or accommodate Plaintiff's return to work. Again, Plaintiff sent Transdev an updated note from Dr. Thompson on November 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 29-1 at 122.) In response, Transdev informed Plaintiff that his restrictions could not be accommodated, and again referred to the previous QME report without seeming to consider Dr. Thompson's report. (Id.) Plaintiff kept Transdev informed of the extensions of leave and informed Transdev of his intent to return to work. Although Transdev was responsive, it has not met its burden at this point of showing Plaintiff had no evidence of reasonable accommodations available at the time of the interactive process. For example, Transdev has not offered evidence to show it discussed with Plaintiff the return to work he requested or provided an explanation why it could not grant his request as a reasonable accommodation. See Swanson, 232 Cal. App. 4th at 972 (holding the defendant failed to engage [*18]  in the interactive process where it assigned plaintiff to a different position without any explanation why it could not grant her request as a reasonable accommodation.). Moreover, Transdev has not provided a showing that it attempted to resolve the conflict between the QME's report and that of Dr. Thompson.
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES summary adjudication as to Plaintiff's second claim for relief in the Complaint.

D. Plaintiff's Third Claim for Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations Under Government Code § 12940(m)
Plaintiff's third claim against Transdev asserts that although he would have been able to perform his essential job duties with reasonable accommodations, Transdev failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. (Compl. ¶ 40-41.) Transdev responds that Plaintiff's disability was accommodated by providing an extended leave of absence, as well as a temporary work assignment. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 19.) Specifically, Transdev points to the undisputed fact that Plaintiff was absent from work between May 2014 through most of 2016, during which time he participated in a 90-day Early Return to Work Program. (Id.) Thereafter, Plaintiff was again absent all of 2017, until he resigned on April 3, [*19]  2018. (Id.)
"Reasonable accommodation" means a "modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables a disabled employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Lui v. City and Cty. of S.F., 211 Cal. App. 4th 962, 971, 150 Cal. Rptr. 3d 385 (2012). The term is defined in the FEHA regulations only by means of example. Reasonable accommodation
may include either of the following:
(1) Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities.
(2) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p). The reasonableness of an accommodation is generally a question of fact. Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 228 n.11, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). Moreover, the FEHA does not "allow for at least one failure to accommodate, [even] if a pattern of successful accommodation also is shown." A.M. v. Albertsons, LLC, 178 Cal. App. 4th 455, 465, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 449 (2009).
Additionally, California courts deciding cases under FEHA have turned to cases which interpreted the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehabilitation Act") and the ADA because FEHA was modeled after [*20]  both Acts. See Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 948, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997). Under the Rehabilitation Act, courts have held that "the duty on employers . . . 'goes beyond mere nondiscrimination; the regulations promulgated under [the Rehabilitation Act] emphasize the affirmative obligation to accommodate.'" Id. (quoting Buckingham v. U.S., 998 F.2d 735, 739 (9th Cir. 1993)). "An employer, to meet its burden under the [Rehabilitation] Act, may not merely speculate that a suggested accommodation is not feasible. When accommodation is required to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of the job, the employer has a duty to gather sufficient information from the applicant and qualified experts as needed to determine what accommodations are necessary to enable the applicant to perform the job. . ." Id. at 948-49 (internal quotation omitted).
Here, it is undisputed that between May 2014 through November 1, 2017, Transdev gave Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation through both a leave of absence and a temporary Early Return to Work Program. However, the issue here turns to whether Transdev reasonably accommodated Plaintiff after he attempted to reenter the workplace in November 2017. When Plaintiff emailed Dr. Thompson's return-to-work release to Transdev, Transdev informed Plaintiff that it could not reasonably accommodate him due to [*21]  the QME's initial report. Transdev has not provided evidence that it went above mere speculation that the suggested accommodation was not feasible. The fact that Transdev gave Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation between May 2014 and November 2017 also does not insulate it from liability thereafter. Thus, it appears Plaintiff raises material questions relating to whether Transdev was required to return Plaintiff to his position as Bus Driver, or provide him with an alternative position, as part of a reasonable accommodation. An issue of fact also exists as to whether the accommodation sought would have imposed an undue hardship on Transdev. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m).
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Transdev's motion for summary adjudication as to Plaintiff's claim of failure to provide reasonable accommodation.

E. Plaintiff's Fourth Claim for Retaliation in Violation of Government Code § 12940(h)
The FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to "discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). To assert a prima facie claim for retaliation under FEHA, [*22]  Plaintiff must plead that: (1) he engaged in "protected activity," (2) the employer subjected him to an "adverse employment action," and (3) there is a "causal link" between the protected activity and the employer's action. Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005); see also Doe v. Dep't of Corr. & Rehab., 43 Cal. App. 5th 721, 734, 255 Cal. Rptr. 3d 910 (2019); Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir. 2000). In determining FEHA retaliation claims in the context of motions for summary judgment, courts apply the same burden-shifting analysis as for determining discrimination claims under FEHA. See Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042 (citing McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-05).
The "protected activity" Plaintiff claims he engaged in was requesting a reasonable accommodation for his medical disability. (Compl. ¶ 45.) See Moore v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 245, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (discussing that in 2016, the Legislature amended Cal. Gov't Code § 12940 to provide that a reasonable accommodation request is a protected activity). Transdev asserts Plaintiff's retaliation claim must fail because, as discussed in Section B above, Plaintiff was not subjected to an adverse employment action. (Doc. No. 27-1 at 13.) Plaintiff counters that he was constructively terminated when Transdev put him on indefinite unpaid leave without any means to return to work. (Doc. No. 29 at 21; see also Compl. ¶ 47.) In the alternative, Plaintiff states that the "forced unpaid leave is a sufficient adverse employment action" to support [*23]  this claim. (Doc. No. 29 at 14.)
First, the Court turns to Plaintiff's assertion that he was constructively terminated. As discussed herein, Plaintiff has not asserted facts rising to the level of a constructive termination. Plaintiff merely states he was placed on unpaid leave of absence and was not permitted to return after providing a report from his primary care physician. He has neither alleged he was unusually aggravated nor that there was a continuous pattern of intolerable working conditions.
However, the Court has previously determined above that there is a question of fact as to whether the unpaid leave of absence in this case amounts to an adverse employment action. Additionally, Transdev's position is that it in fact gave Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation which did not amount to an adverse employment action. Thus, the Parties neither dispute that Plaintiff engaged in a protected activity nor the causal link between the "protected activity" (here, Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation) and the employer's action (unpaid leave of absence).
Therefore, the Court DENIES Transdev's motion for summary adjudication as to Plaintiff's claim of retaliation.

F. Plaintiff's [*24]  Fifth Claim for Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
"To state a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he was terminated; and (2) his dismissal violated a policy that is fundamental, beneficial for the public, and embodied in a statute or constitutional provision." Jaffe v. Sedgwick Claims Mgmt. Servs., Inc., No. 2:17-cv-03421-ODW (Ex), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116445, 2017 WL 3160561, at *4 (C.D. Cal. July 24, 2017) (citing Turner, 7 Cal. 4th at 1256). Constructive termination may provide the basis for a wrongful termination claim in violation of public policy. Id.
Because the Court found that Plaintiff was not constructively terminated and he voluntarily resigned, as noted herein, Plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination necessarily fails. Thus, the Court GRANTS Transdev's Motion for Summary Adjudication for this cause of action.

IV. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendant Transdev's motion for summary adjudication.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
