Opinion



ORDER
Tonya Okafor ("Ms. Okafor") initiated this lawsuit against her former employer, Infuserve America, Inc. ("Infuserve"), after Infuserve terminated her employment during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ms. Okafor alleges that Infuserve engaged in retaliation and interference under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA") and the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act ("EFMLEA"), discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") and the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 ("FCRA"), and retaliation under the ADA and FCRA. Before the Court is Infuserve's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 26.) Ms. Okafor has responded, and Infuserve has replied. (Doc. 33; Doc. 38.) After careful review of the record viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Ms. Okafor, the Court [*2]  GRANTS Infuserve's Motion for Summary Judgment.

FACTS
Ms. Okafor is in her late forties and has had numerous surgeries within the last decade. (Doc. 27-1 at 3, 7.) In 2015, Ms. Okafor donated one of her kidneys, and, due to complications during the kidney removal surgery, the surgeon also removed her spleen. (Id. at 7-8, 15.) She testified that because her spleen was removed, she was diagnosed as immunocompromised by one of the five or six doctors who participated in the kidney removal surgery. (Id. at 8, 37.) She does not recall if any other doctor diagnosed her as being immunocompromised. (Id. at 9.)
Four years after this surgery, on January 14, 2019, Ms. Okafor began her employment with Infuserve. (Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 3; Doc 27-1 at 10.) Infuserve is a compound pharmacy that makes certain medications onsite in St. Petersburg, Florida. (Doc. 27-1 at 7; Doc. 1-2 at 1). Although Ms. Okafor was initially hired as a paralegal and receptionist, (Doc. 27-1 at 6), shortly after her arrival, Infuserve's Chief Executive Officer, David Kazarian added both compliance and human resources tasks to her duties. (Doc. 27-1 at 6-7; Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 4.) At the time she was hired, Infuserve had approximately [*3]  52 employees. (Doc. 27-1 at 7.)
In addition to her paralegal duties, Ms. Okafor's other duties included responding to visitors to the pharmacy, answering "overflow" calls made to the pharmacy, checking/organizing the mail, paying for and finalizing pharmacy licenses, onboarding new employees, and maintaining employee personnel files. (Doc. 34 at 133.)
From February 1, 2019 until her termination on May 22, 2020, Ms. Okafor reported to Infuserve's Corporate Counsel, Ryan Quigley. (Doc. 27-1 at 6; Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 3.) In June of 2019, while employed with Infuserve, Ms. Okafor underwent surgery to have her gallbladder removed. (Doc. 27-1 at 7-8.) Following gallbladder surgery and a two-week recovery period, she returned to work at Infuserve. (Id. at 8.)
On March 17, 2020, Ms. Okafor learned that Mr. Kazarian had possibly been exposed to COVID-19. (Id. at 11). Later that day, Ms. Okafor went to an urgent care center to be tested for COVID-19, believing that she may have been exposed as well. (Id.) There, she was advised to isolate at home until she received her test results. (Id. at 12.) From March 18th to March 27th, Ms. Okafor worked remotely from her home, and in this temporary remote status, [*4]  Ms. Okafor was able to complete some, but not all, of the essential functions of her job. (Doc. 27-1 at 12; Doc 34 at 134.) Specifically, while working from home, she performed certain paralegal and compliance officer duties, but she was not capable of making payments, picking up Infuserve's mail, serving as receptionist, or answering Infuserve's phones. (Doc. 27-1 at 14, 42-42; Doc. 34 at 134.)
Ms. Okafor returned to work in person on March 30, 2020, after the results of her COVID-19 test came back negative. (Doc 34 at 134.) Upon her return, she told a co-worker, Anthony Wolfinbarger, that she had gotten a splenectomy, and, according to Ms. Okafor, Mr. Wolfinbarger responded that it was "not safe that [Ms. Okafor] be exposed to others since [she] d[oes] not have a properly functioning immune system." (Id.)
Ms. Okafor then spoke to Mr. Quigley and discussed the possibility of working remotely indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Doc. 27-1 at 14; Doc 34 at 134.) Mr. Quigley agreed to the remote work arrangement but asked Ms. Okafor to come in on Tuesdays and Fridays as necessary to handle mail and payments for Infuserve, which she could not complete from home. (Doc. 27-1 at 14 [*5] ; Doc 34 at 134, 135.) Mr. Quigley also asked that Ms. Okafor be at the office on Monday, April 6, 2020 to onboard two new employees, and Ms. Okafor agreed. (Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 7.)
On Friday April 3, 2020,—a day that Mr. Quigley had directed Ms. Okafor to come into the office—Ms. Okafor did not come to work. (Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 8; Doc. 33 at ¶ 5.) Ms. Okafor testified that she was notified on that day that no mail had arrived for her to "organize/review," so she decided to stay home. (Doc. 34 at 135.) Three days later, on Monday, April 6,—the day Ms. Okafor was assigned to onboard two new employees as per her human resources responsibilities—Ms. Okafor came to work but left several hours early. (Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 9; Doc. 33 at ¶ 5.) That afternoon, Mr. Kazarian sent Ms. Okafor an email stating, "I'm disappointed that you just left when there was so much more work to be done. I am also disappoint[ed] that you didn't tell anyone. I'd like to speak to you tomorrow at the office." (Doc. 27-3 at 1.) Ms. Okafor did not respond to this email. (Doc. 27-17 at ¶ 6.) Mr. Quigley then notified Ms. Okafor that she needed to work full-time in the office starting the following day, April 7, because it was [*6]  clear she could not complete her job duties from home. (Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 9.)
But Ms. Okafor did not report to work on April 7 either. (Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 10.) Instead, around noon that day, Ms. Okafor emailed Mr. Quigley that she was "willing to continue working from home." (Doc. 27-4 at 1-3.) She attached to her email a note, dated April 7, from Nurse Practitioner Keyshla Moreno ("Nurse Moreno"), which stated that Ms. Okafor was "advised to self-isolate at home due to immunocompromised status," and that she would "be able to return to work once reviewed by physician." (Id.) Mr. Quigley responded, asking Ms. Okafor when she planned to be reviewed by a physician and offering to schedule an appointment for her with Dr. Adam Brunson, for either April 9 or 10, 2020. (Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 10; Doc. 27-1 at 22; Doc. 27-5 at 1-2.) Ms. Okafor, however, believed that because Dr. Brunson specializes in sports medicine and orthopedics, he was not suited to handling her immune system issues. (Doc. 27-1 at 22.) Mr. Quigley emailed Ms. Okafor again the next day reporting that he had called two other doctors who were family practitioners and they had appointments available. (Doc. 27-1 at 22, 26; Doc. 27-8 at [*7]  2.) The next day, on April 8, Ms. Okafor did not go to the Infuserve office. (Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 11.) Mr. Quigley sent an email to Ms. Okafor asking whether she knew "the date of [her] appointment with a physician to see if [she] c[ould] return to work." (Doc. 27-6 at 1.)
She also did not go into the office on the next day, April 9, prompting Mr. Quigley to email her, inquiring if she had made an appointment with a doctor and directing her to call Mr. Kazarian. (Doc. 27-7 at 2.) Ms. Okafor responded that her next medical appointment was scheduled for May 8, 2020, which was roughly a month away. (Id.) She did not state whether she would be reviewed by a physician, as per Nurse Moreno's April 7, 2020 note suggesting such. (Id.) Mr. Quigley responded asking why Ms. Okafor had not scheduled the appointment sooner. (Id. at 1.) He also informed Ms. Okafor that if she waited until May 8, 2020 to see if she could return to work, she would be placed on administrative leave until she was reviewed by a physician because she could not complete her job duties from home. (Doc. 27-7 at 1; Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 12.) Later that day, Ms. Okafor came to the office to drop off a password book to Mr. Kazarian. (Doc. [*8]  27-1 at 24.) She did not speak with Mr. Kazarian about her job performance, as both Mr. Quigley and Mr. Kazarian had requested, however, and her conversation with Mr. Kazarian lasted only a few seconds. (Doc. 27-1 at 24; Doc. 27-17 at ¶ 7.)
Five days later, on April 14, Ms. Okafor emailed Mr. Quigley stating that she believed she was entitled to accommodations to work from home given her preexisting condition—being immunocompromised as a result of her splenectomy—and cited to the FMLA. (Doc. 27-8 at 5-6; see also Doc 27-1 at 37.) Mr. Quigley responded the next day and stated that: (1) Ms. Okafor had seen an Advanced Registered Practice Nurse, not a doctor; (2) the medical note Ms. Okafor provided did not entitle her to work from home because it required further review by a doctor before working from home was deemed medically necessary; (3) Ms. Okafor chose to delay such review by a doctor by scheduling her appointment for the following month; (4) Ms. Okafor could not work from home because she could not perform the essential functions of her job at home; (5) some of Ms. Okafor's absences and failures to respond to communications were "grounds for termination"; and (5) Ms. Okafor had [*9]  "provided no documentation, explanation or reason as to why [she] c[ould] not see a physician and possibly return to work immediately." (Doc. 27-8 at 1-5.) Mr. Quigley also provided Ms. Okafor with the proper paperwork for her to request medical leave under the FMLA. (Id.)
On May 8, 2020, after a month on paid administrative leave, Ms. Okafor submitted another note from Nurse Moreno stating that Ms. Okafor was advised to self-isolate at home and that she "may benefit from telecommuting." (Doc. 27-9 at 1-2.) Mr. Quigley responded that Infuserve could not accommodate Ms. Okafor's request to work remotely because, once again, Ms. Okafor had not been seen by a physician and had not shown that she could complete the essential functions of her job from home. (Doc. 27-10 at 1-2.) Ms. Okafor responded, asking why Mr. Quigley was "refusing" the medical note she had provided. (Doc. 27-11 at 6.)
On May 13, Mr. Quigley responded, reiterating the same list of Ms. Okafor's shortcomings that he had identified in his April 15 email. (Id. at 1-6.) Mr. Quigley also emphasized further issues with Ms. Okafor's job performance since March 2020 and indicated that Ms. Okafor might be eligible for relief under [*10]  the Family First Coronavirus Response Act. (Id. at 3-6.) Ms. Okafor has introduced no evidence that she responded to this email and testified that she "d[id not] remember if she responded." (Doc. 27-1 at 29.)
On May 22, 2020, Infuserve terminated Ms. Okafor's employment. (Doc. 27-12 at 2.) A few hours later, Ms. Okafor sent another medical note to Mr. Quigley recommending that Ms. Okafor continue to "self-isolate at home due to immunocompromised status." (Doc. 27-13 at 1-2.)
On October 15, 2020, Ms. Okafor filed a Charge of Discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") and the Florida Commission on Human Relations ("FCHR") alleging disability discrimination and retaliation against Infuserve, and on June 15, 2021, the EEOC mailed Ms. Okafor a Notice of Right to Sue. (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 12, 14.) On August 19, 2021, Ms. Okafor filed suit in this Court alleging interference and retaliation under the FMLA and EFMLEA (Count I, II), discrimination and retaliation under the ADA (Count III, V), and discrimination and retaliation under the FCRA (Count IV, VI). (See id. at ¶¶ 84-139.)

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when the movant can show that [*11]  there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "A district court must grant a motion for summary judgment only if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Essex Ins. Co. v. Barrett Moving and Storage, Inc., 885 F.3d 1292, 1299 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)) (quotation marks omitted).
An issue is "genuine" if a reasonable trier of fact, viewing all of the record evidence, could rationally find in favor of the nonmoving party in light of his burden of proof. See Harrison v. Culliver, 746 F.3d 1288, 1298 (11th Cir. 2014.) And a fact is "material" if, "under the applicable substantive law, it might affect the outcome of the case." Hickson Corp. v. N. Crossarm Co., 357 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). "[W]here the material facts are undisputed and do not support a reasonable inference in favor of the non-movant, summary judgment may properly be granted as a matter of law." DA Realty Holdings, LLC v. Tenn. Land Consultants, 631 F. App'x 817, 820 (11th Cir. 2015).
The moving party's burden on a motion for summary judgment "depend[s] on whether the legal issues . . . are ones on which the movant or the non-movant would bear the burden of proof at trial." Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir. 1993). "[F]or issues on which the movant would bear the burden of [*12]  proof at trial, 'that party must show affirmatively the absence of a genuine issue of material fact: it must support its motion with credible evidence . . . that would entitle it to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial.'" Id. (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted). "For issues, however, on which the non-movant would bear the burden of proof at trial, 'the moving party is not required to support its motion with affidavits or other similar material negating the opponent's claim in order to discharge this initial responsibility.'" Id. (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted).

DISCUSSION
Infuserve moves for summary judgment on all of Ms. Okafor's claims. (See Doc. 26 at 10-25.) For the reasons outlined below, the Court agrees with Infuserve and finds that Infuserve is entitled to summary judgment on all claims alleged in Ms. Okafor's Complaint.

I. Infuserve is entitled to summary judgment on Ms. Okafor's FMLA claims because Ms. Okafor has not introduced sufficient evidence that she had a "serious health condition" as provided under the statute.
Ms. Okafor alleges that she was protected by the FMLA and EFMLEA throughout her employment with Infuserve and that under the FMLA [*13]  and EFMLEA, she was protected from interference and retaliation. (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 85-86, 96.) Infuserve argues that the FMLA is inapplicable because Infuserve is not an employer under the FMLA, Ms. Okafor did not qualify for FMLA leave, and Ms. Okafor never sought FMLA leave. (Doc. 26 at 10-12.) Infuserve further argues that Ms. Okafor's EFMLEA claims fail as a matter of law. (Id. at 12.)
The FMLA ensures "[ ]adequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods," among other things. 29 U.S.C. § 2601(a)(4). The term "serious health condition" means "an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves—(A) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or (B) continuing treatment by a health care provider." 29 U.S.C. § 2611(11). Under the FMLA, an eligible employee is "entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following . . . (D) Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). It is unlawful for "any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt [*14]  to exercise" that right to such medical leave. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a).
The Eleventh Circuit has held that section 2615(a) "creates two types of claims: interference claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act, and retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act." Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). "Interference and retaliation claims both require the employee to establish a serious health condition." Russell v. N. Broward Hosp., 346 F.3d 1335, 1340 (11th Cir. 2003) (quotation marks omitted). This is because "[a]n employee must actually qualify for FMLA leave in order to assert an interference or retaliation claim." Hurley v. Kent of Naples, Inc., 746 F.3d 1161, 1166 (11th Cir. 2014). And qualification under the FMLA requires that the petitioner to have a "serious health condition." See 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D).
Here, Ms. Okafor's interference and retaliation claims both fail because she has not introduced sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether she suffered from a serious health condition. It is undisputed that Ms. Okafor had a splenectomy, and that Nurse Moreno diagnosed Ms. Okafor as immunocompromised. It is also undisputed that Nurse Moreno recommended that Ms. Okafor [*15]  work from home due to her immunocompromised status until she saw a physician. But beyond this, Ms. Okafor has not provided evidence that she has a serious health condition that made her "unable to perform the functions of [her] position" such that she would qualify for leave under the FMLA. See 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D).
As previously noted, under the FMLA a "serious health condition" entails "(A) inpatient care . . . or (B) continuing treatment by a healthcare provider." See 29 U.S.C. § 2611(11). Ms. Okafor has made no allegations that she was hospitalized or place into a residential medical care facility as a result of her immunocompromised status. As such, she plainly does not satisfy section 2611(11)(A)'s definition of "serious health condition."
As for section 2611(11)(B), a "serious health condition," requiring "continuing treatment by a health care provider" includes:
[a] period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days . . . that also involves (1) Treatment two or more times, within 30 days of the first day of incapacity . . . by a health care provider, by a nurse under direct supervision of a health care provider . . . or (2) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion, which results in a regimen of continuing treatment [*16]  under the supervision of the health care provider.
29 C.F.R. § 825.115(a).
Alternatively, the period of incapacity could involve a chronic condition—defined as "[a]ny period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition," which:
(1) Requires periodic visits (defined as at least twice a year) for treatment by a health care provider, by a nurse under direct supervision of a health care provider . . . (2) Continues over an extended period of time . . .; and (3) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity.
29 C.F.R. § 825.115(c). Under the FMLA, "incapacity" means the inability to work or perform other daily activities due to a serious health condition. 29 C.F.R. § 825.113(b). Ms. Okafor has not presented evidence that she has a "serious medical condition" because she has pointed to no period during which she was incapacitated and received subsequent treatment relating to the condition which incapacitated her. First, Ms. Okafor has introduced no evidence that she actually contracted COVID-19 during the relevant period. And although she states she was at high risk of serious illness that could have brought about a period of incapacity, the evidence does not reflect that such a period of medical [*17]  incapacity ever occurred.
Second, none of Ms. Okafor's periods of self-isolation can be considered periods of incapacity because, by her own admission, Ms. Okafor was able to work quite productively from home such that "[a]ll [her] job was done except for the phones." (See Doc. 27-1 at 25.) As Ms. Okafor testified, "The only reason I could not perform my job duties 100 percent from home is because the company prevented me from being able to." (Id. at 32.) Even after Ms. Okafor was given permission to self-isolate at home, she came to the office on at least two occasions and, among other things, conducted an in-person onboarding training for new employees. (Id. at 18-19.) In sum, per her own testimony, at no point did Ms. Okafor's immunocompromised status render her unable to fully complete her job duties. (See id. at 32, 38.)
Third, even if Ms. Okafor's exposure to COVID-19 in March 2020 could be considered a period of incapacity, Ms. Okafor has neither presented evidence that she was treated two or more times by Nurse Moreno within 30 days after that period, nor do any of Nurse Moreno's notes indicate "a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the healthcare provider" [*18]  as required under the FMLA. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.115.
Continuing to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Ms. Okafor, as the Court has done thus far, the Court notes that Ms. Okafor was exposed to COVID-19 on March 17, 2020, and she saw Nurse Moreno on April 7, 2020 and 31 days later on May 8, 2020. She then saw Nurse Moreno on May 22, 2020. Thus, she sought medical treatment three times during a 45-day period. (See Doc. 27-4 at 3; Doc. 27-9 at 2; Doc. 27-13 at 2; see also Doc. 27-15 at 7.) Furthermore, Nurse Moreno's notes after these visits recommended Ms. Okafor to "self-isolate at home" and noted that Ms. Okafor "will be able to return to work once reviewed by [a] physician." (Doc. 27-4 at 3; Doc. 27-9 at 2; Doc. 27-13 at 2.) This is simply not a "regimen of continuing treatment" administered by a health care provider as is required to prove incapacity under the FMLA. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.115.
Finally, Ms. Okafor has not shown that she had a chronic condition, which meets the requirements of 29 C.F.R. § 825.115(c). Again, Ms. Okafor has neither pointed to a period of incapacity nor has she demonstrated that she has been visiting a health care provider for "an extended period of time" as is required by the FMLA. See id.
Accordingly, [*19]  while the Court sympathizes with the concern that Ms. Okafor had about her health during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, without proof of incapacity, such concern does not constitute a serious medical condition under the FMLA See Barker v. R.T.G. Furniture Corp., 375 F. App'x 966, 968 (11th Cir. 2010) (finding no evidence of a "serious medical condition" where plaintiff's diagnosed anxiety only "caused him to take short breaks from his work" but did not evince any significant incapacity); Lee v. U.S. Steel Corp., 450 F. App'x 834, 837-38 (11th Cir. 2012) (holding that the plaintiff "presented no evidence to show that his alleged back injury was a serious medical condition that rendered him eligible for FMLA-qualifying leave," as the medical certifications provided by the plaintiff failed to show that the back condition incapacitated him for periods of three days or more). Without a serious health condition qualifying her for FMLA leave, Ms. Okafor would not have been entitled to FMLA leave on March 17, 2020. Because both interference and retaliation claims require the employee to qualify for FMLA leave in the first instance, summary judgment is warranted on Ms. Okafor's FMLA claims. See Hurley, 746 F.3d at 1166-67.

II. Infuserve is entitled to summary judgment on Ms. Okafor's EFMLEA claims because Ms. Okafor has introduced no evidence [*20]  that she needed to work remotely in order to care for a child under the age of eighteen.
Infuserve also argues that Ms. Okafor has not introduced any evidence that she would qualify for protection under the EFMLEA. (Doc. 26 at 12.) The Court agrees. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act ("FFCRA"), which contains the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act, among other Acts, was enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide paid leave and benefits to employees for various reasons related to COVID-19. See Paid Leave Under the FFCRA, 85 Fed. Reg. 19326-01, 19327 (Apr. 6, 2020); see also 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(F).
Through the EFMLEA, the FFCRA temporarily amended the FMLA to provide up to twelve weeks of family and medical leave, ten of which were paid, for covered employees who had a "qualifying need related to a public health emergency." FFCRA, Pub. L. No. 116-127, §§ 3101-06, 134 Stat. 178 (2020) (codified at 29 U.S.C. § 2612). The EFMLEA incorporated the provisions of the FMLA prohibiting an employer's interference with or retaliation against employees taking EFMLEA leave. See 29 C.F.R. § 826.151(a) (2020). The EFMLEA entitles an "employee" to paid leave where she is unable to work due to a need to care for her child whose childcare provider is unavailable for reasons related to a public health emergency. See 29 U.S.C. § 2620(a)(2)(A).
The elements of proof for a claim under the EFMLEA [*21]  are analyzed using the traditional FMLA rubric. See Martinez v. Aspen Dental Mgmt. Inc., No. 2:20-cv-545-JES-MRM, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30911, 2022 WL 523559, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 22, 2022). Specifically, a plaintiff must show that she was entitled to a benefit under the EFMLEA, and her employer denied her that benefit. 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30911, [WL] at *11 (quotation omitted). For an employee to show entitlement to such a benefit, she "must demonstrate that she sought leave for a qualifying reason and that she provided notice meeting certain criteria." Ramji v. Hosp. Housekeeping Sys., LLC, 992 F.3d 1233, 1242 (11th Cir. 2021). Under the statute,
The term "qualifying need related to a public health emergency", with respect to leave, means the employee is unable to work (or telework) due to a need for leave to care for the son or daughter under 18 years of age of such employee if the school or place of care has been closed, or the child care provider of such son or daughter is unavailable, due to a public health emergency.
29 U.S.C. § 2620(a)(2)(A).
Ms. Okafor has introduced no evidence to support her allegation that she is entitled to benefits under the EFMLEA. Ms. Okafor testified that she did not have a child under eighteen years of age in 2020. (Doc. 27-1 at 5-6.) Furthermore, Ms. Okafor did not seek leave from Infuserve to care for a child, or anyone else, in 2020. (Id. at 21.) In sum, Ms. Okafor has not set forth any evidence that she was entitled [*22]  to leave provided under the EFMLEA. Without evidence indicating that Ms. Okafor was a qualified individual under the EFMLEA in 2020, summary judgment is due to be granted for Infuserve as to Ms. Okafor's EFMLEA claims.

III. Infuserve is entitled to summary judgment on Ms. Okafor's disability discrimination claims brought under the ADA and FCRA.
Infuserve next moves for summary judgment on Ms. Okafor's disability discrimination claims, arguing that Ms. Okafor's immunocompromised status is not a disability, and Ms. Okafor cannot establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate or disparate treatment under the ADA or the FCRA. (Doc. 26 at 13-19.) Ms. Okafor responds that her lack of a spleen—and the immunodeficiencies caused by the absence of this organ—constitutes a disability under both statutes. (Doc. 33 at 9-19.) She further argues that she was discriminated against when Infuserve failed to provide her with reasonable accommodations on the basis of her disability, and she was terminated from Infuserve on the basis of her disability. (Id.) For the reasons below, the Court agrees with Infuserve that summary judgment on these claims is due to be granted as well.
Disability-discrimination [*23]  claims under the FCRA are analyzed under the same framework as ADA claims, and district courts are encouraged to consider the two sets of claims together. See D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1224 n.2 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2007) (explaining that the FCRA is simply the "Florida analog" of the ADA). The Court will therefore consider Ms. Okafor's disability discrimination claims brought under the ADA and the FCRA simultaneously. For ease of reading, the Court will only reference the ADA, but both statutes are contemplated in the analysis.
In order to establish a prima facie claim of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she "(1) is disabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of [her] disability." Waddell v. Valley Forge Dental Assocs. Inc., 276 F.3d 1275, 1279 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). In addition, a plaintiff must also establish that her employer had actual knowledge of her alleged disability or regarded her as disabled. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2005).

A. Does Plaintiff have a disability?
Under the ADA, a "disability" is "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). Major life activities include, but are not limited to "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, [*24]  sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). They also include the "operation of a major bodily function" such as "functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B) (emphasis added).
Ms. Okafor has introduced evidence that she had a splenectomy, and as a result of this splenectomy, she is immunocompromised. (Doc. 27-1 at 31.) For example, Nurse Moreno testified that "[t]he absence of a spleen automatically makes a patient at risk for severe and overwhelming infection." (See Doc. 27-15 at 8.) Further, Ms. Okafor has testified that the doctor that performed her splenectomy diagnosed her as being immunocompromised. (Doc. 27-1 at 37.) Ms. Okafor has therefore introduced evidence that her physical impairment—namely, her lack of a spleen—substantially limits the functions of her immune system. Because "functions of the immune system" are included in the ADA's definition of the "operation of a major bodily function"—and, by extension, major life activities—the Court finds that there [*25]  is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Ms. Okafor has a disability under the ADA.

B. Is Plaintiff a qualified individual?
The second element of the prima facie case requires the plaintiff to establish that she is a "qualified individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA defines the term "qualified individual" as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987).
The Eleventh Circuit follows a two-step approach in determining whether a disabled person is otherwise qualified. See Reed v. Heil Co., 206 F.3d 1055, 1062 (11th Cir. 2000). First, the Court determines whether the person has the requisite qualifications for the positions, such as sufficient experience and skills, education, and any appropriate licenses. Id. Second, the Court assesses whether [*26]  the person can perform the essential functions of the job in question, either with or without a reasonable accommodation. Id.
Here, Infuserve does not argue that Ms. Okafor did not have the requisite qualifications for the position. It simply argues that she could not perform the essential functions of the position. (See Doc. 26 at 15-16.) Specifically, Infuserve argues that "Okafor's accommodation request to work from home on a full-time basis was not reasonable because she could not complete the essential functions of her position while working from home." (Id. at 16.)
Essential functions are the fundamental job duties of the position and do not include marginal functions. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); see also Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2001). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes: (1) the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential; (2) written job descriptions that were prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job; (3) the amount of time spent performing the particular function; and (4) the consequences of not requiring the jobholder to perform the function. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3). Three factors make it more likely that a specific duty is an essential function of the job:
(1) the reason [*27]  the position exists is to perform the function; (2) there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of the job function can be distributed; and (3) the function is highly specialized so that the [person holding] the position was hired for his or her ability to perform the particular function.
See Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i)-(iii) (1996)).
To establish a valid ADA claim, an employee must show that she is able to meet all of the requirements of a job, despite any disability. See Se. Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406 (1979). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1229 (citation and quotation marks omitted). If a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of her job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then she is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA. See Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).
Here, it is undisputed that Ms. Okafor was able to perform the essential functions of her job while she was physically present and working in the office. Instead, Infuserve argues that Ms. Okafor cannot show she was [*28]  a qualified individual because the evidence demonstrates that she was not able to perform the essential functions of her job while working from home. (Doc. 26 at 16.) Both Infuserve and Ms. Okafor agree that Ms. Okafor had four essential job functions: (1) receptionist, (2) paralegal, (3) compliance, and (4) HR. Infuserve has introduced evidence that the essential functions of these four roles required that Ms. Okafor be in the workplace in person. (See Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 5; Doc. 27-17 at ¶ 3.) For example, Mr. Quigley stated under oath that:
Ms. Okafor's receptionist duties required she cover the front desk, respond to visitors, review mail and answer phones. Ms. Okafor's paralegal duties required her to handle sensitive and private patient files which could not leave the facility. Ms. Okafor's HR duties required her to onboard new employees and perform other HR functions at the office. Ms. Okafor's compliance duties required she be present at the office so she could pay for and finalize pharmacy licenses.
Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 5.
And Ms. Okafor concedes that while she was working from home, she was not performing some of these essential duties. For example, Ms. Okafor was not handling overflow [*29]  phone calls or picking up office mail while she was working from home, as was required by her receptionist role. (See Doc. 27-1 at 12, 14.) She was also not making payments as was required by her compliance duties, and she was not in the office long enough to onboard new employees as was required by her HR responsibilities. (See id. at 14, 32.)
Nevertheless, Ms. Okafor argues that "[d]espite [her] immunocompromised status, with reasonable accommodation, [she] was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job safely." (Doc. 33 at 11.) Ms. Okafor has testified that she could complete all of the essential functions of her receptionist, paralegal, HR, and compliance roles from home if she was provided with reasonable accommodations. Specifically, she alleges that she could have had calls forwarded to her personal cellphone, and she could have been approved to make credit card payments from home. (Doc. 34 at 20, 30-31.) And while Ms. Okafor has not introduced any evidence about her ability to complete the other duties requiring her in-person presence at work—such as responding to visitors, reviewing postal mail, handling sensitive and private patient files that could not leave [*30]  the facility, and onboarding new employees—the record is clear that Ms. Okafor was comfortable coming into the office on occasion in order to handle some of these discrete duties requiring her to be physically present. (See id. at 17, 21-22.)
Noting that the Court may not weigh evidence at the summary judgment stage, the Court finds that Ms. Okafor has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she could perform the essential functions of her position from home if she was provided with reasonable accommodation.

C. Did Infuserve fail to provide a reasonable accommodation?
The third and final element of Ms. Okafor's prima facie case requires her to present sufficient evidence to establish that she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resols. Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). The ADA states clearly that an employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer does not make "reasonable accommodations" for the employee, unless "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment [*31]  to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). An employer is not required, however, to provide an employee with "the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted).
While the ADA lists several types of possible accommodations, the fact that a particular accommodation may be included does not mean that such accommodation is per se reasonable under the statute. See Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626 (11th Cir. 1998). The accommodation must also be reasonable based on the specific facts and circumstances under the case. Id. "An accommodation can qualify as 'reasonable,' and thus be required by the ADA, only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1259-60. "In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 (quotation omitted).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that [*32]  employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000). Thus, it is the plaintiff who "bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the employee desires." Gilliard v. Ga. Dep't of Corr., 500 F. App'x 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).
The Eleventh Circuit, in the context of the Rehabilitation Act, has recently clarified how an employee can identify her disability in order to trigger her employer's duty to accommodate her disability. See Owens v. State of Ga., Governor's Off. of Student Achievement, 52 F.4th 1327 (11th Cir. Nov. 9, 2022). There are two steps to identify such a disability. First, "an employee must provide at least some information about how a physical or mental condition limits her functioning." Id. at 1335. Next, "an employee must provide her employer enough information to assess how her proposed accommodation would help her overcome her disability's limitations." Id. Specifically, "an employee must link her disability to her requested accommodation by explaining how the requested accommodation could alleviate the workplace challenges posed by her specific disability." Id. Where the link between the employee's disability and the accommodation [*33]  is not obvious, additional information may be required in order for an employee to inform her employer how the accommodation she seeks will address her limitations before requiring the employer to initiate the interactive process. Id. at 1335-36. "The bottom line is that employees must give employers enough information to respond effectively to an accommodation request." Id. at 1335.
Most critically, an employer's "duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999). Thus, when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quotation omitted). Ultimately, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has a duty to engage in an "interactive process" with the employee to identify her limitations or before the employer has a duty to establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id. at 1367; see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3).
Here, as is explained below, Ms. Okafor has failed to demonstrate that she made specific demands for a reasonable accommodation, that the accommodation [*34]  she requested was "reasonable" under the circumstances, or that Infuserve failed to accommodate her request for accommodation.

i. Ms. Okafor has failed to demonstrate that she made specific demands for a reasonable accommodation.
Ms. Okafor worked from home for roughly a week following her initial test for COVID-19 on March 17, 2020. (Doc. 27-1 at 11-12.) By her own testimony, Ms. Okafor never suggested that she work from home. In fact, discussions about Ms. Okafor working from home only began after Ms. Okafor returned to work on March 30, 2020, and another employee told her that she should work from home. (Id. at 14.) This employee encouraged Ms. Okafor to speak with Mr. Quigley, and when she did so, Mr. Quigley and Ms. Okafor decided that Ms. Okafor did not have to be in the office five days a week. (Id.) The two agreed, per Mr. Quigley's suggestion, that Ms. Okafor would come into the office on Tuesdays and Fridays to "deal with the mail." (Id.) Not only did Ms. Okafor not initially suggest that she work from home when she returned to work on March 30, 2020, but she also testified that she did not want to work from home. As the transcript from Ms. Okafor's deposition makes clear:
 [*35] Q. Okay. And did you want to work from home?
A. Honestly, no.
Q. You did not want to work from home?
A. I mean, you know, I liked going into the office every day, but the thing is if it was for my health, then, yes, I'm going to do what I have to do to protect myself. So, you know, for my health reasons, yes, I mean, I was willing to work from home.
(Id.) Ms. Okafor then worked from home for a week until she received an email on April 6, 2020 instructing her to return to the office the next day, the implication being that Ms. Okafor's trial run working remotely was over. (See Doc. 27-2 at 1.) Ms. Okafor scheduled an appointment with Nurse Moreno for April 7, 2020, seeking, among other things, a medical note stating that she needed to work from home. (See Doc. 27-1 at 15 (quoting Nurse Moreno's report as stating "patient presents to establish care and work note")).
After being seen by Nurse Moreno on April 7, 2020, however, Ms. Okafor again neglected to make specific demands for a reasonable accommodation. Instead, she emailed Mr. Quigley stating, "Please see attached note from the doctor. I am willing to continue working from home just like I have been." (Doc. 27-4 at 2.) Nurse Moreno's [*36]  note stated "Patient was advised to self-isolate at home due to immunocompromised status[.] Patient will be able to return to work once reviewed by physician." (Id. at 3.) Ms. Okafor did not schedule a follow-up appointment for another month despite Infuserve's request that she be evaluated sooner. (Doc. 27-5 at 2; Doc. 27-2 at 2.) And when she did schedule that appointment for May 8, 2020, she was not seen by a physician, but instead by Nurse Moreno, who once again stated, "Patient was advised to self-isolate at home due to immunocompromised status. According to patient's job duties it is my opinion patient may benefit from telecommuting." (Doc. 27-9 at 2.) Ms. Okafor attached this note to an email to Mr. Quigley on May 8, 2020, where she stated, "Please see the note attached below" and included information regarding her follow-up appointment. (Id. at 1.)
Although Nurse Moreno's recommendation that Ms. Okafor work remotely "qualifies as a demand for specific accommodation, it does not explain how that accommodation would alleviate any physical or mental limitation." See Owens, 52 F.4th at 1337 (holding that the plaintiff's provision of a doctor's note to her employer requesting to work from home was insufficient [*37]  to trigger an employer's duty to provide reasonable accommodations). "Vague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations under the ADA." Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 448 (11th Cir. 1996). It is difficult to see how a nurse's note asserting that Ms. Okafor should work remotely until she was evaluated by a physician, or a note scheduling a follow-up appointment would give Infuserve any information about how an indefinite period of telework would accommodate her disability. Thus, Ms. Okafor has not demonstrated that she made a sufficiently specific demand for a reasonable accommodation, which would trigger Infuserve's duty to provide such an accommodation. See Gaston, 167 F.3d at 1363 (explaining that even if an employee is legally disabled, she must specifically request an accommodation to trigger the employer's accommodation obligations) (emphasis added).

ii. Ms. Okafor has failed to introduce sufficient evidence that indefinite remote work was a reasonable accommodation.
Even if Ms. Okafor's emails attaching Nurse Moreno's note recommending that Ms. Okafor work remotely did count as a specific demand for reasonable accommodation, Ms. Okafor has failed to demonstrate that indefinite [*38]  remote work was in fact a reasonable accommodation. First, the Eleventh Circuit case law is clear that an indefinite pause on some aspect of a plaintiff's job as a result of a disability-related accommodation is unreasonable. See Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-57 (11th Cir. 2016) (affirming district court's decision that the plaintiff's request for "an indefinite extension of her light-duty status . . . was unreasonable as a matter of law").
As discussed above, it is uncontested that Ms. Okafor could not perform all essential functions of her job from home. And while Ms. Okafor now specifies two ways she could have handled her phone and payment duties remotely, she has introduced scant evidence that she made such suggestions to Infuserve at any time between March 2020 and May 2020. She merely notes that in a phone call with Mr. Quigley where Mr. Quigley asked her to come back to the office permanently if she could not produce a doctor's note, she told Mr. Quigley she "can answer phones from [her] cell phone if they would send them to [her] phone." (Doc. 34 at 20.) This is not an adequate request for a reasonable accommodation because it addressed only one of Ms. Okafor's many job capacities, leaving many of her strictly in-person tasks [*39]  unattended to. (See Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 5.) Furthermore, at least as is reflected in Ms. Okafor's testimony, there is no indication that this accommodation was logistically feasible or in compliance with Infuserve's responsibilities with respect to maintaining the security and confidentiality of those telephoning the pharmacy. See Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding "where a plaintiff cannot demonstrate 'reasonable accommodation,' the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant").
Additionally, nothing in this request indicated that Ms. Okafor could not perform her job of receptionist without reasonable accommodation at the time she mentioned the potential for such an accommodation. See Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222, 1225 (11th Cir. 1997) (explaining that the portions of the ADA related to requests for accommodation "are formulated entirely in the present tense, framing the precise issue as to whether an individual 'can' (not 'will be able to') perform the job with reasonable accommodations"). Ms. Okafor at this point was still refusing to be seen by a doctor, so the extent of her immunological vulnerability in the workplace remained largely unknown. (Doc. 27-1 at 26.) By requesting that she be allowed indefinitely to answer calls [*40]  to Infuserve on her personal cellphone, Ms. Okafor's suggestion does not constitute a reasonable request for accommodation given the unclear state of her health. See Duckett, 120 F.3d at 1226 (holding that "[p]laintiff's request that his employer accommodate any disability Plaintiff had by providing him with two more months leave when he could not show he would likely be then able to labor is not 'reasonable' within the meaning of the ADA: the course of [p]laintiff's health was too uncertain"); Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003) (holding that where plaintiff "was requesting an accommodation of indefinite leaves of absence so that he could work at some uncertain point in the future" plaintiff's requested accommodation was not reasonable because "the ADA covers people who can perform the essential functions of their jobs presently or in the immediate future.")
Ms. Okafor has also failed to introduce any evidence that other basic functions of her compliance, HR, and receptionist duties—such as greeting visitors, onboarding new employees, and handling confidential files—could be handled remotely. Instead, she argues that these are not essential functions of her job. (See Doc. 33 at 12, 16.) But as the case law makes clear, it is up to the employer, [*41]  not the employee, to determine the essential functions of a position. And an accommodation request is unreasonable as a matter of law where it requires an employer to eliminate an essential job function. See Bucklew v. Charter Commc'ns, Inc, No. 8:19-CV-2029-TPB-AAS, 2021 WL 1255625, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 5, 2021) ("An accommodation is only reasonable when it allows the employee to perform his or her essential job functions. Plaintiff's requested accommodation amounts to a request that he be allowed to periodically cease performing his essential job functions"); see also Leme v. So. Baptist Hosp. of Fla., Inc., 248 F. Supp. 3d 1319, 1345-46 (S.D. Fla. 2017) (holding that the requested accommodation which would eliminate certain duties rather than enabling plaintiff to perform them was per se unreasonable).
Most concerning of all, though, Ms. Okafor has not introduced any evidence explaining why she repeatedly refused to see a physician, and, in lieu of seeing a physician, chose to schedule a follow-up appointment with Nurse Moreno thirty-one days after her initial appointment. It is uncontested that the note provided by Nurse Moreno stated, "Patient will be able to return to work once reviewed by physician" and that Nurse Moreno was not a physician at the time she saw Ms. Okafor on April 7, 2020. (Doc. 27-4 at 3.) When provided with this note on April 7, 2020, Mr. Quigley [*42]  responded asking Ms. Okafor when she would be seen by a doctor. (Doc. 27-5 at 1-2.) But instead of scheduling an appointment with a doctor so that the extent of her immunocompromised status could be assessed promptly, Ms. Okafor scheduled another appointment with Nurse Moreno for roughly one month after her initial appointment. (See Doc. 27-7 at 1-3.)
Furthermore, this follow-up appointment with Nurse Moreno had nothing to do with Ms. Okafor's immunocompromised status. Instead, Nurse Moreno's notes reflect that her May 8, 2020 appointment with Ms. Okafor was for "[r]eproductive system services." (Doc. 34 at 122.) Accordingly, by waiting more than thirty days for a follow-up appointment, failing to be seen by a physician—as Nurse Moreno's initial note had instructed—and focusing on her reproductive health rather than on her immune system in this follow-up appointment, Ms. Okafor effectively precluded any working arrangement that would allow her to complete all functions of her job. Ms. Okafor's conduct with respect to her vaguely defined proposed accommodation therefore presented Infuserve with the unenviable choice of either repeatedly reminding an employee to see a doctor or allowing [*43]  that employee to complete only part of her job remotely.
Thus, to the extent that the accommodation Ms. Okafor proposed included her working remotely indefinitely and foregoing certain functions of her job which indisputably required her to be in person—greeting visitors and onboarding new employees—Ms. Okafor has not met her burden of identifying an accommodation and demonstrating that the accommodation she proposed was reasonable. See Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1255; see also Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 ("[T]he ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job.").

iii. Infuserve did make accommodations for Ms. Okafor.
Finally, the evidence introduced indicates that Infuserve did, in fact, make accommodations for Ms. Okafor. For example, Mr. Wolfinbarger recommended that Ms. Okafor work from home before she ever formally asked to work from home; Mr. Quigley met with Ms. Okafor to discuss her medical concerns, and he allowed her to work remotely so long as she came into the office to pick up mail and make payments via the company credit card; and Mr. Quigley responded to Nurse Moreno's note by offering to schedule an appointment for Ms. Okafor with a physician. (Doc. 27-1 at 14-15; Doc. 27-5 at 1-2; [*44]  Doc. 27-8 at 2.) In sum, there is simply no evidence that Infuserve refused to provide any accommodations for Ms. Okafor.
Ultimately, Ms. Okafor has not offered sufficient evidence that she "made a specific request for a reasonable accommodation[,]" and that her "employer . . . failed to provide a reasonable accommodation, or engage in the requisite interactive process in order to identify a reasonable accommodation," as is required under the ADA. See D'Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 964 F.3d 1014, 1021 (11th Cir. 2020). Thus, because there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Infuserve reasonably accommodated Ms. Okafor's disability, Infuserve is entitled to summary judgment on Ms. Okafor's failure to accommodate disability discrimination claims under the ADA and FCRA.

IV. Ms. Okafor cannot establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment discrimination under the ADA or the FCRA.
Next, Infuserve argues that Ms. Okafor's disparate treatment claims under the ADA fail as a matter of law because Ms. Okafor is not a qualified individual with a disability, and she cannot establish that her termination would not have occurred but for her alleged disability. (Doc. 26 at 18.) Ms. Okafor responds that Infuserve's emphasis on the "but for" analysis is [*45]  improper. (Doc. 33 at 18.) Instead, Ms. Okafor argues, the Court should look to the fact that "in lieu of providing reasonable accommodation," Infuserve terminated Ms. Okafor, and therefore, her termination was because of her disability. (Id. at 18-19.) For the reasons below, the Court agrees with Infuserve and finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Ms. Okafor was discriminated against on the basis of her disability.
In the Eleventh Circuit, the burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) for Title VII disparate treatment claims applies to disparate treatment claims brought under the ADA. See, e.g., Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004). Under this framework, a plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment. A plaintiff succeeds at this step by showing that (1) she had a disability; (2) she was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job with or without a disability; and (3) she was subjected to an adverse employment action because of her disability. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1255-56. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Wascura v. City of S. Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001).
Once the defendant carries its minimal [*46]  burden, the plaintiff must raise a genuine issue that the defendant's "proffered reason really is a pretext for unlawful discrimination" to survive a motion for summary judgment. Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., 520 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted). The plaintiff can show a genuine dispute of material fact as to pretext by showing "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Devs., Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1265 (11th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). To show pretext, the plaintiff can rely on circumstantial evidence so long as the evidence "raises a reasonable inference that the employer discriminated against the plaintiff." Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011). Circumstantial evidence of pretext "may include . . . the same evidence offered initially to establish the prima facie case." Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1088 (11th Cir. 2004), abrogated on other grounds by Lewis v. City of Union City, 918 F.3d 1213, 1218 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc) (citation omitted).
As discussed in the preceding section, Ms. Okafor has introduced adequate evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether she has a disability and was otherwise qualified for the position. What remains is the question of whether Ms. Okafor suffered an adverse employment action because of her [*47]  disability.
Plaintiffs endeavoring to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to this third element tend to point to similarly situated employees without a disability who were treated more favorably. See Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1091 ("The plaintiff and the employee she identifies as a comparator must be similarly situated in all relevant respects. The comparator must be nearly identical to the plaintiff to prevent courts from second-guessing a reasonable decision by the employer.") (citation omitted).
Here, Ms. Okafor points to two employees who were allowed to work from home—Luz and Evelyn—who were not receptionists, paralegals, compliance officers, or human resources personnel, but who instead worked in quality control and IT, respectively. (Doc. 27-1 at 12.) Ms. Okafor could not identify the job responsibilities of either individual, nor could she identify whether either individual was able to successfully complete such responsibilities working remotely. (See id. at 12-13.) Ms. Okafor was therefore unable to show that either Luz or Evelyn or any other employee was similarly situated "in all material respects" as is required to establish a prima facie claim of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas. See [*48]  Lewis, 918 F.3d at 1224. Ms. Okafor has identified no other receptionist, paralegal, compliance officer, or HR personnel who was not disabled and who was permitted to work from home. Accordingly, Ms. Okafor has failed to introduce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether similarly situated employees without a disability were treated more favorably than her. And where a plaintiff fails to show the existence of a preferentially treated and similarly situated employee, summary judgment is appropriate when no other evidence of discrimination is present.
Even if Ms. Okafor was able to establish a prima facie case, Infuserve contends that it had legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Ms. Okafor, and that Ms. Okafor cannot rebut Infuserve's reasons. (Doc. 26 at 21-25.) Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, "the defendant-employer must articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged action . . . [T]he defendant's evidence [must] raise[ ] a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff." Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1242-43 .
Here, Infuserve argues that Ms. Okafor engaged in "a pattern of blatant insubordination towards [*49]  Infuserve's CEO and her direct supervisor." (Doc. 26 at 21.) Before Ms. Okafor's termination, she failed to return emails (including emails from the CEO of Infuserve), she did not come to the office when she was asked to, she left the office early when she was tasked with training new hires, she failed to provide payment information to another Infuserve employee, she failed to pay license fees for pending applications, and she did not include important documents in applications that she was preparing, among other things. (See Doc. 27-11 at 4-5.) Ms. Okafor has not introduced any evidence to refute these claims.
First, Ms. Okafor has not established a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination. Next, even if Ms. Okafor indeed established a prima facie case, Infuserve has introduced evidence supporting the fact that it had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons to terminate Ms. Okafor. And Ms. Okafor has failed to present any evidence to rebut these legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment to Infuserve on Ms. Okafor's ADA and FCRA disparate treatment discrimination claims.

V. Infuserve is entitled to summary judgment on Ms. Okafor's [*50]  retaliation claims under the ADA and the FCRA.
Last, Infuserve moves for summary judgment on Ms. Okafor's ADA and FCRA retaliation claims arguing that she has failed to show that her disability was the but-for cause of her termination. (Doc. 26 at 19-21.)
The ADA prohibits retaliation against an individual because the individual has opposed conduct "made unlawful by [the ADA]" or because the individual "made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [the ADA]." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). The FCRA is nearly identical to its federal counterpart, providing that:
It is an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any person because that person has opposed any practice which is an unlawful employment practice under this section, or because that person has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this section.
Fla. Stat. § 760.10(7). Because of the similarity between the FCRA's and the ADA's retaliation provisions, Florida courts recognize federal case law when examining FCRA retaliation claims. See Hinton v. Supervision Int'l, Inc., 942 So. 2d 986, 989 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006). The retaliation provisions under both the FCRA and the ADA "specifically [*51]  protect two types of activity: opposition and participation." Id. at 989-90.
In the Eleventh Circuit, ADA retaliation claims are assessed "under the same framework [courts] employ for retaliation claims under Title VII." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997) (applying the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802-03). To avoid summary judgment, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case for retaliation under the ADA. Richardson v. Leeds Police Dep't, 71 F.3d 801, 805 (11th Cir. 1995). "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she engaged in a statutorily protected expression; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the adverse action and her protected expression." Parker v. Econ. Opportunity for Savannah-Chatham Cnty. Area, Inc., 587 F. App'x 631, 633 (11th Cir. 2014). Once the employee has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1297. If the employer does so, the burden shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the "employer's proffered reason was pretextual by presenting evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision." Martin v. Brevard Cnty. Pub. Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2008) (citation and quotation marks omitted).
Statutorily protected expression under [*52]  the ADA includes requests for reasonable accommodations. See Meyer v. Sec'y, U.S. Dep't of Health & Hum. Servs., 592 F. App'x 786, 792 (11th Cir. 2014) (holding that plaintiff met the first requirement of the prima facie case by "requesting a reasonable accommodation and filing charges of discrimination with the EEOC"); see also Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998), abrogated on other grounds by Burlington N. & Santa Fe. Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006) (holding that a request for a reasonable accommodation is a "statutorily protected activity" if the plaintiff "had a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that he was entitled to those accommodations").
Here, Ms. Okafor has introduced evidence that she engaged in statutorily protected expression. Prior to her termination, she sent Infuserve two notes from Nurse Moreno advising that Ms. Okafor work from home. (See Doc. 27-4 at 3; Doc. 27-9 at 2.) She also wrote to Mr. Quigley stating, "I have provided you and the company with medical documentation from a doctor that has indicated that it is medically necessary for me to stay at home for now due to my pre-existing condition . . . I believe this is a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." (Doc. 27-8 at 6.) These requests to work from home constitute statutorily protected expression under the ADA. Therefore, Ms. Okafor has established the first element in her prima [*53]  facie retaliation claim.
The parties do not dispute that Ms. Okafor suffered an adverse employment action when Infuserve terminated her. Thus Ms. Okafor has also satisfied the second element of a prima facie retaliation claim.
The final piece of an ADA retaliation claim—the causal connection element—can be established "by showing that the protected activity and adverse action were 'not wholly unrelated.'" Rudy v. Walter Coke, Inc., 613 F. App'x 828, 830 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir. 2010). "Generally, an employee can establish that these events were not wholly unrelated by showing that the decisionmaker was aware of the protected conduct at the time of the adverse action." Id. (citation omitted). "Temporal proximity alone does not establish a causal connection when there is unrebutted evidence that the decisionmaker was not aware of the protected activity." Id. (citation omitted). But "[a] close temporal proximity between the protected expression and an adverse action is sufficient circumstantial evidence of a causal connection for purposes of a prima facie case." Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir. 2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
Here, Ms. Okafor has introduced evidence that on March 17, 2020, she was tested for COVID-19 and on March 18, 2020, she was given permission to work remotely [*54]  during the week-long period during which she awaited her results. (Doc. 27-1 at 11-12.) On March 30, 2020, Ms. Okafor was given permission to work remotely Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday each week. (Id. at 14.) On April 6, 2020, Mr. Quigley notified Ms. Okafor that she needed to work full-time in the office starting the following day because it was clear she could not complete her job duties from home. (Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 9.)
On April 7, 2020, Ms. Okafor emailed Mr. Quigley that she was "willing to continue working from home" and attached to this email a note from Nurse Moreno. (Doc. 27-4 at 1-3.) On April 9, 2020, Mr. Quigley placed Ms. Okafor on administrative leave until she was able to be reviewed by a physician because she could not complete her job duties from home. (Doc. 27-7 at 1; Doc. 27-18 at ¶ 12.) On April 14, 2020, Ms. Okafor emailed Mr. Quigley stating that she believed she was entitled to accommodations to work from home given her pre-existing condition—being immunocompromised as a result of her splenectomy—and cited to the FMLA. (See Doc. 27-8 at 5-6.) Mr. Quigley responded the next day and, among other things, provided Ms. Okafor with the proper paperwork for her to request [*55]  medical leave under the FMLA. (Id. at 1-5.)
On May 8, 2020, after a month on unpaid administrative leave, Ms. Okafor submitted another note from Nurse Moreno stating that Ms. Okafor was advised to self-isolate at home and that she "may benefit from telecommuting." (Id. at 1-2.) Mr. Quigley responded on May 11, 2020, indicating that Infuserve could not accommodate Ms. Okafor's request to work remotely because Ms. Okafor still had not been seen by a physician and had not shown that she could complete the essential functions of her job from home. (Doc. 27-10 at 1-2.) And on May 22, 2020, Infuserve terminated Ms. Okafor's employment. (Doc. 27-12 at 2.)
Ms. Okafor asserts that the "close temporal proximity" between her request to work remotely and her termination creates a triable retaliation issue. (Doc. 33 at 19-20.) The Court disagrees. Ms. Okafor's reliance on temporal proximity fails to acknowledge the myriad concessions Infuserve made between Ms. Okafor's initial exposure to COVID-19 and her ultimate termination. For example, Mr. Quigley met with Ms. Okafor about working remotely; he offered Ms. Okafor what she conceded was a reasonable accommodation—namely, the opportunity to work [*56]  remotely three days a week; he placed Ms. Okafor on unpaid administrative leave when she refused to be seen by a physician; he notified Ms. Okafor of the federal benefits she may have been eligible for while she was on unpaid administrative leave; and it was only after Ms. Okafor repeatedly made errors in her job, refused twice to see any physician about her immunocompromised position, and neglected to respond to communications from Mr. Quigley and Mr. Kazarian, that she was terminated. Ultimately, "[c]lose temporal proximity cannot overcome the illogic of her argument." Meyer, 592 Fed. Appx. at 792 (explaining that plaintiff "illogically asserts that [defendant] retaliated against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation by agreeing to meet with her to discuss that request, and then in further retaliation, he agreed to her request").
But even if Ms. Okafor demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to the causal connection between her statutorily protected conduct and the adverse employment action she suffered, summary judgment would still be appropriate because Infuserve has introduced substantial, unrefuted evidence that it had nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating Ms. Okafor. (See Doc. 27-8 [*57]  at 3-4; 27-11 at 3-5.) And Ms. Okafor has introduced no evidence to demonstrate that Infuserve's "proffered reason was pretextual," and "the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision." Martin, 543 F.3d at 1267.
Instead, Ms. Okafor offers a defense of her conduct in the workplace, explaining her unanswered emails, early departures, and failures to see a physician as, essentially, miscommunications and misunderstandings between her, Mr. Quigley, and Mr. Kazarian. (See Doc. 33 at 21-22.) Taking Ms. Okafor's statements as true and further accepting that she had a legitimate reason behind every alleged misdeed or performance inadequacy on the job, Ms. Okafor's testimony would still not prove that the reasons for Ms. Okafor's termination given by Infuserve were pretextual. That is, Ms. Okafor has introduced no evidence that Infuserve had some sort of hidden retaliatory intent or that the performance issues alleged by Infuserve were manufactured for the purpose of getting Ms. Okafor fired.
Without such evidence, Ms. Okafor cannot demonstrate that Infuserve's decision to terminate her was in retaliation for her request for an accommodation. See Burch v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. United, Inc., 608 F. App'x 916, 917 (11th Cir. 2015) ("[E]ven if [plaintiff] [*58]  had established a prima facie retaliation case, he failed to establish that [defendant's] legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for his suspension and termination were false; instead, he simply quarrels with the reasoning and offers explanations for his conduct, which does not establish pretext."). Accordingly, summary judgment is granted for Infuserve with respect to Ms. Okafor's retaliation claims under the ADA and FCRA.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that there are no genuine disputes of material fact, and Infuserve is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Ms. Okafor's FMLA, EFMLEA, ADA, and FCRA claims. Accordingly,
1. Infuserve's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 26) is GRANTED.
2. Infuserve's Motion to Strike Certain Paragraphs and "Exhibit A" of Ms. Okafor's Sworn Declaration Supporting Ms. Okafor's Response to Infuserve's Motion for Summary Judgement and Incorporated Memorandum of Law (Doc. 39) is DENIED as moot.
3. The Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to terminate all pending deadlines and close the case.
ORDERED at Tampa, Florida on March 6, 2023.
