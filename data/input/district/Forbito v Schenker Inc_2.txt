CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): The Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment
Before the Court is Defendant Schenker, Inc.'s ("Defendant") motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, partial summary judgment. See Dkt. # 19-1 ("Mot."). Plaintiff Rocky Forbito ("Plaintiff") has not opposed this motion.1 The Court finds the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. After considering the moving papers, the Court GRANTS the unopposed motion.
I. Background
Defendant is a commercial transportation and logistics company. Complaint, Dkt. # 1-2 ("Compl."), ¶ 8. On November 23, 2015, Plaintiff began working for Defendant as a yard driver. See Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, Dkt. # 19-3 ("SUF"), ¶ 1; Declaration of Michelle Rapoport, Dkt. # 19-2 ("Rapoport Decl."), Ex. 1 at 59:16-19 (Deposition of Rocky Forbito) ("Forbito Dep.")). During his employment, Plaintiff was injured when he tripped over a parking curb while exiting a portable toilet. SUF ¶ 5; Forbito Dep. 47:8-11. Due [*2]  to his injury, his last day of work was December 22, 2015. See SUF ¶ 5; Forbito Dep. 86:2-4.
Plaintiff cannot recall when he first sought medical attention or when he first notified his supervisor of the incident. SUF ¶ 6; Forbito Dep. 55:4-17, 57:2-11. He eventually submitted a doctor's note dated January 5, 2016 to Defendant, though he cannot recall when he did so. SUF ¶¶ 6-7; Forbito Dep. 64:19-65:6, 66:14-20, Ex. C. The doctor's note stated that Plaintiff could not work in his condition and that his return to work date had not been determined. SUF ¶ 7; Forbito Dep., Ex. C. Based on the foregoing, Defendant granted Plaintiff's request for a leave of absence retroactive to December 23, 2015. SUF ¶ 8; Forbito Dep. 73:11-19, 111:6-113:1, Ex. F.
Plaintiff subsequently saw the company doctor on two occasions, once on February 20, 2016 and again on March 20, 2016. SUF ¶¶ 9-10; Forbito Dep. 75:9-18, 78:17-20, 106:5-107:23, 108:11-111:5, Exs. D—E. Each time the doctor issued work restrictions, which included, but were not limited to, limited use of his knee and lower back, no repetitive bending, no climbing, and no driving. See id.
Due to these restrictions, Plaintiff could not perform many [*3]  of the responsibilities of his driver position. SUF ¶ 12; Forbito Dep. 23:18-24:19, 88:18-89:6, 93:16-19. Specifically, Plaintiff could not "hostle," which is, in Plaintiff's words, using "[h]ostler trucks to back up the trailers to the dock and pull them away from the dock, and put them in the lineup." SUF ¶ 12; Forbito Dep. 24:7-9. Hostling was a big part of his job, as he hostled for eleven hours out of his twelve-hour work day before he was injured. SUF ¶ 2; Forbito Dep. 24:14-19. In fact, all of Defendant's drivers were required to both hostle and drive trucks from the loading facility to the offsite storage location. SUF ¶ 3; Forbito Dep. 28:9-29:22.
Plaintiff stated in his deposition that he had discussions with his supervisor and HR about his work restrictions. SUF ¶ 13; Forbito Dep. 89:13-90:23. He further recalled that the person he spoke with explained that if his restrictions prevented him from working as a yard driver, there was no other work for him. SUF ¶ 14; Forbito Dep. 89:13-90:23.
When asked whether Defendant ever notified him that his leave of absence had ended, Plaintiff responded that he did not know. See SUF ¶ 15; Forbito Dep. 113:2-6. In fact, Defendant asserts [*4]  that its personnel records show that Plaintiff was never terminated and that he remains on Defendant's payroll to this day. SUF ¶ 16; Declaration of Dave Grant, Dkt. # 19-2 ("Grant Decl."), ¶ 3.
At some point within the year after the injury, Plaintiff had knee surgery. Forbito Dep. 115:8-116:5. And on June 14, 2016, Plaintiff settled a workers' compensation claim with Defendant. SUF ¶ 19; Forbito Dep. 116:6-16. Since then, he has been working as a driver for other companies without any work restrictions. SUF ¶¶ 20-21; Forbito Dep. 119:1-123:14.
In his deposition, Plaintiff stated that he believes Defendant treated him unfairly because it did not offer him another position before he took the leave of absence. See SUF ¶ 21; Forbito Dep. 157:2-157:3. When asked what position he believed he should have been offered, Plaintiff stated that his current employer offers light duty positions that do paperwork for its drivers hurt on the job. SUF ¶ 21; Forbito Dep. 158:4-15. However, Plaintiff also admitted that he never saw anyone at Defendant's workplace doing paperwork, and that he did not know of any other position at Defendant's workplace that he would have qualified for. SUF ¶¶ 21-22; Forbito [*5]  Dep. 142:1-3, 158:21-159:14. Even so, Plaintiff stated that he believed Defendant should have created a job for him. See SUF ¶ 21; Forbito Dep. 159:9-14.
On September 29, 2017, Plaintiff brought this suit in California Superior Court. See generally Compl. In it, he asserts five causes of action under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"):
First cause of action: Disability discrimination. Id. ¶¶ 30-37.
Second cause of action: Failure to accommodate a disability. Id. ¶¶ 38-46.
Third cause of action: Failure to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process. Id. ¶¶ 47-54.
Fourth cause of action: Retaliation. Id. ¶¶ 55-61.
Fifth cause of action: Wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Id. ¶¶ 62-68.
Defendant removed the case to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See Notice of Removal, Dkt. # 1. It now moves for summary judgment on all counts, arguing that it is entitled to prevail as a matter of law. See generally Mot.
II. Legal Standard
"A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that [*6]  there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the nonmoving party will have the burden of proof at trial, the movant can prevail by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support the moving party's case. See id. If the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. Rather, it draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987). The evidence presented by the parties must be admissible. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See Thornhill Publ'g Co. v. Gen. Tel. & Elecs. Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).
III. Discussion [*7] 
The Court will consider each of Plaintiff's five causes of action in turn.
A. First Cause of Action: Disability Discrimination
The FEHA prohibits employment practices that discriminate against any person because of his disability. Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(a). In order to make out a prima facie case for discrimination, the plaintiff must show that "(1) he suffers from a physical disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and, (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability." Arteaga v. Brink's Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 344-45, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008) (quoting Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 886, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007)). "On a motion for summary judgment brought against such a cause of action the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination based upon physical disability, and the burden then shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." Faust, 150 Cal. App. 4th at 886. Once the employer articulates a nondiscriminatory reason, the plaintiff must offer evidence that the stated reason is pretext for discrimination. Id.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim for disability discrimination fails because he cannot point to evidence of an "adverse employment action." Mot. 7:3-24. An adverse employment action is one that affects the "terms, conditions [*8]  and privileges of employment." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1054, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). In his complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he suffered an adverse employment action because Defendant "effectively terminat[ed] Plaintiff on the basis of Plaintiff's disability or perceived disability, fail[ed] to engage in the interactive process in good faith to determine if Plaintiff could be given a reasonable accommodation and fail[ed] to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation." Compl. ¶ 32. However, Plaintiff admitted in his deposition that he does not know whether he was ever told that his leave of absence ended, and Defendant has presented evidence from its personnel records that Plaintiff was never terminated. SUF ¶¶ 15-16. To the extent that Plaintiff is claiming that Defendant constructively discharged him, he must be able to prove that "a reasonable person faced with the allegedly intolerable employer actions or conditions of employment would have no reasonable alternative except to quit." Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 1248, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994). Yet, as Defendant points out, Plaintiff has not made any specific allegations to that effect. Mot. 7:23; see generally Compl. To the contrary, it is undisputed that Defendant granted Plaintiff's request for a leave of absence and has kept him [*9]  on payroll to this day. See SUF ¶¶ 8, 16; Grant Decl. ¶ 3.
Based on these facts, Defendant has adequately shown that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because there is no evidence to support Plaintiff's allegation that he was "effectively terminated" due to his disability. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. Therefore, the burden has shifted to Plaintiff to produce "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial" on the question of whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 248. As Plaintiff entirely failed to respond to Defendant's motion, he has not met this burden. As such, the Court concludes that there is no genuine issue of fact here and GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the first cause of action.
B. Second Cause of Action: Failure to Accommodate
The elements of a reasonable accommodation cause of action are that (1) the plaintiff suffered a disability, (2) he could perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation, and (3) the defendant failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability. Wilson v. Cty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009). Defendant contends that Plaintiff's claim fails because Plaintiff could not perform an essential function [*10]  of the driver position due to his medical restrictions and because Defendant did provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation in the form of a leave of absence.
An "essential function" refers to "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f). Here, it is undisputed that all drivers of Defendant were required to hostle and to drive trucks from the facility to an offsite storage location. SUF ¶ 3. Because Plaintiff was instructed by the company doctor to limit the use of his knee and avoid climbing or driving, and because hostling would have strained his knees, it is undisputed that the medical restrictions prevented Plaintiff from performing a significant part of the job as a yard driver. See SUF ¶¶ 2, 9-10, 12; Forbito Dep. 93:16-19. Therefore, Defendant has demonstrated that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of the driver position due to his medical restrictions. The burden thus shifts to Plaintiff to point to evidence that creates a genuine issue of fact.
Plaintiff suggested in his deposition that Defendant should have offered a light duty position for him to do paperwork. See SUF ¶ 21. However, Plaintiff [*11]  also admitted that he never saw anyone at Defendant's workplace who did such "light duty" work and that he did not know of an open position that Plaintiff could perform. Id. ¶ 22. California courts have consistently held that employers are not required to create a new position to reasonably accommodate an employee. See Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1222-26, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899 (2006) ("[A]n employer has no duty . . . to accommodate a disabled employee by making a temporary accommodation permanent if doing so would require the employer to create a new position just for the employee[.]"); see also Spitzer v. Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1389, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000) ("The responsibility to reassign a disabled employee who cannot be otherwise accommodated does not require creating a new job, moving another employee, promoting the disabled employee, or violating another employee's rights under a collective bargaining agreement.") (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, there is no evidence indicating that Defendant had vacant positions for which Plaintiff might have been suited with his medical restrictions, and Defendant was under no obligation to create such a position.
Instead, when Plaintiff submitted a doctor's note about his physical disability and asked for a leave of absence, Defendant granted this request. [*12]  SUF ¶¶ 7-8. Courts have found that a leave of absence can be an acceptable form of a reasonable accommodation, see, e.g., Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999), and Plaintiff has not presented any evidence to suggest that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether his leave of absence was a reasonable accommodation under the circumstances.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the second cause of action.
C. Third Cause of Action: Failure to Engage in a Timely, Good Faith, Interactive Process
The interactive process required under the FEHA is "an informal process with the employee or the employee's representative, to attempt to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (quoting Wilson, 169 Cal. App. 4th at 1195). To prevail on a claim for failure to engage in an interactive process, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he has a disability; (2) he requested a reasonable accommodation for his disability; and (3) the defendant failed to engage in a timely, good faith interactive process with him. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). To prevail, "an employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018-19; see [*13]  also Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 980-83, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008).
Here, it is undisputed that Defendant granted Plaintiff's request for a leave of absence and that there is no evidence to suggest that his leave of absence ever ended. SUF ¶¶ 8, 15. Defendant sent Plaintiff to two physician evaluations to determine the extent of Plaintiff's injuries, and each time Plaintiff was given medical restrictions preventing him from performing his job. See id. ¶¶ 9-10. Further, Plaintiff recalls having discussions with his supervisor and HR about his work restrictions. Id. ¶ 13. He stated that Defendant's employees informed him that if the medical restrictions prevented him from working in the yard as a driver, there was no other available work for him. Id. ¶ 14. Therefore, Defendant has presented sufficient evidence that it engaged in a process with Plaintiff to identify a reasonable accommodation in good faith. Moreover, as discussed above, Defendant has shown that there is no evidence to suggest that reasonable accommodations other than granting Plaintiff's request for a leave of absence were available. The burden has thus shifted to Plaintiff to point to evidence that creates a genuine issue of fact as to whether Defendant violated his duty to engage [*14]  in the interactive process or whether there were other reasonable accommodations available at the time the interactive process should have occurred. As Plaintiff has not met this burden, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the third cause of action.
D. Fourth Cause of Action: Retaliation
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show that "(1) [he] engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042. Plaintiff alleges in his complaint that because Plaintiff claimed a work-related injury and requested an accommodation, Defendant retaliated by "effectively terminat[ing] Plaintiff's employment." Compl. ¶¶ 56-57. However, as discussed above, Plaintiff has presented no evidence to support the notion that he was actually or constructively terminated. Without evidence of an adverse employment action, Plaintiff cannot make out a viable claim for retaliation. As such, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the fourth cause of action.
E. Fifth Cause of Action: Wrongful [*15]  Termination in Violation of Public Policy
Plaintiff contends that he was wrongfully terminated against public policy on two grounds: based on the FEHA's prohibition against disability discrimination, id. ¶ 64, and based on California Labor Code § 132a. Mot. 12:13-16. Each claim will be considered in turn.

i. Wrongful Termination Claim Based on FEHA Violations
To establish a wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim, the plaintiff must establish a violation of an underlying constitutional or statutory provision. See Jennings v. Marralle, 78 Cal. 4th 121, 130 (1994). Here, Plaintiff's claim is based on the same facts as his FEHA claims. As discussed above, the Court has already concluded those claims fail. Since Plaintiff cannot show an underlying violation of public policy under the statute, this wrongful termination claim also necessarily fails.

ii. Wrongful Termination Claim Based on Labor Code § 132a Violation
In the alternative to a FEHA violation, Plaintiff relies on California Labor Code § 132a as a basis for his wrongful discrimination claim. Section 132a states that "there should not be discrimination against workers who are injured in the course of their employment." Cal. Lab. Code § 132a. However, the California Court of Appeals has already concluded that section 132a "cannot serve as a basis for a tort claim of wrongful termination [*16]  in violation of public policy," because the statute "establishes a specific procedure and forum for addressing a violation" and "limits the remedies that are available once a violation is established." Dutra v. Mercy Med. Ctr. Mt. Shasta, 209 Cal. App. 4th 750, 756, 146 Cal. Rptr. 3d 922 (2012). Therefore, Plaintiff's claim based on the policy stated in Labor Code § 132a fails as a matter of law.
As such, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the fifth cause of action.
IV. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on all claims. Defendant is ORDERED to prepare and submit a judgment consistent with this order by December 5, 2018.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
