CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Docket No. 35]
This matter is before the Court on Plaintiff Marcia Gayle's ("Plaintiff") Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion" or "MSJ"), filed December 9, 2019 (ECF No. 35). Defendants John Borg, Deborah Borg, Frederick F. Frakes, Nickey L. Frakes, and Minute Serve Dairy, Inc., (collectively, "Defendants") filed an opposition ("Opposition") to the Motion on December 23, 2019 (ECF No. 36). Plaintiff filed a reply ("Reply") in support of the Motion on December 30, 2019. The Court found this matter suitable for disposition without oral argument and vacated the hearing set for January 13, 2020. For the reasons stated below, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion.
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
A. Factual Background 1
Plaintiff is a paraplegic who has dexterity issues in her hands, and she requires a wheelchair for mobility because she cannot walk. (Pl.'s Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law ("SUF") No. 1, ECF No. 35-2.) Plaintiff has a specially equipped minivan [*2]  with hand controls and a ramp that deploys from the passenger side of the van to accommodate her wheelchair. (SUF No. 2.) Plaintiff alleges the property known as Minute Serve Dairy ("Gas Station"), located at or about 3113 Rancho Vista Boulevard in Palmdale, California, is owned by Defendants, and violates several provisions of the ADA. (See generally Compl.) Defendants own the Gas Station business and the real property on which the Gas Station is located. (SUF Nos. 3-6.) The Gas Station is a business open to the public, and it is a place of accommodation. (SUF No. 7.)
In the Declaration of John G. Borg, Defendants state that the Gas Station was completed in 1998. (Declaration of John G. Borg ("Borg Decl.") ¶ 2, ECF No. 36-2.) Borg states that the City of Palmdale inspected and approved the facility and issued a business license. (Borg Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.) As of the date that Plaintiff visited the Gas Station, there had been no alterations to the grounds since 1998. (Borg Decl. ¶ 5.)
On August 12, 2018, Plaintiff pumped gas into her car at the Gas Station, but needed to enter the convenience store to retrieve her receipt as the pump's machine would not print her receipt. (SUF No. 9.) While [*3]  on the property, Plaintiff noticed a number of barriers that allegedly violate the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Plaintiff saw that there was a parking space in front of the convenience store with blue striping that had the International Symbol of Accessibility ("ISA"), but the parking stall and adjacent aisle had a concrete ramp extending into each space, which caused them to be sloped. (SUF Nos. 10-11.) Plaintiff also did not see fine warning or tow away signage posted near the parking space. (SUF No. 12.) Plaintiff states that she needs an eight foot access aisle that gives sufficient room for her to deploy her ramp. (SUF No. 13.) Also, the access aisle must be flat allowing her ramp to stay level on the ground so that she will not tip over while descending from her vehicle. (SUF No. 14.) Plaintiff declares that she could not exit her vehicle, and her husband was required to enter the convenience store to obtain her receipt. (SUF No. 15.)
Plaintiff hired an investigator, Evens Louis, to conduct an investigation into potential ADA violations at the Gas Station. (SUF No. 17.) Mr. Louis visited the site on October 3, 2018 and witnessed the barriers that Plaintiff originally [*4]  identified. (Id.) According to Mr. Louis, the Gas Station had 9 parking spaces for its customers, one of which was marked and reserved for use by persons with disabilities. (SUF No. 18.) Mr. Louis saw that the access aisle was not level with the parking space, because there was a concrete ramp extending into both areas that caused them to be sloped. (SUF No. 19.) Mr. Louis's gauge determined that the parking stall's slope measured 2.8%, and the access aisle's slope measured 8.6%. (SUF No. 20.) Mr. Louis also did not see minimum fine, tow away, or van accessible signage at or near the parking space, and the access aisle did not contain a "No Parking" sign. (SUF Nos. 21-22.) Mr. Louis then entered the convenience store and found that the narrowest pathway measured 32 inches in width. (SUF Nos. 23-24.) Mr. Louis also found that the mirror inside the Gas Station's bathroom was mounted 47 inches above the floor. (SUF No. 25.) After the complaint was filed in this case, Defendants made a number of changes to the Gas Station. (SUF No. 26.)
Plaintiffs then hired Corey Taylor, another investigator, to conduct a second inspection of the Gas Station. (SUF No. 27.) Mr. Taylor visited the location [*5]  on November 20, 2019, and found that the parking space reserved for use by disabled persons was repainted, the ramp affecting the slope of the access aisle and parking spot remained unchanged, minimum fine warning and ISA signage were posted near the parking spot, the spot lacked signage indicating that the space was van accessible, and the parking aisle lacked the "No Parking" sign. (SUF Nos. 27-31.) Mr. Taylor then entered the convenience store and found that an access aisle measured 33 inches wide, and the bathroom mirror was missing. (SUF Nos. 32-33.)
Plaintiff lives roughly ten miles from the Gas Station and states that it is a convenient place for her to pump her gas. (SUF No. 34.) She claims that she intends to return to the Gas Station on a regular basis when the need arises. (SUF No. 35.)
B. Procedural History
Plaintiff initiated this action on October 22, 2018, by filing the Complaint (ECF No. 1) seeking: (1) injunctive relief requiring Defendants to comply with the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act ("Unruh Act"); (2) $4,000 in actual and statutory damages under the Unruh Act; and (3) reasonable attorney fees and litigation expenses. (Compl. 10-11.) Defendants answered the [*6]  Complaint on November 30, 2018. (ECF No. 10.)
The Court held a Scheduling Conference on March 4, 2019. (ECF No. 15.) Defendant's attorney failed to appear or notify the Court before the hearing why there was no appearance. (Id.) The Court set a hearing on an order to show cause regarding when the event alleged in the Complaint occurred, and whether the Court should sever the state law claim from the federal claim. (Id.) The Court then determined the date the incident took place, and that severance was not appropriate, as the state law claim does not "substantially predominate" over the claim for injunctive relief under the ADA. (Min. Ord., ECF No. 21.)
On December 9, 2019, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendants opposed the Motion on December 23, 2019. Plaintiff filed a Reply in support of the Motion on December 30, 2019.
These proceedings followed.
II. DISCUSSION
A. Legal Standards
1. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate when the Court determines that there is "no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The substantive law underlying the claims and defenses at issue will [*7]  determine which facts are material. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248. Only disputes over facts "that might effect the outcome of the suit . . . will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Id. Likewise, a dispute is "genuine" only if the evidence is such that it could "reasonably be resolved in favor of either party." Id. at 250.
Rule 56 requires the moving party to make a prima facie showing that it is entitled to summary judgment. Celotex Corp. v Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 331, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The manner in which this burden can be satisfied differs depending on "which party will bear the burden of persuasion on the challenged claim at trial." Id. If the nonmoving party bears this burden, then the moving party must adduce evidence that either (1) negates one of the challenged claim's essential elements; or (2) demonstrates that the nonmoving party's evidence is insufficient to establish an essential element. Id. On the other hand, if the moving party bears the burden of persuasion, then it must establish every "element essential to that party's [claim], and on which [it] bear[s] the burden of proof at trial" with credible evidence sufficient to "entitle it to a directed verdict" if left uncontroverted at trial. Id.
If the movant meets its initial burden, then the nonmoving party must [*8]  "come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party may not rest on mere allegations, but must instead support its averred facts with evidence sufficient to enable a reasonable jury to find in its favor. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252. "If the nonmoving party cannot muster sufficient evidence to make out its claim. . . the moving party is entitled to summary judgment." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 331.
2. Title III of the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act
To succeed on an ADA discrimination claim, Plaintiff must show: "(1) [Plaintiff] is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) the plaintiff was denied public accommodations by the defendant because of [her] disability." Arizona ex rel. Goddard v. Harkins Amusement Enters., Inc., 603 F.3d 666, 670 (9th Cir. 2010).
Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the "full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation" with a nexus in interstate commerce. 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000a(b), 12182(a). Compliance with the ADA requires that new facilities be "readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities," unless this would be "structurally [*9]  impracticable." 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1). For existing facilities, discrimination includes "a failure to remove architectural barriers . . . where such removal is readily achievable." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv).
"In general, a facility is 'readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities' if it meets the requirements promulgated by the Attorney General in the 'ADA Accessibility Guidelines' or the 'ADAAG,' which is essentially an encyclopedia of design standards." Oliver v. Ralphs Grocery Co., 654 F.3d 903, 905 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing 28 C.F.R. § 36.406). "If a particular architectural feature of a place of public accommodation is inconsistent with the ADAAG, a plaintiff can bring a civil action claiming that the feature constitutes a barrier that denies the plaintiff full and equal enjoyment of the premises in violation of the ADA." Id. (citations omitted).
Finally, "[b]ecause a private plaintiff can sue only for injunctive relief (i.e., for removal of the barrier) under the ADA . . . a defendant's voluntary removal of alleged barriers prior to trial can have the effect of mooting a plaintiff's ADA claim." Id. (citing Hubbard v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1145 (S.D. Cal. 2006)).
The Unruh Act provides: "All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national [*10]  origin, disability, medical condition, marital status, or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever." Cal. Civ. Code § 51(b). Moreover, the Unruh Act provides that a "violation of the right of any individual under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 shall also constitute a violation of this section." Cal. Civ. Code § 51(f) (citation and footnote omitted). A violation of the ADA constitutes a violation of the Unruh Act, which yields a statutory violation of $4,000. Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 731 (9th Cir. 2007).
B. Analysis
The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff is a disabled person or that Defendants own a place of public accommodation. The instant controversy centers on the third element Plaintiff must establish for her ADA claim: whether Plaintiff was denied access to the public accommodations at the Gas Station due to her disability.
As detailed below, Plaintiff has standing to pursue her ADA and Unruh Act claims. The crux of Defendants' defense—that the 1991 ADAAG Standards apply to the Gas Station—relies on a misinterpretation of the relevant regulations. Against the applicable 2010 ADAAG Standards, the Gas Station's slope, signage, [*11]  and convenience store aisles are discriminatory and violate the ADA. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's request for an injunction and awards Plaintiff $4,000 in statutory damages.
1. Plaintiff Has Standing
The first issue is whether Plaintiff has standing to pursue her claims. Defendants argue that Plaintiff lacks standing because Plaintiff has filed at least 20 complaints in the last 3 years, which, Defendants argue, undermines Plaintiff's assertion that she intends to return to the Gas Station. (Opp'n 4.) Plaintiff responds that she has standing to challenge the alleged ADA violations because she lives roughly 10 miles from the Gas Station and intends to return when the architectural barriers are removed. (MSJ 14, Reply 5.) While Plaintiff's standing argument is weak, she has submitted enough evidence for the Court to conclude that she has standing in this case.
"[T]o satisfy Article III's standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an 'injury in fact' that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed [*12]  to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision." Kirola v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 860 F.3d 1164, 1174 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed. 2d 610 (2000)). A plaintiff seeking prospective relief must also show a likelihood of future injury. Kirola, 860 F.3d at 1174. The Supreme Court has instructed courts "to take a broad view of constitutional standing in civil rights cases, especially where, as under the ADA, private enforcement suits 'are the primary method of obtaining compliance with the Act.'" Doran v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 524 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting Trafficante v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 209, 93 S. Ct. 364, 34 L. Ed. 2d 415 (1972)).
Where a plaintiff seeks prospective relief, Article III "requires a sufficient showing of likely injury in the future related to the plaintiff's disability to ensure that injunctive relief will vindicate the rights of the particular plaintiff rather than the rights of third parties." Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 949 (9th Cir. 2011). Injury in fact is established where the plaintiff "encounter[s] at least one barrier that interfered with her access to the particular public facility and whether she intends to return or is deterred from returning to that facility." Kirola, 860 F.3d at 1175.
Plaintiff has Article III standing. Plaintiff has established an injury in fact by demonstrating that she encountered more than one barrier at the Gas Station, including the sloped parking stall and access aisle and inadequate [*13]  parking signage. (See SUF Nos. 13-16). Plaintiff has also established through her declaration that she is deterred from returning to the Gas Station. She states that the "Gas Station is located just ten miles away from [her] home and is therefore a convenient place for [her] to pump gas." (Declaration of Marcia Gayle ("Gayle Decl.") ¶ 14, ECF No. 35-5.) Plaintiff "would like the ability to safely and independently park and access the Gas Station." (Id.) Plaintiff also declares that she intends to return to the Gas Station on a regular basis once the architectural barriers are removed. (Gayle Decl. ¶ 15.)
Ten miles is quite close to one's abode, which strongly supports Plaintiff's claim that she will return to the Gas Station once the barriers are remedied. Absent unique circumstances, the vast majority of drivers are likely to stop at a Gas Station located 10 miles from their home. Aside from casting aspersions, Defendant has provided no evidence calling Plaintiff's assertions into question. Although Plaintiff could have further supported her position by documenting her past patronage, showing concrete future plans, and explaining the frequency of travel near the facility, the facts [*14]  at the Court's disposal demonstrate that Plaintiff is currently deterred from visiting the Gas Station due to the architectural barriers in place.
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's status as an ADA "tester" shows that Plaintiff does not intend to return to the Gas Station. But the fact that Plaintiff has filed multiple cases in recent years does not mandate that she will not return to Defendants' Gas Station; rather, the Court must look objectively at the facts before it to determine whether Plaintiff has met her burden to prove
standing. See Molski v. Arby's Huntington Beach, 359 F. Supp. 2d 938, 945 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (stating that an ADA's plaintiff's "hundreds of virtually identical lawsuits throughout the Central District of California . . . is irrelevant for purposes of this Court's examination of its own jurisdiction"). And as just discussed, the facts set forth in Plaintiff's declaration evidence that she is currently deterred from shopping at the Gas Station due to the barriers in place.
Defendants' position that the Plaintiff's intent is a disputed material fact requiring a trial is incorrect; Defendants forget that jurisdictional questions such as standing are determined by judges, not juries. See Chapman, 631 F.3d at 954 (stating that courts must analyze jurisdictional questions [*15]  such as standing); Vogel v. Winchell's Donut Houses Operating Co., L.P., 252 F. Supp. 3d 977, 984 (C.D. Cal. 2017) (setting forth the factual standing inquiry a court must undergo to determine whether an ADA plaintiff has the intent to return to the defendant's establishment, and determining, on summary judgment, that the plaintiff had standing to pursue his ADA claim). Thus, the Court rejects Defendants' argument that the case must proceed to trial to determine whether Plaintiff has standing to pursue her claims.
Having concluded that Plaintiff suffered an injury in fact, the Court must now analyze the second and third elements of the standing test: whether the injury is traceable to the challenged action of Defendants, and whether a favorable decision will redress the injury. There is no dispute that the alleged architectural barriers at the Gas Station are traceable to the Defendants, because Defendants own the Gas Station. Also, the injury is capable of being remedied through an injunction ordering the Defendants to fix the architectural barriers at the Gas Station. Thus, Plaintiff has established all three elements of the standing test.
The Ninth Circuit has stated that "[o]nce a disabled individual has encountered or become aware of alleged ADA violations that deter [her] [*16]  patronage of or otherwise interfere with [her] access to a place of public accommodation, [she] has already suffered an injury in fact traceable to the defendant's conduct and capable of being redressed by the courts, and so [she] possesses standing under Article III . . . ." Doran, 524 F.3d at 1042 n. 5. That scenario is precisely the case here: on August 12, 2018, Plaintiff encountered the ADA violations that interfered with her ability to enter the convenience store and obtain her receipt, so she suffered an injury in fact traceable to Defendants that this Court can address through an injunction. Thus, Plaintiff has established standing.
Although Defendants do not address the issue in their Opposition, the Court notes that Plaintiff has standing to challenge all of the ADA violations at the Gas Station, including those she did not personally encounter. See Chapman, 631 F.3d at 944 ("[A]n ADA plaintiff who establishes standing as to encountered barriers may also sue for injunctive relief as to unencountered barriers related to his disability.") The fact that Plaintiff could not enter the convenience store and never personally encountered the narrow aisles or high bathroom mirror does not preclude her from challenging those alleged [*17]  ADA violations.
2. The 2010 Standards Apply
Defendants' primary defense to Plaintiff's claims is that the Safe Harbor provision exempts the Gas Station from complying with the 2010 Standards, and the Gas Station must instead comply with the applicable 1991 Standards. (Opp'n 3.) Plaintiff argues that even though the Gas Station was built in 1998, it never complied with the 1991 Standards, so the law requires the Gas Station to comply with the 2010 Standards. (Reply 1-2.)
Facilities constructed or altered on or after January 26, 1992 and before September 15, 2010, are required to comply with the 1991 Standards. 28 C.F.R. § 36.406(a), Appendix to § 36.406(a). If a facility constructed during that time frame does not comply with the 1991 Standards, it must be altered accordingly:
Newly constructed or altered facilities or elements covered by §§ 36.401 or 36.402 that were constructed or altered before March 15, 2012 and that do not comply with the 1991 Standards shall, on or after March 15, 2012, be made accessible in accordance with the 2010 Standards.
See 28 C.F.R. § 36.406(a)(5)(ii) (emphasis added). The statute leaves no room for arguing that removing the barrier is not readily achievable; instead the statute requires that where a barrier exists in a facility built [*18]  or altered prior to March 15, 2012, that does not comply with the 1991 Standards, the owner must remedy the violation. See id. If the noncompliance is determined on or after March 15, 2012, the building must be altered to comply with the 2010 Standards. Id.
Here, the evidence shows that the Gas Station was completed in 1998 and was not altered as of the date of Plaintiff's visit. (Borg Decl. ¶¶ 2, 5.) That means the building was required to comply with the 1991 Guidelines when it was completed. But the Gas Station has barriers that fail to comply with the 1991 barriers. For example, the 1991 Standards require that all parking spaces and access aisles "be level with surface slopes not exceeding 1:50 (2%) in all directions." 28 C.F.R. Part 36, Appendix A § 4.6.3. The undisputed evidence shows that there remains a ramp that extends into the parking stall and access aisle, making those areas sloped at 2.8% and 8.6% respectively. (SUF No. 20.) The slopes existed in 1998 when the Gas Station was completed, and they failed to comply with the 1991 Standards.
Thus, pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations, Defendants are required to bring the Gas Station into compliance with the 2010 Standards. See 28 C.F.R. § 36.406(a)(5)(ii). This obligation remains regardless [*19]  of whether the modifications are readily achievable, as the regulation states that facilities that do not comply with the 1991 Standards "shall" comply with the 2010 Standards. Id.
It appears that Defendants seek shelter under the City of Palmdale's 1998 inspection of the Gas Station. (See Borg Decl. ¶ 3.) Because the Gas Station passed the City of Palmdale's final inspection and received a business license, Defendants imply that the Gas Station complied with the ADA at that time. (See id.) But Defendants present no evidence that the City of Palmdale's inspection included reviewing any of the ADAAG Standards. Without that information, there is no basis in the record for assuming that the Gas Station complied with the ADAAG Standards when the facility was completed in 1998. As such, the 2010 Standards apply to the Gas Station.
3. Application of the 2010 Standards to the Architectural Barriers at the Gas Station
a. Architectural Barrier 1: Slope of Parking Stall and Access Aisle
Under the 2010 Standards, "[a]ccess aisles shall be at the same level as the parking spaces they serve. Changes in level are not permitted. Exception: Slopes not steeper than 1:48 shall be permitted." 36 C.F.R. Pt. 1191, Appendix D, ("2010 Standards") [*20]  § 502.4.
Plaintiff asserts that the parking space had a concrete ramp extending into it several feet, which caused the area to be sloped. (SUF No. 11.) The concrete ramp also extends into the access aisle and sloped that surface as well. (Id.) Both of Plaintiff's experts confirmed this fact. Mr. Louis's gauge determined that the parking stall's slope measured 2.8% and the access aisle's slope measured 8.6%. (SUF No. 20.) Mr. Taylor also noticed that the parking stall and slope were sloped. (SUF 29.) Defendant submitted no admissible evidence challenging these facts. Therefore, the parking stall's 2.8% slope and the access aisle's 8.6% slope both constitute architectural barriers that violate the 2010 Standards.
b. Architectural Barrier 2: Signage of Parking Stall and Access Aisle
Plaintiff also claims that the parking stall and access aisle lack proper signage. Under the 2010 Standards, "[s]igns identifying van parking spaces shall contain the designation 'van accessible.'" 2010 Standards § 502.6. Mr. Louis and Mr. Taylor observed that the parking stall lacked a sign indicating that the spot is van accessible. (SUF Nos. 21, 31.) Because Defendants present no contradictory evidence, the lack of a van [*21]  accessible sign violates the ADA.
The 2010 Standards state that "[a]ccess aisles shall be marked so as to discourage parking in them." 2010 Standards § 502.3.3. Mr. Louis observed that the access aisle lacked a "No Parking" sign. (SUF No. 22.) Defendants' fail to rebut this evidence, so the lack of appropriate signage discouraging parking in the access aisle violates the ADA.
Plaintiff's claims regarding the minimum fine warning and tow-away signs depend on California regulations, which do not establish violations of the ADA. The ADAAG does not require tow-away signs, nor does it mandate a minimum fine warning. But the California Building Codes require a sign near a parking spot designated for a person with disabilities to state "Minimum Fine $250," and there must be signage stating that unauthorized vehicles parked in stalls designated for disabled persons will be towed away at the owner's expense. California Building Codes § 1129B.4. The question is whether these California regulations establish standards that, if violated, constitute discrimination under the ADA.
The many courts in this circuit to address the issue have concluded that a claim under the ADA can be made only by reference to the ADAAG [*22]  standards, not state or local standards. See, e.g., Johnson v. Cala Stevens Creek/Monroe, LLC, 401 F. Supp. 3d 904, 913 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that "the ADAAG incorporates the California Building Code . . . as the standard for properly marking an accessible parking space under the ADA"); Shaw v. Kelley, No. 16-CV-03768-VKD, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21936, 2019 WL 497620, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 7, 2019) ("[A] purported failure to comply with a provision of the California Building Code is not a violation of the ADA."); Johnson v. Siu Keung Chan, No. 2:17-cv-00138-KJM-AC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98842, 2019 WL 2448223, at *4 (E.D. Cal. June 11, 2019) ("[T]he [California Business Code] requirements are not mandatory, and failure to comply with them does not amount to a violation of the ADA.") (quoting Johnson v. Lababedy, No. 2:16-CV-0126 KJM AC, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101392, 2016 WL 4087061, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 2, 2016); Oliver v. Ralph's Grocery Co., No. 07 CV 2301 JLS (POR), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140732, 2009 WL 10680616, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 26, 2009) ("[T]he ADAAG's provisions do not incorporate state-law standards into the substance of the ADA itself and therefore 'are irrelevant for ADA purposes.'"). But see Rush v. Castle & Cooke Corona Inc., No. CV 10-8952-GW(PLAX), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162906, 2011 WL 13109296, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 10, 2011) (holding that a plaintiff can state a claim under the ADA without finding a violation of the ADAAG). The Court agrees with the reasoning of the those decisions and holds that violations of the California Building Code do not constitute discrimination under the ADA. Therefore, [*23]  Plaintiff's claims that the Gas Station violates the ADA because it lacks tow-away and minimum fine signage fails as a matter of law because the ADAAG does not have such requirements.
In sum, Plaintiff's uncontroverted evidence proves that Defendants violated the ADA by failing to erect signs (1) indicating that the parking stall is van accessible and (2) discouraging parking in the access aisle. However, Plaintiff's arguments fail to the extent Plaintiff asserts that the Gas Station's lack of minimum fine and tow away signs violate the ADA.
c. Architectural Barrier 3: Path of Travel in Convenience Store
The 2010 Standards require that paths of travel in public accommodations be at least 36 inches wide. 2010 Standards § 403.5.1. Both of Plaintiff's experts observed aisles that measured less than 36 inches; Mr. Louis saw that the narrowest aisle measured 32 inches, (SUF Nos. 23-24), and Mr. Taylor's investigation determined that the narrowest aisle measured 33 inches, (SUF No. 32). Defendant has not submitted any evidence on this issue. Thus, the Court is bound to conclude that the evidence establishes the aisles at the Gas Station violate the 2010 Standards.
d. Architectural Barrier 4: Mirror in [*24]  Restroom
Where a public accommodation has a mirror in the restroom above the lavatory, the mirror must be mounted no more than 40 inches above the floor. 2010 Standards § 603.3. Upon entering the restroom, Mr. Louis found that the bathroom's mirror was mounted 47 inches above the floor. (SUF No. 25.) But when Mr. Taylor returned to the Gas Station on November 20, 2019, he found that the mirror in the restroom was removed. (SUF No. 33.)
"Where . . . a private plaintiff brings an ADA claim seeking to enjoin a defendant to remove an architectural barrier, removal of the barrier before final judgment moots the ADA claim based on that barrier." Rodriguez v. Barrita, Inc., 10 F. Supp. 3d 1062, 1078 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (quoting Hernandez v. Polanco Enterprises, Inc., 19 F. Supp. 3d 918 (N.D. Cal. 2013)). Therefore, because Defendants have addressed the noncompliant mirror (by simply removing the mirror), Plaintiff's claim regarding that barrier is moot.
4. Plaintiff's Unruh Civil Rights Act Claim
In addition to pursuing ADA claims, Plaintiff's complaint alleges a violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. (See generally Compl.) The Unruh Act promises full and equal public accommodation for individuals with disabilities. Cal. Civ. Code § 51(b). A violation of the ADA constitutes a violation of the Unruh Act. Cal. Civ. Code § 51(f) (citation and footnote omitted). Here, Plaintiff's Unruh Act [*25]  claim is exclusively based on her ADA claim. (See Compl. ¶¶ 56-59.) Thus, the ADA violations that the Court identified above constitute violations of the Unruh Act as well.
5. Remedies
Plaintiff seeks an injunction requiring Defendants to modify the Gas Station to comply with the ADA, and $4,000 in statutory damages under the Unruh Act. (See Compl. 10-11.) As discussed above, the Court found the following violations of the ADA's 2010 Standards: (1) the Gas Station's parking stall and access aisle violate § 502.4 that limits the permissible slope of those surfaces; (2) the signage at the Gas Station violates § 502.6 that requires a "van accessible" sign and § 502.3.3 that requires a sign to discourage parking in the access aisle; and (3) the narrow paths of travel in the convenience store violate § 403.5.1 that prohibits the paths from being less than 36 inches wide.
Where a plaintiff succeeds on an ADA claim, "injunctive relief shall include an order to alter facilities to make such facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities to the extent required by this subchapter." 42 U.S.C.A. § 12188(a). Therefore, the Court must issue an injunction ordering the Defendants to address the violations found in this order. [*26]  As such, the Court orders Plaintiff to file a proposed order within 10 days of the date this order issues consistent with the order's holdings.
In addition, a violation of the ADA yields a violation of the Unruh Act, which carries with it a statutory violation of $4,000. Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 731 (9th Cir. 2007). Plaintiff need not prove actual damages to obtain the $4,000 award of statutory damages. Id. Thus, Defendants' ADA violations require the Court to award Plaintiff $4,000 in statutory damages under the Unruh Act.
III. RULING
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court awards Plaintiff $4,000 in statutory damages and grants Plaintiff's request for an injunction.
Within 10 days of the date this order issues, Plaintiff must file a proposed order consistent with this opinion and sets forth Plaintiff's requested injunctive relief.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
