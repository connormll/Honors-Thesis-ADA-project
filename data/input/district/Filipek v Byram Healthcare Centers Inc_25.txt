ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Dkt. 44]

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Scott Filipek filed this action against Defendants Byram Healthcare Centers, Inc., and unnamed Does in Orange County Superior Court after his employment in the warehouse department of Defendant's Huntington Beach facility was terminated. (Dkt. 1-2 [State Court Complaint].) Plaintiff brought six causes of action, including (1) disability discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(a); (2) failure to engage in the interactive process under FEHA, Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(n); (3) failure to accommodate a disability in violation of FEHA, Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(m); (4) wrongful termination; (5) retaliation, Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(h); and (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Id.) On October 18, 2022, the Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss as to the Plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and denied it as to all Plaintiff's [*2]  other claims. (See Dkt. 40.)
Now before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment. (See Dkt. 44 [Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment, hereinafter "Mot."].) For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is GRANTED.

II. BACKGROUND
The following facts are undisputed.1 Defendant hired Plaintiff to work as a Distribution Specialist in its warehouse department starting on or around December 3, 2018. (Dkt. 45 [Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law, hereinafter "D-SUF"] ¶ 1.) In that role, he was required to walk through the 30,000 square-foot warehouse finding, packing, and shipping customer orders. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 4.) All the warehouse employees were required to lift fifty pounds and stand for most of the day. (Id. ¶ 5.) Defendant's Huntington Beach facility also has a customer service department, revenue cycle department, and pharmacy department. (Id. ¶ 7.) Defendant has a policy of providing reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities unless doing so would present an undue hardship to the company, (id. ¶ 18), and a policy of evaluating on a case-by-case basis whether further unpaid leave should be granted to a disabled employee as a form of [*3]  reasonable accommodation, (Dkt. 56 [Statement of Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes, hereinafter "P-SUF"] ¶ 65.)
After graduating high school, Plaintiff attended Pepperdine University but did not graduate. (Id. ¶ 5.) His prior job experience includes having his own process serving company in the early 2000s, (id. ¶ 4), working at an asphalt and concrete company doing project appraisals, (id. ¶ 6), and working as a warehouse employee at Home Depot, (DSUF ¶ 15).
While he was employed as a Distribution Specialist, Plaintiff's general manager was Joe Pau and his supervisor was Gonzalo Ramirez. (P-SUF ¶¶ 9, 10.) Plaintiff asserts that he started to experience hip pain within six months of starting work. (Id. ¶ 14.) During Plaintiff's first year of employment with Defendant, he submitted six separate requests for a transfer into one of the office departments due to the physical strain of lifting heavy objects all day. (Id. ¶ 13.) All of Plaintiff's requests were denied. (Id.) Plaintiff did not ask to see a doctor or "request any other accommodations until the pain became so severe that he could no longer perform his duties." (Id. ¶ 15.)
On March 29, 2021, Plaintiff's hip pain worsened, [*4]  and he asked Ramirez if he could see a doctor. (Id. ¶ 15; D-SUF ¶ 22.) Ramirez sent Plaintiff to MCMG Westminster Goldenwest Urgent Care, where medical staff took x-rays, gave Plaintiff an injection for the pain, prescribed him an anti-inflammatory, and placed him on temporary total disability until his follow-up appointment on March 31. (P-SUF ¶¶ 16, 17.) That same day, Plaintiff applied for leave through Defendant's third-party leave administrator, Cigna, which Cigna confirmed in a letter to Plaintiff dated March 29, 2021. (D-SUF ¶ 24.) Plaintiff's request was approved and effective from March 25 to June 16, 2021. (Id. ¶ 25.)
At Plaintiff's follow-up appointment on March 31, Dr. Robert Vu diagnosed Plaintiff with hip pain and osteoarthritis of the right hip. (P-SUF ¶ 19; D-SUF ¶ 26.) Dr. Vu placed Plaintiff on "sit down work only" restrictions and noted that if Defendant was not able to accommodate that restriction, Plaintiff should "be placed off work or temporary totally disabled ('TTD') until his next appointment." (D-SUF ¶¶ 26, 27.) At the next appointment on April 7, Dr. Vu found that Plaintiff's symptoms had not improved, and stated that he was to remain on sit down work only [*5]  or TTD restrictions until his next appointment. (Id. ¶ 28; P-SUF ¶ 21.) Plaintiff saw Dr. Vu again on April 14, and Dr. Vu again identified that Plaintiff's symptoms had not improved and that the same restrictions should continue to apply. (D-SUF ¶ 29.) Dr. Vu made the same finding after Plaintiff's appointment on April 21. (Id. ¶ 32.) He also stated that Plaintiff's care had been transferred to orthopedics. (Dkt. 48 [Declaration of Dara Rosen, hereinafter "Rosen Decl."] Ex. P [April 21, 2021, Physician Report].)
On April 19, Pau sent Plaintiff a text message asking for an update and reminding Plaintiff to follow up regarding his status. (D-SUF ¶ 30.) Plaintiff responded on April 23, stating that he was at a funeral and would call Pau the following week. (Id. ¶ 31.) On May 6, Pau texted Plaintiff again asking for an update on his work status. (Id. ¶ 33.) Plaintiff responded on May 7, informing Pau that he had been authorized to see a specialist. (Id. ¶ 36.)
On May 14, Plaintiff had an appointment with the orthopedic specialist, Dr. Albert Tsai. (Id. ¶ 37.) Dr. Tsai's report from that appointment indicates that he was requesting authorization for a total hip replacement surgery and recommending [*6]  the same work restrictions put in place by Dr. Vu. (Rosen Decl. Ex. Q [May 14, 2021, Primary Treating Physician's Progress Report].) Plaintiff had a follow-up appointment with Dr. Tsai on June 4, and Dr. Tsai made the same findings regarding surgery authorization and work restrictions. (Id. Ex. R [June 4, 2021 Primary Treating Physician's Progress Report].) While Plaintiff did not discuss the anticipated hip replacement surgery directly with Defendant, (P-SUF ¶ 28), after every doctor's appointment he made copies of the doctor's notes and hand delivered them to Defendant, (id. ¶ 18.)
Plaintiff received a letter from Cigna on June 9 notifying him that his FMLA/CFRA leave was going to expire on June 16. (Id. ¶ 29.) On June 11, Defendant was notified that Plaintiff's workers' compensation claim had been denied because it was determined that his need for hip replacement surgery was not work-related. (DSUF ¶ 45.)
On June 16, Pau reached out to Dara Rosen, a Senior Human Resources Generalist, (P-SUF ¶ 39), and informed her that he had not heard from Plaintiff regarding his work status, (D-SUF ¶ 48). Pau told Rosen that if Plaintiff was unable to return to work, he recommended terminating Plaintiff's [*7]  employment and "inviting him to reapply once he was ready to work." (Id. ¶ 49.) That same day, Pau called and texted Plaintiff to discuss his expected return to work the following day. (Id. ¶¶ 50, 51.) When Plaintiff did not answer Pau's call or respond to his first text message, Pau texted him again and instructed him to contact Human Resources. (Id. ¶ 52; P-SUF ¶ 30.) Plaintiff responded and asked Pau for the number for Human Resources, which Pau provided. (D-SUF ¶ 53.) Pau told Plaintiff to call him back if Plaintiff was unable to get in touch with Rosen. (Id. ¶ 55.) Plaintiff proceeded to leave three voicemails for Rosen, and in the last voicemail he requested that Rosen call him first thing in the morning if she could not talk that day. (P-SUF ¶ 31.)
On June 17, when he had not heard back from Plaintiff, Pau texted Plaintiff asking whether he spoke to Rosen and if he would be coming to work. (D-SUF ¶ 59.) Plaintiff responded that he was not coming in but that he had left a message for Rosen. (Id. ¶ 60.) Later that day, Pau and Rosen initiated a conference call with Plaintiff, during which he confirmed that he was unable to return to work. (Id. ¶ 61.) Plaintiff was informed that [*8]  his employment was being terminated. (P-SUF ¶ 33.)
Plaintiff contacted Dr. Tsai's office the following day, but he did not attempt to continue treatment with Dr. Tsai or inquire into the status of his surgery authorization. (D-SUF ¶¶ 66, 67.) And while Plaintiff's health insurance was government-sponsored—and thus not dependent on his employment with Defendant—and would have fully covered the cost of the hip replacement surgery, Plaintiff did not see another doctor about his hip until over a year later. (Id. ¶¶ 68-70.) Ultimately, Plaintiff did not receive authorization for the surgery until October 2022, sixteen months after his termination. (Id. ¶ 72.) While Plaintiff was scheduled to have the surgery on November 27, 2022, he was evicted on November 1, 2022, and was thereafter homeless. (P-SUF ¶ 37.) Because he did not have anywhere to recover, Plaintiff decided not to go forward with the surgery on the scheduled date.2 (Id.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD
The Court may grant summary judgment on "each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any [*9]  affidavits show that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Id.; see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. A factual issue is "genuine" when there is sufficient evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could resolve the issue in the nonmovant's favor. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A fact is "material" when its resolution might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. See id. "Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. at 249.
Where the movant will bear the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the movant "must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). In contrast, where the nonmovant will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the moving party may discharge its burden of production by either (1) negating an essential element of the opposing party's claim or defense, Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-60, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970), or (2) showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case, Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. Once this burden is met, the party resisting the motion must set [*10]  forth, by affidavit, or as otherwise provided under Rule 56, "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. A party opposing summary judgment must support its assertion that a material fact is genuinely disputed by (i) citing to materials in the record, (ii) showing the moving party's materials are inadequate to establish an absence of genuine dispute, or (iii) showing that the moving party lacks admissible evidence to support its factual position. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A)-(B). The opposing party may also object to the material cited by the movant on the basis that it "cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). But the opposing party must show more than the "mere existence of a scintilla of evidence"; rather, "there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [opposing party]." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court must examine all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and draw all justifiable inferences in his favor. See id.; United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962); T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987). The court does not make credibility determinations, nor does it weigh conflicting evidence. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 456, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992). But conclusory and speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is [*11]  insufficient to raise triable issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See Thornhill Publ'g Co. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979). The evidence the parties present must be admissible. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "If the court does not grant all the relief requested by the motion, it may enter an order stating any material fact—including an item of damages or other relief—that is not genuinely in dispute and treating the fact as established in the case." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(g).

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination
In evaluating claims for disability discrimination under FEHA, California has adopted the three-stage burden shifting test set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 (1973). See Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). When the employer is the party moving for summary judgment, it bears the initial burden. See Dep't of Fair Empl. & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011). To prevail, the employer must "show either that (1) [the] plaintiff could not establish one of the elements of the FEHA claim or (2) there was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the plaintiff's termination. Knight v. Air Prod. & Chems., Inc., 2021 WL 3021283, at *6 (C.D. Cal. June 21, 2021) (cleaned up). "If the employer meets its burden," the plaintiff must show "either that the defendant's showing was in fact insufficient or . . . that there was a triable issue of fact material to the defendant's showing." Id. (cleaned up).
The elements of a FEHA disability discrimination claim are "(1) [the] plaintiff [*12]  suffers from a disability; (2) [the] plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) [the] plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 254, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). Whether someone is a "qualified individual" depends on whether they can perform the essential duties of their job, with or without reasonable accommodation. See Green v. State, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 260, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007). A "reasonable accommodation" is a "modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables a disabled employee to perform the essential functions of the job" he holds. Taylor v. Trees, Inc., 58 F. Supp. 3d 1092, 1111 (E.D. Cal. 2014).
As a preliminary matter, it is undisputed that the ability to stand for most of the day and lift fifty pounds were essential functions of any job in the warehouse department, (see D-SUF ¶ 5), and that at the time of his termination, Plaintiff was not able to perform those essential functions without accommodation, (see, e.g., Rosen Decl. Ex. R [June 4, 2021 Primary Treating Physician's Progress Report] [stating that Plaintiff was limited to "sedentary work only"]). The parties' dispute therefore centers on whether a reasonable accommodation would have allowed Plaintiff to perform those essential functions. (See Mot. at 14.)
Plaintiff asserts that there were two reasonable accommodations, [*13]  either of which could have allowed him to perform the essential functions of the job: transfer to an office job, or an extended leave of absence. (See Dkt. 54 [Opposition, hereinafter "Opp."] at 17.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff was not qualified for any office job and that an indefinite leave of absence is not a "reasonable accommodation" under FEHA. (See Mot. at 14; Dkt. 58 [Reply to Plaintiff's Untimely Opposition to Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment, hereinafter "Reply"] at 6-7.)

1. Job Transfer
"[R]eassignment of disabled employees as a reasonable accommodation is not automatic," and applies only if "there exists, or soon will be, a vacant position which the employee is qualified to perform." Ransom v. Ariz. Bd. of Regents, 983 F. Supp. 895, 901 (D. Ariz. 1997). In other words, an employer has no duty to reassign a disabled employee if "there is no vacant position for which the employee is qualified." Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1389, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000). An employer is also "not required to create light-duty positions," Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1225-26, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899 (2006), nor "to exempt an employee from performing essential functions or to reallocate essential functions to other employees," Taylor, 58 F. Supp. 3d at 1112 (citing Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d at 744; Dark v. Curry County, 451 F.3d 1078, 1089 (9th Cir.2006)).
In his Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the Huntington Beach facility "is handicap accessible and ADA compliant" and that Defendant [*14]  "employed customer service representatives and revenue cycle employees who primarily performed sedentary work." (Opp. at 17 [citations omitted].) Plaintiff asserts that "[his] request for a less physically demanding role" was thus "in line with the available positions within the company," and yet "[d]espite these facts, no accommodations were offered, and no efforts were made to modify his job duties or provide him with alternative positions that would meet his medical requirements." (Id. [citations omitted].)
While it is true that during his first year of employment Plaintiff repeatedly requested (and was denied) a transfer into an office position, (P-SUF ¶ 13), there is no evidence in the record that Plaintiff ever requested a transfer after he became disabled in March 2021. On the contrary, Plaintiff testified that from his perspective, by June 2021 the only appropriate accommodation Defendant could have offered him was an extended leave of absence. (See Dkt. 47 [Declaration of Lindsay Ryan] Ex. A [January 19, 2023 Deposition of Scott Filipek, hereinafter "Filipek Dep."] 98:5-10.)
Importantly, other than general averments to the availability of office jobs, nowhere in his Opposition [*15]  does Plaintiff identify a specific position that he was qualified for and that was vacant at the time of his termination. And for its part, Defendant has put forth evidence indicating that Plaintiff was not qualified for any of the non-warehouse positions at the Huntington Beach facility. Employees in the customer service department are required to have "at least 1-2 years of customer service experience, and call center experience is preferred." (D-SUF ¶ 9.) Employees in the revenue cycle department "must possess knowledge of medical terminology and healthcare billing code systems (HCPC/IC-9), and at least one (1) year of medical collections/billing work experience is preferred." (Id. ¶ 11.) Finally, non-managerial employees in the pharmacy department must have "a Resident State Pharmacy Technician License (CPhT), issued by the State of California." (Id. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff testified that he had experience "speak[ing] with customers and inform[ing] them of the options they have," (Filipek Dep. 46:15-16), but admitted that he had no experience working a customer hotline, (see id. 46:11-13). Plaintiff also has not claimed to have knowledge of healthcare billing code systems, or to possess [*16]  a CPhT issued by the State of California.

2. Leave of Absence
A leave of absence can constitute a reasonable accommodation "where it appears likely that the employee will be able to return to an existing position at some time in the foreseeable future." Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 263. In evaluating the reasonableness of a leave of absence, California courts consider whether the leave would have been "a finite leave of absence" or an "indefinite" one. Atkins v. City of Los Angeles, 8 Cal. App. 5th 696, 721-22, 214 Cal. Rptr. 3d 113 (2017). "[A] finite leave can be a reasonable accommodation . . ., provided it is likely that at the end of the leave, the employee would be able to perform his or her duties." Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). On the other hand, "a leave of absence of undefined length is not a reasonable accommodation." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 377-78, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015); see also Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 226 ("Reasonable accommodation does not require the employer to wait indefinitely for an employee's medical condition to be corrected." (citation omitted)).
Courts in this Circuit routinely find that "if the employer does not know when the employee will be able to return to duty, the employer is not required to grant" the employee indefinite leave. Norris v. Allied-Sysco Food Servs., Inc., 948 F. Supp. 1418, 1439 (N.D. Cal.1996) (collecting cases), aff'd sub nom. Norris v. Sysco Corp., 191 F.3d 1043 (9th Cir. 1999); see Tipton v. Airport Terminal Servs. Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131828, 2020 WL 3980127, at *7-8 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2020) (finding that leave extension would have been indefinite—and thus unreasonable—because plaintiff "informed [her [*17]  employer] that she did not know when she would be able to return to work . . . and she did not know when she would obtain treatment for her injured shoulder"); Lara v. DNC Parks & Resorts at Tenaya, Inc., 2015 WL 4394618, at *14-15 (E.D. Cal. July 16, 2015) (determining that extension of plaintiff's leave would not have been a reasonable accommodation because plaintiff's doctor "had not cleared her to work" and she "had no expected time-frame within which she expected to be able to return to work"); Yates v. Health Servs. Advisory Grp. Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118178, 2017 WL 3197228, at *8 (C.D. Cal. July 24, 2017) (explaining that additional leave was not a reasonable accommodation when "plaintiff could not provide an anticipated date for her return, plaintiff's doctors continued to diagnose her as temporarily totally disabled, and plaintiff's doctor did not release her for work until a year after her termination"); Pratt v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 2015 WL 2153397, at *10 (C.D. Cal. May 4, 2015) (rejecting leave of absence as a reasonable accommodation under FEHA because plaintiff "could not articulate 'when and under what conditions he could return to work at all'" (citation omitted)). Even if a plaintiff cannot provide a definite date for his return, he must at least present some evidence "to show that any leave of absence would have enabled him to regularly attend to his essential duties." Neufeld v. WinCo Holdings, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26335, 2016 WL 815649, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2016), aff'd, 699 F. App'x 659 (9th Cir. 2017).
According to Defendant, any further leave of absence after the expiration [*18]  of Plaintiff's FMLA leave would have been of an indefinite duration because Plaintiff's hip surgery "was neither approved nor scheduled." (Mot. at 14.) It is undisputed that at the time of his termination (1) Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of the Distribution Specialist position without some form of accommodation, (2) Plaintiff's condition had not improved over the two and a half months he spent on FMLA leave, (see D-SUF ¶¶ 28, 29, 32), and (3) Plaintiff did not know when his hip replacement surgery would be authorized or scheduled, (see Filipek Dep. 127:1-6). Moreover, nowhere in his Opposition does Plaintiff provide any estimate of how much more leave would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his job.
In sum, Plaintiff did not know when he would be able to perform the essential functions of the Distribution Specialist position, and Defendant was not required to provide him with indefinite leave in the meantime. See Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 226-27; Canupp v. Children's Receiving Home of Sacramento, 181 F. Supp. 3d 767, 777-78 (E.D. Cal. 2016) (holding that "the undisputed evidence shows that the duration of any leave of absence at the time of plaintiff's termination would have been indefinite," and thus "plaintiff cannot show that any additional leave would have [*19]  been a reasonable accommodation under FEHA"). Because Plaintiff has not demonstrated that there was any reasonable accommodation that would have allowed him to perform the essential functions of the job, there is no triable issue of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff was a qualified individual under FEHA.

B. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation for his disability in violation of California Government Code § 12940(m). "The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal. Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "Two principles underlie a cause of action for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874, 890 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006). "First, the employee must request an accommodation." Id. "Second, the parties must engage in an interactive process regarding the requested accommodation and, if the process fails, responsibility for the failure rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith." Id. "While a claim of failure to accommodate is independent of a cause of action for failure [*20]  to engage in an interactive dialogue, each necessarily implicates the other." Id.
Here, Plaintiff's "failure to accommodate claim is unavailing because," as previously discussed, "[he] was not a qualified individual." Markowitz v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 711 F. App'x 430, 431 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Cuiellette v. City of L.A., 194 Cal. App. 4th 757, 766, 123 Cal. Rptr. 3d 562 (2011)); see Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 977, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (holding that an "employee's ability to perform the essential functions of a job is a prerequisite to liability" for failure to accommodate); Chisolm v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 814 F. App'x 194, 197 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding that plaintiff's FEHA disability discrimination claim and FEHA reasonable accommodation claim failed for the same reasons).

C. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Plaintiff further asserts that Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process in violation of Government Code § 12940(n). Pursuant to Section 12940(n), an employer is required "to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . with a known physical . . . disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). While an employee "cannot necessarily be expected to identify and request all possible accommodations during the interactive process itself," "once the parties have engaged in the litigation process," to survive summary judgment, "the employee must be able to identify an available accommodation the interactive process should have produced." Scotch, 173 Cal. Appl. 4th at 1018. As a result, [*21]  "the employee who brings a [S]ection 12940(n) claim bears the burden of proving a reasonable accommodation was available before the employer can be held liable under the statute." Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 984.
Plaintiff has not identified a reasonable accommodation that would have been available if Defendant had engaged in the interactive process. As a result, he has not established that there is a dispute of fact regarding whether Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process.

D. Retaliation
"To assert a prima facie claim for retaliation under FEHA, Plaintiff must plead that: (1) [he] engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected [him] to an 'adverse employment action,' and (3) there is a 'causal link' between the protected activity and the employer's action." Hicks v. Netflix, Inc., 472 F. Supp. 3d 763, 771 (C.D. Cal. Jul. 15, 2020) (quoting Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). The McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis applies to claims for retaliation under FEHA. See Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042. Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not put forth evidence suggesting that Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his termination was pretext. (See Mot. at 22-23; Reply at 8.)
First, an employee who requests an accommodation is engaged in a protected activity under FEHA. See Abel Lugo v. Performance Transp., LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228462, 2020 WL 7034336, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2020) ("[R]equesting a disability accommodation qualifies as a protected activity [*22]  for FEHA purposes."); Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 243, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016) ("A term of leave from work can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA and, therefore, a request for leave can be considered to be a request for accommodation under FEHA.").
The next step in the analysis asks whether Defendant had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for firing Plaintiff. "[T]he employer's burden is satisfied if he simply explains what he has done or produces evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons." Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981) (cleaned up). In Lawler v. Montblanc North America, LLC, 704 F.3d 1235 (2013), the Ninth Circuit held that an employee's inability to perform the essential functions of his job was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his termination. See id. at 1243-44 (citing Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746 (recognizing an employer's inability-to-perform defense as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating a cable installer's employment); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 7293.8(b)). Here, Defendant has asserted that Plaintiff was terminated because he could not perform the essential functions of the Distribution Specialist position. Because Defendant's stated reason for Plaintiff's termination is "facially unrelated to prohibited bias," Guz, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 358, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to put forth evidence that Defendant's proffered reason for his termination was pretext for unlawful [*23]  retaliation.
Plaintiff has not carried his burden. "A plaintiff must offer 'specific' and 'substantial' circumstantial evidence to prove pretext in a retaliation claim under FEHA." Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1244-45 (quoting Winarto v. Toshiba Am. Elecs. Components, Inc., 274 F.3d 1276, 1284 (9th Cir. 2001)). The only evidence of retaliation put forth by Plaintiff is (1) the "temporal proximity" between his request for medical leave and his termination, and (2) the fact that during their depositions, Rosen and Pau stated that they did not know why Plaintiff was fired, which "suggests that the termination was not based on legitimate business reasons." (Opp. at 20.)
Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, however, Rosen testified that Plaintiff was terminated because he was unable to return to work after his FMLA leave expired. (See Dkt. 55-2 [Exhibit 2 - Depo of Dara Rosen] 87:4-22.) In the testimony Plaintiff cites from Rosen's deposition, Rosen was addressing whether she personally knew why Pau and Ramirez decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment. (See id. 72:4-15.) And in the testimony cited from Pau's deposition, Pau's lawyer objected to a question asking why Plaintiff was fired, stating that Pau was not responding on behalf of the company and informing Pau that he could respond if he personally knew. [*24]  In response, Plaintiff stated "I - - I don't know the exact reason." (Dkt. 55-3 Ex. 3 [March 2, 2023 Deposition of Joe Pau] 77:6-14.) Plaintiff does not dispute that the day before his termination, Pau informed Rosen that if Plaintiff was unable to return to work, Pau recommended terminating Plaintiff's employment. (See D-SUF ¶ 49.) Additionally, "temporal proximity alone is not sufficient to raise a triable issue as to pretext once the employer has offered evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the termination." Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 353, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008).
Because Plaintiff has failed to put forth specific or substantial circumstantial evidence showing that Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason was pretext for retaliation, there is no dispute of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff's termination was in retaliation for engaging in a protected activity.

E. Wrongful Termination
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy necessarily fails because it is derivative of his FEHA discrimination and retaliation claims. (See Mot. at 21.) As discussed above, there is no dispute of material fact precluding summary judgment on Plaintiff's discrimination and [*25]  retaliation claims. Accordingly, Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim premised on the same conduct also fails. See Husman v. Toyota Motor Credit Corp., 12 Cal. App. 5th 1168, 1192 n.13, 220 Cal. Rptr. 3d 42 (2017) (reversing summary adjudication of wrongful termination claim as a consequence of reversal of FEHA discrimination claim, where both claims were "grounded in the same conduct"); Shinde v. Coffman Eng'rs, Inc., 584 F. App'x 398, 399 (9th Cir. 2014) (explaining that court properly granted summary judgment on plaintiff's wrongful termination claim, "which was premised on the alleged violation of the anti-discrimination policy embodied in the FEHA, for the same reasons" it granted summary judgment on his FEHA claims); Neufeld v. WinCo Holdings, Inc., 699 F. App'x 659, 660 (9th Cir. 2017) (affirming summary judgment on "common law claim for wrongful termination . . . because it was derivative of [the plaintiff's] FEHA claims" on which summary judgment was properly granted).

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
