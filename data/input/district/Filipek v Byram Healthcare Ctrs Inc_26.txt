ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND [Dkt. 30]

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Scott Filipek filed this action against Defendants Byram Healthcare Centers, Inc. and unnamed Does in Orange County Superior Court. (Dkt. 1-2 [State Court Complaint].) Plaintiff alleged six causes of action against Defendants, including: (1) disability discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(a); (2) failure to engage in the interactive process under FEHA, Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(n); (3) failure to accommodate a disability in violation of FEHA, Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(m); (4) wrongful termination; (5) retaliation, Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(h); and (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Id.)
On March 28, 2022, the Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss with leave to amend. (See Dkt. 22 [Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss with Leave to Amend, [*2]  hereinafter "Order"].) Plaintiff subsequently filed its First Amended Complaint. (See Dkt. 25.) Shortly after, Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint ("SAC"). (See Dkt. 27 [hereinafter, "SAC"].) The SAC contains the same causes of action alleged in the State Court Complaint.
Now before the Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's SAC. (See Dkt. 30 [Notice of Motion and Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, hereinafter "Mot."].) For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.1

II. BACKGROUND
Defendant hired Plaintiff to work in its warehouse department on or around September 20, 2017. (Compl. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff alleges that he began suffering from hip pain in 2019 due to the repetitive duties he performed during his employment, such as "lifting heavy boxes." (Id. ¶ 9.) On March 24, 2021, Plaintiff's hip pain worsened significantly, to the point where it became difficult for him to walk. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that he reported this pain to his Supervisor, Gonzalo (whose last name is unknown) and to Joe Pau, Defendant's General Manager. (Id.) On March 29, 2021, Plaintiff's hip pain intensified further, prompting Gonzalo [*3]  to send Plaintiff to urgent care. (Id. ¶ 10.) There, Plaintiff was given a doctor's note stating that he should not work until March 31, 2021, at which point he would be re-evaluated. (Id.)
Plaintiff's visits to the doctor continued. On March 31, 2021, the doctor examined Plaintiff again and wrote a note stating that Plaintiff's symptoms had not significantly improved and that he be restricted to "sit down work only". (Id. ¶ 11.) Plaintiff took the note in person to Gonzalo, who made a copy. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that he visited the doctor again on April 7, 2021, April 14, 2021, April 21, 2021, May 14, 2021, and June 4, 2021. (Id. ¶¶ 12-15.) At each visit, Plaintiff was given a doctor's note containing work restrictions. The June 4, 2021, note requested authorization for total right hip replacement surgery. (Id. ¶ 15.) Plaintiff alleges that he provided copies of each note to Gonzalo. (Id.)
Plaintiff remained on leave until June 2021. On June 9, 2021, he received a letter from Cigna explaining that he had exhausted his Medical Leave. (Id. ¶ 16.) On June 16, 2021, General Manager Joe Pau sent Plaintiff a text stating, "Just going to try one last time. Please call HR or me today to talk [*4]  about returning to work tomorrow. I can get us both in a call with HR." (Id. ¶ 17.) Plaintiff alleges that he reached out to HR and arranged a call for June 18, 2021, which he believed would be to discuss "modified duties so he could go back to work." (Id. ¶ 18.) Plaintiff, Joe Pau, and Dora Rosen2 attended the conference call. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that during the call, he was informed that his employment was terminated. (Id.) He was also given a letter stating the same, dated June 18, 2021. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that he was "fired due to his work-related injury, the hip surgery, and the required accommodations for said injury and surgery" and for sustaining and reporting a work-related injury. (Id. ¶ 19.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of a plaintiff's claims. The issue on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the plaintiff is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims asserted. Gilligan v. Jamco Dev. Corp., 108 F.3d 246, 249 (9th Cir. 1997). Rule 12(b)(6) is read in conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires only "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).
For [*5]  a plaintiff to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations to "state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). When evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the district court must accept all material allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Skilstaf, Inc. v. CVS Caremark Corp., 669 F.3d 1005, 1014 (9th Cir. 2012). However, the court is "not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation." Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Count 1 — Disability Discrimination Under FEHA
"FEHA . . . requires a plaintiff to plausibly allege the following in order to state a prima facie claim of disability discrimination: '(1) plaintiff suffers from a disability; (2) plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability.'" Ravel v. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Inc., 228 F. Supp. 3d 1086, 1095 (quoting Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 254, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000)). Defendant argues that Plaintiff is unable to satisfy the second and third elements of his disability discrimination claim. The Court disagrees.

1. Plaintiff Sufficiently Alleges That He Suffers From A Disability.
Plaintiff has alleged that he was unable to lift heavy boxes and struggled to walk as a result of his hip pain. (See SAC ¶¶ 22, 30.) This is sufficient to [*6]  allege that he suffers from a physical disability under FEHA. Indeed, the parties do not dispute that Plaintiff suffers from a qualifying disability. (See Mot. at 7; see also Order at 4-7.)

2. Plaintiff Plausibly Alleges That He is a Qualified Individual Under FEHA.
Under FEHA, whether someone is a "qualified individual" depends on whether they can perform the essential duties of their job, with or without reasonable accommodation. See Green v. State, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 260, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007). A "reasonable accommodation" is a "modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables a disabled employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Taylor v. Trees, Inc., 58 F.Supp.3d 1092, 1111 (E.D. Cal. 2014). Therefore, to establish that he was a qualified individual, Plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to allege that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job with or without a reasonable accommodation.
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that he is a qualified individual under FEHA. Specifically, he alleges that he "would have been able to perform the essential duties of his position if" Defendant (1) had given him "the needed medical leave to recuperate from surgery," or (2) had "provid[ed] him with assistance in lifting heavy boxes," which was part of his job in [*7]  the Warehouse Department. (SAC ¶ 49.) These are the types of reasonable accommodations that can help a plaintiff perform the essential functions of a job. "Where a leave of absence would reasonably accommodate an employee's disability and permit him, upon his return, to perform the essential functions of the job, that employee" may be a qualified individual under FEHA.3 Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1135-36 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Nunes v. Wal—Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir.1999)); see also Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000) ("Holding a job open for a disabled employee who needs time to recuperate or heal is in itself a form of reasonable accommodation.") "Reasonable accommodations" under FEHA may also include job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, and acquisition or modification of equipment or devices. See Scotch v. Art Institute of California Orange County, Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1010, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009); see also Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(o); 2 Cal. Code Reg. § 7293.9(a).
Defendant contends that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual because the result of any further leave of absence was speculative and granting Plaintiff indefinite leave would not be a "reasonable accommodation" that would have allowed him to perform the essential duties of his job in the foreseeable future. But a plaintiff is not required "to show that a leave of absence is certain or even likely to be successful to prove that it is a reasonable [*8]  accommodation." Humphrey, 239 F. 3d at 1136. And the likely length and reasonableness of Plaintiff's requested leave is a factual question that cannot be determined at the pleading stage.4 All that matters at the pleading stage is if the plaintiff has "alleged" sufficient facts to show he could have performed the duties of his position if his employer had made a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff has done so here.

3. Plaintiff Plausibly Alleges That He Was Terminated Because Of His Disability.
Finally, Plaintiff must allege "actions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if such actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a [prohibited] discriminatory criterion." Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 355, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). An "employee need only offer sufficient circumstantial evidence to give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination." McInteer v. Ashley Distribution Servs., Ltd., 40 F. Supp. 3d 1269, 1281-82 (C.D. Cal. 2014); see also id. at 1281 (finding prima facia case that plaintiff was terminated because of his disability based on "the coincidence in timing between his medical leave and termination"); Maxwell v. Verde Valley Ambulance Co. Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127370, 2014 WL 4470512, *9 (D. Ariz. Sept. 11, 2014) (finding prima facia case that plaintiff was terminated because of his disability where "Plaintiff disclosed his disability and requested an accommodation on May 16, 2011, and he was terminated two weeks [*9]  later").
The SAC contains facts sufficient to allege that Plaintiff's termination was connected to his disability. Plaintiff was fired two days after the expiration of his leave, and less than two weeks after requesting accommodation in the form of extended leave or modified work duties. The SAC also alleges that Plaintiff was in regular communication with Defendant regarding his condition. The text message sent by Defendant's General Manager on June 16, 2021, implied that Defendant had tried (unsuccessfully) to reach out to Plaintiff more than once to discuss his return. (See SAC ¶ 14 ["Just going to try one last time. Please call HR or me today to talk about returning to work tomorrow. I can get us both in a call with HR."].) But Plaintiff alleges that given his frequent communication with Defendant, the text "seemed strange" and "was written with an intent to create an excuse or pretense to fire him right after the exhaustion of his medical leave." (Id. ¶ 17.) This allegation, combined with the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's termination and his request for further leave or modified work duties, is sufficient to allege that Plaintiff was terminated as a result of his disability. [*10] 5

B. Count 2 — Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Count Two of the SAC alleges that Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process in violation of California Government Code section 12940(n). Under Section 12940(n), "It is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." The interactive process required by FEHA is "an informal process with the employee . . . to attempt to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013.
Once an employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation, that employer has a mandatory obligation to engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify and implement reasonable accommodations. See Barnett v. U.S. Air, 228 F.3d 1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 800 (N.D. Cal. 2015) ("FEHA imposes on employers a mandatory obligation to engage in the interactive process once an employee requests an accommodation for his or her disability, or when the employer itself [*11]  recognizes the need for one."). Simply rejecting a requested accommodation, without exploring the possibility of other reasonable accommodations, "constitutes a violation of [the employer's] duty regarding the mandatory interactive process." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139. An employer's obligation to engage in the interactive process also "extends beyond the first attempt at accommodation and continues when the employee asks for a different accommodation or where the employer is aware that the initial accommodation is failing and further accommodation is needed." Id.
Plaintiff's SAC plausibly states a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process. Plaintiff alleges that he gave Defendant a doctor's note on June 4, 2021, stating that he needed either modified work duties or an extended leave of absence. Receiving a doctor's note informing the employer of an employee's disability is sufficient to trigger the employer's obligation to initiate the interactive process. See, e.g., Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1138. But Plaintiff alleges that "rather than engaging in discussions with [him] regarding further accommodations for his surgery and extended leave," Defendant simply terminated his employment. (SAC ¶ 30.) This suffices to plausibly allege [*12]  a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process.

C. Count 3 — Failure to Accommodate
Count Three of the SAC alleges that Defendant failed to provide reasonable accommodations under California Government Code section 12940(m). Section 12940(m) states that "[i]t is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer . . . to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee . . . ." To state a claim for failure to accommodate in violation of section 12940(m), a plaintiff must establish that (1) he has a disability under FEHA, (2) he is qualified to perform the essential functions of his position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1009-10.6 "As long as a reasonable accommodation available to the employer could have plausibly enabled a handicapped employee to adequately perform his job, an employer is liable for failing to attempt that accommodation." Kimbro v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 889 F.2d 869, 879 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 814, 111 S. Ct. 53, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990).
Defendant alleges that the Count Three must be dismissed because Plaintiff fails to identify a reasonable accommodation that he could have been granted. (See Mot. at 10-11.) But as previously discussed, Plaintiff identified reasonable accommodations in the form of either an extended leave of absence [*13]  or modified work duties. (See SAC ¶ 49.) Plaintiff has thus alleged the existence of reasonable accommodations that could have been made available to him at the time, which Defendant failed to offer. That is sufficient at this stage of the proceedings.

D. Count 5 — Retaliation
"To assert a prima facie claim for retaliation under FEHA, Plaintiff must plead that: (1) she engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected her to an 'adverse employment action,' and (3) there is a 'causal link' between the protected activity and the employer's action." Hicks v. Netflix, Inc., 472 F. Supp. 3d 763, 771 (C.D. Cal. Jul. 15, 2020) (quoting Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). A "causal link may be established by an inference derived from circumstantial evidence, such as the employer's knowledge that the employee engaged in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected action and allegedly retaliatory employment decision." Morgan v. Regents of University of Cal., 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 70, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652, (2001).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege that he engaged in a protected activity. (See Mot. at 14.) But requesting an extended leave is a protected activity under FEHA. See Moore v. Regents of Univ. of California, 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 243, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016) ("A term of leave from work can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA and, therefore, a request for leave can be considered to be a request for accommodation under [*14]  FEHA.") (internal citations omitted). Plaintiff alleges that by handing his manager a doctor's note stating that he needed either modified work or extended leave, he was making a request to Defendant for accommodation in the form of either modified work or extended leave. (See SAC ¶ 59.) Taking all the allegations in the SAC together and granting all inferences in Plaintiff's favor, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that he engaged in the protected activity of requesting leave from his employer. And as discussed, the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's termination and his request for further leave is sufficient circumstantial evidence to allege a causal link between his protected activity and Defendant's action.

E. Count 6 — Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
"The elements of a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant, (2) intention to cause or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress, (3) severe emotional suffering and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress." Wong v. Jing, 189 Cal. App. 4th 1354, 1376, 117 Cal. Rptr. 3d 747 (2010).
As explained in the Court's prior order, Plaintiff's claim for IIED is barred by California's workers' [*15]  compensation exclusive remedy rule. See Langevin v. Federal Exp. Corp., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27861, 2015 WL 1006367, *9 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 6, 2015). The exclusive remedy rule is found in California's Workers Compensation Act ("WCA"). Cal. Labor Code § 3602. The WCA provides that when an individual complains of misconduct attributed to the employer which consists of "actions which are a normal part of the employment relationship, such as demotions, promotions, criticisms of work practices, and frictions in negotiations as to grievances, an employee suffering emotional distress causing disability may not avoid the exclusive remedy provisions of the Labor Code by characterizing the employer's decisions as manifestly unfair, outrageous, harassment, or intended to cause emotional disturbance resulting in disability." Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection District, 43 Cal.3d 148, 160, 233 Cal. Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743 (1987). "California courts have held that California IIED claims are barred by the WCA's exclusivity provisions, even if they are based on conduct that allegedly violates a fundamental public policy." Langevin, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27861, 2015 WL 1006367 at *10 (collecting cases); see also Carlos v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., 726 F. App'x 576, 579 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding IIED claim barred by WCA because discriminatory termination is "a normal part of the employment relationship, and the workers' compensation bargain encompasses disability arising from such actions"). Because Plaintiff's IIED claim is based entirely on his allegedly discriminatory [*16]  termination, it is barred by the WCA.
But even if Plaintiff's IIED claim was not barred by the WCA, "to mount a successful intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, the defendant's conduct must be so extreme and outrageous as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community." Fazaei v. Macy's Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49965, 2022 WL 834950, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 21, 2022) (cleaned up). Both state and federal courts have held that "[t]erminating an employee for improper or discriminatory reasons, like many other adverse personnel management decisions, is insufficiently extreme or outrageous to give rise to a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress." Walker v. Boeing Corp., 218 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1190 (C.D. Cal. 2002); see also Kasperzyk v. Shelter Security Servs., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, 2015 WL 1348503, *12 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2015) ("At least in the absence of some extraordinary circumstances, a claim of employment discrimination [in violation of FEHA] does not, in itself, give rise to an IIED claim."). Because Plaintiff has not alleged any conduct beyond his termination in violation of FEHA, he has failed to allege conduct that is sufficiently outrageous or extraordinary to make a claim for IIED.7

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's IIED claim and DENIED as to all other claims.
