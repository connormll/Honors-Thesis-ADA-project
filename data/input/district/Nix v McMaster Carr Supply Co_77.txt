Opinion



ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff April Nix filed the above-styled employment discrimination action against Defendant McMaster Carr Supply Co. ("McMaster-Carr"), on July 24, 2017. [Doc. 1]. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq., by interfering with her right to FMLA leave. [Id., Count One]. Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant subjected her to discrimination on the basis of her disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., by failing to provide her with a reasonable accommodation and terminating her employment. [Id., Count Two]. Both Plaintiff and Defendant have moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 on Plaintiff's [*2]  claims based upon the pleadings, statements of material facts, exhibits, and discovery materials submitted to the court. [Docs. 40, 50].

I. Preliminary Issues
Also pending before the court are a motion [Doc. 61] to strike filed by Defendant and a motion [Doc. 72] to supplement the record filed by Plaintiff. Defendant moves to strike the declarations of Tatiana Molette, Jua26kn Wharton, Rob Woods, and Dr. Shane Mangrum or, in the alternative, to take their depositions. [Doc. 61]. Defendant has also filed a contemporaneous notice [Doc. 62] of objection to these declarations and to other evidence provided by Plaintiff. In addition, Plaintiff has filed a notice [Doc. 57] of objection to the declarations of Joel Maxwell, Megan Puig, Amy Madere, Patrick McKenna, and Allison Thomas. The court turns first to Defendant's motion [Doc. 61] to strike.
Motions to strike are provided for by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). But the rule explicitly states that the object being stricken must be in a "pleading." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) (amended 2009). In the present case, because the declarations filed by Plaintiff are not pleadings as defined by Rule 7(a), Defendant's motion to strike is improper and must be denied. See Sum of $66,839.59 Filed in Registry of Court v. I.R.S., 119 F. Supp. 2d 1358, 1359 n.1 (N.D. Ga. 2000) ("With respect to the IRS' motion to strike, [*3]  because a motion to strike is only appropriate with regard to a pleading and an affidavit is not a pleading (see Fed. R. Civ. P. 7), the motion to strike Calloway's affidavit is procedurally improper."); 2 Moore's Federal Practice, § 12.37[2] (Matthew Bender 3d ed.) ("Motions, briefs or memoranda, objections, or affidavits may not be attacked by the motion to strike.").
The merits of Defendant's arguments are also lacking. Defendant contends that Plaintiff Nix did not properly disclose the declarants in discovery, and, therefore, the declarations from Molette, Wharton, Woods, and Mangrum should not be considered. [Docs. 61, 62]. In the alternative, "Defendant requests a reasonable time period to depose Molette, Wharton, Woods and Dr. Mangrum to establish lack of foundation and other deficiencies in their declarations, and leave to file within a reasonable time period after completion of those depositions a supplemental response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, and supplemental reply in support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment." [Doc. 61 at 9-10]. Defendant's arguments are based on, inter alia, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26. [Doc. 61 at 1].
Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(i) requires a party to disclose the names (and, if known, the addresses and telephone numbers) "of each individual [*4]  likely to have discoverable information-along with the subjects of that information-that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment[.]" See also Local Rule 26.1A, N.D. Ga. Rule 26(e) requires timely supplementation of disclosures and responses to discovery, including identities of individuals with relevant information. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e); see also Local Rule 26.1C, N.D. Ga. ("The duties of a party to supplement and amend prior initial, expert or pretrial disclosure are set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)."). Rule 37(c)(1) provides, in pertinent part: "If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or 26(e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless." Defendant, therefore, must show that Plaintiff failed to disclose information required by Rule 26(a) or 26(e). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). The undersigned concludes that Defendant has failed to make this showing.
Rule 26(e)(1)(A) provides that a party must supplement or correct its disclosures "in a timely manner." However, the requirement of Rule 26(e)(1) only applies "if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties [*5]  during the discovery process or in writing[.]" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(A). The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 26(e) provide that there is "no obligation to provide supplemental or corrective information that has been otherwise made known to the parties in writing or during the discovery process, as when a witness not previously disclosed is identified during the taking of a deposition. . . ." Professors Wright and Miller explain that this provision "recognize[s] that there is no need as a matter of form to submit a supplemental disclosure to include information already revealed by a witness in a deposition or otherwise through formal discovery." 8 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2049.1. Plaintiff asserts, and Defendant makes no argument to the contrary, that the declarants were disclosed during discovery. Woods and Mangrum were identified by Plaintiff on October 25 and November 22, 2017, and Molette and Wharton were identified by Defendant on its own list of potential comparators. [Doc. 61-4 at 4; Doc. 69-1 at 4; Doc. 69-2 at 2, 3]. Furthermore, as Defendant acknowledges, Plaintiff produced the declaration of Mangrum during discovery in mid-March 2018, and she produced the declarations [*6]  of Molette, Wharton, and Woods during discovery on April 16, 2018. [Doc. 61 at 2]. Defendant has failed to show that Plaintiff did not properly disclose the declarants.
Even assuming that Plaintiff somehow acted improperly in disclosing the declarants, and even if Defendant's motion to strike were procedurally proper, the court would nevertheless deny Defendant's motion because it was filed in contradiction to this court's discovery guidelines. In its "Guidelines for Discovery and Motion Practice" issued to the parties on September 18, 2017, this court wrote, "Counsel or pro se litigants are required to confer, by telephone or in person, in good faith before bringing a discovery dispute to the court." [Doc. 9 at 11]. The guidelines also stated, "If counsel or pro se litigants are unable to informally resolve the discovery dispute, they should arrange a telephone conference with the court through the court's judicial assistant or courtroom deputy." [Id. at 12]. Finally, the discovery guidelines stated, "Motions to compel or for a protective order, or for any related matters pertaining to discovery, should not be filed without a prior conference with the court." [Id. (emphasis in original)]. The [*7]  court put these requirements in place because litigation disputes, especially those regarding discovery, are resolved more efficiently when the parties and their lawyers cooperate. As emphasized by the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, "Effective advocacy is consistent with—and indeed depends upon—cooperative and proportional use of procedure." Fed. R. Civ. P. 1, 2015 Advisory Committee Notes.
In the present case, according to Defendant, Plaintiff waited until mid-March 2018 and April 16, 2018, at the end of the extended discovery period, to produce the declarations of witnesses who had been previously identified. [Doc. 61 at 2]. Per the discovery guidelines issued by the court, Defendant was required to confer with Plaintiff to resolve the discovery dispute. If the dispute could not be resolved informally, then Defendant was required to arrange a telephone conference with the court. [Doc. 9 at 12]. Defendant also could have notified the court of what was happening in the litigation. Instead of resolving the discovery dispute informally or contacting the court, Defendant filed the present motion [Doc. 61] to strike. Inexplicably, not only did Defendant fail to resolve the dispute informally, Defendant waited [*8]  until June 6, 2018, to file the motion. This was more than seven weeks after Plaintiff produced the declarations about which Defendant complains. [Id.]. For all these reasons, Defendant's motion [Doc. 61] to strike is DENIED.
Defendant has filed a notice of objection to the declarations of Robert Woods, Tatiana Molette, Juan Wharton, and Dr. Shane Mangrum. [Doc. 62]. Defendant also objects to the depositions of Mercer Harrington, Cedric Halliburton, Charles Harper, Stenson English, Trent Payne, and Dr. Matthew Marchal. [Id.]. Likewise, Plaintiff has filed a notice of objection to the declarations of Joel Maxwell, Megan Puig, Amy Madere, Patrick McKenna, and Allison Thomas. [Doc. 57]. The court will not evaluate each statement made within the nine declarations and six depositions that form the basis of the parties' notices of objection. Both Defendant and Plaintiff are correct that many of the assertions offered by the witnesses should not be considered by the court because they consist of hearsay, speculation, legal conclusions, or statements lacking in foundation and/or personal knowledge. To the extent that the above-cited witnesses have offered testimony that is not based on personal [*9]  knowledge, lacks foundation, amounts to hypothetical speculation or improper expert opinion, or constitutes hearsay or legal conclusion, the court will not consider the testimony in addressing the parties' summary judgment motions.
Plaintiff also objects to portions of the declarations of Joel Maxwell and Megan Puig because they are allegedly "sham" statements. [Doc. 57 at 3-10]. Maxwell is the Human Resources Director for Defendant McMaster-Carr's Atlanta facility. [Rule 30(b)(6) Deposition (Joel Maxwell) "Maxwell 30(b)(6) Dep." at 7]. At the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of Maxwell on May 22, 2017, he was asked and testified to the following about his meeting with Plaintiff on October 13, 2016, when he informed Plaintiff that her employment was terminated:
Q. And in the — on the meeting on the 13th, did [Plaintiff] ask if she could just have additional time with her FMLA leave, additional time off?
A. No, she didn't. . . .
Q. Did the company consider additional FMLA leave time for her before it fired her?
A. So . . . the company responds to—responds to the requests of employees and responds to the guidance of doctors. And so the company isn't asking someone, the company is responding to what an individual is saying [*10]  or what a doctor is saying.
Q. I don't think you've answered my question, sir, you've answered a different question. My question is, did the company consider granting additional FMLA leave time to her before it fired her?
A. If April had asked for additional FMLA time, the company would have responded.
Q. And how would the company have responded? . . .
A. If that was—I mean, if that was—if that was what was described by a doctor and abided by the, you know, by the, by the Family Medical Leave Act, then —
Q. Well, she had been approved for the FMLA, right?
A. Yes, yes.
Q. And she had additional leave left all the way through March of 2017, right?
A. Yes. The company would have, if April had described the need for a leave, the company would have granted additional FMLA leave.
[Maxwell 30(b)(6) Dep. at 102-04].1
Although Maxwell testified during his deposition that Plaintiff did not ask "if she could . . . have additional time with her FMLA leave, additional time off," Maxwell stated in his declaration that, after Plaintiff was informed of her termination, she "asked about light duty tasks or more time off." [Maxwell 30(b)(6) Dep. at 102; Maxwell Dec. ¶ 65]. In addition, Maxwell testified during [*11]  his deposition that "the company would have granted [Plaintiff] additional FMLA leave" if she "had described the need" for such leave, but Maxwell stated in his declaration that no more time off would have been granted Plaintiff regardless of whether he perceived her request as a request for FMLA leave or non-FMLA leave. [Maxwell 30(b)(6) Dep. at 102-04; Maxwell Dec. ¶ 68]. Maxwell testified in his declaration that he told Plaintiff during the termination meeting that more time off was not an option because her work restrictions were permanent. [Id. ¶ 68]. Maxwell also testified in his declaration that "the decision to terminate Plaintiff had already been made on October 7, 2016 and that decision had been communicated to Plaintiff, and she would no longer be a McMaster-Carr employee on the date any additional time off would begin." [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 70]. In an effort to explain his contradictory statements, Maxwell stated that during his deposition, he "responded that an FMLA request would have been granted if made" because he felt "pressured to give a different answer than the ones [he] previously gave." [Id. ¶ 82]. This explanation is not satisfactory. Even assuming that feeling "pressured" [*12]  by counsel to give a different answer would qualify as a legitimate excuse offered by an unsophisticated deponent, it is not sufficient in this case because Maxwell is the Human Resources Director for McMaster-Carr's Atlanta facility. [Maxwell 30(b)(6) Dep. at 7].
Similarly, Megan Puig, who is the Employee Relations Manager for the McMaster-Carr Atlanta warehouse, testified during her deposition that she had no opinion about whether a 24-inch step stool (which had been requested by Plaintiff's doctor) would be less safe than "the 11-inch step stools that were provided" by the company. [Puig Dec. ¶ 2; Puig Dep. at 77]. Puig testified, "I can't say if it would be safer." [Puig Dep. at 77]. But in her declaration, Puig stated that the "use of a higher stool entailed" some "potential safety risks."2 [Puig Dec. ¶ 11].
In their depositions, Maxwell and Puig gave clear answers to unambiguous questions. See Van T. Junkins and Assoc., Inc. v. U.S. Industries, Inc., 736 F.2d 656, 657 (11th Cir. 1984) ("When a party has given clear answers to unambiguous questions which negate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact, that party cannot thereafter create such an issue with an affidavit that merely contradicts, without explanation, previously given clear testimony."). The portions [*13]  of the declarations from Maxwell and Puig which included contradictory statements were not based on newly discovered evidence and they were not used to clarify confusing testimony. See Bank of Illinois v. Allied Signal Safety Restraint Systems, 75 F.3d 1162, 1171-72 (7th Cir. 1996). As the Seventh Circuit wrote, "It is easy to determine that an affidavit produced in response to a summary judgment motion in contradiction of a prior statement is a 'sham' because such an affidavit is not difficult to produce and because it pops up in the immediate context of summary judgment." Id. at 1173 (Cudahy, J., concurring). This court must conclude that these portions of the declarations offered by Maxwell and Puig are "shams," and they will not be considered.3
Citing to Rule 26, Plaintiff argues that Defendant should not be permitted to rely on the declaration of Allison Thomas because Defendant did not disclose the relevance or identity of Thomas as a witness. [Doc. 57 at 22-23]. However, as discussed supra, the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 26(e) provide that there is "no obligation to provide supplemental or corrective information that has been otherwise made known to the parties in writing or during the discovery process, as when a witness not previously disclosed is identified during the taking of a deposition. [*14]  . . ." As Defendant notes, Megan Puig identified Allison Thomas during her deposition. [Doc. 68 at 24; Puig Dep. at 200, 203-04]. Puig testified that Thomas was the "employee relations manager who was responsible for supporting . . . sales and finance." [Puig Dep. at 203-04]. Defendant was not obligated to separately identify Thomas.
With respect to Plaintiff's motion [Doc. 72] to supplement the record, Plaintiff seeks leave to add to the record the supplemental declarations of Dr. Shane Mangrum [Doc. 71-1] and Rob Woods [Doc. 71-2]. Although Mangrum and Woods had previously filed declarations, Plaintiff states that she has filed the supplemental declarations in order to include the basis for the declarants' personal knowledge. Plaintiff argues that Defendant is not prejudiced by the supplements because they merely elaborate on prior testimony. [Doc. 72 at 1-3]. Defendant has not filed a response in opposition to the motion, and the undersigned finds Plaintiff's arguments persuasive. In light of these facts, the Plaintiff's motion [Doc. 72] to supplement the record is GRANTED. The court next turns to the parties' summary judgment motions.

II. Facts
When evaluating the merits of a motion [*15]  for summary judgment, the court must "view the evidence and all factual inferences raised by it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-moving party." Comer v. City of Palm Bay, Florida, 265 F.3d 1186, 1192 (11th Cir. 2001). However, mere conclusions and unsupported statements by the party opposing summary judgment are insufficient to avoid summary judgment. See Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005). "When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 1776, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007). Because both parties have moved for summary judgment, the court views all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff in evaluating Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 40] and in the light most favorable to Defendant in evaluating Plaintiff's summary judgment motion [Doc. 50].
From April 8, 2013, through October 13, 2016, Plaintiff April Nix was a non-management warehouse employee at Defendant McMaster-Carr, assigned to the position of Bin Filler since August 16, 2013. [Doc. 40-2, Defendant's Statement of Material Facts ("DSMF") [*16]  ¶ 1; Doc. 50-1, Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts ("PSMF") ¶ 1]. As a Bin Filler, Plaintiff Nix retrieved various items ordered by a customer from cataloged bin boxes which were located on multi-level shelves.4 [PSMF ¶ 2]. The physical requirements of the Bin Filler position include: lifting and carrying less than 3 pounds from 5.1 hours to 8 hours per day, 4 pounds to 8 pounds from 2.6 hours to 5 hours per day, 9 pounds to 14 pounds from 30 minutes up to 2.5 hours per day, and 15 pounds to 25 pounds less than 30 minutes per day; pushing and pulling 4 pounds to 10 pounds from 2.6 hours to 5 hours per day, 11 pounds to 16 pounds from 30 minutes to 2.5 hours per day, and 17 pounds to 19 pounds less than 30 minutes per day; reaching at or below shoulder level from 2.6 hours to 5 hours per day; and reaching above shoulder level from 30 minutes to 2.5 hours per day. [Doc. 40-10, Ex. C; Doc. 42-9; DSMF ¶ 3; Doc. 58-1, Plaintiff's Response ("Pla. Resp.") to DSMF ¶ 3]. Throughout her tenure with McMaster-Carr, Plaintiff consistently received good performance reviews, including her last year where her performance was rated as exemplary in quality and quantity of work. [PSMF ¶ 3].
On August [*17]  15, 2015, Plaintiff fell from the second story balcony of her house onto her driveway. [PSMF ¶ 4; DSMF ¶ 4]. She was hospitalized and was off work with pay for three weeks. [Id.]. Plaintiff returned to work on September 8, 2015, and, at all times from then until the end of her employment, she had work restrictions that changed over time. [PSMF ¶ 4; DSMF ¶ 5]. After her return to work, Plaintiff continued to attend periodic medical appointments for treatment as a result of her August 2015 fall. The accident left Plaintiff with an injury to her left shoulder that caused impairments to her ability to lift, perform manual tasks, and work. [PSMF ¶ 5; Doc. 60, Defendant's Response ("Def. Resp.") to PSMF ¶ 5]. From September 8, 2015, through April 19, 2016, McMaster-Carr provided Plaintiff with work that allowed her to work within her temporary restrictions.5 [DSMF ¶ 6; Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 6; Plaintiff's Deposition of 1/31/18 ("Pla. Dep. (1/31/18)") at 39-44, 48, 60-68, 85-90; Doc. 49-4 at 16].
Plaintiff testified that in January or February 2016, Employee Relations Manager Megan Puig talked to her about an office position. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 116-17]. Plaintiff testified, "[Puig] approached [*18]  me about going into the office because she said at that point, you know, I had been accommodated for a long time and she thought that I would be a good fit for a position in sales or finance." [Id. at 116]. When asked about her response to Puig, Plaintiff testified, "I told her that I ultimately wanted to go back to bin-filling. I didn't want to go into the office." [Id.]. Plaintiff testified that in March or April 2016, Puig again approached Plaintiff about an office position. [Id. at 117]. Plaintiff testified, "[Puig] said that they were getting like a sales training group together and she thought with my background from the credit union, my performance history that I would be a good fit." [Id.]. Plaintiff again told Puig that she "wanted to go back to bin-filling." [Id.].
On April 19, 2016, Defendant McMaster-Carr received a note signed by Plaintiff's physician and physical therapist which stated, inter alia:
Patient to return to previous position with the following restrictions for a two week trial period: Limit overhead use of left arm to 10 pounds with patient given instructions and education to modify work technique to utilize right arm for tasks that could be a safety risk for her left shoulder. [*19]  To complete her work duties every 3rd cycle for the first week of the trial period. To complete her work duties every other cycle for the second week of the trial period. Work modifications to include a 24" ladder/step stool to allow for safer access to materials overhead and reduce risk of re-injury.
[PSMF ¶ 31; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 48, 60-68; Doc. 49-4 at 16]. Plaintiff testified that instead of providing her with a 24-inch stool/step ladder, McMaster-Carr instructed Plaintiff not to perform any overhead filling that exceeded her restrictions and to ask other employees for help. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 64-68]. Plaintiff testified that, although she asked for help from other employees during this time, they were not always able to help her. [Id.]. Plaintiff was asked and testified to the following:
A. Megan [Puig] said because, you know, they were still deciding on the step or the ladder for the bins, like they were still working on it, to just ask for help.
Q. And did you do that?
A. I tried.
Q. What do you mean you tried?
A. I tried to ask other employees, you know, if they could help me get a box down.
Q. And did they provide help?
A. No, ma'am. They weren't able to.
Q. No one ever provided [*20]  help a single time?
A. I believe later on after the reinjury when I was in presentation Barrett helped me one time and I believe Shannon Henson helped me one time.
Q. Who were the employees who you asked for help who did not help you?
A. Little Clay—Clay—gosh. I'm sorry. I can't remember his last name right now.
Q. That's okay. Anybody else?
A. Cedrick Halliburton, Megan Ayre. That's all I can think of right now.
[Id. at 65]. Plaintiff testified in her declaration: "I found that seeking help from coworkers was not feasible because I would be assigned to a printer by myself in an area where co-workers were not close by, and also because co-workers would be behind on their work themselves and did not have time and were unable to assist me due to the pace and level of competitiveness of our work." [Pla. Dec. ¶ 4]. During this time, Plaintiff did not use her left arm to lift more than 10 pounds overhead. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 66].
McMaster-Carr became aware of Plaintiff's request for a 24-inch step ladder by April 20, 2016, and Plaintiff testified that over the next several months, she continued to request a 24-inch step ladder from her supervisor. [PSMF ¶ 34; Maxwell 30(b)(6) Dep. at 37; Pla. Dep. [*21]  (1/31/18) at 39-44, 65-66]. Human Resources Director Joel Maxwell testified:
[T]he request for the stepladder, the 24-inch stepladder was specifically regarding material on the — on the high level shelf. And so the company went through analysis in a conversation with April about how we could best do that. And ultimately April and the company agreed that the company would accommodate and modify April's responsibilities so that she did not have to fill material on the top shelf.
[Maxwell 30(b)(6) Dep. at 7, 37]. Employee Relations Manager Megan Puig was Plaintiff's primary contact in the human resources department for work restriction and accommodation issues. [DSMF ¶ 47; Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 47; Pla. Dec. ¶¶ 8-9]. Puig was asked and testified to the following:
Q. So, did Ms. Nix continue then without the ladder as a bin filler moving forward into May and June of 2016?
A. To my knowledge, [Plaintiff] continued to use the ladders that we had and continued to fill in a modified fashion during that time. And to my knowledge, asked other fillers for help if there were material on higher shelves, as she and I had discussed in order to prevent her from needing to access higher shelves.
[Puig Dep. [*22]  at 85].
Plaintiff testified that she repeatedly spoke to her Bin Filling Supervisor, Kenny Sanders, about her need for the 24-inch step ladder and about the inability of co-workers to help her. [Pla. Dec. ¶¶ 5, 6, 8]. Plaintiff testified that during the spring and summer of 2016, she also made several unsuccessful attempts to speak to Puig about the 24-inch step ladder accommodation. [Id. ¶ 8]. According to Plaintiff, she spoke with Puig in late June 2016 and asked if there had been any update on whether she could get a 24-inch step ladder. [Id. ¶ 10]. Plaintiff testified that Puig responded by saying that Safety Manager Amy Madere had ordered several steps and was testing them out. [Id.]. Defendant McMaster-Carr never provided Plaintiff with a 24-inch step ladder. [PSMF ¶ 35; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 64-68; Puig Dep. at 78].
Puig and Human Resources Director Maxwell testified that Plaintiff was granted paid FMLA leave commencing September 7, 2016, when she left work, until October 3, 2016. [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 44; Puig Dec. ¶¶ 23-25; DSMF ¶ 9]. Plaintiff, however, testified that she worked full workdays on September 8 and 9, 2016. [Pla. Dep. at 124-25]. On September 13, 2016, McMaster-Carr [*23]  received a letter and FMLA certification from Plaintiff's doctor, Dr. Matthew Marchal, taking Plaintiff off work for three weeks, until October 3, 2016. [DSMF ¶ 10]. The letter from Dr. Marchal, which was dated September 12, 2016, stated, "At this current time I see her current disabilities as being permanent and attempting to push through the discomfort will only cause worsening. . . . [I]f she could be retrained towards a desk job she could start that within a couple of weeks." [PSMF ¶ 21; DSMF ¶ 11; Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 11; Doc. 40-21].
Maxwell testified that he asked Puig to speak with Plaintiff about obtaining clarification from her doctor regarding the letter dated September 12, 2016. [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 47]. Maxwell testified that the letter from Plaintiff's doctor stated that Plaintiff's condition was permanent but did not state what specific restrictions she had, other than to state the doctor's preference for a desk job for Plaintiff. [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 46]. Maxwell also testified, "I was aware that the office likely did not have any staffing needs at the time, and I needed to know what work restrictions applied so my team and I could evaluate accommodation options in the warehouse." [*24]  [Id.].
On October 3, 2016, Plaintiff's paid FMLA leave ended and Plaintiff met with Puig to discuss the documents that McMaster-Carr "had received from her doctor indicating that [Plaintiff] would have permanent limitations and recommending that the best course of action would be to place [Plaintiff] in a 'desk job.'" [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 44; Puig Dec. ¶¶ 23-25; DSMF ¶ 9; Puig Dep. at 220-23, Ex. 35]. Puig asked Plaintiff to obtain clarification from Dr. Marchal about the work restrictions in his letter dated September 12, 2016. [DSMF ¶ 12; Puig Dep. at 220-23, Ex. 35]. An email from Puig describing her October 3rd meeting with Plaintiff indicates that Puig recommended that Plaintiff "may want to discuss with her doctor whether she should be returning to work at all at this point or whether a better course of action may be to wait for the results from the physiatrist." [Puig Dep. at 220-23, Ex. 35]. The email from Puig also states the following:
I told [Plaintiff] that we could absolutely continue to support her need for medical leave if her doctor felt that course of action would be best. [Plaintiff] said she would discuss with her doctor, but expressed concern about using all of her FMLA [*25]  time now in case she ends up needing to have shoulder surgery in the coming months. I told [Plaintiff] that I could confirm the amount of time she has remaining with Leave Management, but also told her not to worry about exhausting FMLA at this point. I explained that, while there would ultimately be limits to how much time away from the operation the company could support, that limit would not fall on the day she exhausts FMLA particularly if surgery is the reason for her leave.
[Id.].
On October 3, 2016, the day when Plaintiff's paid FMLA leave ended and she met with Puig, McMaster-Carr placed Plaintiff on a paid non-FMLA leave while waiting for clarification from Dr. Marchal.6 [DSMF ¶ 12; Maxwell Dec. ¶ 48]. The next day, October 4, Plaintiff sent Megan Puig an email saying, "[Dr. Marchal] does not anticipate me returning to warehouse duty in any fashion. Will I need to now contact Jennifer [Karas] with this update, and does my doctor need to fill out another FMLA form, or provide another letter?" [PSMF ¶ 9; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 171-73; Puig Dep., Ex. 25].
On October 6, 2016, Dr. Marchal provided McMaster-Carr with documentation in response to management's request for clarification [*26]  of the physician's September 12th letter. [DSMF ¶ 13; Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 13; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19; Doc. 41-20]. The October 6th medical documentation included a letter from Dr. Marchal with work restrictions that included one pound lifting, pushing, and pulling restrictions for Plaintiff's left arm. [DSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 107-09; Puig Dec. ¶ 33; Doc. 40-22; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19]. In the letter, Dr. Marchal wrote:
This is additional clarification regarding Ms. Nix. Her primary disability relates to the use of her left arm. At current she is not to lift, push, or pull more than one pound. She is to avoid all repetitive overhead lifting and any repetitive lifting of the arm to the side. At this point there are no restrictions on her lower extremities or on the right upper extremity.
[Doc. 40-22; PSMF ¶ 22]. The October 6th documentation also consisted of a McMaster-Carr "Physical Abilities Form" signed by Dr. Marchal reflecting that Plaintiff's restrictions were permanent. [DSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 107-09; Puig Dec. ¶ 33; Doc. 40-22; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19].
Plaintiff testified that she agreed that the October 6th restrictions set by Dr. Marchal were appropriate [*27]  "at that time because [she] had not met with the physiatrist yet." [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 106-07; DSMF ¶ 15; Doc. 41-20]. Plaintiff also testified that Dr. Marchal did not do "as good a job" completing the "Physical Abilities Form" because "it didn't seem as clear." [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 106-07; Doc. 41-20]. In emails dated October 6, 2016, Plaintiff informed Puig that Dr. Marchal "did say that we may have to do another update after I meet with the physiatrist next week" and that Dr. Marchal "also said he will update my restrictions if need be, after we see what the physiatrist says." [Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 14; Doc. 41-20; Doc. 41-21].
Puig testified that she "was not (and [is] not now) aware of any warehouse position that could be performed with a one pound restriction to one arm." [Puig Dec. ¶ 34]. Maxwell likewise testified that the "Bin Filler position cannot be performed with use of one arm restricted to one pound or less." [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 73]. He stated that because Bin Fillers must pull containers of material up to 25 pounds from shelves of differing heights, lift and carry material, and push material onto a moving conveyor, the majority of work performed by Bin Fillers "cannot [*28]  be safely or effectively done with one arm." [Id.]. Maxwell also testified that, because Plaintiff had permanent restrictions, "additional time off would not change the situation." [Id. ¶ 70].
On October 7, 2016, Maxwell informed Branch Manager Patrick McKenna that Maxwell and his management team had determined that no warehouse position or regularly available work in the warehouse could accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions. [Maxwell Dec. ¶¶ 54-56; McKenna Dec. ¶¶ 4-5]. Maxwell also informed McKenna that no office positions were available. [Id.]. McKenna testified that on October 7, 2016, he made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment based on his understanding that "there was no position or regularly available work in the warehouse branch that could accommodate [Plaintiff's] restrictions, and no available office position." [McKenna Dec. ¶ 5]. Puig was asked and testified to the following:
Q. Did the company investigate whether or not any temporary assignment of April Nix would present a substantial hardship or expense before it fired her on October 7th?
A. We would not have accommodated permanent restrictions with a temporary assignment.
Q. Okay. That's not my question. My question [*29]  is, did the company — well, why is that, is that because that's your policy?
A. That's our practice. That's — when we receive permanent restrictions, we look to find a permanent solution.
Q. I see. And so, the company did not investigate whether or not any temporary reassignments presented a substantial hardship or expense to it before firing her on October 7th, is that true?
A. True, not in relation to her permanent restrictions.
[Puig Dep. at 204-05].
Puig testified that, although the decision to fire Plaintiff was made on October 7, 2016, Maxwell was "out of the building after the 7th" and Puig and Maxwell "wanted to be able to meet with [Plaintiff] together." [Puig Dep. at 191, 205]. On October 13, 2016, Maxwell and Puig met with Plaintiff and notified her that her employment was terminated because there was no position in the warehouse that could accommodate her permanent restrictions and there was no available office position. [DSMF ¶ 17]. At that time, Plaintiff did not provide any other work restrictions or notify McMaster-Carr of any change that had been made to her October 6th restrictions. [DSMF ¶ 18].
During Plaintiff's termination meeting with Maxwell and Puig, Plaintiff repeatedly [*30]  requested that she be allowed to use her remaining FMLA leave to see if her condition would improve. In response, Maxwell told Plaintiff that, due to the permanency of her work restrictions, it was required by law to proceed with the interactive process under the ADA and that the FMLA did not apply to her situation. [PSMF ¶ 10; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 126-27, 201; Puig Dep. at 208-09, 213-14, Ex. 27]. Maxwell was asked and testified to the following at the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition:
Q. And in the — on the meeting on the 13th, did she ask if she could just have additional time with her FMLA leave, additional time off?
A. No, she didn't. . . .
Q. [D]id the company consider granting additional FMLA leave time to her before it fired her?
A. If April had asked for additional FMLA time, the company would have responded.
Q. And how would the company have responded? . . .
A. If that was—I mean, if that was—if that was what was described by a doctor and abided by the, you know, by the, by the Family Medical Leave Act, then —
Q. Well, she had been approved for the FMLA, right?
A. Yes, yes.
Q. And she had additional leave left all the way through March of 2017, right?
A. Yes. The company would have, if April had described [*31]  the need for a leave, the company would have granted additional FMLA leave.
[Maxwell 30(b)(6) Dep. at 102-04].
For the period beginning at least as early as August 1 through October 12, 2016, Plaintiff did not know if any office positions were available for her. [DSMF ¶ 19]. However, according to Plaintiff, Puig said that McMaster-Carr was "looking at putting a sales training group together" and that Puig "just need[ed] to meet with Joel [Maxwell] and Allison [Thomas] to discuss it." [Pla. Dep. at 119]. McMaster-Carr will consider reasonably accommodating a permanently restricted individual through temporary reassignment, regardless of whether such a temporary reassignment would cause substantial difficulty or expense to the company. [PSMF ¶ 30]. Plaintiff performed mentoring and training work for Bin Fillers. [PSMF ¶ 44]. Mentoring requires only minor, inconsequential lifting and involves checking a filler's work to make sure that the filler is not making errors and that the filler understands the process. [PSMF ¶ 42].
Dr. Shane Mangrum examined Plaintiff on October 12, 2016, the day before she was terminated from her employment. [Doc. 71-1, Mangrum Supplemental ("Supp.") Dec. ¶ 3]. [*32]  Dr. Mangrum testified that based on his personal observations and treatment of Plaintiff, he found that on this day, Plaintiff's "left arm was capable of limited overhead lifting" and lifting up to 25 pounds. [Id.]. Dr. Mangrum also testified that he saw Plaintiff on December 20, 2016, and that based on his personal observations and treatment of Plaintiff, he found that at this time, Plaintiff's "left arm was capable of limited overhead lifting and lifting up to 35 pounds." [Id. ¶ 4]. Physical therapist Rob Woods examined Plaintiff on October 12, 2016, and he testified that based on his personal observations and treatment of Plaintiff, he found that on this day, Plaintiff's "left arm was capable of limited overhead lifting . . . and lifting up to 20 pounds." [Doc. 71-2, Woods Supp. Dec. ¶ 3]. Woods also testified that he saw Plaintiff in late November and early December of 2016, and that based on his personal observations and treatment of Plaintiff, he found that at this time, Plaintiff's "left arm was capable of limited overhead lifting . . . and lifting up to 25 pounds." [Id. ¶ 4]. Dr. Marchal examined Plaintiff on December 1, 2016, and wrote the following in a treatment note: "[Plaintiff [*33]  has] gone through numerous rounds of physical therapy but has really failed to make significant progress particularly with repetitive overhead activities which is what her job required. . . . Simply waiting for this isn't going to really make a great improvement if she wants to return to her previous job. . . . After almost 15 months [Plaintiff] really [is] no better than she was after . . . 60 days." [Marchal Dep., Ex. 10 at 1].
Puig and Maxwell testified that Defendant McMaster-Carr uses a rolling year calculation for FMLA leave. [Puig Dec. ¶ 48; Maxwell Supp. Dec. ¶ 36]. However, Plaintiff notes that some of McMaster-Carr's own attendance records and internal emails show that the company calculated FMLA leave based on a calendar method, not a rolling method. [Doc. 58 at 24-25; Doc. 50-4; Doc. 50-5]. McMaster-Carr maintains that Plaintiff used 13.98 days of FMLA leave from October 14, 2015, to April 1, 2016, and 26.77 days of FMLA leave from April 1, 2016, through October 13, 2016. [PSMF ¶ 11; Doc. 50-2 at No. 9]. Thus, according to McMaster-Carr's calculations, Plaintiff used a total of 40.75 days of FMLA leave from October 14, 2015, through October 13, 2016, and that she had 19.25 [*34]  days of FMLA leave remaining when she was terminated.
McMaster-Carr's calculations assume that Plaintiff took less than half of a day of FMLA leave on November 24, 2015, even though she missed a partial day of work for a dermatology appointment that was unrelated to Plaintiff's left shoulder injury. [PSMF ¶ 13; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 56-57, Ex. 4]. McMaster-Carr's calculations also assume that Plaintiff took FMLA leave from August 1 through August 3, 2016. [PSMF ¶ 12]. Plaintiff, however, testified that she missed those three days of work for an asthma/sinus related condition that was unrelated to her left shoulder injury. [PSMF ¶ 12; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 81-82, Ex. 4]. Finally, McMaster-Carr's calculations assume that Plaintiff took FMLA leave on September 8 and September 9, 2016. [PSMF ¶ 14]. Plaintiff testified that she worked the entirety of those two days by performing the duties of mentoring Catherine Simeon. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 124-25]. However, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was not at work those days other than a brief conversation with Puig on September 8. [Def. Resp. to PSMF ¶ 14; Doc. 40-23; Puig Dec. ¶ 23]. In the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the evidence [*35]  reveals that she used 24.02 days of FMLA leave during 2016 and that she had 35.98 days of FMLA leave remaining when she was terminated. [Doc. 50-4].
Plaintiff testified that she was not aware of any written update to her October 6, 2016, work restrictions until January 2017. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 156-57; DSMF ¶ 36]. Plaintiff was not disciplined for any reason during her employment at McMaster-Carr. [DSMF ¶ 38]. Plaintiff was not released to full duty at any time between August 15, 2015, the day she fell from her balcony, and October 13, 2016, the day of her termination. [DSMF ¶ 42]. On or about October 18, 2016, Plaintiff filed workers' compensation claims arising from alleged work injuries she claims were sustained on August 10 and August 12, 2016, at McMaster-Carr. [DSMF ¶ 46].
Additional facts will be set forth as necessary during the discussion of the parties' motions for summary judgment.

III. Summary Judgment Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides, "The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (amended 2010). Rule 56(a) "mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time [*36]  for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The standard for granting summary judgment mirrors the directed verdict standard under Rule 50(a), which requires the court to grant a directed verdict where there can be but one reasonable conclusion. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The movant bears the initial burden of asserting the basis of his motion, and that burden is a light one. See Celotex, 106 S. Ct. at 2553. The movant is not required to negate his opponent's claim. See id. Rather, the movant may discharge this burden merely by "'showing' - that is, pointing out to the district court - that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Id. at 2554.
When evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 246 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2001). However, the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Instead, "the nonmoving party must present evidence beyond the pleadings showing that a reasonable jury could find in [*37]  its favor." Fickling v. United States, 507 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990)).
The court will apply these standards in ruling on the motions for summary judgment.

IV. Discussion
Plaintiff April Nix alleges that Defendant McMaster-Carr violated the FMLA by interfering with her right to FMLA leave. [Doc. 1, Count One]. According to Plaintiff, Defendant interfered with her FMLA leave by refusing to provide her with her twelve weeks of entitled FMLA leave and by terminating her employment. [Id.]. Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant subjected her to disability-based discrimination in violation of the ADA. [Id., Count Two]. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation and terminated her employment because of her disability. [Id.]. Both parties have moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims. [Docs. 40, 50].

A. FMLA Interference Claim
The FMLA provides, in pertinent part, that "an eligible employee shall be entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following: . . . (D) Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). "FMLA leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced [*38]  leave schedule under certain circumstances. Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason." 29 C.F.R. § 825.202. The FMLA also grants an eligible employee the right following leave "to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced" or "to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment." 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(1)(A), (B). "To preserve the availability of these rights, and to enforce them, the FMLA creates two types of claims: interference claims . . . and retaliation claims[.]" Strickland v. Water Works and Sewer Bd. of City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). In the present case, Plaintiff Nix has asserted an interference claim. [Doc. 1, Count One].
The FMLA makes it "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). "To prove FMLA interference, an employee must demonstrate that [she] was denied a benefit to which [she] was entitled under the FMLA." Martin v. Brevard County Public Schools, 543 F.3d 1261, 1266-67 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). Thus, "[a]n interference claim has two elements: (1) the employee was entitled to a benefit under the FMLA, and (2) her employer denied her that benefit." White v. Beltram Edge Tool Supply, Inc., 789 F.3d 1188, 1191 (11th Cir. 2015) (citing [*39]  Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir. 2010)). Plaintiff argues that Defendant interfered with her rights under the FMLA when the company, rather than granting her FMLA leave, terminated her employment. [Doc. 50 at 4-13; Doc. 58 at 16-25].
An employee bringing an FMLA interference claim must show that she is entitled to a benefit under the FMLA. As previously noted, to make this showing, the employee must establish that she has "a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). "The term 'serious health condition' means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves—(A) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or (B) continuing treatment by a health care provider." 29 U.S.C. § 2611(11). Defendant McMaster-Carr does not dispute that Plaintiff Nix's left shoulder injury constitutes a serious health condition. [Doc. 40-1 at 20-25]. Plaintiff was hurt when she fell from the second story balcony of her home onto her driveway in August 2015. [PSMF ¶ 4; DSMF ¶ 4]. The accident left Plaintiff with an injury to her left shoulder that caused impairments to her ability to lift, perform manual tasks, and work. [PSMF ¶ 5; Def. [*40]  Resp. to PSMF ¶ 5].
In addition to the serious health condition requirement, an employee seeking to establish that she is entitled to a benefit under the FMLA must also show that she gave her employer adequate notice of her need for leave. White, 789 F.3d at 1195. "When an employee's FMLA leave is 'foreseeable based on planned medical treatment,' the Act requires the employee to 'provide the employer with not less than 30 days' [advance] notice,' if practicable." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2612(e)(2)). If the need for FMLA leave is unforeseeable, advance notice is not required. Id. Instead, "'the employee need only provide [her] employer with notice sufficient to make the employer aware that [her] absence is due to a potentially FMLA-qualifying reason.'" Id. at 1208-09 (quoting Gay v. Gilman Paper Co., 125 F.3d 1432, 1436 (11th Cir. 1997)). "An employee is not required to assert expressly her right to take leave under the FMLA." Cruz v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., 428 F.3d 1379, 1383 (11th Cir. 2005) (citing 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.302(c), 825.303(b)). "Once an employee taking unforeseeable leave informs [her] employer that potentially FMLA-qualifying leave is needed, the regulations place on the employer the burden of ascertaining whether the employee's absence actually qualifies for FMLA protection." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1209 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(b)).
In the present case, Plaintiff's leave in October 2016 was unforeseeable to the extent it was taken when [*41]  she did not know how long she would experience the limitations resulting from her injured shoulder. Plaintiff was required to provide notice to McMaster-Carr as soon as practicable, and she needed to supply enough information for the company to determine whether the FMLA may apply to her leave. See White, 789 F.3d at 1195-96. As previously noted, both parties have moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim.
With regard to Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 40] on Plaintiff's FMLA claim, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was on paid FMLA leave from September 7 to October 3, 2016. [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 44; Puig Dec. ¶¶ 23-25; DSMF ¶ 9]. Plaintiff met with Employee Relations Manager Megan Puig on October 3, and Plaintiff was placed on paid non-FMLA leave. [DSMF ¶ 12; Maxwell Dec. ¶ 48]. Defendant argues that the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment, which was made on October 7, 2016, occurred prior to her leave request and was unrelated to the FMLA. [Doc. 40-1 at 20-22]. Defendant also contends that Plaintiff did not request FMLA leave until her termination meeting on October 13, 2016, and that because the termination decision had already [*42]  been made, she was not covered by the Act. [Id.]. The court finds Defendant's arguments unpersuasive.7
An email from Puig describing her October 3rd meeting with Plaintiff could permit a reasonable jury to find that the two discussed Plaintiff's possible need for FMLA leave at that time. [Puig Dep. at 220-23, Ex. 35]. Puig told Plaintiff that McMaster-Carr "could absolutely continue to support her need for medical leave if her doctor felt that course of action would be best" and that Plaintiff should not worry about exhausting her FMLA leave. [Id.]. In addition, on October 4, 2016, the day after Plaintiff met with Puig, Plaintiff emailed Puig and asked, "[D]oes my doctor need to fill out another FMLA form, or provide another letter?" [PSMF ¶ 9; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 171-73; Puig Dep., Ex. 25]. A factfinder could examine this evidence and conclude that, prior to McMaster-Carr's termination decision on October 7, 2016, Plaintiff "adequately conveyed to the employer sufficient information to put the employer on notice that her absence was potentially FMLA-qualifying." Gay, 125 F.3d at 1436.8 Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not have a right to FMLA leave because she did not ask for leave until the [*43]  termination meeting on October 13, 2016, and she was no longer covered by the FMLA at this time. But the evidence reveals that Plaintiff was still an employee of McMaster-Carr when she notified the company of her potential need for FMLA leave on October 3 and 4, 2016. Accordingly, because Plaintiff had a serious health condition and she gave Defendant adequate notice of her potential need for FMLA leave, the court finds that Plaintiff is able to establish that she was entitled to a benefit under the FMLA.
The final element in an FMLA interference claim requires Plaintiff to show that Defendant denied her the FMLA benefit to which she was entitled. See White, 789 F.3d at 1191; Martin, 543 F.3d at 1266-67. "Once an employee gives sufficient notice to her employer that potentially FMLA-qualifying leave is needed, the employer must then ascertain whether the employee's absence actually qualifies for FMLA protection." Cruz, 428 F.3d at 1383 (citations omitted). By October 6, 2016, Plaintiff had adequately informed Defendant McMaster-Carr through communications with Puig that potentially FMLA-qualifying leave was needed for Plaintiff.
The parties argue over the amount of FMLA leave that Plaintiff had remaining at the time of her termination on October 13, 2016. [*44]  In the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the evidence shows that she used 24.02 days of FMLA leave during 2016, and that she had 35.98 days of FMLA leave remaining when she was terminated.9 [Doc. 50-4]. This means that Plaintiff's FMLA leave would have been exhausted on or around December 5, 2016. Defendant, however, argues that Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim should be dismissed even assuming that Plaintiff's leave would have been exhausted in November or December 2016. Citing to decisions from the First and Sixth Circuits (Edgar v. JAC Products, Inc., 443 F.3d 501, 514 (6th Cir. 2006), and Colburn v. Parker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Div., 429 F.3d 325, 332 (1st Cir. 2005)), and a decision from the Southern District of Georgia (Patterson v. AJ Services Joint Venture I, LLP, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29715, 2017 WL 830394, at *5 (S.D. Ga. March 2, 2017)), Defendant argues that an employer does not violate the FMLA when, instead of granting the employee FMLA leave that she is entitled to, the employer terminates the employee if the employee is unable to return to work at the end of leave. [Doc. 40-1 at 23-24]. Defendant notes that in Edgar, the Sixth Circuit upheld summary judgment on the plaintiff's FMLA interference claim even though evidence that the plaintiff was unable to return to work was not discovered until after she was terminated. [Doc. 40-1 at 23 (citing Edgar, 443 F.3d at 510)].
Under the controlling case law and a plain reading of the FMLA, the court finds [*45]  that Plaintiff's interference claim is able to survive summary judgment. As discussed supra, a plaintiff bringing an FMLA interference claim must establish two elements: "(1) the employee was entitled to a benefit under the FMLA, and (2) her employer denied her that benefit." White, 789 F.3d at 1191 (citing Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1235). In the present case, Plaintiff has offered evidence which would permit a reasonable jury to find that she is able to establish both elements. Plaintiff was an eligible employee who was "entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period . . . Because of a serious health condition. . . ." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). At the time of her termination, Plaintiff had enough FMLA leave to allow her to be out of work until approximately December 5, 2016. Following the FMLA leave to which she was entitled, Plaintiff was also entitled to the right "to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced" or "to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment." 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(1)(A), (B).
In October 2016, Plaintiff gave Defendant adequate notice of her potential need for FMLA leave and Plaintiff was entitled to more than 35 days [*46]  of FMLA leave at that time. [Doc. 40-1 at 24]. Defendant, however, did not grant Plaintiff the FMLA leave to which she was entitled. Instead, Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment on October 13, 2016. The decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment was made on October 7, four days after Plaintiff and Puig discussed Plaintiff's FMLA leave and Puig "told [Plaintiff] not to worry about exhausting FMLA at this point." [Puig Dep. at 220-23, Ex. 35]. After Puig's conversation with Plaintiff, Maxwell talked with Puig and others about Plaintiff's restrictions and they concluded that there was no work in the warehouse that could accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions. [Puig Dep. at 190-97; Maxwell Dec. ¶¶ 54-55]. The decision was then made to terminate Plaintiff's employment. [Id.]. A jury could find that Plaintiff was entitled to an FMLA benefit and that Defendant denied her that benefit. See White, 789 F.3d at 1191.
Defendant, as previously noted, argues that it did not violate the FMLA when it terminated Plaintiff's employment instead of granting her FMLA leave because Plaintiff was unable to return to work at the end of the leave period.10 [Doc. 40-1 at 23-24]. The evidence viewed in the light most favorable [*47]  to Plaintiff does not support Defendant's argument. The cases to which Defendant cites involved facts that are distinguishable from those in the present case. In Edgar, the Sixth Circuit found that the plaintiff did not have the "mental and emotional capacity to return to work at the conclusion of the [FMLA] statutory-leave period" and that there were no "material facts in dispute regarding" this issue. 443 F.3d at 514. In Colburn, the First Circuit noted that the plaintiff had admitted that he "would not have been able to return to work until April 15, 2003, well after the expiration of his FMLA leave." 429 F.3d at 332. Similarly, the Southern District of Georgia held in Patterson that "Plaintiff's interference claim fails as a matter of law because she has explicitly admitted that she would have been unable to return to work, with or without restrictions, until more than twelve weeks after initially taking FMLA leave." 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29715, 2017 WL 830394, at *5. In the present case, however, Plaintiff has not admitted that she would have been unable to return to work after her FMLA leave had been exhausted in December 2016. Moreover, evidence in the record would permit a jury to find that Plaintiff could have returned to work before this time.
Dr. [*48]  Shane Mangrum examined Plaintiff on October 12, 2016. [Mangrum Supp. Dec. ¶ 3]. Dr. Mangrum testified that based on his personal observations and treatment of Plaintiff, he found that on this day, Plaintiff's "left arm was capable of limited overhead lifting" and lifting up to 25 pounds. [Id.]. Dr. Mangrum also testified that he saw Plaintiff on December 20, 2016, and that based on his personal observations and treatment of Plaintiff, he found that at this time, Plaintiff's "left arm was capable of limited overhead lifting and lifting up to 35 pounds." [Id. ¶ 4].
Physical therapist Rob Woods examined Plaintiff on October 12, 2016, and testified that based on his personal observations and treatment of Plaintiff, he found that on this day, Plaintiff's "left arm was capable of limited overhead lifting . . . and lifting up to 20 pounds." [Woods Supp. Dec. ¶ 3]. Woods also testified that he saw Plaintiff in late November and early December of 2016 and that based on his personal observations and treatment of Plaintiff, he found that at this time, Plaintiff's "left arm was capable of limited overhead lifting . . . and lifting up to 25 pounds." [Id. ¶ 4]. Because Plaintiff previously had performed [*49]  work with similar limitations, the court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether Plaintiff would have been able to return to work before her FMLA leave expired. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 58-59; Doc. 49-4 at 12, 22].
In sum, a reasonable factfinder could examine the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff Nix and conclude that Defendant McMaster-Carr interfered with Plaintiff's rights under the FMLA. See Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1209. The undersigned, therefore, RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 40] be DENIED on Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim [Doc. 1, Count One].
With regard to Plaintiff's summary judgment motion in her favor on her FMLA claim, the court is required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendant. In this light, a jury could find that Defendant did not violate the FMLA when it terminated Plaintiff's employment on October 13, 2016. The Eleventh Circuit has held that if the evidence reveals that "the decision maker was not aware, at the time of the decision to terminate [plaintiff], of her request to commence FMLA leave[,]" then the plaintiff cannot prevail on an FMLA interference claim. Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1236. [*50]  In the present case, Branch Manager Patrick McKenna made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment on October 7, 2016. [McKenna Dec. ¶ 5]. A reasonable jury could find that McKenna was not aware of Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave when he made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment.
On October 6, 2016, McMaster-Carr was provided with a letter from Dr. Marchal with work restrictions that included one pound lifting, pushing, and pulling restrictions for Plaintiff's left arm. [DSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 107-09; Puig Dec. ¶ 33; Doc. 40-22; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19]. McMaster-Carr was also provided with a "Physical Abilities Form" signed by Dr. Marchal reflecting that Plaintiff's restrictions were permanent. [DSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 107-09; Puig Dec. ¶ 33; Doc. 40-22; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19]. On October 7, 2016, Human Resources Director Joel Maxwell informed McKenna that Maxwell and his management team had determined that no warehouse position or regularly available work in the warehouse could accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions. [Maxwell Dec. ¶¶ 54-56; McKenna Dec. ¶¶ 4-5]. Maxwell also informed McKenna that no office positions were available. [Id.]. McKenna [*51]  testified that he decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment because "there was no position or regularly available work in the warehouse branch that could accommodate [Plaintiff's] restrictions, and no available office position." [McKenna Dec. ¶ 5]. A jury could find that McKenna was not aware of a request from Plaintiff for FMLA leave when he made the termination decision. Accordingly, Plaintiff's summary judgment motion on her FMLA interference claim is not warranted. See Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1236.
A jury could also find that Plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment on her FMLA claim because she was unable to return to work at the end of the FMLA leave period. [Doc. 40-1 at 23-24]. The relevant regulation provides: "If the employee is unable to perform an essential function of the position because of a physical or mental condition, including the continuation of a serious health condition . . ., the employee has no right to restoration to another position under the FMLA." 29 C.F.R. § 825.216. The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Defendant shows that McMaster-Carr uses a rolling year calculation for FMLA leave and that Plaintiff's FMLA leave would have been exhausted on or around November 18, 2016. [PSMF ¶ [*52]  13; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 56-57, Ex. 4; Puig Dec. ¶ 48; Maxwell Supp. Dec. ¶¶ 36-38].
Plaintiff's restrictions as described by Dr. Marchal on October 6, 2016, show that Plaintiff was limited to one pound lifting, pushing, and pulling for her left arm. [DSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 107-09; Puig Dec. ¶ 33; Doc. 40-22; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19]. Dr. Marchal also stated that Plaintiff's restrictions were permanent. [DSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 107-09; Puig Dec. ¶ 33; Doc. 40-22; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19]. In addition, Dr. Marchal examined Plaintiff on December 1, 2016, and wrote the following in a treatment note: "[Plaintiff has] gone through numerous rounds of physical therapy but has really failed to make significant progress particularly with repetitive overhead activities which is what her job required. . . . Simply waiting for this isn't going to really make a great improvement if she wants to return to her previous job. . . . After almost 15 months [Plaintiff] really [is] no better than she was after . . . 60 days." [Marchal Dep., Ex. 10 at 1].
Puig testified that she "was not (and [is] not now) aware of any warehouse position that could be performed with a one pound restriction [*53]  to one arm." [Puig Dec. ¶ 34]. Maxwell also testified that the "Bin Filler position cannot be performed with use of one arm restricted to one pound or less." [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 73]. Finally, during the termination meeting on October 13, 2016, Plaintiff did not notify McMaster-Carr of any change that had been made to her October 6th restrictions, and she was not aware of any written update to her October 6, 2016, work restrictions until January 2017. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 156-57; DSMF ¶¶ 18, 36]. A reasonable jury could examine the evidence and conclude that Plaintiff was unable to return to work when her FMLA leave would have been exhausted on or around November 18, 2016. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.216.
For these reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff Nix's motion [Doc. 50] for summary judgment be DENIED on her FMLA interference claim [Doc. 1, Count One].

B. ADA Claim
In Count Two of her complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the ADA because it failed to provide a reasonable accommodation to her disability and terminated her employment. [Doc. 1, Count Two]. The ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job [*54]  market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (quoting Harding v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F. Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001).
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation to her disability, a left shoulder injury that caused impairments in her ability to lift, perform manual tasks, and work. [Doc. 1, Count Two; PSMF ¶ 5]. Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate claim is based on Defendant's actions beginning April 20, 2016. [Doc. 58 at 4 n.2]. Plaintiff acknowledges that for the time period through April 19, 2016, McMaster-Carr provided Plaintiff with work that allowed her to work within her temporary restrictions. [DSMF ¶ 6; Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 6; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 39-44, 48, 60-68, 85-90; Doc. 49-4 at 16]. Both parties have moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA claim. [Doc. 40-1 at 11-19; Doc. 50 at 13-25]. Therefore, the court is [*55]  required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendant when evaluating Plaintiff's summary judgment motion and in the light most favorable to Plaintiff when evaluating Defendant's summary judgment motion.
To establish a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she has a disability as defined in the ADA; (2) she is a "qualified individual," meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, she can perform the essential functions of the job she holds; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007)); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007). The ADA's definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of an individual with a disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). The burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), does not apply to reasonable accommodation claims. See Nadler v. Harvey, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *8 (11th Cir. August 24, 2007) ("An employer must reasonably accommodate an otherwise qualified employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship in the operation of the business. . . . Thus, applying McDonnell Douglas to reasonable accommodation cases would be superfluous, since there is no need to prove discriminatory [*56]  motivation.") (emphasis in original).
The first prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that she has a disability as it is defined under the ADA. The relevant provision of the ADA defines "disability" as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") amended the ADA to further provide that, for the purpose of establishing the existence of a "disability," "a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B) (emphasis added).11 Defendant McMaster-Carr acknowledges that Plaintiff Nix's left shoulder injury constitutes a disability under the ADA. [Doc. 40-1 at 11-12 & n.5].
The second prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that she is a "qualified individual," which the ADA defines as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "Accordingly, [*57]  an ADA plaintiff must show either that [she] can perform the essential functions of [her] job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that [she] can perform the essential functions of [her] job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). If a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of her job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then she is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case. See Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).
With regard to Plaintiff's summary judgment motion, the court finds that a reasonable jury could examine the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendant and conclude that Plaintiff was not a qualified individual. The physical requirements of the Bin Filler position include, inter alia: lifting and carrying 4 pounds to 8 pounds from 2.6 hours to 5 hours per day, and 9 pounds to 14 pounds from 30 minutes up to 2.5 hours per day; and pushing and pulling 4 pounds to 10 pounds from 2.6 hours to 5 hours per day, and 11 pounds to 16 pounds from 30 minutes to 2.5 hours per day. [Doc. 40-10, Ex. C; Doc. 42-9; DSMF ¶ 3; Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 3]. On October 6, 2016, Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Matthew Marchal, provided [*58]  McMaster-Carr with documentation indicating that Plaintiff could not lift, push, or pull more than one pound with her left arm. [DSMF ¶ 14; PSMF ¶ 22; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 107-09; Puig Dec. ¶ 33; Doc. 40-22; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19]. Dr. Marchal also indicated that Plaintiff's restrictions were permanent. [DSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 107-09; Puig Dec. ¶ 33; Doc. 40-22; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19].
As discussed infra, Plaintiff and Dr. Marchal testified that Plaintiff could perform the requirements of the Bin Filler position with accommodations such as using a 24-inch step ladder and rolling carts and only using her right arm which had no limitations. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 136-40; Marchal Dep. at 34-36, 72, 75]. However, a reasonable jury could discredit this testimony and believe the testimony of Employee Relations Manager Megan Puig and Human Resources Director Joel Maxwell. Puig testified that she "was not (and [is] not now) aware of any warehouse position that could be performed with a one pound restriction to one arm." [Puig Dec. ¶ 34]. And Maxwell testified that the "Bin Filler position cannot be performed with use of one arm restricted to one pound or less." [Maxwell Dec. [*59]  ¶ 73]. Maxwell testified that because Bin Fillers must pull containers of material up to 25 pounds from shelves of differing heights, lift and carry material, and push material onto a moving conveyor, the vast majority of work performed by a Bin Filler "cannot be safely or effectively done with one arm." [Id.]. In addition, Plaintiff sent an email to Puig on October 4, 2016, saying, "[Dr. Marchal] does not anticipate me returning to warehouse duty in any fashion." [PSMF ¶ 9; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 171-73; Puig Dep., Ex. 25]. Maxwell testified that because Plaintiff had permanent restrictions, "additional time off would not change the situation." [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 70]. In addition, when Maxwell and Puig notified Plaintiff on October 13, 2016, that her employment was terminated, Plaintiff did not provide any other work restrictions or notify McMaster-Carr of any change that had been made to her October 6th restrictions. [DSMF ¶¶ 17, 18]. A factfinder could examine this evidence in the light most favorable to Defendant and conclude that Plaintiff was not a qualified individual because she could not perform an essential function of her job as a Bin Filler, with or without a reasonable accommodation. [*60] 12 Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate in support of her motion for summary judgment. As a result, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff Nix's motion [Doc. 50] for summary judgment be DENIED on her ADA claim [Doc. 1, Count Two].
In evaluating Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA claim, the court must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Defendant McMaster-Carr contends that the evidence in the record establishes that Plaintiff was not a "qualified individual." [Doc. 40-1 at 12]. Defendant's argument is based on its assertion that "Plaintiff's continuous, changing work restrictions prohibited her from performing essential functions of the Bin Filler position or any other warehouse position, at any time since August 15, 2015." [Id.]. And as discussed infra regarding the final prima facie element, McMaster-Carr contends that it could not reasonably accommodate Plaintiff because she could not perform the essential functions of her Bin Filler position. [Doc. 40-1 at 15-16]. According to Defendant, the position could not be performed by a person with Plaintiff's restrictions as described by Dr. [*61]  Marchal in a letter dated October 6, 2016, wherein the physician wrote that "[a]t current [Plaintiff] is not to lift, push, or pull more than one pound" with her left arm. [Doc. 40-22; PSMF ¶ 22]. In support of its argument, Defendant cites to the job profile of Bin Filler and to the declarations of Human Resources Director Joel Maxwell and Safety Manager Amy Madere. [Doc. 40-1 at 16; Doc. 40-3, Maxwell Dec. ¶¶ 12, 73, 74; Doc. 40-10; Doc. 40-11, Madere Dec. ¶¶ 11-13].
The deficiency in Defendant's argument on this issue is that the job profile does not contain information which would require a reasonable factfinder to conclude that a person with Plaintiff's limitations could not perform the essential functions of the Bin Filler job with reasonable accommodations. [Doc. 40-10]. The job profile merely describes the physical demands listed supra and offers a description of ten job steps. [Id.]. There is nothing in this document that establishes that the job could not be performed by Plaintiff with accommodations such as using one arm and a taller stool. With respect to the declarations of Maxwell and Madere, much of the testimony cited by Defendant relevant to the present issue consists [*62]  of conclusory assertions. For example, both Maxwell and Madere recite the steps of the Bin Filler job and then conclude, "The vast majority of this work cannot be safely or effectively done with one arm." [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 73; Madere Dec. ¶ 12]. And as Plaintiff notes, Maxwell and Madere do not describe which functions of the Bin Filler job that Plaintiff could not have performed in October 2016.
Plaintiff testified that using a one-arm technique while standing on a 24-inch step ladder and using rolling carts, she could perform the physical requirements of her Bin Filler position.13 [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 136-40]. A factfinder would not be required to reject the testimony of Plaintiff and credit the testimony of Maxwell and Madere, especially given the fact that Plaintiff actually performed the job of Bin Filler. When viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that Plaintiff was able to perform the essential functions of her job as a Bin Filler with reasonable accommodations during the relevant period of April 20 through October 13, 2016. Therefore, the court finds that Plaintiff is able to establish the second prima facie element [*63]  in support of her failure to accommodate claim because she is a "qualified individual" under the ADA.
The final element necessary to establish a prima facie case under the ADA requires Plaintiff to show that she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268. As noted supra, a failure to make a reasonable accommodation to the limitations of an individual with a disability falls within the ADA's definition of discrimination. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "Thus, an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and unless the employer can show undue hardship." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262 (emphasis in original). A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation [*64]  is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997) Thus, "[t]he plaintiff bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the employee desires." Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 500 Fed. Appx. 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86). "Moreover, an employer's 'duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made.'" Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999)).
An employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify her limitations and possible accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). But when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "'the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant.'" Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id.; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 Fed. Appx. 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) (holding that "where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") [*65]  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff argues that during the relevant period of April 20 through October 13, 2016, Defendant did not provide her with reasonable accommodations to her disability. [Doc. 58 at 4-12]. On April 19, 2016, Defendant McMaster-Carr received a note signed by Plaintiff's physician and physical therapist which stated, inter alia:
Patient to return to previous position with the following restrictions for a two week trial period: Limit overhead use of left arm to 10 pounds with patient given instructions and education to modify work technique to utilize right arm for tasks that could be a safety risk for her left shoulder. To complete her work duties every 3rd cycle for the first week of the trial period. To complete her work duties every other cycle for the second week of the trial period. Work modifications to include a 24" ladder/step stool to allow for safer access to materials overhead and reduce risk of re-injury.
[PSMF ¶ 31; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 48, 60-68; Doc. 49-4 at 16]. These restrictions from Plaintiff's medical providers remained in effect through September 12, 2016. [DSMF ¶¶ 10, 11; PSMF ¶ 21; Doc. 40-21]. Defendant McMaster-Carr [*66]  never provided Plaintiff with a 24-inch step ladder as she requested. [PSMF ¶ 35; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 64-68; Puig Dep. at 78]. However, "under the ADA a qualified individual with a disability is 'not entitled to the accommodation of her choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation.'" Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286 (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 948 (N.D. Ga. 1995)). The court finds that from April 20 through September 12, 2016, Defendant provided Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation.
Defendant points out that in response to the April 2016 note from Plaintiff's medical providers, McMaster-Carr excused Plaintiff from performing higher fills that exceeded her restrictions. [Doc. 40-1 at 14]. In her deposition testimony, Plaintiff acknowledged that Defendant instructed her not to perform any overhead filling that exceeded her restrictions and to ask other employees for help. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 64-68]. Plaintiff, however, testified that, although she asked for help from other employees during this time, they were not always able to help her. [Id.]. Plaintiff testified: "I found that seeking help from co-workers was not feasible because I would be assigned to a printer by myself in an area where co-workers were not close by, and also because co-workers [*67]  would be behind on their work themselves and did not have time and were unable to assist me due to the pace and level of competitiveness of our work." [Pla. Dec. ¶ 4]. Plaintiff argues that this fact shows that Defendant's accommodation was ineffective and, therefore, not reasonable. [Doc. 58 at 4-5]. Plaintiff's argument is not persuasive.
The work restrictions issued by Plaintiff's medical providers in the note from April 19, 2016, stated that she was to "[l]imit overhead use of left arm to 10 pounds." [PSMF ¶ 31; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 48, 60-68; Doc. 49-4 at 16]. Defendant complied with this restriction by instructing Plaintiff not to perform any overhead filling that exceeded her restrictions and to ask other employees for help. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 64-68]. Plaintiff followed the restrictions which were issued by her medical providers and reinforced by Defendant, and Plaintiff never used her left arm to lift more than 10 pounds overhead. [Id. at 66]. Although Plaintiff contends that she was not always given help when she asked for it, Plaintiff testified that she was never disciplined or penalized. [Id. at 68-69]. Plaintiff was asked and testified to the following:
Q. And were you ever disciplined [*68]  or penalized in any way for not performing a job duty that was part of what you were supposed to be doing?
A. Oh, no. I made it work. I didn't want to be fired.
Q. Well, my question is, when you say — you already testified that you were limiting your overhead use of your left arm to 10 pounds, right?
A. Right.
Q. So were you ever disciplined for not lifting something that was overhead that was more than 10 pounds?
A. No, ma'am.
[Id.].
In addition, no reasonable jury could find that Defendant failed to accommodate Plaintiff up until her termination on October 13, 2016, by denying her requests for leave. From August 15, 2015, through October 3, 2016, Plaintiff was provided all the time off that she requested at full pay. [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 169-73; DSMF ¶ 44; Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 44]. On September 13, 2016, McMaster-Carr received a letter and FMLA certification from Plaintiff's doctor, Dr. Matthew Marchal, taking Plaintiff off work for three weeks, until October 3, 2016. [DSMF ¶ 10]. The letter from Dr. Marchal, which was dated September 12, 2016, stated, "At this current time I see her current disabilities as being permanent and attempting to push through the discomfort will only cause [*69]  worsening. . . . [I]f she could be retrained towards a desk job she could start that within a couple of weeks." [PSMF ¶ 21; DSMF ¶ 11; Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 11; Doc. 40-21]. Plaintiff was granted paid FMLA leave from at least September 13 until October 3, 2016. [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 44; Puig Dec. ¶¶ 23-25; DSMF ¶ 9]. Although Plaintiff argues that Defendant did not reasonably accommodate her after October 3, Plaintiff was on paid non-FMLA leave from October 3 until her termination on October 13, 2016, and she acknowledges that leave is a reasonable accommodation. [DSMF ¶ 12; Maxwell Dec. ¶ 48; Doc. 58 at 12]. Given these facts, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiff is unable to show that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability from April 20 until her termination on October 13, 2016. It is, therefore, RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion [Doc. 40] for summary judgment be GRANTED on Plaintiff Nix's ADA claim [Doc. 1, Count Two] to the extent it is based on actions up until her termination on October 13, 2016. The court next turns to the issue of whether Defendant violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation to Plaintiff when the company terminated her employment [*70]  on October 13, 2016.
On October 3, 2016, Plaintiff's paid FMLA leave ended, she was placed on paid non-FMLA leave, and she met with Employee Relations Manager Megan Puig to discuss the documents McMaster-Carr "had received from her doctor indicating that [Plaintiff] would have permanent limitations and recommending that the best course of action would be to place [Plaintiff] in a 'desk job.'" [Maxwell Dec. ¶¶ 44, 48; Puig Dec. ¶¶ 23-25; DSMF ¶¶ 9, 12; Puig Dep. at 220-23, Ex. 35]. The next day, October 4, Plaintiff sent Puig an email saying, "[Dr. Marchal] does not anticipate me returning to warehouse duty in any fashion. Will I need to now contact Jennifer [Karas] with this update, and does my doctor need to fill out another FMLA form, or provide another letter?" [PSMF ¶ 9; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 171-73; Puig Dep., Ex. 25]. On October 6, 2016, Dr. Marchal provided McMaster-Carr with a letter stating, inter alia:
This is additional clarification regarding Ms. Nix. Her primary disability relates to the use of her left arm. At current she is not to lift, push, or pull more than one pound. She is to avoid all repetitive overhead lifting and any repetitive lifting of the arm to the side. [*71]  At this point there are no restrictions on her lower extremities or on the right upper extremity.
[Doc. 40-22; PSMF ¶ 22]. The October 6th documentation also consisted of a McMaster-Carr "Physical Abilities Form" signed by Dr. Marchal reflecting that Plaintiff's restrictions were permanent. [DSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 107-09; Puig Dec. ¶ 33; Doc. 40-22; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19].
Puig testified that she "was not (and [is] not now) aware of any warehouse position that could be performed with a one pound restriction to one arm." [Puig Dec. ¶ 34]. Maxwell likewise testified that the "Bin Filler position cannot be performed with use of one arm restricted to one pound or less." [Maxwell Dec. ¶ 73]. Maxwell stated that because Bin Fillers must pull containers of material up to 25 pounds from shelves of differing heights, lift and carry material, and push material onto a moving conveyor, the vast majority of work performed by a Bin Filler "cannot be safely or effectively done with one arm." [Id.]. Maxwell also testified that, because Plaintiff had permanent restrictions, "additional time off would not change the situation." [Id. ¶ 70].
On October 7, 2016, Maxwell informed Branch Manager [*72]  Patrick McKenna that Maxwell and his management team had determined that no warehouse position or regularly available work in the warehouse could accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions. [Maxwell Dec. ¶¶ 54-56; McKenna Dec. ¶¶ 4-5]. Maxwell also informed McKenna that no office positions were available. [Id.]. McKenna testified that on October 7, 2016, he made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment based on his understanding that "there was no position or regularly available work in the warehouse branch that could accommodate [Plaintiff's] restrictions, and no available office position." [McKenna Dec. ¶ 5]. On October 13, 2016, Maxwell and Puig met with Plaintiff and notified her that her employment was terminated because there was no position in the warehouse that could accommodate her permanent restrictions and there was no available office position. [DSMF ¶ 17]. During the October 13th meeting, Plaintiff did not provide any other work restrictions or notify McMaster-Carr of any change that had been made to her October 6th restrictions. [DSMF ¶ 18].
Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted on Plaintiff's ADA claim because McMaster-Carr could not reasonably accommodate [*73]  Plaintiff's one-pound, permanent restrictions of her left arm. [Doc. 40-1 at 15-18]. As discussed supra, Defendant argues that the Bin Filler position could not be performed by a person with Plaintiff's restrictions and that a 24-inch stool would not have made it possible either. [Id. at 15]. Defendant also contends that no warehouse position has lower lifting requirements than Bin Filling and that the company was not required to create permanent light duty work for Plaintiff when her restrictions became permanent. [Id. at 16-18].
In support of Defendant's argument that the Bin Filler position could not be performed by a person with Plaintiff's restrictions even with accommodations, Defendant cites to the position's job profile and to the declarations of Maxwell and Madere. [Doc. 40-1 at 16; Maxwell Dec. ¶¶ 12, 73, 74; Doc. 40-10; Madere Dec. ¶¶ 11-13]. But as previously discussed, neither the job profile nor the declarations of Maxwell and Madere contain information which would require a reasonable jury to find that a person with Plaintiff's limitations could not perform the essential functions of the Bin Filler job with reasonable accommodations. Plaintiff testified that she could perform the job using [*74]  a one-arm technique while standing on a 24-inch step ladder and using rolling carts.14 [Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 136-40]. A factfinder could credit Plaintiff's testimony and reject the testimony of Maxwell and Madere, especially given the fact that Plaintiff actually performed the job of Bin Filler.
Plaintiff has also offered evidence that Defendant could have accommodated her disability by granting her leave. Defendant argues that leave was not a reasonable accommodation at the time of Plaintiff's termination because she had permanent restrictions that prevented her from performing any warehouse work and permanent or indefinite leave is not a reasonable accommodation. [Doc. 59 at 17]. As Defendant notes, the Eleventh Circuit has held that "an accommodation is unreasonable if it does not allow someone to perform his or her job duties in the present or in the immediate future." Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003) (discussing Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir. 1997)).
While Defendant is correct that Dr. Marchal listed Plaintiff's restrictions as "permanent" in a form dated October 6, 2016, a factfinder could conclude that an update to Plaintiff's restrictions was expected in the immediate future. In emails dated October 6, 2016, the same day as the documents submitted [*75]  to Defendant from Dr. Marchal, Plaintiff informed Puig that Dr. Marchal "did say that we may have to do another update after I meet with the physiatrist next week" and that Dr. Marchal "also said he will update my restrictions if need be, after we see what the physiatrist says." [Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 14; Doc. 41-20; Doc. 41-21; DSMF ¶ 14; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 107-09; Puig Dec. ¶ 33; Doc. 40-22; Doc. 41-18; Doc. 41-19]. Plaintiff's identification of a specific time in the immediate future when she was scheduled to meet with a physiatrist reveals that this was not a situation where she was "requesting a leave of absence that would allow [her] to work 'at some indefinite point' in the future." Billups v. Emerald Coast Utilities Authority, 714 Fed. Appx. 929, 935 (11th Cir. 2017) (quoting Wood, 323 F.3d at 1314).
As discussed supra in the context of Plaintiff's FMLA claim, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff reveals that she had 35.98 days of FMLA leave remaining when she was terminated. [Doc. 50-4]. During Plaintiff's termination meeting with Maxwell and Puig on October 13, 2016, Plaintiff repeatedly requested that she be allowed to use her remaining FMLA leave to see if her condition would improve in the near future.15 [PSMF ¶ 10; Pla. Dep. (1/31/18) at 126-27, 201; [*76]  Puig Dep. at 208-09, 213-14, Ex. 27]. Finally, Maxwell was asked and testified to the following during the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition on May 22, 2017:
Q. [D]id the company consider granting additional FMLA leave time to [Plaintiff] before it fired her?
A. If April had asked for additional FMLA time, the company would have responded.
Q. And how would the company have responded? . . .
A. If that was—I mean, if that was—if that was what was described by a doctor and abided by the, you know, by the, by the Family Medical Leave Act, then —
Q. Well, she had been approved for the FMLA, right?
A. Yes, yes. . . . [I]f April had described the need for a leave, the company would have granted additional FMLA leave.
[Maxwell 30(b)(6) Dep. at 102-04].
In sum, the record evidence reveals that Plaintiff was a qualified individual with a disability, she had seven weeks of FMLA leave remaining, she requested leave at the time of her termination to see if her condition would improve, and Defendant should have been aware that an update to Plaintiff's restrictions was expected from her physician in the immediate future. Given these facts, the court concludes that a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff's disability could [*77]  have been reasonably accommodated by a grant of leave.16
The undersigned finds that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination. Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that she requested a reasonable accommodation under the ADA and that Defendant failed to make an accommodation to the limitations resulting from her shoulder injury and, instead, terminated her employment. The undersigned, therefore, RECOMMENDS that Defendant McMaster-Carr's summary judgment motion [Doc. 40] be DENIED on Plaintiff Nix's ADA claim [Doc. 1, Count Two] to the extent it is based on Defendant's termination of Plaintiff's employment on October 13, 2016.

V. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons and cited authority, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that: Defendant McMaster-Carr's summary judgment motion [Doc. 40] be DENIED on Plaintiff Nix's FMLA interference claim [Doc. 1, Count One]; Defendant's motion [Doc. 40] for summary judgment be GRANTED on Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate claim [Doc. 1, Count Two] to the extent it is based on actions up until her termination on October 13 2016; Defendant's motion [Doc. 40] for summary [*78]  judgment be DENIED on Plaintiff's ADA claim [Doc. 1, Count Two] to the extent it is based on Defendant's termination of Plaintiff's employment on October 13, 2016; and Plaintiff's motion [Doc. 50] for summary judgment be DENIED in its entirety.
It is ORDERED that Defendant's motion [Doc. 61] to strike is DENIED and that Plaintiff's motion [Doc. 72] to supplement the record is GRANTED.
All pretrial matters have been concluded with the issuance of this Report and Recommendation in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), this Court's Local Rule 72.1, and Standing Order 18-01 (N.D. Ga. February 12, 2018). The Clerk, therefore, is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the Magistrate Judge.
SO ORDERED AND RECOMMENDED, this 27th day of December, 2018.
