Opinion



ORDER re: MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT OF ALTA-DENA CERTIFIED DAIRY, LLC [18,19]
Currently before the Court is Defendant Alta Dena's ("Alta-Dena") Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment [19]. For the reasons stated below, the Court, NOW FINDS AND RULES AS FOLLOWS:
The Court GRANTS Alta-Dena's Motion as to Plaintiff's fourth, fifth, and seventh causes of action, and as to Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The Court DENIES Alta-Dena's Motion as to Plaintiff's first, second, third, sixth, and eight causes of action.

I. BACKGROUND

A. Factual Background1
Until approximately December 2011, Alta-Dena had both an ice cream plant and a milk [*2]  processing plant in City of Industry North ("COIN"). Declaration of Maria E. Flores ("Flores Decl.") ¶ 4. In late 2011, Alta Dena closed its ice cream plant in COIN. Shortly thereafter in January 2012, the milk processing plant ("Milk Plant") became part of a collective bargaining unit of Teamsters Local 630 (the "Union"). Id. Since that time, the employees of the COIN Milk Plant have been, and continue to be, subject to the policies and work rules of the Collective Bargaining Agreement ("CBA") between Alta-Dena and the Union. Id.; see Flores Decl. Ex. B.
Plaintiff was employed by Alta-Dena for approximately 35 years, from 1978 until October 13, 2013. Compl. ¶ 7. Plaintiff began her employment at Alta-Dena as a quality assurance laboratory technician ("Lab Tech") at the ice cream plant in COIN. Id.; Declaration of Sayaka Karitani ("Karitani Decl."), Ex. A (hereinafter "Godinez Depo.") 14:11-15:21. When Alta-Dena closed its ice cream plant at the end of 2011, Plaintiff began work in the Milk Plant. Id. at 15:22-24. In 2012, the Milk Plant became a party to the CBA with the Union. Id. at 58:19-59:6; Flores Decl. §§ 4, 6. In or about 2013, and during her employment with Alta-Dena, Plaintiff [*3]  suffered from disabilities for which she requested accommodation from Alta-Dena, including, but not limited to, accommodations to her working environment, her schedule, job duties, and leave, including leave under the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"). Id. at ¶ 9. Alta-Dena, via its managers, employees, and agents, including Defendant Flores, knew of Plaintiff's disabilities and her desire for accommodation from early 2013 until her employment was terminated on October 31, 2013. Id. at ¶ 10.
Upon returning from a vacation on January 3, 2013, Plaintiff returned to work with a doctor's note restricting her to "limited standing and walking until 03/03/13." Godinez Depo. 76:9-20, 77:8-21, Ex. 4; Flores Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. C. Alta-Dena sent Plaintiff to be evaluated by a third-party clinic to determine her fitness-for-duty as required under the CBA. Godinez Depo. 78:5-12; Flores Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. B. The clinic deemed Plaintiff fit to work "with restrictions . . . of standing and walking as tolerated, sit if needed." Flores Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. D. These restrictions were to remain in place until March 3, 2013. Id. Alta-Dena approved Plaintiff's return to work, subject to her doctor's restrictions. [*4]  Godinez Depo. 78:13-20; Flores Decl. ¶ 7.
After returning to work, but before her restrictions expired, Plaintiff contacted her immediate supervisor at the Milk Plant, Lorin Croft ("Croft"), requesting accommodation for her disability. Specifically, Plaintiff requested that she be placed on a shift with at least one other person so that Plaintiff would only work alone for up to two hours per shift. Godinez Depo. 78:24-80:07; Flores Decl. ¶ 9. Thereafter, Flores met with Plaintiff and informed her that Alta-Dena could not accommodate her request "because of the union environment, production schedules, and other business related factors." Flores Decl. ¶9, Ex. E; see also Godinez Depo. 80:8-82:5. Plaintiff then obtained a doctor's note restricting her from performing any work through May 31, 2013, Godinez Depo. 89:16-19, 90:1-18; Flores Decl. ¶ 10, Ex. G, and later another note restricting her from working through June 30, 2013. Godinez Depo. 89:20-23; 91:3-21, Ex. 5; Flores Decl. ¶ 10, Ex. G.
On June 27, 2013, Plaintiff submitted another doctor's note extending her restriction from working until January 1, 2014. Godinez Depo. 91:22-93:13, Ex. 6; Flores Decl. ¶ 12, Ex. I. Upon receiving [*5]  the June 27 doctor's note, Alta-Dena contacted Plaintiff and informed her that any leave beyond August 19, 2013 would not be job-protected leave under the CBA. Godinez Depo. 91:22-93:13; Flores Decl. ¶ 12. On August 6, 2013, Plaintiff obtained a doctor's note releasing her back to work immediately, with various work restrictions. Godinez Depo. 93:14-18, Ex. 8; Flores Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. J. The letter read: "It is my medical opinion that [Plaintiff] may return to light duty immediately with the following restrictions: Due to her condition she is to refrain from prolonged standing, walking, and lifting anything heavier than 20lbs." Flores Decl., Ex. J.
Accordingly, Plaintiff again requested an altered work schedule in which she would not have to work alone on a shift for more than one hour. Id., Ex. K. Alta Dena obtained further information from Plaintiff through a Request for Accommodation form and a questionnaire completed by her doctor. Godinez Depo. 95:14-96:15, 99:3-24, Exs. 9 and 10; Flores Decl. ¶ 14, 15, Exs. L, M. Flores, Quality Assurance Lab Supervisor Michelle Braun ("Braun"), and Environmental Health and Safety Manager Freddy Alanis ("Alanis") then met with Plaintiff to discuss [*6]  Plaintiff's ability to perform her position. Based on the information gathered during the interactive process, Alta-Dena determined Plaintiff could not perform the "essential functions" of her job, with her doctor's restrictions, with or without reasonable accommodation. Declaration of Freddy Alanis ("Alanis Decl.") ¶¶ 5-8; Flores Decl. ¶¶ 14-24. Specifically, Alta-Dena determined Plaintiff could not perform five of the eight functions that Alta-Dena maintains are the "essential functions" of Plaintiff's position. See Alanis Decl., Ex. A. Accordingly, effective October 31, 2013, Plaintiff's employment at Alta-Dena was terminated. Flores Decl. ¶ 24, Ex. R; Godinez Depo. 60:11-13.

B. Procedural Background
Prior to commencing this civil action, Plaintiff filed an administrative charge with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") against Defendants setting forth all FEHA-based claims later alleged in the Complaint. Id. at ¶ 13. Plaintiff requested and received a "Right-to-Sue" letter from DFEH. She served a copy of that letter and the DFEH charge on Defendants in compliance with Cal. Gov. Code § 12965(b).
On March 17, 2014, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of [*7]  Los Angeles. In her Complaint, Plaintiff brings various claims against Defendants, including disability discrimination, retaliation, wrongful termination, disability harassment, and failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, and retaliation in violation of FEHA. See generally Compl., ECF No. 1-1. Plaintiff further alleged Defendants violated CFRA. See id. On March 6, 2015, Alta-Dena removed the action to this Court [1]. On October 27, 2015, Alta-Dena filed its Motion for Summary Judgment, or, in the Alternative, for Partial Summary Judgment [19]. On November 17, 2015, Plaintiff filed her Opposition [32]. On December 8, 2015, Alta-Dena filed its Reply [40]. The matter was set for hearing on December 22, 2015, and was taken under submission on December 18, 2015 [42].

II. DISCUSSION

A. Legal Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 states that a "court shall grant summary judgment" when the movant "shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Under Rule 56, the party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden to show "no genuine dispute as to any material fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000). The burden then shifts to the non-moving party to produce admissible [*8]  evidence showing a triable issue of fact. Nissan Fire & Marine Ins., 210 F.3d at 1102-03; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). When a defendant moves for summary judgment, summary judgment "is appropriate when the plaintiff fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [her] case, and on which [she] will bear the burden of proof at trial." Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 805-06, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).

B. Analysis
1. Plaintiff's Evidentiary Objections
Plaintiff filed Written Objections to Evidence in Support of Defendant's Motion [36], in which she objects to portions of the Flores Declaration in support of Alta-Dena's Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff objects on the grounds of hearsay and lack of foundation.
When determining a motion for summary judgment, the court may only consider evidence admissible at trial, though the form may be different at the summary judgment stage. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2)-(4); Colony Holdings, Inc. v. Texaco Refining & Mktg., Inc., No. SACV00217DOC(MLGX), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26217, 2001 WL 1398403, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 29, 2001) (citing Curnow v. Ridgecrest Police, 952 F.2d 321, 324 (9th Cir. 1991)).
As to all six of Plaintiff's objections, "[t]o the extent the Court necessarily relied on evidence that has been objected to, the Court relied only on admissible evidence," and therefore, Plaintiff's objections are OVERRULED.2 Furthermore, the Court needed not rely on the provisions of the Flores Declaration objected to in [*9]  determining the present Motion, and thus Plaintiff's objections to the Flores Declaration are additionally OVERRULED as moot. See Hansen Beverage Co. v. Vital Pharm., Inc., No. 08-CV-1545-IEG (POR), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40990, 2010 WL 1734960, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 27, 2010).
2. Alta-Dena's Motion for Summary Judgment
a. Alta-Dena's failure to comply with Local Rule 7-3.
Local Rule 7-3 requires that "counsel contemplating the filing of any motion shall first contact opposing counsel to discuss thoroughly, preferably in person, the substance of the contemplated motion and any potential resolution." Local Rule ("L.R.") 7-3. The Local Rule further requires that this conference shall take place at least seven (7) days prior to the filing of the motion. Id. Here, Alta-Dena's Motion [14] was filed without the parties engaging in a "meet and confer" as required by Local Rule 7-3.
This Court may, in its discretion, refuse to consider Alta-Dena's Motion for failure to comply with Local Rule 7-3. See, e.g., Reed v. Sandstone Properties, L.P., No. CV 12-05021 MMM (VBKx), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51437, 2013 WL 1344912, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 2, 2013). Plaintiff states, "there was no discussion about the substance of the contemplated motion and any potential resolution," however does not address whether she has suffered any prejudice as a result of this failure to meet and confer. Opp. 10:8-11 (internal quotations [*10]  omitted). In its Reply, Alta-Dena argues the parties' counsel engaged in several discussions, prior to filing the present Motion, in which Alta-Dena's Motion for Summary Judgment was discussed. "Indeed, the parties have been discussing summary judgment for months." Reply 15:23-16:3 (citing Declaration of Sayaka Karitani ("Karitani Decl.") ¶¶ 2-4, ECF No. 40-1).
Upon review of the Karitani Declaration, it is clear the parties engaged in substantive conversations regarding Defendant's present Motion for Summary Judgment, a possible resolution of the substance of the Motion, and the merits of Plaintiff's claims. See Karitani Decl. ¶¶ 2-4. Although Alta-Dena's counsel ("Karitani") may not have specifically expressed to Plaintiff's counsel that such conversations were in fact intended to constitute a Rule 7-3 conference, this Court is satisfied that the parties conferred regarding Plaintiff's claims and Alta-Dena's Motion sufficiently so as to satisfy the aims of Local Rule 7-3.
Still, even if this Court were to find the parties did not adequately meet and confer as required by Local Rule 7-3, this Court would, as is within its discretion, nonetheless consider Alta-Dena's motion on the merits. Reed, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51437, [WL] at *6; See Thomas v. U.S. Foods, Inc., No. 8:12-cv-1221-JST (JEMx), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165307, 2012 WL 5634847, at *1 n. 1 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 14, 2012) [*11]  (considering the plaintiff's motion despite failure to comply with Local Rule 7-3). As such, this Court hereby elects to hear Alta-Dena's present Motion on the merits.
b. Plaintiff's claim for failure to provide reasonable accommodation.
Section 12940 states in relevant part:
"It shall be an unlawful employment practice, unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification ... (m) For an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee. Nothing in this subdivision ... shall be construed to require an accommodation that is demonstrated by the employer ... to produce undue hardship to its operation." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m).
In order to succeed on a FEHA claim for failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must show "he (1) has a disability of which the employer is aware, and (2) is a qualified individual." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m); Diaz v. Federal Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1054 (C.D. Cal. 2005). "If a plaintiff has a known disability and is a qualified individual, an employer cannot prevail on summary judgment 'unless it establishes through undisputed facts that . . . reasonable accommodation was offered and refused' or that it 'did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the [*12]  informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith.'" Diaz, 373 F. Supp. 2d at 1054 (citing Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000)); see also Perez v. Proctor and Gamble Mfg. Co., 161 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1122 (E.D. Cal. 2001).
i. Plaintiff has a disability of which Alta-Dena was aware.
As to the first element, there is no dispute as to whether Plaintiff has a disability of which the employer was aware. There is ample evidence proffered in the record that Plaintiff discussed her disability at length with various Alta-Dena managers and supervisors whom report to Alta-Dena, and as such, this Court finds Alta-Dena was aware of Plaintiff's disability.
ii. There is a material dispute as to whether Plaintiff is a "qualified individual" under FEHA.
As to the second element, Alta-Dena contests whether Plaintiff is a "qualified individual" for purposes of FEHA briefly in its Reply. See Reply 2:14-19. Alta-Dena argues Plaintiff does not meet her burden to prove she is a "qualified individual" with a disability, and as such FEHA does not apply to her and summary judgment should be granted. Id. In support of this position, Alta-Dena contends, "[Plaintiff] fails to identify any material disputes about her inability to perform the essential functions of her position, which means that, as a matter [*13]  of law, she was not a qualified individual with a disability." Id.
The Court finds Plaintiff does indeed identify material disputes regarding her ability to perform the "essential functions" of her position, and as such, Plaintiff has met her burden to prove she is a "qualified individual" under FEHA for purposes of this Motion. In her Declaration and Opposition, Plaintiff raises material disputes as to what the essential functions of her job are,3 and consequently, her ability to perform those essential functions. Opp. 13:19-7, ECF No. 32; Godinez Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12-18, ECF No. 35. Plaintiff then argues she can in fact perform many of the tasks Alta-Dena contends she is not capable of performing, in accordance with her doctors limitations, "with, or without, accommodation." Godinez Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12-18.
Upon review and comparison of the Godinez Declaration and the various supporting declarations proffered by Alta-Dena, it is clear that there remains a material issue of fact as to what the "essential functions" of her job are, and whether she can perform them. Compare Godinez Decl., ECF No. 35, with Braun Decl., ECF No. 22, Alanis Decl., ECF No. 23, Flores Decl., ECF No. 24, Karitani Decl., [*14]  ECF No. 25. Thus, in viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court presumes Plaintiff is a "qualified individual" for purposes of the present Motion.4 Thus, to be granted summary judgment, Alta-Dena must establish it provided Plaintiff "reasonable accommodation" for her known disability, or that doing so would have "produce[d] undue hardship to [Defendant's] operation." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m). "Undue hardship," is defined as "an action requiring significant difficulty or expense." Cal Gov Code §§ 12940(m), 12926(u).
iii. There is a triable issue as to whether Alta-Dena provided "reasonable accommodation."
As to Alta-Dena's burden to provide "reasonable accommodation," Alta-Dena argues that to accommodate Plaintiff in accordance with her doctor's advised restrictions would require "Alta-Dena to change the essential functions of other laboratory technicians so that they could assume some of her . . . responsibilities." Mot. 12:2-6. Alta-Dena maintains that "no employer is required to reallocate essential functions of a job to accommodate a disabled employee," and as such, there is no triable issue as to whether Defendant met its burden to provide Plaintiff "reasonable accommodation." Mot. 12:14-15 (citing Dark v. Curry County, 451 F.3d 1078, 1089 (9th Cir. 2006)).
Cal Gov. Code § 12926 states in relevant [*15]  part that a "reasonable accommodation" may include either of the following: "Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." Cal. Gov. Code § 12926(p)(2). The Supreme Court has held that to defeat a summary judgment motion, "a plaintiff/employee need only show that an 'accommodation' seems reasonable on its face." US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401, 402, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589.5
This Court finds there is a triable issue as to whether Alta-Dena provided "reasonable accommodation" for Plaintiff's disability. Upon review of the record, it is clear Plaintiff satisfied her burden to suggest plausible accommodations that were reasonable on their face.6 Plaintiff's burden of production is low, and this minimal showing of the "reasonableness" of her proposed accommodations defeats Alta-Dena's Motion for Summary Judgment. Kimbro v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 889 F.2d 869, 879 (9th Cir. 1989); see also Walton v. Mental Health Ass'n of Southeastern Pa., 168 F.3d 661, 670 (3rd Cir. 1999) (district courts may only "grant summary judgment for defendants in cases in which the plaintiff's proposal is either clearly [*16]  ineffective or outlandishly costly.")
The burden then shifts to Alta-Dena to show Plaintiff's proposed accommodations were unreasonable, or would cause Alta-Dena to suffer "undue hardship." This Court finds Alta-Dena did not meet this burden. Alta-Dena does not persuasively argue that these modifications would cause it to suffer "undue hardship." Flores Decl., ¶ 24, Ex. R. Alta-Dena reasons that such job modifications "would either require a job restructuring . . . such that [Plaintiff] would be performing a different job entirely or a reallocation of job duties to other employees, which would have been practically unduly burdensome on the other employee(s) and was not possible given the union environment." Mot. 9:18-23; see Braun Decl., ¶ 7; Yu Decl. ¶¶ 5-6; Flores Decl., ¶ 23. Alta-Dena does not provide further factual support for this contention.
This Court finds there remains a material dispute as to what the "essential functions" of Plaintiff's position are.7 "[A]n employer who disputes the plaintiff's claim that he can perform the essential functions must put forth evidence establishing those functions." Bates, 511 F.3d at 991. Thus, while there remains a material dispute as to what the "essential functions" [*17]  of Plaintiff's position are, Alta-Dena cannot successfully argue, for purposes of summary judgment, that Plaintiff cannot perform the "essential functions" of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation. Further, this Court finds that Alta Dena has not adequately shown the requested accommodations would cause it to suffer "undue hardship," meaning they would demand "an action requiring significant difficulty or expense" to Alta Dena. Cal. Gov. Code §§ 12940(m), 12926(u). As such, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, this Court finds Plaintiff has presented triable issues as to her reasonable accommodation claim, and accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED as to this claim.
c. Plaintiff's claim for disability discrimination in violation of Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a).
This Court DENIES Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's § 12940(a) claim. FEHA prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee based on the employees's physical condition or disability. The FEHA states, in relevant part: "It shall be an unlawful employment practice, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification ... [f]or an employer, because of ... physical disability, mental disability, [*18]  [or] medical condition ... of any person . . . to bar or to discharge the person from employment . . . ." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a). In order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he suffered from a disability, (2) he was otherwise qualified to do his job, and (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability. Finegan v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 91 Cal. App. 4th 1, 7, 109 Cal. Rptr. 2d 762 (2001). See also Deschene v. Pinole Point Steel Co., 76 Cal. App. 4th 33, 43, 90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 15 (1999). Upon establishing a prima facie case, the parties must then meet shifting burdens to establish or refute the claim of discrimination, as outlined below.8
In McDonnell Douglas Corp v. Green, the Supreme Court set forth the guidelines for a Title VII claim. 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). First, a plaintiff must satisfy the burden of production by showing a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. Second, the burden shifts to the defendant to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment decisions. Id. Third, if the defendant carries this burden, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant's proffered reasons were merely pretext. Id.; see also Texas Dep't of Comm. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253-256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981); Heard v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 44 Cal. App. 4th 1735, 1749, 52 Cal. Rptr. 2d 620 (1996). Establishment of the prima facie case in effect creates a presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated [*19]  against the employee. Texas Dep't of Comm. Affairs, 450 U.S. at 254. "Although the McDonnell Douglas presumption shifts the burden of production to the defendant, the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant engaged in intentional discrimination remains at all times with the plaintiff." Heard, 44 Cal. App. 4th at 1750. However, "if the defendant succeeds in carrying its burden of production, the McDonnell Douglas framework 'drops from the case' and the trier of fact determines the ultimate question of whether the plaintiff has shown intentional discrimination." Id. (citing St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)).
This Court finds Plaintiff has put forth a prima facie showing that she was terminated because of her disability. The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that "conduct resulting from a disability is considered to be part of the disability, rather than a separate basis for termination." Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1139-40 (9th Cir. 2001) (employee terminated for attendance problems raised triable issues that conduct was caused by disability - summary judgment reversed).9 In the present case, Plaintiff has proffered ample evidence and sufficient factual support to put forth a prima facie case that Plaintiff was fired as a result of her disability. Furthermore, Alta-Dena concedes it terminated Plaintiff's employment [*20]  because of her disability.10 Accordingly, the burden shifts to Alta-Dena to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment.
This Court finds that Alta-Dena does not meet its burden. In its Motion, Alta-Dena merely argues it had a "legitimate, non-discriminatory business reason to terminate [Plaintiff's] employment. That is, [Plaintiff] could not perform the essential functions of her job as a Lab Tech given her extensive and permanent work restrictions, with or without reasonable accommodation, because of her permanent work restrictions. . . . Alta-Dena's business determination . . . is a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for her termination." Id. at 15: 1-18. Alta-Dena does not further elaborate on any legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Plaintiff's termination in its Reply. See Reply 7:18-9:3. It is clear from the record that Plaintiff's employment was terminated because Alta-Dena believed she could no longer perform what it considers the "essential functions" of her position. As such, it is clear for purposes of this claim that Plaintiff's employment was terminated because of her disability. [*21]  Accordingly, this Court DENIES Alta-Dena's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's § 12940(a) disability discrimination claim.
d. Plaintiff's claim for failure to engage in the interactive process.
Under FEHA, an employee is required to "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations . . . in response to [an employee's] request for reasonable accommodation . . . ." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n). This process requires an employer to "engage in a good faith interactive process with the disabled employee to explore the alternatives to accommodate the disability." Wysinger v. Auto. Club of So. Cal., 157 Cal. App. 4th 413, 424, 69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2007); Claudio v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 134 Cal. App. 4th 224, 242, 35 Cal. Rptr. 3d 837 (2005). An employee need only give notice of his or her disability and potential need for accommodation in order to trigger the employer's duty to engage in this cooperative, interactive process. See Prilliman v. United Airlines, 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 950-951, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997). "An employer cannot prevail at the summary judgment stage if there is a genuine dispute as to whether the employer engaged in good faith in the interactive process." Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 261 (citing Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d at 1116). "Finally, an employer may rely on the opinions of physicians to gauge the employee's abilities and limits.11
In the present case, there is no dispute as to whether Plaintiff gave notice to [*22]  Alta-Dena of her disability and her need for accommodation. In fact, the record contains ample evidence proffered by both parties that Plaintiff and Alta-Dena met and discussed Plaintiff's disability and her desire for accommodations. Therefore, this Court will simply consider whether there exists a genuine dispute as to whether Alta-Dena engaged in a good faith interactive process with Plaintiff.
Upon review of the parties' testimony, it is apparent that there is a genuine dispute as to whether the parties engaged in thoughtful discussions regarding alternative accommodations that could allow Plaintiff to continue working, within her permanent physical restrictions. See Karitani Decl. Ex. A 126:6-129:18; Pl.'s App'x of Evidence, Ex. D., Flores Depo. 153:17-153:24, Ex. A, Alanis Depo. 66:14-66:25, 71:16-71:25. The record shows that Alta-Dena did, at times, accommodate Plaintiff's disability, by allowing Plaintiff to work under temporary "light duty" restrictions, or permitting Plaintiff to go on temporary job-protected leave.12 However, it is also apparent that upon Alta-Dena's receipt of Plaintiff's August 6, 2013 doctor's note, the discussions between the parties largely focused on [*23]  Plaintiff's ability to perform what Alta-Dena believed to be the "essential functions" of her position, rather than possible alternative accommodations. Id.
It appears from the record that, before deciding to terminate Plaintiff, Alta-Dena did not meet its burden to meaningfully "engage in a good faith interactive process . . . to explore the alternatives to accommodate the disability." Wysinger, 157 Cal. App. 4th at 424. Under the ADA, courts cannot put the entire burden for finding a reasonable accommodation on the disabled employee, nor can they exempt the employer from the process of identifying reasonable accommodations. Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1116. As such, this Court finds Alta-Dena cannot prevail on summary judgment of this claim as there exists a triable issue as to whether Alta-Dena engaged in good faith in the interactive process. This Court thus DENIES Alta Dena's Motion as to Plaintiff's § 12940(n) claim.
e. Plaintiff's claim for violation of the California Family Rights Act
Under CFRA, it is unlawful "for an employer to . . . discharge, fine, suspend, expel, or discriminate against, any individual because of . . . [a]n individual's exercise of the right to family care and medical leave provided by" the CFRA. Cal. Gov. Code § 12945.2(l); see also Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11094. "A plaintiff can establish [*24]  a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of the California Family Rights Act of 1993 (CFRA) by showing the following: (1) the defendant was a covered employer, (2) the plaintiff was eligible for CFRA leave, (3) the plaintiff exercised his or her right to take a qualifying leave, and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because he or she exercised the right to take CFRA leave." Rogers v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 198 Cal. App. 4th 480, 491, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 350 (2011)(emphasis added); see Cal. Gov. Code § 12945.2.
In the present case, it is undisputed that Alta Dena is a covered employer, and that Plaintiff took CFRA leave in 2013. Compl. ¶ 40-41; Flores Decl. 10-13; Mot. 20:17-24. It is also undisputed that Plaintiff's employment was terminated after her request and Alta-Dena's grant of CFRA leave. Opp. 19:19-25; Flores Decl. ¶ 24. However, Plaintiff has proffered nothing in the record to support her contention that she was fired because she exercised her right to take CFRA leave. Plaintiff merely argues that she "took a CFRA leave in 2013 and her employment was terminated just three months later. The temporal proximity of these events coupled with evidence that shows that Alta-Dena was hostile and intolerant to her physical restrictions post-CFRA leave creates a triable [*25]  issue on this claim." Opp. 19:19-25. On the contrary, it is well established that temporal proximity "does not, without more, suffice also to satisfy the secondary burden borne by the employee to show a triable issue of fact on whether the employer's articulated reason was untrue and pretextual." Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Int'l, 151 Cal. App. 4th 1102, 1112-13, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007) (affirming summary judgment).13 Additionally, as noted in regards to Plaintiff's disability harassment and retaliation claims, Plaintiff has not shown in the record any instances of hostility or intolerance towards her disability. Plaintiff has not put forth a prima facie case for her CFRA claim, and thus this Court GRANTS Alta-Dena's Motion as to this claim.
f. Plaintiff's claim for retaliation.
Claims based on unlawful retaliation under FEHA are subject to the same shifting burdens of proof as discrimination claims. First, Plaintiff must establish a prima facie case by showing: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) she was subjected to adverse employment action and (3) there is a causal link between the two. Sada v. RFK Med. Ctr., 56 Cal. App. 4th 138, 155-156, 65 Cal. Rptr. 2d 112 (1997). If Plaintiff meets her burden, Alta-Dena must articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its actions. Id. Plaintiff then bears the ultimate burden of producing [*26]  "substantial responsive evidence" that Alta-Dena's reasons were pretextual. Id.
This Court finds there is no triable issue as to whether Alta-Dena engaged in retaliation in violation of Cal. Gov. Code §§ 12940(h) and 12945.2(l). Plaintiff has shown neither that she engaged in a "protected activity," nor a "causal link" between any "protected activity" and her termination. Plaintiff claims she "engage[d] in protected activity because she complained to Flores and Alanis that she was not being accommodated on account of her disability." Opp. 20:2-3. Such requests for leave have not previously been considered "protected activity." See Rope v. Auto Chlor System of Washington, Inc., 220 Cal. App. 4th 635, 163 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392 (2013). Although Plaintiff indicates that a recent amendment to FEHA incorporates her complaint as a "protected activity," it is Plaintiff's burden, in establishing her prima facie case, to thereby show that this amendment applies retroactively to her conduct two years prior. "New statutes are presumed to operate only prospectively absent some clear indication that the Legislature intended otherwise." Elsner v. Uveges, 34 Cal. 4th 915, 936, 102 P.3d 915, 22 Cal. Rptr. 3d 530 (2004). This Court finds Plaintiff does not meet this burden. Furthermore, this Court finds Plaintiff did not meet her burden in establishing the causal link between her alleged "protected activity" and the [*27]  termination of her employment. Accordingly, this Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.
g. Plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.
Plaintiff's sixth cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy is dependent upon the allegations and claims underlying her discrimination causes of action, and therefore rises and falls with her second cause of action for disability discrimination. Estes v. Monroe, 120 Cal. App. 4th 1347, 1355, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 616 (2004)(viability of claim for violation of public policy under FEHA is tethered to FEHA claims); Impey v. Office Depot, Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75527, 2010 WL 2985071, at *18 (N.D. Cal. July 27, 2010)(wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim rises and falls with plaintiff's discrimination claim); see also Lagatree v. Luce Forward, Hamilton & Scripps, 74 Cal. App. 4th 1105, 1111, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 664 (1999).
As discussed above, this Court finds there exists a triable issue as to whether Alta-Dena engaged in disability discrimination in violation of Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m). As such, this Court finds there also exists a triable issue as to whether Alta-Dena engaged in wrongful termination. For this reason, this Court DENIES Defendant's Motion as to this claim.
h. Plaintiff's claim for disability harassment.
It is unlawful under FEHA for an employer or any other person to harass an employee because of the employee's disability. [*28]  Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(j)(1). To be actionable, there must be more than occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial incidents of harassment. Etter v. Veriflo Corp., 67 Cal. App. 4th 457, 466-467, 79 Cal. Rptr. 2d 33 (1998).
This Court finds no triable issue exists as to whether Alta-Dena engaged in disability harassment in violation of Cal. Gov. Code §12940(j). Upon review of the record, it is apparent Plaintiff cannot support a prima facie case for this claim. In fact, in her deposition, Plaintiff conceded on a number of occasions that she was not treated in a harassing manner by her managers or supervisors at Alta-Dena. Godinez Depo. 62:17-18, 62:25-63:16, 142:22-143:6. Plaintiff's only factual support for her alleged "harassing" treatment was an instance in which Flores laughed during a meeting in which Plaintiff was notified that she was going to be terminated. Id. at 155:21-156:20. This single incident, coupled with the fact that Plaintiff concedes she does not know why Flores laughed, is insufficient to raise a triable issue. Id. at143:7-144:8. Plaintiff further admitted that no one else at Alta-Dena had engaged in any alleged harassing manner. Id. at 178:2-11, 156:15-20, 62:7-22, 144:23-145:22. Notably, Plaintiff did not address this claim whatsoever in her Opposition. This Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for [*29]  Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's disability harassment claim.
i. Plaintiff's claim for failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, and retaliation.
FEHA provides it is unlawful "[f]or an employer, labor organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training program, or any training program leading to employment, to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal Gov. Code § 12940(k). As discussed above, Plaintiff has raised a triable issue as to whether Alta-Dena engaged in discrimination in violation fo § 12940(m). Accordingly, there remains a triable issue that Alta-Dena failed to prevent discrimination in violation of FEHA. This Court DENIES Defendant's Motion as to this claim.

j. Plaintiff's request for punitive damages.
When punitive damages are sought against a corporation based on the acts of an employee, the employer shall not have liability for punitive damages unless it has advance knowledge of the employee's unfitness, employed him with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct. With respect to a corporate employer, the acts must be by an officer, director, or managing agent. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(b).
This Court [*30]  finds there is no triable issue as to whether Plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages on any of her claims. Plaintiff has put forth no convincing evidence that either Flores or Alta-Dena acted oppressively or with malice. Further, the alleged "harassment" (which this Court has noted it finds no support in the record for) nonetheless would not have been committed by an "officer, director or managing agent," as required by § 3294(b).14 There is no evidence put forth that Flores, Braun, Alanis, or any other Alta-Dena employee participating in the "interactive process" or Plaintiff's termination was a "managing agent." Specifically, there is no evidence that any such Alta-Dena managers or supervisors were corporate officers of Alta-Dena, created or controlled Alta-Dena's policies, or had/have the singular authority to hire, discipline or terminate employees. As such, this Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's request for punitive damages.

III. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [19] as to Plaintiff's fourth, fifth, and seventh cause of action, and as to Plaintiff's request for punitive damages, and DENIES Defendant's Motion [*31]  as to Plaintiff's first, second, third, sixth, and eighth causes of action.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED: January 29, 2016
