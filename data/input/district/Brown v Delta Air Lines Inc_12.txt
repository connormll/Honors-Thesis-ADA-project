Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION TO DISMISS AND MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
Plaintiff Rosonda Brown, proceeding pro se, filed this action on September 8, 2022. Plaintiff alleges that Delta Air Lines, Inc., ("Delta" or "Defendant"), her former employer; Kelly Nabors and Khia Jones, both Human Resources Managers for Delta; and "Doe Manager," a Delta Ramp Manager, discriminated against her based on her race, and unlawfully retaliated against her for opposing race discrimination, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 ("§ 1981").
The action is now before the Court on Delta's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for Failure to State a Cause of Action [17] ("Motion to Dismiss") and Delta's Motion for a Sanctions Order [18] ("Motion for Sanctions"). For the reasons set forth below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Delta's Motion to Dismiss [17] be GRANTED, and that Delta's Motion for Sanctions [18] be GRANTED. The undersigned also RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's claims against Kelly Nabors, Khia Jones, and "Doe Manager," be [*2]  DISMISSED for failure to state a claim, and that the Complaint be DISMISSED in its entirety.

I. BACKGROUND
This is Plaintiff's second action filed in this Court against her former employer Delta. On November 6, 2020, Plaintiff, then proceeding through counsel, filed a complaint alleging that Delta failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability, discriminated against her because of her disability, and retaliated against her for requesting an accommodation for her disability by terminating her employment, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. See Brown v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., Civil Action No. 1:20-CV-4566-SEG-JSA ("the ADA Action").1 On August 4, 2021, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint [23], and after Delta filed a Motion to Dismiss, the District Court issued an Order [37] on July 1, 2022, dismissing all of Plaintiff's claims in the ADA Action, except for her claim that Delta failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability. See Order [37] in the ADA Action.
On August 1, 2022, Plaintiff's second attorney in the ADA Action withdrew, with Plaintiff's consent, and on that same day, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Verified Complaint for Damages [41] ("SAC") [*3]  pro se. See Cert. of Consent [39]. In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges that she began working for Delta in or about 2011 as a Cargo Customer Service Agent in Los Angeles, California. SAC in the ADA Action [41] at ¶ 13. In 2016, Plaintiff transferred into a Ramp Agent position. Id. at ¶ 14.
While at work on or about August 8, 2017, Plaintiff began experiencing extreme pain in her back and notified the acting Lead, "Mr. Fenius," that her back was bothering her. Id. at ¶¶ 19-20. Plaintiff was sent home and advised to see a doctor. Id. at ¶ 21. Plaintiff sought treatment from a medical provider, who released her to return to work with 35-pound lifting restriction, but Plaintiff's job as a Ramp Agent required her to be able to lift seventy pounds. Id. at ¶¶ 22-23, 58, Ex. I. Plaintiff also "often" worked at the International Departures wing, where she was "frequently required" to lift or carry over fifty pounds. Id. at ¶ 24. When Plaintiff returned to work on August 17, 2017, she notified her Department Manager, Alicia Kirby, of the 35-pound lifting restriction. Id. at ¶ 25. Ms. Kirby informed Plaintiff that she could not work as a Ramp Agent under that restriction and referred Plaintiff to Defendant's [*4]  job accommodation program. Id. at ¶ 26.
Plaintiff began applying for other positions with Delta that would not require her to have to lift more than 35 pounds and she also applied for long-term disability ("LTD") benefits through Defendant's third-party benefits provider, Sedgwick. Id. at ¶¶ 27-28. In May of 2018, Plaintiff was notified that her LTD claim was denied because she could return to work with an accommodation. Id. at ¶ 29. Plaintiff contacted Human Resources and was put in touch with Annelyse Sanders with the accommodation program. Id. at ¶ 30. Plaintiff completed the Alternative Position Assistance documentation provided to her by Ms. Sanders and from June through August of 2018, Plaintiff worked with Ms. Sanders in identifying and applying for positions in which "the lifting accommodation would not be necessary." Id. at ¶¶ 31-32. Plaintiff alleges that, "because of her disability, Delta would not return her to work." Id. at ¶ 32.
On August 10, 2018, Ms. Sanders sent an email to Plaintiff stating that Delta had received an "alleged return to work document" that stated that she had been released to return to work with following restrictions: no lifting over 100 lbs. occasional; [*5]  50 lbs. frequently; 34 lbs. continuously. Id. at ¶ 33, Ex. B. Ms. Sanders advised Plaintiff that those restrictions did not prevent Plaintiff from performing the essential duties of a Ramp Agent, and "did not offer any accommodations." Id. at ¶¶ 42, 44. On August 15, 2018, Plaintiff "went for her first in person physical examination and first in person disability evaluation." Id. at ¶ 61. On that same day, Plaintiff's "physician" sent a "certificate" to Plaintiff and Delta that stated that she was released to work "with lift, push pull weight limit of up to 50 lbs. repetitive duty." Id. at ¶ 70, Ex. E. On or around August 17, 2018, Ms. Sanders informed Plaintiff that Delta received the "August 15, 2018 return to work noted." Id. at ¶ 80.
On August 25, 2018, Delta required Plaintiff to physically appear at Delta's office "at the airport to complete mandatory, paid, computer based training courses" as a prerequisite to her scheduled return to work date of August 27, 2018. Id. at ¶ 82. On that same day, Plaintiff provided another copy of her August 15, 2018 "return to work" letter to "Delta employee Barron" to photocopy, after she was told that there was some "confusion" as to whether [*6]  management had received it. Id. at ¶ 83. When Plaintiff returned to work on August 27, 2018, she was asked by the "Lead in E Concourse" if she had any restrictions. Id. at ¶ 84. When Plaintiff responded that she had a "lifting restriction," she was sent to the management offices. Id. at ¶ 85. Although Plaintiff was told that Delta did not have record of her doctor's release, the "misplaced note" was found and Plaintiff was sent home. Id. at ¶ 86.
Approximately thirty minutes after being sent home, Plaintiff received a call from Khia Jones with Delta's Human Resources, who asked Plaintiff what the doctor's note said, to which Plaintiff responded that "she could not lift over 50 pounds repetitively." Id. at ¶¶ 87-88. When Ms. Jones claimed that Plaintiff could still work without an accommodation, Plaintiff "reminded" Ms. Jones that she had previously stated to Plaintiff that "all employees working the ramp had to be able to lift up to 70 pounds." Id. at ¶ 89. Ms. Jones responded that Plaintiff was on unapproved leave and that no one else from Delta would be contacting her. Id. at ¶ 90.
On August 28, 2018, Plaintiff "made another formal, written reasonable accommodation request to Delta [*7]  and/or Ms. Sanders," but Delta failed to engage in the interactive process, and never granted or denied Plaintiff's request. Id. at ¶ 92. Although Plaintiff alleges that she tried to return to work at Delta for "years," and applied to over 30 positions with Delta between September of 2017 and January of 2020, "Delta never permitted Plaintiff to return to work." Id. at ¶¶ 101-02. On or about February 5, 2020, Plaintiff attempted to log into "Deltanet," Delta's employee portal, but was unable to access her account. Id. at ¶ 103. After reaching out to Delta's Tech Support, she was told that her access had been cut off because she had been terminated. Id. at ¶ 104. Not long after, she was contacted by Delta for her mailing address so that a termination letter could be mailed to her. Id. at ¶ 105.
Approximately one month after she filed the SAC in the ADA Action, on September 8, 2022, Plaintiff, still proceeding pro se, filed the Verified Complaint [3] ("Complaint") initiating this action.2 The Court takes the following facts as alleged by Plaintiff in the Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiff, unless otherwise noted. [*8]  Plaintiff alleges that she is a Black female who began working for Delta in 2011. Compl. [3] at ¶¶ 12-14. Defendant "Doe Manager" was a "white male" and a Delta Ramp Manager at Delta's airport in Atlanta. Id. at ¶ 7. Defendant Nabors worked for Delta Human Resources ("HR") at Delta's corporate headquarters in Atlanta as an "Equal Opportunity HR Manager." Id. at ¶ 8.
Plaintiff alleges that, from around 2012 through 2014, while she worked in a Delta Cargo office, Delta Cargo Manager Alberto Cruz "sexually and racially harassed and assaulted" her. Id. at ¶ 39. Cruz made obscene sexual and racial comments to Plaintiff, forced her to watch pornography, and "aggressively grope[d]" her without her consent. Id. at ¶¶ 39-40. On an unspecified date in or around 2012, Plaintiff reported to Nabors that she "objectively and subjectively believed that because of her race, that Plaintiff was working in a severely hostile work environment," but Delta and Nabors "did not promptly investigate or [take] any remedial action" against Cruz. Id. at ¶¶ 42-43.
Because of the harassment from Cruz, Plaintiff "was compelled to apply for another Delta job," and in 2014, she transferred to the Santa Ana airport. [*9]  Id. at ¶¶ 44-45, 50. She alleges that, while she worked in Santa Ana, the "white manager and colleagues" nicknamed her "Blackie," and a "white Manager made a racially degrading and offensive joke." Id. at ¶ 45. Shortly thereafter, she transferred to LAX airport, where she was also "subjected to a racially abusive work environment." Id. at ¶ 46. From 2012 to 2014, when Plaintiff made "formal complaints" to Nabors, Nabors threatened Plaintiff with suspension without pay and termination if Plaintiff filed any complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). Id. at ¶ 49.
Plaintiff was transferred to a Ramp Agent position in or around 2016. Id. at ¶ 13. In July or August of 2017, "Doe Manager" saw her eating a meal at work and "attempted to joke," stating "Girl, don't be eating too much now, Delta needs you to be a good cotton picker, we already got too many fat and lazy she-boons out here." Id. at ¶ 23.
On an unspecified date, Plaintiff was out of work on "workers compensation disability leave," and on August 16, 2018, Delta authorized her to return to work around August 25, 2018. Id. at ¶ 21. On or around August 25, 2018, Doe Manager told her, "I'm watching you, you [*10]  better be a good lil N*****ette and hurry up and do them damn lessons because we need you here pickin' some cotton." Id. at ¶ 24. On or around August 26, 2018, Plaintiff asked Doe Manager "if there were various shift, department or schedule options available for Plaintiff to choose from," and Doe Manager, while "attempting to joke," responded, "We fixing to put you on the afternoon/night shift because you know damn well, you mooncrickets cannot wake up early and be to work on time in the morning." Id. at ¶ 25.
On or around August 28, 2018, Plaintiff "formally request[ed] a reasonable accommodation" by handing to Doe Manager a "doctor's release to work" "certificate" dated August 15, 2018, that had work restrictions. Id. at ¶ 26. Doe Manager believed that the August 15 note was "fake," "false," and "forged," and told her, "You ain't disabled, you being a LAZY ASS n****r, you just want to go back home for the rest of the summer to be a porch monkey, so you can be collecting welfare to smoke weed and eat greasy fried chicken, chitlins, watermelon and a 40 ounce, and get bred by random n*****s fresh out of jail. That's all y'all do." Id. at ¶¶ 26, 28. Plaintiff told Doe Manager, "I oppose [*11]  your racial stereotypes. None of what you are saying is true. If I didn't want to work, I wouldn't be here right now and would not have been trying to come back to work for months. I am being racially discriminated against and I going [sic] to report this to HR." Id. at ¶ 29. Doe Manager then suspended her without pay. Id. at ¶ 30.
On or around August 28, 2018, Plaintiff reported Doe Manager's alleged comments and suspension of her to HR Manager Khia Jones, and Jones admitted to Plaintiff that Doe Manager was the "final decision maker" with respect to Plaintiff's suspension. Id. at ¶ 31. Jones told her, "Well, Delta always gives the local managers the discretion to make any employment decisions they want and he decided to deny your accommodation request and to suspend you without pay. Nothing I can do about it." Id. According to Plaintiff, similarly situated white employees were not suspended without pay or terminated after engaging in protected activity, including Christine Sullivan, Sarah Caruso, Eileen Kosakowski, Donna LaCroix, Jennifer Palmer, Joanne Roy, Priscilla Ivanoff, and Maria Tamburinni. Id. at ¶ 37.
In or around early January of 2020, Plaintiff again reported to Nabors [*12]  the alleged sexual and racial harassment she was subjected to by Cruz from 2012-2014, and also reported the alleged comments made by Doe Manager in 2017 and 2018, and his decision to suspend her without pay. Id. at ¶¶ 38-39. Doe Manager eventually terminated Plaintiff's employment in or around February of 2020. Id. at ¶ 60 ("Because of DOE MANAGER's intentional racial discrimination against Plaintiff, Plaintiff suffered a materially adverse employment actions [sic], termination, in or around around [sic] February 2020.").
Based on these facts, Plaintiff asserts claims of a hostile work environment based on race, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 ("§ 1981") (Count I); discrimination based on race, in violation of § 1981 (Count II); and retaliation based on race, in violation of § 1981 (Count III). Id. at ¶¶ 62-89.
Delta filed a Motion to Dismiss [17] on December 12, 2022, arguing that Plaintiff's claims must be dismissed for failure to state a claim for relief. The time for Plaintiff to file a response expired on or about December 29, 2022, but Plaintiff filed no response. Delta also filed a Motion for Sanctions [18] on December 16, 2022. Plaintiff filed a response [21] to the Motion for Sanctions on January 3, 2023, and [*13]  Delta filed a reply brief [23] on January 6, 2023. Thereafter, on January 26, 2023, Delta filed a Supplemental Brief in support of its Renewed Motion for Sanctions [25] ("Supp. Br."). Plaintiff had until February 13, 2023, to file a response to Delta's Supplemental Brief, but she filed no response.
Because Plaintiff failed to file a response to the Motion to Dismiss, it is deemed unopposed. See LR 7.1B, NDGa. Nevertheless, while the Motion to Dismiss is unopposed by Plaintiff, the Court does not rubber-stamp a requested dismissal. As explained below, the Court agrees with Delta that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Delta and all her claims against Delta should be dismissed.

II. DISCUSSION
A. Delta's Motion to Dismiss
1. Standard on a Motion to Dismiss
Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a complaint need only contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief," in order to "give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957)). A plaintiff, however, may not merely plead facts in a complaint sufficient to find a claim to relief is conceivable; instead, the complaint must set forth "enough facts to state a claim [*14]  to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. at 570.
Delta has moved to dismiss the Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court generally cannot consider matters outside of the pleadings, and must accept the allegations of the non-movant's pleadings as true, but "[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Moreover, "a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted).
Iqbal went on to instruct that, while a court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true, it need not accept as true legal conclusions recited in a complaint. Repeating that "only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss" the Supreme Court advised that "[d]etermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw [*15]  on its judicial experience and common sense. But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not 'shown'—'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)) (other citations omitted).
A pro se pleading is liberally construed. Douglas v. Yates, 535 F.3d 1316, 1320 (11th Cir. 2008). Thus, a pro se plaintiff's complaint is "held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998). However, a plaintiff who is proceeding pro se is still required to be in compliance with the threshold requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Moon v. Newsome, 863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir. 1998). Thus, this leniency does not permit the district court to act as counsel for a party or to rewrite deficient pleadings. Lampkin-Asam v. Volusia Cty. Sch. Bd., 261 F. App'x 274, 276-77 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam); see also GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., 132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998) ("even in the case of pro se litigants this leniency does not give a court license to serve as de facto counsel for a party"), overruled on other grounds as recognized by Randall v. Scott, 610 F.3d 701, 709 (11th Cir. 2010).
As noted, a court may not generally consider matters outside the pleadings without converting a motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment. The Eleventh Circuit has held, however, that "a district court may take [*16]  judicial notice of matters of public record without converting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a Rule 56 motion." Halmos v. Bomardier Aerospace Corp., 404 F. App'x 376, 377 (11th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted); see also Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007) ("courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice"). In particular, courts may take judicial notice of pleadings and orders filed in another case. See Horne v. Potter, 392 F. App'x 800, 802 (11th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted) (court may properly take judicial notice of the pleadings and orders in another case, without "converting [the] motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment"). Accordingly, the Court in this case may take judicial notice of the pleadings and other documents filed in the ADA Case without converting Delta's Motion to Dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.
2. Prohibition Against Claim Splitting
The Court finds that, even if Plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for race discrimination or retaliation, Plaintiff's claims would be subject to dismissal for improper claim splitting. The claim-splitting doctrine prohibits plaintiffs from separating claims [*17]  concerning the same subject matter and bringing them piecemeal across multiple lawsuits. Vanover v. NCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 857 F.3d 833, 840-41 (11th Cir. 2017). The Eleventh Circuit has held that, under this doctrine, plaintiffs are not permitted to file concurrent complaints involving the same parties and arising from the same transaction or series of transactions. See id. at 840-43 (affirming district court's dismissal of a second lawsuit as duplicative of a prior, pending lawsuit based on the same underlying facts).
The claim-splitting doctrine derives from the doctrine of res judicata. Id. at 836 n.1. Under the principle of res judicata, or claim preclusion, a final judgment on the merits in a civil action operates to preclude a party, or those in privity with that party, from re-litigating in a subsequent proceeding issues that were or could have been raised in the original action. See Federated Dep't Stores, Inc., v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 398, 101 S. Ct. 2424, 69 L. Ed. 2d 103 (1981); see Pleming v. Universal-Rundle Corp., 142 F.3d 1354, 1356 (11th Cir. 1998). The purpose behind the doctrine of res judicata is that "preclud[ing] parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate protects [a party's] adversaries from the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions." Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1979); see [*18]  also Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., 193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir. 1999).
In the Eleventh Circuit, res judicata bars the filing of claims which were raised or could have been raised in an earlier proceeding. Ragsdale, 193 F.3d at 1238. "A claim will be barred by prior litigation if all four of the following elements are present: (1) there is a final judgment on the merits; (2) the decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the parties, or those in privity with them, are identical in both suits; and (4) the same cause of action is involved in both cases." Id. For purposes of the fourth element of res judicata, if a case arises out of the same nucleus of operative fact, or is based upon the same factual predicate, as a former action, then the "same cause of action" is involved. Id. at 1239.
While res judicata bars a second lawsuit after there has been a final judgment on the merits in the first action, the claim-splitting doctrine applies to bar a second lawsuit when it is filed before the first lawsuit has reached a final judgment.3 See Vanover, 857 F.3d at 840 n.3 (citing Zephyr Aviation III, L.L.C. v. Keytech Ltd., No. 8:07-CV-227-T-27TGW, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21944, 2008 WL 759095, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 20, 2008)); see also Watkins v. Elmore, 745 F. App'x 100, 104 n.2 (11th Cir. 2018). The courts instead simply ask "whether the first suit, assuming it were final, would preclude the second suit." Vanover, 857 F.3d at 841 (emphasis added). "The rule against claim-splitting requires a plaintiff to assert all of its causes [*19]  of action arising from a common set of facts in one lawsuit. By spreading claims around in multiple lawsuits in other courts or before other judges, parties waste 'scarce judicial resources' and undermine 'the efficient and comprehensive disposition of cases.'" Id. (quoting Katz v. Gerardi, 655 F.3d 1212, 1217 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting Hartsel Springs Ranch of Colo., Inc. v. Bluegreen Corp., 296 F.3d 982, 985 (10th Cir. 2002)); citing Curtis v. Citibank N.A., 226 F.3d 133, 139 (2d Cir. 2000) ("[P]laintiffs have no right to maintain two actions on the same subject in the same court, against the same defendant at the same time.")). "The claim-splitting doctrine thereby ensures that a plaintiff may not split up his demand and prosecute it by piecemeal, or present only a portion of the grounds upon which relief is sought, and leave the rest to be presented in a second suit, if the first fails." Id. (citations and internal quotations omitted).
In essence, the claim-splitting doctrine requires a plaintiff to assert all of his causes of action arising from a common set of facts in one lawsuit. Kennedy v. Floridian Hotel, Inc., 998 F.3d 1221, 1236 (11th Cir. 2021). The doctrine prevents a plaintiff from prosecuting a second suit "before the first suit has reached a final judgment," promotes judicial economy, and shields parties from "vexatious and duplicative litigation while empowering the district court to manage [*20]  its docket." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
To determine whether a plaintiff has engaged in improper claim-splitting, the Court must determine: 1) whether the second case involves the same parties and their privies as the first case, and 2) whether the separate cases arise from the same transaction or series of transactions. See Vanover, 857 F.3d at 841-42. Significantly, the addition of "separate causes of action" does not prevent the application of the claim-splitting doctrine. Id. at 843; see also McQueen v. Alabama Dep't of Transportation, No. 2:17-CV-215-TFM, 2018 WL 2709319, at *8 (M.D. Ala. June 5, 2018). Even when a plaintiff brings a separate cause of action in the second case, claims are barred in the second action when they arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact, or are based on the same factual predicate, as those claims in the first action. See In re Piper Aircraft Corp., 244 F.3d 1289, 1296-97 (11th Cir. 2001).
In this case, the parties are identical to the parties in the ADA Action—in both cases, Plaintiff has sued Delta for alleged discrimination against her during her employment. The individual managers and employees of Delta who Plaintiff also purports to sue in this action clearly qualify as Delta's privies in this matter. See, e.g., Henry v. Farmer City State Bank, 808 F.2d 1228, 1235 n.6 (7th Cir. 1986) ("Even though the Bank was the only actual party to the state court mortgage foreclosure proceedings, the other defendants, as [*21]  directors, officers, employees, and attorneys of the Bank, are in privity with the Bank for purposes of res judicata.") (citation omitted). Moreover, although Plaintiff has added many new factual allegations in this case, her claims in this case are based on the same transaction or series of transactions as her claims in the ADA Action. In both cases, her claims are based on her alleged request for an accommodation for her disability on August 27, 2018, being sent home on that day, and the eventual termination of her employment in February of 2020. Although Plaintiff claims in the ADA Action that Delta violated the ADA, and in this action, she claims that Delta violated § 1981, her claims in both cases are based on the same predicate of facts, or on "facts that are sufficiently related in time, space, origin, and motivation." See Kennedy, 998 F.3d at 1236.
At the time Plaintiff filed the ADA Action on November 6, 2020, all of the facts surrounding Plaintiff's alleged suspension in 2018 and her termination in February of 2020 were known to her, and she could have brought her § 1981 claims against Delta in the ADA Action. Indeed, she filed the Complaint in this action approximately one month after she filed the Second Amended [*22]  Complaint in the ADA Action, and she offers no explanation as to why she failed to include her § 1981 claims against Delta in the ADA Action. Thus, if final judgment had already been entered against Delta in the ADA Action, her claims in this action would be subject to dismissal on res judicata grounds. For that reason, Plaintiff's claims in this case are barred by the claim-splitting doctrine and must be dismissed on that ground. See Klayman v. Porter, No. 22-13025, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 4821, 2023 WL 2261814, at *3-4 (11th Cir. Feb. 28, 2023) (second case barred when the plaintiff alleged defendants engaged in the same pattern of abusive investigations).
3. Timeliness of Plaintiff's Claims
In its Motion to Dismiss, Delta argues that all of Plaintiff's claims based on events that allegedly occurred prior to September 8, 2018, are barred by the statute of limitations under § 1981. See Def. Br. [17-1] at 18-19.
There is no express statute of limitations provided in § 1981. See Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541 U.S. 369, 371, 124 S. Ct. 1836, 158 L. Ed. 2d 645 (2004); Edwards v. Nat'l Vision Inc., 568 F. App'x 854, 860 (11th Cir. 2014). Before 1990, federal courts were required to apply the most analogous state statute of limitations to § 1981 claims. Jones, 541 U.S. at 371 (citing Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U.S. 656, 660, 107 S. Ct. 2617, 96 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1987)). In Georgia, that was the two-year statute of limitations applicable to personal injury torts. Saunders v. Emory Healthcare, Inc., 360 F. App'x 110, 114 (11th Cir. 2010); Transmax Prods., LLC v. Swartzberg, No. 1:19-CV-03568-SDG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156551, 2020 WL 5095370, at *6 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 28, 2020). In 1990, however, Congress enacted 28 U.S.C. § 1658(a), which created a default four-year limitations period for federal causes of action [*23]  created after December 1, 1990. Jones, 541 U.S. at 371; Edwards, 568 F. App'x at 860; Price v. M & H Valve Co., 177 F. App'x 1, 10 (11th Cir. 2006).
As originally drafted, § 1981 provided that citizens of all races shall have the same right to "make and enforce contracts." Act of Apr. 9, 1866, Ch. 395, § 1, 14 Stat. 27. In 1989, the Supreme Court narrowly interpreted the scope of this provision, finding that it only forbids "the mak[ing] and enforce[ment] of contracts alone," as opposed to "a general proscription of racial discrimination in all aspect of contract relations." Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 176, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1989) (finding that the plaintiff's claims that she had been harassed and fired because of her race were not based on conduct prohibited by § 1981, because the conduct did not involve a refusal to enter a contract with the plaintiff or the impairment of her ability to enforce her contractual rights).
In response to Patterson, however, Congress amended § 1981 in 1991 to broadly define the term "make and enforce contracts" to include "the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship." 42 U.S.C. § 1981(b); see Jones, 541 U.S. at 373; see also Andrews v. Lakeshore Rehab. Hosp., 140 F.3d 1405, 1410 (11th Cir. 1998) ("Both the Supreme Court and this Court have acknowledged that the 1991 Act was a direct response to Patterson and its progeny."). The 1991 amendment applied to cover conduct that occurred after [*24]  the initial formation of a contract, including the imposition of discriminatory working conditions in the employment context. Grimes v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Georgia, 650 F. App'x 647, 651 (11th Cir. 2016). As a result, claims brought under § 1981 that were cognizable before the 1991 amendment are subject to a two-year statute of limitations, while claims that were not cognizable until the 1991 amendment are subject to a four-year statute of limitations. Grimes, 650 F. App'x at 651; Edwards, 568 F. App'x at 860; Price, 177 F. App'x at 10; Transmax Prods., 2020 WL 5095370, at *6; see also Jones, 541 U.S. at 382.
In this case, Delta contends that, because Plaintiff's claims are not based on the "making or enforcing" of a contract, but are based on events that occurred after she had already established an employment relationship with Delta, a four-year statute of limitations applies. Def. Br. at 18. Because Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this case on September 8, 2022, Delta argues, any claim that is based on events that occurred prior to September 8, 2018, is time-barred under § 1981. Id. As a result, according to Delta, almost all of Plaintiff's claims are time-barred because they are based on events that occurred prior to September 8, 2018. See id. at 18-19.
Specifically, Delta notes that Plaintiff alleges that she was harassed by Cruz from 2012-2014; she overheard a racial joke from a manager in Santa Ana Airport [*25]  in 2014; Doe Manager made racial statements to her in 2017, and on August 25, 26, and 28, 2018; Doe Manager suspended her on August 28, 2018; and Jones allegedly "ratified" that suspension decision on August 28, 2018. See Compl. at ¶¶ 23, 25, 28, 39, 44, 46. Because all those events occurred prior to September 8, 2018, Delta argues, Plaintiff's claims based on those events are time-barred. Def. Br. at 18-19. Thus, according to Delta, "the only possible timely adverse action within four years of her filing this suit is her early 2020 termination." Id. at 19. The Court agrees.
In Count I of the Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim for a "Hostile Work Environment Based on Race in Violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (CONTINUAL VIOLATION FROM 2012-2020)." Compl. at 14 (emphasis in original). The Court infers that Plaintiff is alleging that she was subjected to a hostile work environment based on race from 2012 through 2020.
When a plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to unlawful discrimination as a result of a hostile work environment, she may state a viable claim based on acts outside of the applicable statute of limitations, so long as "an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period." Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 117 (2002) [*26] . The Supreme Court explained in Morgan that "[p]rovided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability." Id. at 117.
While the Morgan case involved a claim of a hostile work environment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq., in cases in which a plaintiff has asserted a claim under § 1981 as a remedy for race discrimination in the employment context, the elements required to establish a claim under § 1981 generally mirror those required for a Title VII claim. See Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir. 1998). Thus, the principle expounded in Morgan would generally apply to claims of a hostile work environment brought under § 1981.
Under the Eleventh Circuit's framing of Morgan, a court may consider untimely acts if they are "sufficiently related" to a timely hostile work environment claim that they "may be fairly considered part of the same claim." See Chambless v. Louisiana-Pacific Corp., 481 F.3d 1345, 1350 (11th Cir. 2007). In Chambless, the plaintiff sued her employer for sexual harassment, but her allegations of sexually harassing conduct such as sexual touching, jokes, propositioning, ridicule for pregnancy, and social isolation were all found to be untimely. See id. at 1347. The plaintiff nevertheless had timely claims for sex discrimination based on the defendant's failure to promote her, and for retaliatory discharge. See id. The Eleventh Circuit held that the discrete acts of failure to promote and discharge were not sufficiently related to the earlier incidents [*27]  of sexual harassment—that is, they were not the "same type of 'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult' that characterized the untimely allegations," and could not save her untimely acts from the statute of limitations. See id. at 1350 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)).
The following year, the Eleventh Circuit clarified that under Morgan, "discrete acts" of discrimination and retaliation cannot be combined with allegations of harassment as part of the same harassment claim and cannot save untimely allegations of harassing conduct. See McCann v. Tillman, 526 F.3d 1370, 1379 (11th Cir. 2008); Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., 516 F.3d 955, 970-72 (11th Cir. 2008). Thus, to combine untimely acts with timely acts under Morgan, the untimely acts must be sufficiently related to the timely acts so as to form part of the same hostile work environment claim, and both the timely and untimely acts must be acts of harassment contributing to a hostile work environment, not discrete employment actions such as termination.
In this case, Plaintiff filed the complaint on September 8, 2022. Thus, for her § 1981 claims to be timely, she must show that at least some acts contributing to the alleged hostile work environment occurred within the previous four-year period, or on or after September 8, 2018. But Plaintiff does not allege that anyone at Delta made any comments [*28]  about her race at any time after August 28, 2018. As Defendant correctly notes, the only act she complains about that occurred on or after September 8, 2018, was her alleged termination that occurred in or around February of 2020. But, as discussed, discrete adverse employment actions, such as terminations, "must be challenged as separate discrimination and retaliation claims." McCann, 526 F.3d at 1379. Discrete acts of discrimination "cannot be brought under a hostile work environment claim that centers on 'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.'" Id. (quoting Morgan, 536 U.S. at 116).
In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff's claims based on events that occurred prior to September 8, 2018, are time-barred under § 1981. Further, because Plaintiff's claim of a hostile work environment based on race is based on events that occurred entirely before September 8, 2018, the Court finds that Count I of the Complaint must be dismissed as untimely under § 1981.
4. Plaintiff's Failure to State a Claim
Delta argues further that, to the extent that Plaintiff bases her claims on her termination that occurred in or around February of 2020, her claims in Counts II and III must be dismissed for failure to state a claim under § 1981. See Def. Br. at 19-23. [*29]  Delta argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a plausible claim that Delta discriminated against her because of her race, or retaliated against her, when it terminated her employment. See id.
As discussed, in Count II, Plaintiff asserts a claim of race discrimination, in violation of § 1981, and in Count III, she asserts a claim of race-based retaliation, in violation of § 1981. Compl. at ¶¶ 76-89. Plaintiff alleges that "Defendants" discriminated against her by calling her "racially degrading names, suspending her without pay . . . , intentionally violating her rights under the ADA on the basis of her race, and terminating her." Id. at ¶ 77. She also alleges that "Defendants' managers, agents and employees" retaliated against her for complaining about a "racially abusive hostile work environment" when they suspended her without pay and terminated her employment. Id. at ¶¶ 83-84. Because Plaintiff's claims based on any events that occurred prior to September 8, 2018, are time-barred, the only act that may form the basis of Plaintiff's claims of discrimination or retaliation is her termination that allegedly occurred in or around February of 2020.
a. Race Discrimination
In Count II, Plaintiff asserts [*30]  a claim of race discrimination under § 1981, which provides as follows:

(a) Statement of equal rights
All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.

(b) "Make and enforce contracts" defined
For purposes of this section, the term "make and enforce contracts" includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.

(c) Protection against impairment
The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of State law.
42 U.S.C. § 1981.
To establish a claim of race discrimination under § 1981, a plaintiff must generally establish that: (1) the plaintiff was a member of a racial minority; (2) the defendant intended to discriminate on the basis of [*31]  race; and (3) the discrimination concerned one or more of the activities enumerated in the statute. See White v. Fla. Highway Patrol, Div. of Fla. Dep't of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles, 928 F. Supp. 1153, 1157 (M.D. Fla. 1996) (citing Milan v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Sec. Corp., 7 F.3d 1085, 1087 (2d Cir. 1993)).
It is well-settled law that § 1981 prohibits race discrimination in the employment context. See Davis v. Legal Servs. Alabama, Inc., 19 F.4th 1261, 1265 (11th Cir. 2021) ("Section 1981 . . . prohibits race discrimination in employment."); see also St. Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 609, 107 S. Ct. 2022, 95 L. Ed. 2d 582 (1987) ("Although § 1981 does not itself use the word 'race,' the Court has construed the section to forbid all 'racial' discrimination in the making of private as well as public contracts."); Little v. United Techs., Carrier Transicold Div., 103 F.3d 956, 961 (11th Cir. 1997) ("It is well-established that § 1981 is concerned with racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts."); Brown v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 939 F.2d 946, 949 (11th Cir. 1991) ("The aim of the statute is to remove the impediment of discrimination from a minority citizen's ability to participate fully and equally in the marketplace.").
For claims of race discrimination in the employment context, the elements required to establish a claim under § 1981 generally mirror those required for a Title VII claim. See Smelter v. S. Home Care Servs. Inc., 904 F.3d 1276, 1283 n.3 (11th Cir. 2018) (Title VII claims and § 1981 claims "have the same requirements of proof and utilize the same analytical framework") (quoting Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1325 n.14 (11th Cir. 2011)); Jefferson v. Sewon Am., Inc., 891 F.3d 911, 919 (11th Cir. 2018) ("We examine claims of discrimination and retaliation under the same legal framework regardless of whether the plaintiff invokes section 1981 or section 2000e."); Surtain v. Hamlin Terrace Found., 789 F.3d 1239, 1245 n.6 (11th Cir. 2015) ("the same analytical framework and [*32]  proof requirements that apply to employment discrimination claims under Title VII also apply to discrimination claims under Section 1981"); Chapter 7 Tr. v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 683 F.3d 1249, 1256-57 (11th Cir. 2012) ("Title VII and § 1981 'have the same requirements of proof and use the same analytical framework.'") (quoting Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir. 1998)).
Unlike Title VII, however, § 1981 provides for liability not only against a person's employer but also against an individual supervisor who was involved in a decision to hire or fire or recommended such a decision. See Moss v. W & A Cleaners, 111 F. Supp. 2d 1181 (M.D. Ala. 2000); Leige v. Capitol Chevrolet, Inc., 895 F. Supp. 289, 293 (M.D. Ala. 1995); see also Burstein v. Emtel, Inc., 137 F. App'x 205, 208 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (an individual who did not participate in a decision not to offer an employment contract to the plaintiff was not liable under § 1981 because he did not participate in the decision); Faraca v. Clements, 506 F.2d 956, 959-60 (5th Cir. 1975) (noting that "a third party's interference with those rights guaranteed under [§ 1981] will subject such a person to personal liability").4
To state a discrimination claim under Title VII or § 1981, a complaint must provide enough factual matter, when taken as true, to suggest intentional discrimination. Surtain, 789 F.3d at 1246. Accordingly, such a claim "should not be dismissed 'when the well-pleaded factual allegations . . . plausibly suggest that the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action due to intentional race discrimination.'" Henderson v. City of Birmingham, Alabama, 826 F. App'x 736, 740-41 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting Surtain, 789 F.3d at 1246).
Thus, a plaintiff [*33]  is not required to plead every detail that would ultimately prove a claim of race discrimination, but a complaint must nevertheless state sufficient facts that would ultimately support a plausible claim for discrimination or retaliation. See Edwards v. Prime, Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1300, 1302 (11th Cir. 2010) (affirming dismissal of complaint alleging discrimination and sexual harassment because no facts were alleged that plausibly supported either an allegation of discriminatory intent or a prima facie case of sexual harassment). In other words, to assert a viable claim of race discrimination under Title VII or § 1981, a plaintiff must allege facts that are "sufficient to create an inference of discrimination." Hopkins v. Saint Lucie Cnty. Sch. Bd., 399 F. App'x 563, 565 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1564 (11th Cir. 1997) (quotation marks omitted)).
Although a plaintiff claiming disparate treatment is not limited to any particular formula, a common way of alleging discrimination on the basis of a protected characteristic is to establish the following elements of a prima facie case that would normally be required under Title VII: she is a member of a protected class, such as persons of a particular race or sex; she suffered an adverse employment action; and she was treated less favorably by her employer than one or more similarly situated individuals outside [*34]  her protected class of race or sex. See Maynard v. Bd. of Regents, 342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir. 2003); Knight v. Baptist Hosp. of Miami, Inc., 330 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). Significantly, the adverse employment action prong is not only an element of the prima facie case, but an element of the claim itself. Holland v. Gee, 677 F.3d 1047, 1056 (11th Cir. 2012).
In the Motion to Dismiss, Delta argues that Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts sufficient to plausibly support any causation between her race and her termination. Def. Br. at 19. Instead, Plaintiff alleges that she was terminated for "requesting a reasonable accommodation for Plaintiff's disability." See Compl. at ¶ 57. Delta argues that, while being terminated for requesting an accommodation can possibly state a cause of action under the ADA, it cannot state a cause of action under § 1981. Def. Br. at 20. Further, Delta argues, Plaintiff's § 1981 termination claims "are actually just a restatement of her ADA discrimination and retaliation claim that this Court has already dismissed on the merits in Brown I." Id. According to Delta, Plaintiff "attempts to masquerade her dismissed disability claim as a race claim by stating that Delta accommodated other white employees," but Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to show that any of the alleged comparator was similar to her in any way. Id. [*35]  at 20-21.
The Eleventh Circuit has explained that evidence that an employer "has treated like employees differently" is necessary to "supply the missing link and provide a valid basis for inferring unlawful discrimination" through use of the framework. Lewis v. City of Union City, 918 F.3d 1213, 1221-24 (11th Cir. 2019) (emphasis in original). While such a showing is generally made by showing disparate treatment of a comparator from outside the plaintiff's protected class, the Eleventh Circuit has nevertheless reiterated that a "plaintiff's failure to produce a comparator does not necessarily doom the plaintiff's case." Lewis v. City of Union City ("Lewis II"), 934 F.3d 1169, 1185 (11th Cir. 2019) (quoting Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011)). "Even without similarly situated comparators," a plaintiff can establish a valid claim if she can present a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence from which a factfinder can infer discriminatory motivation. Lewis II, 934 F.3d at 1185. This can "be shown by evidence that demonstrates, among other things, (1) 'suspicious timing, ambiguous statements . . ., and other bits and pieces from which an inference of discriminatory intent may be drawn,' (2) systematically better treatment of similarly situated employees, and (3) that the employer's justification is pretextual." Id. (quoting Silverman v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., 637 F.3d 729, 733-34 (7th Cir. 2011)). While the "convincing mosaic" method resembles the McDonnell [*36]  Douglas method, it operates as a totality-of-circumstances test rather than a rigid step-by-step analysis.
In this case, the Court agrees with Delta that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Delta discriminated against her because of her race when it allegedly terminated her employment in February of 2020. Plaintiff does not allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Delta treated any similarly situated non-Black employee more favorably than it treated her, nor does she allege sufficient facts to suggest a "convincing mosaic" of facts that could support a claim of race discrimination.
In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that, on or around August 28, 2018, Plaintiff "formally request[ed] a reasonable accommodation" by handing to Doe Manager a "doctor's release to work" "certificate" dated August 15, 2018, that had work restrictions. Compl. at ¶ 26. She alleges that Doe Manager believed that the August 15 note was "fake," "false," and "forged," and told her, "You ain't disabled, you being a LAZY ASS n****r, you just want to go back home for the rest of the summer to be a porch monkey, so you can be collecting welfare to smoke weed [*37]  and eat greasy fried chicken, chitlins, watermelon and a 40 ounce, and get bred by random n*****s fresh out of jail. That's all y'all do." Id. at ¶¶ 26, 28. She claims that Doe Manager then suspended her without pay. Id. at ¶ 30.
Plaintiff further alleges that, in or around early January of 2020, Plaintiff again reported to Nabors the alleged sexual and racial harassment she was subjected to by Cruz from 2012-2014, and also reported the alleged comments made by Doe Manager in 2017 and 2018, and his decision to suspend her without pay. Id. at ¶¶ 38-39. Plaintiff claims that Doe Manager eventually terminated Plaintiff's employment in or around February of 2020. Id. at ¶ 60 ("Because of DOE MANAGER's intentional racial discrimination against Plaintiff, Plaintiff suffered a materially adverse employment actions [sic], termination, in or around around [sic] February 2020.").
As Delta argues, Plaintiff expressly states in her Complaint that she was terminated for requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability, not because of her race. See id. at ¶ 57. While Plaintiff alleges that she was not provided an accommodation for her disability, "in contrast with similarly situated non-black [*38]  comparators," including "Jennifer Palmer, Joey   , Kimberly Ng, Patricia Beaver, [and] DOE MANAGER's wife," Plaintiff does not allege any facts supporting her conclusory allegation that any of these other individuals was similarly situated to her, such as whether they worked in the same department, whether they reported to the same supervisors, or whether they requested a similar accommodation. See id. at ¶ 57. Indeed, as noted below, Plaintiff's allegations show that Delta denied Plaintiff's requests on the specific basis that her purported restriction (to lifting more than 50 pounds repetitively) was not inconsistent with her job duties, which did not require such tasks. Plaintiff alleges no facts to show that the supposed comparators were allowed accommodations in remotely similar circumstances, that is, that any of them were also ramp agents who were permitted similar lifting accommodations that Plaintiff requested, and/or that any of these individuals were not terminated for refusing to return to work after being denied those accommodations.
Furthermore, as discussed, Plaintiff's claim that Delta failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability is being [*39]  litigated in the ADA Action, and her claim that she was terminated for requesting a reasonable accommodation has previously been dismissed in that action. The Court agrees with Delta that Plaintiff appears to be attempting to reassert that old claim in new clothes, with new and inconsistent factual allegations, which of course is the entire reason for the doctrine against claim-splitting.5 When reviewing Plaintiff's allegations in the ADA Action, it becomes clear that Plaintiff is not only impermissibly splitting her claims, but that her allegations establish that her termination was not related to discrimination against her because of her race.
In the ADA Action, Plaintiff alleges that, when she returned to work on August 27, 2018, she was asked by the "Lead in E Concourse" if she had any restrictions. SAC in the ADA Action at ¶ 84. When Plaintiff responded that she had a "lifting restriction," she was sent to the management offices. Id. at ¶ 85. Although Plaintiff was told that Delta did not have record of her doctor's release, the "misplaced note" was found and Plaintiff was sent home. Id. at ¶ 86.
Approximately thirty minutes after being sent home, Plaintiff received a [*40]  call from Khia Jones with Delta's Human Resources, who asked Plaintiff what the doctor's note said, to which Plaintiff responded that "she could not lift over 50 pounds repetitively." Id. at ¶¶ 87-88. Contrary to her allegations in this case that "Doe Manager" suspended her without pay, Plaintiff expressly alleges in the ADA Action that Jones told her (Plaintiff) that she could perform her job, because her duties did not require lifting more than 50 pounds repetitively. According to Plaintiff, Jones did not "suspend" Plaintiff but rather informed Plaintiff that her own ongoing refusal to report to work would be considered unapproved leave. Id. at ¶¶ 88-90. Moreover, Plaintiff alleges in the ADA Action that over a year went by after she was told to (but did not) return to work, and then on or about February 5, 2020, Plaintiff discovered that she was unable to log into "Deltanet," Delta's employee portal. Id. at ¶ 103. After reaching out to Delta's Tech Support, she was told that her access had been cut off because she had been terminated. Id. at ¶ 104.
Nowhere in Plaintiff's complaint in the ADA Action appeared any suggestion of "suspension" or her being told by any "manager" of termination, [*41]  or any statements related to the accommodations issue that included any racial references. To the contrary, Plaintiff was told that her restrictions did not impact her job duties, that she was considered to be on "unapproved" leave by virtue of her own decision not to report to work, and that she was removed from the employment rolls only after many months of continuing to remain on such unapproved leave. These facts are inconsistent with the events portrayed in the instant complaint and the allegation that her termination was based specifically on race.
In sum, when considering all of Plaintiff's allegations and sworn testimony in the ADA Action, as well as the Complaint in this action, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Delta discriminated against her because of her race when it terminated her employment in February of 2020. Accordingly, the Court finds that Count II of the Complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.
b. Retaliation
In Count III, Plaintiff asserts a claim of retaliation under § 1981, which encompasses claims of race-based retaliation. See CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553 U.S. 442, 445, 128 S. Ct. 1951, 170 L. Ed. 2d 864 (2008); Bryant v. Jones, 575 F.3d 1281, 1301 (11th Cir. 2009). As with claims of race discrimination, the elements [*42]  required to establish a claim of unlawful retaliation under § 1981 generally mirror those required for a claim of retaliation brought under Title VII. See Monaghan v. Worldpay US, Inc., 955 F.3d 855, 867 n.12 (11th Cir. 2020) ("The substantive standard governing retaliation claims brought under Title VII and § 1981 is the same in this Circuit.").
To state a plausible claim of illegal retaliation under Title VII or § 1981, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to show that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity or expression, such as filing an EEOC charge; (2) she received an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action. See Henderson v. City of Birmingham, Alabama, 826 F. App'x 736, 741 (11th Cir. 2020); Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1454 (11th Cir. 1998); Simmons v. Camden Cty. Bd. of Educ., 757 F.2d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 1985); see also Bowers v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 509 F. App'x 906, 910-12 (11th Cir. 2013) (acknowledging that each element need not be specifically pled for discrimination claim, but requiring causation element for retaliation claim).
To establish causation, a plaintiff is not required to establish "the sort of logical connection that would justify a prescription that the protected participation in fact prompted the adverse action. Such a connection would rise to the level of direct evidence of discrimination, shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendant." Simmons v. Camden Cty. Bd. of Educ., 757 F.2d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 1985); see also Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Pub. Co., 9 F.3d 913, 920 (11th Cir. 1993); Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc., 922 F.2d 1515, 1525 (11th Cir. 1991).
To establish a causal connection, a plaintiff was traditionally required to [*43]  show that the relevant decisionmaker was aware of the plaintiff's protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action "were not wholly unrelated." Shannon v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir. 2002) (internal citation and quotations omitted). The Supreme Court has ruled, however, that "Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation." Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013). This standard "requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer." Id.
To state a plausible claim of retaliation, a plaintiff must first allege sufficient facts to show that the relevant decision-makers involved in her termination were aware of and motivated by her protected activity. As the Eleventh Circuit has stated, this requirement "rests upon common sense. A decision-maker cannot have been motivated to retaliate by something unknown to him." Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000). The defendant's awareness of the protected statement, however, may ultimately be established by circumstantial evidence. Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, 996 F.2d 1155, 1163 (11th Cir. 1993).
Plaintiff's ultimate evidentiary burden is not yet at issue at this early juncture in the case. However, to state a claim, a plaintiff must at least plead sufficient facts [*44]  to allow a plausible inference of a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See, e.g., Tidwell v. Deloitte Consulting, LLP, No. 1:13-CV-4100-ODE-LTW, 2014 WL 12845595, at *4 (N.D. Ga. July 24, 2014), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:13-CV-4100-ODE-LTW, 2014 WL 12845611 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 18, 2014) (citing Bowers v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 509 F. App'x 906, 910-912 (11th Cir. 2013)). Courts have dismissed complaints of retaliation in the face of insufficient allegations of a specific decision-maker's knowledge or other facts allowing an inference of causation. See, e.,g., Uppal v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 482 F. App'x 394, 397 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) ("the allegations establish no causal relationship between the July 2008 letter that Dr. Uppal sent to the CEO, and the adverse employment actions taken by the hearing committee and the 'Defendant' in early 2009. Specifically, Dr. Uppal does not allege that the hearing committee was aware of the letter that she sent to the CEO.").
A plaintiff may establish an inference of causation merely by showing that she suffered the adverse action shortly after she engaged in the protected activity. See, e.g., Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir. 2004) ("A plaintiff satisfies this element [of causation] if she provides sufficient evidence of knowledge of the protected expression and that there was a close temporal proximity between this awareness and the adverse action."); see also Bass v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1119 (11th Cir. 2001); Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 (11th Cir. 2000). For a plaintiff to establish such a link by mere temporal relationship, however, [*45]  the challenged decision must follow very closely after the protected expression to support the logical inference that the two events were related. See Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) ("The cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be very close.") (internal quotes omitted). As the Eleventh Circuit has explained:
The burden of causation can be met by showing close temporal proximity between the statutorily protected activity and the adverse employment action. But mere temporal proximity, without more, must be "very close." A three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough. Thus, in the absence of other evidence tending to show causation, if there is a substantial delay between the protected expression and the adverse action, the complaint of retaliation fails as a matter of law.
Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal citations omitted); see also Gilliam v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affs., 822 F. App'x 985, 990 (11th Cir. 2020) (affirming dismissal in part because three-month delay between supervisor's discovery of protected activity and adverse employment [*46]  action was "too long to permit an inference of causation based on temporal proximity alone").
Delta argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim of retaliation under § 1981. See Def. Br. at 21-23. First, Delta argues, Plaintiff does not actually allege that she was terminated because of any race-based complaint. Second, Delta contends that Plaintiff's retaliation claim was previously dismissed in the ADA Action, but she is attempting to reassert her retaliation claim by inserting the word "race" to her claim. Finally, Delta argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to suggest an inference that her protected activity was causally linked to her eventual termination. See id. Based on a review of all of Plaintiff's allegations in the ADA Action and this action, the Court agrees with Delta that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for retaliation under § 1981.
As noted, Plaintiff alleges that Doe Manager suspended her without pay in 2018 and eventually terminated her employment in February of 2020 "for requesting a reasonable accommodation for Plaintiff's disability." Compl. at ¶ 57. Plaintiff previously [*47]  asserted a claim of retaliation in the ADA Action, but that claim was dismissed because Plaintiff had failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Delta retaliated against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability. While Plaintiff also alleges that, in early January of 2020, she reported to Nabors the alleged racist comments that Doe Manager made to her in 2018, she does not allege any facts suggesting that Doe Manager was ever aware that she had reported his comments to Nabors. See id. at ¶ 38. Without some facts suggesting that Doe Manager was aware of her alleged complaints about him, Plaintiff cannot state a plausible claim of retaliation.
Further, when reviewing Plaintiff's allegations in the ADA Action, it becomes clear that Plaintiff concedes that her termination was not related to retaliation against her because of her alleged complaints about Doe Manager. As noted above, in the ADA Action, Plaintiff concedes that she was told that she was on "unapproved leave" on August 27, 2018. After she did not return to her job at any time in 2018 and 2019, Plaintiff learned on February 5, 2020, when she attempted to log into "Deltanet," Delta's [*48]  employee portal, that she was unable to access her account, and Delta's Tech Support told her that her access had been cut off because she had been terminated.
In sum, when considering all of Plaintiff's allegations and testimony in the ADA Action, as well as the Complaint in this action, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Delta unlawfully retaliated against her for complaining about Doe Manager's racist comments when it terminated her employment in February of 2020. Accordingly, the Court finds that Count III of the Complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.
5. Plaintiff's Leave to Amend
As discussed, the undersigned finds that, as presently pleaded, the Plaintiff's § 1981 claims of race discrimination and retaliation would be subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim. The Eleventh Circuit has held, however, that when it appears that a pro se plaintiff's complaint, if more carefully drafted, might state a claim, the district court should usually give the pro se plaintiff one opportunity to amend her complaint instead of dismissing it. See Bank v. Pitt, 928 F.2d 1108, 1112 (11th Cir. 1991), overruled in part by Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir. 2002) (en banc).6
Arguably, the principles of Bank would not apply at all in this unique case, given that Plaintiff, far from being a novice plaintiff, has already filed and has been rigorously prosecuting the ADA Action in this Court. Indeed, Plaintiff has been specifically advised by the Court in the ADA Action as to the federal pleading standards in Iqbal and Twombly and the need to plead specific facts to meet the elements of each of her claims. See Non-Final Report and Recommendation [17] dated March 9, 2021, in the ADA Action. Moreover, as explained below, Delta has shown a strong likelihood that Plaintiff is not actually prosecuting this case herself but rather is receiving substantial unacknowledged assistance. In any event, whether these papers reflect Plaintiff's own work or that of a ghost writer, the record of this case and the ADA Action bespeak of a highly litigious and knowledgeable writer who has access to and liberally cites cases and legal principles. This is not a case, in other words, of a novice individual representing herself pro se.
Regardless, because all of Plaintiff's claims are barred by the claim-splitting doctrine, and the majority of her claims are clearly time-barred, [*50]  the Court finds that any amendment would be futile. For that reason, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Delta's Motion to Dismiss [17] be GRANTED, and that all of Plaintiff's claims against Delta be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim.
B. Delta's Motion for Sanctions
Delta has also filed a Motion for Sanctions [18]. Delta contends that, although Plaintiff has been proceeding pro se in this action, and has represented to the Court that she is personally signing all the documents filed in this case, Plaintiff has actually been allowing another individual to secretly prosecute the ADA Action as well as this case, including by drafting and filing materials and communications with the Court and opposing counsel. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's pleadings, briefs, and other documents are actually being drafted by "infamous non-lawyer vexatious litigator Aasir Azzarmi," and Delta seeks sanctions against Plaintiff and Azzarmi. Def. Br. [18-1] at 1. Delta requests that Plaintiff and Azzarmi be held in civil contempt for violating the Court's Order in the ADA Action, and requests that Azzarmi "be referred for review for federal criminal prosecution for obstruction of justice, unauthorized practice [*51]  of law, and other possible crimes with respect to these lawsuits." Id. at 3-4.
Sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including dismissal, may be imposed against an attorney or a party who files a pleading that (1) has no reasonable legal basis; (2) has no reasonable factual basis; or (3) is filed for an improper purpose. Thomas v. Evans, 880 F.2d 1235, 1239 (11th Cir.1989). The purpose of Rule 11 is to "'discourage dilatory or abusive tactics and help to streamline the litigation process by lessening frivolous claims or defenses.'" Id. (quoting Rule 11's advisory committee note). Although Rule 11 applies to pro se plaintiffs, the court must take into account a plaintiff's pro se status when it determines whether the filing was reasonable. Id. at 1240.
There is no doubt that Plaintiff's actions in the ADA Action and this case have been troubling, and Delta has shown that there is a strong likelihood that Plaintiff has been receiving assistance in drafting the documents in both the ADA Action and this case. Delta previously filed a Motion for Sanctions [61] in the ADA Action, and, in the Non-Final Report and Recommendation recommending denial of that motion, the undersigned discussed some of those issues and concerns. See Order and Non-Final Report and Recommendation [69] at 6-15, [*52]  in the ADA Action.
In particular, the undersigned noted that, although Plaintiff represented in the ADA Action that she has "never worked with, seen, spoken to, communicated with or ever met this person named Aasir Azzarmi at any time in [her] life," and "I DO NOT KNOW THIS PERSON," Plaintiff offered no explanation as to why she has included Azzarmi on her witness list attached to her Initial Disclosures if she does not know him and has never spoken to him or communicated with him in any way. See Pl. Aff., attached to Pl. Br. [65] at 15-17 in the ADA Action; Pl. Initial Disclosures, Att. A [43] at 5, in the ADA Action.
Plaintiff's responses during her deposition in the ADA Action even more directly show a likely violation of Rule 11 in this case. See Pl. Dep. [98] in the ADA Action. Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this action on September 8, 2022, and she was deposed in the ADA Action was less than two months later, on November 30, 2022. Nevertheless, when Plaintiff was asked about her claims in this case, she had no idea what they were, or what this case was about. See id. at 168-70 (when Plaintiff was asked if she had filed any other lawsuit against Delta, she stated, "I believe so," but [*53]  when asked when she filed the lawsuit, she responded, "I don't recall," and when asked if she could recall what the lawsuit was about or what the legal claims were, she responded, "Not at the moment.").
The extraordinary record in this case includes many examples pointed out by Delta raising significant suspicions of bad faith and improper "ghost writing" in these cases. But the closest thing there can be to a smoking gun is the Plaintiff's complete lack of awareness of the claims and facts alleged in this very lawsuit that she herself purported to file, pro se. The Court has not been eager to reach the issue of sanctions, as it is loath to resolve cases other than on the evidentiary merits except when absolutely and clearly warranted. The Court remains loath to do so, which is why it rests primarily on the Plaintiff's failure to state a claim in recommending dismissal. But the Court at this point cannot overlook, among the many other red flags in this record, the Plaintiff's lack of knowledge of this very lawsuit that she supposedly filed. The Court is convinced that she did not prepare and file these papers, that she has no basis to support the factual validity of the allegations, [*54]  and the filing of this case (likely by another, but with Plaintiff's apparent acquiescence) was for the improper and bad faith purpose of harassing Delta.7 Thus, the Court is forced to recommend that dismissal also be based on sanctions for bad faith and vexatious litigation and violations of Rule 11.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Delta's Motion for Sanctions [18] be GRANTED and that this case be dismissed for that additional reason.
C. Plaintiff's Claims against Individual Defendants
As noted, Plaintiff has asserted her § 1981 claims in this case against three individuals: Kelly Nabors and Khia Jones, both Human Resources Managers for Delta; and "Doe Manager," a Delta Ramp Manager (the "Individual Defendants"). Although Plaintiff filed this action on September 8, 2022, as of this date, the Individual Defendants have not entered an appearance and it appears that they have not been properly served with a copy of the summons and Complaint.
At the time of filing the Complaint, Plaintiff filed an Application to Proceed in District Court without Prepaying Fees or Costs [1], which was granted on September 9, 2022. See Order [2]. The Court advised Plaintiff that, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d), officers of the [*55]  court are charged with issuing and effecting service of process. See Order [2] at 1-2. Plaintiff was ordered to complete the USM 285 form, summons, and the initial disclosures form for each Defendant, and to return those forms to the Clerk, for service of process. Id. at 2. When Plaintiff completed the summons forms, however, she included an address for Delta's registered agent for service on Nabors and Jones. See Plaintiff's proposed Summons forms [6]. Further, although the docket reflects that service was attempted on Nabors on December 16, 2022, the Proof of Service indicates that service was made on an individual named "Barry Smith" of Corporation Service Company. See Proof of Service [19].
Rule 4(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that service on an individual be made by following state law for serving a summons; delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the individual personally; leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the individual's dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there; or delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e). Plaintiff has not shown that [*56]  Delta's registered agent is "authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process" on behalf of Nabors or Jones. Thus, it appears that, as of this date, none of the Individual Defendants has been properly served according to the requirements of Rule 4.
Rule 4(m) provides that, if service of the summons and complaint is not made on a defendant within 90 days after the filing of the Complaint, the court must dismiss the action without prejudice or order that service be made within a specified time. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). Because Plaintiff in this case is proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, and officers of the Court are charged with serving the Defendants, the Court would ordinarily give her another opportunity to complete the USM 285 form and summons for Nabors and Jones with their proper addresses for service. In this case, however, because Plaintiff has failed to state a plausible claim for relief against any of the Individual Defendants, the undersigned recommends that Plaintiff's claims against them be dismissed.
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2), a federal court is required to dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint at any time if the court determines that the allegation of poverty is untrue, or that the action (1) [*57]  is frivolous or malicious, (2) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted, or (3) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. Thus, a court must "sua sponte dismiss [an indigent non-prisoner's] complaint or any portion thereof which is frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim, or seeks damages from defendants who are immune." Robert v. Garrett, No. 3:07-cv-625, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58810, 2007 WL 2320064, at *1 (M.D. Ala. Aug. 10, 2007); see also 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)-(iii).
The purpose of § 1915(e)(2) is "to discourage the filing of, and waste of judicial and private resources upon, baseless lawsuits that paying litigants generally do not initiate because of the costs of bringing suit and because of the threat of sanctions for bringing vexatious suits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11." Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S. Ct. 1827, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1989). A dismissal pursuant to § 1915(e)(2) may be made sua sponte by the Court prior to the issuance of process, so as to spare prospective defendants the inconvenience and expense of answering frivolous complaints. Id. at 324.
A claim is frivolous under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) "where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact." Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 325; see also Napier v. Preslicka, 314 F.3d 528, 531 (11th Cir. 2002); Bilal v. Driver, 251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir. 2001). In other words, a complaint is frivolous when it "has little or no chance of success"—for example, when it appears "from the face of the complaint that the factual allegations are clearly baseless[,] the legal theories are indisputably [*58]  meritless," or "seeks to enforce a right that clearly does not exist." Carroll v. Gross, 984 F.2d 392, 393 (11th Cir. 1993) (internal quotations omitted); see Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327. Claims premised on allegations that are "fanciful" or "fantastic" are subject to dismissal for frivolity. Denton v. Hernandez, 504 U.S. 25, 32, 112 S. Ct. 1728, 118 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1992) (quoting Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 325).
A plaintiff fails to state a claim under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) "when the facts as pleaded do not state a claim for relief that is 'plausible on its face.'" Thompson v. Fernandez Rundle, 393 F. App'x 675, 678 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)). Moreover, § 1915 "accords judges not only the authority to dismiss a claim based on an indisputably meritless legal theory, but also the unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint's factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions are clearly baseless." Bilal, 251 F.3d at 1349 (quoting Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327).
When reviewing whether a complaint states a claim under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), the Court applies the same standards that apply on review of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Evans v. Ga. Regional Hosp., 850 F.3d 1248, 1253 (11th Cir. 2017). Thus, as stated above, to survive the Court's sua sponte dismissal, a complaint "must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)).
In this case, the Court finds that Plaintiff's claims against the Individual Defendants should be dismissed for all of the reasons discussed above as to Delta, including for improper [*59]  claim splitting and for failure to state a claim under § 1981. With respect to Nabors and Jones, Plaintiff does not allege any facts indicating that either of them took any actions against her within the relevant time period that Plaintiff claims was discriminatory or retaliatory. With respect to Plaintiff's claims against "Doe Manager," Plaintiff has filed no motion to amend the Complaint to include the Defendant's real name, although Plaintiff has already had months of discovery in the ADA Action to discover his name.
Plaintiff alleges that, on an unspecified date in or around 2012, Plaintiff reported to Nabors that she "objectively and subjectively believed that because of her race, that Plaintiff was working in a severely hostile work environment," but Nabors "did not promptly investigate or [take] any remedial action" against Cruz. Compl. at ¶¶ 42-43. She alleges further that, from 2012 to 2014, when she made "formal complaints" to Nabors, Nabors threatened Plaintiff with suspension without pay and termination if Plaintiff filed any complaint with the EEOC. Id. at ¶ 49. Plaintiff also alleges that, on or around August 28, 2018, Plaintiff reported Doe Manager's alleged comments and suspension [*60]  of her to Jones, and Jones told Plaintiff that Doe Manager was the "final decision maker" with respect to Plaintiff's suspension, and there is "[n]othing I can do about it." Id. at ¶ 31. As discussed, however, any claims based on events prior to September 8, 2018, are untimely.
The only factual allegation that relates to Nabors or Jones after September 8, 2018, is Plaintiff's allegation that, in January of 2020, she again reported to Nabors the alleged sexual and racial harassment she was subjected to by Cruz from 2012-2014, and also reported the alleged comments made by Doe Manager in 2017 and 2018, and his decision to suspend her without pay. Id. at ¶¶ 38-39. But Plaintiff fails to allege any facts suggesting that either Nabors or Jones took any adverse employment action against her within the relevant time period. Instead, Plaintiff alleges that it was "Doe Manager" who suspended her and then terminated her employment in or around February of 2020. Id. at ¶ 60 ("Because of DOE MANAGER's intentional racial discrimination against Plaintiff, Plaintiff suffered a materially adverse employment actions [sic], termination, in or around around [sic] February 2020."). For that reason, Plaintiff [*61]  has failed to state a claim for relief under § 1981 against either Nabors or Jones, and her claims against them must be dismissed.
With respect to Plaintiff's allegations against Doe Manager, "[a]s a general matter, fictitious-party pleading is not permitted in federal court." Richardson v. Johnson, 598 F.3d 734, 738 (11th Cir. 2010). There is "a limited exception to this rule when the plaintiff's description of the defendant is so specific as to be 'at the very worst, surplusage.'" Id. (quoting Dean v. Barber, 951 F.2d 1210, 1215-16 (11th Cir. 1992)). In other words, "[i]t is important to distinguish suing fictitious parties from real parties sued under a fictitious name." Dean, 951 F.2d at 1215-16 (quotations and citations omitted). A claim may be stated against an unnamed defendant when the allegations in the complaint make clear the plaintiff could uncover the name of the defendant during discovery. Bowens v. Superintendent of Miami South Beach Police Dep't, 557 F. App'x 857, 862 (11th Cir. 2014).
Plaintiff identifies "Doe Manager" as a "white male" and a Delta Ramp Manager at Delta's airport in Atlanta. Compl. at ¶ 7. She further alleges that, on or around August 28, 2018, after Plaintiff gave Doe Manager a "doctor's release to work" dated August 15, 2018, that had work restrictions, Doe Manager made racist comments to her, and then suspended her without pay. Id. at ¶¶ 26, 28, 30. She also alleges that Doe Manager [*62]  terminated her employment in February of 2020. Id. at ¶ 60.
While Plaintiff's description of Doe Manager would appear to be specific enough for the Court to find that she would be able to uncover his name during discovery, under the very unusual circumstances presented in this case, it is clear that Plaintiff has failed to do so in this case, although she has engaged in discovery in the ADA Action that should have allowed her to uncover the name of the mysterious "Doe Manager." In connection with the ADA Action, the parties have completed discovery, and summary judgment motions are pending. In particular, the Court notes that Plaintiff was deposed in the ADA Action on November 30, 2022, and testified under oath that she spoke to two individuals named Chris Holt and Tom Glaushas at Delta in or around August 27 and 28, 2018, and even recorded her conversations with them. See Pl. Dep. [98] in the ADA Action, at 37-40. Plaintiff described Glaushas as a "manager" and Holt as a "lead customer service agent." Id. at 35-36. Plaintiff also submitted a Declaration [95] in the ADA Action dated January 9, 2023, in which she states that, on August 28, 2018, she provided her "doctor's release" to [*63]  Chris Holt, but Holt informed her that she was "suspended without pay." See Pl. Decl. [95] at 9, 37, in the ADA Action.
In sum, although Plaintiff has had months of discovery in the ADA Action, and has submitted a Declaration in which she claims that Chris Holt was the person who allegedly suspended her without pay, Plaintiff has not filed any motion in this action to correct the name of "Doe Manager" to Chris Holt, Tom Glaushas, or any other individual employed by Delta. Thus, allowing Plaintiff an opportunity to engage in discovery in this case solely for the purpose of allowing her to uncover the real name of "Doe Manager" would appear to be entirely futile. For that reason, the undersigned recommends that Plaintiff's claims against "Doe Manager" be dismissed for failure to state a claim.

III. RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons discussed, IT IS RECOMMENDED that Delta's Motion to Dismiss [17] be GRANTED, and that all of Plaintiff's claims against Delta be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim.
IT IS FURTHER RECOMMENDED that Delta's Motion for Sanctions [18] be GRANTED.
IT IS FURTHER RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's claims against the Individual Defendants, Kelly Nabors, Khia Jones, and "Doe [*64]  Manager," be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim, and that the Complaint be DISMISSED in its entirety.
As this is a Final Report and Recommendation, there is nothing further in this action pending before the undersigned. Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 19th day of July, 2023.
