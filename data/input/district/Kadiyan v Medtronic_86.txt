Opinion


ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPERT WITNESS FEES AND DIRECTING PARTIES TO SUBMIT ADDITIONAL BRIEFING REGARDING WORK PERFORMED BY DEFENDANT'S ATTORNEYS
Armine Kadiyan filed this action in Los Angeles Superior Court on August 13, 2009.1 The complaint pled five claims related to plaintiff's employment with defendant Medtronic, Inc.: (1) violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"); (2) breach of express and implied employment contract; (3) disability discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (4) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and (5) failure to pay wages in violation of California Labor Code § 200 November 6, 2011 et seq.2 Kadiyan dismissed her unpaid wage claim on July 26, 2010.3 On August 10, 2010, Medtronic removed the action to this court, invoking the court's diversity [*2]  jurisdiction.4 It moved for summary judgment on December 21, 2010.5 The court granted that motion as to all remaining claims on April 8, 2011.6 Medtronic filed a motion for attorneys' fees and expert witness fees shortly thereafter,7 which Kadiyan has opposed.8

I. DISCUSSION

A. Defendant's Motion for Fees under FEHA
Medtronic seeks an award of attorneys' fees and expert witness fees under California Government Code § 12965, which provides, in relevant part, that "the court, in its discretion, may award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney's fees and costs, including expert witness fees." In Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 98 S. Ct. 694, 54 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1978), the Supreme Court developed the standard that governs fee awards to prevailing FEHA defendants. Jersey v. John Muir Medical Center, 97 Cal.App.4th 814, 831, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 807 (2002) (stating that the standard governing attorneys' fees awards against losing FEHA plaintiffs is "the same as under federal civil rights legislation as articulated in Christiansburg," citing Cummings v. Benco Building Servs., 11 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1386-87, 15 Cal. Rptr. 2d 53 (1992)). The Christiansburg Court held that, unlike a prevailing plaintiff, who "ordinarily is to be awarded attorney's fees in all but special circumstances," a prevailing defendant is entitled to a fee award on a more limited basis. It stated:
"[A] district court may in its discretion award attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case upon [*3]  a finding that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith. . . . In applying these criteria, it is important that a district court resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation. This kind of hindsight logic could discourage all but the most airtight claims, for seldom can a prospective plaintiff be sure of ultimate success." Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 418, 421-22.
Thus, fees should be awarded to prevailing defendants only in "exceptional cases." Mitchell v. Office of the Los Angeles Co. Sup't of Schools, 805 F.2d 844, 846-47 (9th Cir. 1986); see also Saman v. Robbins, 173 F.3d 1150, 1157 (9th Cir. 1999) ("'Attorneys' fees in civil rights cases should only be awarded to a defendant in exceptional circumstances,'" quoting Barry v. Fowler, 902 F.2d 770, 773 (9th Cir. 1990)); John Muir Medical Center, 97 Cal.App.4th at 830 ("Attorney fees should be awarded to a prevailing defendant only where the action brought is found to be unreasonable, frivolous, meritless or vexatious, and the term 'meritless' is to be understood as meaning groundless or without foundation, rather than simply that the plaintiff has ultimately lost his case," quoting Cummings, 11 Cal.App.4th at 1387 (quotation marks omitted)). "[T]he court must assess whether the plaintiff could reasonably have believed [*4]  that he or she had an adequate basis in law and fact to pursue the claim." Moosa v. Dolan Foster Enterprises, No. 95-03099 MHP, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8609, 1998 WL 30060, *4 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 1998) (emphasis original); Cummings, 11 Cal.App.4th at 1389 (stating that a review of federal discrimination cases indicates that a prevailing defendant may be awarded attorneys' fees where "the plaintiff's conduct was egregious or . . . his or her case was patently baseless for objective reasons").
Applying this standard, courts have awarded fees to defendants where, inter alia, a plaintiff "knew or should have known that his case was without foundation" because "[his] charges had been investigated and rejected by the California Labor Commission, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, Miller v. Los Angeles County Board of Ed., 827 F.2d 617, 620 (9th Cir. 1987); because there was 'no evidence of racial discrimination," Harris v. Plastics Mfg. Co., 617 F.2d 438, 440 (5th Cir. 1980) (per curiam); or because the discrimination claim "was pressed in the face of overwhelming factual evidence that showed that [defendant], its personnel, and the union acted on nondiscriminatory bases," Fisher v. Fasion Inst. of Technology, 491 F.Supp. 879, 888 (S.D.N.Y. 1980). Courts have noted that, although a plaintiff may initially articulate a colorable claim, a "nonfrivolous action [may be] shown through discovery to be . . . without factual basis." Moosa, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8609, 1998 WL 30060 at *7. As a result, [*5]  attorneys' fees awarded to a prevailing defendant "need not cover the entire period of the case, but may be limited to the period after events demonstrate that plaintiff's case was frivolous, unreasonable[,] or groundless." Id. (citing Moss v. Associated Press, 956 F.Supp. 891, 896 (C.D. Cal. 1996)).
Additionally, recognizing that frivolous claims can be joined with non-frivolous claims, the Ninth Circuit has held that courts may award partial fees to defendants for time spent defending against frivolous claims, even if no fees are awarded for non-frivolous causes of action. See Tutor-Saliba Corp. v. City of Hailey, 452 F.3d 1055, 1064 (9th Cir. 2006) (agreeing with the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion that "it would undermine the intent of Congress to allow plaintiffs to prosecute frivolous claims without consequences merely because those claims were joined with unsuccessful claims that were not frivolous," quoting Quintana v. Jenne, 414 F.3d 1306, 1312 (11th Cir. 2005)). Accordingly, the court evaluates separately each of the claims for which Medtronic contends it is entitled to recover fees.

1. Kadiyan's Discrimination Claim
Medtronic contends it is entitled to fees for litigation of Kadiyan's discrimination claim because the court found Kadiyan's direct evidence of discrimination (negative comments by her supervisor, Jing Mageary,9 about her time off) and indirect evidence [*6]  of discrimination (the timing of her alleged termination) insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.10 The fact that the court entered summary judgment in Medtronic's favor does not demonstrate that Kadiyan's action was per se frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. An action is not necessarily frivolous or meritless simply because a defendant obtains summary judgment on all of plaintiff's claims. See, e.g., Bruce v. City of Gainsville, Georgia, 177 F.3d 949, 950 (11th Cir. 1999) (affirming summary judgment in favor of an ADA defendant, but holding that it was not entitled to attorneys' fees because "[t]o be deemed 'meritless' for purposes of assessing a prevailing defendant's attorney's fees, it is not enough that the plaintiff . . . ultimately lost his case"); Patton v. County of Kings, 857 F.2d 1379, 1381 (9th Cir. 1988) ("The mere fact that a defendant prevails does not automatically support an award of fees").
Under FEHA, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discrimination by offering direct evidence of discriminatory intent or proffering evidence that satisfies the multi-part test articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 640 (9th Cir. 2004). Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff must show that "(1) [s]he is a member of a protected class; (2) [s]he was qualified for [her] position; (3) [s]he experienced [*7]  an adverse employment action; and (4) similarly situated individuals outside [her] protected class were treated more favorably, or other circumstances surrounding the adverse employment action give rise to an inference of discrimination." See Peterson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 358 F.3d 599, 603 (9th Cir. 2004).
As direct evidence of discrimination, Kadiyan relied on negative comments allegedly made by Mageary about the leave Kadiyan took to care for her ailing mother. The court found this evidence insufficient to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, noting that the alleged comments did not address Kadiyan's psychiatric disability and, in fact, occurred months before Kadiyan informed anyone at Medtronic that she suffered from bipolar disorder.11 As California courts have recognized, however, the fact that a plaintiff is able to adduce only weak, if any, direct evidence of discrimination is not surprising. Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal.4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) ("This so-called McDonnell Douglas test reflects the principle that direct evidence of intentional discrimination is rare, and that such claims must usually be proved circumstantially").
In addition to contending that she possessed direct evidence of discrimination, Kadiyan attempted to make out a prima facie case under the McDonnell-Douglas [*8]  framework. Medtronic did not dispute that Kadiyan, as a person with a disability, was a member of a protected class or that she was performing competently in her position at Medtronic before taking leave. It argued, however, that Kadiyan was still employed at Medtronic and thus had not suffered an adverse employment action.12 The court did not find this argument persuasive, concluding that Kadiyan had introduced sufficient evidence to raise triable issues as to whether she had been terminated. It thus declined to enter summary judgment in Medtronic's favor on this ground.13
The court did, however, find Kadiyan's evidence inadequate to prove the fourth element of a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas. This element requires proof that "similarly situated individuals outside [plaintiff's] protected class were treated more favorably, or [that] other circumstances surrounding the adverse employment action give rise to an inference of discrimination." Peterson, 358 F.3d at 603. Kadiyan proffered no evidence concerning the treatment of similarly-situated Medtronic employees.14 Instead, she relied on the timing of her purported termination, which came six months after she advised the company of her disability. The court [*9]  concluded that this length of time was too attenuated, standing alone, to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination.15 While the court's conclusion is supported by case law,16 a six-month period is not so lengthy that it was unreasonable for Kadiyan to believe it would be sufficient to support her claim. Moosa, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8609, 1998 WL 30060 at *4. Because Kadiyan adduced sufficient evidence to prove three of the four elements necessary to make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination, and because the evidence she adduced to prove the fourth element was not patently frivolous, the court cannot conclude that Kadiyan's disability discrimination claim was meritless such that an award of fees is appropriate.
A case cited by Kadiyan is instructive in this regard.17 In Villanueva v. City of Colton, 160 Cal.App.4th 1188, 73 Cal. Rptr. 3d 343 (2008), the appellate court affirmed the trial court's award of attorneys' fees to defendant; it noted, however, that the trial judge had been presented with "overwhelming evidence that the lawsuit was unfounded, unreasonable, and frivolous." Id. at 1201. The trial judge had
"found that the action was in fact 'unreasonable, frivolous and meritless. . . . While [Villanueva] submitted his own and other declarations [*10]  in opposition to the motion, those declarations, and the exhibits appended thereto, once stripped of argument, conjecture and other inadmissible content left a dearth of information upon which a reasonable person could possibly advance a colorable claim for employment discrimination. [Villanueva's] deposition testimony . . . [spoke] volumes in this regard. While it appears that [Villanueva was] apparently a disgruntled employee, th[e trial] court [found that] there [was] no evidence, substantial or otherwise to support the claims advanced.'" Id. at 1200.
Here, by contrast, while the court found that Kadiyan was ultimately unable to carry her burden of proof on the fourth element of her prima facie case, it did not find that Kadiyan relied heavily on inadmissible evidence and conjecture, or that she could not reasonably have believed that she had stated a colorable claim. Rather, th* court concluded that Kadiyan had carried her burden as to three of the four elements of a prima facie case. As a result, the court concludes that Kadiyan's disability discrimination claim was not frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.

2. Kadiyan's Retaliation Claim
Medtronic next argues that it is entitled to [*11]  the attorneys' fees and expert fees it incurred defending against Kadiyan's unsuccessful claim that the company retaliated against her in violation of FEHA.18 Under FEHA, it an unlawful employment practice for an employer "to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed . . . practices forbidden under [FEHA] or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under [FEHA]." CAL. GOV'T CODE § 12940(h). The court concluded that the activity that allegedly provided the basis for the retaliation claim — taking CFRA leave — was not protected under FEHA.19 Kadiyan, moreover, proffered no evidence that she had filed a complaint, testified, participated in a FEHA proceeding, or engaged in any analogous activity.
As the court noted when granting summary judgment on the claim, however, Kadiyan's FEHA retaliation claim was closely linked to her CFRA retaliation claim.20 Courts have held that different legal theories concerning the same allegedly wrongful conduct should not be evaluated in isolation when determining whether an award of fees is appropriate. John Muir Medical Center, 97 Cal.App.4th at 832 ("While plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence of sex discrimination or of the other motivations [*12]  to which her counsel has adverted in defending the second cause of action, it is apparent that this cause of action was merely an attempt to articulate a different legal theory to support her contention that defendant acted wrongfully in discharging her for proceeding with her sexual battery claim against the hospital patient. Whether plaintiff's claim was so groundless as to warrant attorney fees against her must be evaluated with respect to her entire complaint, not simply the FEHA cause of action"); Delaney v. Superior Fast Freight, 14 Cal.App.4th 590, 600, 18 Cal. Rptr. 2d 33 (1993) ("Although it has long been the law in California that a claim of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation could not be made under the FEHA Delaney sought relief as well under other theories. A civil action is based upon the injury to the plaintiff, and not any particular legal theory" (citation omitted)). As explained in more detail below, Kadiyan's CFRA retaliation claim was not frivolous and does not justify an award of fees. Because the FEHA retaliation claim was essentially a duplicate of Kadiyan's CFRA retaliation claim, the court concludes that it would be inappropriate to award Medtronics the fees it incurred defending against it.21

3. Kadiyan's Failure to [*13]  Engage in the Interactive Process Claim
Medtronic also contends that Kadiyan frivolously alleged that it failed to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA. Under FEHA, an employer must, upon request by an employee "with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition," engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process to determine effective, reasonable accommodations, if any. CAL. GOV'T CODE § 12940(n). In such cases, "[l]iability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown of communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal.App.4th 34, 62 n. 22, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006).
There is no dispute that Kadiyan had a "known disability" that triggered FEHA obligations, nor that she informed Medtronic of her condition.22 The court concluded, however, that Kadiyan had failed to raise triable issues concerning Medtronic's actions, since she had "proferred no evidence [that] at the time of her alleged termination . . . she had requested any additional accommodation."23 In her opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Kadiyan asserted that she was "surprised when defendants suddenly and unilaterally removed her from her position and terminated [*14]  her employment."24 This was apparently a reference to Kadiyan's claim that Medtronic informed her that she was terminated only a week before the date on which she had told the company she could return to work, a point about which she offered testimony.25 From this, Kadiyan reasonably could have believed that she had raised a triable issue of fact about whether Medtronic had failed to engage in the interactive process in good faith. The fact that this was not the case does not make the claim frivolous.

4. Kadiyan's Failure to Accommodate Claim
The same holds true for Medtronic's argument that Kadiyan's failure to accommodate claim warrants an award of attorneys' fees. While the court concluded that Kadiyan had failed to raise triable issues of fact concerning Medtronic's alleged failure to accommodate,26 she proffered evidence that other billers could have performed her job until her return.27 She also asserted that Medtronic failed to offer her assistance in seeking a new job at the company,28 and evidence that prior to the date she was terminated, she told Medtronic her physician had cleared her to return to work in a week. Kadiyan argued that Medtronic could have accommodated her by leaving [*15]  the position open for one more week.29 This evidence was not sufficient to create a triable issue of fact, but was not so "patently baseless for objective reasons" as to justify an award of fees. Cummings, 11 Cal.App.4th at 1389.

5. Kadiyan's CFRA claim
The CFRA, California Government Code § 12945.2, entitles employees to "[l]eave to care for a parent or a spouse who has a serious health condition," or to address "an employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of that employee." CAL. GOV'T CODE § 12945.2 (c)(3)(B)-(C). It is unlawful for an employer "to refuse to hire, or to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, or discriminate against" an individual exercising his or her right to family care and medical leave. Id., § 12945.2(c)(1).
To prove a prima facie case of retailiation in violation of the CFRA, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) the defendant was an employer covered by the CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take the CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, fine, or suspension, because of her exercise of her right to CFRA leave." Dudley v. Dep't of Transp., 90 Cal.App.4th 255, 261, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 739(2001); see also  [*16] Houston v. Regents of Univ. of California, C 04-4443 PJH, 2006 WL 1141238, *33 (N.D. Cal. May 1, 2006) (reciting the elements set forth in Dudley).
In its motion for summary judgment, Medtronic did not dispute that it is an employer subject to the CFRA, that Kadiyan was an employee eligible for leave, or that Kadiyan exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose.30 Although Medtronic argued that Kadiyan had not been terminated, the court concluded, as noted above, that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that Kadiyan had been subjected to adverse employment action.31 As it did with the FEHA discrimination claim, however, the court found that the period between the start of Kadiyan's intermittent CFRA leave and her alleged termination was too attenuated to create a triable issue of fact regarding the causal connection between the termination and her protected conduct.32 It similarly found that the negative comments allegedly made by Kadiyan's supervisor about her decision to take CFRA leave were too far removed from the date of her alleged termination, too equivocal, and too unrelated to the personnel decision making process to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether she was terminated in retaliation for taking leave.33
As with Kadiyan's disability [*17]  discrimination claim, the fact that summary judgment was granted does not compel the conclusion that the claim was frivolous. Kadiyan adduced sufficient evidence to raise triable issues of fact regarding three of the four elements of a prima facie case of CFRA retaliation. Kadiyan could reasonably have believed that her testimony about Mageary's criticism raised triable issues about Medtronic's compliance with the CFRA. As a result, Kadiyan's CFRA retaliation claim was not frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation.

6. Kadiyan's Wrongful Termination Claim
Medtronic correctly acknowledges that Kadiyan's wrongful termination claim was "derivative of her FEHA claims."34 Kadiyan argued that her termination violated the public policy that favors permitting employees to take medical and disability leave.35 The court granted summary judgment, concluding that Kadiyan's wrongful termination failed for the same reason as her CFRA claim.36 Because Kadiyan's CFRA claim was not frivolous, her wrongful termination claim similarly was not, and Medtronic is not entitled to attorneys' fees or expert witness fees on the claim.

7. Kadiyan's Harassment Claims
Kadiyan's FEHA and CFRA harassment claims, which [*18]  she voluntarily dismissed on July 27, 2010, have also prompted a request by Medtronic for fees.37 As the California Supreme Court has made clear, "'harassment [is] . . . conduct [that is] not necessary for performance of a supervisory job. Instead, [it is] . . . conduct outside the scope of necessary job performance, conduct presumably engaged in for personal gratification, because of meanness or bigotry, or for other personal motives. Harassment is not conduct of a type necessary for management of the employer's business or performance of the supervisory employee's job.'" Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal.4th 640, 646-47, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333 (1998) (quoting Janken v. GM Hughes Elecs., 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 62-63, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996).
To prevail on her harassment/hostile work environment claims, Kadiyan was required to demonstrate that defendants' conduct "was severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create a work environment that qualifies as hostile or abusive to employees" based on physical disability. Miller v. Dep't of Corr., 36 Cal.4th 446, 462, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 115 P.3d 77 (2005) (describing a hostile work environment arising out of sexual harassment, and citing Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., 21 Cal.4th 121, 130, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 132, 980 P.2d 846 (1999), and Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)); see also Hope v. California Youth Auth., 134 Cal.App.4th 577, 588, 36 Cal. Rptr. 3d 154 (2005) (describing the test in the context of sexual orientation discrimination); Clark v. KMart Corp., No. 2:10-cv-04047-JHN-PJWx, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115120, 2010 WL 4235852, *2 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 18, 2010).
Kadiyan adduced no evidence that she was harassed for taking disability leave. [*19]  Mageary's statements did not relate to Kadiyan's disability and, as noted, were allegedly made months before Kayidan informed anyone at Medtronic that she was disabled. Additionally, because Kadiyan alleged only that she was criticized for taking leave, the conduct she denominated harassment was inextricably tied to personnel decisions that are unavoidable in the workplace and that cannot constitute harassment as a matter of law. Reno, 18 Cal.4th at 656 ("Making a personnel decision is conduct of a type fundamentally different from the type of conduct that constitutes harassment. Harassment claims are based on a type of conduct that is avoidable and unnecessary to job performance. No supervisory employee needs to use slurs or derogatory drawings, to physically interfere with freedom of movement, to engage in unwanted sexual advances, etc., in order to carry out the legitimate objectives of personnel management. Every supervisory employee can insulate himself or herself from claims of harassment by refraining from such conduct. An individual supervisory employee cannot, however, refrain from engaging in the type of conduct which could later give rise to a discrimination claim. Making personnel decisions is [*20]  an inherent and unavoidable part of the supervisory function"). Even more fundamentally, Kadiyan neither alleged nor adduced evidence of conduct that was so severe or pervasive that it altered the conditions of her employment and create a work hostile or abusive environment. At most, she alleged that certain isolated comments were made about her decision to take leave. Despite this fact — a fact that must have been well known to Kadiyan and her attorneys when the suit was filed — she prosecuted her harassment claims for almost a year before dismissing them. The court is compelled to conclude that Kadiyan's harassment claims were groundless, and that Medtronic is entitled to an award of the attorneys' fees it expended defending against them.
The fact that Kadiyan's harassment claims were frivolous, however, does not entitle Medtronic to payment of all of the attorneys' fees it incurred during the case. Kadiyan voluntarily dismissed the harassment claims on July 27, 2010. Medtronic is thus entitled to fees only for the period during which Kadiyan continued to pursue the claims. Moosa, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8609, 1998 WL 30060 at *8. Even before she dismissed the harassment claims, moreover, they were only a fraction of the claims to which [*21]  Medtronic's attorneys undoubtedly devoted time. The court cannot determine with precision how much time Medtronic's attorneys devoted to defending the harassment claims, since the time sheets they have proffered do not include this level of detail.38 To assist the court in determining the amount of fees to which Medtronic is entitled, it directs Medtronic to file a supplemental pleading no later than January 20, 2012 detailing the attorney time and costs it incurred defending Kadiyan's harassment claims. Time that was spent partially defending those claims and defending other claims as to which the court has not awarded fees should not be included. Kadiyan may file a response on or before February 3, 2012.

B. Defendant's Motion for Attorneys' Fees on the Unpaid Wages Claim
Medtronic also seeks attorneys' fees under California Labor Code § 218.5. That statute provides: "In any action brought for the nonpayment of wages, fringe benefits, or health and welfare or pension fund contributions, the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party if any party to the action requests attorney's fees and costs upon the initiation of the action." As the statute's language suggests, awarding attorneys' [*22]  fees is mandatory if there was a request for fees at the commencement of the case. Drumm v. Morningstar, Inc., 695 F.Supp.2d 1014, 1018 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (quoting Earley v. Superior Court, 79 Cal.App.4th 1420, 1427, 95 Cal. Rptr. 2d 57 (2000)).
Kadiyan sought attorneys' fees when she initiated the action.39 She voluntarily dismissed her wage claim on July 27, 2010,40 making Medtronic the "prevailing party" on that claim. See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1032(4) ("'Prevailing party' includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant" (emphasis added)); Cano v. Glover, 143 Cal.App.4th 326, 331, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 871 (2006) ("A defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered is the prevailing party and is entitled to costs. This is true where the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses or where the trial court orders an involuntary dismissal. Defendant is entitled to costs regardless of whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice" (citations and quotation marks omitted)); Catello v. I.T.T. General Controls, 152 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1013 n. 4, 200 Cal. Rptr. 4 (1984) ("'Dismissal' within the meaning of section 1032 includes voluntary dismissal" (citation omitted)).41
Kadiyan contends that she "should not be penalized" for dismissing the claim, given that her decision "resulted in fewer claims . . . than before."42 As noted, however, the wording [*23]  of the statute is mandatory, and must be applied according to its terms. Kadiyan also appears to argue that awarding fees to Medtronic for the dismissed wage claim is inappropriate because her "entire Complaint, not any particular abandonment" must be considered frivolous before defendant is entitled to fees.43 Kadiyan implicitly asserts that a defendant prevailing on a wage claim and seeking attorneys' fees must satisfy the Christiansburg standard if the losing plaintiff has also alleged FEHA claims in the action. Addressing this issue, the court in Villabos v. Guertin, No. CIV. S-07-2778 LKK/GGH, 2009 WL 4718721 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 3, 2009), concluded that "Christiansburg's holding was predicated on the fact that Title VII grants courts discretion to award fees," while California Labor Code § 218.5 dictates that a fee award is mandatory. As a consequence, the court concluded, Christiansburg's requirements cannot be engrafted onto it. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118763, [WL] at *3 ("It appears that no published California case, nor any federal case, has held that when a claim is of a type encompassed by section 218.5, a party must show anything more than that it has prevailed to be entitled to a mandatory award of fees"). The court agrees, and concludes that Medtronic has met its burden of showing an entitlement to fees under [*24]  Labor Code § 218.5.
This does not mean, however, that Medtronic can recover the fees and costs it incurred defending the entire action under § 218.5. See Drumm, 695 F.Supp.2d at 1024. As with Kadiyan's harassment claims, Kadiyan voluntarily dismissed her unpaid wages claim before the case was removed to federal court; even before the claim was dismissed, it was only one of several to which Medtronic's attorneys devoted time. The wages claim, moreover, would appear to have been substantively discrete from the remaining claims. To assist the court in determining the amount of fees to which Medtronic is entitled under Labor Code § 218.5, the court directs Medtronic to detail in its supplemental pleading the attorneys' fees and costs it incurred defending Kadiyan's wage claim. Kadiyan may contest Medtronic's apportionment in its response.

C. Defendant's Motion for Expert Fees Based on Plaintiff's Failure to Accept a Settlement Offer
Medtronic seeks an award of expert witness fees under California Code of Civil Procedure 998(c)(1), which provides:
"If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award, the plaintiff shall not recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay [*25]  the defendant's costs from the time of the offer. In addition, in any action or proceeding other than an eminent domain action, the court or arbitrator, in its discretion, may require the plaintiff to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses, who are not regular employees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both, preparation for trial or arbitration, or during trial or arbitration, of the case by the defendant."
In exercising its discretion, the court takes into consideration the fact that Medtronic incurred the expert witness fees in a FEHA case. Holman v. Altana Pharma US, Inc., 186 Cal.App.4th 262, 280, 111 Cal. Rptr. 3d 554 (2010), is instructive in evaluating the interplay between California Government Code § 12965 and California Code of Civil Procedure § 998(c). There, the court analyzed a trial court's decision to award expert witness fees to a prevailing FEHA defendant. Id. at 277-78. It concluded that Code of Civil Procedure § 998(c) does not require that the Christiansburg standard be met before awarding a prevailing FEHA defendant expert witness fees. Id. at 281-83. The court cited approvingly, however, earlier case law noting that "Christiansburg and subsequent cases 'demonstrated sensitivity to the imbalance inherent in allowing equal cost-s[h]ifting between unequal [*26]  parties' and the risk that shifting substantial litigation expenses 'to what ordinarily are modest- or low-income individuals would unduly discourage [such] plaintiffs from litigating legitimate claims.'" Id. at 283 (citing Seever v. Copley Press, Inc., 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1562, 47 Cal. Rptr. 3d 206 (2006)). These cases stand in some tension with Code of Civil Procedure § 998(c), which is designed " to create economic incentives on both parties to settle rather than try their lawsuits." Id. at 283; Seever, 141 Cal.App.4th at 1562. To balance the goals of both statutes, the Holman court found it appropriate "and indeed necessary for trial courts to 'scale' those awards downward to a figure that will not unduly pressure modest- or low-income plaintiffs into accepting unreasonable offers." Holman, 186 Cal.App.4th at 284 (quoting Seever, 141 Cal.App.4th at 1562).
On May 21, 2010, Medtronic sent Kadiyan's counsel an offer to settle the case for $75,000; Kadiyan did not respond.44 Given the weakness of Kadiyan's case, which ultimately resulted in the entry of judgment in Medtronic's favor, Medtronic's offer was reasonable. Kadiyan, however, is the type of modest-income plaintiff that FEHA was designed to protect. Her monthly income while employed at Medtronic was $3,167.45 Since her employment at Medtronic ended, she has not found work and has received unemployment benefits.46 Her future employment [*27]  options will likely involve clerical or billing work that will offer similarly modest pay.47 Requiring Kadiyan to pay more than a fraction of the $24,675 that Medtronic expended on expert witness fees would potentially deter legitimate claims by plaintiffs like her. This is precisely the risk recognized in Holman and Seever.
While recognizing Kadiyan's limited financial means and the burden that paying Medtronic's expert witness fees may place on her, the court is also cognizant of the fact that Code of Civil Procedure § 998(c) is effective only if "both sides . . . face some economic consequences if it turns out they miscalculate and lose. Thus, seldom would a court properly deny a successful defendant its entire 998 cost award, even in a FEHA case." Seever, 141 Cal.App.4th at 1562. Accordingly, the court concludes that Medtronic is entitled to $1,000 in expert witness fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 998(c). Additionally, Medtronic will likely be entitled to an award of fees once it adduces more definitive evidence of the work performed on Kadiyan's unpaid wages and harassment claims. In combination, the three awards will adequately fulfill California Code of Civil Procedure § 998(c)'s purpose of encouraging prompt settlement without [*28]  damaging FEHA's goal of limiting the risk that low-income plaintiffs will have to pay the expert witness fees of a larger, wealthier parties.

II. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated, the court finds that most of Kadiyan's claims were not frivolous. Because it concludes that Kadiyan's harassment claims were frivolous, however, Medtronic is entitled to an award of the fees it reasonably incurred defending those claims. Medtronic's request for attorneys' fees on Kadyian's unpaid wages claim is also granted. The court awards Medtronic $1,000 in expert witness fees pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 998(c). The court directs Medtronic to file a supplemental pleading no later than January 20, 2012 detailing the attorneys' fees it incurred defending Kadiyan's unpaid wages and harassment claims. Kadiyan may file a response on or before February 3, 2012. The court recognizes that it may not be easy to separate work Medtronic's lawyers performed defending Kadiyan's unpaid wages and harassment claims from work they undertook to defend Kadiyan's other claims. See Drumm, 695 F.Supp.2d at 1024 -26. To the extent that certain litigation activities were necessary both to defend claims for which Medtronic is entitled to attorneys' [*29]  fees and to defend those for which it is not, Medtronic is directed to explain in its pleading the methodology it used to apportion fees, and to provide legal support for its methodology. Kadiyan can dispute the apportionment and provide contrary legal authority in her responsive pleading.
