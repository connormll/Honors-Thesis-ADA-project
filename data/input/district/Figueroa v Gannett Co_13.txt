Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Before the Court are two motions, Defendants Gannett Co., Inc. and TNI Partners' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 45) and Plaintiff Natalie Figueroa's Motion for Summary Judgement (Doc. 48). The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Rateau for all pretrial proceedings and report and recommendation in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and L.R.Civ.P. 72.1 and 72.2 (Docs. 14, 15). The Court has reviewed the record and oral argument on the motions was heard on July 21, 2020. For the reasons discussed below, the Court recommends that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment be granted in part and denied in part and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment be denied.

I. Complaint and Procedural [*2]  Background
Plaintiff initially filed the Complaint in state court and the Defendants removed the case to federal court based on federal question jurisdiction (based on Plaintiff's ADA claim). In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she commenced her employment with the Arizona Daily Star in 1989 and was working as a product design tech/planner when she was terminated on June 21, 2018. She alleges that she was terminated based on her disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, and the Arizona Civil Rights Act ("ACRA"), A.R.S. § 41-1463. She also alleges that her termination was in retaliation for the filing of a claim under Arizona's workers' compensation laws and was therefore wrongful under the Arizona Employment Protection Act ("AEPA"), A.R.S. § 23-1501.
In their Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 45), Defendants request judgment be entered in their favor on all of Plaintiff's claims. In her Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 48), Plaintiff requests judgment in her favor on her claims under the ADA.

II. Factual Background
The Arizona Daily Star is a daily newspaper that serves Tucson and southern Arizona. (Defendants' Statement of Facts ("DSOF"), ¶ 1.) The Daily Star is owned by TNI Partners, [*3]  Inc. ("TNI"), and TNI is a partnership between Lee Enterprises and Gannett Co., Inc. (DSOF, ¶ 1.)
Plaintiff began working for TNI in 1989 as a print design technician. (Plaintiff's Statement of Facts in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment ("PSOF"), ¶ 1.) On December 15, 1992, Plaintiff suffered an on-the-job injury and underwent spine fusion surgery before returning to work. The injury was aggravated requiring a second back surgery and, in 1995, the Industrial Commission of Arizona awarded a permanent disability. (PSOF, ¶ 2.) Although still impaired and needing leaves of absence in 1993 and 1995, Plaintiff eventually returned to work and continued in her job as a production design technician for another 20-plus years. (DSOF, ¶ 2; PSOF, ¶ 2.)
In 2014 or 2015, Plaintiff sought to reopen her workers' compensation claim to obtain payments for medical care and doctor visits. Plaintiff believed that certain managers did not like her because of her workers' compensation claim. However, by 2014, the managers she identified were no longer working for TNI. (DSOF, ¶ 5.) After 2014, Plaintiff did not feel that she was treated any differently because she had filed a workers' compensation [*4]  claim. (DSOF, ¶ 6.)
As of Spring 2017, Plaintiff was working for TNI as a print design technician, assisting with product design and paper planning for the Arizona Daily Star's sections and publications. Her duties included both clerical and manual work. On a computer, Plaintiff laid out the daily paper and processed print jobs for commercial clients. The manual requirements of the job are related to the plate making process which requires Plaintiff to load plates in and out of the machine, lay them out to check their accuracy, stack them together, and hang them on the wall. Depending on the day, Plaintiff could spend 30% to 70% of her time in the plate room. Overall, the job required moderate to frequent carrying, lifting, pulling, and/or pushing of up to 40 pounds. (DSOF, ¶ 8.)
On March 17, 2017, Plaintiff notified her supervisor, Felipe Lundin, that her doctor advised her that she needed to be off work for 30 days. Lundin directed her to contact MetLife, TNI's third-party benefits administrator, and MetLife approved Plaintiff's FMLA leave and short-term disability benefits ("STD") through April 14. (DSOF, ¶¶ 3, 9; PSOF, ¶¶ 3, 13.) During this time, Plaintiff also applied for Social [*5]  Security Disability benefits. (DSOF, ¶ 10; PSOF, ¶ 13.)
Shortly before her scheduled return on April 17, 2017, Plaintiff notified Lundin that she had another doctor's note excusing her from work through mid-May. Lundin told Plaintiff that she needed to process her extension request through MetLife. (DSOF, ¶ 12.) On May 8, TNI received notice of Plaintiff's approved leave extension through May 16. (DSOF, ¶ 13.) On May 15, Plaintiff contacted Lundin and told him that her doctor had again extended her leave. (DSOF, ¶ 15.) Lundin reminded Plaintiff that TNI needed paperwork from MetLife approving her leave extension. (DSOF, ¶ 16.) TNI never received documentation from MetLife; nevertheless, it allowed Plaintiff to take the time off and continued to pay her. (DSOF, ¶ 17.)
On June 8, 2017, Plaintiff unexpectedly returned to work with a doctor's release outlining her return-to-work restrictions. (DSOF, ¶ 18; PSOF, ¶ 4.) The release that Plaintiff provided contained the following terms:
Clerical/modified work: Lifting the knees (with a straight back, no stooping) not more than 5 lbs [2 kg] up to 3 time/hr; squatting up to 4 time/hr; standing or walking with a 5-minute break at least every 20 [*6]  minutes; sitting with a 5-minute break every 30 minutes; no extremes of extension or flexion; no extremes of twisting; no climbing ladders; driving car only up to 2 hrs/day.
Manual work: Lifting with knees (with a straight back) not more than 25 lbs [11 kg] up to 15 times/hr; squatting up to 16 times/hr; standing or walking with a 10-minute break at least every 1-2 hours; sitting with a 10-minute break every 1-2 hours; extremes of flexion or extension allowed up to 12 times/hr; extremes of twisting allowed up to 16 times/hr; climbing ladders allowed up to 25 rungs 6 time/hr; driving car or light truck up to a full work day; driving heavy truck up to 4 hrs/day.
(DSOF, ¶ 19; PSOF, ¶ 4.)
TNI concluded that the release was too ambiguous to accept and told Plaintiff to remain off work while it considered the release. (DSOF, ¶ 20; PSOF ¶ 5.) On June 9, 2017, John Lundgren, Director of Print Operations, spoke with Plaintiff and notified her that the release was under further review by Human Resources and that TNI would get back to her. (DSOF, ¶ 21; PSOF, ¶ 5.)
After obtaining Plaintiff's job description, Human Resources Business Partner Lisa Cote contacted Plaintiff's doctor's office, on June [*7]  13, to clarify what accommodations Plaintiff actually needed. (DSOF, ¶ 22.) On June 19, TNI received an updated release from Plaintiff's doctor's office that accounted for Plaintiff's job description. Cote was out of the office when she received the updated return-to-work release from Plaintiff's doctor's office. (DSOF, ¶ 23.)
On June 20, Cote informed Lundin and Lundgren that Plaintiff's doctor had provided an updated release which contained the manual restrictions as previously written but removed the clerical/modified work restrictions. (DSOF, ¶ 24.) Cote, Lundin, and Lundgren met to discuss the release and determined that, with the revised restrictions, TNI could accommodate Plaintiff's return to work. Lundin was instructed to contact Plaintiff and inform her that she could return to work. (DSOF, ¶ 25.)
After being instructed to advise Plaintiff to return to work, Lundin called Plaintiff, informed her that TNI obtained an updated release, and told her to return to work on June 21 at 10 a.m. (DSOF, ¶ 26.) This is where the parties' versions of events diverge. Lundin recalls that Plaintiff indicated that she intended to pursue SSDI benefits and that Social Security told her that would [*8]  lose her claim if she returned to work. (DSOF, ¶ 27.) Given that statement, Lundin requested that Plaintiff provide documentation stating she would not return to work, and Plaintiff indicated she would do so at 10 a.m. on June 21. (DSOF, ¶ 28.) Lundin then reported the conversation to Lundgren and Cote. He explained that Plaintiff had informed him that she was pursuing SSDI benefits, that Social Security told her not to return to work because she would lose her benefits, and that she was going to follow Social Security's instructions. (DSOF, ¶ 29.)
Given Plaintiff's statements, TNI determined that, on June 20, Plaintiff had resigned her employment. However, Plaintiff did not arrive at TNI at 10 a.m. on June 21. Cote therefore instructed Lundin to call Plaintiff to reiterate that TNI accepted her resignation. When he did so, Plaintiff repeated her statement from the previous day, stating again that she did not want to lose her Social Security claim. Lundin then reiterated that TNI accepted her resignation. (DSOF, ¶¶ 30, 31, 32.) At that point, Plaintiff indicated that she was 15 minutes away and did not want to lose her job. Lundin suggested that Plaintiff talk to Human Resources, but she declined. [*9]  (DSOF ¶ 33.)
Lundin reported his conversation with Plaintiff to Cote in Human Resources. (DSOF, ¶ 34.) Cote then confirmed with Lundin what Plaintiff had told him on June 20 (that she would not return because it would affect her SSDI claim) and then contacted Plaintiff. (DSOF, ¶¶ 35, 36.) Cote reports that Plaintiff confirmed her prior statements to Lundin about not wanting to jeopardize her SSDI claim and Cote confirmed that Plaintiff had resigned.
Plaintiff's recollection of events differs. She recalls Lundin calling on June 20 to tell her she was approved to return to work but only subject to one of her doctor's restrictions. Because Lundin was unable to explain any other information about the change to her work restrictions, Plaintiff told him that she would call her doctor about the change and notify Social Security that she was returning to work. (PSOF, ¶ 7.) On June 21, Plaintiff notified Social Security that she intended to return to work and attempted to reach her doctor. However, on her way to work that day, Lundin telephoned, telling her that she had been terminated and not to appear at work. (PSOF, ¶ 8.) She denies that she ever informed TNI that she intended to pursue SSDI [*10]  benefits. (PSOF, ¶ 9.) She admits that she applied for disability and SSDI benefits in March 2017, but understood that both Social Security and MetLife "encouraged her to return to her job, if possible." (PSOF, ¶ 13.)
Beginning in March 2017, Plaintiff several times represented to Social Security and MetLife that she was unable to work. (DSOF, ¶¶ 39-43.) Since leaving TNI's employ, Plaintiff has not looked for employment and considers herself disabled. (DSOF, ¶ 44.) Effective September 2017, Plaintiff was approved for long-term disability ("LTD") benefits through MetLife. At that time her STD benefits rolled over to LTD benefits which Plaintiff continues to receive. (DSOF, ¶ 45.) Additionally, at the hearing on the motions, Plaintiff's counsel informed the Court that Plaintiff's SSDI claim was recently approved.

III. Legal Standard
Under Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate when: (1) the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact; and (2) after viewing the evidence most favorably to the non-moving party, the movant is entitled to prevail as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Eisenberg v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 815 F.2d 1285, 1288-89 (9th Cir. 1987). Under this standard, "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under governing [*11]  [substantive] law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A "genuine issue" of material fact arises only "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Id.
In considering a motion for summary judgment, a court's function is not to determine "the truth of the matter" by conducting a "trial on affidavits." Id. at 249, 255. Rather, the court's role is to determine "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury." Id. at 251-52. Accordingly, all justifiable evidentiary inferences are to be made in the nonmovant's favor, leaving "[c]credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts" to the jury. Id. at 255; accord Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). If the court finds that a reasonable jury could determine "either that the plaintiff proved his case . . . or that he did not," then it should deny summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 254.

IV. Analysis

A. ADA Claim
Both parties seek summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim under the ADA. The ADA provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to . . . discharge [*12]  of employees . . . and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff must prove that: (1) she is "disabled" within the meaning of the ADA; (2) she is a qualified individual with a disability; and (3) she was subject to an adverse employment action based on her disability. Menchaca v. Maricopa Comm. College Dist., 595 F. Supp. 2d 1063, 1067 (D. Ariz. 2009).
If an ADA plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, "the burden shifts to the defendant to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment action." Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 50, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003). A defendant is not required to persuade the Court that an employment action was "actually motivated by the proffered reasons." Tex. Dep't of Cmty Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). Rather, a defendant need only provide evidence that raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55. Once an employer offers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate the employer's articulated reason is a pretext for disability discrimination. Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1093 (9th Cir. 2001).

1. Has Plaintiff established a prima facie case?

a. Was Plaintiff a "qualified individual" under the ADA?
The parties' first dispute is whether Plaintiff satisfies [*13]  the second element of the prima facie ADA discrimination test.
An ADA plaintiff bears the burden of proving that she is a "qualified individual with a disability"—that is, a person "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions" of her job. A totally disabled person who cannot "perform the essential functions of the employment position" with or without reasonable accommodations thus cannot be a "qualified individual" entitled to sue under Title I of the Act.
Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 198 F.3d 1104, 1108 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999) & 42 U.S.C. § 12111). If a plaintiff was totally disabled, there can be "no genuine issue [of fact] that she could have performed her job with the proposed, or any other, accommodation." Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1482 (9th Cir. 1996).
Relying primarily on Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999), Defendants contend that no genuine dispute of material fact exists as to the question of whether Plaintiff is "qualified" under the ADA because all of the probative evidence shows that she is not. Specifically, Defendant cites Plaintiff's statements as to her inability to work, the statements of her doctors, and Plaintiff's representations in connection with her applications for SSDI and LTD benefits as evidence of Plaintiff's total disability. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff is estopped [*14]  from testifying she is able to work by her statements to the contrary to obtain disability benefits from his insurer and the Social Security Administration.
In Cleveland, the Supreme Court considered whether an employee who had applied for SSDI benefits and claimed to be disabled was then precluded from pursuing an ADA claim requiring she prove she was a "qualified individual" who could perform the essential functions of her job with or without accommodations. 526 U.S. at 806. Examining the issue under judicial estoppel principles, the Court concluded that an employee's application for SSDI benefits would not be an absolute bar to a claim under the ADA. Id. The Court explained:
Summary judgment for a defendant is appropriate when the plaintiff "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [her] case, and on which [she] will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). An ADA plaintiff bears the burden of proving that she is a "qualified individual with a disability"—that is, a person "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions" of her job. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). And a plaintiff's sworn assertion in an application for disability benefits that she [*15]  is, for example, "unable to work" will appear to negate an essential element of her ADA case—at least if she does not offer a sufficient explanation. For that reason, we hold that an ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier SSDI total disability claim. Rather, she must proffer a sufficient explanation.
526 U.S. at 805-06. The Court further explained that a plaintiff may not "simply ignore the apparent contradiction or attempt to create an issue of fact "simply by contradicting his or her own previous sworn statement (by, say, filing a later affidavit that flatly contradicts that party's earlier sworn deposition) without explaining the contradiction or attempting to resolve the disparity." Id. at 806. The Court remanded the case, offering the following guidance to the trial courts:
When faced with a plaintiff's previous sworn statement asserting "total disability" or the like, the court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary elements of an ADA claim. To defeat summary judgment, that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff's good-faith belief in, [*16]  the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless "perform the essential functions" of her job, with or without "reasonable accommodation."
Id. at 807. The Ninth Circuit has also applied Cleveland's guidance where, as here, a plaintiff had applied LTD benefits. See Smith v. Clark Cty Sch. Dist., 727 F.3d 950, (9th Cir. 2013); see also Instructions for Field Offices Analyzing ADA Charges After Supreme Court Decisions Addressing "Disability" and "Qualified", 1999 WL 33305880, at *13 (EEOC Guidance 1999) (instructing field offices to apply Cleveland guidance to ADA cases involving claims of disability not only for purposes of SSDI benefits, but also LTD and workers' compensation benefits).
Turning to the facts of this case, Defendants accurately note that Plaintiff has repeatedly represented that she is unable to work. She testified at her deposition that she has not sought employment because her physical condition has not allowed her to do so. (DSOF, ¶ 44.) Plaintiff also applied for and obtained STD and LTD benefits from MetLife understanding that a prerequisite to obtaining those benefits was her inability to work. (DSOF, ¶¶ 39, 45.) In one application provided to MetLife, Plaintiff stated that she was "unable to work/disabled" and that two doctors had certified her inability to work. (DSOF, [*17]  ¶ 43.) Plaintiff also agreed with a Social Security physician's determination that she was unable to work. (DSOF, ¶ 40).
In response, Plaintiff does not disagree that a conflict exists, but argues that she repeatedly made it clear that she believed herself capable of performing the essential functions of her job. Supporting her contention is her deposition testimony wherein she states that she was not claiming to be totally disabled and "tried going back to work and [TNI] did not allow me to go back to work." She also testified that with the restrictions identified by her doctor, she knew she could perform her job and stated, "I am not saying I'm totally disabled," and that "[i]f they gave me the same job that I know I can do, I would probably take it in a heartbeat." (DSOF, Ex. C, p. 143.) Bolstering these assertions is a statement made in her application for LTD benefits submitted to MetLife. There, when asked if she could return to her job if accommodations were made, Plaintiff responded, "I made attempts to return to work on 6/8/17 [and] Restrictions on "Return To Work" form were removed by doctor (upon) Gannett's request." (DSOF, Ex. C (Plaintiff's Deposition), Att. 4 (MetLife [*18]  Application)).
The question is whether these statements are sufficient to explain away Plaintiff's assertions that she was disabled for purposes of SSDI and LTD benefits. "Cleveland's sufficient-explanation standard is not an exceedingly demanding one." Smith v. Clark Cty Sch. Dist., 727 F.3d at 958. This case presents a very close question, however, because Plaintiff has offered an explanation that a reasonable trier of fact might find sufficient. For this reason, summary judgment in favor of Defendants on this issue is not appropriate. See, e.g., Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 335 (2nd Cir. 2000) (finding, inter alia, that plaintiff's statement that he was "entitled . . . to long-term disability benefits once he was being denied the opportunity to work" adequately explained the contradiction between his statements to insurer and those made in support of his ADA claim) (emphasis added).

b. Did Plaintiff suffer an "adverse employment action?"
Assuming Plaintiff meets her prima facie burden of establishing that she is a qualified individual with a disability, she must also show that she was subject to an adverse employment action based on her disability. Menchaca, 595 F. Supp. 2d at 1067. An adverse employment action is one which "materially affects the compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." [*19]  Davis v. Team Elec. Co., 520 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2008).
Defendants contend that Plaintiff voluntarily resigned from her position with TNI. Without a claim of constructive discharge, an employee's voluntary resignation does not constitute an adverse employment action. See, e.g., Miller v. Praxair, Inc., 408 F.App'x 408, 410-11 (2d Cir. 2010) (voluntary resignation under circumstances not amounting to constructive discharge or hostile work environment did not constitute adverse employment action); Gallagher v. Sunrise Assisted Living of Haverford, 268 F.Supp.2d 436, 442 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (granting summary judgment on retaliation claim because plaintiff "fail[ed] to offer evidence of an adverse employer decision" as she "resigned and was not terminated."). Plaintiff denies ever saying anything that could be fairly construed as a resignation and contends that she was terminated. While Defendants assert that Plaintiff told Lundin, her supervisor, that she intended to pursue SSDI benefits and would not be returning to work, Plaintiff contends that Lundin called her on June 20 to inform her that she was authorized to return to work, but subject only to the revised restrictions that Defendants obtained from Plaintiff's doctor. (PSOF, ¶ 7.) Plaintiff says she sought to clarify the change in her work restrictions and notified Social Security that she intended to return to work. Before she could do [*20]  so, however, Lundin called her on June 21 to inform her she had been terminated. (PSOF, ¶ 8.) Plaintiff additionally points out that the Defendants failed to document or confirm her alleged resignation on June 20 and did not use the word "resignation" until June 21. Because the parties' factual recollections of the events leading to Plaintiff's separation from employment, a question of fact exists regarding whether Plaintiff voluntarily resigned or was terminated. Thus, this issue of fact that must be resolved by the fact-finder.

2. Is TNI's claim of Plaintiff's resignation pretextual?
Assuming Plaintiff can establish her prima facie case, "the burden shifts to the defendant to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment action." Hernandez, 540 U.S. at 50 (2003). A defendant is not required to persuade the Court that an employment action was "actually motivated by the proffered reasons." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254. Rather, a defendant need only provide evidence that raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff. Id. at 254-55. Once an employer offers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate the employer's articulated [*21]  reason is a pretext for disability discrimination. Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1093 (9th Cir. 2001).
Here, as its legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff, TNI again points to Plaintiff's resignation. TNI notes that Plaintiff was initially accommodated in March 2017 when she was given time off. (DSOF, ¶¶ 9, 13, 14, 17.) Then, when faced with an arguably contradictory release, TNI worked to clarify the release by providing Plaintiff's job description to her doctor. (DSOF, ¶¶ 20-23.) Then, when TNI informed Plaintiff that it could accommodate her return to work, Plaintiff, according to TNI, resigned from her position. TNI contends that Plaintiff's resignation is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's separation from TNI and notes that courts "only require that an employer honestly believed its reasons for its actions, even if its reason is foolish or trivial or even baseless." Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1063 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Johnson v. Nordstrom, Inc., 260 F.3d 727, 733 (7th Cir. 2001)); see also Paolino v. US Airways, Inc., No. CV-14-01672-PHX-NVW, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8771, 2016 WL 304640 (D. Ariz. Jan. 26, 2016) ("the only thing that mattered was the sincerity of the employer's belief — not its accuracy").
Again, however, Plaintiff contends she never resigned and that TNI's claim otherwise is pretextual. As proof of pretext, Plaintiff relies on a summary prepared [*22]  by her attorney and emails written by TNI employees at the time of her separation from TNI. See PSOF, ¶ 14, Ex. 3. There, she contends, Defendants failed to document or confirm that she had resigned and admit that the word "resignation" was not used until Lundin called her on June 21, 2017, to tell her that her "resignation had been accepted."
Because the issue of Plaintiff's resignation is disputed, the factual resolution of the issue is appropriately left to the fact-finder. A reasonable fact-finder could believe the testimony of Lundin regarding Plaintiff's resignation and find TNI's decision to accept the resignation as legitimate and non-discriminatory. Also, even if Plaintiff never resigned, a fact-finder could determine that TNI's belief that she had resigned was sincere, even if inaccurate. Alternatively, a fact-finder could conclude that Plaintiff had not resigned her position and that TNI's reliance on her alleged resignation was illegitimate. As such, if Plaintiff is found to satisfy her prima facie case, this issue should be left to the fact-finder for resolution.

3. Did TNI fail to accommodate and engage in the interactive process?
In Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137-38 (9th Cir. 2001), the Ninth Circuit opined that:
Once [*23]  an employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation, that employer has a mandatory obligation under the ADA to engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify and implement appropriate reasonable accommodations. An appropriate reasonable accommodation must be effective in enabling the employee to perform the duties of the position. The interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees, and neither side can delay or obstruct the process. [Employers], who fail to engage in the interactive process in good faith, face liability for the remedies imposed by the statute if a reasonable accommodation would have been possible.
Id. at 1137-38.
TNI contends that its history of accommodating Plaintiff, including providing her paid time off in March through mid-May 2017, paying her while she was not covered by STD benefits, and especially in light of the level of accommodation it had provided in the past, undercut any claim of discrimination. TNI additionally points out that it sought clarification of Plaintiff's limitations from her doctor, but rather than dialoging, Plaintiff resigned.
Plaintiff contends [*24]  that TNI utterly failed to engage in the interactive process as evidenced by its failure to discuss with her (1) the essential functions of her job; (2) her view of her capabilities; or (3) her view of any necessary accommodation to allow her to perform the essential functions of her job. (PSOF, ¶ 6.) Plaintiff further alleges that TNI actively undermined her by telling her doctor that her job involved no clerical duties, thus prompting him to delete those limitations from the work release provided by the doctor to TNI. (PSOF, ¶ 12.)
While much of the evidence suggests that TNI accommodated Plaintiff and was engaged in the interactive process, a fact-finder could reasonably determine that TNI's characterization of the separation as a resignation amounted to a withdrawal from the interactive process. Thus, once again, if Plaintiff can show that she was a qualified individual, this question is not one that could readily be resolved on summary judgment.

B. ACRA Claim
To the extent that Plaintiff alleges a parallel claim under the ACRA, Arizona courts have held that the ACRA is "generally identical" to the applicable provisions of the ADA, and thus federal case law is persuasive in interpreting [*25]  the ACRA. Bodett v. CoxCom, Inc., 366 F.3d 736, 742 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Vitto v. Cent. Parking Corp., 103 F.App'x 202, 203 n.1 (9th Cir. 2004). Thus, for the reasons discussed above in relation to Plaintiff's ADA claims, neither Plaintiff nor Defendants is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's ACRA claims.

C. Arizona Employment Protection Act Claim
The Arizona Employment Protection Act ("AEPA") bars discharging an employee in retaliation for an employee exercising her rights under the workers' compensation statutes. A.R.S. § 23-1501(3)(c)(iii). To establish a prima facie case of workers' compensation retaliation, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Whitmire v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 359 F.Supp.3d 761, 796 (D. Ariz. 2019).
Plaintiff filed her workers' compensation claim in 1992 and requested additional benefits in 2014-15. She characterizes the years from the first filing of the claim as a "battle over . . . industrial benefits" with TNI's intent to separate her from employment in 2017. Temporal proximity between a plaintiff's engagement in a protected activity and suffering an adverse employment action can evidence a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Villiarimo, 281 F.3d at 1065. However, when she [*26]  was placed on non-work status in 2017, more than a year had passed since the last activity related to her workers' compensation claim. Additionally, at her deposition, Plaintiff testified that, after 2014, TNI or her managers did not treat her differently because she had filed a workers' compensation claim. (DSOF, ¶¶ 5, 6.) These considerations make it impossible to see how a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that TNI retaliated against her for the filing of the claim.

V. RECOMMENDATION
Based on the foregoing, the Magistrate Judge RECOMMENDS that the District Court, after its independent review, grant in part and deny in part Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 45), denying the motion as to Plaintiff's ADA claims and granting the motion on Plaintiff's AEPA retaliation claim. The Magistrate Judge also RECOMMENDS that the District Court deny Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 48).
This Recommendation is not an order that is immediately appealable to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Any notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 4(a)(1), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, should not be filed until entry of the District Court's judgment.
However, the parties shall have fourteen days from the date of service of a copy [*27]  of this recommendation within which to file specific written objections with the District Court. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Rules 72(b), 6(a) and 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thereafter, the parties have fourteen days within which to file a response to the objections. Replies shall not be filed without first obtaining leave to do so from the District Court. If any objections are filed, this action should be designated case number: CV 19-0022-TUC-CKJ. Failure to timely file objections to any factual or legal determination of the Magistrate Judge may be considered a waiver of a party's right to de novo consideration of the issues. See United States v. Reyna-Tapia, 328 F.3d 1114, 1121 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc).
Dated this 11th day of August, 2020.
/s/ Jacqueline M. Rateau
Honorable Jacqueline M. Rateau
United States Magistrate Judge
