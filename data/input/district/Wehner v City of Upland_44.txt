Final Rulings on: (1) City of Upland's Motion to Dismiss, (2) Upland Animal Shelter's Motion to Dismiss, and (3) Motion to Strike

I. Background1
 [*2] This case arises out of plaintiff Michael Wehner's arrest by defendant City of Upland's (the "City") police officers. Wehner claims he suffers from several mental impairments and relied on his purportedly trained service dog "Travis" to help cope with those conditions. SAC ¶¶ 6, 11-15. He alleges that upon his arrest, the officers illegally seized Travis. According to Wehner, he was not provided an opportunity to contest the seizure. By the time he was released from detention, the City's animal shelter had given Travis away for adoption. Wehner initially brought this Section 1983 action with related claims against the City and Friends of Upland Animal Shelter ("AS Friends"2 ), alleging that they violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as his rights under the American with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. Presently before the Court are the Defendants' separate motions to dismiss the SAC, as well as AS Friends' motion to strike portions of the SAC.
A. Factual History
1. Wehner's Arrest and the Seizure of Travis
As alleged in the SAC, on November 16, 2017, Wehner rented a room at the Guesthouse Inn at 1191 E. Foothill Blvd., Uplant, CA 91786 ("Hotel"). See SAC ¶ 16. On November 17, 2017, City police officer Gabriel Santana arrived at the Hotel along with Christina Tomeo, a City animal control officer. Id. ¶ 17. Eventually, Wehner was arrested for violations of Cal. Pen. Code § 69 (resisting an executive officer) and § 459 (second degree commercial burglary). Id. ¶ 18. He [*3]  was transported to a hospital for injuries arising during the arrest and thereafter booked into jail. Id. ¶¶ 17-18. Santana transferred possession of Travis to Tomeo. Id. ¶¶ 23-24. Wehner was charged in San Bernardino County Superior Court with: (1) resisting a police officer; (2) failure to care for an animal; (3) knowing and fraudulent representation of himself as the owner of a service dog; and (4) second-degree commercial burglary. SAC ¶ 29. The case was prosecuted by Debbie Ploghaus, an assistant district attorney for San Bernardino County. Wehner pled guilty to the first and third charges on December 19, 2017. SAC ¶ 30.3
2. Wehner's Detention and Attempts to Regain Possession of Travis
Wehner was detained at the West Valley Detention Center from November 17, 2017 to December 19, 2017. Id. ¶ 47. While he was detained, Wehner alleges that he made multiple attempts to get Travis back. His formal ADA request - while he was in jail - to have Travis with him in the detention center was denied, Id. ¶ 27; and his repeated calls to the animal shelter were refused because the shelter would not accept calls from jail. Id. Travis was "adopted-out" of the City Animal Shelter on December 19, [*4]  2017, while Wehner was in pre-trial custody. Id. ¶¶ 31-32.
Wehner asserts that while he was detained, four other people had attempted — with his authorization — to get Travis back for him, but that they were all refused. Id. ¶ 46. These attempts consisted of:
• In November of 2017, Wehner's mother spoke with Tomeo over the phone and explained that Wehner authorized her to take possession of Travis. However, Tomeo "told [Wehner's mother] that she could not take possession of Travis." Id. ¶ 49. Wehner's mother also spoke with Santana, who told her that she could not get back Travis because Travis was "taken by forfeiture." Id. ¶ 50.
• On November 25, 2017, Megan Moret, a friend of Wehner, spoke with Tomeo over the phone and asked to take possession of Travis. Tomeo refused and told Moret that Travis was set to be adopted by another person. Id. ¶ 51.
• On December 8, 2017, Ronald Johnson, a friend of Wehner, spoke with Tomeo in person at the animal shelter and gave her a letter from Wehner authorizing him to take possession of Travis. Id. ¶ 53. After Tomeo consulted Ploghaus, Tomeo explained to Johnson that Wehner had forfeited Travis and that Travis was set to be adopted by another person. [*5]  Id. ¶¶ 55, 62
• On December 12, 2017, Wehner's attorney mailed a letter to the animal shelter asking that Travis be handed over to Johnson. It appears no response was ever received. Id. ¶ 65.
3. Wehner's Release and Attempts to Take Back Possession of Travis
Wehner was released from the West Valley Detention Center on December 19, 2017 after pleading guilty to the resisting-a-police-officer and service-dog-fraud charges. Id. ¶ 66. After his release, Wehner went to the animal shelter to ask that Travis be returned to him but was unsuccessful. Id. ¶ 69.
B. Wehner's Claims Against Defendants
In the SAC, Wehner brings the following six causes of actions against the Defendants: (1) a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978), against the City for violation of the Fourth Amendment arising from the unreasonable seizure of Travis; (2) a claim under § 1983 and Monell against the City for violation of the Fourteenth Amendment arising from the Defendants' permanently depriving Wehner of his service dog without due process; (3) a Monell claim against the City for failure to train; (4) a Monell claim based on ratification of unlawful conduct against the City; (5) a violation of the ADA by the City for failure to accommodate his disabilities by allowing him to have [*6]  Travis with him while he was in pre-trial custody; and (6) conversion of Travis by AS Friends. See SAC at ¶¶ 88-215.

II. Legal Framework
A. Legal Standard
Under Rule 12(b)(6), a defendant may move to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). A complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim for one of two reasons: (1) lack of a cognizable legal theory; or (2) insufficient facts under a cognizable legal theory. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).
In deciding a 12(b)(6) motion, a court "may generally consider only allegations contained in the pleadings, exhibits attached to the complaint, and matters properly subject to judicial notice." Swartz v. KPMG LLP, 476 F.3d 756, 763 (9th Cir. 2007). The court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept all allegations of material fact as true, and draw all reasonable inferences from well-pleaded factual allegations. Gompper v. VISX, Inc., 298 F.3d 893, 896 (9th Cir. 2002). The court is not required to accept as true legal conclusions couched as factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Where a plaintiff facing a 12(b)(6) motion has pled "factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged," the motion should be denied. Id.; Sylvia Landfield Trust v. City of Los Angeles, 729 F.3d 1189, 1191 (9th Cir. 2013). But if "the well-pleaded facts do not permit [*7]  the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged — but it has not show[n] . . . the pleader is entitled to relief." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (citations omitted).
B. Section 1983 Claims
Section 1983 provides that:
Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . , subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law[.]
42 U.S.C. § 1983. Section 1983 does not create substantive rights, but instead acts as a vehicle for bringing federal constitutional and statutory challenges to actions taken by state and local officials. Anderson v. Warner, 451 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir. 2006). "To make out a cause of action under section 1983, plaintiffs must plead that (1) the defendants acting under color of state law [and] (2) deprived plaintiffs of rights secured by the Constitution or federal statutes." Gibson v. United States, 781 F.2d 1334, 1338 (9th Cir. 1986).
Wehner's Section 1983 claims against the City are not based upon actions directly taken by that governmental entity but rather on account of the conduct of its police officers and animal control employees. Still, "municipalities and other [*8]  local government units . . . [are] among those persons to whom § 1983 applies." Monell, 436 U.S. at 690; see also Edgerly v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 599 F.3d 946, 960 (9th Cir. 2010). However, a local governmental unit may not be held responsible for the acts of its employees under a respondeat superior theory of liability. See Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1997); Fogel v. Collins, 531 F.3d 824, 834 (9th Cir. 2008). "A municipality is responsible for a constitutional violation . . . only when an 'action [taken] pursuant to [an] official municipal policy of some nature' caused the violation." Castro v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 797 F.3d 654, 670 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 691). "Official municipal policy includes the decisions of a government's lawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law." Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 61, 131 S. Ct. 1350, 179 L. Ed. 2d 417 (2011).

III. Discussion
A. The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Claims against the City
Wehner alleges that there was an illegal seizure of Travis. But he does not dispute that the initial seizure was lawful, since California statute authorizes police officers to temporarily seize animals pursuant to an arrest. See generally Cal. Gov't Code § 26640. However, Wehner claims that the City's failure to provide a post-seizure hearing violated the Fourth Amendment. SAC ¶¶ 95-97. Though labeled a Fourth Amendment claim, it is actually a due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment.4 According to Wehner, no City employee told him that he was entitled to a post-deprivation hearing [*9]  and how he could request one. As the City recognizes: "[i]t is clear from the facts alleged that Plaintiff's true assertion is that the City violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights when it failed to provide him with notice that he could request a hearing under Penal Code §597.1 - not when it followed the City's Ordinance." See Upland Reply at 5. Therefore, the Court now considers whether the City can be held liable for that violation.
1. Whether there was an official policy
As noted above, the failure [*10]  by the City's police officers and/or animal control employees to provide Wehner with adequate notice of his rights to a hearing regarding the return of Travis would not be sufficient grounds for a Monell claim against the City under the first four causes of action in the SAC unless: (1) that failure was due to an actual policy or practice of the City, (2) the City ratified that misconduct, and/or (3) that nonfeasance was due to the failure of the City to properly train its employees.
According to Wehner, the City's unlawful policy is embodied in Upland Municipal Code § 604.190(F). Wehner takes issue with the requirement that the ordinance imposes on the City's chief animal services officer:
[t]o notify by mail the owner of any animal or dog impounded by him or her, stating that such animal or dog is confined at the city pound, and specify the amount necessary to reclaim or redeem the same, as provided in this chapter, and the period which dog or animal will be held before destroying or otherwise disposing of the same. Such notice shall be deposited in the United States post office, or a mailbox, in a sealed envelope, with postage prepaid, addressed to the owner of the animal, at the owner's place [*11]  of residence, if known, but if not known, then addressed to the owner at Upland, California. If the name of the owner of such impounded animal is not known, or after reasonable investigation, cannot be ascertained, then the notice may be dispensed with, in which case such animal may be placed up for adoption or disposed of by the chief animal services officer after the same has been impounded for four days. No disposition shall be made to other than the owner until the lapse of four days following such notification.
Upland Municipal Code § 6.04.190(F). Wehner contends that § 6.04.190(F) "fails to provide any meaningful opportunity" for a person whose animal is seized to contest the deprivation. SAC ¶ 34; see also Opp. to Upland MTD at 14 of 27 ("Ordinance 6.04.190 does not mention notice or a hearing, rather, the City through its employees, must send the owner a bill to retrieve their seized animal.").
The only evidence Wehner offers to support his position is an argument that § 6.04.190(F) conflicts with the due process requirements contained in the California animal safety statute that Wehner was charged with, i.e. Cal. Penal Code § 597.1. Section 597.1 authorizes police officers to seize animals from owners who fail to adequately care for them. According to Wehner, the City's possession [*12]  of Travis for longer than 48 hours violated Section 597.1(f), which mandated Travis's return to him. SAC ¶ 96. Wehner's argument has a number of problems.
As to the first problem, there are at least three ways in which dogs are placed into the City's animal shelter and those avenues have an impact on the applicable procedures which govern the animal's release back to their owners. Wehner in his SAC fails to precisely differentiate among the scenarios, which confounds his analysis. Initially, as noted in Upland Municipal Code § 6.04.180, the City's animal services officers are vested with the authority to "seiz[e] or impound[] any animal found running at large" and/or "upon receiving a subscribed complaint stating that there is reason to believe that any law of this city or the state of California relating to the humane care or treatment of animals is being violated, to enter upon premises and to ascertain the accuracy of such complaint, and to impound the animal or take such other action as will remedy the condition if it be found to exist." Thus, the first basis for an animal's being placed into the City's animal shelter is pursuant to the City's animal services officer's "impounding" the animal because it [*13]  is a stray or it was found improperly cared for or abused. In that situation, Upland Municipal Code § 6.04.200 provides that: "[t]he owner of any impounded animal shall have the right to reclaim the same at any time prior to the lawful disposition thereof upon the payment to the chief animal services officer of the costs, fees and charges provided for in this chapter" which, under Upland Municipal Code § 6.04.210(D) include moneys "to defray costs of feeding and caring for impounded animal." As delineated in the above cited § 6.04.190(F), among the duties of the City's animal service officers in regards to any animal so impounded by the officer is to notify the owner of: (1) the animal's being impounded at the City's animal shelter, (2) the period of time the animal will be held before it is destroyed or adopted-out (which at a minimum would be four days following the notification), and (3) the amount of money necessary to be paid upon the release of the animal. § 6.04.200 provides for the return of the animal when there is a timely request and upon the payment of costs. However, it is unclear whether there is a procedure specifically set forth in the City's Municipal Code whereby the owner can challenge the initial seizure and/or [*14]  impounding of the animal and/or the costs imposed before the animal's release.
A second way that an animal can be placed into a governmental animal shelter is pursuant to Cal. Penal Code § 597.1 which also deals with the situation where it is impounded because it is inadequately cared for or abused. However, Cal. Penal Code § 597.1(f) does provide for a post-seizure hearing upon timely request to determine the validity of the seizure or impounding of the animal as well as the responsibility for the costs incurred in caring for the animal following the seizure.5 If the seizure and impound of the animal is found to have been based on reasonable grounds, then the animal is not returned to its owner until the charges are paid and the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the seizing agency or the hearing officer that the owner can and will provide the necessary care for the animal. See Cal. Penal Code § 597.1(f)(4).
The third situation wherein an animal can be placed into a governmental shelter arises when the owner is arrested while in possession of the animal and thereafter is booked into county jail pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 26640.6 § 26640 provides that when a person is arrested and taken to county jail, all money and valuables in that person's possession are to be taken and kept until the person is released from jail or pursuant to a court order. See generally Minsky v. City of Los Angeles, 11 Cal. 3d 113, 119, 113 Cal. Rptr. 102, 520 P.2d 726 (1974). In that situation, "the government in effect occupies the position of a bailee when it seizes [property] from an arrestee . . . ." Id. at 121. Although the statute itself refers to the conduct of sheriffs, it has been held that § 26640 applies when a municipal police officer seizes an arrestee's property during the booking process. Id. at 119 n. 5. Because pre-trial jail detention centers are without proper facilities to [*18]  take of animals (see generally Fieselman v. Lewis, No. 14-CV-00030-RM—CBS, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4298, 2015 WL 170551, at *7 (D. Colo. Jan. 13, 2015)), an animal is placed in the shelter if there is no one immediately available to take possession of it. Further, § 26640 only provides for the return of valuables taken by the officer at the time of booking upon the release of the arrestee from jail ("or to his legal representative in case of his death or legal incapacity to make decisions"). It is unclear whether the post-seizure provisions of Cal. Penal Code § 597.1(f) are applicable in the § 26640 context involving animals taken from an arrestee at the time of booking into a jail.
The SAC [*19]  fails to adequately set forth an averment which alleges the basis for Travis's being seized and impounded (i.e. was it pursuant to § 604.180, § 597.1 and/or § 26640). Such an averment is important as it will control to some extent the procedures that would govern the dog's release and/or challenges to the costs to be paid (if any) prior to Travis's release. Thus, Wehner's contention - that the City's municipal code § 6.04.190(F) constitutes a policy or practice which deprived him of his due process rights in regards to Travis — initially fails as he has not alleged that § 6.04.190(F) was applied in his case.
As to a second problem, Wehner misinterprets the requirements of California statutory law. The due process procedures in Cal. Penal Code § 597.1 - which Wehner argues the City seeks to avoid by its use of § 6.04.190(F) - provides for the seizure of animals when an officer "has reasonable grounds to believe that very prompt action is required to protect the health or safety of the animal or the health or safety of others." Cal. Penal Code § 597.1(a). Wehner does not contest Santana's initial seizure of Travis pursuant to this provision. However, he claims that the City's "continued retention of Travis after the 48th hour mark had expired constituted an unreasonable seizure," referring to [*20]  the 48-hour notice requirement of § 597.1(f)(1). See SAC § 101. This misinterprets the notice requirement, which requires the officer who seizes an animal to provide notice to the owner within 48 hours of the seizure that includes information on how to request a post-seizure hearing. See Cal. Penal Code § 597.1(f)(1). Failing to notify Wehner within 48 hours would violate § 597.1(f)(1); but merely keeping possession of Travis beyond the 48 hours would not contravene the statute (and actually is contemplated by the § 597.1(f)(1).7
As to a third problem, Wehner fails to identify any conflict between the § 6.04.190(F) and California statutory law and explain how the conflict deprives him of due process.8 He argues that § 6.04.190(F) "does not mention notice or a hearing" and therefore "is in direct contravention" of Cal. Penal Code § 597.1. Opp. to Upland MTD at 14-15. While it is true the § 6.04.190(F) does not mention a hearing, it does require the chief animal services officer to "notify by mail the owner" of something even better — a way to reclaim the animal by paying a fee. See Upland Municipal Code § 6.04.190 (requiring that the notice to the owner "specify the amount necessary to reclaim or redeem the [seized animal]). This is sufficient due process. As stated in Simpson v. City of Los Angeles, 40 Cal.2d 271, 281-82, 253 P.2d 464 (1953):
There is no merit to plaintiffs' contention that the ordinance deprives [*21]  them of their property without a hearing. Section 53.13 provides that an owner may redeem an impounded animal upon payment of certain fees and charges, and section 53.12, which sets forth the charges to be collected by the Department of Animal Regulation, states that "No fees whatsoever shall be charged or collected for or on account of any animal which has been unlawfully taken up or impounded, and any such animal shall be immediately delivered upon demand therefor to the owner or person entitled to the custody thereof." The ordinance thus contemplates that a factual or mixed factual and legal determination shall be made by the department, and under these circumstances it must be interpreted to provide for a hearing, when requested by the owner, upon the question of whether a dog has been legally seized.
For these reasons, the Court rejects Wehner's argument that the cited portion of the § 6.04.190(F) provides insufficient due process. While the Court accepts Wehner's factual allegation that he was not provided a post-seizure hearing, Wehner has not sufficiently alleged that this was pursuant to a formally promulgated policy or practice. Thus, at this point, we must examine the two alternative theories for municipal liability: [*22]  (1) the City did not adequately train its employees to provide animal owners with sufficient due process; or (2) a City official with sufficient decision-making authority ratified the unlawful actions of the City employees. The Court now turns to these two theories.
2. Whether there was a failure to train
Municipal liability can be established by demonstrating that the alleged constitutional violation was caused by a failure to train municipal employees adequately. See City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388-91, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1989); Price v. Sery, 513 F.3d 962, 973 (9th Cir. 2008). This showing has three elements: (1) the training program must be inadequate "in relation to the tasks the particular officers must perform"; (2) the city officials must have been deliberately indifferent "to the rights of persons with whom the [local officials] come into contact"; and (3) the inadequacy of the training "must be shown to have 'actually caused' the constitutional deprivation at issue." Merritt v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 875 F.2d 765, 770 (9th Cir. 1989) (internal citations omitted). "A municipality's culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most tenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train." Connick, 563 U.S. at 61.
It is true, as Wehner notes, that a "lack of affirmative policies or procedures to guide employees can amount to deliberate indifference even when [] other general [*23]  policies [are] in place." See Long v. County of Los Angeles, 442 F.3d 1178, 1189 (9th Cir. 2006); Opp. to Upland MTD at 19. However, as observed earlier, this is not a case where the failure to provide due process was the result of (1) an unlawful municipal policy, or (2) the lack of an affirmative policy. Here, the challenged ordinance provided animal owners with something constitutionally sufficient on top of what was required by California statute.
Wehner's failure-to-train theory therefore must be based on the premise that despite the requirements of § 6.04.190(F) and Section 597.1(f), Santana and Tomeo did not provide Wehner with due process because of the City's failure to adequately train them.
To state a failure-to-train claim, a plaintiff generally must plead that the defendant's policy-makers were "on actual or constructive notice that a particular omission in their training program causes [] employees to violate citizens' constitutional rights," and that the defendant nevertheless chose to continue the program. Connick, 563 U.S. at 61. Wehner argues that the fact that "three officers — over a period of more than two-and-a-half years" failed to provide due process is evidence of a failure to train. Opp. to Upland MTD at 20.9 However, this measures the wrong period. The two-and-a-half years appear to be calculated from the time of the seizure [*24]  (in November 2017) to today. However, whatever happened after the alleged denial of due process cannot have put the City on notice of its alleged failure-to-train. Therefore, Wehner's claim essentially boils down to arguing that the unconstitutional acts on one occasion by three City employees raise an inference of the City's failure to train.
Although a failure to train typically requires "proof of a pre-existing pattern of violations," there are rare cases where it can be demonstrated by a single incident that suggests a "patently obvious" failure. Connick, 563 U.S. at 64. In these narrow circumstances, the need for training "is so obvious," and "the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights," that one incident is enough to impose municipal liability. Canton, 489 U.S. at 390.
Under Wehner's single-incident theory, the City's employees had no knowledge of the constitutionally required due process protections that animal owners have. The problem with Plaintiff's contention is that, as noted supra, Wehner has failed to allege the applicable basis for Travis's seizure and impoundment. Thus, it is unclear what notice and due process procedures should have been afforded to him and who was the person(s) [*25]  responsible for assuring that his due process rights were met. For example, if Santana was the officer who made the decision to seize and impound Travis, then under Cal. Penal Code § 597.1 he would be the person who would be responsible for providing Wehner with the notice of the opportunity for a post-seizure hearing, and not Tomeo or Myers. On the other hand, if the basis for Travis's seizure and impoundment was § 604.180, then the City's "chief animal services officer" would be responsible.10 As currently alleged, there does not appear to be a failure by more than one person and, hence, no indicia of a failure to train as opposed to the potential nonfeasance of a single employee.
In light of the above, the Court concludes that Wehner has not adequately alleged a failure of the City to train its employees.
3. Whether anyone ratified the failure to notify Wehner of his right to request a post-deprivation hearing
Ratification of the decisions of a subordinate by an official with final decision-making authority can also be a policy for purposes of municipal liability under Section 1983. See City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 127, 108 S. Ct. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988); Trevino v. Gates, 99 F.3d 911, 920-21 (9th Cir. 1996). Wehner hypothesizes that the City's "chief of police and city manager" are policymakers and ratified the alleged unlawful acts by Santana, [*26]  Tomeo, and Tomeo's supervisor. SAC ¶ 156. As evidence of this ratification, Wehner alleges that none of the City employees were ever disciplined for their failure to provide him with a post-deprivation hearing. Opp. to Upland MTD at 17.
A "single decision by a municipal policymaker may be sufficient to trigger section 1983 liability under Monell, even though the decision is not intended to govern future situations." Gillette v. Delmore, 979 F.2d 1342, 1347 (9th Cir. 1992). However, "[t]here must be evidence of a conscious, affirmative choice." Id. Mere acquiescence in a single instance of alleged unconstitutional conduct is not sufficient to demonstrate ratification. Id. (finding that the city manager's "alleged acquiescence in [plaintiff]'s termination" was insufficient to constitute ratification). Unfortunately for Wehner, his ratification argument is precisely that. His claim is that the city manager and police chief acquiesced in Santana's, Tomeo's, and Myers's failure to provide Wehner with a post-deprivation hearing. This is insufficient. The only other evidence of ratification he provides is the fact that the City has left the allegedly unconstitutional § 6.04.190(F) in place. But, as explained earlier, the Court found that Wehner has not pled any constitutional defect with § 6.04.190(F). Based [*27]  on these reasons, the Court dismisses the ratification argument as it is currently pled.
4. The ADA claim against the City
Wehner alleges that he "has disabilities recognized under the Americans with Disabilities Act because he has mental impairments," and that the City denied him a reasonable accommodation, in violation of the Title II of the ADA, by rejecting his request to have Travis with him while he was detained. SAC ¶¶ 186-96.
To survive a motion to dismiss, a Title II ADA plaintiff must plead the following elements: (1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) he was excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated against with regard to a public entity's services, programs, or activities; and (3) such exclusion or discrimination was by reason of his disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12182; Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th Cir. 2002).
Wehner states that "the crux of [his] ADA allegations" is that after the City failed to provide him notice of his right to a post-deprivation hearing, the City "lost any legal authority to possess Travis" and that the "City was obligated to produce Travis to [Wehner] as a reasonable accommodation to his ADA disability." Opp. to Upland MTD at 26. However, there are several problems with this claim. First, as explained [*28]  earlier, Wehner misinterprets Cal. Penal Code § 597.1 - the 48-hour window is about providing notice, it is not a limit on how long the seizing agency may possess the animal. Second, while Wehner has averred that he was unlawfully denied a post-seizure hearing, that issue is separate from the question of whether he was entitled to have Travis with him while he was detained at the county jail. Wehner cites no authority suggesting that: (1) despite health and safety reasons (for both inmates and animals), service dogs are to be allowed in jails for reasons of ADA accomodation (see generally Fieselman, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4298, 2015 WL 170551, at *7 (a plaintiff was properly separated from her service dog at a detention facility because "the jail was not properly situated to care for the animal")), and (2) that detention centers cannot provide alternative accommodations where allowing a service dog is not feasible (whether for health, safety, or other reasons). Wehner also did not plead that the facility where he was detained did not provide such alternative accommodations. Finally, Wehner overlooks the fact that he was in the custody of San Bernardino County in its detention facilities; not the City. Thus, he has brought this ADA claim against the wrong party. For [*29]  these reasons, the Court dismisses the ADA claim.
5. The Conversion Claim against AS Friends11
Under California law, the tort of conversion consists of three elements: "(a) plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of personal property, (b) defendant's disposition of property in a manner inconsistent with plaintiff's property rights, and (c) resulting damages." Voris v. Lampert, 7 Cal.5th 1141, 1150, 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 779, 446 P.3d 284 (2019). "Notably absent from this formula is any element of wrongful intent or motive; in California, conversion is a 'strict liability tort.'" Id. (citing Moore v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 51 Cal.3d 120, 144, 271 Cal. Rptr. 146, 793 P.2d 479 (1990); Poggi v. Scott, 167 Cal. 372, 375, 139 P. 815 (1914) ("neither good nor bad faith, neither care nor negligence, neither knowledge nor ignorance, are of the gist of the action").
A successful plaintiff is entitled to recover "[t]he value of the property at the time of the conversion, with the interest from that time, or, an amount sufficient to indemnify the party injured for the loss which is the natural, reasonable and proximate result of the wrongful act complained of and which a proper degree of prudence on his part would not have averted" plus "fair compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of the property." Cal. Civ. Code § 3336. Punitive damages are recoverable pursuant to a conversion claim upon a showing of malice, fraud, [*30]  or oppression. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a); Voris, 7 Cal.5th at 1151.
As to AS Friends, Wehner has merely alleged that:
[the City] operates the Upland Animal Shelter in partnership with Defendant FRIENDS OF UPLAND ANIMAL SHELTER. The CITY contracts with FRIENDS OF UPLAND ANIMAL SHELTER for certain animal control services and pays FRIEND [sic] OF UPLAND ANIMAL SHELTER for its provision of certain animal control services. As CITY acts by and through its individual police officers and animal control officers and supervisors, defendant CITY is responsible to reasonably select and hire, and to reasonably educate, instruct and train, and direct, supervise, control, and discipline the conduct of its police and animal control officers and supervisors, in recurring situations such as are alleged herein, in which its officers' violations of the civil and statutory rights of individuals . . . . * * * *
[AS Friends] is a non-profit Internal Revenue Code § 501(c)(3) organization, operates the CITY Animal Shelter in partnership with the CITY, located at 1275 San Bernardino Road, Upland, CA 91786. FRIENDS has a contract with the CITY, whereby they provide services to the CITY in exchange for payment, is directly responsible for all animal sheltering and adoptions at the CITY Animal [*31]  Shelter. FRIENDS has, at all times relevant to this action, been responsible for animal care & adoption services for the CITY. * * * *
During his incarceration from November 17, 2017 to December 19, 2017, WEHNER made several calls from jail to FRIENDS but was unable to reach FRIENDS because it would not accept telephone calls from jail. * * * *
See SAC ¶¶ 7, 8, 47.12 Those allegations are not sufficient to establish a claim for conversion. For example, Wehner has alleged conduct on the part of Tomeo in regards to the seizure and eventual disposition of Travis. However, Tomeo is identified as a "CITY animal control officer" (see SAC ¶ 18) and not an employee of AS Friends.
AS Friends does raise two contentions which should be discussed at this point. First, AS Friends asserts that it did not seize Travis but rather merely came into contact with him once he was taken to the City's animal shelter; and, thereafter, only dealt with Travis in the normal course of its handling of dogs at the shelter, which included following normal procedures for the adoption of animals after a certain period of time. It argues that the "City was responsible for keeping Travis while Plaintiff [*32]  was incarcerated." AS MTD at 9. Thus, the City was the entity with the obligation to return Travis to Wehner and not AS Friends. The Court agrees with AS Friends as to the current insufficiency of Plaintiff's conversion allegations against it.
However, in support of that position, AS Friends requests that the Court take judicial notice of the "Animal Shelter Lease Agreement" ("Agreement") between the City and AS Friends which purportedly establishes that it " is not a governmental entity, does not perform any law enforcement duties and does not perform animal control duties for the CITY." Id. at 5. While the Agreement does appear to support some of AS Friends' arguments, the Court cannot take judicial notice of the Agreement. In its consideration of a motion to dismiss, the Court is generally limited to the allegations on the face of the complaint (including documents attached thereto), matters which are properly judicially noticeable and "documents whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the pleading." See Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688-89 (9th Cir. 2001); Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 453-54 (9th Cir. 1994), overruling on other grounds recognized in Galbraith v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2002). "A court may [also] consider evidence on which the complaint 'necessarily [*33]  relies' if: (1) the complaint refers to the document; (2) the document is central to the plaintiff's claim; and (3) no party questions the authenticity of the copy attached to the 12(b)(6) motion." Marder v. Lopez, 450 F.3d 445, 448 (9th Cir. 2006). Here, while the SAC does aver that the CITY contracts with AS Friends for certain animal control services (see SAC ¶7), Wehner has not acknowledged that the Agreement is the contract referenced in the SAC, nor has he conceded that the contract operates as AS Friends interprets it.
Second, AS Friends makes a somewhat technical procedural argument with which the Court does not concur. AS Friends argues that Travis was taken into custody upon Wehner's arrest and his being taken to the hospital and thereafter booked into county jail pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 26640.13 § 26640 provides that, at booking, the person's valuables are to be taken and kept until the person is released from jail or pursuant to a court order. See generally Minsky, 11 Cal. 3d at 119. AS Friends argues that the remedy for a failure to return property seized pursuant to § 26640 is only an action for mandamus which has a one-year statute of limitations pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. P. § 340(d). But here, AS Friends is not claiming that it seized Travis pursuant to the booking process, nor is it claiming that [*34]  it was acting in the capacity of a bailee/arresting officer. Hence, § 26640 would not apparently apply to it at all. Furthermore, the California Supreme Court has indicated that a plaintiff seeking the return of property seized during the booking process can proceed by way of an action for conversion, which has a three-year statute of limitations. See Minsky, 11 Cal. 3d at 119 n.6.
Lastly, as to Wehner's claim for punitive damages which must be based on malice, fraud, or oppression, the SAC barely mentions any involvement by AS Friends. All of the alleged communications involving his mother, Moret, and Johnson, were with a City employee (Tomeo) - not an AS [*35]  Friends representative. The only alleged communication that could plausibly have involved AS Friends - i.e. a letter sent by Wehner's attorney on December 12, 2017 to the City's animal shelter — occurred after Travis was adopted-out on December 9, 2017. SAC ¶ 65. That letter cannot support a conversion claim, let alone an inference of malice, fraud, or oppression in AS Friends' adopting-out Travis.14
In light of the above discussion, the Court dismisses the conversion cause of action against AS Friends and the claim for punitive damages against it. The Court will give Wehner one more opportunity to attempt to state a viable claim against AS Friends.
C. Animal Shelter Friends' Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint
"Motions to strike are generally disfavored by courts." Bogazici Hava Tasimaciligi A.S. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 932 F.2d 972, 974 [published in full-text format at 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 10273, at *6] (9th Cir. 1991). In most cases, a motion to strike is not granted either because it is used as a delaying tactic or — relevant here — because "of the limited importance of pleadings in federal practice." Rosales v. Citibank, 133 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1180 (N.D. Cal. 2001). AS Friends moves to strike portions of the SAC that consist of legal conclusions. The Court denies the motion in part because, as AS Friends notes, the Court is not required to accept the truth of legal conclusions couched as factual [*36]  allegations. For most of its requests, striking them from the SAC would not have any meaningful effect. The Court, however, finds that paragraph 158 of the complaint, which alleges an unlawful conspiracy between the City and AS Friends, is particularly pejorative and without factual support, and therefore strikes that one paragraph.

IV. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing discussion, the Court GRANTS both the City's and AS Friends' motions to dismiss, but the Court will give Plaintiff one more chance to state a viable cause of action. The Court also GRANTS IN PART AS Friends' motion to strike. Wehner will have until July 31, 2020 to file a Third Amended Complaint.
