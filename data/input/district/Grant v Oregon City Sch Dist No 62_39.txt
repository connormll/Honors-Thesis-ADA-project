FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
YOU, Magistrate Judge:

INTRODUCTION
Defendant Oregon City School District No. 62 ("District") moves pursuant to FRCP 56(a) for summary judgment against the claims of a former employee, plaintiff Christina Grant ("Grant"). Grant alleges seven claims for relief against the District: (1) discrimination (First Claim) and retaliation (Second Claim) in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"); (2) discrimination and retaliation in violation of state whistleblower protection provisions, ORS 659A.199 (Third Claim) and ORS 659A.230 (Fourth Claim); (3) injured worker discrimination and retaliation in violation of ORS 659A.040 (Fifth Claim); (4) violation of the Oregon Rehabilitation Act, ORS 659A.103 et seq. (Sixth Claim); and (5) wrongful termination (Seventh Claim). This court has jurisdiction over Grant's ADA claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and supplemental jurisdiction over Grant's state law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).
For the [*2]  reasons discussed below, the District's motion should be granted regarding the third, fourth, and seventh claims. In all other respects, the motion should be denied.

BACKGROUND FACTS
The District is a public school district in the State of Oregon. Compl. ¶ 7, ECF #1. As part of its Oregon City Community Education Program, the District operates early childhood education programs at many of its elementary schools. Cheryl Howell ("Howell") is the Program Coordinator of the District's Early Childhood Education/Child Care and School Age Programs. Decl. Cheryl Howell ("Howell Decl.") ¶ 1, ECF #15. Howell supervises the early childhood program at Eastham Elementary and a pre-kindergarten classroom at Holcomb Elementary. Decl. Daniel Snyder ("Snyder Decl."), Ex. 53 ("Howell Dep.") at 14:5-12, ECF #22-3. In mid-September 2015, Howell hired Grant to work as a classroom assistant in a pre-kindergarten class at Eastham Elementary. Howell Decl. ¶ 2, ECF #15.
The parties do not dispute that on October 14, 2015, while working at Eastham, Grant was injured. Howell Dep. 46:6-8, ECF #22-3. The next day, Grant arrived at work wearing a sling prescribed by a physician and reported the injury to Howell. Howell [*3]  Dep. 35:9-18, ECF #22-3. At Howell's request, Grant completed a Supervisor's Incident Report. In the report, Grant stated that "[a] student was physically aggressive towards me and injured my left shoulder. I was breaking up two students fighting on the outside playground. The one retaliated against me in anger, but it was resolved in the proper manner." Howell Decl., Ex. 1, ECF #15. Laura Poore, the District's Supervisor of Oregon City Community Education and Howell's supervisor, also signed the form. Id. There is no dispute that Grant notified the District of the injury within twenty-four hours. Snyder Decl., Ex. 56 ("Lockard Dep.") at 32:14-17, ECF #22-3.
On October 16, 2015, Grant initiated a workers' compensation claim and on October 27, 2015, Wes Rogers, the District's Director of Operations, signed State Accident Insurance Fund ("SAIF") Form 801, reporting Grant's injury. Snyder Decl., Ex. 2, ECF #22-1; Answer ¶ 4. On December 1, 2015, SAIF accepted Grant's workers' compensation claim. Snyder Decl., Ex. 29, ECF #22-2. Gail Hoskins Lockard, the Safety Risk Management Coordinator responsible for managing Grant's workers' compensation claim for the District, later summarized what [*4]  Grant told her in an email to SAIF:
According to Christina, two students began to argue, so she separated them. One of the students, a four year-old, got angry and ran towards her jumping up and grabbing her arm around the biceps pulling her arm down and started punching her arm. She thought three times or so. He was very agitated yelling at her. At that time her arm was throbbing and hurt but was not aching or hurt bad enough that she thought she should call for assistance.
Lockard Dep. at 15:19-21; 31:18-24; 103:2-23, ECF #22-3.
When Grant returned to work, the District assigned her to modified duty as an office assistant. Lockard supervised Grant while she was on modified duty from November 10, 2015, until her termination in February 2016. Decl. Gail Lockard ("Lockard Decl.") ¶¶ 1-2, ECF #16. During that time, the District presented Grant with several modified job descriptions and, on December 11, 2015, began assigning her to work on modified duty covering staff absences at different schools. Howell Dep. 70:25; 71:1-3, ECF #22-3. While covering at Holcomb Elementary, Grant alleges she was instructed by a supervisor to engage in dodgeball with the children. Decl. Christina Grant ("Grant [*5]  Decl.") ¶ 59, ECF #23. Grant alleges that, when she declined because of her injury, the supervisor was annoyed. Id.
District employees questioned the severity of Grant's injury, despite having access to medical records including a doctor's note referencing an MRI showing "extensive damage." Snyder Decl., Ex. 8, ECF #22-1. Lockard exchanged emails with SAIF expressing her concern that Grant's claim kept getting "bigger" and that she was getting different opinions from different doctors. Lockard Dep. 47:14-25; 48:1; 73:1-2, ECF #22-3. She wrote to SAIF, "[e]very time she calls I have more doubts about her truthfulness," and "I watched her escalate this, and each time I talk to her it's radically worse than before." Id. at 73:3-6; 74:6-11. Poore also expressed her opinion that there was nothing objectively wrong with Grant's shoulder. Poore Dep. 65:17-20, ECF #22-3.
Prior to terminating Grant, District employees discussed internally and with SAIF concerns about the costs associated with Grant's continued employment. They feared Grant was going to have surgery while she was on workers' compensation and that she might be reinjured and file another claim if she continued working. Snyder Decl., [*6]  Ex. 58 ("Rogers Dep.") at 17:2-5, ECF #22-3; Lockard Dep. 133:14-18; 134:11-14; 136:11-16, ECF #22-3. On January 14, 2015, SAIF notified Lockard by email that if Grant was "terminated for cause, violation of work rules or other disciplinary reasons, then we would stop paying time loss." Lockard Dep. 121:6-122:11, ECF #22-3. The result would be lower premiums for the District. Rogers Dep. 7:2-6, ECF #22-3.
On February 5, 2016, the District terminated Grant's employment. Howell Decl., Ex. 4, ECF #15. The termination notice, signed by Howell and Poore, enumerates the reasons for termination: use of a cell phone when present with children, insubordination, inappropriate language with co-workers, inappropriate conversation while children were present, and inability to effectively supervise a group of children with appropriate activities. Id; see also Answer ¶ 6. The notice indicates that the decision was prompted by Grant's job performance while assigned to Holcomb Elementary. Id. Howell testified that she relied on reports from Holcomb Elementary site supervisors Kristina Gadberry and Alissa Tippin detailing Grant's conduct while she was assigned to modified duty at Holcomb on January 19 [*7]  and January 26, 2016, respectively. These allegations were not contemporaneously reported or recorded, but were reduced to writing at Howell's request on February 4th, the day before termination. Howell Dep. 75:4-24, ECF #22-3.

STANDARDS
A party is entitled to summary judgment if the "movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." FRCP 56(a). The moving party has the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant and draw all reasonable inferences in the non-movant's favor. Newmaker v. City of Fortuna, 842 F.3d 1108, 1111 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S.Ct. 2217, 198 L. Ed. 2d 658 (2017). Although "[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge . . . ruling on a motion for summary judgment," the "mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position [is] insufficient . . . ." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citation and quotation marks omitted).

FINDINGS [*8] 

I. Disability Discrimination (First and Sixth Claims)
The District seeks summary judgment against Grant's first and sixth claims for disability discrimination on the grounds that: (1) it discharged Grant for workplace misconduct, not for her disability; and (2) Grant cannot show that the District failed to engage in the interactive process or accommodate Grant's disability. Based on the record submitted in connection with this motion, which at this stage must be construed in the light most favorable to Grant, these arguments fail.

A. Plaintiff's evidence establishes a prima facie case of disability discrimination and raises genuine issues of material fact for trial.
Grant alleges that the District discriminated against her in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and the Oregon Rehabilitation Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213; ORS 659A.103-145.. Federal courts interpret the Oregon disability statutes under the same standard as the ADA. Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1087 (9th Cir. 2001).
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that she is a qualified individual with a disability who suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Id.; Smith v. Clark Cty. Sch. Dist., 727 F.3d 950, 955 (9th Cir. 2013); Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,, 164 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 1999); Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir. 1996). Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie [*9]  case for discrimination, the burden shifts to defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), The plaintiff must then show that the defendant's reason is merely pretext. Id.at 804. Pretext can be shown by "'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence . . . .'" Dept. of Fair Emp't. and Hous. v. Lucent Tech., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 746 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Morgan v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal.App.4th 52, 105 Cal.Rptr.2d 652, 670 (2000).
The proof required to establish a prima facie case on summary judgment "is minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence." Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994). "As a general matter, the plaintiff in an employment discrimination action need produce very little evidence in order to overcome an employer's motion for summary judgment. This is because 'the ultimate question is one that can only be resolved through a searching inquiry — one that is most appropriately conducted by a factfinder, upon a full record.'" Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Tr'ees, 225 F.3d 1115, 1124 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Schnidrig v. Columbia Mach., Inc., 80 F.3d 1406, 1410 (9th Cir. 1996)). The question "[w]hether an employer who discharged an employee was motivated by an impermissible reason is a question of fact." Huber v. Or. Dep't of Educ., 235 Or. App. 230, 240, 230 P.3d 937 (2010).
Here, plaintiff alleges that she is a qualified [*10]  individual with a disability. Compl. ¶34, ECF #1. A "qualified individual" is "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) (emphasis added); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m); see also Wiederhold v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 888 F. Supp.2d 1065, 1079-81 (D. Or. 2012). "Essential functions" are "fundamental job duties of the employment position ... not includ[ing] the marginal functions of the position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1). The District does notcontest that Grant is a qualified individual in its motion, and in any event there are no facts to rebut Grant's claim. Bates v. UPS, 511 F.3d 974, 991 (9th Cir. 2007) ("[A]n employer who disputes the plaintiff's claim that he can perform the essential functions must put forth evidence establishing those functions").
The District instead argues that there is no causal link between Grant's disability and her termination, as is required to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Where there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the causation prong of a prima facie claim under the ADA, the courts in this circuit have concluded that the plaintiff has met its prima facie burden. Arnold v. Pfizer, Inc., 970 F. Supp.2d 1106, 1137-38 (D. Or. 2013); Lucke v. Multnomah Cty., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71861, 2008 WL 4372882, at *26 (D. Or. Sept. 22, 2008). At summary judgment, the Ninth Circuit has held that the requisite causation can be inferred [*11]  from circumstantial evidence. Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987).
There is evidence in the record, including circumstantial evidence, that raises sufficient factual issues about the causal connection. For example, although the District asserts that Grant was terminated for misconduct including cellphone use, bad language, inappropriate references to alcohol, and insubordination, there is no documentation of any such behavior prior to her injury. Howell Dep. 40:21-42:8; 65:9-19; 67:21-68:20, ECF #22-3; Snyder Decl., Ex. 54 ("Gadberry Dep.") at 11:11-25, ECF #22-3; Poore Dep. 32:13-24; 34:5-36:15; 37:21-38:7; 44:10-21, ECF #22-3. Written reports alleging the post-injury misconduct were prepared only the day before termination, and there is no contemporaneous documentation of the alleged incidents. Howell Dep. 73:20-75:10, ECF #22-3. Moreover, communications with SAIF evidence that District employees had concerns about costs and avoiding time loss payments. Lockard wrote, "I'm worried she's going to claim now that she was injured more to extend her time." Lockard Dep. 136:11-16, ECF #22-3. In advance of the termination, Hoskins was conferring with SAIF about whether Grant would be entitled to time loss payments if she [*12]  was terminated. Howell Dep. 83:24, 25; 84:1-4, ECF #22-3. John Ogden, the Director of Human Resources for the District, knew that if Grant was terminated for cause, the District could stop paying time-loss benefits. Ogden Dep. 60:13-18, ECF #22-3. This evidence, when construed in a light most favorable to Grant, supports a causal connection between the disability and the termination and forms a sufficient basis for a prima facie case of discrimination.
Accordingly, the burden shifts to the District to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for Grant's termination. See Arnold, 970 F. Supp.2d at 1138. The District attempts to rebut the prima facie showing here by alleging that Grant was discharged for workplace misconduct. To do so, it relies on the two handwritten reports detailing incidents on January 19 and January 26, 2016, that were prepared on February 4th, the same day on which the termination letter was drafted. Howell Decl., Exs. 2, 3, ECF #15. As detailed above, there are issues of material fact that the District's reliance on these reports was a pretext for the real reason Grant was terminated. See also Doby v. Sisters of St. Mary of Or. Ministries Corp., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110972, 2014 WL 3943713 at *8 (D. Or. Aug 11, 2014) (finding circumstantial evidence of pretext created a factual issue precluding summary judgment). [*13]  The factual issues concerning the District's motivation for termination preclude summary judgment on counts one and six.

B. Factual issues also remain as to whether reasonable accommodations were made by the District.
Employers have an affirmative duty to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a). Thus, once aware of the need for accommodation, an employer is obligated to engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify and implement appropriate reasonable accommodations. Dean v. Safeway, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162404, 2014 WL 6473543 at *16-17 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 2014) ("the duty to engage in an interactive process is part of the duty to accommodate"). The interactive process "requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees, and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." Humphrey v. Mem. Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).
The District seeks summary judgment with respect to reasonable accommodation because it alleges it did not know about the disability, Grant never made it aware of the disability, Grant never requested accommodation, and therefore, as a matter of law, it had no obligation to provide accommodation. Mot. Summ. J. 5, ECF #14. Contrary to this assertion, the evidence shows the District [*14]  was aware of the disability. Grant completed an incident report following the injury. Snyder Decl., Ex. 1, ECF #22-1. Ogden knew that Grant had been injured on the job and had filed a workers' compensation claim. Ogden Dep. 25:11-16; 34:17-19, ECF #22-3. Ogden also knew Grant had an injury that included a tear in her shoulder. Id. at 34:25; 35:1-4. Howell told Ogden that Grant was on modified duty for her on-the-job injury. Howell Dep. 58:9-15, ECF #22-3. Grant explained, both to Lockard and to Poore, that she required more time to complete tasks because of limited use of her left arm and she told Howell she could not engage in sports with children. Grant Decl. ¶¶ 39, 43, ECF #23.
Moreover, the record is clear that the District did modify Grant's work duties to accommodate conditions described in the doctors' notes. See Snyder Decl., Ex.3, ECF #22-1 (requiring 5 day leave); id. at Ex. 15 (reporting "extensive shoulder damage" and excusing Grant from work indefinitely); id. at Ex. 18 (returning to light duty with a lift restriction); id. at Ex. 31, ECF #22-2 (returning to light duty with a lift restriction). Grant was assigned as an office assistant at Eastham School and a laptop was [*15]  purchased, and reimbursed by the Employer-at-Injury Program ("EAIP"), to allow her to work on a large data entry project. Id., Exs. 8, 19, ECF 22-1. On several occasions between early November 2015 and early February 2016, the District presented Grant with modified job descriptions. See id., Exs. 24, 26; Grant Decl., ¶¶ 34, 47, 52, 57, ECF #23. On December 11, 2015, the District began assigning Grant to work on modified duty at schools other than Eastham and to cover staff absences. Poore Dep. 21:6-17, ECF #22-3; Snyder Decl., Ex. 52, ECF #22-2; Howell Dep. 70:25; 71:1-3, ECF #22-3. While working at another school, Grant was asked to play dodgeball with the students by the supervisor. Grant Decl. ¶ 59, ECF #23.
While it is evident accommodations were made, there remain factual issues as to the reasonableness of the accommodations, particularly those that required her to engage in sports with the children. "Notably, the issue of whether or not an accommodation is reasonable ordinarily is a question of fact." Wiederhold, 888 F. Supp.2d at 1083 (citing Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1138). These factual issues preclude summary judgment on the reasonable accommodation allegations in claims one and six.

II. Retaliation (Second Claim)
A prima facie case of retaliation [*16]  under the ADA requires the employee to show that she: (1) engaged in a protected activity; (2) suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Pardi v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 389 F.3d 840, 849 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). "The same burden shifting analysis employed in failure to accommodate claims applies in retaliation claims." Piccarreta v. Harmony Hospice of Scottsdale LLC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165732, 2013 WL 6118641, at *2 (D. Ariz. Nov 21, 2013) (citing Payne v. Norwest Copr., 113 F.3d 1079, 1080 (9th Cir 1997).
The District contends that it is entitled to summary judgment against Grant's retaliation claim because Grant never "raised an issue under the ADA," by which it presumably means she did not engage in a "protected activity"; however, this assertion is contradicted by the District employees' testimony that Grant was injured at work, filled out an incident report, made a workers' compensation claim, submitted doctors' notes to obtain accommodations and did, in fact, receive accommodations in the form of modified duty work. See Howell Dep. 54, ECF #22-3; Lockard Dep. 86:15-2; 93:13-16, ECF #22-3; Poore Dep. 65:6-66:5, ECF #22-3. Making an informal complaint to a supervisor is a protected activity under the ADA. Ray v. Henderson, 217 F.3d 1234, 1240 n.3 (9th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). Requesting reasonable accommodations for an alleged disability likewise is a protected activity. See [*17]  Piccarreta, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165732, 2013 WL 6118641, at *3-4; Doby, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110972, 2014 WL 3943713, at *6; Arnold, 970 F. Supp.2d at 1141.
What remains is an analysis of whether Grant has produced sufficient evidence supporting her contention that the nondiscriminatory reasons proffered by defendant are pretexts for retaliation. For the reasons addressed in the sections above, she has.

III. Whistleblower Claim Under ORS 659A.199 (Third Claim)
The District moves for summary judgment against the third claim on the basis that ORS 659A.199 is not applicable to public bodies. ORS 659A.199 prohibits employers from retaliating against an employee who has "in good faith reported information that the employee believes is evidence of a violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation." ORS 659A.199(1).
Grant counters that the text of the statute does not distinguish between claims against public or private employers; however, courts in this district have relied on legislative history repeatedly to conclude that ORS 659A.199 does not apply to public employees. See Lindsey v. Clatskanie People's Util. Dist., 140 F. Supp.3d 1077, 1094-5 (D. Or. 2015) (discussing the legislative history of ORS 659A.199 and concluding that it does not apply to public employers); Minger v. Hood Cmty. Coll. Dist., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13995, 2016 WL 475382 at *7 (D. Or. Feb. 4, 2016) (concluding that ORS 659A.199 was enacted to extend to employees of private employers the protections available to public employees in other sections); Vimegnon v. Or. Health and Sci. Univ., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125807, 2017 WL 3429394 (D. Or. Aug. 8, 2017) (concluding ORS 659A.199 is limited to claims against private employers); see also Nichol v. City of Springfield, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82990, 2016 WL 3512071 (D. Or. June 27, 2016); Bieker v. City of Portland, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91480, 2016 WL 3769753 at *4 (D. Or. July 14, 2016); Peters v. Betaseed, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162443, 2012 WL 5503617 (D. Or. Nov. 9, 2012).
The [*18]  reasoning of these decisions is persuasive. ORS 659A.199 does not apply to the District, a public employer. Accordingly, the District is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

IV. Whistleblower Claim Under ORS 659A.230 (Fourth Claim)
In order to survive summary judgment on a statutory whistleblower retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show the existence of facts from which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that it engaged in the protected activity and that the defendants retaliated against it in response to that activity. Franklin v. Clarke, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102231, 2011 WL 4024638 at *9 (D. Or. Sept. 9, 2011). Here, the District alleges that Grant's report of her injury does not rise to the level of a protected activity, and in any event, there is no evidence of retaliation for the filing of that report.
First, this court agrees that the injury report made by Grant on October 15, 2015, is not the type of activity protected by the whistleblowing statute at 659A.230. The clear purpose of the statute is to protect employees who initiate or aid in a civil or criminal proceeding. Ransom v HBE Corp., 73 Fed. Appx. 919, 2003 WL 21949158 (9th Cir. 2003). "So not just any statement concerning criminal activity will trigger the protections of section 659A.230(1)." 73 Fed. Appx. 919, Id. at *2. In Ransom, the court found, "as there is no evidence in the record that Ransom's internal complaints [ ] were intended [*19]  to or likely to result in notifying law enforcement of the allegedly illegal asbestos on the site, no reasonable jury could conclude that a 'report[ ] of criminal activity' was made." Ransom, 73 Fed. Appx. 919, 2003 WL 21949158, at *2; see also Roche v. La Cie, Ltd., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114500, 2009 WL 4825419 at *7 (D. Or. 2009) (" [the] protected activity analysis should focus on whether, under the specific facts of the case, the complainant's "report" is intended to or likely to result in a criminal or civil proceeding.")
Analogously, Grant's internal report made the day after the incident cannot be construed as an initiation of a criminal proceeding. Even if one could argue that a four-year-old child acting out on the playground could constitute criminal activity, no reasonable trier of fact could find that plaintiff's intention in filing an internal incident report was to initiate a criminal process. There is no evidence from which a jury could conclude that Grant's report to Howell, or her completion of the paperwork documenting the incident, was intended to initiate anything other than workers' compensation coverage for the on-the-job injury she sustained. The incident report states that it is "to be completed by the injured employee at the time of the accident, signed by his/her supervisor the same day as the [*20]  accident, and sent immediately to the Payroll Department." Snyder Decl., Ex. 1, ECF 22-1. It also contains a medical records release. Id. Nothing in the record supports the proposition that Howell (or any other District employee) is entrusted with receiving and acting on reports of criminal activity. Thus, Grant's claim that she thought Howell would contact the police is unavailing; and certainly she could have filed a police report at any time if she believed the child's conduct was criminal.
Grant's ORS 659A.230 claim is further deficient because there is no causation between the incident report and the termination. See James v. Or. Sandblasting and Coating, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131087, 2016 WL 5402218 (D. Or. Sept 25, 2016) (denying the protection of 659A.230 where plaintiff could not show he suffered an adverse employment decision as a result.) The Ninth Circuit has upheld dismissals on summary judgment where there was no evidence from which a rational juror could conclude that a complaint caused termination or any other alleged adverse action. Gamez-Morales v. Pacific Northwest Renal Servs., LLC, 304 Fed. Appx. 572, 2008 WL 5341988, at *2 (9th Cir. 2008).
Here, there is no evidence from which a jury could infer that Grant was fired for filing the October 15, 2016 incident report. Grant does not assert in her response to the motion for summary judgment that she was discharged for filing a report, and fails [*21]  to point the court to any evidence to support that contention. Resp. Mot. Summ. J. 33-34, ECF #21. To the contrary, the evidence presented demonstrates an initial effort by the District to make accommodations by assigning Grant to light duty immediately following the completion of the incident report. While there is an issue of fact as to whether the expense or the inconvenience of Grant's injury were substantial factors in the decision to terminate her employment, there is no evidence that the mere filing of the incident report was a factor, and therefore there is no requisite causal link to sustain a whistleblower claim under this section.

V. Injured Worker Discrimination Under ORS 659A.040 (Fifth Claim)
In her fifth claim, Grant alleges that she was terminated in violation of ORS 659A.040, which prohibits discrimination against an employee for invoking the protections of Oregon's workers' compensation laws. As it does with respect to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, the District contends that it is entitled to summary judgment against the fifth claim because Grant was fired for misconduct, not for invoking the workers' compensation system. As explained above, however, a disputed issue of material fact [*22]  exists regarding the reasons the District terminated Grant's employment. Thus, this court should deny the District's motion to the extent it is directed against the fifth claim.

VI. Wrongful Termination (Seventh Claim)
The District contends it is entitled to summary judgment against Grant's wrongful termination claim because she has adequate statutory remedies that preclude a common law claim for wrongful discharge. See, e.g., Huitt v. Optum Health Servs., 216 F. Supp. 3d 1179, 1197 (D. Or. November 1, 2016) ("Courts in this district have held § 659A.230 provides an adequate statutory remedy, which precludes a claim for wrongful termination."); Rinallo v. Capsa Sols., LLC, 222 F.Supp.3d 927, 933 (D. Or. 2016) (precluding claim to the extent that it is based on the same conduct that underlies the claim for violation of § 659A.199; i.e., reporting sexual harassment). As discussed above, Grant cannot seek a statutory remedy under ORS 659A.199 (Third Claim) or ORS 659A.230 (Fourth Claim), and therefore the wrongful termination claim is not barred.1
Instead, summary judgment against the seventh claim should be granted for the reasons discussed in Section IV above, pertaining to ORS 659A.230. The common law claim is premised upon the same allegation that it was wrongful for the District to terminate her "because she was performing a public duty and/or fulfilling a societal obligation [by] [*23]  reporting unlawful and/or criminal conduct in the workplace . . . ." Compl. ¶ 68, ECF #1. As discussed above, there is no evidence from which a jury could infer that Grant was fired for filing the October 15, 2015 incident report. Accordingly, the District's request for summary judgment against the seventh claim should be granted.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The District's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF #14) should be GRANTED as against the Third, Fourth, and Seventh Claims, and otherwise DENIED.
