Opinion



ORDER
Aleta Mack, the pro se plaintiff in this matter, is a young professional who suffers from Type II diabetes, anxiety disorder and hearing loss/tinnitus. Here, at summary judgment, there is no dispute that plaintiff has these conditions;1 but what is hotly contested is whether plaintiff's employer, CGI Federal, Inc. (hereinafter, "CGI"), discriminated or retaliated against her because of any disability she may have or for engaging in protected activity.
Following discovery, the filing of defendant's summary judgment motion, and the parties' oral arguments, it is now clear that plaintiff does not possess any admissible record evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find (i) that CGI refused reasonable requests for accommodation, (ii) that CGI discriminated against her on the basis of her disability or (iii) that CGI retaliated against her for engaging in protected activity. Because plaintiff cannot [*2]  prove the elements of any of her claims with admissible record evidence, summary judgment must be entered on behalf of CGI.

I.
Although unnecessary to the resolution of this dispute, plaintiff's recent employment history provides informative context to the facts and issues presented here. Specifically, over the past three years plaintiff has followed a familiar employment pattern: first, she accepts employment; shortly thereafter she requests reasonable accommodations for her disabilities from her employer; then when those requests are granted by her employer she escalates her requests for accommodations until her employer is required to deny her unreasonable requests; she then stops coming to work leading to her termination or resignation; and then she ultimately sues her employer for discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. This case is remarkably similar to two cases that Plaintiff previously filed against other employers. See Aleta Mack v. Lockheed Martin Corp., Civil Case No. 8:16-cv-03744 (D. Md.); Aleta Mack v. Georgetown University, Civil Case No. 15-cv-793 (D.D.C.). Nevertheless, an individualized inquiry into the particular [*3]  facts of this case is appropriate and necessary.
Local Rule 56 requires a defendant to set forth its statement of undisputed fact in separately numbered paragraphs. E.D. Va. Loc. R. Civ. P. 56(B). CGI complied with this requirement by setting forth its statement of material facts in fifty-five (55) separately numbered paragraphs. Plaintiff, however, did not comply with the Local Rule because she failed to respond to each of CGI's statements of material fact. Moreover, in order to establish a disputed fact, plaintiff must cite legally admissible record evidence that contradicts defendant's asserted undisputed fact(s).2 Plaintiff failed to do this as well. In the circumstances presented here, where plaintiff has failed to comply with the rule, it is appropriate to "assume that [the] facts identified by the moving party in its listing of material facts are admitted." Id. This was not done, though; instead, the record was scoured to determine whether any facts — beyond plaintiff's self-serving statements in a sham affidavit — create a triable issue for a jury.
The facts of this summary judgment record are as follows:3
• CGI provides information technology consulting services to the federal government through contracts with [*4]  various federal agencies.
• On February 26, 2016, CGI offered plaintiff a position as a Project Administrator. She was assigned to provide onsite administrative support for CGI's contracts with the Department of State ("DOS") and the United States Agency for International Development ("USAID").
• The essential functions of plaintiff's job as a project administrator included performing orientation and training activities for new employees; escorting visitors through security; ordering and taking delivery of office supplies; preparing the office for meetings and events; preparing office work areas for new team members; collecting and scanning daily sign-in sheets; reconciling sign-in sheets and invoices and resolving discrepancies; and performing DOS security training.
• On March 23, 2016, plaintiff completed a Voluntary Self Identification of Disability Form but did not request any accommodations.
• Plaintiff began working for CGI on March 28, 2016.
• On April 19, 2016, plaintiff opened a case with CGI's HR Service Center and requested "reasonable accommodations due to my medical conditions." At that time, however, plaintiff did not identify any particular disabilities or any specific accommodation [*5]  requests.
• On April 27, 2016, plaintiff sent an email to her supervisors, Cristina Watschke (USAID) and Monica Rao (DOS), requesting accommodations for her hearing loss/tinnitus and Type II Diabetes. Specifically, plaintiff requested that CGI provide her with noise-cancelling headphones to help with her hearing loss/tinnitus and a compact refrigerator to help her regulate her Type II diabetes.
• CGI granted both requests.
• On May 24, 2016, Richard J. Simons, plaintiff's physician, submitted an ADA Medical Inquiry Form relating to plaintiff's anxiety. Dr. Simons identified her limitations as interacting with others, concentrating, and excessive worrying.
• Dr. Simons suggested that "[i]t would be helpful for [plaintiff] to be at one site for 4 days at a time" and that it would also be helpful for her to receive tasks in writing.
• On June 9, 2016, Sid Getz, Vice President, Consulting Services for CGI, and Ms. Rao met with plaintiff to discuss her accommodation requests. Mr. Getz told plaintiff that CGI would provide both of the accommodations recommended by her doctor, and that the "one site for 4 days at a time" would be at the DOS.
• In response to Mr. Getz's offers of accommodation, [*6]  plaintiff asked whether she could work four days at USAID instead of DOS.
• Mr. Getz explained that plaintiff needed to work four days at the DOS because the bulk of her work was there.
• plaintiff stated that if she was going to be at the DOS four days a week, she wanted her own private office.
• On June 10, 2016, Mr. Getz, Ms. Watschke, and Ms. Lewis, an HR consultant at CGI, met with plaintiff for further discussion of her accommodation requests. They told plaintiff that CGI could not provide a private office to her because all of the private offices that were made available to CGI at the DOS were occupied by senior level managers and executives.
• On July 5, 2016, Mr. Getz, Ms. Lewis, and Som Saadat, Vice President, Consulting Services, met with plaintiff to issue her a written warning for an interaction she had with Ms. Rao on June 20th. The warning stated that plaintiff had been disrespectful and had refused to perform her assigned tasks.
• On July 6, 2016 at 12:20 a.m., hours after receiving the written warning, plaintiff sent an email to her supervisors noting that she left work on July 5th "with a pounding headache and elevated ringing in [her] left ear" and, as a result, she would [*7]  not be able to report to work.
• On July 6, 2016 at 10:02 p.m., plaintiff sent an email to Ms. Watschke and Ms. Lewis notifying them of her "immediate medical leave from 7/6/16 - 7/13/16 due to [her] heightened anxieties after yesterday's meeting."
• On or about August 10, 2016, plaintiff's physician, Ashkan Monfared, M.D., submitted an ADA Medical Inquiry Form relating to her hearing loss and tinnitus. He identified her limitations as difficulty sleeping, difficulty hearing, and difficulty concentrating, and suggested that she be provided with headphones, the use of text and/or instant messaging to communicate, a quiet room, and permission to listen to soft music or "white noise." He also indicated that plaintiff would benefit from a "hearing assistive device."
• On or about August 23, 2016, Mr. Getz and plaintiff met to discuss her doctor's recommendations. During that meeting, plaintiff requested that CGI purchase Bose noise-cancelling headphones for her.
• On September 14, 2016, plaintiff informed Mr. Getz that she no longer wanted the Bose headphones but instead wanted a hearing assistive device.
• On September 15, 2016, plaintiff sent Mr. Getz an email requesting that she be permitted [*8]  to telework on certain days and that she be given a "quiet room" at the DOS.
• Mr. Getz responded, informing plaintiff that she could not telework because her duties required her to be on-site. Mr. Getz also explained that CGI did not have any space at DOS that would be any quieter than where Plaintiff already worked.
• On September 16, 2016, plaintiff sent Mr. Getz an email and asked whether CGI would be willing to remove her "non-essential" job functions during the invoice reconciliation process to accommodate her hearing loss and tinnitus. She did not identify the specific functions she considered to be "non-essential."
• On September 23, 2016, Mr. Getz informed plaintiff that CGI was willing to acquire a hearing assistive device to help with her hearing loss/tinnitus.
• On September 28, 2016, plaintiff informed Mr. Getz that the device he had selected would be "satisfactory to accommodate her need."
• On October 5, 2016, Mr. Getz sent plaintiff an email informing her that CGI considered her responsibility for the daily sign-in sheet to be an essential part of her job and that that task could not be reassigned to other employees.
• Plaintiff responded on October 5th and asked to be given [*9]  three full days to perform the invoice reconciliation process as an accommodation for her hearing loss/tinnitus and further requested that all of her other duties be reassigned to other employees during those three day periods.
• Mr. Getz reminded plaintiff that CGI had agreed to help prioritize her tasks, not eliminate them.
• Later that evening, plaintiff sent an email to Ms. Watschke, Ms. Rao, Mr. Getz, and Ms. Hopper notifying them that she left work that day "with a pounding headache and increased anxieties" and that she would not be at work the following day.
• On October 14, 2016 at 7:06 a.m., plaintiff sent an email to Ms. Hopper noting that she had "increased anxiety about going into work" because of "loud sounds" in her work area. She reiterated her request either to telework or to be given a "quiet work area."
• On or about October 17, 2016, Dr. Simons submitted a second Medical Inquiry Form relating to plaintiff's anxiety. He noted that plaintiff's "workplace environment" was "aggravating her anxiety because of interruptions in her work flow and competitive tasks placed on her." He suggested that Plaintiff "be given the opportunity to telework from home, if at all possible." [*10] 
• On October 19, 2016, plaintiff notified Ms. Hopper that she was unable to report to work due to "increased anxieties and an uneasiness" based on "continuous loud sounds" in her work area at the DOS.
• On October 25, 2016, plaintiff sent an email requesting a private or semi-private office. She identified two options and noted that the "loud noise" could not be heard in either location.
• Later on October 25th Mr. Getz informed plaintiff that her request for a private or semi-private work space had been granted. Plaintiff was told that she was being moved to one of the work locations she had requested.
• On October 31, 2016, plaintiff sent an email to Mr. Getz, Ms. Watschke, and Ms. Rao stating that she was "experiencing headaches from the loud thumping noise" from construction work being performed outside the USAID building. She asked to be permitted to telework on days construction was scheduled.
• On November 2, 2016, Mr. Getz sent Ms. Hopper an email reiterating the necessity of having plaintiff on site.
• Plaintiff sent an email to her supervisors every morning from November 4th through 15th, 2016 notifying them that she would be out due to "personal illness."
• On November 14, 2016, [*11]  Ms. Watschke noted that plaintiff had taken 159.7 hours of sick leave since starting with the company in March 2016.
• On November 16, 2016, after being out for almost 2 weeks, plaintiff submitted a note from her doctor, Benjamin Blatt, M.D., excusing her from work retroactively to November 4th and forward through November 28th based on "general anxiety disorder."
• On or about November 21, 2016, Ms. Hopper sent a letter to plaintiff detailing the accommodations she had been provided, which included noise-canceling headphones and a mini-refrigerator, and reviewing plaintiff's her options going forward.
• On November 24, 2016, plaintiff notified Ms. Hopper that she had received 2 copies of the November 21st letter and found them to be "excessive forms of communication." Plaintiff claimed that "[t]hese threatening duplicate letters have succeed[ed] in compounding my anxieties while I am off sick."
• On November 28, 2016, plaintiff contacted Ms. Hopper to notify her that she had an "anxiety relapse" after receiving Ms. Hopper's "threatening letters" and would be out "until my doctor releases me to return to work."
• On December 19, 2016, having been absent since November 4th, plaintiff notified [*12]  CGI that she expected to return to work on January 23, 2017.
• On December 23, 2016, CGI engaged a temporary employee to perform the functions of plaintiff's position.
• Under its contract with the DOS, CGI is required to obtain approval before implementing any staffing changes. Additionally, the DOS must approve the return of any employees who take leave longer than 1 month or a full invoice period.
• DOS approved CGI's request to hire a temporary employee, but denied CGI's request to allow plaintiff to return to her position at the conclusion of her leave.
• On December 28, 2016, Ms. Hopper notified plaintiff that CGI could not permit her to return to her position at DOS because DOS had disapproved of Plaintiff's return.
• However, Ms. Hopper informed plaintiff that CGI would provide plaintiff with assistance in finding a new position within CGI when she returned from leave. In particular, she would be given 4 weeks of assistance from CGI's Workforce Management to identify a new position.
• On January 6, 2017, plaintiff notified CGI that her expected date of return was being pushed back again to February 1, 2017.
• After receiving this email, Ms. Hopper reminded plaintiff that she needed [*13]  to work with CGI's Workforce Management group when she returned to find a new position. Plaintiff replied that she wanted to be returned to her former position.
• On January 13, 2017, Ms. Hopper reiterated that plaintiff could not return to her prior position.
• In response, plaintiff accused CGI of discriminating against her.
• On February 1, 2017, George Cannon, Workforce Management Specialist, contacted Plaintiff to provide her with an overview of the internal job search process. Mr. Cannon advised plaintiff of her responsibilities in the process, including ensuring that her resume was updated.
• Mr. Cannon contacted plaintiff on numerous occasions and asked her to update her resume.
• Plaintiff replied and stated that she had provided Human Resources with a copy of her resume in February 2016 — one year earlier.
• On February 16, 2017, Mr. Cannon responded and noted that he had requested that she provide him with an updated resume "multiple times," but she had not done so. Mr. Cannon even offered to gather information from plaintiff verbally and to create a new resume for her. Plaintiff refused this offer.
• On March 2, 2017, after plaintiff was unable to secure a new position within [*14]  CGI, Ms. Hopper notified her that she could remain employed and take an unpaid leave of absence while she continued to search internally for jobs.
• Plaintiff declined CGI's offer of an unpaid leave of absence, and her employment with CGI was terminated on March 2, 2017.
• Plaintiff began working for her new employer, Inspection Experts, Inc., on March 6, 2017.
• On March 16, 2017, plaintiff filed a multiple claim complaint against CGI attempting to state the following four causes of action under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act: (i) failure to accommodate, (ii) disparate treatment, (iii) hostile work environment, and (iv) retaliation.
• Only three of plaintiff's claims survived CGI's motion to dismiss: (i) failure to accommodate, (ii) disparate treatment, and (iii) retaliation.
Now that discovery is complete and defendant's motion for summary judgment has been fully briefed and argued, this matter is ripe for disposition.

II.
The standard governing review of summary judgment motions is too well-settled to warrant extensive discussion. Under Rule 56, Fed. R. Civ. P., summary judgment is appropriate only where there is "no genuine dispute as to any material fact" such that the moving party "is entitled to judgment [*15]  as a matter of law." Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A genuine dispute exists if "there is sufficient evidence on which a reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). In evaluating this question, courts must "view the evidence in the light most favorable to... the nonmovant." Dennis v. Columbia Colleton Med. Ctr., Inc., 290 F.3d 639, 645 (4th Cir. 2002). The nonmovant, however, cannot rely on "mere allegations;" rather, the nonmovant "must set forth specific facts that go beyond the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." Glynn v. EDO Corp., 710 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal quotations and citations omitted).

III.
This is a straightforward case. The summary judgment record makes abundantly clear that there is no admissible evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find in favor of plaintiff on her accommodation, disparate treatment, or retaliation claims.

A.
For plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim to survive summary judgment, she must point to legally admissible evidence that could establish each of the following elements: (1) that she was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (2) that her employer had notice of her disability; (3) that she could perform the essential functions of her position with reasonable accommodation(s); and (4) that her employer refused to [*16]  make such accommodations. See Rhoads v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n. 11 (4th Cir.2001); Ainsworth v. Loudon Cty. Sch. Bd., 851 F. Supp. 2d 963, 980 (E.D. Va. 2012). Plaintiff can point to no evidence that establishes the third or fourth elements of a prima facie case for failure to accommodate. This is so because it is crystal clear that CGI made every reasonable effort to accommodate plaintiff's claimed conditions.
Plaintiff made many accommodation requests of CGI. She requested noise-cancelling headphones, a personal refrigerator, a private workspace, a hearing assistive device, and the opportunity to work in one location four days per week. CGI granted all of these requests promptly and without protest. The only two accommodation requests CGI denied were plaintiff's request to telework and plaintiff's request to have the duties she described as "non-essential" reassigned to other employees.
It is well-established that "an employee who does not come to work cannot perform any of [her] job functions, essential or otherwise." EEOC v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., 253 F.3d 943, 948 (7th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (quoting Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994). It is also commonly understood that "[many] jobs require the kind of teamwork, personal interaction, and supervision that simply cannot be had in a home office situation." E.E.O.C. v. Ford Motor Co., 782 F.3d 753, 761 (6th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (quoting Rauen v. U.S. Tobacco Mfg. L.P., 319 F.3d 891, 896 (7th Cir. 2003)). Plaintiff's job was such a job. The undisputed record demonstrates that plaintiff's [*17]  job responsibilities at CGI included: performing orientation and training activities for new employees; escorting visitors through security; ordering and taking delivery of office supplies; preparing the office for meetings and events; preparing office work areas for new team members; collecting and scanning daily sign-in sheets; reconciling sign-in sheets and invoices and resolving discrepancies; and performing DOS security training. These were essential functions of plaintiff's job, most of which could not be performed from home.4
The EEOC's guidance on the subject of telecommuting is instructive here. Although the EEOC has recognized that telework may be a reasonable accommodation in some situations, the EEOC has also endorsed employer's denial of telecommuting when, among other things, the employee's job requires "face-to-face interaction and coordination of work with other employees," "in-person interaction with outside colleagues, clients, or customers," and "immediate access to documents or other information located only in the workplace." EEOC Fact Sheet, Work At Home/Telework as a Reasonable Accommodation (Dec. 20, 2017), http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html. The EEOC's guidance [*18]  makes perfect sense. Food servers, teachers, police officers, cashiers, and truck drivers, to name a few, cannot perform their essential duties from home. In contrast, a web designer, engineer, architect or transactional lawyer may well be able to perform the essential functions of his or her job from home. Therefore, the reasonableness of a request to telecommute turns on the nature of the employee's job.
Naturally, the heart of any ADA failure to accommodate analysis is whether the essential functions of the job can be performed with the requested accommodation.5 In this case, plaintiff could not escort visitors through security, delivery office supplies, prepare offices for meetings and events, or collect and scan the daily sign-in sheets from her home. Therefore, telecommuting was not a reasonable accommodation request because plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her position outside the office.
The only other accommodation request that CGI denied was plaintiff's request to have non-essential duties reassigned to other employees. Essentially, plaintiff only wanted to perform one of her essential functions: the invoice reconciliation process, which she wanted to perform from home. She wanted her fellow employees to absorb all of her other responsibilities. Unfortunately for plaintiff, the ADA does not require an employer to "reallocate essential functions" to accommodate an employee with a disability. Credeur v. Louisiana Through Office of Attorney Gen., 860 F.3d 785, 795 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing 29 C.F.R. § Pt. 1630, app. at 399); see also E.E.O.C. v. Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, LLP, 616 F. App'x 588, 595 (4th Cir. 2015)("[R]equiring assistance for all tasks that involve lifting more than 20 pounds would reallocate essential functions, which the ADA does not require."); Phelps v. Optima Health, Inc., 251 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2001) ("Although a reasonable accommodation may include job restructuring, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B), an employer need not exempt an employee from performing essential functions, nor need it reallocate essential functions to other employees."). Because [*20]  plaintiff wanted CGI to reassign the vast majority of her essential duties and the ADA does not require an employer to take such a preposterous step, her failure to accommodate claim fails.
For all these reasons, summary judgment must be entered in favor of CGI as to plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim.

B.
To avoid summary judgment on her disparate treatment claim, plaintiff must, as a threshold matter, establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The elements of a prima facie case for disparate treatment are: (1) the plaintiff she has a disability; (2) the plaintiff is otherwise qualified for the employment; and (3) the plaintiff was excluded from that employment due to discrimination solely on the basis of her disability. See Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cty., Maryland, 789 F.3d 407, 418 (4th Cir. 2015) (citing Doe v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1264-65 (4th Cir. 1995)). Here, plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination; the undisputed factual record establishes that she was unqualified to perform her job at CGI and that she voluntarily left her employment despite CGI's best efforts to keep her employed.
As an initial matter, there is no evidence on this record that plaintiff was qualified for her employment with CGI. In determining whether a plaintiff is a "qualified individual" for [*21]  employment, the Fourth Circuit has instructed lower courts to consider "whether that person is able to perform the essential functions of the job in question." Watson v. Fairfax Cty., Virginia, 297 F. Supp. 3d 591, 601 (E.D. Va. 2018) (quoting Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281-82 (4th Cir. 1995)). Here, it is painfully obvious that Plaintiff was incapable of performing the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation.
The summary judgment record reveals that plaintiff received negative performance reviews and several warnings regarding her personal conduct during her time at CGI. Additionally, over the course of her year-long tenure with CGI, plaintiff was absent from work 100 days out of 260 possible work days.6 In other words, plaintiff was not at work for 40% of the time she worked at CGI. In this circuit, it is beyond dispute that "[i]n addition to possessing the skills necessary to perform the job in question, an employee must be willing and able to demonstrate those skills by coming to work on a regular basis." Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., Inc. of Cali., 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994). Plaintiff barely came to work at all and therefore she was not fulfilling her employer's legitimate, non-discriminatory expectations.
In addition to plaintiff being unqualified for her position at CGI, she has also failed to produce any evidence that she was excluded [*22]  from employment because of any discriminatory animus. In fact, plaintiff has not produced any evidence that CGI excluded her from employment at all. To the contrary, the record reveals that CGI implored plaintiff to engage with their Workforce Management Department to find her another job at CGI. CGI's Workforce Specialist, George Cannon, went so far as to offer to create plaintiff's an updated resume. Plaintiff refused to take advantage of any offered assistance or to engage with CGI in any way — presumably because remaining employed at CGI would complicate her long-standing plans to sue CGI.
In sum, this record does not reveal that plaintiff was discharged or constructively discharged; instead it reveals that she had no intention of returning to CGI and that she voluntarily disengaged from CGI.7 Moreover, there is absolutely no evidence of discriminatory animus on the part of CGI.
For these reasons, summary judgment must be entered in favor of CGI on plaintiff's disparate treatment/discriminatory discharge claim.

C.
Finally, to reach a jury on her ADA retaliation claim, plaintiff must point to admissible record evidence that establishes each of the following elements: "(1) that [plaintiff] [*23]  engaged in protected conduct, (2) that [plaintiff] suffered an adverse action, and (3) that a causal link exists between the protected conduct and the adverse action." A Soc'y Without A Name v. Virginia, 655 F.3d 342, 350 (4th Cir. 2011). Here, plaintiff clearly engaged in protected conduct by requesting ADA accommodations. However, for the same reasons stated above, there is no evidence that plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, or in the alternative, that her departure from CGI was in any way related to her protected activity.
This record is clear that CGI genuinely sought to keep plaintiff employed by offering her extended paid leave and by offering her significant logistical support to find a new position within the company. Importantly, CGI could not control the fact that the State Department precluded Plaintiff from returning to her former job; but a part from CGI's lack of authority to countermand the State Department's directive, CGI did everything in its power to keep plaintiff employed at CGI. In contrast, plaintiff did everything in her power to leave. Because plaintiff voluntarily left her employment at CGI, there was no adverse employment action.
To the extent that plaintiff did suffer an adverse employment action by not being [*24]  able to return to her position at the State Department, there is no causal connection between that adverse action and plaintiff's protected activity. CGI had no control over the State Department's decision to preclude Plaintiff from returning to the premises. Moreover, CGI's efforts to keep plaintiff employed extended eleven months after she made her first request for accommodation under the ADA, belying any inference that plaintiff's employment was changed or altered because of her protected activity.
For all these reasons, summary judgment must also be entered on behalf of CGI on plaintiff's retaliation claim.

IV.
In addition to CGI's summary judgment motion, the parties have filed several other motions. All of these motions have been rendered moot by this decision except for CGI's motion for sanctions. CGI has requested that sanctions be imposed against plaintiff for her discovery abuses, specifically skipping her scheduled deposition without warning or justification. Plaintiff responded to this motion by stating that she skipped her deposition because she had a "heightened anxiety episode," after appearing before Magistrate Judge Nachmanoff the morning of her deposition. She further [*25]  states that she left the courthouse to seek "urgent medical treatment from the MedStar Prompt Care Facility in Alexandria, Virginia." This statement is a patent mistruth. Plaintiff did not immediately leave the courthouse to seek urgent medical attention following her hearing with Magistrate Judge Nachmanoff; instead, she stormed into Courtroom 900 during the morning docket and waited nearly an hour before leaving — presumably to complain about Magistrate Judge Nachmanoff. It was during the time plaintiff spent in the undersigned's courtroom that she was supposed to be preparing for and attending her deposition.
After reviewing this record, it is clearly appropriate to sanction plaintiff for her discovery abuses pursuant to Rule 37, Fed. R. Civ. P. Because plaintiff failed to appear at her first deposition for no justifiable reason, the Court finds it appropriate to sanction plaintiff in the amount of $330.00 — the amount of fees expended by CGI for its attorneys to attend the aborted deposition.
At this time, CGI has not moved for the imposition of any other sanctions related to other discovery abuses — including plaintiff failing to meaningfully participate in her second deposition. CGI has also not moved [*26]  for any Rule 11 sanctions. If any such motions are filed, they will be considered at a later date.

V.
For all the reasons set forth above,
It is hereby ORDERED that CGI's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 145) is GRANTED.
It is further ORDERED that CGI's motion for sanctions (Doc. 112) is GRANTED. Plaintiff must pay defendant $330.00. If plaintiff does not make timely payments, interest will accrue at the statutory rate.
It is further ORDERED that all other motions are DENIED AS MOOT.
The Clerk of Court is directed to send a copy of this Order to the plaintiff at her last known address and to all counsel of record.
The Clerk is further directed to enter Rule 58 judgment on behalf of CGI in the amount of $330.00, and to place this matter among the ended causes.
