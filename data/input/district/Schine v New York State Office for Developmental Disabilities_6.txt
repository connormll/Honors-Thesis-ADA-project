REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
LOCKE, Magistrate Judge:
Presently before the Court in this disability discrimination litigation, on referral from the Honorable Sandra J. Feuerstein, is a Motion for a Judgment on the Pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) ("Rule 12(c)") filed by Defendants the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities ("OPWDD") and Kerry Delaney ("Delaney"), in her official capacity as Acting Commissioner for OPWDD (collectively "Defendants"). See Docket Entry ("DE") [21]. Plaintiff Dwight Gregory Schine ("Plaintiff" or "Schine") opposes the motion. See DE [18]. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court respectfully recommends that Defendants' motion be denied in its entirety.

I. Background [*2] 

A. Relevant Facts
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff is a 51-year old developmentally disabled man. See DE [1], Complaint ("Compl.") at ¶ 2. Although New York State has classified Plaintiffs disabilities as requiring constant monitoring and placement in an Intermediate Care Facility for the Intellectually Disabled, Plaintiff has instead elected, as is his right, to utilize a Home and Community Based Services ("HCBS") approach through which he receives his care and services while living semi-independently in the community. See id. at ¶¶ 23-26.
Under HCBS, Plaintiff currently lives alone in a studio apartment, the cost of which is subsidized by the state. Id. at ¶¶ 24-27. Schine is wholly dependent upon his state-sponsored caregivers for any and all of his outside and interpersonal contact, as well as his personal needs, including, but not limited to shopping, cooking, and transportation to any and all treatment/services he is receiving. See id. According to the Complaint, Plaintiffs state-approved and state-subsidized living situation has substantially contributed to Schine's deterioration. See id. at ¶¶ 27-38, 77-87. The small size of the apartment is allegedly causing Schine to suffer [*3]  symptoms of claustrophobia, which, in turn, are negatively impacting his underlying mental health, specifically regarding his anxiety level, the frequency of his panic attacks, and his overall social estrangement. See id. at ¶¶ 27-38. This decompensation has caused Plaintiff to discharge approximately seventeen different caregivers that were hired through HCBS. Id. at ¶33. As Schine also suffers from various degrees of paranoia and a diagnosed personality disorder, the constant stream of new caregivers attempting to come into his home has led to a cycle of increased isolation and further deterioration. Id. In light of Plaintiff's increasing inability to receive adequate services under the current state program, the Complaint alleges that Schine is now at a significantly higher risk of being institutionalized. Id. at ¶ 33.
In hopes of preventing this, Stephen Short, Plaintiff's friend, located an independent living facility known as the Atria Enriched Housing Program ("Atria"). Id. at ¶ 39. According to the Complaint, Atria provides comparable services to HCBS but in a non-institutionalized, residential setting that offers Plaintiff the possibility of greater stability in the provision [*4]  of his care with a diversity of environments that would foster more companionship, socialization, and meaningful interactions with the community. Id. at ¶¶ 42-53. With Schine no longer dependent on individuals whom he perceives to be strangers for his support and services, Plaintiff maintains that his mental health could improve; meaningful, consistent access to those services would be possible; and his risk of institutionalization would be reduced significantly. Id. Plaintiff alleges that OPWDD has already determined that Atria is an appropriate living situation for Schine and an acceptable setting for his continued participation in the HCBS waiver program, the same program that is currently allowing him to remain in the community. Id. at ¶55.
To allow him to relocate to Atria, on October 24, 2014, Plaintiff petitioned OPWDD, the New York State entity charged with the care of Plaintiff and those similarly situated to him, to modify his Personal Resource Account Self-Direction Budget ("PRA-SD Budget"). Id. at ¶¶ 56-66; see Plaintiffs Memorandum of Law in Opposition ("Pl. Mem.") at 2-5. A PRA-SD Budget funds/subsidizes Schine's care and placement in the community as part of HCBS. See [*5]  id.; Compl. at ¶¶ 10-11. In 2014, for the care and treatment of Plaintiff, New York State allocated through his PRA-SD Budget $92,938, which included $54,574 to hire care providers, $4,000 for transportation, $1,750 for "support brokeraging," $13,596 as a housing subsidy, and a $2,000 boarding stipend. Compl. at ¶¶ 53-54. Due to Schine's deterioration, on August 12, 2015 his budget was increased to $113,345. See Plaintiffs Exhibit ("Pl. Ex.") A. Plaintiff maintains that the total cost of Atria, which would provide most of these services, along with housing and board, is $62,452 per year. Compl. at ¶ 54. Nevertheless, OPWDD denied Schine's request for a waiver, which, Plaintiff alleges, could have re-allocated funding within his already-approved PRA-SD Budget to enable Schine to afford relocation to Atria. Id. at ¶¶56-58.
The primary reason that Defendants rejected Plaintiffs request for a waiver that would have allowed him to utilize his budget to pay for the costs associated with living at Atria is that OPWDD has only approved a housing subsidy of $1,339 per month, while Atria's total expenses are $5,121 per month. Id. Though only a portion of this monthly cost at Atria is for actually [*6]  housing Plaintiff, with the remainder going to board and services, Defendants classify Atria's total monthly charges only as housing and have refused to allow other categories of expenditures to be applied to it. Id. at 63-65.

B. Procedural History
After losing a state-level administrative appeal of OPWDD's decision, Plaintiff filed this action. See Compl.; Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Support Motion to Dismiss ("Def. Mem. of Law") at 3. In his Complaint, Schine alleges that Defendants' conduct violated the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1), "by administering its mental health service system in a manner that denies Plaintiff, a person with developmental and intellectual disabilities ... the opportunity to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to his needs." See id. at ¶¶ 79-81. Plaintiff claims that Defendants' conduct "constitute[s] discrimination in violation of title II of the ADA ... and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Part 35." Id. Additionally, under Count 2, Schine alleges that Defendants, as recipients of federal financial assistance, by their denial of Plaintiff's requests, have discriminated against a "qualified individual with a disability" within the meaning of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation [*7]  Act ("Section 504"); 29 U.S.C. § 794, 45 C.F.R. § 84.4; by "administering programs and services for individuals with mental illness in a manner that denies individuals the opportunity to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs." See id. at ¶¶ 85-87.
Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to find that Defendants have committed the aforementioned violations of the two statutes and compelling them to grant a waiver to Plaintiff as would allow him to relocate to Atria. Id. at 15-16. Plaintiff also seeks payment of reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Id. at 16.
On December 12, 2015 Defendants answered the Complaint, and, subsequently, on August 29, 2016, they filed their Rule 12(c) motion, which is presently before the Court. See DE [10], [21].

C. Defendant's Rule 12(c) Motion
At the heart of Defendant's motion is the argument that even if the allegations contained in the Complaint are true, Plaintiff fails to state a cognizable claim upon which the Court would be empowered to grant relief under Title II of the ADA or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See Def. Mem. of Law at 1-2, 4-8. Defendants argue that whether placement in Atria is beneficial to Plaintiff and whether it comes at a lower overall cost to New York [*8]  State is irrelevant. See id. 5-7. OPWDD's denial of Plaintiff's request, as a matter of law, cannot be deemed discriminatory because granting it would entail the conferral of new substantive rights upon Schine rather than a reasonable accommodation of his disability. See Defendants' Reply Memorandum of Law ("Def. Reply") at 2-3. According to Defendants, rather than alleging discrimination, Plaintiff essentially disputes the level of his benefits, misapprehending the non-fungible nature of the monies at issue. Def. Mem. of Law at 6-7. Defendants further maintain that Plaintiff's request is improper because New York State would likely not be eligible for federal reimbursement for any of Plaintiff's increased room and board subsidies that living at Atria would entail. See id. Consequently, under either statute, Defendants maintain that Schine does not identify any relevant obligations that they have failed to meet by providing services to Plaintiff in the same manner as they would any other similarly situated disabled person living alone in the community. See Def. Reply at 4. For Defendants', the individualized meaningfulness of the access to services HCBS offers Plaintiff and its overall effectiveness [*9]  is not a pertinent line of inquiry for substantiating discriminatory conduct requiring redress by the courts. See Def. Mem. of Law; Def. Reply.
Additionally, Defendants argue with respect to Count 2, Plaintiff's claim under Section 504, that because Schine failed to allege explicitly that OPWDD's refusal to grant his application for a waiver was based solely on Schine's disability, that count must be dismissed. See Def. Mem. of Law at 4-5.
As laid out in detail below, the Court disagrees with Defendants' position and respectfully recommends that their motion for a judgment on the pleadings be denied in its entirety.

II. Legal Standard
Defendants motion for a judgment on the pleadings is assessed under standards similar to a motion to dismiss. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint must set out a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ("Fed. R. Civ. Pro.") 8. Rule 12(c) provides that "[a]fter the pleadings are closed—but early enough not to delay trial—a party may move for judgment on the pleadings." Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(c).
Under Rule 12(c), a party is entitled to judgment on the pleadings "only if it has established that no material issue of fact [*10]  remains to be resolved and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Juster Assocs. v. City of Rutland, Vt., 901 F.2d 266, 269 (2d Cir.1990). "'The standard for addressing a Rule 12(c) motion ... is the same as that for a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.'" State of N.Y. v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 160 F. Supp. 3d 629, 637-38 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (quoting Cleveland v. Caplaw Enters., 448 F.3d 518, 521 (2d Cir.2006)); Ziemba v. Wezner, 366 F.3d 161, 163 (2d Cir.2004) (applying same standard as that applicable to motion under Rule 12(b)(6)). However, unlike Rule 12(b), Rule 12(c) permits the court to consider not only the complaint, but also the answer, including affirmative defenses; attached written documents; and "any matter of which the court can take judicial notice for the factual background of the case." Tomassi v. Sheehan, No. 15CV3605, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113431, 2016 WL 4768826, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 23, 2016), report and recommendation adopted, No. 15CV3605, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124223, 2016 WL 4767539 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 13, 2016) (quoting L—7 Designs, Inc. v. Old Navy, LLC, 647 F.3d 419, 422 (2d Cir. 2011)).
To dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(c) a court must be satisfied that the complaint cannot state any set of facts that would entitle a plaintiff to relief. See Florio v. City of N.Y., N.Y., No. 06 CIV. 6473, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55386, 2008 WL 2854116, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2008). In making this determination, however, the Court must assume all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, as motions to dismiss assess the sufficiency of a plaintiff's complaint, not the sufficiency of a plaintiff's evidence. See id.; Miller v. Wolpoff & Abramson, L.L.P., 321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir. 2003). Nevertheless, to survive a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, a complaint must provide more than mere theoretical possibility in its allegations [*11]  and establish the slightly higher standard of plausibility. See Joseph S. v. Hogan, 561 F. Supp. 2d 280, 288 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (applying Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 157-58 (2d Cir.2007)) (holding that a complaint must "amplify a claim with some factual allegations ... to render the claim plausible"); but see, e.g., Hon Hai Precision Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Wi—LAN, Inc., No. 12 Civ. 7900, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74818, 2013 WL 2322675, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. May 28, 2013) (concluding that the Twombly pleading standard does not apply to affirmative defenses, but rather the lower standard of Rule 8(c) governs). As part of this sufficiency inspection, a court must simultaneously examine the complaint for legal feasibility and ensure that there is more put forth than "'bald assertions and conclusions of law.'" See Khan v. City of N.Y., No. 14CV4665, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16558, 2016 WL 1128298, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 2016), report and recommendation adopted, No. 14CV4665, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37080, 2016 WL 1192667 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 2016) (quoting Leeds v. Meltz, 85 F.3d 51, 53 (2d Cir. 1996) in the context of Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)).

III. Discussion

A. The Americans with Disabilities and Rehabilitation Acts
Preliminarily, the Court considers Plaintiff's claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act together. Though there are minor differences between the two statutes, courts regularly analyze claims under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act identically and simultaneously. See, e.g., Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F.3d 611, 618 (2d Cir. 1999) ("Because Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA impose identical requirements, we consider these claims in tandem.")). Nevertheless, the Court is cognizant that the statutes are not identical, but "nearly identical." McElwee v. Cnty. of Orange, 700 F.3d 635, 640 (2d Cir.2012). First, although [*12]  a violation of Section 504, requires an additional showing that the defendant has received federal funding, see Henrietta D., 331 F.3d at 272, as set forth herein, Plaintiff alleges and Defendants do not dispute this factor, rendering the Rehabilitation Act otherwise applicable. See Compl. DE [1], Answer DE [10]. Defendants, however, emphasize the second difference between the two statutes, that the reach of the Rehabilitation Act is limited to denials of benefits "solely by reason of ... disability," 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (emphasis added), while the ADA applies more broadly to such denials "by reason of ... disability," 42 U.S.C. § 12132. See Cercpac v. Health & Hosps. Corp., 147 F.3d 165, 167 (2d Cir. 1998). Here, as described above, Plaintiff does not claim that he required and/or was denied a reasonable accommodation for any reason other than his disability. See supra at 2-4. Accordingly, as Plaintiff's claims do not implicate any of the "subtle differences," between the two statutes, they may be analyzed together. Cf. Logan v. Matveevskii, 57 F. Supp. 3d 234, 255 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (finding the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, as well as the Fair Housing Act, did not conflict regarding a disabled tenant's request for the reasonable accommodation of a ground-floor apartment, where tenant alleged the only basis for his request and his landlord's denial was his disability).
To analyze the sufficiency [*13]  of such claims, the Second Circuit employs a three-part test. Id. Plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) he is a "qualified individual" with a disability; (2) that the defendants are subject to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act; and (3) that plaintiff was denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from defendants' services, programs, or activities, or were otherwise discriminated against, by reason of a plaintiff's disabilities. See id. at 272.
The third prong of discriminatory conduct in violation of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act may take the form of a refusal to afford a reasonable accommodation. See Davis v. Shah, 821 F.3d 231, 260 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing Fulton v. Goord, 591 F.3d 37, 43 (2d Cir.2009)) ("A plaintiff may base her discrimination claim on one of three theories of liability: disparate treatment, disparate impact, or failure to make a reasonable accommodation."). The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act "require[ ] that covered entities make reasonable accommodations in order to provide qualified individuals with an equal opportunity to receive benefits from or to participate in programs run by such entities." Logan v. Matveevskii, 57 F. Supp. 3d 234, 253-54 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (quoting Reg'l Econ. Cmty. Action Program, Inc. v. City of Middletown, 294 F.3d 35, 45 (2d Cir.2002), superseded by statute on other grounds, ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub.L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553,, as recognized in McCulloch v. Town of Milan, 559 Fed. Appx. 96, 98 (2d Cir.2014)). Analysis of a reasonable accommodation claim under both statutes is treated the same. See [*14]  Sinisgallo v. Town of Islip Hous. Auth., 865 F. Supp. 2d 307, 337 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (citations, and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Vinson v. Thomas, 288 F.3d 1145, 1152 n. 7 (9th Cir. 2002) ("[T]here is no significant difference in the analysis of rights and obligations created by the [ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act]."). Determining whether a plaintiff's request may be recognized to be a "reasonable" accommodation requires "a fact-specific, case-by-case inquiry, not only into the benefits of the accommodation but into its costs as well." Fulton v. Goord, 591 F.3d 37, 44 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Staron v. McDonald's Corp., 51 F.3d 353, 356 (2d Cir.1995); Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 138 (2d Cir.1995).
The Complaint clearly alleges and Defendants do not substantively dispute that Plaintiff is a qualified individual due to his developmental and mental-health-related disabilities and that Defendants are subject to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act by virtue of being a state entity participating in federal funding. See Comp. at ¶¶ 20-36, 78, 84; Def. Mem. at 1-3. The entirety of Defendants' motion is focused on the third element, whereby they contend that their conduct, as a matter of law, cannot be classified as discriminatory and therefore violative of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. See Def. Mem. of Law; Def. Reply.
Nevertheless, as laid out in detail below, the Court concludes that Plaintiff sufficiently alleges this third element in addition to the first two. Schine's [*15]  particularized claims that Defendants' refusal to grant his application for a waiver effectively denied Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation and, due specifically to the contours of his developmental and mental disabilities, meaningful access to state-sponsored services and benefits. That this has additionally put Schine in imminent danger of being institutionalized properly articulates plausible claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Accordingly, the Court respectfully recommends that Defendants' motion be denied with respect to both Counts 1 and 2.

B. The Integration Mandate
Under Counts 1 and 2, Plaintiff brought suit under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act alleging discrimination specifically under a theory that Defendant's conduct violated the "integration mandates" issued by the United States Attorney General. See Compl. At ¶¶ 80, 85. Under the ADA, the Attorney General has the responsibility to promulgate implementing regulations. See 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a); 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). By virtue of this authority, the "integration mandate" was issued for the purpose of combatting the improper marginalization of those with mental illness through undue segregation and isolation. See id. The mandate requires public entities, [*16]  such as Defendants, to "administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities." See id. A failure to provide "placement 'in a setting that enables disabled individuals to interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible'" violates the ADA's integration mandate. Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1479, 1999 WL 20910, at *9 (D. Conn. Jan.5, 1999) (quoting 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. A at 450). Accordingly, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie violation of 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) by proving that a defendant placed certain residents in a more restrictive setting than required. See 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1479, [WL] at *10.
Here, in defending the propriety of his claim, Plaintiff relies primarily on Olmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999). See Pl. Mem. of Law at 10-16. Olmstead first considered the scope of the integration mandate and determined, "with a qualified yes," that "the proscription of discrimination may require placement of persons with mental disabilities in community settings rather than in institutions," in part, because "[u]njustified isolation ... is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability." Id. at 597, 600. Contrary to Defendant's position, in light of this overriding concern for preventing the unnecessary segregation of disabled individuals, "no demonstration of differential treatment [*17]  between individuals with mental illness and those without is required." Hogan, 561 F. Supp. 2d at 290 (citing Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 335 (3d Cir. 1995) (holding that evidence of discriminatory animus is not required to establish an ADA or Section 504 claim); see Messier, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1479, 1999 WL 20910, at *9 (The ADA "prohibits states from providing services to individuals with disabilities in an unnecessarily segregated setting, even absent a showing of differential treatment between disabled and nondisabled persons.").
Though the Court acknowledges that the factual context of Olmstead is distinguishable from the present matter, it remains applicable here and allows Plaintiff to survive Defendants' Rule 12(c) motion. The Olmstead plaintiffs were psychiatric patients already institutionalized in a state hospital despite the medical determination that their individual needs could have been met in community-based settings. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607. Accordingly, the Supreme Court concluded that Title II of the ADA required states to provide community-based treatment for persons with mental disabilities taking into account three factors that were present in that case: (1) the state's professionals determined that such placements were suitable, (2) the disabled individuals did not oppose placement in the community, and (3) the less restrictive placements [*18]  could be reasonably accommodated given the resources available to the state and the needs of others with mental disabilities. Id. at 608.
Olmstead does not require, however, that a medical professional endorse Plaintiff's request for relief at the pleadings stage, if ever. See Hogan, 561 F. Supp. 2d at 289-93. Moreover, it does not it limit the applicability of the integration mandate only to those presently institutionalized. Davis v. Shah, 821 F.3d 231, 263 (2d Cir. 2016) (holding that a plaintiff may state a valid claim for disability discrimination by demonstrating that the defendant's actions create a serious risk of institutionalization for disabled persons). Therefore, Plaintiff's complaint may survive a motion for judgment on the pleadings if it lays out, with sufficient factual detail, allegations that Defendants' rejection of Schine's petition for a waiver amounted to a refusal to reasonably accommodate his disability with respect to the administration and provision of his services which in turn placed him at an increased risk of institutionalization.
As already laid out above, the Complaint alleges in substantial detail that Schine's current unstable placement in his state-subsidized, studio apartment has plausibly led to a deterioration in his mental health that [*19]  is increasing his isolation and interfering with his receiving effective support services. See supra at 2-4. Eventually, this deterioration will likely require Schine's institutionalization. Id. Plaintiff has also alleged that granting Schine's request is a cost-effective solution that simultaneously helps prevent his institutionalization while allowing him to meaningfully access the services he is already entitled to in a much more integrated environment. See supra at 4. Thus, Plaintiff has alleged with sufficient factual detail that Defendants failed to "administer [their] services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities." 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); cf. Cramer v. Chiles, 33 F.Supp.2d 1342, 1353 (S.D.Fla.1999) ("Institutionalization of individuals with developmental disabilities, against their will, where less confining programs will satisfy their needs, violates the Americans with Disabilities Act's integration requirements."). Accordingly, the Court recommends that Defendant's motion for a judgment on the pleadings be denied with respect to Counts 1 and 2 and that Plaintiff's case be allowed to go forward. Cf. ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007) ("Once a claim has been adequately stated, it may be supported by showing any set of facts [*20]  consistent with the allegations in the complaint.").

C. Fundamental Alteration Defense
Though Defendants argue that the broad relief that Plaintiff seeks would require a fundamental alteration to New York State's mental health policies and practices, dismissal is nevertheless inappropriate at this stage of the litigation because the assertion of this affirmative defense does not negate the basic plausibility and validity of the pleadings at issue. Cf. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 604-06. Though likely germane in a motion for summary judgment, Defendants' allusions to the impracticality of Plaintiff's requested relief — invoking regulatory and reimbursement concerns — is premature and inapplicable in a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Compare Def. Mem. of Law at 6-7 with Martin v. Taft, 222 F. Supp. 2d 940, 972 (S.D. Ohio 2002) (cited by Disability Advocates, Inc. v. Paterson, 598 F. Supp. 2d 289, 335 (E.D.N.Y. 2009)) ("[W]hether [the] requested relief would entail a fundamental alteration is a question that cannot be answered in the context of a motion to dismiss."). To prevail, Defendants bear the burden of establishing that a "fundamental alteration" is required to grant the relief sought by Plaintiff, only after Plaintiff has established by a preponderance of evidence the appropriateness of his claim. See id. (noting that the state bore the burden of establishing [*21]  that community based treatment was not feasible and required a fundamental alteration only after accepting that plaintiffs had established the validity of their claims). Accordingly, the intensive cost-benefit analysis that would be necessary to assess a fundamental alteration defense is not appropriately made at the pleading stage. See Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004) (holding that whether requiring defendant state to fully fund at-home, private-duty nursing for plaintiff would be unreasonable, or would require a fundamental alteration of the state's programs and services, could not be resolved on motion for judgment on the pleadings).
Even were the court to consider the proffered affirmative defense at this point and time, based on the submissions before it, the Court would not alter its determination that Defendants' 12(c) motion should be denied. In Radaszewski, though the Circuit Court ultimately reversed the district court's granting of the defendant's motion on the pleadings and remanded the matter, it did note, "If the state would have to pay a private facility to care for [Plaintiff] ... and the cost of that placement equaled or exceeded the cost of caring for him at home, then it would be difficult to see [*22]  how requiring the State to pay for at-home care would amount to an unreasonable, fundamental alteration of its programs and services." Id. at 614-15. An analogous situation, though one with the comparable costs reversed, is present here with Plaintiff substantiating and Defendants not disputing that the overall costs could likely be lower were Schine to receive his services through Atria rather than continue with his current HCBS program. Compare id. with supra at 2-4. Under such circumstances, the State has not demonstrated that Plaintiff's requested relief would require an unreasonable, fundamental alteration to its programs and services, rendering the affirmative defense unsubstantiated and dismissal inapplicable.
Accordingly, the Court respectfully recommends that Defendants' motion again be denied.

D. New Substantive Rights or Benefits
In their Reply Memorandum of Law, Defendants argue that placement of Plaintiff in Atria pursuant to Olmstead is in conflict with Second Circuit precedent in that it would constitute the impermissible granting of new substantive rights. See Def. Reply at 2-4. In support of this contention, Defendant's rely on Leocata ex rel. Gilbride v. Wilson-Coker, 343 F. Supp. 2d 144 (D. Conn. 2004), aff'd sub nom. Leocata v. Leavitt, 148 F. App'x 64 (2d Cir. 2005). In that case, the plaintiff was an elderly woman [*23]  suffering from advanced dementia who had been residing in an assisted living facility at her own expense. Id. at 146-47. However, once the costs threatened to exhaust her personal assets, she sought to force the State of Connecticut to fund her continued care by bringing an action under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. Id. At that time, despite the fact that the cost of care was much higher, the Medicaid program under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., only allowed benefits to be paid to a skilled nursing care facility with no provision for assisted living homes. Id. In addition to various other constitutional claims, the plaintiff alleged that the failure of the state defendants to fund her care in the manner she was proposing violated her rights under Title II of the ADA. Id. In support of her ADA claim, the plaintiff relied upon Olmstead to argue for the "general rule" that "the ADA requires disabled Medicaid recipients to be provided care in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs." Id.
The Court does not rely on such a broad interpretation of Olmstead in arriving at its recommendation that Defendants' Rule 12(c) motion be denied. The Leocata court and the present Defendants are correct [*24]  that the Second Circuit's controlling interpretation of Olmstead is more narrowly tailored than the plaintiff in Leocata proposed. See id.; Def. Reply at 3-4. The Second Circuit pointed out that in Olmstead, Georgia was not being required to fund new community-based treatment, but instead simply to place the Olmstead plaintiffs in pre-existing non-institutional treatment programs. Id. In support of its determination, Leocata cited to Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F.3d 611 (2d Cir. 1999), specifically its conclusion that "the ADA does not mandate the provision of new benefits." Id. at 619 (holding that because defendant city does not provide "task" safety monitoring as a benefit for any covered individuals, it did not violate the ADA to not provide this new benefit to appellees regardless of whether it may have been beneficial to them and would allow them to avoid institutionalization). According to Rodriguez, "Olmstead does not ... stand for the proposition that states must provide disabled individuals with the opportunity to remain out of institutions," but "only that 'States must adhere to the ADA's nondiscrimination requirement with regard to the services they in fact provide.'" Id. at 619 (quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 n. 14).
What distinguishes the plaintiff in Leocata from Schine [*25]  is that she was essentially requesting that Connecticut be ordered to create a new program that would allow her to determine her living situation outside of the institutionalized setting of a skilled nursing facility — an option that did not then exist. Compare Leocata at 156 with Compl. at ¶¶ 24-25, 52-56. In contrast, here, New York State through OPWDD already has established such a program funding the treatment and subsidizing the living expenses of Plaintiff and other similarly situated individuals through the HCBS's PRA-SD Budgets which seek to personalize each covered individual's service program so as to allow them to live in the community with coordinated support. See Compl. at ¶¶ 24-25, 52-56; Def. Mem. of Law at 2; Pl. Mem. of Law at 2-4. Unlike in Leocata, Plaintiff alleges, and Defendants do not dispute, that the housing funds already allocated to Schine could be utilized to pay a portion of Atria's total costs. See Compl. ¶¶ 54-58. Moreover, Plaintiff's request is not that he be given additional services or an increase in the housing subsidy. See id. Instead, the Complaint simply seeks to allow Plaintiff to choose to have the same services, which are already funded and classified as [*26]  "self-directed," be provided through Atria rather than through personally hired caregivers working in his studio apartment — a situation alleged in the Complaint to provide no meaningful access to these services. See id.; supra at 2-4. Because Plaintiff's challenge is not with respect to the services that Schine is actually due, but merely the failure of those benefits to be administered in a manner that reasonably accommodates his disabilities' particularized challenges, placing him unnecessarily at a significantly higher risk of institutionalization, Plaintiff has put forth a cognizable claim under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.

E. Specified Discrimination Animus
Finally, and contrary to Defendant's assertions, this application of Olmstead as not requiring Plaintiff to plead that Defendants acted with animus solely or predominantly based upon Plaintiff's disability is in keeping with Second Circuit precedent. In Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, city residents afflicted with AIDS or other HIV-related illnesses brought a class action lawsuit against the city for violating the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and various other federal, state, and city laws. Henrietta, 331 F.3d at 269-71. There the established municipal program to provide [*27]  meaningful access for plaintiffs to public assistance programs, benefits, and services that were otherwise due plaintiffs systematically failed because of the unique limitations stemming from plaintiffs' compromised immune systems. Id.
In finding for the plaintiffs, the Second Circuit first held that, in advancing a reasonable accommodation claim under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff need not also show that the challenged program or practice has a disparate impact on persons with disabilities, clarifying that there is no requirement to show that a "comparison class" exists in putting forth an ADA action seeking a reasonable accommodation. Id. at 291. Additionally, the Henrietta court found that such a plaintiff may show that he or she has been excluded from or denied the benefits of a public entity's services or programs "by reason of such disability" as long as the disability was a substantial cause of the exclusion or denial despite the presence of other contributory causes. Id. So, although a valid claim under Title II of the ADA requires that "there must be something different about the way the plaintiff is treated 'by reason of ... disability,'" this disparate treatment requirement [*28]  can be established either by showing acts of discrimination or, more simply as in the case presently before the Court, "the demonstration that a disability makes it difficult for a plaintiff to access benefits that are available to both those with and without [his] disabilities." Id. at 276-77 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12132).
In emphasizing the unique considerations present in a reasonable accommodation case, the Second Circuit noted that a defendant's assertion that denying a request for an accommodation only leaves a disabled plaintiff as unable to access benefits as all others similarly situated does not establish that the accommodation sought was unreasonable nor does it prove that such a plaintiff is receiving the basic "meaningful access" guaranteed under the law. Id at 273 (citing Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-02, 105 S.Ct. 712, 83 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1985)). This final line of inquiry, the Circuit maintained, should be the focus of the proper analysis of a claim under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. See id.
Applying these standards, Schine is clearly alleging that due to the contours of his disability he is not receiving meaningful access to his benefits as would other disabled individuals without his specific set of limitations. See supra 2-4. OPWDD's arbitrary categorization of all costs associated with [*29]  Atria as living expenses is, according to Schine, forcing Plaintiff's continued housing in his studio apartment, which impedes him from effectively receiving all other forms of support services presently due him under the law. Id. The Complaint states a cause of action and Defendants' motion should be denied because nowhere in the Complaint does Plaintiff demand fundamentally novel services or programming or new substantive rights. Instead, in hopes of decreasing his risk of institutionalization, Schine requests that his disabilities be reasonably accommodated, so as to permit him meaningfully to receive the state-guaranteed support and treatment due any community-placed disabled New York State resident.

IV. Conclusion
Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the Court respectfully recommends that Defendants' motion for a judgment on the pleadings be denied in its entirety.
