Opinion



ORDER
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant's Daubert Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Written Opinions of Plaintiff's Expert, Philip A Levin, M.D. ("Daubert Motion," Doc. 73) and Defendant's Motion for Final Summary Judgment (Doc. 76). For the reasons set forth below, the Motion for Final Summary Judgment will be granted and the Daubert Motion will be denied as moot.

I. Background
Plaintiff is a former flight attendant for Defendant. (Camacho Aff., Doc. 77, at 8). During his employment, on January 4, 2020, Plaintiff was on an overnight layover between working flights, [*2]  so Defendant provided him a hotel room with one of its business partners. (Id. at 9). Plaintiff spent that afternoon at different bars. (Pl. Dep., Doc. 74-1, at 24). When Plaintiff returned to the hotel in the evening, he was in a "dream-like state," (id.), and "stumble[d] into [the] lobby" exhibiting signs typical of inebriation, including incoherent speech, disorientation, and agitation, (Guest Incident Report, Doc. 77-13, at 2-3). These signs can also occur if someone is experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis. (Doc. 74-1 at 31). Once seated in the restaurant at the hotel, Plaintiff "pound[ed] on the table," "yell[ed] at the TV," scared away patrons, and became "very aggressive" with hotel staff. (Doc. 77-13 at 2-3). Plaintiff refused to resign to his room when asked, so the staff contacted the police in fear of their safety. (Id.). "Officers brought [Plaintiff] to his room" to collect his property but he "refused to pack," (Buffalo PD Police Report, Doc. 77-12, at 2), ensuing in a "loud argument" that woke up hotel guests, (Buffalo Layover 1/4/2020 Email, Doc. 77-11, at 2-3). Plaintiff was arrested for criminal trespass and spent the night in custody. (Doc. 77-12 at 2). Neither his [*3]  blood sugar nor alcohol content were tested during this episode. (Doc. 74-1 at 25).
The hotel reported the incident to Defendant on January 5, 2020, (Hyatt Regency Buffalo Email, Doc. 77-9, at 2), which triggered an internal investigation and a temporary removal of Plaintiff from flight operations, (Doc. 77 at 10). On that same day, Plaintiff informed Defendant for the first time that he has diabetes. (Diabetic Incident at the Buffalo Hyatt Regency Email, Doc. 77-10, at 2). On January 8, 2020, Plaintiff's supervisors met with him to discuss the incident. (Doc. 77 at 12-13). Defendant allowed Plaintiff to continue working part-time pending conclusion of its investigation. (Doc. 77 at 19).
As part of the investigation, Defendant requested proof of Plaintiff's diabetes diagnosis, and once supplied, Defendant then requested a doctor's note substantiating that his conduct "on the date of the incident was a result of [his] medical condition." (Type II Diabetes Diagnosis Email Chain, Doc. 77-15, at 2). On February 25, 2020, Plaintiff provided a doctor's note which stated that Plaintiff's "diabetes and high blood sugar could possibly have explained his condition on 1/4/20." (Doctor's Note, Doc. [*4]  77-16, at 3). On March 16, 2020, Defendant terminated Plaintiff for "violation of company policy." (Termination Letter, Doc. 77-22, at 2).
On March 20, 2020, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), and on April 6, 2021, Plaintiff was issued a Notice of Right to Sue. (Doc. 28-1 at 1). Plaintiff filed this action, bringing the following claims, inter alia:1 disparate treatment under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12111 et seq., (Count I); disparate treatment based on disability under the Florida Civil Rights Act ("FCRA"), Fla. Stat. § 760.01 et seq., (Count II); failure to accommodate under the ADA (Count III); and failure to accommodate under the FCRA (Count IV). (Am. Compl., Doc. 28, at 8-13). Defendant moves for summary judgment on all counts. (See generally Doc. 76). Defendant also moves to exclude Plaintiff's expert evidence. (See generally Doc. 73)

II. Daubert Motion
Defendant seeks to exclude opinions of Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Philip Levin. (Doc. 73). But as discussed below, even considering Dr. Levin's opinions and assuming arguendo that they are admissible, Defendant is still entitled to summary judgment on all claims. Therefore, the Court need not address the Daubert Motion, and it will be denied as moot. [*5] 

III. Motion for Summary Judgment

A. Legal Standard
"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A fact is material if it may "affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Id.
"The moving party bears the initial burden of showing the court, by reference to materials on file, that there are no genuine issues of material fact that should be decided at trial." Allen v. Bd. of Pub. Educ., 495 F.3d 1306, 1313-14 (11th Cir. 2007). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court construes the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). However, when faced with a "properly supported motion for summary judgment," the nonmoving party "must come forward with specific factual evidence, presenting more than mere allegations." Gargiulo v. G.M. Sales, Inc., 131 F.3d 995, 999 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248-49 (1986)); see also LaRoche v. Denny's, Inc., 62 F. Supp. 2d 1366, 1371 (S.D. Fla. 1999) ("The law is clear . . . that suspicion, perception, opinion, and belief cannot be used to defeat a motion for summary judgment.").
"[A]t the summary judgment stage the judge's function is not himself [*6]  to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. "[T]he proper inquiry on summary judgment is 'whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.'" Stitzel v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 361 F. App'x 20, 22 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52). Put another way, a motion for summary judgment should be denied only "[i]f reasonable minds could differ on the inferences arising from undisputed [material] facts." Pioch v. IBEX Eng'g Servs., 825 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Allen v. Tyson Foods Inc., 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997).

B. Analysis
"Because Florida courts construe the FCRA in conformity with the ADA, [an FCRA] disability discrimination cause of action is analyzed under the ADA." Wimberly v. Sec. Tech. Group, Inc., 866 So. 2d 146, 147 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004). Hence, all of Plaintiff's claims will be analyzed under the ADA, which "prohibits discrimination by an employer 'against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability' in any of the 'terms, conditions, [or] privileges of employment.'" Mazzeo v. Color Resols. Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)).
When a disability discrimination claim is based on circumstantial evidence, as is the case here, the Eleventh Circuit dictates that the three-part McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework applies. Todd v. Fayette Cnty. Sch. Dist., 998 F.3d 1203, 1215 (11th Cir. 2021) (ADA); Ray v. City of Tallahassee, 664 F. App'x 816, 818 (11th Cir. 2016) (FCRA). Under this framework, the plaintiff has the initial burden [*7]  to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). "Demonstrating a prima facie case is not onerous; it requires only that the plaintiff establish facts adequate to permit an inference of discrimination." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence, a presumption of discrimination arises. See Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253-54, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).
Once the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case and its attendant presumption arises, the burden "shift[s] to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for its actions. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If the employer meets this burden, "the presumption of discrimination is eliminated and the plaintiff has the opportunity to come forward with evidence . . . sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision." Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000) (quotation omitted). "An employer's stated reason is not a pretext unless it is shown that both: (1) the reason was false; and (2) the real reason was unlawful." Vega v. Invsco Grp., Ltd., 432 F. App'x 867, 871 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)). "If the plaintiff does not proffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether each of the defendant employer's articulated reasons [*8]  is pretextual, the employer is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's claim." Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1024-25.
However, "establishing the elements of the McDonnell Douglas framework is not . . . the sine qua non for a plaintiff to survive a summary judgment motion in an employment discrimination case." Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011). If, despite failing to precisely establish the McDonnell Douglas elements, the plaintiff "presents circumstantial evidence that creates a triable issue concerning the employer's discriminatory intent"—i.e., "a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the decisionmaker"—the plaintiff can still survive summary judgment. Id. (quotation and footnote omitted).

1. Counts I & II — Disparate Treatment
"To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that, at the time of the adverse employment action, he had a disability, he was a qualified individual, and he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability." Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268 (citing Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007)). Seemingly conceding all elements besides the last, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment because he cannot show that his termination was because [*9]  of his diabetes. (Doc. 76 at 18). The Court disagrees. The evidence shows that Plaintiff was terminated explicitly based upon an incident involving his disability, (see Crew Relations Separation Review, Doc. 77-19, at 2-3), which is sufficient to raise an inference of discrimination under this light standard. Thus, Plaintiff has established a prima facie case for disparate treatment.
Next, Defendant argues that the presumption of discrimination is eliminated by its legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff—the incident on January 4, 2020, which Defendant found violated its policy on performance expectations. (Doc. 76 at 19-20; see e-Guidance and Performance Expectations, Doc. 77-4, at 2-5). This explanation is bolstered by a paper trail of internal documents that discuss Plaintiff's "[a]busive or inconsiderate treatment" of Defendant's business partner and "[c]onduct detrimental to [Defendant's] best interests." (Doc. 77-19 at 2-3; see Summary of Trigger Event, Doc. 77-18, at 2; Crewmember Progressive Guidance Report, Doc. 77-17, at 3-4). Thus, Defendant's explanation is sufficient to shift the burden back to Plaintiff, who must show pretext with "concrete evidence [*10]  in the form of specific facts," Bryant v. Jones, 575 F.3d 1281, 1308 (11th Cir. 2009), in order for his disparate treatment claims to survive summary judgment. Plaintiff's burden is met if he can "produce additional evidence suggesting discrimination after contradicting [his] employer's stated reasons." Flowers v. Troup Cnty., Ga., Sch. Dist., 803 F.3d 1327, 1339 (11th Cir. 2015).
Plaintiff identifies the following as evidence of pretext: that Plaintiff was terminated two months after disclosing his disability; that the termination was based on an incident involving his disability; that Plaintiff was assured job security if he provided proof of his disability; that Plaintiff was permitted to work part-time during the pendency of the investigation; that Defendant delayed in making its termination decision; that Defendant failed to comply with its own internal policies; and that Defendant conducted a lackluster investigation. (Pl.'s Response, Doc. 87, at 15-19). Plaintiff contends that, taken together, he has offered sufficient evidence of pretext to allow a reasonable jury to infer that Defendant's termination of Plaintiff was disability discrimination. This Court disagrees. Even accepting this evidence as true and construing it in Plaintiff's favor, it indicates nothing more than a haphazardly handled investigation [*11]  and separation.
First, Plaintiff does not offer any evidence that Defendant's explanation for his termination is false. There is no genuine dispute that Plaintiff was fired because of his conduct on January 4, 2020. Second, assuming arguendo that Plaintiff could meet the first element of pretext, he also provides no evidence that there is a different, unlawful reason for his termination. None of the evidence proffered by Plaintiff show "that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer." Jackson v. State of Ala. State Tenure Comm'n, 405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir. 2005). Even if Defendant bungled the investigation and separation, that alone does not demonstrate disability discrimination or discredit Defendant's valid basis for terminating Plaintiff.
The Eleventh Circuit has "repeatedly and emphatically held that a defendant may terminate an employee for a good or bad reason without violating federal law." Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets Of Fla., Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir. 1999). Regardless of if Plaintiff's behavior during the January 4 incident can be attributed to his diabetes, as Plaintiff's expert opines, (Dr. Levin Report, Doc. 73-1, at 3), "[t]he majority position . . . holds that an employer may discipline or terminate an employee for workplace misconduct even when the misconduct is a result of the disability." Caporicci v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 189 F. Supp. 3d 1314, 1323 (M.D. Fla. 2016), aff'd [*12] , 729 F. App'x 812 (11th Cir. 2018); see also Martinson v. Kinney Shoe Corp., 104 F.3d 683, 686 n.3 (4th Cir. 1997) ("[M]isconduct-even misconduct related to a disability-is not itself a disability, and an employer is free to fire an employee on that basis.").
Plaintiff's behavior towards his employer's business partner and his arrest for criminal trespass at a hotel provided by his employer certainly amounts to misconduct. And Plaintiff admitted he was at fault for irresponsibly managing his blood sugar. (Doc. 77-10 at 3). Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to present evidence of pretext and Defendant is due summary judgment on Counts I and II.

2. Counts III & IV — Reasonable Accommodation 2
"To state a prima facie claim for failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) he was discriminated against by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." McKane v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., 363 F. App'x 679, 681 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). "The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job's essential functions." Id. (citing Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56).
Plaintiff argues that on January 8, 2022, Defendant "accommodate[d] him and conditioned the continuation of that accommodation only on the receipt of his diabetes [*13]  diagnosis," but then "withdrew its original accommodation of [Plaintiff's] disability without making a determination . . . as to whether his disability had caused the January 4 incident." (Doc. 87 at 13-14). Plaintiff characterizes the permission he received to continue working part-time during the pendency of the investigation as an accommodation for his diabetes. Plaintiff was apparently under the impression that the investigation only hinged on him proving his disability. Thus, Plaintiff argues that when he was terminated at the conclusion of the investigation, he was denied a reasonable accommodation.
A reasonable accommodation is one that "enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255 (citing LaChance v. Duffy's Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1998)). The ADA defines the term as "making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities," and including, but not limited to "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, [and] the provision of qualified readers or interpreters." [*14]  42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). The EEOC regulations further clarify that reasonable accommodations are "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii).
The evidence shows that Plaintiff never requested an accommodation for his disability; that no aspect of his job was modified or adjusted after January 8, 2022, to reflect Plaintiff's newly disclosed disability; and that Defendant has a common practice of permitting employees, disabled or not, to work during investigations. (See Doc. 77 at 19). Additionally, none of the opinions cited by Plaintiff support his stance that being excused of disability-related misconduct constitutes a reasonable accommodation. (See Doc. 87 at 12). The ADA does not grant disabled employees carte blanche by requiring employers to excuse their misconduct. See J.A.M. v. Nova Se. Univ., Inc., 646 F. App'x 921, 926 (11th Cir. 2016) ("[Defendant] is not required to excuse past misconduct, even if that misconduct is linked to [someone's] . . . disability."); Howard v. Steris Corp., 886 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1295 (M.D. Ala. 2012), aff'd, 550 F. App'x 748 (11th Cir. 2013) ("[E]ven if hindsight later reveals the employee's disability caused the misconduct, the employer has no duty to go back and retroactively excuse the misconduct."). Therefore, Plaintiff [*15]  was never denied a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate and Defendant is due summary judgment on Counts III and IV.

IV. Conclusion
In accordance with the foregoing, it is ORDERED and ADJUDGED as follows:
1. Defendant's Motion for Final Summary Judgment (Doc. 76) is GRANTED.
2. Defendant's Daubert Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Written Opinions of Plaintiff's Expert, Philip A Levin, M.D. (Doc. 73) is DENIED as moot.
3. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff, providing that Plaintiff shall take nothing on his claims.
4. Thereafter, the Clerk is directed to close this case.
DONE and ORDERED in Orlando, Florida on June 26, 2023.
