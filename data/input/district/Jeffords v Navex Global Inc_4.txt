FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION

UNDER SEAL1
BECKERMAN, U.S. Magistrate Judge.
Plaintiff Valerie Jeffords ("Jeffords") filed this case against NAVEX Global, Inc. ("NAVEX"), asserting claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), and the Equal Pay Act ("EPA"). (ECF No. 1.) Now before the Court is Jeffords's motion for partial summary judgment (ECF No. 34) and NAVEX's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 36).
The Court has jurisdiction over Jeffords's claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, but not all parties have consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636. The Court heard oral argument on the motions on December 20, 2022. (ECF No. 63.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court recommends that the district judge deny Jeffords' s motion for partial summary judgment and grant NAVEX's motion for [*2]  summary judgment.

BACKGROUND2
In September 2008, Steve Chapman ("Chapman") hired Jeffords as a Solutions Consultant at NAVEX.3 (See Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. ("Pl.'s Mot.") Ex. 1, Depo. Valerie Jeffords ("Jeffords Depo.") at 13:5-12; Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 2, Depo. Steve Chapman 30(b)(6) Designee ("Chapman 30(b)(6) Depo.") at 14:5-10.) NAVEX promoted Jeffords to Senior Project Manager in 2009, Director of Professional Services in 2009 or 2010, Director of Engagement Services in 2011, and Vice President of Delivery Services in 2012. (See id. at 15-18, 20:4-11.)
In 2013, Jeffords inadvertently received an Excel spreadsheet containing salary information for NAVEX employees. (See id. at 45:8-16.) Jeffords believed the spreadsheet showed pay discrepancies between herself and male colleagues. (See id. at 45:17-46:5.) According to Jeffords, she informed Chapman of her concerns. (See id. at 45:25-46:5.) Jeffords claims Chapman denied there was a problem with unequal pay. (See Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 10, Sec. Depo. Valerie Jeffords ("Jeffords Depo. II") at 258:21-259:1.) Chapman, however, testified that Jeffords informed him only that she had received the salary information and that he recommended she delete it immediately. [*3]  (See Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 9, Depo. Steve Chapman ("Chapman Depo.") at 54:18-54:21.) Chapman does not recall Jeffords bringing her concern that NAVEX paid her less than men to his attention at that time. (See id. at 55:1-6.)
In 2018, NAVEX promoted Jeffords to Vice President of Global Services. (See Jeffords Depo. at 38:4-6.) On December 30, 2018, Jeffords was in a car accident unrelated to her work for NAVEX, causing injury. (See id. at 103:21-24.) Throughout 2019, Chapman allowed Jeffords to take time off from work for medical treatment and to work from home when experiencing accident-related complications. (See Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 6, Depo. Cindy Raz 30(b)(6) Designee ("Raz 30(b)(6)Depo.") at 60:10-15, 88:18-24; Chapman Depo. at 14:21-15:15.)
NAVEX promoted Jeffords to Senior Vice President, Customer Success, Global Services in September or October 2019. (See Chapman 30(b)(6) Depo. at 49:7-12.) In December 2019, Chapman heard that Jeffords was having issues keeping up with work. (See Chapman Depo. at 26:25-27:6.) Chapman recommended to Jeffords that she meet with Cindy Raz ("Raz"), Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Organizational Development, to discuss taking FMLA leave. (See id.) [*4]  Jeffords met with Raz and it was decided that continuous leave would allow Jeffords to receive necessary medical treatment. (See id. at 27:6-18.) Deborah Tarravechia ("Tarravechia"), then a Senior Human Resources Services Administrator, provided Jeffords with FMLA paperwork at Raz's request and helped process Jeffords's leave, which NAVEX approved. (See Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 8, Depo. Deborah Tarravechia ("Tarravechia Depo.") at 15:11-15, 16:19-20, 19-25, 90:10-14; Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. ("Def.'s Mot.") at 291, NAVEX000648, ECF No. 36.4 )
Jeffords's FMLA leave began on December 23, 2019, with an expected return on January 20, 2020. (Id. at 16:21-23; Raz 30(b)(6) Depo. at 90:3-6; Pl.'s Sealed Exs. ("Pl.'s Exs.") at 11, Jeffords0000019, ECF No. 35.5 ) Prior to returning, Jeffords reached out to Tarravechia and requested additional leave. (See Tarravechia Depo. at 17:1-6.) NAVEX extended Jeffords's leave to the full twelve weeks of protected leave available to Jeffords under FMLA. (See id. at 19:17 22, 30:21-23.) Jeffords's leave was protected under FMLA until March 16, 2020. (See id. at 72:7-9.)
On January 27, 2020, Jeffords's insurance provider approved her for short-term disability ("STD") benefits. [*5]  (See Def.'s Mot. at 300, Jeffords0003063.) To receive STD benefits, Jeffords's insurance provider required her to submit a Medical Request Form ("STD Form"), completed by Jeffords's healthcare provider ("HCP"), to confirm her eligibility. (See id.)
Unrelated to Jeffords's STD benefits, on February 28, 2020, Jeffords's HCP, Dr. McNally, completed a FMLA Certification, demonstrating that Jeffords was unable to perform any of her job duties and would remain incapacitated until "tbd." (Pl.'s Exs. at 15, Jeffords0000167.)
On March 9, 2020, Jeffords sent NAVEX an STD Form completed by a different HCP, Dr. Zielinski, informing Jeffords's insurance provider that she was "[n]ot released for work" and was unable to return to work even if NAVEX provided accommodations because Jeffords's job "require [d] a heavy cognitive load that [] she [wa]s unable to manage [,]" but that she could return to work with restrictions in three months and without restrictions in six months. (See Def.'s Mot. at 325, NAVEX001078.)
On March 16, 2020, Chapman and Raz called Jeffords to inquire how she was doing. (See Jeffords Depo at 176:1-6; see also Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 13, Call Tr. ("Call Tr.").) In Jeffords's own words, [*6]  she was still suffering from "dizziness" and "tinnitus[,]" "it's been kind of like" "walk[ing] around wondering what am I doing [and] 15 minutes later, you remember you're trying to brush your teeth" and "in this week or the next" she would know "where I stand in terms of being able to try to do things like go to the grocery store by myself" but she wanted to "get past this place where bright sun doesn't make me feel nauseous and being able to walk straight without holding the wall." (Call Tr. at 4:4-6, 4:17-5:1, 5:7-10, 12-14.)
On the call, Chapman and Raz informed Jeffords that NAVEX was terminating her employment. (See id.) Chapman and Raz based the decision to terminate Jeffords on several factors, including the FMLA Certification, STD Form, the NAVEX leave of absence policy, and because the company was entering the "unknown" of the COVID-19 pandemic. (See Raz 30(b)(6) Depo. at 99:6-24; Chapman Depo. at 65:6-11, 73:15-20; Call Tr. at 10:11-15.) Raz and Chapman told Jeffords that they hoped she could return once she was able and that there were no plans to backfill or eliminate her position at that time, but that Jeffords being able to return to her role in the future was not guaranteed. [*7]  (See Call Tr. at 7:10-11, 8:17, 9:16-17, 11:7-15.)
After the termination call, Jeffords emailed Raz and Chapman and requested that NAVEX accommodate her by allowing her to maintain employment with NAVEX and either "allow [her] to extend recovery time using a Leave of Absence until [her] doctors approve a ramp back into full time status" or "allow [her] to use a Leave of Absence until doctors approve a full return." (Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 15.) Raz responded to Jeffords and informed her that "regretfully, [a leave of absence] does not afford you any guarantee a position would be available to you once your [HCP] fully releases you back to work." (Def.'s Mot. at 316, NAVEX001146.) NAVEX did not approve Jeffords's requested leave of absence. (See id.)
In May 2020, Jeffords emailed Chapman to provide an update on her progress and inform Chapman that she would be able to return to work in "Mid June."6 (See Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 18.) On May 12, 2020, Chapman responded that he was "unable to bring [her] back until [Raz] receives a formal release from [Jeffords's] doctor." (Id. at 2.) On May 19, Jeffords responded that "[i]t is unfair to only reemploy me if I do not have any restrictions [and] I am perfectly [*8]  capable of performing my job duties with reasonable accommodation." (Id.) Jeffords stated that "to deny me employment simply because I will require reasonable accommodation is discrimination" and "[a]s such, I expect my reemployment to be effective on May 26, 2020." (Id.) Chapman responded that the letter Jeffords provided from her HCP stated she was not released to work, even with restrictions, until June 17, 2020, and informed her that "we cannot hire you back." (Id. at 1.) Chapman also reminded Jeffords that she was "formally no longer an employee with NAVEX at this time" and instructed Jeffords to reach out to Raz with any further communication. (Id.)
Jeffords emailed her concerns to Raz. (See Pl.'s Ex. 19.) Raz informed Jeffords that it "was never the case" that Jeffords would be required to be "100% physically" to return to work. (Id.) Raz reiterated the events surrounding Jeffords's March 16, 2020, termination, and informed Jeffords that despite Jeffords's submission of a new FMLA Certification form dated June 17, 2020, clearing her to return to work with restrictions that same day,7 "reinstatement [was] not available." (Id.; Pl.'s Exs. at 1, Jeffords0000163.)
Jeffords asserts [*9]  that NAVEX (1) violated the ADA by discriminating against Jeffords's disability (Count 1), by failing to engage in the interactive process to accommodate her disability (Count 2), and by retaliating against her for engaging in the protected activity of requesting reasonable accommodation (Count 6); (2) violated FMLA by interfering with her right to reinstatement (Count 3); (3) violated Title VII by discriminating against her based on gender when NAVEX terminated her employment and by not "giving Jeffords comparable base salary pay to male employees" (Count 4); and (4) violated the EPA by setting Jeffords's pay "at a level below her male colleagues" (Count 5). (See generally First Am. Compl. ("FAC"), ECF No. 5.)

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is appropriate if "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). On a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party. See Porter v. Cal. Dep't of Corr., 419 F.3d 885, 891 (9th Cir. 2005). The court does not assess the credibility of witnesses, weigh evidence, or determine the truth of matters in dispute. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "Where [*10]  the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (simplified).

DISCUSSION
Jeffords moves for partial summary judgment on her FMLA reinstatement claim. (See generally Pl.'s Mot.) NAVEX moves for summary judgment on all of Jeffords's claims for several reasons, including, inter alia, that (1) Jeffords had no right to reinstatement after her FMLA leave expired; (2) Jeffords was not a "qualified individual" under the ADA; (3) NAVEX had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason to terminate Jeffords's employment; (4) Jeffords did not request accommodation until after her termination and the accommodation she requested was unreasonable; (5) there is no causal relationship between any protected activity and Jeffords's termination; and (6) Jeffords's wage claims are time-barred. (See generally Def. 's Mot.)

I. FMLA CLAIM
Jeffords moves for partial summary judgment on her FMLA claim.8 She argues that she "had a guaranteed right to reinstatement to her position or an equivalent position at the end of her approved leave" and that "NAVEX interfered with [that] right to reinstatement when it terminated her employment[.]" [*11]  (Id. at 5.)

1. Legal Standards
"Under FMLA, qualifying employees of covered employers gain two substantive rights: (1) the right to take up to twelve weeks of leave for personal medical reasons, to care for a new son or daughter, or to care for family members with serious illnesses; and (2) the right to be restored to the employee's original position, or to a position equivalent in benefits, pay, and conditions of employment, upon return from leave." Stewart v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., No. CV-04-428-HU, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42371, 2005 WL 545359, at *9 (D. Or. Mar. 7, 2005) (citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 2612(a), 2614(a)). "To protect those rights, FMLA makes it 'unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise' any right under the Act." Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1)). "[T]he right to reinstatement is the linchpin of the interference theory since the FMLA does not provide leave for leave's sake, but instead provides leave with an expectation that an employee will return to work after the leave ends." Ambrose v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., No. 3:12-cv-01740-HU, 2014 WL 585376, at *11 (D. Or. Feb. 13, 2014) (simplified).
To establish FMLA interference, "[t]he employee must establish that: (1) she was eligible for FMLA's protections, (2) her employer was covered by the FMLA, (3) she was entitled to leave under the FMLA, (4) she provided sufficient notice of her intent to take leave, and (5) her employer denied [*12]  her FMLA benefits to which she was entitled." Id. (quoting Sanders v. City of Newport, 657 F.3d 772, 778 (9th Cir. 2011) and citing Burnett v. LFW Inc., 472 F.3d 471, 477 (7th Cir. 2006)). "In addition, the plaintiff must show prejudice as a result of the FMLA violation." Santrizos v. Evergreen Fed. Say. & Loan Ass'n, No. CIV. 06-886-PA, 2007 WL 3544211, at *5 (D. Or. Nov. 14, 2007) (simplified). Only the fifth element is at issue here.

2. Analysis
Jeffords argues in her motion that a strict liability standard applies to her claims, and that summary judgment is appropriate because "NAVEX failed to reinstate her to her position (or equivalent one) after being out on FMLA leave." (Pl.'s Mot. at 26.) According to Jeffords, NAVEX was required to reinstate Jeffords at the end of her FMLA leave no matter what, and its failure to do so results in FMLA liability. The Court disagrees.
Contrary to Jeffords's assertion, FMLA interference claims are not subject to strict liability. See Ambrose, 2014 WL 585376, at *11 ("[Section] 2615(a)(1) is not a strict liability statute.") (quotation omitted); see also Edgar v. JAC Prods. Inc., 443 F.3d 501, 507 (6th Cir. 2006) ("[T]he FMLA is not a strict-liability statute."). Rather, the Ninth Circuit has recognized that "[a]lthough the FMLA created a statutory right to reinstatement after taking FMLA leave, this right is not without limits." Sanders, 657 F.3d at 778; see also id. ("The Department of Labor ('DOL') has interpreted this part of the statute in various regulations that set forth the limitations on an [*13]  employee's right to reinstatement [and a]ll the circuits that have considered the issue have relied on DOL regulations to hold that the FMLA provides an employee with only a limited right to reinstatement.") (citations omitted).
The law is well settled that employers are not liable for interfering with an employee's FMLA rights by terminating an employee who is unable to return to work when her FMLA leave expires. See Ambrose, 2014 WL 585376, at *12 ("Employers are not liable under an interference theory if they 'discharge a person who fails to return to work at the expiration of the twelve week period, even if [the employee] cannot return to work for medical reasons.'" (citing Kleinmark v. St. Catherine's Care Ctr., 585 F. Supp. 2d 961, 963 (N.D. Ohio 2008))).
NAVEX argues that it terminated Jeffords because "at the time [Jeffords's] FMLA leave expired, two of Jeffords's healthcare providers [] had not released her to work in any capacity for at least another three months." (Def.'s Opp'n at 1.) First, "Dr. McNally's [February 28, 2020] FMLA Certification expressly stated that Jeffords was unable to perform all of her job functions" for an indeterminable amount of time. (Def.'s Mot. at 16; Pl.'s Exs. at 15, Jeffords0000167.) Second, "Dr. Zielinski's [March 9, 2020] STD [] Form stated that Jeffords [*14]  was [n]ot released for work' and unequivocally provided: [c]ould [Jeffords] return to work at this time if accommodations were made for the stated restrictions? No.'" (Id.; Def.'s Mot. at 325, NAVEX001078.)
Jeffords responds that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job when her FMLA leave expired and therefore she had a right to reinstatement. (Pl.'s Reply Supp. Mot. Summ. J. ("Pl.'s Reply") at 5, 7.) Specifically, Jeffords asserts there is "ample evidence that [she] was able to return to work on March 16, 2020 [.]" (Id.) However, the only evidence in the record Jeffords cites in support of this assertion is (1) her own post-hoc evaluation "that she was well enough to have a cogent conversation with Chapman and Raz" during her March 16, 2020, termination call (see also Pl.'s Mot. ¶ 77, noting that Jeffords was "conscious" during the call), and (2) post-hoc statements from her HCP contradicting the same HCP's contemporaneous opinion that Jeffords submitted to NAVEX. (Pl.'s Mot. at 26; Pl.'s Reply at 9.)
The record reflects that all of the documentation Jeffords provided to NAVEX demonstrated that her HCPs would not release her to resume work in any capacity, with or [*15]  without restrictions, on the date her FMLA leave expired. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.312(a) ("As a condition of restoring an employee . . . an employer may . . . require [the employee] to obtain and present certification from the employee's health care provider that the employee is able to resume work."). Thus, Jeffords had no right to reinstatement because the only information available to NAVEX stated unequivocally that Jeffords could not resume work at the time her FMLA leave expired. See, e.g., Nelson v. Unified Grocers, Inc., No. 3:10-cv-00531-PK, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4430, 2012 WL 113742, at *1 (D. Or. Jan. 12, 2012) (granting employer's motion for summary judgment where "it is undisputed that [the plaintiff] took the full amount of leave to which he was entitled, and . . . there is no material dispute that [the plaintiff] was unable to work for at least several months post-discharge"); Clink v. Or. Heath & Sci. Univ., No. 3:13-cv-01323-SI, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107307, 2014 WL 3850013, at *9 (D. Or. Aug. 5, 2014) ("[T]he facts demonstrate that [the plaintiff] was unable to perform the essential functions of his position and failed to notify [the defendant] that [he] was able to do so before his FMLA leave exhausted. . . . The Court grants [the defendant's] motion for summary judgment on [the plaintiff s] interference claim related to his reinstatement.") (citations omitted); Santrizos, 2007 WL 3544211, at *6 (granting employer's motion for summary judgment and finding that "[t]he relevant [*16]  fact . . . is the employee's inability to return to work at the end of the leave period [and b]ecause [the] plaintiff would not have been able to return to work at the end of the leave period, denial of the leave did not harm him") (citation omitted).
Jeffords now claims there is a factual dispute regarding whether she could have resumed work when her FMLA leave expired, noting that she was conscious and could speak during the March 16, 2020, phone call,9 and citing Dr. McNally's deposition testimony that working from home might have been an option for Jeffords. (Pl.'s Reply at 5-7.) As an initial matter, it appears Dr. McNally was referencing a time period after Jeffords's FMLA leave had already expired. (See McNally Dep. 95:12-15, referring to Jeffords's restrictions as of June 18, 2020.) But even if Dr. McNally was referring to the relevant time period, his contemporaneous certification indicated Jeffords was unable to perform any of her job duties and would remain incapacitated until "tbd." (Pl.'s Exs. at 15, Jeffords0000167.) Jeffords's ability to participate in one phone call and Dr. McNally's post-hoc contradictory deposition testimony do "not present 'a sufficient disagreement [*17]  to require submission to a jury.' Maxwell v. Kelly Servs. Inc., 730 F. Supp. 2d 1254, 1272 (D. Or. 2010) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52). Rather, both opinions "flatly contradict" the contemporaneous medical evidence that Jeffords was unable to resume work when her FMLA leave expired, which was the only evidence Jeffords provided to NAVEX at the end of her FMLA leave. See Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3 d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir.1996) (affirming the district court's entry of summary judgment for employer where the plaintiff's deposition testimony that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job was "uncorroborated and self-serving" and "flatly contradicts . . . the medical evidence" where the plaintiff had previously represented that she was "completely disabled for work-related purposes").
Jeffords argues in the alternative that her position had no formal job description, and therefore the HCPs who refused to clear her for work "did not know the essential functions of [Jeffords's] position" when they completed her FMLA Certification and STD Form. (Pl.'s Mot. at 5.) However, while the FMLA Certification asks the HCP if the employee is "unable to perform any of his/her job functions due to the condition," the question is immediately preceded by the instruction that "[i]f the employer fails to provide a list of the employee's [*18]  essential functions or a job description, answer these questions based upon the employee's own description of his/her job functions." (Id. at 310, NAVEX001341.) In addition, the STD Form does not reference "essential functions" and instead only asks the HCP to identify a patient's restrictions, accommodations, and whether "your patient can return to work." (Def.'s Mot. at 326, RESTOREPDX000023.) There is no evidence in the record that Jeffords's HCPs were unaware of her job duties, nor that she was unable to provide them with that information.
Jeffords further argues that NAVEX could not require a FMLA certification addressing Jeffords's ability to perform the essential functions of her job unless NAVEX provided her notice of the essential functions of her job as 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(d) requires. (See Pl.'s Reply at 6.) The relevant FMLA regulation requires certification "that the employee is able to resume work." 29 C.F.R. § 825.312(b). Although an employer may further require that the certification specifically address "the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the employee's job" (29 C.F.R. § 825.312(b)), there is no evidence that NAVEX so required here.
When NAVEX approved Jeffords's FMLA leave on December 21, 2019, it provided [*19]  her with a "Leave Response Memo." (See Def.'s Mot. at 291-96, NAVEX000648-53.) The leave memo included a list of "Required Paperwork," including a required "Fitness for Duty" form (the "Form") to submit prior to Jeffords returning to work. (See id.) NAVEX provided the Form to Jeffords as an attachment to the memo. (See id.) The Form asks the HCP to respond to a short series of questions: the date of the medical exam, the date the employee can return from leave, whether the employee's release for duty is to "full, unrestricted duty" or "restricted duty[,]" and if the employee is released to restricted duty, the date the employee can return to full unrestricted duty, the date of the next medical evaluation, and list of any specific work restrictions that apply to the employee at that time. (See id. at 296, NAVEX000653.)
As such, the information NAVEX required the HCP to provide was only whether Jeffords was released to resume work, either restricted or unrestricted. (See, e.g., Tarravechia Depo. at 44:22-24, "[Jeffords] needed a doctor's [note] releasing her back to work, and she didn't have one[;]" Raz 30(b)(6) Depo. at 131:3-5, "We needed to see a fitness for duty form that specified [*20]  her ability to return to her role with or without accommodation"). The STD Form and FMLA Certification that Jeffords's HCPs completed and submitted to NAVEX shortly before her FMLA leave expired clearly state that Jeffords was unable to resume work with or without restrictions at that time. (See Pl.'s Exs. at 15, Jeffords0000167; Def. 's Mot. at 325, NAVEX001078.) NAVEX relied on these two forms and the opinions of Jeffords's HCPs to determine that Jeffords could not resume work when her FMLA leave expired. (See, e.g., Def.'s Mot. at 347, Raz testified that "[a]t the time we were needing to make an employment decision we were in a position where her [HCPs] had specified she could not return for at least 90 days[;]" id. at 382, Chapman testified that "we relied on[] the doctors' information to make a determination of whether you can come back with accommodation o[r] full release, and we had yet to see anything that provided those dates [;]" Pl.'s Mot. Ex. 8 at 44:15-24, Tarravechia responded to the question "what was necessary for [Jeffords] to [] return to work on March 16, 2020" by testifying "[Jeffords] needed a doctor's [note] releasing her back to work, and she didn't have that"). [*21] 
FMLA did not require NAVEX to provide Jeffords with a list of the essential functions of her job, and it is of no consequence that NAVEX did not do so here. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.312(b).
In any event, Jeffords does not identify any essential functions of her job of which she was unaware, and there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Jeffords's HCPs did not understand the essential functions of her job at the time they opined she could not resume work. For these reasons, the Court recommends that the district judge deny Jeffords's motion for partial summary judgment, and grant NAVEX's motion for summary judgment on Jeffords's FMLA interference claim (Count 3).

II. ADA CLAIMS
Jeffords asserts that NAVEX violated the ADA by discriminating against Jeffords's disability (Count 1), failing to engage in the interactive process to accommodate her disability (Count 2), and retaliating against her for engaging in the protected activity of requesting a reasonable accommodation (Count 6). (See FAC 11145-65, 92-100.)

A. Disability Discrimination
In response to Jeffords's claims that NAVEX discriminated against her based on her disability,10 NAVEX argues, inter alia, that Jeffords was not a "qualified individual" and [*22]  therefore "was not protected by the ADA." (See Def.'s Mot. at 17.) The Court agrees.
The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual based on a disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) ("No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment."). "The plaintiff has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of disability discrimination." Kowitz v. City of Portland, No. 3:16-cv-00598-SI, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121700, 2018 WL 3521394, at *1 (D. Or. July 20, 2018) (citing Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1237 (9th Cir. 2012)). "To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show the following: '(1) he [or she] is a disabled person within the meaning of the statute; (2) he [or she] is a qualified individual with a disability; and (3) he [or she] suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability.'" Id. (quoting Mayo v. PCC Structurals, Inc., 795 F.3d 941, 944 (9th Cir. 2015)).
"Courts apply the McDonnell-Douglas burden shifting analysis to claims under the ADA." Id. (citing Curley v. City of N. Las Vegas, 772 F.3d 629, 632 (9th Cir. 2014)); see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). "Thus, if a plaintiff presents a prima facie case of disability discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate a 'legitimate, nondiscriminatory [*23]  reason for the adverse employment action.' Id. (quoting Curley, 772 F.3d at 632). "After the defendant shows a legitimate reason for the employment action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that the defendant's purported reason is merely pretext." Kowitz, 2018 WL 3521394, at *1 (citing Curley, 772 F.3d at 632).
"To be a 'qualified individual' under the ADA, a disabled person generally must be able to perform the 'essential functions' of his or her job 'with or without accommodation.'" Kowitz, 2018 WL 3521394, at *8 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). "The employee bears the burden of demonstrating that he or she is a qualified individual and can perform the essential functions of the job." Id. "[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if no reasonable trier of fact could conclude that [s]he is a 'qualified individual.'" Ambrose, 2014 WL 585376, at *14 (citing Kaplan v. City of N. Las Vegas, 323 F.3d 1226, 1230 n.4 (9th Cir. 2003)).
NAVEX does not dispute that at the time of her termination, Jeffords was a disabled person as defined by the ADA. (See Def.'s Mot. at 17.) Rather, NAVEX argues that "Jeffords was not a qualified individual because, after her initial FMLA leave entitlement ended, she still could not perform the essential functions of her job [and] therefore[] Jeffords was not protected by the ADA." (Id.)
As previously discussed, the record before the Court demonstrates that at the time of Jeffords's [*24]  termination, she could not perform the essential functions of her job with or without accommodation. (See Pl.'s Exs. at 15, Jeffords0000167; Def.'s Mot. at 325, NAVEX001078.) Therefore, no reasonable juror could conclude that Jeffords was a "qualified individual," and Jeffords cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA.11
Accordingly, the Court recommends that the district judge grant NAVEX's motion for summary judgment as to Jeffords's ADA disability discrimination claim (Count 1).

B. Failure to Accommodate and Retaliation
Jeffords alleges that NAVEX failed to accommodate her disability because NAVEX failed to engage in the interactive process or grant her a reasonable accommodation. (See FAC ¶¶ 56-65.) Jeffords also argues that she engaged in the protected activity of requesting a reasonable accommodation, and in response NAVEX retaliated against her by terminating her employment. (See id. ¶¶ 92-100.) NAVEX argues, inter alia, that Jeffords's failure to accommodate and retaliation claims also fail because she was not a "qualified individual" under the ADA. (See Def.'s Mot. at 23-28.)
"To establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under [*25]  the ADA, [the plaintiff] must show that '(1) [s]he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) [s]he is a qualified individual able to perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation; and (3) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action because of [her] disability."' Samper, 675 F.3d at 1237 (quoting Allen v. Pac. Bell, 348 F.3d 1113, 1114 (9th Cir. 2003)).
Having already determined that no reasonable juror could conclude that Jeffords was a qualified individual under the ADA, the Court recommends that the district judge grant NAVEX's motion for summary judgment on Jeffords's ADA failure to accommodate (Count 2) and retaliation (Count 6) claims.12

III. PAY EQUITY CLAIMS
Jeffords claims that NAVEX paid her less than her male colleagues for equal work and that NAVEX treated her "more harshly and less favorably" than its male employees. (See FAC ¶¶ 78-91.) Jeffords relies on the same evidence for both her Title VII and EPA claims.
Under Title VII, it is unlawful for a covered employer to discriminate against any individual based on sex. See, e.g., Maner v. Dignity Health, 9 F.4th 1114, 1120 (9th Cir. 2021) ("Title VII makes it unlawful for a covered employer 'to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual's [*26]  race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.'" (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1))); see also Gunther v. Wash. Cnty., 623 F.2d 1303, 1308 (9th Cir. 1979) ("Under the broad coverage of Title VII [], it is an unlawful employment practice to discriminate against an individual with respect to compensation on the basis of the individual's sex.") (citation omitted).
The EPA, "while specifically designed to prohibit discrimination based on sex in the area of compensation, is somewhat narrower in language." Gunther, 623 F.2d at 1308 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)). "The [EPA] prohibits an employer from discriminating 'between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees . . . at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex . . . for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill[,] effort[,] and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions[.]" Id. (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1)).
"Title VII and the Equal Pay Act overlap because both make unlawful differentials in wages on the basis of a person's sex." Maxwell v. City of Tucson, 803 F.2d 444, 446 (9th Cir. 1986). "Both statutes serve the same fundamental purpose of remedying inequality in the area of compensation, and where an equal pay claim has been raised under either or both statutes, the courts have held that the statutes should be construed harmoniously." [*27]  Gunther, 623 F.2d at 1309 (citation omitted).

A. Title VII
As a threshold matter, under Title VII, an employee must file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") within 300 days after learning of a pay disparity. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(1). It is undisputed that Jeffords did not file a charge of pay discrimination with the EEOC until September 14, 2020, approximately seven years after Jeffords first suspected a pay disparity when she inadvertently received the employee compensation roster.13 (See Jeffords Depo. at 45:1-8, testifying that she received the document "somewhere in 2013"). Accordingly, to the extent Jeffords's Title VII claim is based on pay disparity, her claim is time-barred.
Jeffords nevertheless argues that "[h]er [Title VII] claim is not so limited and is based on Jeffords[] being terminated by NAVEX and treating her more harshly than men, and as background evidence of NAVEX preferring men to women, Jeffords has developed a wealth of record evidence that she should be able to present to the jury which includes all kinds of evidence[.]" (Pl.'s Opp'n at 31.)
Despite claiming a "wealth of record evidence" to support her claim that NAVEX treated her more harshly and less favorably than her male [*28]  counterparts, or that NAVEX terminated her based on her gender, Jeffords cites only to her FAC. (See Pl.'s Opp 'n at 31, citing FAC ¶¶ 78 - 85.) Indeed, the voluminous summary judgment record appears to contain no evidence to support Jeffords's gender discrimination claim. See Gordon v. Virtumundo, Inc., 575 F.3d 1040, 1058 (9th Cir. 2009) ("The party opposing summary judgment must direct the court's attention to specific, triable facts, and the reviewing court is not required to comb through the record to find some reason to deny a motion for summary judgment.") (simplified); see also Hernandez v. Spacelabs Med Inc., 343 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir. 2003) ("[The nonmoving party] cannot defeat summary judgment with allegations in the complaint, or with unsupported conjecture or conclusory statements."). The Court finds that there is no record evidence that would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find that NAVEX violated Title VII by discriminating against Jeffords based on her gender within the applicable statute of limitations.
Accordingly, the Court recommends that the district judge grant NAVEX's motion for summary judgment as to Jeffords's Title VII claim (Count 4).

B. EPA Claim
"Generally, the [EPA] requires that women receive 'equal pay for equal work." Gunther, 623 F.2d at 1309 (citation omitted). The plaintiff bears the burden of [*29]  proving that she did not receive equal pay for equal work, but is not required to show that the jobs performed are identical. See id. "Instead, the plaintiffs may prove a violation of the [EPA] by showing that the skill, efforts, and responsibility required in the performance of the jobs is 'substantially equal.' Id. (citation omitted). "To make this showing, actual job performance and content[,] not job titles, classifications or descriptions is determinative." Id. (citation omitted). "It is the overall job, not its individual segments, that must form the basis of comparison, and, because job duties vary so widely, each suit must be determined on a case-by-case basis." Id. (citation omitted).
A cause of action arising under the EPA must be "commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued, except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued." 29 U.S.C. § 255(a). "[A] claim accrues under federal law when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the actual injury." Lukovsky v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 535 F.3d 1044, 1051 (9th Cir. 2008). "Each discriminatory paycheck [a plaintiff] receive[s] constitutes a separate violation of the EPA with a cause of action accruing (and the [*30]  running of the limitations period commencing) upon the receipt of the discriminatory paycheck." O'Donnell v. Vencor Inc., 466 F.3d 1104, 1113 (9th Cir. 2006).
NAVEX argues that Jeffords's EPA claim is also time-barred. (See Def.'s Mot. at 30.) Alternatively, NAVEX argues that Jeffords "cannot demonstrate that she was paid less than any similarly-situated male employees." (Id. at 32.) Jeffords responds that her unequal pay claims are timely because, inter alia, she filed this action "only a year and a day after she was terminated and well within the two-year statute of limitations for an EPA claim." (Pl.'s Opp 'n at 35.)
As previously discussed, Jeffords's pay equity claim accrued in 2013, when she inadvertently received the employee compensation roster. That roster is the only evidence she offers to support her claim. (See Pl.'s Exs. at 2-9, Jeffords0000004-11.) It was at this time—more than seven years before her termination—that Jeffords knew or had reason to know of the alleged pay disparity. See Lukovsky, 535 F.3d at 1051. Therefore, Jeffords's EPA claim is time-barred.
Even if every paycheck triggered a new statute of limitations, the 2013 spreadsheet is evidence of NAVEX's pay scale in 2013. (See id.) As such, even if the salary spreadsheet creates an issue of disputed [*31]  fact regarding unequal pay for the same work in 2013, NAVEX subsequently promoted Jeffords several times before her March 2020 termination. (See, e.g., Chapman 30(b)(6) Depo. at 15-18, 16:8-13, 18:1-5, 20:4-11.) There is no evidence in the record that Jeffords was paid less than her male colleagues for the same work in any of her subsequent roles at NAVEX. On the contrary, NAVEX CEO Bob Conlin testified that Jeffords "was either the highest or second highest VP in the company . . . the second highest [] paid person on the leadership team" and that "there was no man who had a similar job to hers." (Def.'s Mot. at 390, 15:14-15, 15:19-21; see also Raz Decl. ¶ 9, noting Jeffords was the highest paid vice president in her office outside the sales and executive teams.) Jeffords offers no evidence to the contrary.
For these reasons, the Court concludes that Jeffords's EPA claim is time barred and recommends that the district judge grant NAVEX's motion for summary judgment on that claim (Count 5).

C. Equitable Estoppel and Equitable Tolling
Jeffords alternatively argues that equitable estoppel bars NAVEX from raising a statute of limitations argument to bar her Title VII and EPA claims, because [*32]  NAVEX "should not be allowed to benefit from Chapman's deception." (See Pl.'s Opp 'n at 35.) NAVEX interprets Jeffords's argument as one for equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. (See Def.'s Reply at 21.) For the following reasons, the Court finds that neither doctrine applies.
Equitable tolling and equitable estoppel are two doctrines which may extend a statute of limitations period or prevent a defendant from asserting the defense. See Lukovsky, 535 F.3d at 1051. "'Equitable tolling' focuses on 'whether there was excusable delay by the plaintiff: If a reasonable plaintiff would not have known of the existence of a possible claim within the limitations period, then equitable tolling will serve to extend the statute of limitations for filing suit until the plaintiff can gather what information he needs.' Id. (quoting Johnson v. Henderson, 314 F.3d 409, 414 (9th Cir. 2002)). "Equitable estoppel, on the other hand, focuses primarily on actions taken by the defendant to prevent a plaintiff from filing suit, sometimes referred to as 'fraudulent concealment.' Id. (citing Johnson, 314 F.3d at 414).
To support her argument that equitable estoppel applies here, Jeffords "must point to some fraudulent concealment, some active conduct by the defendant 'above and beyond the wrongdoing upon [*33]  which the plaintiffs claim is filed, to prevent the plaintiff from suing in time.'" Id. at 1052 (quoting Guerrero v. Gates, 442 F.3 d 697, 706 (9th Cir. 2006)). Jeffords relies only on Chapman's alleged "deception." (Pl.'s Opp 'n at 35.) According to Jeffords, "any time [she] brought up [to Chapman] [] pay disparity or gender disparity [] in the business, [she] was shut down and told that [she] was being ridiculous to assume that women and men were treated differently[.]" (See Jeffords Depo. II at 258:20-259:1.) Jeffords could not recall the dates—or even general years—when these conversations took place. (See id. at 258:20-21.)
Even viewed in the light most favorable to Jeffords, her allegation of Chapman's conduct does not rise to the level of "deception" sufficient to invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel. See, e.g., Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 920 F.2d 446, 451 (7th Cir. 1990) (describing circumstances in which equitable estoppel could apply including where a defendant "forged documents purporting to negate any basis" for the plaintiffs claim). Jeffords has not sufficiently alleged any fraudulent conduct, but rather, at most, a general denial of any wrongdoing. To hold that equitable estoppel applies where an employer does not immediately admit wrongdoing when questioned by an employee "would eliminate [*34]  the statute of limitations" altogether. See Lukovsky, 535 F.3d at 1052 (citing Cada for the proposition that "impl[ying] that a defendant is guilty of fraudulent concealment unless it tells the plaintiff, '[w]e 're firing you because of your age [,]' would eliminate the statute of limitations").
Turning to equitable tolling, Jeffords argues that she did "not know[] that she had a claim until she hired counsel[,]" she was unable to verify the "bona fides" of the 2013 spreadsheet until "she brought [this] suit" and engaged in discovery, and when she first became aware that she was "not paid as much as a man doing equal work back in 2013," "she was a happily employed [] employee" and therefore should not have been "required to declare war on and file suit against [NAVEX] to preserve her [wage] claim." (Pl.'s Opp 'n at 36.) Jeffords's arguments do not amount to an "extraordinary circumstance" sufficient to justify tolling of the applicable statute of limitations. See Menominee Indian Tribe of Wis. v. United States, 577 U.S. 250, 251, 136 S. Ct. 750, 193 L. Ed. 2d 652 (2016) ("Because the [plaintiff] cannot establish extraordinary circumstances that stood in the way of timely filing, we hold that equitable tolling does not apply."); see also Booth v. United States, 914 F.3d 1199, 1207 (9th Cir. 2019) (affirming the district court's entry of summary judgment for the defendant based [*35]  on a statute of limitations defense because the plaintiff failed to provide evidence of "any extraordinary circumstance" that would justify equitable tolling).
"Equitable tolling is generally applied in situations 'where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass.'" O'Donnell, 466 F.3d at 1112; see also Booth, 914 F.3d at 1207 ("To obtain equitable tolling a litigant must establish '(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstances stood in his way.'") (citation omitted). That Jeffords did not act on her belief that she was paid less than her male colleagues because she was "happily employed" does not demonstrate an active pursuit of her judicial remedies. (See Pl.'s Opp'n at 36.)
The Court finds that neither equitable estoppel nor equitable tolling apply here. See Low v. Donahoe, 692 F. App'x 373, 374 (9th Cir. 2017) (affirming the district court's entry of summary judgment for the defendants based on a statute of limitations defense and finding that equitable tolling did not apply because the plaintiff "failed to establish that she had been [*36]  pursuing her rights diligently and that some extraordinary circumstances stood in her way" and that equitable estoppel did not apply because, inter alia, "the [defendant's] conduct did not constitute affirmative misconduct") (simplified).

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated, the Court recommends that the district judge DENY Jeffords's partial motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 34) and GRANT NAVEX's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 36).
