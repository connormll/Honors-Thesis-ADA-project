REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. Background and Procedural History
This is a civil action initiated by the filing of a Complaint by pro se Plaintiff Jo Ann Allen ("Allen") on January 30, 2018 (Doc. 1). On February 21, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss (Doc. 6). On April 6, 2018, Defendants filed their brief in support of the motion to dismiss (Doc. 13). Within the time for filing a brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss, Allen filed a brief in opposition (Doc. 17) and a "Simplification & Clarification Amendments of Plaintiff's Claims" (Doc. 18). Finding "no evidence here of undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, futility, or prejudice" and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) (1)(B), the Court construed this document as an Amended Complaint. (Doc. 19 at 2).
In Allen's amended complaint, she [*2]  asserts claims pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C.A. § 2601 et. seq.) ("FMLA"), and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et. seq.) ("ADA"), along with state law claims. Allen names as Defendants 1) the Lackawanna County Board of Commissioners; 2) William Browning, Director of Health & Human Services; 3) Brian Loughney, Deputy of Human Resources; 4) Colin Holmes, AAA Administrator; and 5) Matthew J. Carmody, Attorney. (Doc. 1 at 2-3). Specifically, Allen brings claims pursuant to the ADA, including retaliatory termination (Count 1), disparate impact and treatment (Counts 3 and 4), disability discrimination (Count 5), a catch-all "ADA violations" claim (Count 6), hostile work environment (Count 8), failure to accommodate (Count 9), and retaliatory discharge (Count 10). Allen also brings claims pursuant to the FMLA, including coercion, interference and violations (Count 7), retaliation, and a state law claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count 8) and fraud (Count 2). In sum, and construing Allen's complaint liberally1 Allen alleges that Defendants violated the ADA through disparate treatment and impact, failing to provide a reasonable accommodation, creating a hostile [*3]  work environment, and discharging her in retaliation for her disability. She alleges that Defendants interfered with her FMLA claim and retaliated against her in violation of the FMLA. Finally, she alleges a state law claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and fraud.
Allen's claims arise out of her employment with Lackawanna County, which lasted for over 10 years. (Doc. 18 at 3, Count #3 ¶ 2). She was employed in a Civil Service job. (Doc. 18 at 3). Allen has duress-induced, episodic Anxiety Disorder, which necessitates FMLA intermittent leave when it is triggered or exacerbated. (Doc. 18 at 3). Allen also suffers from Osteoarthritis in her feet and knees, which makes it difficult for her to walk. (Doc. 18 at 1). Lackawanna County is an FMLA approved employer, and approved Allen's leave every year from 2012 through 2016. (Doc. 18 at 3). Lackawanna County ultimately terminated Allen's employment on November 18, 2016. (Doc. 18 at 1).
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in response to Allen's amended complaint (Doc. 21). Allen first submitted a brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss, suggesting that her submission "simplifying and clarifying" her first complaint [*4]  was not an amended complaint at all, but rather a supplemental pleading (Doc. 22 at 1). Allen avers that her "simplification and clarification Amendments" merely duplicated the original complaint, "without any changes, addition, deletions, omissions, etc. of an amended pleading." (Doc. 22 at 2). Therefore, Allen seems to confirm the correctness of the court's interpretation of Doc. 18, despite ostensibly quarrelling with it.2 Defendants subsequently filed a brief in support of the motion to dismiss. (Doc. 25). Allen submitted a second brief in opposition, this time responding to the merits of defendants' brief in support of their motion to dismiss, on August 7, 2018. (Doc. 26). Two weeks later, defendants submitted a reply brief. (Doc. 27). This matter is now fully briefed and ripe for review.
II. Discussion
A. Motion to Dismiss Standard
Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes a defendant to move to dismiss for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). "Under Rule 12(b)(6), a motion to dismiss may be granted only if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court finds the plaintiff's claims lack [*5]  facial plausibility." Warren Gen. Hosp. v. Amgen Inc., 643 F.3d 77, 84 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). Although a court must accept the fact allegations in a complaint as true, it is not compelled to accept "unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences, or a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation." Morrow v. Balaski, 719 F.3d 160, 165 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Baraka v. McGreevey, 481 F.3d 187, 195 (3d Cir. 2007)). Additionally, a court need not assume that a plaintiff can prove facts that the plaintiff has not alleged. Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983).
In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009), the United States Supreme Court held that, when considering a motion to dismiss, a court should "begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. In evaluating a motion to dismiss, a court may consider the facts alleged on the face of the complaint, as well as "documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice." Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007).
B. ADA Claims
As stated above, Allen alleges a number of violations of the ADA, including disparate treatment, failing to provide a reasonable accommodation, hostile [*6]  work environment, and retaliatory discharge. Under the ADA, employers are prohibited from discriminating "against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). A "qualified individual with a disability" is defined by the ADA as a person "with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). A "disability" is defined as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual; (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment."3 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).
In order for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, the plaintiff must show: "(1) he is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA; (2) he is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable [*7]  accommodations by the employer; and (3) he has suffered an otherwise adverse employment decision as a result of discrimination." Gaul v. Lucent Technologies, 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir.1998) (citing Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827, 831 (3d Cir.1996)).
Discrimination under the ADA encompasses not only adverse actions motivated by prejudice and fear of disabilities, but also includes failing to make reasonable accommodations for a plaintiff's disabilities. Taylor v. Phoenixville School Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 306-07 (3d Cir. 1999). The ADA specifies that an employer discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer does "not mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of the individual unless the [employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the [employer]." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).

1. Disparate Impact
Allen alleges a disparate impact claim in Count 3 of her amended complaint (Doc. 18, at 3). Allen alleges that she was replaced by a "younger, non-disabled, and less experienced" individual, that she is a member of an ADA-disability, protected class, and that she was "punished" for having exercised her right to take approved FMLA leave. (Doc. 18, at 3-4).
To establish a prima facie claim of a disparate impact, a plaintiff must show that a facially neutral employment [*8]  practice or policy resulted in a significantly discriminatory hiring pattern. Hanrahan v. Blank Rome LLP, 142 F. Supp. 3d 349, 353-54 (E.D. Pa. 2015); Lanning v. SEPTA, 181 F.3d 478, 485 (3d Cir.1999). To state her claim, Allen must must identify a specific employment practice or policy to challenge, and then demonstrate causation by offering statistical evidence sufficient to show that the practice or policy resulted in discrimination. Id.; Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 994, 108 S.Ct. 2777, 101 L.Ed.2d 827 (1988). Allen identifies a specific policy that she submits discriminates against its employees with ADA disabilities. (Doc. 18, at 3, Count 3, ¶ 3). However, "[I]t is not enough to simply allege that there is a disparate impact on workers, or point to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact." Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228, 241, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005)). Further, Allen must show causation by statistical evidence sufficient to prove that the practice or policy resulted in discrimination, and if she fails to allege facts at the pleading stage or produce statistical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, she cannot make out a prima facie case of disparate impact. Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 135 S.Ct. 2507, 192 L.Ed.2d 514 (June 25, 2015). Allen's disparate impact claim fails in this regard as well. As such, it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss this claim be granted.

2. Hostile Work Environment
Allen alleges a hostile work environment claim relating to her disability in Count [*9]  8 of her amended complaint. (Doc. 18 at 6-7). Success on a hostile work environment claim requires the employee show these five elements:
(1) [she] is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA; (2) she was subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her disability or a request for an accommodation; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and to create an abusive working environment; and (5) [the employer] knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt effective remedial action.
Ballard-Carter v. Vanguard Group, 703 Fed. Appx. 149, 151-52 (3d Cir. 2017).
Here, Allen alleges that she was a qualified individual with a disability, her anxiety disorder. (Doc. 18 at 7 ¶ 1-3). The plaintiff must allege that her disability or request for accommodation was the most significant factor motiving the harasser's behavior. Barclay v. Amtrak, 240 Fed. Appx. 505, 508 (3d Cir. 2007).
Allen lists eight episodes of harassment, as follows:
January 14, 2014: Allen threatened with termination unless she provided in-home visits as part of job duties. (Doc. 18 at 7).
September 25, 2014: Allen disciplined for refusing to provide home visits. (Doc. 18 at 7).
March 11, 2015: Allen suspended for three days without pay; no reason alleged [*10]  in her complaint. (Doc. 18 at 7). Supervisor Donna Kostiak issues infraction to Allen based on deteriorating work performance. (Doc. 18 at 7-8).
April 25, May 23, June 27, and July 22, 2016: Allen served with notices in a procedurally and substantively insufficient manner. (Doc. 18 at 8).
May 23, 2016: Allen's return to work interrupted because Lackawanna County personnel had removed her computer form her desk. (Doc. 18 at 8).
Allen does not allege that these purported instances of harassment were motivated by her supervisors' animus related to her anxiety disorder4. Ballard-Carter, 703 Fed. Appx. at 153. Even if Allen sufficiently alleged the other four elements of a hostile work environment claim, her claim fails because she has not adequately alleged the relationship between these purported acts of harassment and her disability. As such it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss the hostile work environment claim be granted.

3. Failure to Accommodate
Allen alleges that she is a qualified individual under the ADA, but Lackawanna County failed to provide a reasonable accommodation to her known disabilities, both mental (anxiety) and physical (minimize long-distance walking). (Doc. 18 at 4-5 ¶ 1-5); (Doc. 18 at 9 [*11]  ¶ 1). Under the ADA, discrimination encompasses an employer's failure to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity...." Phillips v. Center for Vision Loss, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30186, 2017 WL 839465, *11 (M.D. Pa. March 3, 2017) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). In order to establish a prima facie claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove: "(1) [s]he is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA;" (2) [s]he is otherwise qualified to perform the essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and (3) [s]he has suffered an otherwise adverse employment decision as a result of discrimination[,] "which in this context includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations for a plaintiff's disabilities." Hohider v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 574 F.3d 169, 186 (3d Cir. 2009) (internal quotations omitted). The employee must notify the employer that a reasonable accommodation is necessary in order to trigger the employer's duty to accommodate. Schillaci v. Cargill Meat Solutions, No. 3:CV-12-561, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178548, 2012 WL 6589941, *4 (M.D. Pa. December 18, 2012). The employee then must allege that the accommodation [*12]  was denied. Id.
Regarding her anxiety disability, Allen does not allege that she notified Lackawanna County of the need for a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 18 at 5 ¶ 4). Because the complaint fails to allege that an accommodation was requested, the court cannot assess whether the request was specific enough for defendant to consider it. Therefore, Allen fails to state a claim for a failure to accommodate her anxiety disability. Accord LaGatta v. Pa. Cyber Charter Sch., 726 F.Supp.2d 578, 588-89 (W.D.Pa.2010) (the defendant "cannot be held liable for failing to reasonably provide an accommodation that was never requested").
Regarding her physical disability, Allen alleges that she requested a reasonable accommodation of limited walking and that she and the employer met with the expectation of discussing the accommodation, but ultimately did not discuss it and her employer did not provide one. (Doc. 18 at 9 ¶ 1; 3-4). Allen alleges that she was qualified to perform the essential job function, with or without reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 18 at 9 ¶ 2). Defendants do not contest that Allen's osteoarthritis is an ADA disability. Cf. Schillaci, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178548, 2012 WL 6589941, *4. As such, Allen has stated a prima facie case for failure to accommodate her Allen's Osteoarthritis with the reasonable accommodation [*13]  of limited long-distance walking.
Defendants urge the court to dismiss Allen's failure to accommodate claim based on the "too little, too late" rule of Phillips v. Center for Vision Loss. See 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30186, 2017 WL 839465, and they have submitted documents attached to the motion to dismiss in support of this argument. However, the court in Phillips addressed the claims in that case at the summary judgment stage after the parties engaged in limited discovery. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30186, 2017 WL 839465, *14. The Court has not converted the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, and in reviewing the motion to dismiss, will not consider the documents submitted in support of this argument.56 It is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss Allen's failure to accommodate claim be denied.

4. Retaliation and Disparate Treatment
Allen alleges an ADA retaliation claim in Counts 1, 5, 6, and 10 of her amended complaint, and a disparate treatment claim in Count 4. (Doc. 18). A retaliation claim is considered under the same analytical framework as a disparate treatment claim. Allen v. Verizon Pennsylvania, Inc., 418 F. Supp. 2d 617, 632 (M.D. Pa. 2005) Unlike a plaintiff in an ADA discrimination case, a plaintiff in an ADA retaliation case need not establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability. Krouse v. American Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 502 (3d Cir. 1997) (emphasis in [*14]  original); see also Shellenberger v. Summit Bancorp, Inc., 318 F.3d 183, 190 (3d Cir. 2003) ("the absence of a disability does not translate into an absence of protection under the ADA"). By its own terms, the ADA retaliation provision protects "any individual" who has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by the ADA or who has made a charge under the ADA. Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a)). Because Allen asserts "pretext" on the part of Lackawanna County for the retaliation and does not allege any direct evidence of retaliation, she must establish a prima-facie case under the burden-shifting framework. See Woodson v. Scott Paper Co., 109 F.3d 913, 920 (3d Cir.1997). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) protected employee activity7; (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the employee's protected activity and the employer's adverse action.8 Krouse, 126 F.3d at 500.
If Allen can establish a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to defendants to "articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for their decision. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. If defendants meets this minimal burden, Allen "must point to some evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which a factfinder [*15]  could reasonably ... disbelieve [defendants'] articulated legitimate reasons." Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.1994). A good-faith request for an accommodation is protected activity under the ADA. Shellenberger, 318 F.3d at 191.
In her claim of ADA retaliation, Allen alleges that she made a written request for a reasonable accommodation regarding her osteoarthritis on November 3, 2016. (Doc. 18 at 10 ¶ 1). Allen requested a reasonable accommodation in her long-distance walking on November 3, 2016. (Doc. 18 at 1). Employment termination is a quintessential adverse employment action. Williams v. Philadelphia Housing Authority Police Dept., 380 F.3d 751, 760 (3d Cir. 2004). Lackawanna County issued Allen her discharge notice on November 18, 2016. (Doc. 18 at 1). Determining whether temporal proximity will be sufficiently suggestive to establish causation is necessarily dependent on the facts of each case, and analysis of the probative value of circumstantial evidence in retaliation cases is necessarily very fact-bound and fact-specific.9 Romanaskas v. Earthbox, Inc., No. 3:16-CV-00517, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30451, 2018 WL 1370876, at *3-4 (M.D. Pa. Feb. 23, 2018), report and recommendation adopted, No. 3:16-CV-517, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43641, 2018 WL 1370612 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 16, 2018); comparing Jalil v. Avdel Corp., 873 F.2d 701, 708 (3d Cir. 1989) (employee discharged two days after filing EEOC complaint sufficient evidence of temporal causation) and Moore v. City of Philadelphia, 461 F.3d 331, 352 (3d Cir. 2006) (adverse activity over two months following lawsuit sufficient to establish causation), [*16]  with Leboon v. Lancaster Jewish Community Center Ass'n, 503 F.3d 217, 233 (3d Cir. 2007) (finding that a gap of three months between protected activity and the adverse action, without more, insufficient to create an inference of causation). Although Allen alleges no other evidence of retaliatory animus other than temporal proximity, at the motion to dismiss stage, her complaint is sufficient to state a claim for retaliation under the ADA. Dismissal at the motion to dismiss stage, without the benefit of discovery on the issue of causation, is not appropriate.
For these reasons, Allen sufficiently states a claim for retaliation pursuant to the ADA, and it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss these claims be denied.
C. FMLA Claims
Allen asserts that Defendants violated the FMLA by interfering with her rights under the FMLA, and by retaliating against her for exercising her rights under the FMLA. The primary purposes of the FMLA are to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families and to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons. The FMLA endeavors to accomplish these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers. Callison v. City of Philadelphia, 430 F.3d 117, 119 (3d Cit. 2005). The FMLA "entitles eligible employees [*17]  to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave annually for any of several reasons, including the onset of a 'serious health condition' in an employee's spouse, child, or parent." DeCicco v. Mid-Atl. Healthcare, LLC, 275 F. Supp. 3d 546, 560 (E.D. Pa. 2017); quoting Nevada Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 724, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C)). An employer is prohibited from taking action "to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under" the FMLA (an "interference" claim), and may not "discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful" by the FMLA (a "retaliation" or "discrimination" claim). Callison, 430 F.3d at 119.

1. Interference
In order to make out a claim for interference under the FMLA, a plaintiff must establish that "(1) he or she was an eligible employee under the FMLA; (2) the defendant was an employer subject to the FMLA's requirements; (3) the plaintiff was entitled to FMLA leave; (4) the plaintiff gave notice to the defendant of his or her intention to take FMLA leave; and (5) the plaintiff was denied benefits to which he or she was entitled under the FMLA." DeCicco v. Mid-Atl. Healthcare, LLC, 275 F. Supp. 3d 546, 562 (E.D. Pa. 2017); quoting Ross v. Gilhuly, 755 F.3d 185, 191-92 (3d Cir. 2014). In order "for an interference claim to be viable, the plaintiff must show that FMLA benefits were actually withheld." Id.; quoting Lichtenstein v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 598 Fed.Appx. 109, 113 (3d Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). "[T]he [*18]  employee need not show that he was treated differently than others[, and] the employer cannot justify its actions by establishing a legitimate business purpose for its decision." Thus, "[b]ecause the FMLA [interference claim] is not about discrimination, a McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis is not required." Ross, 755 F.3d at 192.
Allen asserts that her Anxiety Disorder is a medical condition necessitating FMLA leave, and then defendant Lackawanna County "complained on paper, about her forced need to utilize that FMLA accommodation...". (Doc. 18 at 3, count 3 ¶ 1); (Doc. 18 at 6 ¶ 6). Allen acknowledges that she was granted the medical leave, but when she returned was denied "her ACM2, former-job responsibilities." By acknowledging that she was granted the FMLA benefit she sought, in this case medical leave, Allen fails to state a claim against defendants for interference with FMLA rights, and it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss this claim be granted.

2. Retaliation
The FMLAs prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee because the employee exercised her rights under the FMLA or "oppos[ed] any practice made unlawful by" it. Reifer v. Colonial Intermediate Unit 20, 462 F.Supp.2d 621, 638 (M.D. Pa. 2006) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c)). To establish a prima facie case [*19]  of retaliation in violation of the FMLA, the plaintiff must show that 1) she engaged in an activity protected under the statute, 2) she suffered an adverse employment decision; and 3) the adverse decision was causally related to the exercise of her FMLA rights. Id. at 639. If Allen can do so, the burden of production shifts to defendants to "articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for their decision.10 McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. If defendants meets this minimal burden, Allen "must point to some evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which a factfinder could reasonably ... disbelieve [defendants'] articulated legitimate reasons." Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.1994).
Medical leave is an activity protected by the FMLA. Lichtenstein v. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 691 F.3d 294, 307 (3d Cit. 2012). The Supreme Court has defined an adverse employment action as a "significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits." Clark v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, 701 Fed. Appx. 113, 117 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Burlington Indus. Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 749, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998)). When assessing whether the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action is close enough for the court to infer a causal link, the court counts days from the time plaintiff alleges the protected activity ended and the adverse employment action took place. Murphy, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27411, 2017 WL 770653, *5.
 [*20] Here, Allen asserts the protected activity of FMLA leave, from which she returned July 18, 2016. (Doc. 18 at 4 ¶ 5). Allen also alleges that she was "functional(ly) demot(ed)... then, replaced... within days of medical-leave return." (Doc. 18 at 6 ¶ 7). Allen states a prima facie face because a functional demotion could plausibly be an adverse employment action, and mere days is close enough for a court to infer a causal link between the FMLA leave and the functional demotion. See Jalil, 873 F.2d at 708 (two days between the protected activity and alleged retaliation sufficient to infer a causal link). As with the ADA retaliation claim, Allen's complaint is sufficient to state a claim for retaliation under the ADA, and dismissal at the motion to dismiss stage, without the benefit of discovery on the issue of causation, is not appropriate. As such, it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss be denied.
D. Remaining State Law Claims
Allen alleges two state law claims - intentional infliction of emotional distress11 and fraud.

1. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Liberally construing her complaint, Allen alleges within Count 8, that the Defendants "deliberately inflicted emotional-distress" upon [*21]  her, causing psychological harm and the need to use FMLA leave. (Doc. 18, at 8).
At its most basic, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress requires a plaintiff establish: (1) that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous; (2) that the conduct was intentional or reckless; (3) the conduct caused emotional distress; and (4) the distress was severe. See Chuy v. Phila. Eagles Football Club, 595 F.2d 1265, 1273 (3d Cir. 1979). "The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress requires a showing that the defendant[ ] acted in a manner so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized society." McGreevy v. Stroup, 413 F.3d 359, 371 (3d Cir. 2005) (internal citations omitted). Generally, the case is one in which the recitation of the facts to an average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor, and lead him to exclaim, "Outrageous!" Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 46 commend d; Hunger v. Grand Cent. Sanitation, 447 Pa. Super. 575, 670 A.2d 173, 177 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1996). Further, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED") requires physical injury, harm, or illness caused by the defendant's conduct. Dempsey v. Bucknell Univ., 76 F. Supp. 3d 565, 589 (M.D. Pa. 2015). The Court's role at the motion to dismiss stage is something of a gate-keeper, ensuring that the facts of the complaint afford relief. [*22]  Moyer v. Lebanon Cty., No. 3:16-CV-01424, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 213261, 2017 WL 6989168, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Dec. 28, 2017), report and recommendation adopted, No. 3:16-CV-1424, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8126, 2018 WL 472444 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 18, 2018).
The acts alleged must involve the "most egregious conduct," and thus "it is extremely rare to find conduct in the employment context that will rise to the level of outrageousness necessary to provide a basis for recovery for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress." Hoy v. Angelone, 554 Pa. 134, 720 A.2d 745, 754 (Pa. 1998) (quoting Cox v. Keystone Carbon, 861 F.2d 390, 395 (3d Cir. 1988)); see Palma v. Volunteers of Am., No. 04-919, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5176, 2006 WL 328352, at *8 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 9, 2006) ("Application of the doctrine is 'most limited' and 'extremely rare' in the employment context."). Intentional infliction of emotional distress claims in employment cases have been limited to instances where "'an employer engaged in both sexual harassment and other retaliatory behavior against an employee.'" Bartos v. MHM Servs., Inc., No. 3:CV-09-1018, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141077, 2009 WL 10677835, at *2 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 14, 2009); quoting Wilkins v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., No. 03-6610, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20305, 2005 WL 2271866, at *9 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 15, 2005) (quoting Hoy, 720 A.2d at 754).
Allen has failed to plead a viable claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, as none of the conduct complained, if proven, would amount to extreme and outrageous conduct as a matter of law. As such, it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss this claim be granted.

2. Fraud
Allen alleges that various Lackawanna County employees committed fraud during her unemployment compensation hearing.12 (Doc. 18 at 1-2). The office of [*23]  Employment Security determined Allen eligible for unemployment compensation benefits. (Doc. 18 at 1-2 ¶ 1). A referee then reversed her benefits, based on an email statement of policy submitted by Lackawanna County regarding its computer usage policy. (Doc. 18 at 2 ¶ 3). The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review ("Board") then upheld the referee's order denying Allen unemployment benefits. (Doc. 18 at 2 ¶ 6). The only named defendants mentioned in the state law fraud claim are William Browning ("Browning"), Lackawanna County Area Agency on Aging ("AAA") director, as well as Lackawanna County itself.
To assert a claim of fraud Plaintiff must allege: "(1) representation; (2) which is material to the transaction at hand; (3) made falsely, with the knowledge of its falsity or recklessness as to whether it is true or false; (4) with the intent of misleading another into relying on it; (5) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation; and (6) the resulting injury was proximately caused by the reliance." Foster v. JLG Industries, 372 F. Supp. 2d 792, 800 (M.D. Pa. 2005) (quoting Feeney v. Disston Manor Personal Care Home, Inc., 2004 PA Super 114, 849 A.2d 590, 597 (Pa. Super.2004)). Further, "pursuant to Rule 9(b), a plaintiff averring a claim in fraud must specify "'the who, what, when, where, and how: the first paragraph of any newspaper story.'" [*24]  Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig., 180 F.3d 525, 534 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting DiLeo v. Ernst & Young, 901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir.1990)). 'Although Rule 9(b) falls short of requiring every material detail of the fraud such as date, location, and time, plaintiffs must use "alternative means of injecting precision and some measure of substantiation into their allegations of fraud.'" In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props. Secs. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting In re Nice Sys., Ltd. Sec. Litig., 135 F.Supp.2d 551, 577 (D.N.J.2001), emphasis supplied)." Animal Science Products, Inc. v. China Nat. Metals & Minerals Import & Export Corp., 596 F.Supp.2d 842, 878 (D.N.J., 2008).
Allen asserts that a fraud was committed upon the Pennsylvania Employment Compensation Board when Karen Schimelfenig, not a party to this action, testified to AAA's computer usage policy, which states in part that staff are required to perform work on an agency issued computer. (Doc. 18 at 2 ¶ 3). Allegedly, Allen breached this policy, Browning became aware of said breach, and her breach of official policy contributed to her job loss. (Doc. 18 at 2 ¶ 6). Defendants assert that Allen cannot establish a prima facie case, and in support of that argument rely upon documents submitted in support of a prior motion to dismiss that purport to defeat Allen's claim. Again, at this procedural juncture, the Court will not examine documents outside the scope of the pleadings, and will not convert this motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Defendants offer no other argument with Allen's common law fraud [*25]  claim, and it appears that, liberally construing the claim of fraud, Allen has sufficiently alleged a cognizable claim. As such, it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss this claim be denied.

III. Leave to Amend
The Third Circuit has instructed that district courts generally must permit a curative amendment if a complaint filed pro se is vulnerable to dismissal for failure to state a claim, unless an amendment would be inequitable or futile. Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir. 2002). However, the Third Circuit has also acknowledged that a district court has "substantial leeway in deciding whether to grant leave to amend." Lake v. Arnold, 232 F.3d 360, 373 (3d Cir. 2000).
It is recommended that Allen be allowed an opportunity to file a single, unified, legible complaint setting forth factual allegations and legal claims in a manner that can be reviewed by the Court and, if necessary, answered by defendants. The amended complaint must be a pleading that stands by itself without reference to the original complaint. Young v. Keohane, 809 F. Supp. 1185, 1198 (M.D. Pa. 1992) (emphasis added). Further, the amended complaint must be "simple, concise, and direct" as required by Rule 8(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It must also be limited to those claims that arise out of the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences as averred, albeit [*26]  vaguely, in the original complaint. All claims should be set out in individual, numbered counts. Failure to file an amended complaint in accordance with the aforementioned requirements will result in the dismissal of this action in its entirety. The court does not find allowing an amended complaint would be inequitable to defendants.

IV. Recommendation
Based on the foregoing, it is recommended that the Court grant defendants' Motion to Dismiss, in part. Specifically, it is recommended as follows:
1. The Court DENY Defendants' motion to dismiss Allen's ADA Failure to Accommodate, Retaliation, and Disparate Treatment Claims, FMLA Retaliation Claim, and State Law Fraud Claim;
2. The Court GRANT Defendants' motion to dismiss Allen's ADA Disparate Impact Claim, Hostile Work Environment Claim, FMLA Interference Claim, and State Law Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claim;
3. The Court GRANT Allen 21 days from the date of the District Court's adoption of this Report and Recommendation to file a complete amended complaint; and
4. This matter be remanded to the undersigned for further proceedings.
