Opinion



UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Before the Court is the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Lockheed Martin Corporation, doing business as Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, (hereinafter "Defendant," "Lockheed," or "the Company"). [Doc. 52]. For the reasons below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the motion be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

I. Background
Plaintiff alleges that Lockheed terminated his employment, failed to accommodate his disability and retaliated against him in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), and that it interfered with his rights and retaliated against him in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). As required when considering a motion for summary judgment, the Court [*2]  has viewed the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the nonmoving party. See United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop., 941 F.2d 1428, 1437 (11th Cir. 1991) (en banc). To the extent that material facts are in dispute, the Court has resolved the disputes in Plaintiff's favor. See Vaughan v. Cox, 343 F.3d 1323, 1326 n.1 (11th Cir. 2003). The facts of the case, for the purpose of adjudicating Lockheed's motion, are therefore as follows:1

A. Plaintiff's Employment
Plaintiff worked for Defendant for 29 years and was an Inspector in the Quality Assurance Department at the time of his termination. (Pl. SOF ¶¶ 1, 2; Def. Resp. ¶¶ 1, 2; Def. SOF ¶¶ 20, 21; Pl. Resp. ¶¶ 20, 21).2

B. Attendance Standards
Lockheed's Attendance Standards for Hourly Employees, including Plaintiff, are set forth in Supplement H of the Collective Bargaining Agreement jointly negotiated by Lockheed and the Union. (Def. SOF ¶¶ 1, 2; Pl. Resp. ¶¶ 1, 2; Pl. SOF ¶ 19; Def. Resp. ¶ 19); [Doc. 50-1 at 19-29]. Defendant has a progressive discipline policy for attendance issues. (Def. SOF ¶¶ 4, 5; Pl. Resp. ¶¶ 4, 5; Pl. SOF ¶ 24; Def. Resp. ¶ 24); [see Doc. 50-1 at 24-26]. "Absence" is defined as "[a] full day's absence (excluding vacation and holiday - when not scheduled to work)." [Doc. 50-1 at 22]. A "tardy" is defined as [*3]  "[a] part-day absence at the start of the shift." [Id.]. "Unsatisfactory attendance" means to have a Verbal Warning or greater. [See id.]. According to the Attendance Standards, paid sick and injury leave time are not counted as attendance irregularities, nor are absences caused by a reason deemed excusable under the terms of the FMLA. (Def. SOF ¶ 7); [Doc. 50-1 at 22, 23].
An employee's attendance is considered unacceptable if he has five or more chargeable attendance irregularities in any continuous six month period. (Def. SOF ¶ 6; Pl. Resp. ¶ 6); [Doc. 50-1 at 22]. As long as an employee does not currently have a disciplinary action on his record for unsatisfactory attendance, consecutive days of absence caused by the same illness are considered a single occurrence and grouped as one absence; conversely, if an employee has a current disciplinary action on record for unsatisfactory attendance, consecutive absences are not grouped. (Def. SOF ¶¶ 9, 10; Pl. Resp. ¶¶ 9, 10); [Doc. 50-1 at 23]. An employee who does not currently have a disciplinary action on his record for unsatisfactory attendance is allowed one tardy per month, which must be one hour or less in duration, and such tardiness [*4]  is not then counted as a chargeable attendance irregularity; however, no more than three tardies are allowed in a six month period. (Def. SOF ¶ 8; Pl. Resp. ¶ 8); [Doc. 50-1 at 23]. Although Supplement H provides that employees must, within two hours of the start of the first shift, report any absences to the designated absence report number, [Doc. 50-1 at 23-24], employees in the Quality Assurance Department were permitted to report their absences directly to their supervisor. (Pl. SOF. ¶¶ 29, 30; Deposition of Mark Campbell, [Doc. 62 at 9-10] ("Campbell Dep."); Deposition of Stephen Ansley, [Doc. 60 at 10-12] ("Ansley Dep."); Deposition of Brett Tonkin, [Doc. 66 at 32-33], ("Tonkin Dep."); Deposition of R.C. Brown, [Doc. 61 at 13, 16, 20-21] ("Brown Dep.")).3 If an employee fails to report an absence without a reasonable explanation for failure to notify the Company, that employee is given an infraction under the Attendance policy and it is treated as a failure to follow instructions. [Doc. 50-1 at 24].
An employee whose attendance is unacceptable, i.e., with five or more irregularities in a continuous six-month period, is given a verbal warning. (Def. SOF ¶ 12; Pl. [*5]  Resp. ¶ 12; Pl. SOF ¶ 25; Def. Resp. ¶ 25); [Doc. 50-1 at 24-25]. If within a year of receiving a verbal warning, the employee has five or more additional attendance irregularities within a six-month period, he will be given an Employee Performance Notice ("EPN"). (Def. SOF ¶ 13; Pl. Resp. ¶ 13; Pl. SOF ¶ 26; Def. Resp. ¶ 26); [Doc. 50-1 at 25]. At each step of the discipline process, "only those infractions since the last step of formal discipline will be considered." [Doc. 50-1 at 25]. If within a year of receiving an EPN for attendance, the employee has five or more additional irregularities within a six-month period, he will be given an EPN-plus-suspension. (Def. SOF ¶ 14; Pl. Resp. ¶ 14; Pl. SOF ¶ 27; Def. Resp. ¶ 27); [Doc. 50-1 at 25]. If within a year of receiving an EPN-plus-suspension, the employee has five or more additional attendance irregularities within a six-month period, he will be discharged. (Def. SOF ¶ 15; Pl. Resp. ¶ 15); [Doc. 50-1 at 25]. Before the final decision is made regarding termination, an Attendance Disciplinary Review Committee ("ARC") meeting is held and is usually attended by representatives from Labor Relations, the employee's management, and the [*6]  Union. (Def. SOF ¶¶ 16, 17; Pl. Resp. ¶ 17; Pl. SOF ¶ 28; Def. Resp. ¶ 28); [Doc. 50-1 at 25-26]. During the Attendance Disciplinary Review meeting, the Union representative has the opportunity to inform the company of any mitigating circumstances for the company to consider. (Def. SOF ¶ 18; Pl. Resp. ¶ 18); [see Doc. 50-1 at 25-26].

C. FMLA Policy
Defendant maintains a Family and Medical Leave Corporate Policy Statement (CPS-535). (Def. SOF ¶ 61; Pl. Resp. ¶ 61); [Doc. 61-1 at 2-9]. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, the division in which Plaintiff worked, also maintains a Family and Medical Leave of Absence policy which defines the process and identifies the roles for managing medical leave of absence under the FMLA. (Def. SOF ¶ 62; Pl. Resp. ¶ 62); [Doc. 52-10 at 17-20]. In order for an employee to get an attendance infraction coded as FMLA-approved, the employee is required to submit a completed FMLA request form to the Medical Leave Operations Center ("FMLA office") within two days of the time off; failure to do so could result in the request for leave being denied. (Def. SOF ¶¶ 63, 64; Pl. Resp. ¶¶ 63, 64; Pl. SOF ¶ 42; Def. Resp. ¶ 42). The form may be obtained from the FMLA [*7]  office and can be returned by leaving it in a dropbox. (Def. SOF ¶¶ 69, 70; Pl. Resp. ¶ 69; Pl. SOF ¶ 43; Def. Resp. ¶ 43). Sharon Cline is responsible for processing employee requests for FMLA leave and performs her duties in the FMLA office. (Def. SOF ¶ 67; Pl. Resp. ¶ 67; Deposition of Sharon Cline, [Doc. 52-10], ("Cline Dep.") at ¶¶ 6, 7).
During all relevant times, Plaintiff took intermittent FMLA leave. (Def. SOF ¶ 76; Pl. Resp. ¶ 76). Plaintiff was familiar with Defendant's FMLA process as he had completed FMLA Request Forms on many occasions throughout his employment. (Def. SOF ¶ 77; Pl. Resp. ¶ 77).

D. Plaintiff's Infractions

1. Infractions Leading to Verbal Warning
Plaintiff was absent from work from March 14-17, 2011 and received one infraction for this period. (Pl. SOF ¶ 64); [Doc. 50-6 at 7; Doc. 65-1 at 86].
Plaintiff again was absent on March 28, 2011 and received one infraction. [Doc. 50-6 at 7]; (see Pl. SOF ¶ 65). Plaintiff submitted his FMLA request form for the March 28, 2011 absence, it was received by the FMLA office on March 31, 2011, but it does not appear to have been approved. See (Pl. SOF ¶ 65); [Doc. 65-1 at 38] (compare approved FMLA request for March 7-9, 2011, [*8]  [Doc. 50-6 at 7; Doc.65-1 at 37]; (Pl. SOF ¶ 63; Def. Resp. ¶ 63)).
Plaintiff was absent from April 20-22, 2011 and received one infraction. [Doc. 50-6 at 7]; (see Pl. SOF ¶ 67).4
Plaintiff was absent on May 2-3, 2011 and received two infractions. [Doc. 50-6 at 7; Doc. 65-1 at 86]; (see Pl. SOF ¶ 68).
Plaintiff was absent from May 4-6, 2011. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 69); [see also Doc. 50-6 at 6-7; Doc. 65-1 at 85-86]. Plaintiff submitted his FMLA request form for those dates. (Pl. SOF ¶ 69); [Doc. 65-1 at 42].5 Plaintiff received one infraction each for May 4, 2011 and May 5, 2011 and did not receive an infraction for May 6, 2011. [Doc. 50-6 at 6].6
Plaintiff was absent on July 5-7 and 11, 2011. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 68); [see also Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 85]. Plaintiff submitted an FMLA request form for those dates on July 12, 2011, which was received the same day. [Doc. 65-1 at 43]. Plaintiff received three infractions for July 5-7, 2011. [Doc. 50-6 at 6]. On July 12, 2011, Plaintiff was issued a Verbal Warning for "non report" of his absences that occurred July 6-7, 2011. [Id.]; (see also Pl. SOF ¶ 71). Plaintiff's FMLA request appears to have been approved, however, the infractions were [*9]  not overridden because Plaintiff was given a verbal warning for "non-report." [See Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 43, 85]. Plaintiff did in fact call Ansley on July 5 and 6, 2011. (Pl. SOF ¶ 73; Ansley Dep. at 15); [Doc. 50-6 at 1].7

2. Infractions Leading to EPN
Plaintiff was absent on July 29, 2011 for four hours and received one infraction. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 78); [Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 84].

Plaintiff was absent from August 23-25, 2011 and received three infractions. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 81); [Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 84].
Plaintiff was absent from September 13-15, 2011 and received three infractions. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 83); [Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 84].
Plaintiff was absent on September 29, 2011 and received one infraction. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 84); [Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 84].
Plaintiff was absent on October 19, 2011 and received one infraction. [Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 84].
On October 26, 2011, Plaintiff received an EPN for unsatisfactory attendance. (Pl. SOF ¶ 59); [Doc. 50-4 at 13; Doc. 50-6 at 6]. The EPN stated that "[f]ailure to improve your [*10]  attendance immediately can/will result in more severe discipline including termination of your employment with Lockheed Martin Aero." (Def. SOF ¶ 47); [Doc. 50-4 at 13].

3. Infractions Leading to EPN-plus-suspension
Plaintiff was absent on October 31, 2011 and received one infraction. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 87); [Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 84].
Plaintiff was absent from November 14-18, 2011. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 88); [Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 84].

Plaintiff received two infractions for November 14-15, 2011 and FMLA leave was coded as approved for November 16-18, 2011; Plaintiff did not receive any infractions for November 16-18, 2011. [Doc. 50-6 at 6].8

Plaintiff was absent from work from January 17-19, 2012 and received three infractions. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 91); [Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 83]. Plaintiff was absent from work on February 23, 2012 for 2.5 or 3 hours
and received one infraction. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 92); [*11]  [Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 51, 83]. Plaintiff submitted an FMLA Request Form the same day, which was denied. [Doc. 65-1 at 51].
Plaintiff was absent from work from February 27, 2012 through March 1, 2012, but only received two infractions during this time period. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 90); [Doc. 50-6 at 6; Doc. 65-1 at 83].9
On March 5, 2012, Plaintiff received an EPN-plus-suspension. (Pl. SOF ¶ 94; Def. Resp. ¶ 94); [Doc. 50-4 at 14]. Plaintiff was "advised to initiate corrective action to improve [his] attendance to avoid further disciplinary action to include termination of . . . employment with Lockheed Martin." (Def. SOF ¶ 49); [Doc. 50-4 at 14].

4. Infractions Leading to Recommendation of Termination

Plaintiff was absent from work on December 17, 2012 and received one infraction. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 100; Def. SOF ¶ 50); [Doc. 50-6 at 5; Doc. 65-1 at 80].
Plaintiff was absent on January 3, 2013 in which he used 4 hours as vacation, 4 hours as personal illness/casual time, and 1 hour was an unpaid personal illness time. [Doc. 65-1 at 80]. Plaintiff received one [*12]  infraction for the one hour that was unpaid. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 101; Def. SOF ¶ 50);10 [Doc. 50-6 at 5].
Plaintiff received an infraction for being absent on January 24, 2013. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 102; Def. SOF ¶ 50); [Doc. 50-6 at 5].11
Plaintiff was absent on January 28, 2013 and received one infraction. (See Pl. SOF ¶ 103; Def. SOF ¶ 50); [Doc. 50-6 at 5; Doc. 65-1 at 80].

E. Attendance Review Committee and Termination
The Attendance Review Committee ("ARC") meeting was held on February 22, 2013, attended by Labor Relations Representative Lynn Stell, Union Representative James Butler, Quality Analyst R.C. Brown, Labor Relations Representative Matt Evans, and Senior Manager Rene Letourneau. (Def. SOF ¶ 54; Pl. Resp. ¶ 54; Pl. SOF ¶¶ 115, 116; Def. Resp. ¶¶ 115, 116). In preparation for the meeting, on February 7, 2013, Stell contacted Cline at the FMLA office to determine if any of the most recent infractions were FMLA-approved, and Cline responded that they were not. (Def. SOF ¶¶ 52, 53; Pl. Resp. ¶¶ 52, 53).
On February 20, 2013, Plaintiff informed Campbell, his immediate supervisor, and Tonkin, Department Manager, that he would be taking continuous FMLA leave for back surgery. (Def. SOF ¶ 85; [*13]  Pl. Resp. ¶ 85; Pl. SOF ¶ 68). Although the members of the review committee were aware of Plaintiff's intermittent FMLA use, the members did not know that Plaintiff had requested continuous FMLA leave for back surgery. (See Def. SOF ¶ 87; Pl. Resp. ¶ 87).
On February 26, 2013, Tonkin informed Plaintiff by letter that his employment was terminated for violation of the Attendance Standards. (Def. SOF ¶ 59; Pl. Resp. ¶ 59); [Doc. 50-4 at 15].

F. Procedural History
On November 5, 2014, Plaintiff filed this action asserting claims under the FMLA and the ADA. [Doc. 1]. Defendant filed this motion for summary judgment on February 3, 2016. [Doc. 52]. Plaintiff filed a response on March 21, 2016, [Doc. 59], and Defendant replied on April 21, 2016, [Doc. 67]. With briefing completed, the Court now considers the pending motion.

II. Summary Judgment Standard
"Summary judgment is proper where 'the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.'" Tana v. Dantanna's, 611 F.3d 767, 772 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). The movant carries the initial burden of "informing the court of the basis for its [*14]  motion and of identifying those materials that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 232 F.3d 836, 840 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing Celotex Corp v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). A fact is "material" if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The moving party may also meet its burden by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support an element of the case on which the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. "Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
The nonmovant is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, admissions, and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmovant's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. "[F]acts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there is a 'genuine' dispute as to those facts." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007). "When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that [*15]  no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Id. If the record does not blatantly contradict the nonmovant's version of events, the court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also EPL Inc. v. USA Fed. Credit Union, 173 F.3d 1356, 1362 (11th Cir. 1999); Duke v. Cleland, 884 F. Supp. 511, 514 (N.D. Ga. 1995). On the other hand, if the record presents disputed issues of material fact, the Court may not decide them; rather, it must deny the motion and proceed to trial. FindWhat Inv. Grp. v. FindWhat.com, 658 F.3d 1282, 1307 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing Tullius v. Albright, 240 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir. 2001)).

III. Discussion
Plaintiff's complaint alleges that he has serious health conditions including asthma and back injury that are disabilities as defined by the ADA, and that he was approved for and used intermittent FMLA for these serious health conditions. [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 16, 17]. Plaintiff contends that certain FMLA-covered absences were improperly used as a basis for his termination. [Id. ¶¶ 20, 24]. He also claims that he was terminated within days of informing his supervisors that he needed to take continuous FMLA for back surgery. [Id. ¶¶ 25, 26, 28, 36]. He additionally alleges that he was terminated for requesting a reasonable accommodation of intermittent [*16]  and continuous FMLA leave. [Id. ¶¶ 35, 36, 39, 40]. He further contends that he was terminated in retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation of continuous FMLA leave for the back surgery in violation of the ADA. [Id. ¶¶ 50-53]. Plaintiff additionally claims FMLA interference when Defendant terminated him, thus preventing him from exercising his rights under the FMLA. [Id. ¶¶ 59-60]. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant retaliated against him in violation of the FMLA for attempting to exercise his right to take leave under the FMLA. [Id. ¶ 66].

A. FMLA
The FMLA grants an eligible employee the right to take up to twelve workweeks of unpaid leave annually for any of several reasons, including "[b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). The FMLA prohibits an employer from: (1) "interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing], or deny[ing] the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right" under the FMLA; or (2) "discharg[ing] or in any other manner discriminat[ing] against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by" the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1), (2).
Although the FMLA "'uses the language of interference, [*17]  restraint, denial, discharge, and discrimination, not retaliation, . . . nomenclature counts less than substance. And the substance of the FMLA . . . is that an employer may not do bad things to an employee who has exercised or attempted to exercise any rights under the statute.'" Smith v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 273 F.3d 1303, 1313 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 n.5 (11th Cir. 2000)). Under this interpretation of the FMLA, the Eleventh Circuit has stated as follows:
[T]he FMLA creates two types of claims: interference claims, in which an
employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act, . . . , and retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act . . . .
Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted); see also Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1206). To state a claim for interference with a substantive right under the FMLA, the plaintiff "need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that [s]he was entitled to the benefit denied." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1206-07. "Interfering with" the exercise of FMLA rights includes both "refusing to authorize FMLA leave . . . [and] discouraging an employee from using such leave." 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(b). When bringing an interference claim, "[t]he employee need not allege that his employer [*18]  intended to deny the benefit—the employer's motives are irrelevant." Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1293. Conversely, to state a claim for retaliation under the FMLA, the plaintiff "must demonstrate that his employer intentionally discriminated against him in the form of an adverse employment action for having exercised an FMLA right"; in other words, in the context of FMLA retaliation, the plaintiff shoulders the increased burden of showing that the defendant's actions "were motivated by an impermissible or discriminatory animus." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207 (internal quotation marks omitted).

1. FMLA Interference Claims

a. Argument of the Parties
Defendant argues that as to Plaintiff's intermittent FMLA requests, only two requests are at issue: the infractions incurred on January 3, 2013 and January 28, 2013 that occurred after the EPN-plus-suspension that led to termination. [Doc. 52-1 at 18]. Defendant contends that Plaintiff was not entitled to FMLA leave for these dates because he failed to comply with the company's usual and customary procedural requirements for requesting leave: namely, that Plaintiff did not submit an FMLA Request Form to the FMLA office within two days of his absence. [Id. at 18-19]. Defendant recognizes that Plaintiff contends that [*19]  he did submit the request forms, however, Defendant argues that neither the Company nor Plaintiff have a record of either request form and Plaintiff made no attempt to check the status of his requests as
he had done in the past. [Id. at 9, 19 (citing (Def. SOF ¶ 78))]. Defendant also maintains that it did not terminate Plaintiff's employment to interfere with his right to take continuous FMLA leave, because the record demonstrates that Plaintiff's attendance was referred to the ARC weeks before he requested continuous leave, and none of the decisionmakers was aware at the time the termination decision was made that Plaintiff had sought continuous FMLA leave. [Id. at 21].
In response, Plaintiff argues that each of his absences leading up to the Verbal Warning were in fact absences that were FMLA-covered and that they should not have been coded as infractions. [Doc. 59 at 5-6]. Plaintiff also argues that he was given a verbal warning in July 2011 for not calling in, not for attendance infractions, and, although Plaintiff submitted FMLA paperwork that day for the absence, the FMLA office refused to code the absence as FMLA-covered because he had received a verbal warning for non-report. [Id. at 6-7]. Thus, Plaintiff [*20]  argues, he had no attendance infractions and should not have been given a verbal warning. [Id. at 7].
Plaintiff next argues that the infractions leading up to the EPN also were FMLAcovered, with the exception of the infraction he was given on August 12, 2011 for being tardy, as to which Plaintiff claims that he should have received a free tardy. [Id. at 7-8]. Plaintiff contends that Defendant continued to use FMLA-covered leave as a negative factor in discipline as the infractions leading up to the EPN-plus-suspension were FMLA-covered absences. [Id. at 8-9].
For the infractions leading up to his termination, Plaintiff argues that the infraction for August 22, 2012 should have been coded as a free tardy; on December 17, 2012, he was out sick; and he submitted an FMLA request for his absences for January 3 and 28, 2013. [Id. at 9-10]. Plaintiff also argues that he recertified his FMLA request on January 28, 2013 and, therefore, his infraction for his January 24, 2013 absence should have been retroactively coded as FMLA-approved. [Id. at 9-10]. Plaintiff claims that he was terminated while approved for intermittent FMLA leave, and thus Defendant unlawfully interfered with his use of FMLA by denying him entitlement to continue using his [*21]  already-approved intermittent FMLA leave. [Id. at 10].
Next, Plaintiff argues that he complied with Defendant's procedural requirements when he took intermittent FMLA leave because he submitted FMLA requests to the FMLA office as required. [Id. at 11]. Plaintiff argues that he did not keep copies of the requests because the standard procedure was that an employee would obtain and fill out the form at the FMLA office and leave it in the drop box. [Id.]. Plaintiff maintains that no one encouraged Plaintiff to make copies and there was no copy machine in the FMLA office to make a copy. [Id. at 11-12]. Plaintiff argues that, despite the fact that he turned in requests, the FMLA office failed to code his leave as FMLA-covered. [Id. at 12]. Plaintiff argues that he even talked to Stell about the fact that his absences were not being properly coded while he was going through the recertification process. [Id.].
Finally, Plaintiff contends that the ARC is a cat's paw.12 [Id. at 12-14]. Plaintiff argues that the ARC is nothing but a rubber stamp for prior discipline and Defendant attempts to use the ARC to deflect its responsibility for Plaintiff's claims. [Id. at 12]. Plaintiff argues that the Committee was not provided with the underlying disciplinary [*22]  documents and FMLA records, and no investigation was done to determine whether the previous discipline was warranted. [Id.]. Plaintiff submits that, in preparation for the ARC meeting, Stell did not have any conversations with anyone regarding Plaintiff's attendance, he did not investigate Plaintiff's prior discipline to determine if it was properly given, and he was not provided any of the underlying documents related to Plaintiff's attendance discipline and did not provide the documentation to the Committee. [Id. at 12-13]. Plaintiff argues that, most importantly, R.C. Brown stated at the meeting that there was not really anything wrong with Plaintiff and that he was just playing a game, which Plaintiff argues is evidence of intent to interfere with Plaintiff's FMLA rights and retaliate against him for exercising those rights. [Id. at 13].
In reply, Defendant argues that, to the extent Plaintiff asserts that Defendant interfered with his FMLA rights dating back to July 2011, such a claim was not alleged in the complaint and thus should not be considered, and in any event, any such claims based on absences prior to two years before filing of the lawsuit are time-barred.13 [Doc. 67 at 10-11 (citing Barrett v. Ill. Dept. of Corr., 803 F.3d 893, 897 (7th Cir. 2001))].
With [*23]  regard to the five infractions leading up to Plaintiff's termination, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's argument that he submitted FMLA requests to the FMLA office as required by policy is conclusory and insufficient to defeat summary judgment. [Id. at 12]. Defendant reiterates its earlier argument that it does not have a copy of the FMLA request forms at issue for January 3 and 28, 2013 and Plaintiff did not make a copy of the requests, and as such, Plaintiff has failed to show that he followed the company's procedures for requesting leave. [Id.].
Defendant also reiterates its arguments that it did not terminate Plaintiff's employment to interfere with Plaintiff's right to take continuous FMLA leave as the record shows that his attendance infractions were referred to the ARC two weeks before he requested continuous FMLA for back surgery, and it is undisputed that none of the decisionmakers was aware that Plaintiff sought continuous FMLA leave. [Id. at 13].

b. Discussion
In order to state a claim for interference, the employee must show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled, Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1206-07, and "[t]he employee need not allege that his employer intended to deny the benefit—the [*24]  employer's motives are irrelevant." Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1293.
First, the Court notes that Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim is based entirely on his intermittent FMLA leave and he does not assert an interference claim based on his continuous FMLA leave. [See Doc. 59 at 4-14]. With regard to his intermittent FMLA leave, Plaintiff attacks each infraction and/or disciplinary action leading up to his termination as an interference claim, arguing that Defendant impermissibly considered FMLA-leave as a "negative factor" in its decision to terminate him. [See id. at 5-9]. Defendant argues that any infractions or disciplinary actions prior to November 5, 2012, two years prior to the date of filing the complaint, are barred by the statute of limitations. [Doc. 52-1 at 17 n.7; Doc. 67 at 10-11].
The FMLA provides that "an action may be brought under this section not later than 2 years after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought." 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1) (emphasis added). The FMLA extends the statute of limitations to three years if the violation is "willful." 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(2). Defendant argues that Plaintiff has abandoned his claim for liquidated damages and thus, cannot now argue that Defendant acted willfully [*25]  to extend the statute of limitations. [Doc. 67 at 2 n.2]. Plaintiff makes no mention of the statute of limitations or even an argument for what constitutes the "last event." [See Doc. 59 at 4-9]. Instead, Plaintiff argues that Defendant impermissibly considered FMLA-leave as a "negative factor" in its decision to terminate him. [Id. at 5-9]. Although Plaintiff did not cite to the regulation, the Court presumes Plaintiff is referencing 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c), which provides that "employers cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, promotions or disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA leave be counted under 'no fault' attendance policies."14
There is no dispute that the absences in question were used as a basis for the termination. Thus, the Court must first determine which absences, if any, are not barred by the statute of limitations and then, for those that fall within the limitations period, determine which, if any, of the absences were FMLA-covered and thus used as a negative factor in Plaintiff's termination.

i. Statute of Limitations
As stated above, the FMLA provides that "an action may be brought under this section not later than 2 years after the date of the [*26]  last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought," 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1) (emphasis added), and within three years if the violation is "willful," 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(2). Although Defendant recognizes that Plaintiff's complaint alleges that Defendant's actions were willful, [Doc. 52-1 at 17 n.7], Defendant argues that Plaintiff has abandoned his claim for liquidated damages under the FMLA and thus cannot argue that Defendant acted willfully, [Doc. 67 at 2 n.2].
The FMLA gives the Court discretion to award liquidated damages, in addition to compensatory damages and interest, except if the employer shows that the act or omission was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not a violation. 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii). The Court fails to see how one provision (§ 2617(c)(2)) is dependent upon the other (§ 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii)). First, the liquidated damages provision makes no reference to the statute of limitations. Second, the liquidated damages provision places the burden on the employer to show that it acted in good faith, and awarding liquidated damages is presumptive and not dependent upon any argument presented by the employee of willfulness; whereas the burden is on the employee to show that the [*27]  employer acted willfully to extend the statute of limitations. See id.; Cooper v. Fulton County, Ga, 458 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir. 2006) (placing burden of showing good faith on employer); Liu v. Univ. of Miami, 138 F. Supp. 3d 1360, 1374 (S.D. Fla. 2015) (placing burden of showing that employer acted willfully on employee).
Third, Defendant cites to Rodriguez v. Farm Stores Grocery, Inc., 518 F.3d 1259, 1274 (11th Cir. 2008), for the proposition that "the absence of willfulness is equivalent to the presence of good faith." However, good faith is only half of the burden. Even if the court finds that the employer acted in good faith, the court does not abuse its discretion by awarding liquidated damages if the court also finds that the employer did not present reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not unlawful. Cooper, 458 F.3d at 1287. Thus, if an employer acts unreasonably to the point where the action is reckless, that is sufficient to show willfulness. Cf. McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U.S. 128, 135 n.13, 108 S. Ct. 1677, 100 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1988) ("If an employer acts reasonably in determining its legal obligation, its action cannot be deemed willful . . . . If an employer acts unreasonably, but not recklessly, in determining its legal obligation, then . . . it should not be [considered willful]."); see also id. at 133 (finding that the term "willful" under the FLSA means that "the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited [*28]  by statute").15 Finally, while difficult, it may be possible for an employer to demonstrate good faith even if the employer is found to have committed an intentional violation. See Hite v. Vermeer Mfg. Co., 446 F.3d 858, 869 (8th Cir. 2006) ("Showing good faith when a jury has determined intentional retaliation is a very high bar to clear, if it indeed can be."). Therefore, although Plaintiff did not directly respond to Defendant's liquidated damages argument, the Court finds that this argument is not grounds to conclude that Plaintiff abandoned his argument that Defendant acted willfully.
Moreover, Plaintiff's response suggests, just barely, that he has not abandoned his argument, as Plaintiff suggests that certain people acted with discriminatory intent and that the ARC is a cat's paw. [See Doc. 59 at 6-7, 12-14]. Accordingly, the Court will examine whether Plaintiff's absences are covered under either the two-year or three-year statute of limitations.

aa) Two-Year Statute of Limitations
There is little case law addressing the issue of a termination in an FMLA case that occurs inside the statute of limitations where the underlying unexcused absence, and denied leave, occurred outside of the limitations period. Defendant cites [*29]  to Barrett v. Ill. Dept. of Corrections, 803 F.3d 893 (7th Cir. 2015), and Reed v. Lear Corp., 556 F.3d 674 (8th Cir. 2009), in support of its arguments that this Court should not consider absences prior to November 5, 2012. Reed held that "[a]n FMLA violation occurs when an employer improperly denies a request for leave," and thus the statute of limitations is triggered when the leave is denied. Reed, 556 F.3d at 681-82.
The facts in Barrett are similar to this case. There, the defendant-employer had a progressive disciplinary policy concerning repeat unauthorized absences; discipline ranged from an oral reprimand to suspensions of increasing duration and, after ten unauthorized absences, termination. Barrett, 803 F.3d at 894. The plaintiff challenged her first, fifth and sixth unauthorized absences as qualifying for FMLA, which occurred between 2003 and 2005, however, each time she was denied FMLA coverage for those absences. Id. at 894-95. On the plaintiff's fifth and sixth unauthorized absences, she received a three-day and five-day "paper suspension," respectively, meaning that she still reported for work and suffered no lost wages. Id. at 895. She did not challenge any other absence. Id. Plaintiff's eighth unauthorized absence occurred two years after the sixth suspension, in 2007, and Plaintiff was then suspended for three days and lost wages. Id. Plaintiff's [*30]  twelfth unauthorized absence occurred in May 2010; she was suspended without pay in September 2010 for excessive absenteeism; and she was terminated in October 2010. Id. In her January 2012 complaint, Barrett urged the court to find that the limitations period began to run when her employment was terminated. Id.
The Seventh Circuit recognized that, in an FMLA interference claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate prejudice, and concluded that Barrett was harmed by the classification of her absence as unauthorized. Id. at 897 (citing Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 90, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002), for the proposition that the plaintiff must demonstrate prejudice). Thus, the court held, for purposes of the statute of limitations that "the employer's denial of the employee's request for leave is the 'last event constituting the alleged violation' on which the action is based." Id. (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1)). In reaching this conclusion, the Seventh Circuit distinguished the FMLA from Title VII, concluding that, unlike Title VII, there is no requirement of a "materially adverse employment action" and all that is required under Ragsdale is that the Plaintiff show some impairment of his rights and resulting prejudice. Id. at 898. Barrett concluded therefore that the FMLA did not have an open-ended [*31]  tolling rule. Id. at 899.
The Barrett decision conflicts with Butler v. Owens-Brockway Plastic Prods., Inc., 199 F.3d 314 (6th Cir. 1999).16 Under similar facts as the present case and in Barrett,17 the "defendant-[employer] argued that the termination must be time-barred if the other claims based upon its previous decisions to post the absences to plaintiff's record are time-barred, because plaintiff's termination claim is built upon the assessment of those [absences] and the two claims cannot be separated." Id. at 317. However, the Sixth Circuit disagreed finding that
[p]laintiff's termination was the first material adverse action in this case, because it was the first action serious enough to warrant plaintiff's resort to the legal system. To hold otherwise would force plaintiffs to bring suit each time they are assessed a negative mark on their absentee record, but before this mark results in probation, termination, failure to reinstate, or other adverse action. . . . [S]uch a requirement would unnecessarily clog the federal courts with premature claims.
Id.
While these conflicting cases are somewhat instructive, neither discussed the federal regulation providing that "employers cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions . [*32]  . . ." 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c). Two cases discuss the relevant regulation in their analysis of the statute of limitations: Charnley v. Boeing Co., No. C08-0130RSL, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8309, 2009 WL 279030 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 5, 2009), and Beekman v. Nestle Purina Petcare Co., 635 F. Supp. 2d 893, 906-908 (N.D. Iowa 2009). In Beekman, the plaintiff argued that the denial of her FMLA leave was not ripe until her termination, citing to § 825.220 as support. Id. at 906. However, the Beekman court relied on Reed in holding that her "claim was clearly ripe once the Company informed Beekman that it was denying her request for leave." Id.18
In Charnley, the plaintiff argued that there were two absences in August and September 2004, respectively, that should have been designated as FMLA leave. Charnley, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8309, 2009 WL 279030 at * 1. Like Plaintiff here, Charnley argued that she would not have been terminated in February 2006 for excessive absences if these absences were properly designated as FMLA leave. Id. The Charnley court noted that prior to termination, however, Plaintiff received a one-day suspension without pay and chose not to pursue legal action related to the determination. Id. The court held that "Boeing was therefore entitled to treat the characterization of those two absences as lawful and final when the two-year limitations period expired." Id. (citing United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 558, 97 S. Ct. 1885, 52 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1977)). The Charnley [*33]  plaintiff also argued that her termination was the "last action" constituting a violation and her claim did not become ripe until then because it was then that Boeing considered the FMLA absences as a "negative factor" in its employment decisions. Id. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8309, [WL] at *2. The court disagreed, holding that the fall 2004 absences had already generated an adverse employment action — the one day suspension without pay — and thus the statute of limitations began to run in 2004. Id.
The Court finds that Butler and Charnley are most consistent with Eleventh Circuit precedent, namely that an FMLA claim is not ripe until some materially adverse action occurs, such as loss of pay or termination, and not merely a denial of FMLA leave. See Floyd v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 274 Fed. Appx. 763, 765 (11th Cir. Apr. 17, 2008) (granting summary judgment to defendant-employer where the plaintiff was unable to demonstrate loss of income or incurred costs); Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 1999) (finding that the plaintiff "failed to demonstrate that she suffered any 'adverse employment action' for purposes of stating a prima facie case under the FMLA" and, additionally, that she did not suffer any repercussions from the failure to classify her absences as FMLA leave); Demers v. Adams Homes of Nw. Fla., Inc., 321 Fed. Appx. 847, 849 (11th Cir. Mar. 20, 2009) (holding that summary judgment was appropriate where defendant violated FMLA [*34]  by denying leave, but plaintiff could not articulate any harm suffered from such denial) (citing Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89).
Consistent with Butler, Plaintiff's claims became ripe when he was issued an EPN-plus-suspension on March 5, 2012.19 It was at this point that Plaintiff's absences resulted in disciplinary action that prejudiced him. Because Plaintiff was prejudiced by the failure to designate his absences as FMLA-covered leading up to being given an EPN-plus-suspension, Plaintiff's failure to timely sue on those denials within two years of the suspension renders those absences as not FMLA-covered for purposes of § 825.220(c), and, for purposes of this action, Defendant was entitled to treat those absences as unauthorized in considering whether he should be terminated. See Charnley, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8309, 2012 WL 279030 at *2; see also United Air Lines, Inc., 431 U.S. at 558 (holding that "United was entitled to treat the past act as lawful after respondent failed to file a charge of discrimination [within the statutory period]").
Because the EPN-plus-suspension occurred within three years of the filing of the lawsuit, the Court will now consider whether Plaintiff's claims are saved by the three-year statute of limitations.

bb) Three-Year Statute of Limitations
The Court concludes that Plaintiff has not demonstrated [*35]  a material fact question as to willfulness. As stated above, the Supreme Court has defined "willfulness" to mean "the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by statute." McLaughlin, 486 U.S. at 133. Plaintiff argues that Defendant often failed to code his leave as FMLA-covered. [Doc. 59 at 12]. Plaintiff suggests that the failure to code his absences as FMLA-covered were intentional, arguing that the ARC is a cat's paw. The "'[c]at's paw' theory of liability, also referred to as 'subordinate bias theory,' is liability seeking to hold an employer liable for the animus of a supervisor who was not charged with making the ultimate employment decision." Sims v. MVM, Inc., 704 F.3d 1327, 1335 n.6 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing Staub v. Proctor Hosp., 562 U.S. 411, 415, 131 S. Ct. 1186, 179 L. Ed. 2d 144 (2011)). In other words:
Under a cat's paw theory of causation, a non-decisionmaking employee's discriminatory animus may be imputed to a neutral decisionmaker when the decisionmaker has not independently investigated the allegations of misconduct. "In such a case, the recommender is using the decisionmaker as a mere conduit, or 'cat's paw' to give effect to the recommender's discriminatory animus." Under a cat's paw theory, a plaintiff must "prove that the discriminatory animus behind the recommendation, [*36]  and not the underlying employee misconduct identified in the recommendation, was an actual cause of the other party's decision to terminate the employee."
Corzine v. Little League Baseball, Inc., 9 F. Supp. 3d 1364, 1372 (M.D. Ga. 2014) (footnotes omitted) (quoting Stimpson v. City of Tuscaloosa, 186 F.3d 1328, 1331-32 (11th Cir. 1999)). However, Plaintiff fails to identify a single person, much less cite to any evidence, who had a discriminatory animus towards him. While Plaintiff argues that Stell and the ARC did not perform an investigation to determine whether the prior discipline was warranted, Plaintiff does not argue that Stell or any other non-decisionmaker, including Sharon Cline, had a discriminatory animus towards him. Only the FMLA office, and not Plaintiff's supervisors, was able to approve Plaintiff's leave as FMLA. (See Def. SOF ¶ 67; Pl. Resp. ¶ 67). Although Plaintiff's supervisors were not involved in the ARC meeting, Plaintiff also does not argue that his supervisors had any discriminatory animus.20 Moreover, Plaintiff's union representative had an opportunity to inform the Committee of any mitigating circumstances and thus had the opportunity to challenge the underlying disciplinary actions. (Def. SOF ¶ 18; Pl. Resp. ¶ 18); [Doc. 50-1 at 25-26].
Plaintiff also argues that R.C. Brown, a decisionmaker with the ARC, [*37]  stated at the meeting that there was not really anything wrong with Plaintiff and he was just playing a game and argues that this is evidence of intent and supports his cat's paw theory. [Id. at 13]; (Pl. SOF ¶ 122). Plaintiff cites to the depositions of Stell, Brown, as well as his own in support. (Pl. SOF ¶ 122 (citing Deposition of Lynn H. Stell, [Doc. 65], ("Stell Dep.") at 35; Deposition of R.C. Brown III, [Doc. 61], ("Brown Dep.") at 44; and Deposition of Marshal Jacobs, [Doc. 50], ("Jacobs Dep.")21 at 52-53)). However, neither Stell nor Brown's depositions support that this is what Brown said at the meeting, (Stell Dep. at 35; Brown Dep. at 44), and Plaintiff's deposition indicates that he was not present at the meeting, but heard the information from union representative James Butler, (Jacob's Dep. at 52-53). Plaintiff does not provide an affidavit from Butler, and thus the alleged statement made by Brown is excludable as hearsay. Inadmissible hearsay cannot be considered in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Macuba v. Deboer, 193 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir. 1999).
As such, Plaintiff has not established that the ARC was a cat's paw for discrimination or that Defendant's conduct was reckless, intentional, or anything more than mere negligence. [*38]  See McLaughlin, 486 U.S. at 133. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not presented a genuine issue of material fact to show that Defendant's conduct was willful to extend the statute of limitations to three years. As a result, the Court will only review infractions and disciplinary actions that occurred after the EPNplus-suspension, i.e., after March 5, 2012.

ii. Infractions since March 5, 2012
Because the next employment disciplinary action that prejudiced Plaintiff was the termination, the Court will consider all infractions Plaintiff received since he was given the EPN-plus-suspension: i.e, August 22, 2012, December 17, 2012, January 3, 2013, January 24, 2013, and January 28, 2013.
First, Plaintiff does not contend that the August 22, 2012 infraction was for an absence that should have been classified as FMLA leave. Instead, he argues that the infraction was for a tardy which should have been coded as a "free tardy." [Doc. 59 at 9]. This argument is, of course, based on the argument that the infractions leading up to the EPN-plus-suspension were FMLA-covered and he should not have had attendance violations on his record. However, as discussed above, Plaintiff failed to challenge the denial of FMLA [*39]  pertaining to absences within the statute of limitations and, therefore, those absences were not FMLA-covered and were properly classified as unauthorized.
Further, even if Plaintiff had timely challenged the denial of FMLA for those absences and they were determined to be FMLA-covered, Plaintiff's argument still fails. The record indicates that Plaintiff was tardy 2.9 hours. [Doc. 50-6 at 5]. Under the Attendance Standards, an employee is entitled to a free tardy if the tardy is up to one hour and the employee has no disciplinary action on his record. [Doc. 50-1 at 23]. As Plaintiff's tardy exceeded one hour, Plaintiff still would have received the infraction even if he did not have disciplinary action on his record. As Plaintiff does not argue that the August 22, 2012 infraction was FMLA-covered leave, the Court concludes that there was no interference with his FMLA rights pertaining to this absence.
Plaintiff's next infraction occurred on December 17, 2012, as to which Plaintiff argues that he was out sick, but he does not argue that it should have been FMLAcovered or even that he submitted the paperwork to get it coded as FMLA-leave. [See Doc. 59 at 9]. As a result, there is no issue [*40]  of material fact as to whether this absence amounted to FMLA interference.
Plaintiff contends that the January 3, 24, and 28, 2013 infractions should have been FMLA-covered and that he was improperly denied leave. [Id. at 9-10]. Plaintiff argues that he submitted FMLA request forms for January 3 and 28, but does not argue that he submitted an FMLA request form for January 24. [See id.]. Instead, he argues that his FMLA had expired on or before January 24 and that he recertified his FMLA on January 28, and then argues that Defendant should have retroactively coded the January 24 absence as FMLA. [Id.]; (Pl. Resp. ¶ 83).
Regarding the January 3 and 28 infractions, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot show that he was entitled to FMLA-leave on those days because he cannot show that he complied with Defendant's FMLA policy to submit a request form. [Doc. 52-1 at 18]. "When the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances. . . . If an employee does not comply with the employer's usual notice and procedural requirements, and no unusual circumstances justify the [*41]  failure to comply, FMLA-protected leave may be delayed or denied." 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(c). Plaintiff argues that he complied with Defendant's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements by submitting FMLA request forms for January 3 and 28. Despite that there are FMLA request forms submitted by Plaintiff for previous absences, [see e.g. Doc. 65-1 at 37, 38, 42, 43, 49, 51], there are no FMLA requests for January 3 and 28 in the record and Plaintiff does not point to any. Plaintiff argues that he did not keep a copy of the forms because standard procedure was just to complete the form in the FMLA office and put it in the dropbox and there was no copy machine. [Doc. 59 at 11-12].22
Although Plaintiff does not point to any evidence other than his own testimony that he submitted FMLA requests, in viewing factual disputes in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the nonmovant, the Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff submitted the FMLA request forms for January 3 and 28. Defendant asks this Court to ignore Plaintiff's testimony as conclusory and uncorroborated, however, the Court declines. As the Eleventh Circuit remarked in Newsome v. Chatham Cty. Det. Ctr., 256 Fed. Appx. 342 (11th Cir. Nov. 29, 2007),
While it is true that Newsome's [*42]  medical records do not support the version of the facts he presents in his affidavit, all this means is that there is conflict in the evidence, which we must resolve at the summary judgment stage in Newsome's favor. A jury may well find Newsome's account of the facts not to be credible. However, for purposes of summary judgment, there is nothing inherently wrong with "self-serving testimony," and it may not be disregarded by the district court in determining whether there is a genuine dispute of fact on a material issue in the case. "Courts routinely and properly deny summary judgment on the basis of a party's sworn testimony though it is self-serving." Price v. Time, Inc., 416 F.3d 1327, 1345 (11th Cir. 2005).
Id. at 346; see also Liebman v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 808 F.3d 1294, 1299 (11th Cir. 2015) ("[E]ven if a party's statements 'are self-serving, . . . that alone does not permit us to disregard them at the summary judgment stage.") (quoting Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, 707 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir. 2013); Equity Inv. Partners, LP v. Lenz, 594 F.3d 1338, 1345 (11th Cir. 2010) ("While the statements may be 'self-serving' and may not be 'objective evidence,' they are evidence nonetheless."). Here, this is a classic case of he-said-she-said since Plaintiff states that he submitted the FMLA request forms and Defendant produces an affidavit from Cline that states that she does not possess any such request forms. (See Jacobs Dep. at 102-05; Declaration [*43]  of Sharon Cline, [Doc. 52-10], ("Cline Decl.") ¶ 11). The Court is aware that "[w]hen opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment," Scott, 550 U.S. at 380; however, if the record does not blatantly contradict the nonmovant's version of events, the court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also EPL Inc., 173 F.3d at 1362; Duke, 884 F. Supp. at 514. Where the record presents disputed issues of material fact, the Court may not decide them; rather, it must deny the motion and proceed to trial. FindWhat Inv. Grp., 658 F.3d at 1307. The Court finds that Defendant has not presented evidence that moderately, much less blatantly, contradicts Plaintiff's version of events. Further, this fact is material because if the jury finds that Plaintiff submitted the request forms, then it could conclude that Plaintiff complied with Defendant's usual and customary procedures and requirements for obtaining FMLA leave and, therefore, could ultimately find that Defendant used Plaintiff's FMLA leave as a negative factor in its [*44]  termination, thus interfering with Plaintiff's right to take FMLA leave.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim be DENIED as it relates to Plaintiff's absences occurring on January 3 and 28, 2013.
With regard to the January 24 infraction, not only has Plaintiff failed to argue that he submitted an FMLA request form for that date, but he has not pointed to any evidence, other than his own testimony, to support that Defendant could have or was required to retroactively apply his FMLA after he recertified on January 28. Even looking at his own testimony, none of his cited testimony supports that he was told, or even believed, that once he recertified on January 28, his FMLA leave would be retroactively applied to the January 24 absence; it only shows that he testified that he simply recertified on January 28. (See Pl. SOF. ¶ 102 (citing Jacob's Dep. at 107-08, 138-39, 231-32)). Plaintiff argues that he spoke with Stell regarding his absences not being properly coded while going through the recertification process; however, the cited evidence does not support this argument either. [Doc. 59 at 12 (citing [*45]  Pl. SOF ¶ 54 (citing Jacobs Dep. at 65-66))].
Even if Plaintiff's testimony had provided that the recertification would apply retroactively, Plaintiff's testimony was not based on personal knowledge and thus the Court is not required to accept these bare and self-serving allegations. See Stewart v. Booker T. Washington Ins., 232 F.3d 844, 851 (11th Cir. 2000); Aristyld v. City of Lauderhill, 543 Fed. Appx. 905, 907 (11th Cir. Oct. 23, 2013). Plaintiff does not cite to any Lockheed policy that establishes retroactivity under these circumstances, nor has he produced evidence that establishes that Lockheed has retroactively applied FMLA leave in the past after recertification.
Accordingly, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has failed to present a genuine issue of material fact as to his absences on August 22, 2012, December 17, 2012, and January 24, 2013, and therefore RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim for those absences.

2. FMLA Retaliation Claim
"To state a claim [for retaliation] under the FMLA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) [he] availed [himself] of a protected right; (2) [he] suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment decision." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Cmtys., Inc., 666 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2012) (defining elements of  [*46] prima facie case for FMLA retaliation as: "(1) [he] engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) [he] suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) the decision was casually related to a protected activity.") (quoting Walker v. Elmore Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 379 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir. 2004)). The plaintiff must also prove that the employer acted with the requisite intent to retaliate. See Cross v. Sw. Recreational Indus., Inc., 17 F. Supp. 2d 1362, 1369 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (Murphy, J); see also Russell v. N. Broward Hosp., 346 F.3d 1335, 1340 (11th Cir. 2003) (noting that "with a retaliation claim the employee 'faces the increased burden of showing that his employer's actions were motivated by an impermissible retaliatory or discriminatory animus'") (quoting Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1206-07).23
A plaintiff may prove her FMLA retaliation prima facie case using direct evidence or circumstantial evidence. Cross, 17 F. Supp. 2d at 1371. "Direct evidence is 'evidence, that, if believed, proves the existence of a fact without inference or presumption.'" Morris v. Emory Clinic, Inc., 402 F.3d 1076, 1081 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1086 (11th Cir. 2004)). "Such evidence must demonstrate the existence of 'a discriminatory . . . attitude correlating to the discrimination . . . complained of by the employee.'" Darring v. DailyAccess Corp., No. Civ. 05-112-BH-M, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17326, 2006 WL 779868, at *10 (S.D. Ala. Mar. 27, 2006) (quoting Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets Of Florida, Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1358 (11th Cir. 1999)). "If the Court finds that the alleged statement merely 'suggests, but does not prove, a discriminatory motive, then it is circumstantial evidence.'" Darring, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17326, 2006 WL 779868 at *10 (quoting Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1086).
In the absence of direct evidence [*47]  of the employer's intent, courts evaluate FMLA retaliation claims under the McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting framework. Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236, 1243 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1972)). Under the McDonnell-Douglas framework, if the plaintiff satisfies his prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action taken, and then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that this reason was merely a pretext for discrimination. Schaaf, 602 F.3d at 1243-44. To satisfy this burden, the plaintiff "must present evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision." Id. at 1244 (internal quotation marks omitted).

a. Prima Facie Case
To establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, a plaintiff must present evidence that: "(1) he engaged in statutorily protected conduct; (2) he was adversely affected by an employment decision; and (3) there was a causal connection between the statutorily protected conduct and the adverse employment decision." Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1307 (11th Cir. 2006). To establish the causation element, a plaintiff must show: (1) close temporal proximity between the statutorily protected activity and the adverse employment [*48]  action; and (2) the decisionmaker knew that the plaintiff engaged in statutorily protected activity. See Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1298. This element can be satisfied if the plaintiff can show "'that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.'" Brungart, 231 F.3d at 799 (quoting Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir. 1999)).
Defendant argues that although Plaintiff claims retaliation for requesting continuous FMLA leave for his back surgery, summary judgment is appropriate because Plaintiff cannot establish a causal connection between that request and his termination since none of the decisionmakers knew of Plaintiff's request to take continuous FMLA at the time the decision was made to terminate Plaintiff and his attendance infractions were referred to the ARC weeks before Plaintiff requested continuous FMLA. [Doc. 52-1 at 22-23]. Thus, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's request for continuous FMLA leave and his termination were wholly unrelated. [Id.].
Plaintiff counters that he has established a prima facie case as he was on intermittent FMLA leave, he was disciplined upon return from leave in July 2011, October 2011, and March 2012, and was terminated while on FMLA leave in February 2013. [Doc. 59 at 14-15]. Plaintiff argues that the leave and the termination [*49]  are not wholly unrelated because "the decision makers with respect to his discipline that led to his termination, Ansley and Tonkin, were aware of the protected conduct at or around the time of the adverse employment action." [Doc. 59 at 16]. Plaintiff argues that Tonkin was aware that Plaintiff had back problems, Ansley and Tonkin received reports that Plaintiff was using FMLA, and the ARC also received documents showing Plaintiff was exercising rights under the FMLA. [Id.].
In reply, Defendant reiterates its argument that none of the decisionmakers knew that Plaintiff requested continuous FMLA leave for back surgery at the time of his termination. [Doc. 67 at 14]. Although they knew of Plaintiff's past FMLA leave, Defendant argues that this is not enough to raise a fact issue as to causal link. [Id. at 15]. Defendant also argues that the ARC relied on information provided by Cline that Plaintiff's attendance infractions were not covered by the FMLA. [Id. at 14]. Defendant points out that Plaintiff does not allege that Cline had any retaliatory animus toward Plaintiff. [Id.].
To the extent Plaintiff asserts a retaliation claim with respect to the disciplinary actions up to and including the EPN-plus-suspension, [*50]  the Court finds that those claims are barred by the statute of limitations for the reasons set forth in section III.A.1.b.i, supra.
Next, Plaintiff fails to establish a prima facie case with respect to his request for continuous FMLA leave. Plaintiff's attendance infractions were recommended to the ARC for termination on or before February 7, 2013. (See Def. SOF ¶¶ 52, 53; Pl. Resp. ¶¶ 52, 53). Plaintiff did not inform anyone that he needed to take continuous FMLA leave until February 20, 2013 and, even then, only informed his supervisors, Campbell and Tonkin. (Def. SOF ¶ 85; Pl. Resp. ¶ 85; Pl. SOF ¶ 68). Plaintiff admits that the ARC was unaware that Plaintiff had requested continuous FMLA leave at the time of his termination on February 22, 2013. [Doc. 59 at 16 n.3]. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to establish a causal link between his request for continuous FMLA and his termination. See Brungart, 231 F.3d at 799 ("[T]emporal proximity alone is insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to causal connection where there is unrebutted evidence that the decision maker did not have knowledge that the employee engaged in protected conduct."); Rudy v. Walter Coke, Inc., 613 Fed. Appx. 828, 830-31 (11th Cir. June 2, 2015) (summary judgment proper where employee told his supervisor [*51]  about needed surgery but there was no evidence that either general manager or company vice president—the decisionmakers—knew he needed surgery or had requested leave).
On the other hand, Plaintiff has demonstrated a prima facie case with respect to his intermittent FMLA leave. Plaintiff argues that the members of the ARC received documents showing that Plaintiff was exercising his rights under the FMLA. [Doc. 59 at 16]. Although his citation is unsupported, there is evidence in the record to suggest, and Defendant concedes, that the ARC did have documentation and was aware of Plaintiff's intermittent FMLA use. See, e.g., Declaration of Rene Letourneau, [Doc. 52-7], ¶ 7; [Doc. 52-7 at 8-9; Doc. 67 at 15]. It is undisputed that Plaintiff recertified his FMLA on January 28, 2013 and his employment was recommended for termination shortly thereafter. Accordingly, Plaintiff has shown that the termination was not wholly unrelated to his FMLA use and has therefore established a prima facie case.

b. Legitimate, Non-retaliatory Reason and Pretext
Defendant argues that it has provided a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the termination: namely that Plaintiff violated the Company's Attendance [*52]  Standards as he had unexcused absences and tardies that were not FMLA-covered. [See Doc. 52-1 at 24]. Plaintiff argues that Defendant has not established a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason because Defendant used FMLA-covered leave as a negative factor in disciplining and terminating Plaintiff. [Doc. 59 at 16-17]. Plaintiff argues that he has established pretext by relying on his previous arguments that he would not have been terminated if he had not received the verbal warning in violation of the FMLA and that R.C. Brown stated at the ARC meeting that there was not anything really wrong with Plaintiff. [Id. at 17-18]. Plaintiff also argues that Tonkin stated during his deposition that he would be willing to reinstate Plaintiff only with conditions related to his attendance. [Id. at 18]. In reply, Defendant simply argues that Plaintiff has failed to establish pretext and argues that he cannot establish a cat's paw theory here either. [Doc. 67 at 15 & n.11].
As discussed above, Plaintiff's FMLA claims against Defendant for the disciplinary actions it took up to and including the EPN-plus-suspension are time barred. And, even assuming that a jury could find that Plaintiff submitted the proper FMLA forms [*53]  and Lockheed failed to code the January 3 and 28 absences as FMLAcovered, Plaintiff has still failed to create a genuine issue regarding the requisite intent to retaliate. Defendant argues that "the ARC relied in good faith on the confirmation from Sharon Cline . . . that none of the attendance infractions upon which Plaintiff's termination was based were FMLA-approved." [Doc. 67 at 4]. Plaintiff has not produced admissible evidence to dispute these facts, and thus the Court agrees with Lockheed and concludes that this is fatal to Plaintiff's pretext argument. See E.E .O.C. v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 221 F.3d 1171, 1176 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that employer's good faith belief that employee had lied in an internal investigation constituted a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for terminating employee regardless of whether employee had actually engaged in misconduct); Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir. 1991) (explaining that "if the employer fired an employee because it honestly believed that the employee had violated a company policy, even if it was mistaken in such belief, the discharge is not 'because of race'"). Plaintiff fails to present sufficient evidence that the ARC did not have a good faith reason to believe that Plaintiff violated the Attendance Standards. As discussed in section III.A.1.b.i.bb., [*54]  supra, Plaintiff has not presented sufficient admissible evidence demonstrating that the ARC was a "cat's paw" or of R.C. Brown's alleged statements at the hearing. Moreover, Tonkin's statement that "he would be willing to reinstate Mr. Jacobs but only with conditions related to his attendance," [Doc. 59 at 18], is irrelevant as Tonkin was not a decisionmaker, did not make determinations pertaining to approval of Plaintiff's FMLA requests, and Plaintiff failed to present evidence that Tonkin influenced the decisions in either process. Accordingly, to the extent that Plaintiff asserts a cat's paw-theory in support of his pretext argument, this argument fails and Plaintiff has failed to establish pretext.
In sum, although Plaintiff's deposition testimony is sufficient evidence to create a triable issue as to whether Defendant interfered with his entitlement to FMLA leave, it is not, by itself, sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to his FMLA retaliation claim as Plaintiff has not demonstrated intent to retaliate. Cf. Beekman, 635 F. Supp. 2d at 918 (finding that, in addition to the fact that Beekman created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Nestle mistakenly failed to apply FMLA leave [*55]  to unexcused absences, there was also evidence of pretext where Nestle admitted to making a mistake as to at least one of the absences and the mistake was an "obvious error"); Norman v. S. Guar. Ins. Co., 191 F. Supp. 2d 1321, 1333 (finding additional reasons of retaliatory intent apart from finding that it was unclear whether Norman violated the absentee policy).
As such, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment of Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim be GRANTED.

B. ADA
The ADA prohibits covered entities from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). "[T]here are two distinct categories of disability discrimination claims under the ADA: (1) failure to accommodate and (2) disparate treatment." E.E.O.C. v. Eckerd Corp., Civil Action No. 1:10-cv-2816-JEC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91370, 2012 WL 2726766, at *4 (N.D. Ga. July 9, 2012) (Carnes, J.). The ADA also prohibits retaliation against an individual "because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful [under the ADA] or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner [*56]  in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a).

1. Disparate Treatment
With respect to ADA disparate-treatment claims, the Court uses the McDonnell-Douglas framework discussed above. Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007). Thus, if Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to Defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, and finally, if such reason is sufficiently articulated, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to show pretext. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004).

a) Prima Facie Case
"In order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, [the plaintiff] must demonstrate that [he] (1) is disabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of [his] disability. Morales v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., Div. of Family & Children Servs., 446 Fed. Appx. 179, 182 (11th Cir. Nov. 2, 2011).
Defendant challenges the second and third elements, arguing that Plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" and that he cannot show that his employment was terminated because of his disabilities. [Doc. 52-1 at 11-12]. Defendant argues that regular and predictable attendance was an essential function of his job and "Plaintiff's unscheduled, unpredictable, and cumulatively substantial absences rendered him unable to work and perform his duties." [*57]  [Id. at 11]. Defendant further argues that there is no evidence that it terminated him because of his alleged disabilities because none of the decisionmakers were aware that Plaintiff had an alleged disability. [Id. at 12].
In response, Plaintiff argues that regular attendance was not an essential function of Plaintiff's job, and if it was, "he met this requirement since the vast majority of his absences were federally protected." [Doc. 59 at 20]. Plaintiff argues that, although attendance is important in any job, "it was not as important for the Inspectors because they routinely covered for each other when someone was absent, and attendance is not listed as an essential function . . . in the job description." [Id. at 21]. Plaintiff argues that his absence never caused Defendant to miss any deadlines or interfered with contract compliance. [Id.]. Plaintiff also argues that the ARC knew that Plaintiff had requested an accommodation in the form of intermittent FMLA and thus knew of Plaintiff's disability. [Id. at 21-22].
In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff offered no personal knowledge to support his argument that regular attendance was not an essential function of his job and continues to argue that the ARC was not aware [*58]  that Plaintiff had an alleged disability or that he requested an accommodation for any such disability. [Doc. 67 at 3-4]. Defendant argues that the ARC relied in good faith on the information from Cline that none of the attendance infractions were FMLA-approved. [Id. at 4].
"The ADA defines a 'qualified individual' as an individual with a disability 'who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions' of [his] job. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)." Morales, 446 Fed. Appx. at 182. "[E]ssential functions are the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1257 (quotations and citations omitted). "Consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description . . ., this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). When considering the employer's judgment as to what is an essential function, courts also consider testimony from the plaintiff's supervisor. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1257. While the employer's judgment is given substantial weight, it is not conclusive and other factors may be considered such as (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, [*59]  (2) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function, (3) the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of past incumbents in the job, (5) the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs, (6) the reason the position exists, (7) whether there is a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of the job can be easily distributed; and (8) whether the position is highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position was hired for his expertise or ability to perform the particular function. See id. at 1258-59.
The Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff was qualified for the position. Defendant does not dispute that if Plaintiff submitted FMLA request forms for the days he was absent, he might not have been terminated for the absences in question leading up to the termination, i.e. the January 3 and 28 absences. Thus, the relevant inquiry for the jury is whether Plaintiff submitted the FMLA request forms for January 3 and 28 to demonstrate that he would not have been terminated but for the failure to properly code his absence as FMLAcovered.
Even if the FMLA request forms were [*60]  not at issue, the Court still finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff was qualified. Defendant asks this Court to solely rely on the affidavits of Plaintiff's supervisors, which provide that Plaintiff's "position required predictable attendance, as his inability to perform the job increased the workload of others and interfered with the Company's general contract compliance." (Declaration of Brett Tonkin, [Doc. 52-3], ("Tonkin Decl.") ¶ 3; Declaration of Steve Ansley, [Doc. 52-4], ("Ansley Decl.") ¶ 3; Declaration of Mark Campbell, [Doc. 52-5], ("Campbell Decl.") ¶ 3). No examples were provided by Defendant of how Plaintiff's absences increased the workload of others or interfered with the Company's contract compliance. In fact, Plaintiff produces his own affidavit which provides that attendance was not important for the Inspectors because they routinely covered for each other when someone was absent, he often covered for other Inspectors to meet deadlines and get the job done, and that his absences never caused Defendant to miss any deadlines or interfered with contract compliance. (Declaration of Marshal Jacobs, [Doc. 57-1], ("Jacobs Decl.") ¶¶ [*61]  20-22). The Court rejects Defendant's argument that Plaintiff has no personal knowledge as to whether regular attendance is an essential function of his job as he performed that job, and whether attendance is an essential function is a fact question for the jury to decide. Further, Lockheed presents no case law in support of its argument. Moreover, Plaintiff's job description does not provide that attendance is an essential function. [Doc. 50-1 at 15-18]. While the Attendance Standards, negotiated between the Union and the Company, does provide that "[r]egular attendance by each employee is essential to the operation of the Company's business and key to the financial well being of the individual employee," [Doc. 50-1 at 20], this is not specific enough to assert that attendance is an essential function of Plaintiff's particular job. Thus, the Court finds that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Plaintiff was qualified for the position. See Holly, 492 F.3d at 1260 ("[A]lthough Clairson makes the bare assertion that strict punctuality by mold polishers is important in order to keep production moving, the record contains virtually no evidence that Holly needed to work with others to complete [*62]  his work, that his tardiness ever caused production to slow down or caused any other detriment to Clairson, or that he ever failed to complete his molds on time.").
Defendant next argues that, even if Plaintiff were qualified, he still cannot establish a prima facie case because none of the decisionmakers knew that Plaintiff had an alleged disability and thus Plaintiff cannot show that he was terminated because of his disabilities. [Doc. 52-1 at 12]. However, as discussed above, the ARC was aware of Plaintiff's history of intermittent FMLA leave and Plaintiff was recommended for termination soon after recertifying his FMLA leave for his disability. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant's argument fails and Plaintiff has established a prima facie case for disparate treatment under the ADA.

b) Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason and Pretext
Moving through the McDonnell-Douglass paradigm, Defendant has presented a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination and Plaintiff has not presented evidence to show that Defendant's proffered reason was pretextual for intentional discrimination based on his disability. See Cleveland, 369 F.3d at 1193 (articulating that the plaintiff has "the ultimate burden [*63]  of proving that [the defendant] intentionally discriminated against [him] because of [his] disabilty"). As stated above, Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to show that the ARC did not have a good faith reason to rely on the information provided by Cline that Plaintiff's absences were not FMLA-covered and that Plaintiff violated the Company's attendance policy. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to presented sufficient evidence of discriminatory animus, and as such Plaintiff has failed to establish pretext.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion with regard to Plaintiff's ADA disparate treatment claim be GRANTED.

2. Failure to Accommodate
As for reasonable-accommodation claims, the Eleventh Circuit has stated:
An employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer fails to provide "reasonable accommodations" for the disability-unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a). An accommodation can qualify as "reasonable," and thus be required by the ADA, only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. See LaChance v. Duffy's Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1998). The plaintiff bears the burden of [*64]  identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job's essential functions. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997); Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 283 (11th Cir. 1997).
The ADA lists as examples of reasonable accommodations "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); see 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). As the list indicates, the ADA may require the employer to "reassign," i.e., transfer, the disabled employee to a vacant position as a reasonable accommodation. The reassignment duty, however, does not require the employer to bump another employee from a position in order to accommodate a disabled employee. See Willis, 108 F.3d at 284. Nor does it require the employer to promote a disabled employee. See EEOC v. Humiston-Keeling, Inc., 227 F.3d 1024, 1029 (7th Cir. 2000); Cravens v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 214 F.3d 1011, 1019 (8th Cir. 2000); Cassidy v. Detroit Edison Co., 138 F.3d 629, 634 (6th Cir. 1998); Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827, 832 (3d Cir. 1996); see also Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626 (11th Cir. 1998) (citing White v. York Int'l Corp., 45 F.3d 357, 362 (10th Cir. 1995)); 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App. § 1630.2(o) ("It should also be noted that an employer is not required to promote an individual with a disability as an accommodation.").
Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2001). Defendant's opening brief focuses on Plaintiff's request for continuous FMLA leave for back surgery, as opposed to his intermittent FMLA leave. [Doc. 52-1 at 14-15]. Defendant thus argues that, aside from the fact that Plaintiff is not [*65]  qualified, Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim fails because there is no evidence that the decisionmakers knew of his alleged disabilities at the time of the termination or that he requested an accommodation for one of those disabilities. [Id.].
Plaintiff responds that the intermittent and continuous FMLA requests were requests to accommodate and by denying his requests, Defendant failed to accommodate his disability. [Doc. 59 at 21-22]. Plaintiff argues that the requests were reasonable and Defendant cannot show that the requests would cause an undue hardship or were unduly burdensome. [Id. at 22-23].
In its reply, Defendant again argues that there is no evidence that Plaintiff requested continuous FMLA leave or any other leave related to his back. [Doc. 67 at 7-8]. Defendant argues that it routinely approved Plaintiff's intermittent FMLA leave and no adverse action was taken against him "except when the Company determined he had not complied with its customary and usual procedural requirements." [Id.]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to point to any evidence in the record that the decisionmakers knew that he had requested a reasonable accommodation and it is undisputed that no decisionmaker [*66]  knew of any request. [Id.]. Finally, Defendant argues that "Plaintiff should not be allowed to avail himself of the greater monetary relief available under the ADA based solely on the alleged denial of FMLA leave." [Id.].
To address Defendant's last point, the Court finds that Plaintiff is permitted to assert a reasonable accommodation claim under the ADA for failure to accommodate leave requests, whether it is under the FMLA or any other type of leave. See Norman, 191 F. Supp. 2d 1321, 1335; c.f. Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1313-14 (11th Cir. 2003) (holding that a leave of absence might be a reasonable accommodation in some cases, however a request for indefinite leave is unreasonable). The Court also determined in the previous section that a genuine issue of material fact arose as to whether Plaintiff was a qualified individual and that the decisionmakers were aware of his intermittent FMLA requests, thereby on notice that he was under a disability. Further, there is no dispute as to whether Plaintiff had a disability as defined under the ADA. Thus, the only thing to determine is whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant unlawfully denied Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation [*67]  to take leave.
To the extent that Plaintiff asserts a reasonable accommodation claim for failure to accommodate his request to take continuous FMLA leave, that claim fails because, as discussed above, it is undisputed that the decisionmakers did not know Plaintiff had requested continuous FMLA leave. However, for the reasons set forth for Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant denied him a reasonable accommodation to take leave on January 3 and January 28. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment with regard to Plaintiff's ADA claim for failure to accommodate be DENIED to the extent that it is based on Plaintiff's intermittent FMLA leave for January 3 and January 28, and GRANTED as to all other requests for leave, including continuous FMLA leave.

3. Retaliation
Like retaliation under the FMLA, ADA retaliation claims are assessed under the same framework as retaliation claims arising under Title VII. Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997). To establish a prima facie case for a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered a materially adverse action24 ; [*68]  and (3) there was a causal link between the two. Dixon v. The Hallmark Cos., Inc., 627 F.3d 849, 856 (11th Cir. 2010); see also Johnson v. Booker T. Washington Broad. Serv., Inc., 234 F.3d 501, 507 (11th Cir. 2000); Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1566 (11th Cir. 1997). To satisfy the causation prong, Plaintiff is only required to show that the "protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated." Shotz v. City of Plantation, 344 F.3d 1161, 1180, n.30 (11th Cir. 2003) ("[A] plaintiff satisfies this element if he provides sufficient evidence that the decision-maker became aware of the protected conduct, and that there was a close temporal proximity between this awareness and the adverse action.") (alteration and citation omitted). Under the McDonnell-Douglas framework, if the plaintiff satisfies his prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action taken, and then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that this reason was merely a pretext for discrimination. Schaaf, 602 F.3d at 1243-44.
As discussed in relation to Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim, section III.A.2., supra, Plaintiff has established a prima facie case by showing that, outside of the infractions, the ARC was aware that Plaintiff had taken intermittent FMLA leave; however, Defendant presented a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the termination — the infractions were not FMLA-covered [*69]  and thus, Plaintiff failed to comply with the Attendance Standards — and Plaintiff has failed to establish pretext. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim.

IV. Conclusion
For the reasons herein, the undersigned RECOMMENDS to the District Judge that he GRANT IN PART AND DENY IN PART Defendant's motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 52]. Specifically, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that summary judgment be DENIED as to Plaintiff FMLA interference claim as it pertains to the January 3, 2013 and January 28, 2013 absences and GRANTED on all other interference claims; GRANTED as to Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim; GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA disparate treatment claim; DENIED as to Plaintiff's ADA reasonable accommodation claim, but only as it pertains to the January 3, 2013 and January 28, 2013 requests for leave, and GRANTED on all other reasonable accommodation claims; and GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim.
As all matters referred to the undersigned under Standing Order 14-01 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 15, 2014), have been ruled upon by the undersigned, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the referral [*70]  to the undersigned Magistrate Judge.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED and DIRECTED, this the 13th day of July, 2016.
