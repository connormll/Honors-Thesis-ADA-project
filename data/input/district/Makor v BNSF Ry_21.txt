CIVIL MINUTES -- GENERAL
PROCEEDINGS: MINUTE ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (DOC. NO. 28) AND DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AS MOOT (DOC. NO. 30) (IN CHAMBERS)
Plaintiff Hilyale Makor ("Makor") took an extended period of leave from his job with Defendant BNSF Railway Company ("BNSF") when he suffered emotional distress upon learning he may have been exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus ("HIV").1 BNSF discharged Makor from its employ. In this lawsuit, the parties dispute whether BNSF acted lawfully in doing so.
On January 16, 2015, Makor [*2]  filed a motion for partial summary judgment ("PMSJ"). (Doc. No. 30.) That same day, BNSF filed a motion for summary judgment ("DMSJ"). (Doc. No. 28.)
The motions came before the Court for a hearing on February 23, 2015. After consideration of the papers filed in support of, and in opposition to, the motions, the Court GRANTS the DMSJ, and DENIES the PMSJ as MOOT.

I. UNDISPUTED FACTS2
To the extent certain facts, or conclusions, are not mentioned in this Order, the Court has not relied on them in reaching its decision. In addition to considering the evidentiary objections raised by the parties, the Court has independently considered the admissibility of the evidence underlying both parties' Statement of Undisputed Facts, and has not considered facts that are irrelevant or based upon inadmissible evidence. The following material facts are supported adequately by admissible evidence and are uncontroverted. They are "admitted to exist without controversy" for the purposes of this Motion. See L.R. 56-3.

A. Makor's Psychological Difficulties
BNSF operates a freight railroad network in the western United States. (BNSF's Amended Statement of Undisputed Facts ("DSUF") (Doc. No. 36)3 ¶ 1.) BNSF is an employer [*3]  subject to California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12940, et seq. (Makor's Statement of Undisputed Facts ("PSUF") (Doc. No. 30-6) ¶ 1.) BNSF hired Makor in 2011, and he became a Trainmaster on June 12, 2012. (DSUF ¶ 2.) As a Trainmaster, Makor was responsible for managing the train yard and employees, as well as planning train and switching operations. (DSUF ¶ 3.) In December 2011, Makor learned he might have been exposed to HIV. (PSUF ¶ 4; DSUF ¶ 5.) He became depressed, anxious, and fearful for his well-being. (PSUF ¶ 5.)
Makor continued to work for the next seven months, but on July 20, 2012, he sought treatment at Concentra Urgent Care and was diagnosed with "situational anxiety." (PSUF ¶ 20.) As a result of this diagnosis, the treating physician asked that he be excused from work for three days.4 (Id.) One of Makor's supervisors, John Clarke, received that doctor's note the same day. (DSUF ¶ 15.) Soon after, Clarke received a letter from Dr. Perry Guthrie, Ph.D. ("Dr. Guthrie"), dated July 24, 2012, placing Makor on a thirty day medical leave of absence from work; while the note also stated that Makor would be re-assessed at the end of this thirty day period, it did not provide a definite date for Makor to return to work. (PSUF ¶ 22; [*4]  DSUF ¶ 16.) On August 20, 2012, Dr. Guthrie wrote that Makor was not ready to return to work; again, while the note stated that Makor would be re-assessed on September 14, it did not provide a date certain for him to return to work. (PSUF ¶¶ 25-27; DSUF ¶ 17.) On September 6, 2012, Dr. Guthrie sent a letter to Bunny J. Wolfe, a MetLife STD Claim Specialist, regarding Makor's condition. (PSUF ¶ 28.) On October 22, 2012, Dr. Cuthbert W. Pyne, M.D. ("Dr. Pyne"), stated in a certificate that Makor was unable to work from October 15, 2012 to January 6, 2013 due to total incapacitation. (PSUF ¶ 29.) Dr. Pyne followed up the October 2012 certificate with another certificate on March 15, 2013 stating that Makor had been totally incapacitated from October 15, 2012 to March 16, 2013, but was sufficiently recovered to resume a normal workload without limitation on March 17, 2013. (PSUF ¶ 68).

B. The Short-Term Disability Plan
In addition to providing employees with FMLA leave in compliance with federal law, BNSF also provided employees with a Short-Term Disability ("STD") plan, which paid employees 100% of their salary for up to 177 days. (PSUF ¶ 11.) The plan is administered by MetLife, in conjunction [*5]  with the BNSF benefits team. (PSUF ¶¶ 17, 41; DSUF ¶ 19.) The plan provided benefits to the employee for a 177 day period "if an illness or injury leaves [him or her] disabled or unable to return to work." (PSUF ¶ 12.5 ) To receive benefits, employees must be absent for more than five days and must file a claim with MetLife.6 (DSUF ¶ 20.) The STD plan runs concurrently with an employee's benefits under the FMLA, which provides for twelve weeks of leave. (PSUF ¶ 57; DSUF ¶ 21.)
Under the BNSF STD policy, if an employee is not released to return to work after twelve weeks of disability: (1) BNSF may fill the employee's job; (2) if, upon the employee's return to work, their position has been filled, the employee must contact an HR representative to discuss job opportunities; (3) an employee has sixty days from the date that MetLife determines the employee is no longer disabled to secure a new position with BNSF; and (4) if after sixty days the employee is unable to find a position with BNSF, her or she will be terminated from BNSF service.7 (PSUF ¶¶ 36-37, 52-56; DSUF ¶ 22-23.) This sixty day period cannot be extended. (PSUF ¶ 56.)

C. Makor Exhausts his FMLA Leave and the Benefits Under the [*6]  STD Plan
MetLife determined that Makor qualified for STD leave beginning on July 20, 2012. (PSUF ¶ 31.) On October 17, 2012, Makor exhausted the twelve week leave period provided under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and BNSF began training his replacement. (PSUF ¶¶ 57, 59; DSUF ¶ 20.) Based on the documentation provided by Makor's healthcare providers, MetLife determined that Makor qualified for STD leave from July 20, 2012 to December 7, 2012. (PSUF ¶ 31.) On January 13, 2013, MetLife mailed a letter to Makor, informing him that his STD benefits had been terminated as of December 7, 2012. (PSUF ¶ 31.) Makor appealed that decision on February 6, 2013, requesting that his STD leave be extended to its maximum duration date of January 17, 2013; this appeal was denied on March 20, 2013. (DSUF ¶ 44.) As noted above, Makor was given sixty days to find a new position within BNSF, though this period did not include the time that MetLife was considering his appeal. (PSUF ¶¶ 71-72; DSUF ¶¶ 45-47.) Thus, Makor had until April 28, 2013 to find a new position within BNSF. (PSUF ¶ 82; DUSF ¶¶ 45-48.) Makor was informed of this during an in-person meeting with George Hill ("Hill"), BNSF's Human Resources Director for the California [*7]  Division, and via letter dated April 3, 2013. (DSUF ¶ 48.) Though Makor returned to work unannounced and attempted to work again as a Trainmaster, he no longer held that position; Hill told Makor that Makor would be required to apply for other openings within the company on the BNSF "eCareer" website, which contained job openings across the country. (PSUF ¶ 66; DSUF ¶¶ 49-51.) Makor did not begin to look for another position within BNSF until after this meeting with Hill.8 (DSUF ¶ 53.) Though Makor applied for open jobs within BNSF, he was not offered another position and his employment with BNSF ended on April 28, 2013 at the end of the sixty day period. (PSUF ¶¶ 80, 83; DSUF ¶¶ 63-65.)

D. BNSF's Accommodation Policies
As explained in more detail below, BNSF contends that Makor was not disabled as of March 17, 2013, and because he was no longer disabled, it did not have any obligation to make reasonable job accommodations for him. BNSF contends that the STD plan administered by MetLife is separate from its corporate policy regarding reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities. BNSF produced Heather Miller ("Miller"), BNSF's Director of Equal Employment Opportunity [*8]  and Affirmative Action Compliance, for a deposition in this action. During that deposition, Miller confirmed that (1) the STD policy is the only written policy regarding disability leave; (2) BNSF has no policy governing leave of absence for disability conditions beyond the STD policy and a long term disability policy; and (3) BNSF does not have a reasonable accommodation policy. (PSUF ¶¶ 48-51.)
In a later declaration, however, Miller states that BNSF policy provides that employees may request accommodation by submitting a one-page "Request for Accommodation" form that is available on BNSF's website.9 (DSUF ¶ 70.) This form is used in the interactive process to identify reasonable accommodations that may be granted to a disabled employee. (DSUF ¶ 71.) Moreover, though the STD policy states that an employee has sixty days from the date he or she is no longer disabled to find a new position within BNSF, there is no requirement that an employee must "voluntarily resign" after the sixty day unpaid leave of absence; employees may request an accommodation for a further leave of absence. (DSUF ¶¶ 73-75.) As Makor did not submit a Request for Accommodation, and because he had been released [*9]  to return to work without limitation, BNSF did not engage in the interactive process with him concerning a disability.10 (DSUF ¶ 77.)

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. The Complaint and Removal
Makor filed this action on March 4, 2014 in the California Superior Court for the County of San Bernardino. (Not. of Removal (Doc. No. 1) Ex. A ("Complaint").) BNSF removed the action to this Court on April 4, 2014. (Not. of Removal.) The Complaint alleges six claims against BNSF: (1) disability discrimination, in violation of California Government Code Section 12940(a); (2) retaliation, in violation of California Government Code Section 12940(h); (3) failure to take all steps necessary to stop discrimination and retaliation from occurring, in violation of California Government Code Section 12940(h); (4) failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, in violation of California Government Code Section 12940(m); (5) failure to engage in a timely good-faith interactive process concerning plaintiff's disability, in violation of California Government Code Section 12940(n); and (6) wrongful termination in violation of public policy.

B. Makor's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
On January 16, 2015, Makor filed the PMSJ, which seeks to have certain facts established as not genuinely in dispute in the case. Along with the PMSJ, Makor filed:

• a supplemental Declaration of Ronald W. Novotny (Doc. No. 45-1);
• Evidentiary Objections to the DMSJ Opp'n (Doc. No. 46).

III. LEGAL STANDARD
A motion for summary judgment shall be granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The moving party must show that "under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250.
Generally, the burden [*12]  is on the moving party to demonstrate that it is entitled to summary judgment. Margolis v. Ryan, 140 F.3d 850, 852 (9th Cir. 1998); Retail Clerks Union Local 648 v. Hub Pharmacy, Inc., 707 F.2d 1030, 1033 (9th Cir. 1983). The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying the elements of the claim or defense and evidence that it believes demonstrates the absence of an issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).
Where the moving party has the burden at trial, "that party must support its motion with credible evidence . . . that would entitle it to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 331. The burden then shifts to the non-moving party "and requires that party . . . to produce evidentiary materials that demonstrate the existence of a 'genuine issue' for trial." Id.; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).
Where the non-moving party has the burden at trial, however, the moving party need not produce evidence negating or disproving every essential element of the non-moving party's case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Instead, the moving party's burden is met by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence supporting the non-moving party's case. Id.
The burden then shifts to the non-moving party to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved at trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. The non-moving party must make an affirmative showing on all matters placed in issue by the motion as [*13]  to which it has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. See also William W. Schwarzer, A. Wallace Tashima & James M. Wagstaffe, Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial § 14:144.
A genuine issue of material fact will exist "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Barlow v. Ground, 943 F. 2d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir. 1991); T.W. Elec. Serv. Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987).

IV. BNSF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
In short, BNSF's summary judgment motion argues that because Makor was released to work without limitation by Dr. Pyne on March 17, 2013, he was not disabled at the time he was dismissed on April 28, 2013. (DMSJ at 8-12.) Thus, as Makor was not disabled at the time of his termination, he could not have been discriminated against on the basis of a disability. (Id.) In the alternative, BNSF argues that Makor was not a qualified employee while he was disabled, which is fatal to his prima facie case of disability discrimination. Accordingly, BNSF argues, all of Makor's claims must fail as a matter of law.

A. Applicability of the McDonnell Douglas Process
BNSF contends that there is no direct evidence of discriminatory [*14]  intent in BNSF's actions to discharge Makor, and therefore the three-step test as set out by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), applies. (DMSJ at 7.) Makor argues that the application of BNSF's STD policy evinces discriminatory intent because: (1) the STD policy is facially discriminatory because it targets disabled employees on leave for more than 12 weeks; (2) discharging Makor because he took a leave of absence connected to his disability should not be permitted; and (3) BNSF's STD policy ignores its obligations to reasonably accommodate employees on disability leave. (DMSJ Opp'n at 7-8.)
In order to state a prima facie case of employment discrimination, the employee "must offer evidence that 'give[s] rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination,' either through the framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green or with direct or circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent.'" Vasquez v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 640 (9th Cir. 2003), as amended (Jan. 2, 2004) (footnotes omitted). The McDonnell Douglas test does not apply where there is direct evidence of employment discrimination. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S. Ct. 613, 83 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1985).
"Direct evidence is 'evidence which, if believed, proves the fact [of discriminatory animus] without inference or presumption.'" Vasquez, 349 F.3d at 640. While a facially discriminatory policy concerning employment can be direct [*15]  evidence of discrimination (see Trans World Airlines, 469 U.S. at 121), Makor has provided no evidence that the STD policy demonstrates a discriminatory animus without inference or presumption. Accordingly, the Court analyzes Makor's case under the three-step McDonnell Douglas process.

B. The Three-Step McDonnell Douglas Process and BNSF's Burden on its Motion for Summary Judgment
Where there is no evidence of discriminatory animus without inference or presumption, claims for disability discrimination arising under state or federal law14 are analyzed under the three-step process as set forth in McDonnell Douglas, which states that:
First, it is the plaintiff's burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff proves the prima facie case, then the burden shifts to the defendant to [articulate a] legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision. Third, if the defendant [offers such a reason], then the plaintiff must have an opportunity to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination . . . .
Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 342-43, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008).
At trial, it is the employee's burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination; [*16]  placing the burden on the employee is "designed to eliminate at the outset the most patently meritless claims, as where the plaintiff is not a member of the protected class or was clearly unqualified, or where the job he sought was withdrawn and never filled." Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000).
The McDonnell Douglas test was developed for use at trial, not summary judgment, however. Arteaga, 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 344, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008) (citation omitted). Thus, under California law,
[t]he burdens and order of proof . . . shift under the McDonnell Douglas test when an employer defendant seeks summary judgment. An employer defendant may meet its initial burden on summary judgment, and require the employee plaintiff to present evidence establishing a triable issue of material fact, by presenting evidence that either negates an element of the employee's prima face case, or establishes a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for taking the adverse employment action against the employee.
"[T]o avoid summary judgment [on the second of these two grounds], an employee claiming discrimination must offer substantial evidence that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual, or evidence the employer acted with a discriminatory animus, or a combination of the two, such [*17]  that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer engaged in intentional discrimination."
Swanson v. Morongo Unified Sch. Dist., 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014), as modified on denial of reh'g (Dec. 23, 2014) (citations omitted); see also, Arteaga, 163 Cal. App. 4th at 343-44; Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999).

1. Makor's Prima Facie Case of Discrimination
Under FEHA, it is unlawful to discriminate against any person due to a physical or mental disability; to state a prima facie case for discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must show "(1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and, (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability." Faust v. California Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 886, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007). "Mental disability" is defined in FEHA as: "(1) having a mental or psychological disorder or condition that limits a major life activity, including working; (2) any other mental or psychological disorder or condition that requires special education or related services; (3) having a record or history of a mental or psychological disorder or condition which is known to the employer or other entity covered by this part; or (4) being regarded or treated by the employer as having, or having had, any mental condition that makes achievement of a major life activity difficult." Foster v. City of Oakland, 649 F.Supp.2d 1008, 1016 (N.D. Cal. 2009); see also, Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(j).

a. Whether Makor Suffered from a Disability [*18]  at the Time He Was Released
As noted above, the burden at summary judgment rests with BNSF either to negate an element of Makor's prima facie case or establish a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for taking an adverse employment action against Makor. BNSF's primary argument in the DMSJ is that Makor was not disabled at the time he was released, so he could not have been released because of his disability.15
Case law supports the proposition that, if an employee cannot establish he was disabled at the time he was discharged, he cannot have been discharged on the basis of disability. Clark v. Data Works Corp, 2002 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6603, 2002 WL 1584232, at *6 (Cal. Ct. App. July 17, 2002) ("Whatever degree of disability the statute contemplates, at the very least an individual first must demonstrate the existence of a disability within the meaning of [FEHA].") The DMSJ, however, proceeds from the faulty assumption that an employee who returns to work without restriction is per se not disabled. "[F]requently . . . an employee is initially diagnosed with a disability, is placed under a physician's care, and eventually returns to work without any restrictions. . . . Yet [those] employees [can still be] physically disabled." Arteaga, 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 351-52, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008); see also, Lesinsky v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 2011 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 5783, 2011 WL 3251375, at *6 (Cal. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2011) ("At times, an employee released from a physician's care [*19]  without work restrictions can still invoke the FEHA's protections.") (citing Angell v. Peterson Tractor, Inc., 21 Cal. App. 4th 981, 987, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d 541 (1994) (employee who returned to work after a heart attack); Raytheon Co. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com., 212 Cal. App. 3d 1242, 1245, 1248-1250, 261 Cal. Rptr. 197 (1989) (employee released to work with no restrictions after AIDS diagnosis)).
Moreover, as noted in the DMSJ Opp'n, even assuming that Makor was no longer under the disabling effects of a mental disorder upon his return to work, he could still be considered disabled because he would have "a record or history of a mental or psychological disorder," which is sufficient to establish disability. (DMSJ Opp'n at 9-11.)
The California Code of Regulations defines "a record or history of disability" as "previously having, or being misclassified as having, a record or history of a mental or physical disability or special education health impairment of which the employer or other covered entity is aware." Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11065(d)(4). Given that this definition is recursive, i.e., the definition of the term refers back to itself, this is not particularly helpful in determining the breadth of the statute. Moreover, there is limited case law on the subject.
At least one unpublished California Court of Appeal case has expressed approval of Makor's argument. In Guerrero v. AmeriPride Servs., Inc., 2011 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6415, 2011 WL 3759935 (Cal. Ct. App. Aug. 25, 2011), the plaintiff, Guerrero, took two and a [*20]  half years off work after experiencing job-related stress. 2011 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6415, 2011 WL 3759935, at *2-3. Guerrero then reported to work expecting to return to his old position, but discovered that his employer had discharged him as a result of this sustained period of absence. 2011 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6415, [WL] at *3. In assessing whether Guerrero's claim for disability discrimination could survive summary judgment, the court explained
Guerrero was disabled and took a leave of absence from February 2005 to July 2007. During this two-years-and-five-month leave of absence, Guerrero suffered from a disability and could not perform essential job duties with or without reasonable accommodation. In July 2007, Guerrero was ready to return to work with the only restriction being that he maintain his current medication schedule. As Guerrero alleges, when he was released to return to work, AmeriPride was aware of his absence due to psychological issues, and he was qualified to resume the duties of his position without any restrictions. Although it could be argued that in July 2007 Guerrero was not disabled, Guerrero still suffered from a "mental disability," which includes "[h]aving a record or history of a mental or psychological disorder or condition . . . which is known to [*21]  the employer[.]" Guerrero was also able to perform essential job duties without reasonable accommodations. He thus satisfied the first two elements required for a prima facie case.
2011 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6415, [WL] at *9 (citation omitted). This sentiment was echoed in Roby v. Am. Airlines, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25101, 2006 WL 733495 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 22, 2006) aff'd sub nom. Roby v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 267 F. App'x 618 (9th Cir. 2008). There, the court addressed the argument that BNSF makes here, i.e., that a person released to return to work without restriction is no longer disabled, and can therefore be dismissed without implicating FEHA. The Roby court stated in a footnote that "the lifting of the medical restriction does not eliminate Plaintiff's position as someone with a physical disability, as Cal. Govt. Code § 12926(k)(3) includes in that class individuals with a history or record of physical disabilities." 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25101, [WL] at *8 n.6. Moreover, the court in Davis v. Vitamin World, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134723, 2011 WL 5865614, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011) found that even if the plaintiff had "no 'present disabling effect' at the time of her termination, [her employer's] knowledge of her medical history [was] sufficient to qualify her as 'disabled' under FEHA." An analogous provision in the ADA "is meant to cover individuals who at one time were limited to a degree that would [qualify as currently disabled], even though they have recovered from the impairment and would therefore not presently qualify under the current[ly [*22]  disabled] test." Wood v. Cnty. of Alameda, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17514, 1995 WL 705139, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 17, 1995).
Indeed, this Court found that, where an employer has knowledge of an employee's medical history, the employee can be considered physically disabled. Franco v. Pier 1 Imports, Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82341, 2008 WL 4217848, at *15 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 11, 2008) aff'd, 372 F. App'x 803 (9th Cir. 2010).
BNSF cites a recent district court case for the proposition that, once an employee returns to work without limitation, he or she is no longer disabled, and therefore an employer does not run afoul of FEHA if the employee is discharged. In Stevenson v. Abbott Laboratories, et al., Case No. SACV 13-579 DOC (RNBx), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 199793 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 21, 2014) ("Stevenson"), the plaintiff exhausted her short term disability plan and was then placed on leave without pay even though her doctor had declared her totally disabled. Stevenson, at 3, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 199793. When she returned from her disability leave, her employer had already filled her position, but encouraged her to try to find another within the company. Id. at 4-5, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 199793. When she failed to secure another position inside the company, she was discharged. Id. at 5, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 199793. The district court found that the plaintiff, because she had previously been released back to work by her doctor at the time of her discharge, was not disabled, and entered summary judgment against her on a disability discrimination claim. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 199793, at *15 ("At the [*23]  time of the second adverse employment action . . . there is no dispute that Ms. Stevenson no longer suffered from a disability. Therefore, again, she cannot make a prima facie showing of disability discrimination."). The Stevenson court did not analyze or consider whether the plaintiff met FEHA's definition of disabled because she had a record or history of disability.
Though none of these cases are binding or precedential, the Court agrees with the weight of authority holding that (1) an employee's release to return to work does not necessarily equate to non-disabled status; and (2) an employee's previous history of disability can also support a finding that he or she is disabled under FEHA.
Where, as here, an employee seeks to use his history of disability to establish the first element of a prima facie case of disability discrimination, he must also show that his employer knew of his history of disability. "[A]n employer 'knows an employee has a disability when the employee tells the employer about his condition, or when the employer otherwise becomes aware of the condition, such as through a third party or by observation. The employer need only know the underlying facts, not the [*24]  legal significance of those facts.'" Faust, 150 Cal. App. 4th at 887.
Here, the uncontroverted evidence shows that BNSF was aware of the "underlying facts" concerning Makor's condition; Clarke knew that Makor had a psychological condition that affected Makor's ability to work because he received two doctor's notes excusing Makor from work which explained Makor's condition. Moreover, Makor was required to submit medical documentation to MetLife in order to continue receiving his STD benefits; in this instance, MetLife is a third party that made BNSF aware of Makor's condition because BNSF continued to pay Makor's disability benefits. Hence, Makor has shown he had a disability and BNSF knew about it. The Court DENIES the DMSJ insofar as it is based on the argument that Makor was not disabled.16

b. Whether Makor Was Otherwise Qualified to Do His Job
The next element of Makor's prima facie case of discrimination is relevant to his claim for disability discrimination and his claims alleging that BNSF failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation and failed to engage in the interactive process with him. BNSF's contentions, however, flawed by the same false assumption discussed above, i.e., that Makor was per se [*25]  not disabled when he returned to work because he was returned to work without limitation.
BNSF argues that because Makor was not disabled upon his return to work on March 17, 2013, he cannot be a "qualified individual with a disability," and thus no obligation to offer Makor a reasonable accommodation or engage in the interactive process arose. (DMSJ at 8-12.) Makor argues that he was "otherwise qualified to do his job with the accommodation of a leave that protected his job, as was provided during plaintiff's FMLA/CFRA leave." (DMSJ Opp'n at 13.)
These arguments are not congruent; BNSF is arguing that no accommodation was required as of March 17, 2013, when Makor was released to work with no restriction. Makor is arguing that BNSF was required to provide him with an accommodation as of the date he was replaced as a Trainmaster on October 17, 2012. In response to Makor's argument, BNSF contends that until Makor was cleared to return to work, no accommodation was required because no accommodation would have allowed him to perform the essential functions of his position.
"Numerous courts have thus held that a plaintiff seeking relief under [FEHA], like a plaintiff seeking similar relief [*26]  under the ADA, must be able to perform the essential functions of the position at issue with or without reasonable accommodation." Diaz v. Fed. Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1060 (C.D. Cal. 2005). BNSF has not argued that Makor did not have the skills, training, or experience to be a Trainmaster; rather, BNSF contends that Makor could not perform the essential functions of his position as a Trainmaster because he was out on disability leave. (DMSJ at 12.)
The Court first addresses Makor's argument that BNSF was required to provide him with a reasonable accommodation at the time he was replaced in his position as Trainmaster.

i. BNSF's Position: Jackson, Algara, and Cortez
BNSF cites three cases to support its position. In Jackson v. Regus Mgmt. Grp., LLC, 2013 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 4520, 2013 WL 3215156 (Cal. Ct. App. June 26, 2013), the plaintiff was disabled and "totally incapacitated" from June 9, 2008 to June 10, 2009. Jackson, 2013 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 4520, 2013 WL 3215156, at *1. Unbeknownst to the plaintiff, however, she had been discharged on January 31, 2009 because her employer only allowed its employees six months of medical leave before dismissal. 2013 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 4520, [WL] at *2. The court held that the plaintiff "was unable to do the job even with reasonable accommodation" and "could not perform the essential job duties because she could not perform any of her work at all," because she was totally incapacitated and had no definite date [*27]  for return to work. 2013 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 4520, [WL] at *4. As the plaintiff's continuous absence from work was tantamount to an indefinite leave of absence -- which has been held not to be a reasonable accommodation -- the court found that plaintiff's employer had not acted unlawfully in discharging her. Id.; see also, Randolph v. FedEx-Federal Express Corporation, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9831, 2015 WL 403812, at *3 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 28, 2015) (granting summary judgment on plaintiff's claim for termination based on disability because, while disabled, plaintiff was unable to perform the duties of her job and no accommodation would have enabled her to do so).
BNSF further cites two unpublished cases in which a company's policy of offering short term disability leave, standing alone, is a sufficient reasonable accommodation. In Algara v. Auto. Club of S. California, 2012 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6148, 2012 WL 3582295 (Cal. Ct. App. Aug. 21, 2012), the plaintiff went out on medical leave of absence for an extended period. 2012 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6148, 2012 WL 3582295, at *1. Under the employer's policy, her job was only guaranteed for a limited time, however, and she was informed that her position had been filled because she had taken more than twelve weeks of leave. Id. Because the plaintiff did not elect to apply for long-term disability, which would have extended the date for her to return without being dismissed, she was dismissed after six months of leave. 2012 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6148, [WL] at *2, *6. The appellate court found that because the employer [*28]  had kept the plaintiff's position open for twelve weeks longer than it said it would, and because it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to fill her position, summary judgment was properly entered against the plaintiff on her failure to accommodate claim. 2012 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6148, [WL] at *5.
BNSF also cites Cortez v. Wilshire Aesthetics Med. Associates, Inc., 2009 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 5534, 2009 WL 1943485 (Cal. Ct. App. July 8, 2009). There, the plaintiff was diagnosed with cervical cancer. 2009 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 5534, [WL] at *1. From February to April, her employer allowed her to take time off from work to undergo tests and procedures; she went on disability leave in early April. Id. In late May, she was ready to return to work, but was told her services were no longer required because the office had been experiencing financial difficulties. Id. The trial court granted a nonsuit as to the plaintiff's disability claim because she "was not disabled when she sought to return to work, [her employer] had no obligation to further accommodate her or to engage in any interactive process with respect to a nonexistent disability." 2009 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 5534, [WL] at *7.

ii. Makor's Position: Humphrey and the CCR
Makor contends that BNSF was required to provide him with the reasonable accommodation of holding his position open upon the expiration of his FMLA leave on October 17, 2012, instead of replacing him and leaving [*29]  him with no position upon his return from disability leave. (DMSJ Opp'n at 16-17.)
The reasonable accommodation of an extended leave of absence while holding an employee's position open is permissible. In Humphrey, the Ninth Circuit analyzed the plaintiff's claims under the ADA and held that a leave of absence for medical treatment is a reasonable accommodation; the court also held that "where a leave of absence would reasonably accommodate an employee's disability and permit him, upon return, to perform the essential functions of the job, that employee is otherwise qualified under the ADA." 239 F.3d at 1135-36. The Ninth Circuit further observed that the ADA "does not require an employee to show that a leave of absence is certain or even likely to be successful to prove that it is a reasonable accommodation." Id. at 1136.
Moreover, the CCR puts the onus on the employer to make a reasonable accommodation for the disability of any employee if it knows about the disability, unless it can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11068(a).17 Moreover, the CCR explicitly contemplates a situation where an employee exhausts his leave under the FMLA or the employer's leave plan, when "holding a job open" or extending [*30]  that employee's leave of absence may be an acceptable reasonable accommodation. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11068(c).18 When the employee exhausts his leave under the employer's leave provisions, it is the duty of the employer to initiate the interactive process to determine if more leave is necessary. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11069 (b)(3).19
On the other hand, California courts reject the proposition that holding an employee's position open indefinitely is a reasonable accommodation. In Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487, (1999), the California Court of Appeal held that "a finite leave can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA, provided it is likely that at the end of the leave, the employee would be able to perform [*32]  his or her duties." 74 Cal. App. 4th at 226. There, the employee was given a sixteen month leave of absence, which was seven months longer than what he was entitled to under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Id. The court found that an additional seven months of leave was a sufficient reasonable accommodation, and no further accommodation was required thereafter. Id. at 227, 228. As a corollary to this, an employer is not required to offer an employee an accommodation that is likely to be futile. Schmidt v. Safeway Inc., 864 F. Supp. 991, 997 (D. Or. 1994).
The undisputed evidence indicates that, at the time of Makor's replacement as Trainmaster, neither Makor nor his physicians had told BNSF that he would return to work in any reasonable amount of time. Makor contends that a leave of absence while his job was held open would have been a reasonable accommodation because he eventually returned to work without restriction in March of 2013. But this is a post-hoc rationalization; from BNSF's perspective at the time Makor was replaced, it had no indication that Makor would ever return to his position. That Makor eventually did return to his job does not mean at the time he was replaced -- the adverse employment action taken here -- he was otherwise qualified.
If the Court [*33]  adopted Makor's position, any employee could argue he or she required the "reasonable accommodation" of having their position not filled by a replacement for an unspecified amount of time; this would be contrary to FEHA. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(1) ("[FEHA] does not prohibit an employer from . . . discharging an employee with a physical or mental disability, . . . where the employee, because of his or her physical or mental disability, is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations . . . .").
Accordingly, the Court finds that Makor cannot satisfy the second element of his prima facie case. As a result, entry of summary judgment is required as to Makor's first claim for disability discrimination.

B. Makor's Remaining Claims
As Makor cannot show he was a qualified individual, he cannot prevail as a matter of law on his claims that BNSF failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation. Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) ("The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability.")
With respect to Makor's [*34]  claim that BNSF failed to engage in the good-faith interactive process, the result is the same. "To prevail on a claim under section 12940, subdivision (n) for failure to engage in the interactive process, an employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Id. at 1018. A claim that an employer failed to engage in the good-faith interactive process "is the appropriate cause of action where the employee is unable to identify a specific, available reasonable accommodation while in the workplace and the employer fails to engage in a good faith interactive process to help identify one, but the employee is able to identify a specific, available reasonable accommodation through the litigation process." Id. at 1017. Here, Makor cannot identify a specific, available reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time he was replaced in his position at Trainmaster; the only accommodation he has identified that would have been applicable at that time was that BNSF hold his position open for an unspecified period of time until he returned. The Court has rejected the notion that this would have been a reasonable accommodation.
Makor's claim [*35]  for retaliation similarly fails. To establish a claim for retaliation under FEHA, "the plaintiff must show that he engaged in a protected activity, his employer subjected him to adverse employment action, and there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1065-66, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005) (citation omitted). Yanowitz defines engaging in a protected activity as "when the employee opposes conduct that ultimately is determined to be unlawfully discriminatory under the FEHA, but also when the employee opposes conduct that the employee reasonably and in good faith believes to be discriminatory, whether or not the challenged conduct is ultimately found to violate the FEHA." Id.
Here, Makor identifies no opposition to any conduct that occurred while he was employed by BNSF. This is fatal to his retaliation claim. To the extent Makor claims that "taking medical leave" is a protected activity, the Court rejects that argument as inconsistent with the clear holding of Yanowitz. (DMSJ Opp'n at 19 citing Holtzclaw v. Certainteed Corp., 795 F. Supp. 2d 996, 1019 (E.D. Cal. 2011).)
With respect to Makor's claim that BNSF failed to prevent discrimination, that claim fails along with his claim for disability discrimination. See Kelley v. Conco Companies, 196 Cal. App. 4th 191, 208, 126 Cal. Rptr. 3d 651 (2011); Trujillo v. N. Cnty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998), as modified (May 12, 1998).
Finally, as Makor's claim for [*36]  disability discrimination fails, Makor's claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy must fail as well. DeHorney v. Bank of Am. Nat. Trust & Sav. Ass'n, 879 F.2d 459, 465 (9th Cir. 1989) ("DeHorney's failure to make a prima facie case of racial discrimination disposes of [her claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy] as well.").
In sum, summary judgment is required as to all of Makor's claims. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the DMSJ and DENIES the PMSJ as MOOT.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the Court GRANTS the DMSJ and DENIES the PMSJ as MOOT. Summary judgment is entered in favor of BSNF on all claims.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
