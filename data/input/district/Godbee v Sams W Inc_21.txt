Opinion



ORDER ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint [DE 27] (the "Motion"), filed herein on December 2, 2021. The Court has considered the Motion, the Response [DE 28], the Reply [DE 29], and is otherwise fully advised in the premises. For the reasons stated herein, Defendant's Motion is granted in part and denied in part.

I. BACKGROUND
On March 5, 2021, Plaintiff Edith Godbee ("Plaintiff") filed this action against Defendant Sam's Club West, Inc. d/b/a Sam's Club ("Defendant"), alleging violations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. ("ADA"), the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. § 760 et seq. ("FCRA"), and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. ("FMLA"). [DE 1]. On April 12, 2021, Defendant moved to dismiss all counts pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). See [DE 11]. [*2]  On October 26, 2021, the Court entered an Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. See [DE 25]. The Court assumes the reader's familiarity with that Order. Therein, the Court dismissed all of Plaintiff's counts for failure to state a claim and with leave to amend, advising Plaintiff to consider all the arguments raised by Defendant's Motion in drafting an Amended Complaint. On November 9, 2021, Plaintiff filed her First Amended Complaint ("FAC"). [DE 26].
According to the factual allegations in the First Amended Complaint: Plaintiff was hired by Defendant on or about December 2, 2017, where she was employed as a maintenance associate. FAC ¶¶ 17-18. As part of her position as a maintenance associate, Plaintiff was tasked with cleaning bathrooms, mopping floors, and changing garbage bags. Id. at ¶ 21. In or about January 2019, Plaintiff informed her supervisor Carmen (ULN) ("Carmen") of Plaintiff's naval hernia, and the need to undergo surgery and take a leave of absence. Id. at ¶ 22. Carmen instructed Plaintiff to contact Sedgwick, a third-party company, to request the necessary leave. Id. at ¶ 20. Plaintiff initiated a leave of absence request with Sedgwick on January 22, 2019, [*3]  which was granted until in or about June or July 2019. Id. at ¶¶ 24-25
During the surgery, Plaintiff had a blockage that caused her to fall into a coma for approximately one month. Id. at ¶ 27. According to Plaintiff, because of the hernia and while in a coma, one or more of Plaintiff's major life activities were limited. Id. In or about July 2019, Plaintiff returned to work but was not feeling well and thereafter requested additional leave. Id. at ¶¶ 28-29.
In or about August 2019, Plaintiff informed Defendant that she was cleared by her physician to return to work for light duty. Id. at ¶ 30. In response, Defendant advised Plaintiff there were no positions available for maintenance associates and to apply for other positions. Id. at ¶ 31. According to Plaintiff, she requested Defendant to accommodate her by allowing her to work in a different position for which she qualified. Id. at ¶ 32. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that she inquired about the Greeter Associate position and applied for a vacant cashier position in the Defendant's café and/or deli. Id. at ¶¶ 33-34 Defendant did not hire Plaintiff for any of these positions and instructed her to stay home and apply for other positions. [*4]  Id. at ¶ 35. Plaintiff claims she advised her supervisors of her complaints to these practices. Id. at ¶ 36. As a result of Defendant's refusal to hire Plaintiff for any other positions, Plaintiff claims she was constructively discharged in or about August or September 2019. Id. at ¶ 37. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant's decision not to hire her for another position was clearly pretextual. Id.
Based upon the foregoing facts, the First Amended Complaint alleges the same seven claims against Defendant as Plaintiff's original complaint: Discrimination in Violation of the ADA - Termination (Count I); Retaliation in Violation of the ADA - Termination (Count II); Discrimination in Violation of the ADA - Failure to Accommodate (Count III); Discrimination in Violation of the FCRA - Termination (Count IV); Retaliation in Violation of the FCRA - Termination (Count V); Discrimination in Violation of the FCRA - Failure to Accommodate (Count VI); and Retaliation in Violation of the FMLA - Termination (Count VII). Defendant again seeks dismissal of all of Plaintiff's claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a complaint provide "a short and plain statement of the claim showing [*5]  that the pleader is entitled to relief." Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., 693 F. 3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012). A claim is subject to dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) if it does not plead 'enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl Corp. v. Twobly, 550 U.S. 544, 547 (2007). The Supreme Court has explained this standard as follows: A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a "probability requirement," but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 US. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (internal citation omitted). This pleading standard does not require "detailed factual allegations," but it does demand "more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Chaparro, 693 F.3d at 1337. Thus, a claim will survive a motion to dismiss only if the factual allegations in the pleading are "enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Twombly, 550 US. at 555.
In considering a party's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the allegations in the complaint must be accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Powell v. Thomas, 643 F. 3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir. 2011). But the Court need not accept as true "labels and conclusions," "formulaic recitation[s] [*6]  of the elements of a cause of action," nor legal conclusions couched as factual allegations. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; Chaparro, 693 F. 3d at 1337. Thus, evaluation of a motion to dismiss requires two steps: (1) eliminate any allegations in the pleading that are merely legal conclusions, and (2) where there are well-pleaded factual allegations, "assume their veracity and . . . determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 664.

III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the ADA (Counts I, II, and III), the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 (Counts IV, V, and VI), and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (Count VII). By the instant Motion, Defendant seeks to dismiss all claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.

A. Disability Discrimination Under the ADA and FCRA (Counts I and IV)
In order to sustain a discrimination claim under the ADA or the FCRA1 in the absence of direct evidence, Plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she had a disability; (2) she was a qualified individual; (3) an adverse employment action was taken against her because the disability. See Leme v. S. Baptist Hosp. of Florida, Inc., 248 F. Supp. 3d 1319, 1338-39 (M.D. Fla. 2017).
Defendant seeks to dismiss Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims under the ADA and FCRA because Plaintiff has failed to allege an actual disability and because she has failed to allege [*7]  facts establishing that the adverse employment action was a result of her disability. Defendant further argues Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims fail to allege an adverse employment action because Plaintiff's allegations relating to her constructive discharge are merely conclusory. The Court discusses each argument in turn.

1. Plaintiff's Disability
Defendant first argues that Plaintiff fails to allege a disability because Plaintiff's medical condition was "temporary," and Plaintiff otherwise pleads no facts demonstrating that Plaintiff had a disability or was perceived as having a disability. To sufficiently plead a disability under the ADA, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to show: "(1) that his alleged impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities, (2) that he has a record of such an impairment, or (3) that his employer regards him as having such an impairment." Dixon v. McArthur Dairy, LLC, No. 09-21774-CIV-SEITZ, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74305, 2010 WL 2985634, at *3 (S.D. Fla. July 23, 2010) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)).
First, the EEOC has stated that "[t]he determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity requires an individualized assessment." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(iv); see also Garrett v. Univ. Ala. at Birmingham Bd. of Trs., 507 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th Cir. 2007) ("Each claim of disability must be considered on a case-by-case basis. When the symptoms of an impairment [*8]  vary widely from person to person, an individualized assessment of the effect of an impairment is particularly necessary."). The "substantially limits" and "major life activity" requirements do not impose demanding standards and are to be construed broadly in favor of coverage. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 1630.2(i)(2), 1630.2(j)(1)(i). Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not contain a heightened pleading requirement for employment discrimination suits. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 511, 514, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). While the First Amended Complaint describes the events leading up to Plaintiff's alleged discharge and describes the basis of her alleged disability, she does not identify how this impairment has substantially limited a major life activity, such as her ability to lift objects, stand, or work. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A) (defining major life activities as including "performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, . . . and working," among others).
Nevertheless, Plaintiff's brief in opposition suggests that Plaintiff is proceeding under the last definition of disability: that Plaintiff was "regarded as" disabled by Defendant. See [DE 28] at 6. The ADA describes this definition as follows:
An individual meets the requirement [*9]  of "being regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.
42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A). The relevant inquiry in a "regarded as" disability case is not the plaintiff's actual condition, but how the defendant "perceived [her] condition, including the reactions and perceptions of the persons interacting or working with [her]." Mayorga v. Alorica, Inc., No. 12-21578-CIV, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103766, 2012 WL 3043021, at *8 (S.D. Fla. July 25, 2012) (internal citations and quotations omitted).
Importantly, however, the ADA advises that this definition "shall not apply to impairments that are transitory and minor. A transitory impairment is an impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months or less." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(B). Therefore, Defendant must establish that the impairment is both "transitory" and "minor" to overcome Plaintiff's allegation that she was "regarded as" having a disability. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.15(f) ("It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination by an individual claiming coverage under the 'regarded as' prong of the definition of disability that the impairment is . . . or would be . . . 'transitory and [*10]  minor.'"). "Because this is a defense to the claim, it would be appropriate to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) only if the defense is apparent from the face of the complaint." Dube v. Texas Health & Hum. Servs. Comm'n, No. SA-11-CV-354-XR, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99680, 2011 WL 3902762, at *5 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 6, 2011); see also Mayorga, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103766, 2012 WL 3043021 at *8 ("To the extent that this defense is apparent from the face of the Complaint, it is an appropriate basis for dismiss the claim that [the defendant] regarded [the plaintiff] as having a disability.").
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's "regarded as" claim fails because it is evident that Plaintiff's medical condition was transitory and minor as it merely required her to work on light-duty for a certain period of time. The First Amended Complaint only alleges that Plaintiff initiated her leave on January 22, 2019, which was granted until in or about June or July 2019. FAC ¶¶ 24-25. Upon her return to work, Plaintiff was not feeling well and requested additional leave, providing Defendant with the paperwork it requested. Id. at ¶ 29. Plaintiff again returned to work in or about August of 2019 and "informed Defendant that due to her medical condition, her physician placed her on light duty status." Id. at ¶ 31. In response to this request, Defendant advised Plaintiff that her position as maintenance associate was no longer [*11]  available and to apply for other positions. Id.
Construing all the allegations in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, all the facts in the First Amended Complaint suggest that Plaintiff's impairment lasted about eight months at minimum, from the time she requested leave in January 2019 to the time she requested light duty status in August of 2019. Moreover, though the ADA does not define "minor," it is not apparent from the face of the First Amended Complaint that Plaintiff's impairment was minor, and Plaintiff's request for light duty status does not conclusively resolve this question. Whether Plaintiff's medical condition was minor is a factual question that would be properly resolved at a later stage in the litigation. Id. at *9 ("[W]hether [Plaintiff]'s impairment was 'minor' presents a similar question of fact that is not properly resolved on a motion to dismiss."); E.E.O.C. v. Am. Tool & Mold, Inc., 21 F. Supp. 3d 1268, 1278 (M.D. Fla. 2014) (determining on summary judgment that the employer perceived an applicant with uncontrolled diabetes as having an actual or perceived impairment that is not transitory and minor). Defendant's case law in support of dismissal is unpersuasive or inapplicable. See, e.g., Trabulsy v. Polk Cmty. Coll., No. 8:08-CV-02271T33AEP, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54731, 2010 WL 1837909, at *2 (M.D. Fla. May 3, 2010) (determining on summary judgment that "[t]he record evidence [*12]  . . . shows that [plaintiff]'s medical issues were temporary in nature" and therefore not protected disabilities).
Construing the allegations in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, it is not apparent from the face of the First Amended Complaint that Plaintiff's impairment was transitory and minor. The Court finds, at least at this stage, that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a "regarded as" disability under the ADA. Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims on this basis.

2. Adverse Employment Action Because of Plaintiff's Disability
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff fails to adequately plead a constructive discharge, let alone that Plaintiff was terminated because of an alleged disability. "[T]he ADA prohibits a broad variety of adverse employment actions, whenever those actions are taken for a prohibited reason." McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1077 (11th Cir. 1996). The Eleventh Circuit has held in dicta that a constructive discharge can be an adverse action. Griffin v. GTE Florida, Inc., 182 F.3d 1279, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 1999). To plead and prove a constructive discharge, "a plaintiff must demonstrate that working conditions were 'so intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would have been compelled to resign.'" Id. Moreover, the plaintiff [*13]  must show that the employer intentionally rendered the employee's working conditions so intolerable based on a protected status, such as disability, that the employee was compelled to quit involuntarily. Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 907 (11th Cir. 1982).
In her First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that "[u]pon her return to work . . . in or about August of 2019 . . . Defendant advised Plaintiff that there were no positions available for maintenance associates and to apply for other positions." FAC ¶ 31. Plaintiff further alleges that she inquired about one position and applied for another vacant position but that "Defendant did not hire Plaintiff for any of these positions, and instead, instructed Plaintiff to stay home and continue to apply for other positions." Id. at ¶¶ 31-35. According to Plaintiff, "in or about August or September 2019, Plaintiff was constructively discharged because Defendant refused to hire Plaintiff for any other positions." Id. at ¶ 37.
Defendant is correct in its assessment that Plaintiff has not pled any facts describing Plaintiff's working conditions, let alone facts sufficient to demonstrate her working conditions were intolerable or objectively unreasonable. However, it is apparent to the Court [*14]  that Plaintiff pleads constructive discharge not in the legal understanding of the term, but in a layman's understanding of the term. See FAC ¶ 31 ("Upon her return to work in or about August of 2019, Plaintiff informed Defendant that due to her medical condition, her physician placed her on light duty status. In response, Defendant advised Plaintiff that there were no positions available for maintenance associates and to apply for other positions.") (emphasis added). Put another way, Plaintiff's "constructive discharge" allegation is merely a termination allegation, i.e., that Defendant terminated Plaintiff when Defendant informed Plaintiff that her maintenance associate job was no longer available. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) (prohibiting discrimination "on the basis of disability in regard to . . . the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment."). That Plaintiff merely labels the series of events leading up to her termination a "constructive discharge" does not render her pleadings deficient. As such, the Court will not dismiss Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims on this basis.
The Court is also [*15]  unpersuaded by Defendant's argument that Plaintiff fails to allege facts that she was subject to discrimination because of her disability. Liberally construing the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff's allegations indicate that Defendant informed Plaintiff that her job as maintenance associate was no longer available after Plaintiff informed Defendant of her medical condition and need for light duty status upon her return to work. See FAC ¶ 31. Such temporal proximity could support an inference of discrimination. See, e.g., Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999)2; see also Andrews v. City of Hartford, 700 F. App'x 924, 927 (11th Cir. 2017) (stating that a plaintiff must allege plausible facts that could give rise to an inference of disability discrimination).
Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss Counts I and IV must be denied.

B. Failure to Accommodate Under the ADA and FCRA (Counts III and VI)
In Counts III and VI, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability in violation of the ADA and FCRA. To establish a failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA, Plaintiff must show that: (1) the disability was known to Defendant; (2) she was qualified to perform the essential duties of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) Defendant refused to reasonably [*16]  accommodate her disability. Pritchard v. Southern Co. Services, 92 F.3d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir. 1996). Likewise, to establish a failure-to-accommodate claim under the FCRA, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: "(1) she was a qualified individual with a disability; (2) she made a specific request for a reasonable accommodation; and (3) her employer . . . failed to provide a reasonable accommodation." D'Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, 964 F.3d 1014, 1021 (11th Cir. 2020). "The plaintiff bears the burden both to identify an accommodation and show that it is reasonable." Rabb v. Sch. Bd. of Orange County, Fla., 590 Fed. Appx. 849, 850 (11th Cir. 2014); Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998). Unless the employer can prove undue hardship, the failure to reasonably accommodate an otherwise qualified, disabled employee itself constitutes discrimination. Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007).
Defendant seeks to dismiss Counts III and VI, arguing that a request for light duty status, even if designated by a physician, fails to state a claim for a reasonable accommodation. In support of its argument, Defendant cites two cases from the Middle District of Florida, Hickmon and Maack. These cases were resolved on summary judgment; they do not establish that Plaintiff's claims fail as a matter of law despite allegations that Plaintiff requested an accommodation. See Hickmon v. TECO Energy2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2339, 2012 WL 39582, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 9, 2012) ("[Defendant] is entitled to summary judgment on [plaintiff]'s claim . . . because [*17]  [plaintiff] does not point to any record evidence reflecting that she identified to [defendant] or requested from [defendant] a specific accommodation, which was both reasonable and would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job."); Maack v. Sch. Bd. of Brevard Cty., No. 6:12-CV-612-ORL-28, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163070, 2013 WL 6050749, at *12 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 15, 2013) (granting summary judgment where the Court could not conclude that plaintiff's doctor note constituted a request for reasonable accommodation).
Moreover, what constitutes a reasonable accommodation (and therefore a request for reasonable accommodation) depends on the circumstances, but may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, [and] reassignment to a vacant position" among other things. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). Put differently, the ADA expressly requires that employers consider modification of job functions or work schedules or reassignment to a vacant position as a form of reasonable accommodation. This can, depending on the factual circumstances, include a request for light duty work.3
Here, Plaintiff alleges that upon her return to work she informed Defendant of her need to be placed on light duty status. FAC ¶ 31. Plaintiff further alleges that after Defendant [*18]  informed her that her previous position was unavailable, she "requested Defendant accommodate her by allowing her to work in a different position for which she qualified." Id. at ¶¶ 31-32. She alleges that at least one vacant cashier position was available for which she believed she was qualified. Id. at ¶ 34. Taking these allegations as true and drawing all factual inferences in favor of Plaintiff, the Court sees no reason for Plaintiff's accommodation claims not to proceed at this time.
Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claims on these grounds.

C. Retaliation Under the ADA and FCRA (Counts II and V)
Defendant also moves to dismiss Counts II and V of the Complaint for retaliation under the ADA and FCRA. To establish an ADA retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she "engaged in conduct protected by the ADA"; (2) she "was subjected to an adverse employment action at the time, or after the protected conduct took place"; and (3) the defendant "took an adverse employment action against [an employee] because of [the employee's] protected conduct." Collado v. United Parcel Serv., Co., 419 F.3d 1143, 1158 (11th Cir. 2005). Similarly, under the FCRA, a plaintiff asserting a retaliation claim must show that: "(1) [*19]  [s]he engaged in protected activity, (2) [s]he suffered an adverse action, and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse action." Shedrick v. Dist. Bd. of Trustees of Miami-Dade Coll., 941 F. Supp. 2d 1348, 1366-67 (S.D. Fla. 2013); see also Arnold v. Heartland Dental, LLC, 101 F. Supp. 3d 1220, 1226 (M.D. Fla. 2015). Protected activities can consist of "opposing unlawful employment practices or participating in making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing regarding an unlawful employment practice." Shedrick, 941 F. Supp. 2d at 1367. Moreover, "[t]o prove a causal connection, we require a plaintiff only to demonstrate that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated." Shotz v. City of Plantation, Fla., 344 F.3d 1161, 1180 n.30 (11th Cir. 2003).
As an initial matter, Defendant seeks to dismiss Counts II and V for the same reason it seeks to dismiss all claims based on Plaintiff's alleged termination: because Plaintiff fails to sufficiently plead a constructive discharge. As the Court explained as to Counts I and IV, Plaintiff plausibly alleges that she was terminated when Defendant informed Plaintiff that her job was no longer available. See supra.
Defendant also argues Counts II and V should be dismissed because Plaintiff fails to allege facts showing that she engaged in a statutorily protected activity or that any adverse employment action [*20]  was casually related to that protected activity. The Court agrees.
Other than her conclusory assertion that "Plaintiff engaged in a protected activity by opposing Defendant's discriminatory practices," Plaintiff fails to show that an adverse action, whether it was her constructive termination or Defendant's refusal to hire, was casually related to the protected conduct. FAC ¶ 52. The First Amended Complaint alleges that Defendant did not hire Plaintiff for a vacant cashier position and that "in or about late 2019, Plaintiff advised her supervisors, Joy, Elena, and Carmen of her complaints and of opposition to Defendant's discriminatory practices." FAC ¶ 34-36. Significantly, it is unclear from the allegations whether Defendant's alleged retaliatory conduct occurred before or after these complaints. In her Response in Opposition, Plaintiff describes these allegations as follows: "[A]fter Defendant refused to employ Plaintiff in another position, Plaintiff spoke with her supervisors . . . and complained about Defendant's decision not to employ her in another position because of her disability or perceived disability and objected to such discriminatory actions." [DE 28] at 9-10 (emphasis [*21]  and internal citations omitted). Without further allegations regarding Defendant's conduct after Plaintiff complained, it is not plausible that Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff for complaints made after Defendant's alleged refusal to hire.4
Accordingly, the Court will dismiss Counts II and V for failure to state a claim. As Plaintiff has failed to state any viable retaliation claims after two attempts and has otherwise failed to overcome the deficiencies that resulted in the Court's dismissal of the original retaliation claims, it appears that amendment would be futile. Therefore, the dismissal is with prejudice.

D. Retaliation Under the FMLA (Count VII)
"To state a claim of retaliation under the FLMA, 'an employee must allege that (1) he engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) the decision was causally related to the protected activity." See Walker v. Elmore County Bd. of Educ., 379 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir. 2004) (quoting Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1207 (11th Cir 2001)).
Defendant moves to dismiss Count VII solely for the same reason it seeks to dismiss all claims based on Plaintiff's alleged termination: because Plaintiff fails to sufficiently plead a constructive discharge. As the Court explained as to Counts [*22]  I and IV, Plaintiff plausibly alleges that she was terminated when Defendant informed Plaintiff that her job was no longer available. See supra. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss as to Count VII is due to be denied.

IV. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:
1. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint [DE 27] is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.
2. Count II (Retaliation in Violation of the ADA) and Count V (Retaliation in Violation of the FCRA) are hereby DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Counts I, III, IV, VI, and VII may proceed.
3. Defendant shall file its answer to the remaining counts of the First Amended Complaint on or before March 3, 2022.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at Fort Lauderdale, Broward County, Florida, this 17th day of February 2022.
