Opinion



ORDER RE PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [38]
This matter is before the Court on Plaintiff Chris Langer's Motion for Summary Judgement ("MSJ"). [Doc. # 38.] For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiff's MSJ.

I.

EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
Defendant Mobeeus, Inc. objects to Plaintiff's counsel's declaration and its attempt to authenticate his Exhibit 5 and 6, which are photographs purportedly taken by a former investigator, Zion Sapien, and Sapien's investigation notes from a visit to Defendant's store on April 2, 2019. See Def.'s Objs. at 25-26 [*2]  [Doc. # 39]. Plaintiff's counsel attests that Sapien conducted an investigation of the store, uploaded his photos to her organization, and saved to the case file in the usual course of business. MSJ, Ex. 1 (Masanque Decl.) at ¶¶ 3-4. Defendant argues that the declaration fails to show counsel's personal knowledge of the photos and notes and thus fails to lay a foundation to authenticate them. See Clark v. Cty. of Tulare, 755 F. Supp. 2d 1075, 1084 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (finding documentary evidence attached to an attorney affidavit not properly authenticated and inadmissible at summary judgment). Plaintiff did not respond to this evidentiary objection in his Reply.
The Court SUSTAINS Defendant's objection to Plaintiff's counsel's declaration and to Sapien's photos and notes.
The Court OVERRULES as moot Defendant's objection to the copy of Plaintiff's disabled persons placard because the Court does not rely on it. See Defs.' Objs. at 27.
In addition, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's "objection to the motion in its entirety" for being filed one week after the motion cut-off date. See id. Although the Court admonishes Plaintiff for failure to abide by the Court's Scheduling and Case Management Order, Defendant also violated the Local Rules by filing a belated [*3]  Opposition. In the interest of streamlining this case for trial, the Court proceeds to rule on the motion.

II.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff is paraplegic who cannot walk and uses a wheelchair for mobility. Defs.' Statement of Facts ("DSF") at ¶ 1 [Doc. # 39].1 He uses a specially equipped van with a ramp that deploys from the passenger side of the van to accommodate his wheelchair. Id. at ¶ 2. At all relevant times, Defendant Mobeeus, Inc. is and was the owner and operator of Schwartz's, a kosher Shabbat take-out food store and caterer at 8856 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, California. Id. at ¶¶ 3-4; Opp. Ex. C (Hecht Decl.) at ¶ 2 [Doc. # 39]. It is a takeout only store, and since its opening in May 2017, it is always closed on Mondays, Saturdays, and Jewish holidays. Hecht Decl. at ¶¶ 2-3. During the pandemic, it is open only on Thursdays and Fridays, with early closings on Fridays to prepare for and observe the Jewish Sabbath. Id. at ¶ 2.
Plaintiff asserts that on March 25, 2019, he visited Schwartz's to buy something to eat and to assess it for compliance with access laws. Id. at ¶ 6. He attests that he found one parking space marked and reserved for persons with disabilities, [*4]  but that it was not marked as "van accessible" and was obstructed by a dumpster, thereby preventing him from using it. MSJ, Ex. 2 (Langer Decl.) at ¶¶ 6-7 [Doc. # 38-5]. Attached to Plaintiff's motion are photos he asserts that he took that day depicting a dumpster in the marked accessible parking space, with a tall white plank obscuring any signage on the wall. MSJ, Ex. 4 [Doc. # 38-7]. Defendant disputes that he visited Schwartz's at all, and the store was not open that day, a Monday. Hecht Decl. at ¶¶ 1, 6. Moreover, Defendant's Chief Executive Officer Daniel Hecht attests that he never placed the white object against the wall blocking the "handicapped sign" and accuses Plaintiff of "seemingly brac[ing]" the dumpster "against the wall long enough to hold up that long white object." Id. at ¶ 9.
Plaintiff also attests that he has been deterred from visiting Schwartz's because of his knowledge of the inaccessible parking space. On May 24, 2019, he "stopped to get gas at the Shell station half a mile away from" the store. Langer Decl. at ¶ 10. As proof of his visit to the area, he submitted a receipt showing snacks purchased at the Shell gas station at 8500 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, [*5]  California at 11:40 am. on May 24, 2019. Reply, Ex. 1 (Langer Supp. Decl.) at ¶ 2 [Doc. # 40-1]; id., Ex. 2 (receipt) [Doc. # 40-2].2 Schwartz's was open from 11:00 a.m. to about 4:30 p.m. that day. Hecht Decl. at ¶ 7. Plaintiff was also deterred from visiting the store again on October 9, 2019, when he was again in the neighborhood. Langer Decl. at ¶ 11. The store was not open on that day for Yom Kippur. Hecht Decl. at ¶ 8.
On October 5, 2020, Plaintiff's investigator Corey Taylor visited Schwartz's and counted "approximately 3-5" parking spaces in its parking lot, one of which had a parking space designated for use by persons with disabilities and signage indicating that it was "van accessible." MSJ, Ex. 7 (Taylor Decl.) at ¶¶ 1-5 [Doc. # 38-10]. Taylor measured a slope of 2.6% in the access aisle and a cross-slope of 2.3% in the parking stall of the designated accessible parking space. Id. at ¶¶ 6-7; MSJ, Ex. 8 (photos of slope reading). The sign on the wall of the store indicating the parking space's accessibility was placed 48 inches above the ground. Taylor Decl. at ¶ 8; MSJ, Ex. 8 (photo of sign measurement). On follow-up visits to the store on December 9 and 10, 2020, Taylor [*6]  observed vehicles without disabled persons placards parking in the designated accessible parking space. Taylor Decl. at ¶¶ 9-10. He also observed several chairs placed around the edges of the parking stall of that space. Id. at ¶ 12.
Plaintiff's construction expert, Cory Slater, a general contractor with 32 years of experience building and renovating commercial and residential properties in California, estimates that resurfacing the accessible parking space to reduce the slopes to under 2.1% and re-stripe the stall and access aisle would cost Defendant $1,768. MSJ, Ex. 10 (Slater Decl.) at ¶¶ 1-5 [Doc. # 38-13]; id., Ex. 11 (Slater job estimate) [Doc. # 38-14].
According to Defendant's CEO Hecht, the small parking lot in fact contains one van accessible space, one standard parking space, and two spaces for bicycles. Hecht Decl. at ¶ 4. Hecht explains the slope of the parking lot by pointing to Defendant's permit from the City of Los Angeles to grade the parking lot for a new City-manded grease interceptor. Id. at ¶ 5; see Opp., Ex. B (grading permit) [Doc. # 39]. Hecht also attests that he measured the van accessible parking space and found the parking stall measured 111.75 inches wide, [*7]  and the access aisle measured 100.5 inches wide. Hecht Decl. at ¶ 4; Opp., Ex. A (photograph) [Doc. # 39].
On April 9, 2019, Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this action alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and California's Unruh Civil Rights Act ("Unruh Act"). [Doc. # 1.] On May 7, 2019, Defendant filed an Answer. [Doc. # 11.] On January 2, 2020, the Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Unruh Act claim. [Doc. # 28.]
On January 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed the instant MSJ, which is fully briefed. [Doc. ## 38, 39, 40.]

III.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment should be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); accord Wash. Mut. Inc. v. United States, 636 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Nat'l Ass'n of Optometrists & Opticians v. Harris, 682 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248.
The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its initial burden, Rule 56(c) requires the nonmoving party to "go beyond the pleadings and by [his [*8]  or] her own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e)). "In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). "Rather, it draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Id.
Where the issues before the Court are questions of law, the case is particularly "well suited" for summary judgment. Del Real, LLC v. Harris, 966 F. Supp. 2d 1047, 1051 (E.D. Cal. 2013); see also Asuncion v. Dist. Dir. of U.S. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 427 F.2d 523, 524 (9th Cir. 1970) (concluding that the district court properly resolved a motion for summary judgment where the issues presented were comprised solely of questions of law).

IV.

DISCUSSION
Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on his sole remaining claim under Title III of the ADA. To prevail on a Title III ADA discrimination claim, a plaintiff must show: he or she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; the defendant owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; the existing facility at the defendant's place of business or property presents an architectural barrier; and the removal of the barrier is readily achievable. See Vogel v. Rite Aid Corp., 992 F. Supp. 2d 998, 1007-08 (C.D. Cal. 2014). "The enforcement provisions of [*9]  Title III provide only for injunctive relief. Damages are not available to individuals." Pickern v. Holiday Quality Foods, 293 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir. 2002).
Defendant argues that disputed facts preclude summary judgment and that Plaintiff has never actually been to the store and therefore has no real knowledge of it. The Court construes this latter argument as an argument against Plaintiff's standing to sue and therefore addresses it first.

A. Standing
To establish standing to seek injunctive relief under the ADA, a plaintiff "must demonstrate that he has suffered an injury-in-fact, that the injury is traceable to the [defendant's] actions, . . . that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision[,] . . . . [and that there is] a 'real and immediate threat of repeated injury' in the future." Chapman v. Pier 1 Imps. (U.S.), Inc. ("Chapman I"), 631 F.3d 939, 946 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (quoting Fortyune v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1081 (9th Cir. 2004)). An ADA plaintiff suffers an injury-in-fact if he or she "encounters an accessibility barrier" that "interfere[s] with the particular plaintiff's 'full and equal enjoyment' of the facility." Id. at 947 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a)). Further, an ADA plaintiff shows a likelihood of future injury "when discriminatory architectural barriers deter him from returning to a noncompliant accommodation." Id. at 949.
It is possible that [*10]  Plaintiff does not have standing to sue based solely on his March 25, 2019 visit to the store. He attested under penalty of perjury that he attempted to visit the store and was unable to park due to the dumpster taking up "almost all of the space in the parking stall." See Langer Decl. at ¶ 6. Because the store was closed that day, however, it is not clear that any inability to park interfered with his full enjoyment of the facility. But because Plaintiff also claims that he subsequently returned to Schwartz's vicinity but was deterred from visits to the store due to his knowledge of the blocked parking space, he has demonstrated "an intent to return to the geographic area where the accommodation is located and a desire to visit the accommodation if it were made accessible." D'Lil v. Best W. Encina Lodge & Suites, 538 F.3d 1031, 1037 (9th Cir. 2008). This deterrence is arguably a cognizable injury-in-fact. See Chapman I, 631 F.3d at 949 ("A disabled individual also suffers a cognizable injury if he is deterred from visiting a noncompliant public accommodation because he has encountered barriers related to his disability there."). This injury may be redressed by injunctive relief, but Defendant denies that the parking space was ever blocked. Hecht Decl. at ¶ 9. Plaintiff's own investigator [*11]  attests that he observed cars parked in the designated accessible parking space, albeit without a disabled persons placard. Taylor Decl. at ¶¶ 9-10.
Nonetheless, Plaintiff also claims that the slope of the parking space is non-compliant. To the extent that the slope is undisputed, Plaintiff has standing to sue as to that condition.
Accordingly, there is a triable issue as to whether Plaintiff suffered an injury-in-fact such that he has standing to sue as to the alleged blockage of the parking space, but he has standing to sue as to the slope of the designated parking space.3

B. Plaintiff's Disability and Defendant's Public Accommodation
It is undisputed that Plaintiff is a paraplegic who uses a wheelchair for mobility and that, at all relevant times, Defendant was the owner and operator of Schwartz's, which is a place of public accommodation within the meaning of the ADA. The first two elements are thus satisfied.

C. The Store's Architectural Barriers
Defendant does not dispute that the slope of the parking stall is 2.3% in at least one place, and the slope of the access aisle is 2.6% in at least one place. Under the 2010 ADA Accessibility Guidelines ("ADAAG"), "[a]ccess aisles shall [*12]  be at the same level as the parking spaces they serve" and "[c]hanges in level are not permitted," except that "[s]lopes not steeper than 1:48 [2.083% grade] shall be permitted." 36 C.F.R. Pt. 1191, App. D, § 502.4. The current slopes of the accessible parking stall and access aisle thus violate the 2010 ADAAG.
The undisputed facts do not support finding any other architectural barriers. First, the parking stall and access aisle are of sufficient width. As the only accessible parking space in the lot, it must be a van parking space either 132 inches wide with a 60-inch-wide adjacent access aisle, or 96 inches wide with a 96-inch-wide adjacent access aisle. 36 C.F.R. Pt. 1191, App. D, § 502.2-502.3. The only admissible evidence of the parking space and access aisle's width shows that they are 111.75 inches wide and 100.5 inches wide, respectively. See Hecht Decl. at ¶ 4; Opp., Ex. A (photograph).
Second, Plaintiff has not shown a genuine dispute of material fact over whether the dumpster in the parking space constitutes an architectural barrier. Even assuming the dumpster was placed in the parking space when Plaintiff visited Schwartz's, the Department of Justice's Technical Assistance Manual ("TAM"), published to provide technical assistance to entities covered [*13]  by Title III of the ADA, "explains that '[a]n isolated instance of placement of an object on an accessible route would not be a violation, if the object is promptly removed.'" Chapman v. Pier 1 Imps. (U.S.), Inc. ("Chapman II"), 779 F.3d 1001, 1006 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Miller, 536 F.3d at 1026). Although this instruction is specific to accessible routes, it is relevant by analogy to accessible parking spaces. The dumpster allegedly was present in the parking space only on Plaintiff's visit to Schwartz's on a day it was not open, and there is no indication that the dumpster was not promptly removed. Furthermore, Hecht disputes that Defendant is responsible for placing the dumpster in the accessible parking spot and accuses Plaintiff of placing the dumpster there as a "malicious and malevolent act." Hecht Decl. at ¶ 9. If that is the case, then Plaintiff cannot be said to have been "denied public accommodations by the defendant because of [his] disability." Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 730 (9th Cir. 2007) (emphasis added). The same principle applies to people allegedly parking in the accessible parking space without a disability placard. Even if it were possible to prove that the individuals parked there that day were not disabled (a dubious proposition on these facts), Defendant cannot [*14]  be held liable for the actions of guests over whom it has no control. Thus, even assuming that the dumpster was in the accessible parking spot on one day when Plaintiff visited and that some people parked in the spot without a disability placard on one day, these issues do not constitute architectural barriers as a matter of law.
Third, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the chairs placed around the edge of the accessible parking space rendered the space unusable or otherwise impeded Plaintiff's "full and equal enjoyment of accommodations." Chapman I, 631 F.3d at 945. Plaintiff's investigator's photos show that another vehicle was able to park in the accessible space despite the presence of the chairs.
Fourth, although Plaintiff is correct that in most parking lots, the sign designating the space as "van accessible" must be 60 inches above the ground, "[w]here a total of four or fewer parking spaces, including accessible parking spaces, are provided on a site, identification of accessible parking spaces shall not be required." 36 C.F.R. Pt. 1191, App. C, § F216.5; 36 C.F.R. Pt. 1191, App. D, § 502.6. Although Plaintiff's investigator said he noticed "approximately 3-5 parking spaces" in the lot, his and Plaintiff's photos of the lot support a finding of a maximum of three [*15]  parking spaces: one van accessible space and two standard parking spaces. See Taylor Decl. at ¶ 4. Hecht's assertion that the lot in fact contains just one van accessible space, one standard parking space, and two bicycle spaces is plausible and not controverted by the evidence Plaintiff presented. Because the uncontroverted evidence indicates that the lot has fewer than four parking spaces, Defendant is not required to provide the signage for the accessible space required by the ADAAG for larger parking lots. Therefore, Defendant has not violated the ADA by voluntarily placing its sign only 48 inches above the ground.
Relatedly, Defendant argues that because the 2010 ADAAG does not require it to use signage to identify its accessible parking space, that space may be used by non-disabled customers as well as by disabled customers. Opp. at 2. Plaintiff does not provide any citation to the contrary. See Reply at 2. Without the benefit of specific briefing, the Court does not find at summary judgment that Defendant's apparent policy of permitting non-disabled customers to utilize the accessible parking space constitutes a barrier to access.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's MSJ on his ADA [*16]  claim based on the width of the parking stall and access aisle, the dumpster and chairs in or around the parking stall on different days, the placement of the van accessible sign, and the fact that cars without disabled persons placards were parked in the accessible parking space.
The Court proceeds to examine whether regrading the slope of the parking space and access aisle is readily achievable.

D. Removal of the Architectural Barriers
Removal of a barrier is "readily achievable" if said removal is "easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense." 42 U.S.C. § 12181(9). In determining whether removal of a barrier is readily achievable, the Court must consider the following the following four factors:
A) the nature and cost of the action needed under this chapter; B) the overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the action; the number of persons employed at such facility; the effect on expenses and resources, or the impact otherwise of such action upon the operation of the facility; C) the overall financial resources of the covered entity; the overall size of the business of a covered entity with respect to the number of its employees; the number, [*17]  type, and location of its facilities; and D) the type of operation or operations of the covered entity, including the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce of such entity; the geographic separateness, administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity.
Hubbard v. Rite Aid Corp., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1168 (S.D. Cal. 2006) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12181(9)).
The Ninth Circuit recently adopted a burden-shifting framework to determine who bears the burden of proving that removal of an architectural barrier is readily achievable. Lopez v. Catalina Channel Express, Inc., 974 F.3d 1030, 1035 (9th Cir. 2020). Plaintiffs must first "plausibly show how the cost of removing the architectural barrier at issue does not exceed the benefits under the circumstances." Id. at 1038. The burden then shifts to the defendant "to counter the plaintiff's initial showing, and at that point the district court is required under the statute to weigh each of the § 12181(9) factors to determine whether removal of the architectural barrier is readily achievable or not." Id. at 1039.
Plaintiff has met his initial burden. A general contractor with 32 years of experience estimated that it would cost $1,768 to resurface the accessible parking space and restripe the parking space and access aisle. The benefit of doing so is to bring Defendant into strict [*18]  compliance with the ADAAG. See Chapman I, 631 F.3d at 945 ("'[O]bedience to the spirit of the ADA' does not excuse noncompliance with the ADAAG's requirements." (quoting Long v. Coast Resorts, Inc., 267 F.3d 918, 923 (9th Cir. 2001)).
To counter Plaintiff's showing, Defendant argues that the grading in the area behind the store is necessary for the City-mandated grease interceptor. Opp. at 2. Defendant provides little detail about this grease interceptor or any of the 42 U.S.C. section 12181(9) factors. It is also unclear how resurfacing the parking lot to account for minor inclines in one corner of the lot would affect the grease interceptor. Although weighing the section 12181(9) factors "involves a fact intensive inquiry that will rarely be decided on summary judgment," Defendant has not provided enough evidence to meet its burden of persuasion to show that resurfacing and restriping the parking lot is not readily achievable. Wilson v. Pier 1 Imports (US), Inc., 439 F. Supp. 2d 1054, 1067 (E.D. Cal. 2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that bringing the slope of the accessible parking space into ADA compliance is readily achievable. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment to Plaintiff on his ADA cause of action against Defendant as to the slope of the accessible parking space. Plaintiff therefore may obtain injunctive [*19]  relief regarding the removal of that barrier only. See Vogel, 992 F. Supp. 2d at 1015.

V.

CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's MSJ against Defendant as to the ADA violation relating to the slope of the accessible parking space but DENIES the MSJ as to any other of his ADA claims based on the width of the parking stall and access aisle, the dumpster and chairs in the parking stall on different days, the placement of the van accessible sign, and the fact that cars without disabled persons placards were parked in the accessible parking space. Plaintiff shall submit the proposed judgment within one week of this Order.
