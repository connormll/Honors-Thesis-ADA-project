CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: IN CHAMBERS — COURT ORDER
Before the Court is a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by defendant United Parcel Service, Inc. ("UPS" or "Defendant") (Docket No. 28). Also before the Court is a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by plaintiff Roberto Ayon ("Ayon" or "Plaintiff") (Docket No. 29). Pursuant to Rule 78 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7-15, the Court finds that these matters are appropriate for decision without oral argument. The hearing calendared for March 18, 2019, is vacated, and the matters taken off calendar.

I. Factual and Procedural Background
Plaintiff filed his Complaint in this Court on May 25, 2018. The Complaint alleges claims for: (1) disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"); (2) disability discrimination in violation [*2]  of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (3) failure to accommodate under the ADA; (4) failure to accommodate under FEHA; (5) failure to engage in the interactive process under FEHA; (6) retaliation and interference under the ADA; (7) retaliation and interference under FEHA; and (8) unlawful business practices under California Business and Professions Code section 17200.
UPS hired Ayon as a temporary, seasonal employee in October 1999. Ayon became a permanent part-time employee at the UPS sorting facility in Van Nuys in January 2000. Ayon was born deaf and communicates through American Sign Language ("ASL"). Ayon does not speak English, and although he stated in documents he submitted to UPS around the time of his hiring that he read newspapers, he now asserts that he is not proficient in reading or writing English.
Ayon worked for UPS as a sorter until February 10, 2016, when he was terminated for violating UPS's "zero tolerance" workplace violence policy after he was involved in an altercation with a co-worker, Irrek Bowman ("Bowman"), on the night of February 8, 2016. UPS's workplace violence policy states: "We have zero tolerance for workplace violence, and we will investigate and take appropriate action up to and including [*3]  dismissal regarding any threats to a safe workplace." UPS's collective bargaining agreement with Ayon's union permitted UPS to immediately terminate an employee for "unprovoked assault on an employee or a supervisory employee while on duty." During the February 8, 2016 incident involving Ayon and Bowman, Ayon was observed by witnesses, including a security guard, retrieving an item from his car, which Ayon admits was his child's metal baseball bat, and approaching Bowman while yelling aggressively. Bowman, the security guard, and the security guard's supervisor submitted written reports following the incident. Ayon, who consulted with a representative from his union, was provided with an opportunity to submit a statement but initially declined to do so.
UPS provided Ayon with an ASL interpreter for the disciplinary hearing it conducted on February 10, 2016. Although Ayon states in his declaration submitted in support of his Opposition to UPS's Motion for Summary Judgment that he "explained what happened at the parking lot," he does not provide any evidence concerning what he specifically told UPS before he was discharged for violating the workplace violence policy. In his Complaint [*4]  and in support of his Opposition to UPS's Motion for Summary Judgment, Ayon states that Bowman brandished a multi-tool with a blade during the encounter in the parking lot. However, the witness statements do not indicate that Bowman brandished a weapon or made any threatening gestures, and there is no evidence that those who made the decision on behalf of UPS to discharge Ayon were aware of Ayon's accusations against Bowman at the time they made the decision to terminate Ayon and suspend Bowman for a day.
During his time at UPS, Plaintiff periodically requested that he be provided with an ASL interpreter. Some of Plaintiff's supervisors arranged for ASL interpreters, but Plaintiff states that the supervisors he had beginning in 2014 did not make interpreters available on a regular basis, and that UPS did not provide ASL interpreters for certain safety and other meetings UPS required him to attend. Plaintiff also claims that some safety videos he was required to watch included English captions, but his limited English proficiency made it difficult for him to understand these videos. Plaintiff testified during his deposition, however, that he understood UPS's zero tolerance workplace [*5]  violence policy.
Plaintiff alleges that he exhausted his administrative remedies by filing a complaint with the EEOC in April 2016, which was cross-filed with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, and that he received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC on February 28, 2018.

II. Legal Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) authorizes summary judgment if no genuine issue exists regarding any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The moving party must show an absence of an issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party does so, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 324. The court does "not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter, but only determines whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Balint v. Carson City, 180 F.3d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir 1999). A "'scintilla of evidence,' or evidence that is 'merely colorable' or 'not significantly probative,'" does not present a genuine issue of material fact. United Steelworkers of Am. v. Phelps Dodge Corp., 865 F.2d 1539, 1542 (9th Cir), cert denied, 493 U.S. 809, 110 S. Ct. 51, 107 L. Ed. 2d 20 (1989) (emphasis in original, citation omitted).
The substantive law governing a claim or defense determines whether a fact is material. T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 631-32 (9th Cir 1987). The court must view the inferences drawn from the facts "in the light most favorable [*6]  to the nonmoving party." Id. at 631 (citation omitted). Thus, reasonable doubts about the existence of a factual issue should be resolved against the moving party. Id. at 630-31. However, when the non-moving party's claims are factually "implausible, that party must come forward with more persuasive evidence than would otherwise be [required] . . . ." California Architectural Bldg. Prods., Inc. v. Franciscan Ceramics, Inc., 818 F.2d 1466, 1468 (9th Cir 1987), cert denied, 484 U.S. 1006, 108 S. Ct. 698, 98 L. Ed. 2d 650 (1988) (citation omitted). "No longer can it be argued that any disagreement about a material issue of fact precludes the use of summary judgment." Id. "[T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S. Ct. at 2552.

III. UPS's Motion for Summary Judgment
UPS contends that Ayon's first and second claims for disability discrimination under the ADA and FEHA, and sixth and seventh claims for retaliation and interference under the ADA and FEHA, fail because there is no dispute that UPS had a legitimate, non-pretextual, and nondiscriminatory reason to terminate Plaintiff as a result his violation of the workplace [*7]  violence policy. UPS asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's third and fourth claims for failure to accommodate under the ADA and FEHA, and fifth claim for failure to engage in the interactive process under FEHA, because UPS's alleged failures to accommodate or engage in the interactive process did not cause Plaintiff to suffer an adverse employment action or other harm. UPS argues that Plaintiff's unlawful business practices claim fails because the underlying claims have no merit and no equitable remedies are available or appropriate. Finally, UPS seeks summary judgment on Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages because, according to UPS, Plaintiff lacks evidence that UPS acted with malice, fraud, or oppression.

A. Claims for Disability Discrimination and Retaliation and Interference
Ayon's first and second claims for disability discrimination under the ADA and FEHA, and sixth and seventh claims for retaliation and interference under the ADA and FEHA, all require application of the three-stage burden-shifting test established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1093 (9th Cir. 2001) (applying McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting to ADA disability discrimination claim); Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal.4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 378, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (applying McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting [*8]  to FEHA disability discrimination claim); Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1186-87 (9th Cir. 2003) (applying McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting to ADA retaliation claim); Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 444, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005) (applying McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting to FEHA retaliation claim).
In applying the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, first, the plaintiff must demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination; second, if the plaintiff succeeds, the defendant must "articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for its actions; finally, if the defendant meets its burden, the plaintiff must demonstrate "that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination." See Texas Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1093, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1991); McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S. Ct. at 1824, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668. "Although intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back and forth under this framework, '[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.'" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 2106, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, 101 S. Ct. at 1093).
The degree of proof to demonstrate a prima facie case is minimal, and does not need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence. Coghlan v. Am. Seafoods Co., LLC., 413 F.3d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir. 2005).
If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory [*9]  reason for the employment decision. Although the burden of production shifts to the defendant at this point, the burden of proof remains with the plaintiff at all times. If the employer offers a nondiscriminatory reason, the burden returns to the plaintiff to show that the articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination.
Leong v. Potter, 347 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). A plaintiff may demonstrate pretext either directly, by persuading the Court that discrimination most likely motivated the defendant, or indirectly, by showing that the defendant's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir. 1998). An explanation is considered unworthy of credence if it is internally inconsistent or otherwise not believable. Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Tr., 225 F.3d 1115, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 363, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 380 ("[I]n an appropriate case, an inference of dissembling may arise where the employer has given shifting, contradictory, implausible, uninformed, or factually baseless justifications for its actions."). However, bare assertions of "discriminatory motivation and intent . . . are inadequate, without substantial factual evidence, to raise an issue precluding summary judgment." Steckl v. Motorola, Inc., 703 F.2d 392, 393 (9th Cir. 1983); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 362, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 384-85 ("[S]ummary judgment for the employer may . . . be appropriate where, given the strength of the employer's showing of innocent reasons, [*10]  any countervailing circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motive, even if it may technically constitute a prima facie case, is too weak to raise a rational inference that discrimination occurred."); see also Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148 ("For instance, an employer would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred."); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 362, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 384.
Here, the parties do not dispute that Plaintiff suffers from a disability, that he was qualified for the position, that, at least with respect to his termination, he suffered an adverse employment action, or that UPS's workplace violence policy may, in appropriate circumstances, provide a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for discharge. The parties do dispute, however, if Plaintiff has established a genuine disputed fact concerning whether UPS's application of its workplace violence policy was pretextual.
Plaintiff contends that he has succeeded in raising triable issues of fact concerning pretext [*11]  because Bowman, who does not have a hearing impairment, received only a one-day suspension, while Plaintiff, who is deaf, was discharged. As the Court has noted, however, the third-party witnesses saw Plaintiff brandish an object and yell, but did not report that Bowman was similarly threatening. Nor has Plaintiff presented the Court with evidence that UPS knew at the time of its disciplinary decisions, that Plaintiff was accusing Bowman of threatening him with a multi-tool. These after-the-fact allegations simply do not create a triable issue of fact that UPS's enforcement of the workplace violence policy was pretext for discrimination or in any way motivated by Plaintiff's requests that UPS occasionally provide him with an ASL interpreter. Instead, Plaintiff admits that, despite having been informed of and understanding UPS's workplace violence policy, he grabbed his child's metal baseball bat from his car and held it while engaged in an altercation with Bowman. See Vasquez v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 641 (9th Cir. 2003) (upholding grant of summary judgment where the allegedly similarly-situated employees "did not engage in problematic conduct of comparable seriousness").
In an additional effort to create a genuine factual dispute concerning [*12]  pretext, Plaintiff contends that UPS's investigation into the incident that resulted in his discharge was rushed and shoddy. However, even if Plaintiff could poke some holes in the witness statements and evidence upon which UPS relied in reaching its decision to discharge him, an effort that is refuted by Plaintiff's admissions concerning his own conduct, such an attack is "unavailing" because, in judging whether an employer's "proffered justification were 'false,' it is not important whether they were objectively false . . . . Rather, courts 'only require that an employer honestly believed its reason for its actions, even if its reason is 'foolish or trivial or even baseless.'" Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1063 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Johnson v. Nordstrom, Inc., 260 F.3d 727, 733 (7th Cir. 2001)).
For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to satisfy his burden at the third stage of the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting test to create even a triable issue of fact that UPS's legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for discharging him was pretextual or done to retaliate against Plaintiff or interfere with his exercise of rights under either the ADA or FEHA. The Court therefore grants UPS's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's first, second, sixth, and seventh [*13]  claims.

B. Claims for Failure to Accommodate and Engage in the Interactive Process
UPS contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on Ayon's third and fourth claims for failure to accommodate under the ADA and FEHA, and fifth claim for failure to engage in the interactive process under FEHA, because Ayon cannot establish that he has suffered harm. Contrary to UPS's assertions, the Court concludes that because there is evidence that Plaintiff requested ASL interpreters, and UPS did not provide ASL interpreters for some meetings and at other times, Plaintiff has established the existence of genuine disputed facts that preclude summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA and FEHA claims for failure to accommodate and FEHA claim for failure to engage in the interactive process. See E.E.O.C. v. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, 620 F.3d 1103, 1111 (9th Cir. 2010) ("UPS . . . concedes that its obligation to make reasonable accommodations includes an obligation to provide modifications that enable an employee 'to enjoy the equal benefits and privileges of employment' as other employees, including the benefits and privileges of understanding and participating in such meetings."); id. at 1112 ("[T]here is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether these modifications, viewed as [*14]  a whole, would allow a deaf employee, even one who was fluent in written English, to enjoy the benefits and privileges of attending and participating in the departmental meetings. This is especially true in light of [the deaf employee's] limited proficiency in written English."); see also Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55, 68 (2000) ("[A]ssuming the employee is disabled, the employer cannot prevail on summary judgment on a claim of failure to reasonably accommodate unless it establishes through undisputed facts that . . . reasonable accommodation was offered and refused . . . or . . . the employer did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith. Reviewing the evidence presented in support of an in opposition to summary judgment, it is evident that a factual dispute exists as to whether [the employee] was offered a reasonable accommodation . . . or whether the informal process broke down, and if so, which party was responsible.").
The Court therefore denies UPS's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's third, fourth, and fifth claims.1 The Court additionally concludes that UPS has not established [*15]  as a matter of law that Plaintiff cannot recover punitive damages on these claims. See Commodore Home Sys., Inc. v. Superior Court, 32 Cal. 3d 211, 214-15, 185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 272, 649 P.2d 912 (1982).2

C. Claim for Unlawful Business Practices
The Court's determination that UPS is entitled to summary judgment on Ayon's claims for disability discrimination and retaliation and interference means that UPS's discharge of Ayon was lawful. As a result, UPS is entitled to summary judgment on his unlawful business practices claim brought pursuant to California Business and Professions Code section 17200 because, as a former employee, Ayon has no remaining viable claim for equitable or declaratory relief recognized under section 17200. See Davis v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 245 Cal. App. 4th 1302, 1325-27, 200 Cal. Rptr. 3d 315, 334-45 (2016). Here, because Ayon's discharge was not discriminatory, and he is therefore not entitled to reinstatement, there is no threat that he will experience any allegedly wrongful conduct in the future. Id. at 1327, 200 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 335 ("The injuries appellant suffered at the hands of Farmers are all in the past. Neither at trial nor on appeal has appellant identified any threat of real and immediate future injury to himself as a result of Farmers's employment practices. He is not employed by Farmers, and there is no reasonable likelihood he will be at any time in the future or will otherwise be in a position to be harmed by Farmers's actions."). The Court therefore concludes [*16]  that UPS is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's eighth claim for unfair business practices.

IV. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment
Ayon challenges each of the 38 affirmative defenses asserted in UPS's Answer. The parties dispute the adequacy of the pre-filing meeting of counsel, the applicable pleading standard, and the merits of and evidentiary support for both Plaintiff's Motion and UPS's affirmative defenses. At a minimum, as Plaintiff points out, many of the affirmative defenses alleged in UPS's Answer are not "affirmative defenses" or do not otherwise appear to be legally or factually supported by the record. See Saks v. Franklin Covey Co., 316 F.3d 337, 350 (2nd Cir. 2003) ("An affirmative defense is defined as '[a] defendant's assertion raising new facts and arguments that, if true, will defeat the plaintiff's or prosecution's claim, even if all allegations in the complaint are true.'") (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 430 (7th ed. 1999)).
Nevertheless, because of the "limited importance of pleading in federal practice," see Neilson v. Union Bank of California, N.A., 290 F. Supp. 2d 1101, 1152 (C.D. Cal. 2003), and what the Court views as both parties' failures to engage in a sufficient meet and confer process as required by Local Rule 7-3 to narrow the disputed issues prior to the filing of Plaintiff's Motion, the Court does [*17]  not believe that resolution of the issues raised in Plaintiff's Motion is necessary or advisable at this time. As the Court noted in its September 5, 2018 Minute Order that the Court is "highly unlikely" to provide the parties with the 5 to 7 days they estimated for trial in their Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f) Joint Report. The Court's statement is even more true now that the Court has narrowed the claims Plaintiff may pursue at trial. Even if all 38 of UPS's asserted affirmative defenses were in fact cognizable affirmative defenses, and UPS had evidence to support them, the parties must make choices as to how much of their limited trial time they will devote to these matters and present to the jury. The record in support of and in opposition to Plaintiff's Motion makes clear that neither party has begun to think realistically about these issues.
The Court therefore denies Plaintiff's Motion without prejudice to these issues being raised again at the pretrial conference. In the interim, the Court orders the parties to meet and confer concerning which, if any, actual affirmative defenses UPS will pursue at trial. In addition to the proposed Pretrial Conference Order, the parties shall file a separate Joint Report [*18]  in which they explain what additional efforts they have undertaken to narrow the issues related to UPS's affirmative defenses, and which, if any, affirmative defenses UPS intends to pursue at trial. That Joint report shall be filed at the same time as the parties are required to lodge the proposed Pretrial Conference Order. Conclusion
For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that UPS is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's first, second, sixth, seventh, and eighth claims. Having concluded, however, that triable issues of fact exist concerning Plaintiff's third, fourth, and fifth claims, the Court denies UPS's Motion for Summary Judgment as to those claims. The Court denies Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
