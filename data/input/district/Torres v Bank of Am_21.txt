ORDER re: Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Complaint [9]
Plaintiff Jamie Torres ("Plaintiff") brings this Action asserting six causes of action related to discrimination on the basis of disability against Defendant Bank of America, National Association ("Defendant"). Currently before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Complaint ("Motion") [9]. Having reviewed all papers submitted pertaining to this Motion, the Court NOW FINDS AND RULES AS FOLLOWS: GRANTS Defendant's Motion.

I. BACKGROUND

A. Factual Background
Plaintiff is a California resident. Attachment B to Notice of Removal, Ex. B. ("Compl.") Compl. ¶ 1, ECF. No. 1-2. Defendant is a citizen of North Carolina. Notice of Removal ¶ 9, ECF No. 1.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant subjected Plaintiff to harassment, discrimination, and retaliation on the basis of disability, perceived disability, request for and exercise of reasonable accommodation, request for and exercise of medical leave, and opposition to discrimination to Defendant's management [*2]  and human resources. Compl. ¶ 6. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant failed to engage in good faith in the interactive process and provide reasonable accommodation for Plaintiff's disabilities. Id. ¶ 7. Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant: failed to follow Plaintiff's doctor's restrictions; required Plaintiff not take his needed breaks; failed to provide Plaintiff with a modified work schedule and location; affirmatively interfered in Plaintiff's ability to comply with his doctor's instructions; scheduled appointments during Plaintiff's medical appointments; announced Plaintiff was taking time off of work; appointed another person to assume Plaintiff's job responsibilities; diminished Plaintiff's position and duties; subjected Plaintiff to increased scrutiny; reduced Plaintiff's compensation and failed to pay his annual bonus; failed to increase; failed to provide a merit increase; subjected Plaintiff to false/pretextual write ups and evaluations; set Plaintiff up for failure; solicited negative feedback; failed to follow policies; and failed to investigate. Id. ¶ 8.
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's conduct constitutes disparate impact and disparate treatment discrimination. [*3]  Id. ¶ 9. Moreover, Plaintiff maintains that Defendant acted with oppression, malice, and/or conscious disregard of Plaintiff's rights. Id. ¶ 15. Plaintiff alleges that he has suffered damages in the form of loss of earnings and benefits. Id. ¶ 13. Plaintiff also asserts that he has suffered from humiliation, emotional distress and mental pain and anguish.
Plaintiff states that he has received a Right to Sue letter from the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment and has thus exhausted all necessary administrative remedies. Id. ¶ 10.

B. Procedural Background
Plaintiff filed his Complaint [1-2] in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, on May 14, 2020, alleging causes of action related to discrimination on the basis of disability.1 Defendant removed the Action to this Court on June 17, 2020 [1].
Defendant filed the instant Motion [9] on June 23, 2020. Plaintiff opposed [10] on July 14, 2020, and Defendant timely replied [11] on July 21, 2020.

II. DISCUSSION

A. Legal Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows a party to move for dismissal of one or more claims if the pleading fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A complaint must "contain [*4]  sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quotation omitted). Dismissal is warranted for a "lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory." Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988) (citation omitted).
In ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion, a court may generally consider only allegations contained in the pleadings, exhibits attached to the complaint, and matters properly subject to judicial notice. Swartz v. KPMG LLP, 476 F.3d 756, 763 (9th Cir. 2007). A court must presume all factual allegations of the complaint to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Klarfeld v. United States, 944 F.2d 583, 585 (9th Cir. 1991). The question is not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the plaintiff is entitled to present evidence to support the claims. Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 184, 125 S. Ct. 1497, 161 L. Ed. 2d 361 (2005) (quoting Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1974)). While a complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff must provide more than "labels and conclusions" or "a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). However, a complaint "should not be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) 'unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.'" Balistreri, 901 F.2d at 699 (citing Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957)).

B. Discussion
1. Exhaustion [*5]  of Administrative Remedies
In order to bring a civil action under FEHA, "a claimant must exhaust his or her administrative remedies." See Dornell v. City of San Mateo, 19 F. Supp. 3d 900, 905 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Rodriguez v. Airborne Express, 265 F.3d 890, 896 (9th Cir. 2001)). To properly exhaust administrative remedies, a plaintiff must, before initiating suit, file an administrative complaint with the California DFEH within one year of the alleged unlawful conduct and receive a right to sue letter from the agency. See Dornell, 19 F. Supp. 3d at 905 (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(d)). "It is generally a plaintiff's burden to plead and prove timely exhaustion of administrative remedies, such as filing a sufficient complaint with the [DFEH] and obtaining a right-to-sue letter." Garcia v. Los Banos Unified Sch. Dist., 418 F. Supp. 2d 1194, 1215 (E.D. Cal. 2006).
To sufficiently plead exhaustion, a plaintiff need not attach a copy of the right to sue letter to his complaint. See Watkins v. City of Moreno Valley, No. E:CV-171424-DMG-KKX, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 229520, 2018 WL 6265100, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2018). Nor must a plaintiff specifically allege that he named the defendant in the charges with the DFEH. See Wells v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., No. 15-CV-01700-SI, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150595, 2015 WL 6746820, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 2015). Instead, "[c]ourts have found sufficient complaints alleging only that a plaintiff exhausted his or her remedies by timely filing charges of discrimination with and receiving right-to-sue letters from the DFEH . . . ."  [*6] Fitch v. S.F. Unified Sch. Dist., No. 15-CV-02769-SI, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147055, 2015 WL 6551668, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 29, 2015).
Here, Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that "Plaintiff has received a Right to Sue letter from the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment and has thus exhausted all necessary administrative remedies." This allegation is sufficient to meet the liberal pleading requirements of Rule 8. See Davis v. Blazin Wings, Inc., No. EDCV16-2167-JGB(KKX), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193818, 2016 WL 10966411, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 1, 2016) (finding the plaintiff sufficiently pled exhaustion of administrative remedies where he stated "in his Complaint that he 'received a Right to Sue letter from the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment' and has therefore exhausted all necessary administrative remedies").
2. Count One: Discrimination in Violation of FEHA
Plaintiff's first claim is for discrimination in violation of FEHA. To state a claim for discrimination on the basis of disability under FEHA, Plaintiff must allege that: "(1) Plaintiff suffers from a disability; (2) Plaintiff is otherwise qualified to do his job; and (3) Plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action because of his disability." Alejandro v. ST Micro Elecs., Inc, 129 F. Supp. 3d 898, 907 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (citing Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830, 836 (Ct. App. 1997); Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir. 2001)).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for disability discrimination under FEHA because Plaintiff fails to allege: (1) he has a FEHA-qualified [*7]  disability; (2) he was otherwise qualified to perform his job; and (3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action because of his disability. Mot. 12:25-13:2, ECF No. 9.
Here, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of FEHA. First, Plaintiff has failed to allege any facts specifying his disability. Plaintiff merely states that "Defendants subjected Plaintiff to harassment/discrimination/retaliation on the bases [sic] of disability," Compl. ¶ 6, and "Defendant failed to engage in good faith in the interactive process and provide reasonable accommodation for Plaintiff's disabilities," id. ¶ 7. Nowhere does the Complaint specify what physical or mental disability Plaintiff suffers from, nor whether the disability limits a major life activity. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926.1 (noting the various physical and mental disabilities that qualify under FEHA). Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead the first element of discrimination on the basis of disability under FEHA. Contra Alejandro, 129 F. Supp. 3d at 908 (holding the plaintiff properly alleged he suffered from a disability for the purposes of FEHA where the plaintiff alleged that he suffered bipolar disorder, [*8]  generalized anxiety disorder, and debilitating allergies that limited his ability to move and communicate effectively).
Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff failed to state a claim for discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of FEHA and GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Count One of the Complaint.
3. Count Two: Failure to Prevent Discrimination in Violation of FEHA
Plaintiff's second cause of action is for failure to prevent discrimination in violation of FEHA. Generally, an employer must not "fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940. But, "[e]mployers should not be held liable to employees for failure to take necessary steps to prevent discriminatory conduct, except where such conduct took place and was not prevented." Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596, 602 (Ct. App. 1998). Accordingly, "stating a claim for failure to prevent discrimination relies on adequately alleging a claim for discrimination." Davis, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193818, 2016 WL 10966411, at *6.
Here, because Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for discrimination on the basis of disability, it necessarily follows that Plaintiff's claim for failure to prevent discrimination must fail. See id. (finding the plaintiff's claim for failure to prevent discrimination [*9]  was deficiently plead because the plaintiff failed to state a claim for discrimination). Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion as it pertains to Count Two.
4. Counts Three and Four: Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process and Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation in Violation of FEHA
Plaintiff's third and fourth causes of action are for failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to provide reasonable accommodation.
FEHA requires employers "'to engage in a timely, good faith, and interactive process with [a disabled] employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodations by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition.'" Griffith v. Logisticare Sols., LLC, CV 16-8666-PSG-JEMx, 2017 WL 8222609, at *7 (C.D. Cal. June 15, 2017) (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n)).
To establish a failure to make reasonable accommodation claim, a plaintiff must allege: (1) he has a disability covered by the FEHA; (2) he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position; and (3) the defendant failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. Tipton v. Airport Terminal Servs., Inc., No. CV:18-09503-AB-JEMX, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166498, 2019 WL 4231235, at *9 (C.D. Cal. June 25, 2019) (citing Hernandez v. Rancho Santiago Cmty. Coll. Dist., 22 Cal. App. 5th 1187, 232 Cal. Rptr. 3d 349, 353 (Ct. App. 2018)). To state a claim for [*10]  failure to provide reasonable accommodation, "an employer must have been aware of the employee's disability." Tipton, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166498, 2019 WL 4231235, at *9 (citing King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359, 374 (2007)).
As discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to establish that he has a disability covered by FEHA. Moreover, Plaintiff's Complaint is completely devoid of facts showing that he was qualified to perform his job with reasonable accommodation. See Weaver v. Bimbo Bakeries, USA, Inc., No. 2:18-cv-00303-MCE-EFB, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54696, 2019 WL 1426327, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2019) (granting a motion to dismiss a failure to accommodate claim where the plaintiff's complaint was "devoid of factual allegations that he was physically able to return to work with reasonable accommodation, or that he could perform the essential job functions as a delivery person, or that he could have worked in an alternate position," or "which working conditions or essential duties made working as a delivery person 'intolerable or impossible' for Plaintiff, or what particular conduct by Defendant constitutes a failure to reasonably accommodate"). Instead, Plaintiff here merely makes a conclusory allegation that "Defendant failed to engage in good faith in the interactive process and provide reasonable accommodation for Plaintiffs disabilities," Compl. ¶ 7, without any facts [*11]  supporting such conclusions. See Walls v. Kiewit Corp., No. CV:19-8319-PSG-JEMX, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 230735, 2019 WL 8685070, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 17, 2019) (granting motion to dismiss failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process claims where the complaint made conclusory allegations that "Defendant failed and refused to accommodate Plaintiff's needs" and "Plaintiff was qualified for the position of employment that he held with Defendant and was able to perform the essential functions of that job if such reasonable accommodation had been made by Defendant").
Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for failure to accommodate or failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA. Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Counts Three and Four of Plaintiff's Complaint.
5. Count Five: Retaliation in Violation of FEHA
Plaintiff's fifth cause of action is for retaliation in violation of FEHA. FEHA provides it is unlawful for "any employer, labor organization, employment agency, or person to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted [*12]  in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). To state a claim for retaliation under FEHA, a plaintiff must show that "(1) she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected her to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Day v. Sears Holdings Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1176 (C.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Miller v. Dep't of Corr., 36 Cal. 4th 446, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 115 P.3d 77, 94 (Cal. 2005)).
Here, Plaintiff has failed to allege that he engaged in any activity protected by FEHA. See Griffith v. Logisticare Sols., LLC, No. CV:16-8666-PSG-JEMX, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 223339, 2017 WL 8220435, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 9, 2017) (finding the plaintiff's allegation of protected activity "deficient because it [was] conclusory and lacking in factual support" where the plaintiff did "not assert when she filed the complaints, who she filed them with, or how regularly she filed complaints"). Moreover, while Plaintiff alleges that Defendant "reduced Plaintiff's compensation, failed to pay his annual bonus, failed to increase his pay, reduced his annual award, failed to provide a merit increase, [and] subjected Plaintiff to false/pretextual write ups/evaluations," Compl. ¶ 8, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that any link existed between any protected activity and adverse employment action. See Walls, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 230735, 2019 WL 8685070, at *6 (holding plaintiff failed to allege that a casual link existed between [*13]  the protected activity and the adverse employment actions where the plaintiff alleged that it was communicated to him that "management decided to terminate him," but did not "allege any facts indicating who decided to terminate him, or whether that person knew of any allegedly protected activity").
Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for retaliation in violation of FEHA. As such, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion with respect to Count Five of the Complaint.
6. Count Six: Violation of CFRA
Plaintiff's sixth claim is for violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"). CFRA is the section of FEHA "intended to protect employees from suffering adverse employment consequences when they must take leave from work for certain personal or family medical reasons." Griffith, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 223339, 2017 WL 8220435, at *6; Davis, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193818, 2016 WL 10966411, at *8. To make out a prima facie case for a violation of CFRA, a plaintiff must allege: "'(1) the defendant was an employer covered by CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination . . . [*14]  , because of her exercise of her right to CFRA leave.'" Id. (quoting Dudley v. Dep't of Transp., 90 Cal. App. 4th 255, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 739, 744 (Ct. App. 2001).
Here, Plaintiff's Complaint fails to allege any of the elements of a CFRA violation. He fails to allege whether Defendant was covered by CFRA, whether he was eligible for CFRA leave, whether he exercised his right to such leave, and whether he suffered an adverse employment action because he took CFRA leave. "At this point, Plaintiff's entitlement to relief under the CFRA is purely speculative." Davis, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193818, 2016 WL 10966411, at *8 (dismissing the plaintiff's claim for violation of CFRA leave where there were no allegations in the complaint that allowed the court "to determine whether Defendants are employers covered by the CFRA, whether Plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave, whether Plaintiff actually exercised the right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose, or whether or not an adverse employment action was taken as a result of Plaintiff's exercise of his right to CFRA leave"). As such, the Court finds that Plaintiff failed to state a claim for violation of CFRA and GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Count Six of the Complaint.
7. Leave to Amend
A party may amend its complaint once "as a matter of course" before a responsive pleading [*15]  is served. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). After that, a "party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave." Id. "The court should freely give leave when justice so requires." Id. The Ninth Circuit has noted that leave to amend lies "within the sound discretion of the trial court." United States v. Webb, 655 F.2d 977, 979 (9th Cir. 1981). However, "leave to amend need not be granted when 'any amendment would be an exercise in futility.'" Hoang v. Bank of America, N.A., 910 F.3d 1096, 1103 (9th Cir. 2018) (citations omitted).
Here, Plaintiff requests leave to amend his Complaint should the Court grant Defendant's Motion. See Opp'n 4:20-21, ECF No. 10. The Court GRANTS leave to amend the Complaint in its entirety because amendment would not necessarily be futile.

III. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion. Plaintiff shall have twenty-one (21) days from the date of this Order to file any amended complaint.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
