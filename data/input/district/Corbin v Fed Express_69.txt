Opinion



OPINION AND ORDER
On March 9, 2016, pro se plaintiff Jeffrey P. Corbin ("Corbin") filed a second amended complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 et seq., and 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., alleging that defendant Federal Express ("FedEx") violated the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 6. On January 10, 2017, FedEx filed a motion seeking summary judgment on each of Corbin's claims. Def. Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 49. For the reasons that follow, FedEx's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
FedEx answered the second amended complaint on April 4, 2016. ECF No. 10. On May 23, 2016, both parties consented to proceed before the undersigned, in accordance [*2]  with 28 U.S.C. § 636(c) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73. ECF No. 20. A jury trial was set for December 13, 2016. ECF No. 21. With Corbin's consent, FedEx moved to continue the trial date and all pretrial deadlines, and the Court continued the trial date to March 7, 2017. ECF Nos. 41, 46, 47. Corbin filed an opposition to FedEx's motion for summary judgment on February 13, 2017. Pl. Resp. to Def. Summ. J., ECF No. 57. On February 16, 2017, FedEx filed a reply to Corbin's opposition. Def. Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 59. On February 22, 2017, the Court removed the case from the trial calendar, pending resolution of the motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 65. With permission from the Court, Corbin railed certain opposition documents on March 1, 2017 (ECF Nos. 67, 68) and March 3, 2017 (ECF Nos. 70, 71). See also Order dated Feb. 24, 2017, ECF No. 66. FedEx responded on March 3, 2017. ECF No. 69.
The Court heard oral argument on the motion for summary judgment on March 7, 2017. ECF No. 72. Patrick Riederer, Esq., Catherine Walsh, Esq., and Michael Ward, Esq., represented FedEx. Corbin appeared pro se. The official court reporter was Jody Stewart.

II. THE COMPLAINT
In August 2014, Corbin, a former FedEx employee, filed [*3]  a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). The EEOC issued Corbin a right-to-sue letter in September 2015. Corbin then brought suit in this Court for employment discrimination pursuant to Title VII and the ADA. Corbin's second amended complaint alleges that FedEx engaged in discriminatory conduct on the basis of race and disability, namely, termination of his employment and failure to accommodate his disability.1 ECF No. 6 at 4-5.
Specifically, Corbin, who is black, alleges that he "worked great" for FedEx for 21 years, but encountered problems when he moved to the Norfolk ramp facility and began working with Tom Scott ("Scott"), a white FedEx employee. Id. at 3. Corbin states that Scott "started gunning for [him] not long after [he] got there." Id. Allegedly, Scott verbally abused Corbin, bullied Corbin constantly, "made threats and created safety issues to harass [Corbin]," and "made up lies, mounted an attack and manipulated other people to support him." Id. at 5.
Corbin thought that Scott "viewed himself as being superior to [Corbin]," and that Scott's conduct "might be due to [Corbin's] race and disability." Id. at 4. Corbin apparently complained to Mark Clatterbuck [*4]  ("Clatterbuck"), his white manager, but Clatterbuck "did nothing about it except to take sides with Tom Scott and work with him to make up something to get rid of [Corbin]." Id. Corbin felt that Clatterbuck "rewarded and protected" Scott's "discrimination" and that Scott, "a more healthy, white-coworker . . . was being favored over [him]." Id. Corbin claims that he complained to Mary Davin, his human resources representative, but that "nothing was done." Id.
Corbin further alleges that Clatterbuck and Scott "purposefully misinterpreted" a work order "to pretend that they had a reason to fire [him]." Id. Corbin claims that the "work order practice," which he describes as involving changes to a work order while a unit is at an outside vendor when the vendor decides to perform additional work, "is a very common practice," but "no other people were ever disciplined for it." Id. Corbin alleges that "the only reason [he was] called out on [the work order issue] is because [he is] black and disabled." Id. According to the complaint, Corbin "feel[s] the real reason that [he] was terminated was because of [his] race and [his] disability." Id.

III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The Court now summarizes the [*5]  facts of this case, construing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.2 Pertinent factual disputes are noted and evaluated further below, as part of the Court's analysis.

1. Corbin's employment with FedEx
Corbin began his employment with FedEx in April 1992. Pl. Dep. 11:2-5, ECF No. 59-1 at 5. He started as a material handler before working as a driver for approximately 12 years. Pl. Dep. 11:6-21. In 2005, Corbin became a global vehicle technician in Connecticut. Pl. Dep. 11:18-25. In 2007, he transferred to a FedEx station in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Pl. Dep. 13:11-14; ECF No. 50-1 at 5. In 2013, Corbin transferred to FedEx's ramp facility in Norfolk, Virginia, where he worked as a senior global vehicle technician. Pl. Dep. 13:24-14:1, 16:7-24. FedEx global vehicle technicians are responsible for:
repairing, modifying, and troubleshooting FedEx field vehicles and ground support equipment; diagnosing the source of trouble, disassembling equipment and performing repairs to FedEx vehicles and equipment; performing preventative maintenance on FedEx vehicles and equipment; and completing the required paperwork for each assignment, including Shop Floor Inventory/Timecard documentation. [*6] 
Clatterbuck Decl. 115, ECF No. 50-2 at 2. See also ECF No. 50-2 at 6-8 (copy of job description from FedEx online system).

2. FedEx policies
According to FedEx policy, if a vehicle requires repair by an outside vendor, the global vehicle technician must open a repair order. Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 6. If the repair cost by an outside vendor exceeds $1,000.00, a manager must approve the repair. Id.; Pl. Dep. 45:1-15.3
As a senior global vehicle technician, Corbin was required to complete a time card on a daily basis. The time card included a certification that states:
I hereby certify that all information contained on this time card is accurate and correct. I also understand the applicable policies and procedures for completion of this Company Document. Falsification is a serious offense and grounds for discipline up to and including termination.
ECF No. 59-1 at 9; Pl. Dep. 55:2-7. Falsification of time cards is also addressed in FedEx's Time Card Policy, contained in the "People Manual," which states, "falsification of one's own time card or electronic record is a serious offense and may result in termination under the Acceptable Conduct Policy (2-5)."4 Time Card Policy, ECF No. 50-3 [*7]  at 16; Davin Decl. ¶ 6, ECF No. 50-3 at 2.

3. The events leading to Corbin's departure from FedEx
On January 24, 2014, Clatterbuck, Corbin's manager, learned that Corbin may have violated FedEx policy when he sent a FedEx truck, "Asset No. 301876," to an outside vendor for repairs. Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 7. Clatterbuck then conducted an investigation into the repairs performed on that vehicle. As part of the investigation, Clatterbuck reviewed Corbin's January 17, 2014 time card. Id. at ¶ 9. Clatterbuck also contacted the outside vendor concerning the repairs to Asset No. 301876 and spoke with the vendor foreman. Id. at If 8. On January 28, 2014, Clatterbuck visited the outside vendor and inspected certain parts that had been removed from the vehicle. Id. at ¶ 10. That day, Clatterbuck placed Corbin on investigative suspension. Id. at ¶ 11.
Based on his investigation, Clatterbuck determined that Corbin violated FedEx policy when: (1) he sent Asset No. 301876 to an outside vendor for repairs without opening a repair order; (2) he sent Asset No. 301876 to an outside vendor for repair without Clatterbuck's approval; (3) he falsified his time card, indicating that he performed repairs on Asset [*8]  No. 301876 that he did not perform; and (4) he attempted to coerce an employee of the outside vendor to make false statements regarding the repairs. Id. at ¶ 12.
On February 5, 2014, Clatterbuck and Corbin met to discuss the results of the investigation. Id. at ¶ 13; ECF No. 67. During the meeting, Corbin signed a letter of resignation, effective that day. Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 13; ECF No. 50-2 at 13; ECF No. 67.

4. Corbin's disability and his requests for accommodation
In 1990 or 1991, Corbin was assigned a military disability rating of 20 percent. ECF No. 71 ¶ 25; see also ECF No. 1-2 at 38. Corbin testified during his deposition that his disability was "two knee replacements." Pl. Dep. 30:6-14. According to Corbin, Clatterbuck "knew about [his] disability." ECF No. 71 ¶ 25. Corbin underwent surgery on his right knee in July 2012 and on his left knee in October 2013. Id. at 1129. After his second surgery, he was out of work for approximately two and a half months, and returned in January 2014. Pl. Dep. 32:15-33:4. Corbin provided a note from his surgeon, Dr. Daniel R. Cavazos, to Clatterbuck, indicating that Corbin was returning to work in January with "no restrictions."5 ECF No. 59-1 at 8. See also [*9]  Pl. Dep. 33:20-34:18.
Corbin claims that FedEx failed to accommodate his disability by not providing him two tools that he requested to assist him with his work—a clutch jack dolly and a drum brake dolly. ECF No. 6 at 4; Pl. Dep. 35:3-19. He states that he requested the clutch jack dolly in August, September, and early October of 2013.6 ECF No. 71 ¶ 28. See also id. at ¶ 31. Corbin requested the drum brake dolly "way before" the request for the clutch jack dolly. Pl. Dep. 36:18-19. Both those requests were "denied." Pl. Dep. 35:5-11.
Clatterbuck "intended to order the clutch jack dolly when [Corbin] returned to work from medical leave." Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 14. "[B]efore the tool could be ordered," however, Clatterbuck discovered Corbin's alleged violations of FedEx policies. Id. With respect to the drum brake dolly, Corbin testified that he "found a jack [and] that [he] could work it to where [he] could put it on the brake drums." Pl. Dep. 38:20-22. FedEx construes this statement as indicating that Corbin "did not need the brake dolly he requested, as he utilized a tool already available to him to perform the tasks that the brake dolly would." ECF No. 50 at 23.

IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits [*10]  a party to move for summary judgment and directs a Court to grant such motion "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party "seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the [court] of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (quotations omitted). Subsequently, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to present specific facts demonstrating that a genuine dispute of material fact exists for trial. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) ("When the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56(c), its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts."). For the evidence to present a "genuine" dispute of material fact, it must be "such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). When deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the facts, and inferences to be drawn from [*11]  the facts, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Id. at 255.
A "party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by: (A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or (B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). When ruling on a summary judgment motion, "a court may also give credence to other facts supporting the movant, regardless of their source, if such facts are not challenged by the non-moving party because a failure to challenge proffered facts may render such facts 'admitted.'" XVP Sports, LLC v. Bangs, No. 2:11 cv379, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132446, 2012 WL 4329258, at *4 (ED. Va. Sept. 17, 2012).
As specified in Local Civil Rule 56(B), "the Court may assume that facts identified by the moving party in its listing of [undisputed] material facts are admitted, unless such a fact is controverted in the statement of genuine issues filed in opposition to the motion."  [*12]  E.D.Va. Loc. Civ. R. 56(B). The Court has construed the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff and identified which material facts are, and are not, disputed.

V. ANALYSIS

A. Corbin's suit was timely filed.
The Court first addresses FedEx's claim that Corbin failed to timely file this suit. "Both Title VII and the ADA provide plaintiffs with 'a ninety-day period in which to file their claims after the EEOC has given them a right-to-sue letter.'" Scott v. Hampton City Sch. Bd., No. 4:14cv128, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54823, 2015 WL 1917012, at *2 (E.D. Va. Apr. 27, 2015) (citing Watts-Means v. Prince George's Family Crisis Center, 7 F.3d 40, 42 (4th Cir. 1993); 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a) (incorporating 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5 into the ADA); Morse v. Virginia Dept. of Corrections, No. 3:13cv361, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44756, 2014 WL 1308725, at *6 (E.D. Va. Mar. 31, 2014) (noting that the "the requirement that plaintiffs file suit within 90 days of receipt of [a right to sue] letter are the same for the ADA, . . . Title VII," and other federal employment discrimination statutes)). In determining when this limitations period begins to run, the Fourth Circuit has eschewed an "actual receipt" test in favor of "a flexible rule which requires a case-by-case examination to determine if an equitable tolling of the filing period is appropriate." Harvey v. City of New Bern Police Dep't, 813 F.2d 652, 654 (4th Cir. 1987); see also Watts-Means, 7 F.3d at 42 (finding that the limitations period began when the Postal Service delivered notice to plaintiff that the letter was available for pick [*13]  up rather than the later date of pick up).
Corbin filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, and the EEOC issued him a right-to-sue letter. ECF No. 1-2 at 15, 17, 21. Corbin's amended complaint and second amended complaint state that he received the letter on September 16, 2015. ECF No. 4 at 6; ECF No. 6 at 6. Corbin filed suit on December 18, 2015, 93 days after September 16, 2015. See ECF No. 1. As part of his opposition to the motion for summary judgment, however, Corbin asserts that he received the EEOC's right-to-sue letter—which was mailed on September 16, 2015—on September 19, 2015, making his lawsuit timely. See ECF No. 68; ECF No. 71 at 4, ¶¶ C, 21. Corbin also notes that he received the letter "through the U.S. Mail," which takes one to three days for delivery. ECF No. 71 ¶ 21; see also ECF No. 68.7
FedEx argues that Corbin cannot demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact by contradicting his prior statements in pleadings concerning the date of receipt. ECF No. 59 at 12-13 (citing In re Family Dollar FLSA Litig., 637 F.3d 508, 512 (4th Cir. 2011) ("[I]t is well established that a genuine issue of fact is not created where the only issue of fact is to determine which of the two conflicting versions of a party's testimony is correct.")); [*14]  ECF No. 69 at 2. The Court is not persuaded, however, that the so-called "sham affidavit doctrine" controls assessment of the timeliness issue. Corbin has sworn, before a notary public and under penalty of perjury, that he received the right-to-sue letter on September 19, 2015. ECF Nos. 68, 71. Although his statement contradicts prior representations made to the Court in versions of his complaint, Corbin has not contradicted prior sworn testimony.
In Barwick v. Celotex Corp., the Fourth Circuit explained that "a party who has been examined at length on deposition [cannot] raise an issue of fact simply by submitting an affidavit contradicting his own prior testimony." 736 F.2d 946, 960 (4th Cir. 1984) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court has similarly recognized, but has not endorsed, lower court decisions holding that:
a party cannot create a genuine issue of fact sufficient to survive summary judgment simply by contradicting his or her own previous sworn statement (by, say, filing a later affidavit that flatly contradicts that party's earlier sworn deposition) without explaining the contradiction or attempting to resolve the disparity.
Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 806, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999) (emphasis added). Here, Corbin has not made the type of contradiction identified [*15]  in these cases. See also Simpson-Littman Const., Inc. v. Erie Ins. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., No. CIV.A. 3:09-0240, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95378, 2010 WL 3702601, at *15-17 (S.D.W. Va. Sept. 13, 2010) (finding that the sham affidavit doctrine did not require the court to grant summary judgment even though affidavit statements made in support of plaintiff's opposition to summary judgment contradicted the verified complaint).
Moreover, "[w]hen the date that a potential plaintiff received actual notice of right to sue is disputed or unknown," courts within the Fourth Circuit apply a "presumption that notice was received three days after it was mailed." Panyanouvong v. Vienna Wolftrap Hotel, 525 F. Supp. 2d 793, 796-97 (E.D. Va. 2007) (citing Nguyen v. Inova Alexandria Hosp., 187 F.3d 630, 1999 WL 556446, at *3 (4th Cir. July 30, 1999); Beale v. Burlington Coat Factory, 36 F. Supp. 2d 702, 704 (E.D. Va. 1999); Griffin v. Prince William Hosp. Corp., 716 F. Supp. 919, 922 n.7 (E.D. Va. 1989)). See also Crabill v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Bd of Educ., 423 F. App'x 314, 321 (4th Cir. 2011).
Considering the foregoing, the Court concludes that the 90-day period available to Corbin to bring his claim began on September 19, 2015. Accordingly, Corbin's suit was timely filed.

B. Corbin's Title VII claim
Corbin claims that FedEx discriminated against him on the basis of race when FedEx terminated his employment. ECF No. 6 at 4-5. Pursuant to Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer to "discharge any individual . . . because of such individual's race." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).
To avert summary judgment, a plaintiff can establish discrimination under Title VII "by presenting direct or circumstantial evidence that raises [*16]  a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an impermissible factor such as race motivated the employer's adverse employment decision." Diamond v. Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 318 (4th Cir. 2005) (citing Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., 354 F.3d 277, 284 (4th Cir. 2004)). Alternatively, a plaintiff may proceed by satisfying the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Diamond, 416 F.3d at 318. Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of race-based discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, then the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment action. Id. If the employer does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that the stated reason for the employment action is a pretext for discrimination. Guessous v. Fairview Prop. Investments, LLC, 828 F.3d 208, 216 (4th Cir. 2016) (citing Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-56, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)); Shun-Lung Chao v. Int 7 Bus. Machines Corp., 424 F. App'x 259, 260 (4th Cir. 2011) (citing McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-04).

1. Corbin has not presented direct or circumstantial evidence that race motivated any adverse employment action.
First, the Court considers whether Corbin has presented direct or circumstantial evidence of discrimination sufficient to survive summary judgment Such evidence must "clearly indicate[] a discriminatory attitude at the workplace and must illustrate a nexus between that negative attitude and the employment action." See Brinkley v. Harbour Recreation Club, 180 F.3d 598, 608 (4th Cir. 1999), abrogated on other grounds by Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90, 123 S. Ct. 2148, 156 L. Ed. 2d 84 (2003).
Corbin states that his white [*17]  co-worker, Scott, commented that "[i]t will take someone like [Corbin] thirty years to learn this stuff," sent several harassing a-mails to Corbin, reviewed his work, and bickered with Corbin constantly. E.g., ECF No. 71 ¶ 22; Pl. Dep. 7:2-10:15, 17:2-17, 20:4-22:2, 22:19-23:25. Viewed in the light most favorable to Corbin, these confrontations do not constitute direct or circumstantial evidence of discrimination on the basis of race. To begin, the conduct did not indicate any racist attitudes. Nor did it involve any race-specific comments or actions. Moreover, "statements by nondecisionmakers," do not suffice to satisfy the plaintiffs burden of proving discrimination. Hurst v. District of Columbia, 681 Fed. Appx. 186, 2017 WL 908208, at *6 n.9 (4th Cir., 2017) (citing Hill, 354 F.3d at 286).
Corbin also states that Clatterbuck did not handle the tension with Scott "in a manner that a manager should have," Pl. Dep. 22:8-17, and asserts that Clatterbuck and Scott "purposefully misinterpreted" a work order "to pretend that they had a[] reason to fire [him]." ECF No. 71 ¶ 15(c). Again, however, Corbin has not identified any words or actions that were racial or racially derogatory in nature and has not met his burden of showing "evidence of conduct or statements that both reflect directly the alleged [*18]  discriminatory attitude and that bear directly on the contested employment decision." Taylor v. Virginia Union Univ., 193 F.3d 219, 232 (4th Cir. 1999).

2. Burden-shifting analysis
Second, the Court must also consider the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, which requires that Corbin first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. (a) Corbin has not established a  case of race-based discrimination.
To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge, Corbin must show:
1) that he is a member of a protected class; (2) that he suffered from an adverse employment action; (3) that at the time the employer took the adverse employment action he was performing at a level that met his employer's legitimate expectations; and (4) that the position [remained open or] was filled by a similarly qualified applicant outside the protected class.
King v. Rumsfeld, 328 F.3d 145, 149 (4th Cir. 2003) (citing Brinkley, 180 F.3d at 607). See also Guessaus, 828 F.3d at 219; Holland v. Washington Homes, Inc., 487 F.3d 208, 214 (4th Cir. 2007).

(i) Corbin is a member of a protected class.
With regards to the first element of the prima facie case, FedEx concedes that Corbin, who is black, is a member of a protected class. ECF No. 50 at 21.

(ii) A reasonable jury could find that Corbin suffered an adverse employment action.
Corbin has carried his burden with respect to the second element of his prima facie case. Corbin contends [*19]  that his forced resignation from FedEx constitutes a constructive discharge. E.g., ECF No. 71 ¶ 19. FedEx argues that Corbin voluntarily resigned and, therefore, cannot prove that he suffered an adverse employment action. E.g., ECF No. 50 at 17-18, 21; ECF No. 69 at 3.
Corbin has set forth the following facts concerning the day of his departure from FedEx. He states that on February 5, 2014, Clatterbuck asked him to meet to discuss the decision made with respect to Corbin's suspension. ECF No. 67 at 1; ECF No. 71 ¶ 19. Corbin obliged and Clatterbuck, Corbin, and another FedEx employee, Art Griffin, met in a conference room at the Norfolk ramp facility at approximately 12:00 p.m. ECF No. 67 at 1; ECF No. 71 ¶ 19; see also Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 13 ("On February 5, 2014, I met with Plaintiff."). Corbin claims that "during this meeting[,] [he] was given an ultimatum to be terminated or force[d] to resign[]." ECF No. 71 ¶ 19. Specifically, Corbin asserts that, "[a]s Mark Clatterbuck proceeded to hand me the [t]ermination letter[,] he said that he, Mary Davi[n], and his boss Chris Riley had made the decision to terminate my employment with FedEx after a thorough investigation."8 ECF No. 67 at [*20]  l. Corbin then asked "if there w[ere] any other options," and Clatterbuck "said 'No, however you can resign because you are being terminated and if you fight this you will lose.'" Id. Next, Corbin asked how a resignation would affect his ability to find a job, and Clatterbuck reportedly said, "that this would all go away." Id. Corbin then asked if he could speak to his brother and his wife, and Clatterbuck and Griffin left the room so that Corbin could call them. Id. Corbin called his brother and his wife, but was unable to reach either. Id. When Clatterbuck and Griffin returned to the room, Corbin said "ok" and wrote out his resignation letter on a piece of paper that Clatterbuck provided. Id. The letter, signed by Corbin, Clatterbuck, and a witness on February 5, 2014, states: "I Jeffrey P. Corbin resign from FedEx effective 2-5-14. " ECF No. 50-2 at 13. Corbin handed the letter to Clatterbuck, who told Corbin to call to make arrangements to pick up his tool box. ECF No. 67 at 1. Corbin was instructed not to speak to anyone at FedEx and Clatterbuck told him that he was being escorted off the property. Id. Corbin "got in [his] car and left."9 Id.
"[W]here an employee resigns, [*21]  the resignation may nonetheless amount to a constructive discharge, and thus meet the adverse employment action element, where the resignation is deemed to be coerced or involuntary." Bauer v. Holder, 25 F. Supp. 3d 842, 852 (E.D. Va. 2014), vacated on other grounds, Bauer v. Lynch, 812 F.3d 340 (4th Cir. 2016). In deciding whether an apparent resignation is, in fact, involuntary, the Fourth Circuit directs courts to "look[] to the circumstances of the resignation to determine whether the employee was denied the opportunity to make a free choice." Stone v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 855 F.2d 167, 173-74 (4th Cir. 1988).10 The following factors are to be considered: "(1) whether the employee was given some alternative to resignation; (2) whether the employee understood the nature of the choice he was given; (3) whether the employee was given a reasonable time in which to choose; and (4) whether he was permitted to select the effective date of resignation." Id. at 174 (citing Taylor v. United States, 591 F.2d 688, 691, 219 Ct. Cl. 86 (1979)).
In Bauer v. Holder, the court confronted a discharge scenario comparable to the one presented in this case. 25 F. Supp. 3d at 845-854. The court decided, on a motion for summary judgment, that the coerced resignation of the plaintiff constituted an adverse employment action. Id. The plaintiff, Bauer, was a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). Id. at 847-48. After failing a portion of the physical [*22]  fitness test that FBI agents must pass, Bauer "was required to meet immediately with FBI personnel, who informed plaintiff to choose immediately among the following three 'options': (i) to resign as a Special Agent and preserve the possibility of working in the future as an FBI Intelligence Analyst. . .; (ii) to resign and forgo the possibility of any future position with the FBI; or (iii) to be terminated from employment with the FBI." Id. at 851. Bauer was also told that if he chose to resign, "he was required, then and there, to handwrite a resignation memorandum . . . using a template provided to him by the FBI personnel with whom he was meeting." Id. Bauer "'chose' the first option" and "resigned immediately," handwriting a letter of resignation using the template provided. Id.
In Bauer, the court reviewed the factors enumerated in Stone. With respect to the first factor, whether the employee was given some alternative to resignation, the court decided that "the sole alternative offered to plaintiff"—immediate termination—was "no genuine choice or alternative at all." Id. at 852. With respect to the remaining factors, the court found that, although Bauer appeared to understand the nature of the choice [*23]  before him, "he was not given a reasonable time in which to make his decision, nor was he permitted to select the effective date of resignation or any other terms of his resignation." Id. at 853. Instead, Bauer "was required to make his decision right then and there, and after he opted to resign, effective immediately, [he] was required, on-the-spot, to handwrite his resignation letter using the FBI-provided template." Id. The court concluded that, considering the totality of the circumstances, Bauer "lacked free choice in his resignation," such that the resignation amounted to a constructive discharge and an adverse employment action under Title VII. Id. (citing , 48 F.3d 1343 (4th Cir. 1995)). See also Sharif v. United Airlines, Inc., No. 1:14cv1294, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86009, 2015 WL 4042173, at *5 (E.D. Va. July 1, 2015) (finding facts sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that plaintiff was terminated or forced to retire in lieu of termination).
In reviewing the factors set forth in Stone, this Court similarly finds that a jury could determine that Corbin's departure from FedEx was involuntary, constituting a constructive discharge. To begin, a jury could determine that although Corbin seemed to understand the nature of the "choice" he was given, the single alternative to resignation [*24]  presented—immediate termination—was not meaningful. See Bauer, 25 F. Supp. 3d at 852-53. Corbin was forced to accept "the immediate ending" of his employment with FedEx, and "could only choose how this would occur: immediate termination or immediate resignation." See id. at 852. Further, a jury could find that Corbin, like Bauer, was not given a reasonable time in which to choose. , 855 F.2d at 174; Bauer, 25 F. Supp. 3d at 853. Corbin's employment with FedEx was to end on February 5, 2014, either by resignation or termination. Clatterbuck told Corbin as much, and a termination memo was prepared, with an effective discharge date of February 5, 2014. ECF No. 1-2 at 34; ECF No. 67; Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 13. Under these circumstances, Corbin was forced to make a choice during the span of the meeting with Clatterbuck. Notwithstanding that Corbin was afforded an opportunity to make two phone calls, based upon the facts presented, a jury could find that FedEx failed to allow a reasonable time for him to make a decision such that the resignation could be considered voluntary. Lastly, Corbin was not permitted to select the effective date of resignation, or any other terms of the resignation. Compare Stone, 855 F.2d at 177 (finding resignation to be voluntary where plaintiff "dictated the terms of [*25]  his resignation himself, and . . . drove a hard bargain, demanding that he be given a clean record, a delayed effective date, and a full year's salary"), with Bauer, 25 F. Supp. 3d at 853. Instead, knowing that the alternative—termination—would have become effective immediately, Corbin was required to handwrite his resignation on the spot and vacate the property. Given the foregoing, a reasonable jury could find that Corbin's resignation was involuntary, and, therefore, that he suffered an adverse employment action.

(iii) Due to the existence of genuine disputes of material fact, a reasonable jury could find that Corbin was meeting his employer's legitimate expectations.
To establish the third prong of his prima facie case, Corbin must show that, "the time at the employer took the adverse employment action he was performing at a level that met his employer's legitimate expectations." King, 328 F.3d at 149 (citing Brinkley, 180 F.3d at 607). See also Holland, 487 F.3d at 214.
FedEx contends that Corbin cannot prove he was performing his job at a level that met FedEx's legitimate expectations. ECF No. 50 at 18-19. Prior to his departure, Corbin was under investigation by his manager, Clatterbuck, for certain misconduct. E.g., Clatterbuck Decl. ¶¶ 7-13. Ultimately, Clatterbuck determined [*26]  that Corbin violated FedEx policy when: (1) he sent Asset No. 301876 to an outside vendor for repairs without opening a repair order; (2) he sent Asset No. 301876 to an outside vendor for repair without Clatterbuck's approval; (3) he falsified his time card, indicating that he performed repairs on Asset No. 301876 that he did not perform; and (4) he attempted to coerce an employee of the outside vendor to make false statements regarding the repairs. Id. at ¶ 12. According to FedEx, "the results of Clatterbuck's investigation of Plaintiffs misconduct demonstrate, without question, that Plaintiff failed to perform at a level that met FedEx's legitimate expectations." ECF No. 50 at 19. The Court reviews each of the alleged violations below.
First, Clatterbuck asserts that Corbin violated FedEx policy when he sent Asset No. 301876 to an outside vendor for repairs without opening a repair order.11 Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 12; see also Inter-Office Memorandum Re: Pre-Decision Call, dated Jan. 31, 2014, ECF No. 1-22 at 3 ("Pre-Decision Call Mem.") ("I checked our Shop Floor System and found that there wasn't an open RO for asset 301876."). Corbin disputes this assertion, noting that lines 8 and 11 [*27]  of his January 17, 2014 time card show an open repair order, 7926359, for that asset. ECF No. 71 ¶¶ 11, 15(c), 31. See also ECF No. 57-1 at 3, ¶ 8 ("[The] time card clearly shows that between Line #3411 . . . Asset 301876 consist[s] of two different RO's on Jan 17, 2014 of #7925895 and RO #7926359."); id. at 4, ¶ 14 ("The Asset #301876 had an open RO 7926359" shown on the time card.).
Corbin's time card shows two repair order numbers that correspond with Asset No. 301876: (1) 7925892 ("RO 5892"); and (2) 7826359 ("RO 6359"). ECF No. 59-1 at 9, lines 3-6 (RO 5892), line 8 (RO 6359), line 11 (RO 6359). The repair orders report activity with respect to Asset No. 301876 on January 17, 2014 and days thereafter. ECF No. 57-1 at 10 (RO 5892); ECF No. 68 at 5 (RO 6359). RO 5892 shows that some labor was performed on Asset No. 301876 on January 17, 2014, and that the asset was "down" for 4.05 hours on that day. ECF No. 57-1 at 10. Lines 3 through 6 of the time card, which correspond with RO 5892, report that Corbin performed the following tasks on Asset No. 301876: "conv towing/pick-up/del;" "belt & retainer assembly;" "speaker assembly-radio;" and "lamp-clearance (former." ECF No. 59-1 at 9. Handwritten [*28]  notes of unknown origin on RO 5892, apparently made after its creation, indicate that the tasks documented on the RO are the same as those documented on the time card. ECF No. 57-1 at 10. The other repair order, RO 6359, shows that some labor was performed on Asset No. 301876 on January 17, 2014, and that the truck was "down" for 90 hours between January 17, 2014 and January 24, 2014. ECF No. 68 at 5. Lines 8 and 11 of the time card, which correspond with RO 6359, report that Corbin performed the following tasks: "cab & sheet metal," and "conv towing/pick-up/del." ECF No. 59-1 at 9. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Corbin, a genuine dispute of material fact exists about whether Corbin opened a repair order prior to sending Asset No. 301876 to an outside vendor.
Second, Clatterbuck asserts that Corbin violated FedEx policy when he sent Asset No. 301876 to an outside vendor for repair without Clatterbuck's approval. Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 12. Corbin claims that he obtained Clatterbuck's approval for an outside vendor to repair Asset No. 301876, but that the approval was only for repairs related to the truck's faring and body damage. E.g., ECF No. ¶¶ 5, 15(b), 31. An e-mail [*29]  from Clatterbuck to Corbin shows that Clatterbuck approved outside repairs related to the body of the vehicle on January 16, 2014. ECF No. 57-1 at 8-9. See also Pre-Decision Call Mem. 3 ("I had given approval for the fairings to be removed and damage repaired on 1/16/2014."). Corbin claims that the vendor "broke protocol by doing the wrong work instead of the [approved] faring and bodywork." ECF No. 71 ¶ 10(f).  at ¶ 15(b) ("Vendor made repairs to make his company easy money. He knew what he was doing when he made the repairs without permission from FedEx management.").
FedEx and Corbin set forth competing claims concerning whether Corbin requested the vendor to make any non-approved repairs. According to the vendor foreman, James Lassiter ("Lassiter"), Corbin requested that the vendor, Truck Refrigeration Repair, "replace the broken seat belt, speakers, cab marker lights, and clutch on the vehicle, among other things." Lassiter Decl., ECF No. 504 ¶ 5. See also Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 8("James Lassiter, a foreman at Truck Refrigeration Repair, informed me that Plaintiff requested that the vendor make a number of repairs, including replacement of the clutch, cab marker lights, stereo speakers, [*30]  and seat belt. I had not approved any of these repairs."). Corbin denies making these requests. E.g., ECF No. 57-1 at 39, ¶ 5("Plaintiff Corbin did not request Jimmy [Lassiter] at Truck Refrigeration to make repairs of the speakers, marker lights, and seat belt and clutch."); id. at 3, ¶ 8("Plaintiff Corbin did not ask James, 'Jimmy at Truck Refrigeration' Lassiter to make the repairs . . . . It is Jimmy['s] words against mine."); id. at 24 ("Vendor (Jimmy) was not ask[ed] to repair the seat belt, speakers, and marker lights, however [he] was asked to investigate why the noise was happening.").
FedEx policy requires that a manager approve a repair by an outside vendor if the cost of the repair exceeds $1,000.00. Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 6. See also Pl. Dep. 45:1-15. There is no information before the Court, such as a repair estimate by the outside vendor, to indicate whether the cost of allegedly non-approved repairs made by the vendor on January 17, 2014 was expected to exceed $1,000.00.12 Two invoices from the vendor for repairs on Asset No. 301876, dated January 27, 2014 and January 31, 2014, report the amount owed as $3,197.00 and $1,833.31. ECF No. 57-1 at 49, 50. The invoices appear to account for labor [*31]  related to the clutch, seat belt, lights, speakers, and painting, as well as paint supplies and body repair parts. Id. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Corbin, a genuine dispute of material fact exists about whether FedEx policy required Corbin to obtain management approval beyond that obtained for the vehicle body work, and, therefore, whether Corbin sent Asset No. 301876 to an outside vendor for repair without management approval in violation of FedEx policy.
Third, Clatterbuck asserts that Corbin violated FedEx policy when he falsified his time card, indicating that he performed repairs on Asset No. 301876 that he did not perform. Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 12. On January 24, 2014, Clatterbuck discovered that Corbin sent Asset No. 301876 to the outside vendor for repairs. Id. at ¶ 7. Subsequently, foreman Lassiter informed Clatterbuck that Corbin "requested that [the vendor] replace the broken seat belt, speakers, cab marker lights, and clutch on the vehicle, among other things." Lassiter Decl. ¶ 5. Clatterbuck reviewed Corbin's time card from January 17, 2014 "and confirmed that the repairs [Corbin] claimed that he made on January 17, 2014 were the same repairs . [*32]  . . being completed by Truck Refrigeration Repair." Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 9. On January 28, 2014, Clatterbuck visited Truck Refrigeration Repair to "inspect the parts that were removed from Asset No. 301876 to determine whether the repairs had already been made by [Corbin]." Id. at ¶ 10. Clatterbuck concluded that Truck Refrigeration Repair, rather than Corbin, replaced the seat belt, speakers, cab marker lights, and clutch. See Pre-Decision Call Mem. 3-4.
Corbin disputes the claim of time-card falsification. E.g., ECF No. 71 ¶ 8 ("Time Card is true and correct."); ECF No. 57-1 at 4, ¶ 14 ("Plaintiff Corbin did not falsify his time card."). He asserts that the time card does not reflect whether repairs were completed, but instead reports "diagnosing and other maintenance that is not finished or complete." ECF No. 71 ¶ 12. See also id. at ¶ 13 ("Plaintiff never stated he made repairs. Plaintiff inspected and diagnosed] several problems," ordered parts, and sent those parts to the vendor.); id. at ¶ 15(c) (noting that his time card "[i]ndicates diagnosing [and] part order"); ECF No. 57-1 at 4, ¶ 9 ("Time card shows time . . . diagnosing, troubleshooting and modifying from start time to [*33]  finish time."); id. at 24 ("Manager is misrepresenting the information by stating that the time card shows work accomplished, time cards shows the amount of time it takes to diagnose to see what is need[ed] to repair any problem found during the diagnosing.").
Corbin's January 17, 2014 time card reports that he spent time performing the following tasks on Asset No. 301876: "conv towing/pick-up/del;" "belt & retainer assembly;" "speaker assembly—radio;" "lamp—clearance (former;" and "cab & sheet metal." ECF No. 59-1 at 9. The task code associated with each of these entries is "95," which, according to the FedEx Express Global Vehicles Manual, signifies "[t]ime employee spent performing maintenance on vehicles." ECF No. 59-1 at 13.
Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Corbin, a genuine dispute of material facts exists about whether Corbin falsified his time card. Clatterbuck's investigation revealed that the vendor, rather than Corbin, replaced the seat belt, speakers, lights, and clutch. See Clatterbuck Decl. ¶¶ 9-10; Pre-Decision Call Mem. 3-4. The time card, however, does not explicitly report that Corbin completed those tasks. Instead, the time card contains cryptic or ambiguous [*34]  task descriptions with an associated work code that simply indicates Corbin performed "maintenance" with respect to those tasks.
Fourth, Clatterbuck asserts that Corbin violated FedEx policy when he attempted to coerce an employee of the outside vendor to make false statements regarding the repairs. Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 12. On January 28, 2014, Clatterbuck placed Corbin on investigative suspension and requested that Corbin provide a written statement about the events surrounding the repairs to Asset No. 301876.13 Id. at ¶ 11. While composing his statement, Corbin left to "tak[e] a bathroom break." Id. Lassiter called Clatterbuck "[s]hortly thereafter." Id. Lassiter informed Clatterbuck that Corbin had called him "and demanded that he tell Clatterbuck that Plaintiff made the repairs and not the vendor." Id. Lassiter felt bullied by Corbin. Id.; see also Lassiter Decl. ¶ 7 ("Mr. Corbin was upset and attempted to bully me into lying to Mr. Clatterbuck that he made the repairs."). Lassiter provided a written statement about the call to Clatterbuck. ECF No. 50-4 at 4.14
Corbin disputes the substance of this call. Corbin states that on January 28, 2014, he contacted Lassiter "to ask about the warranty [*35]  on Asset 301876," which was "supposedly" repaired in October 2013 when Corbin was out of work for surgery. ECF No. 57-1 at 39, ¶ 7. On that call, Lassiter told Corbin that Scott sent a different vehicle, Asset No. 301875, to the vendor to have its clutch repaired, and that "there was no warranty" on Asset No. 301876. Id. at ¶ 8. "[N]othing else was discussed" on the call. Id. See also ECF No. 71 ¶ 14 ("[T]he call to the vendor was only to verify if the truck was under warranty."). Corbin also states:
• "Plaintiff Corbin never ask[ed] James 'Jimmy at Truck Refrigeration' Lassiter to cover up [and] say he (Plaintiff) had completed the job in question." ECF No. 57-1 at 24, ¶ 9.
• "Plaintiff Corbin did not bully Jimmy." Id. at ¶ 11.
• "Plaintiff did not make any demand to Jimmy at Truck Refrigeration." Id. at 4, ¶ 11.
• "No . . . coerc[ion] was done by Plaintiff Corbin." Id. at ¶ 12.
• "Mr. Clatterbuck and the vendor both fabricated the bullying was done on my part." ECF No. 71 ¶ 14.
Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Corbin, a genuine dispute of material fact exists about whether Corbin attempted to coerce Lassiter to make false statements regarding the repairs.
In light of the foregoing, [*36]  the Court concludes that Corbin has satisfied his burden with respect to the third prong of his prima facie case.15

(iv) Corbin has not established the fourth prong of his prima facie case.
With respect to the fourth prong of a Title VII plaintiff's prima facie case, the Fourth Circuit has recognized that "[w]hat is critical . . . is that the plaintiff demonstrate he was [terminated] 'under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.'" EEOC v. Sears Roebuck & Co., 243 F.3d 846, 851 n.2 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253). The Fourth Circuit has also held, however, that, as a general rule, a plaintiff must establish the fourth prong of a prima facie case for discriminatory termination by showing that the position was filled by someone outside the plaintiff's protected class. Miles v. Dell, Inc., 429 F.3d 480, 485-87 (4th Cir. 2005). Still, "[t]here are 'exceptions to this rule in limited situations.'" Lettieri v. Equant Inc., 478 F.3d 640, 647 (4th Cir. 2007) (citing Brown v. McLean, 159 F.3d 898, 905 (4th Cir. 1998)). Such exceptions include, but are not limited to, "when the defendant hires someone from within the plaintiff's protected class in order 'to disguise its act of discrimination toward the plaintiff,'" Miles, 429 F.3d at 488 (citing Brown, 159 F.3d at 905-06), and when "the firing and replacement hiring decisions are [*37]  made by different decisionmakers." Id. at 489.
Neither party has provided the Court with any information concerning: (1) whether FedEx replaced Corbin with another individual following his departure; (2) the identity of any such individual; or (3) whether the firing and any replacement hiring decisions were made by different decision makers.
FedEx contends that Corbin may satisfy the fourth prong by "identifying a similarly situated employee who is not African American who engaged in similar misconduct and was not terminated." ECF No. 50 at 21. FedEx seems to draw on Lightner v. City of Wilmington, N.C., 545 F.3d 260 (4th Cir. 2008), which articulates the elements of a prima facie case in the discriminatory discipline context. According to Lightner, an employee who claims to have suffered a discriminatory disciplinary decision may establish a prima facie case under the McDonnell Douglas framework by showing "(1) that plaintiff engaged in prohibited conduct similar to that of a person of another race . . . and (2) that disciplinary measures enforced against the plaintiff were more severe than those enforced against the other person." 545 F.3d at 264-65 (quoting Moore v. City of Charlotte, 754 F.2d 1100, 1105-06 (4th Cir. 1985)).16 To this end, FedEx asserts that Corbin "was not disciplined differently than other FedEx employees," and that there [*38]  has not been an employee at the Norfolk ramp facility who was not terminated after a finding that such employee "1) falsified a time card; 2) violated policy regarding repairs by outside vendors; and 3) attempted to bully an outside vendor into lying to conceal the employee's falsification." Davin Decl. ¶ 11.
Corbin has not demonstrated that disciplinary measures enforced against him were more severe than those enforced against another employee, outside his protected class, who allegedly engaged in similar misconduct. In his second amended complaint, Corbin does allege that he was "treated differently from other people in the company . . . especially my white / not disabled co-worker," and that "[t]he work order practice is a very common practice and no other people were ever disciplined for it . . . yet, I am being fired for it because of my race and disability." ECF No. 6 at 4. Corbin, however, has not provided evidence to support these allegations.17 Moreover, Corbin opposes FedEx's motion for summary judgment by, among other things, denying any wrongdoing on his part with respect to the circumstances surrounding his termination; therefore, [*39]  Corbin seems to have abandoned his claim that he was punished for conduct routinely committed by other FedEx employees. In his opposition, Corbin states that he supports his claim of racial discrimination "based on comments, emails and this sabotaged case. The only thing that separates Corbin and Scott is Plaintiff Corbin is black and Tom Scott is white." ECF No. 71 ¶ 23. Corbin has not, however, provided evidence to show that Scott was treated differently after engaging in misconduct similar to that which FedEx determined Corbin had committed. Accordingly, the Court finds that Corbin has not satisfied his burden with respect to the fourth prong of his prima facie case. As a result, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of FedEx on Corbin's claim of race-based discrimination.

2. Corbin has not established that FedEx's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions was pretextual.
Even if Corbin was able to establish a prima facie case of race-based discrimination, summary judgment in favor of FedEx would still be warranted. If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for [*40]  the employment action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. Next, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that the stated reason for the employment action is a pretext for discrimination. Guessous, 828 F.3d at 216 (citing Burdine, 450 U.S. at 252-56); Shun-Lung Chao, 424 F. App'x at 260 (citing McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-04).
FedEx met its burden by providing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Corbin's termination—namely, that the termination decision was based on Corbin's falsification of his time-card, his failure to follow policies for repairs by outside vendors, and his attempt to coerce the vendor into lying about the repairs in question. Consequently, the burden shifts back to Corbin to prove that the stated reason for the adverse employment action is pretextual. Guessous, 828 F.3d at 216 (citing Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 at 252-56, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207).
Although Corbin has demonstrated that a genuine dispute of material fact exists concerning whether he met FedEx's legitimate expectations at the time of his termination, Corbin has failed to set forth facts sufficient for a jury to conclude that the proffered reasons for his termination were a pretext for race-based discrimination. Corbin contends that FedEx misrepresented or misinterpreted his time card and the repair orders, and that he did not violate company policies as alleged. Corbin has not demonstrated, however, that the stated reasons [*41]  for termination were not the real reasons for his discharge. See Hawkins v. PepsiCo, Inc., 203 F.3d 274, 279 (4th Cir. 2000).
After learning of potential violations of FedEx policy, Clatterbuck conducted an investigation which involved examination of Corbin's time card, inspection of the vehicle and parts at issue, and a conversation with the vendor foreman. Clatterbuck Decl. ¶¶ 7-11. Based on this investigation, Clatterbuck determined that Corbin violated FedEx policies. Id. at ¶ 12. Accordingly, and in consultation with human resources, the decision was made to terminate Corbin's employment. Id. at ¶ 13; Davin Decl. ¶ 10.
Corbin's disagreement with the conclusions of Clatterbuck's investigation, and the conflicting record concerning Corbin's job performance, do not suffice to establish pretext: when an employer articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for discharging the plaintiff, "it is not [the] province [of the court] to decide whether the reason was wise, fair, or even correct, ultimately, so long as it truly was the reason for the plaintiff's termination." DeJarnette v. Corning Inc., 133 F.3d 293,299 (4th Cir. 1998) (quoting Giannopoulos v. Brack & Brock Confections, Inc., 109 F.3d 406, 410 (7th Cir. 1997)). See also Hawkins, 203 F.3d at 280 ("[I]n a wrongful discharge action it is the perception of the decision maker which is relevant, not the self assessment of the plaintiff.") (citations [*42]  and internal quotations omitted). Corbin has not offered facts sufficient for a jury to conclude that FedEx's proffered reasons were not truly the basis for his termination. Stated differently, Corbin has not demonstrated that Clatterbuck did not honestly believe that Corbin violated FedEx policies in the manner described above. See Gibson v. Fluor Daniel Servs. Corp., 281 F. App'x 177, 179 (4th Cir. 2008) ("An employer who fires an employee under the mistaken but honest impression that the employee violated a work rule is not liable for discriminatory conduct.") (quoting Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets, 196 F.3d 1354, 1363 n.3 (11th Cir. 1999)); Holland, 487 F.3d at 220 (affirming award of summary judgment to defendant, finding that whether plaintiff actually made physical threats towards his supervisor was "irrelevant. . . because it is uncontested that the decisionmaker believed that he [made such threats]").
Moreover, Corbin "does nothing more than speculate" that racial animus motivated the decision to terminate him. Hawkins, 203 F.3d at 280. In essence, Corbin asserts that Scott, his white co-worker, consistently harassed him and reviewed his work, and that neither Clatterbuck, his white manager, nor the human resources department, handled the situation appropriately. See ECF No. 71 ¶¶ 15(c), 19, 22-24; Pl. Dep. 7:2-11:1,17:2-13,20:4-23:25. Taking the facts in the light [*43]  most favorable to Corbin, the evident tension, not uncommon in workplace settings, is devoid of a racial character and insufficient to establish pretext. See Hawkins, 203 F.3d at 281 ("[A] showing of a difference of opinion, coupled with [plaintiff's] conclusory allegations of racism, cannot reasonably support the conclusion that [plaintiff's] discharge was motivated by racial animus."). Although not offered in support of Corbin's opposition to the motion for summary judgment, the narrative in Corbin's second amended complaint illustrates this point. Corbin claims, among other things:
Tom Scott started gunning for me not long after I got there. It was obvious that he didn't want me there and it was obvious that he was going to do everything he could to get me out of there, but I could not understand why, except that he viewed himself as being superior to me, so I felt it might be due to my race and disability.
ECF No. 6 at 3-4 (emphasis added). Speculative and conclusory statements do not create a triable jury issue.
Given that FedEx has met its burden of proffering a nondiscriminatory reason for Corbin's discharge, and considering the absence of evidence or genuine disputes of material fact concerning pretext, [*44]  the Court finds an additional basis for granting FedEx's motion for summary judgment with respect to Corbin's Title VII claim.

C. Corbin's ADA claim
Corbin also claims that FedEx discriminated against him on the basis of his disability, in violation of the ADA. ECF No. 6 at 3-5. Specifically, Corbin contends that he was wrongfully terminated and that FedEx denied him reasonable accommodations. Id. at 4. The ADA prohibits a covered employer from "discriminating] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).
The facts concerning Corbin's claimed disability and requests for accommodations can be summarized as follows. In 1990 or 1991, Corbin was assigned a military disability rating of 20 percent. ECF No. 71 ¶ 25; see also ECF No. 1-2 at 38. Corbin testified during his deposition that his disability was "two knee replacements" and that he "need[s] assistance to lift things." Pl. Dep. 30:6-14. In his complaint, Corbin describes his disability as "chronic knees and impairment which prevents me from doing work that others may be able to do and may not need assistance with and limits my ability to walk, climb and engage in other activities." ECF No. 6 at 4.
According to Corbin, Clatterbuck [*45]  "knew about [his] disability" because Corbin "had to update [his] status yearly in the FedExPrism validate system." ECF No. 71 ¶ 25. See also Pl. Dep 31:25-32:3 ("[Clatterbuck] knew I was a VA vet, and he knew I had knee problems. I've called in a few times because they were either aching or either too sore . . . to come to work."). Corbin underwent surgery on his right knee in July 2012 and on his left knee in October 2013. ECF No. 71 ¶ 29. After his second surgery, he was out of work for approximately two and a half months, and returned in January 2014. Pl. Dep. 32:15-33:4. Corbin provided a note from his surgeon, Dr. Daniel R. Cavazos, to Clatterbuck, indicating that Corbin was returning to work in January with "no restrictions."18 ECF No. 59-1 at 8. See also Pl. Dep. 33:20-34:18.
Corbin claims that FedEx failed to accommodate his disability by not providing him two tools that he requested to assist him with his work—a clutch jack dolly and a drum brake dolly. ECF No. 6 at 4; Pl. Dep. 35:3-19. According to Corbin, he requested the clutch jack dolly in August, September, and early October of 2013. ECF No. 71 ¶ 28. See also id. at ¶ 31 ("Plaintiff informed Mark Clatterbuck in August [*46]  and Sept[ember] that in order to make the repairs on Asset 301876['s] clutch that he would need to have a clutch jack available."); ECF No. 57-1 at 4, ¶ 14 ("Corbin spent August and September requesting for that tool only to never receive it."); Pl. Dep. 36:7-10 (testifying that he made one request for the clutch jack dolly in October 2013). Corbin requested the drum brake dolly "way before" the request for the clutch jack dolly. Pl. Dep. 36:18-19. Both those requests were "denied." Pl. Dep. 35:5-11.
According to Clatterbuck, Corbin requested that the clutch jack dolly be ordered in October 2013, and he "intended to order the clutch jack dolly when [Corbin] returned to work from medical leave." Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 14. "[B]efore the tool could be ordered," however, Clatterbuck discovered Corbin's alleged violations of FedEx policies. Id. With respect to the drum brake dolly, Corbin testified that he "found a jack [and] that [he] could work it to where [he] could put it on the brake drums." Pl. Dep. 38:20-22. FedEx construes this statement as indicating that Corbin "did not need the brake dolly he requested, as he utilized a tool already available to him to perform the tasks that the [*47]  brake dolly would." ECF No. 50 at 23. Corbin responds by noting that the tool FedEx refers to "is unsafe and against OSHA regulation." ECF No. 71 ¶ 27.

1. Wrongful discharge
Two methods of proof are available to plaintiffs asserting an ADA wrongful discharge claim. "[W]hen an employer admits that the alleged disability played a role in the discharge, the plaintiff must . . . establish: (1) that he has a disability; (2) that he was qualified for the job; and (3) that his termination constituted discrimination based on the disability." Taylor v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 376 F. Supp. 2d 653, 659 (E.D. Va. 2005), aff'd sub nom. Taylor v. Wal-Mart Stores, 158 F. App'x 446 (4th Cir. 2005) (citing Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., Inc., 31 F.3d 209, 212 (4th Cir. 1994)). Alternatively, where the employer offers a reason for the discharge that is unrelated to the disability, a Court considers the claim in light of the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Shiflett v. GE Fanuc Automation Corp., 151 F.3d 1030, 1998 WL 386116, *5 (4th Cir. 1998); Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'n of Bus. & Educ. Radio, 53 F.3d 55, 57-58 (4th Cir. 1995). Here, FedEx's stated reason for Corbin's discharge was unrelated to his disability. Accordingly, the Court applies the burden-shifting framework.

(a) Corbin has not established a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination.
The elements of a prima facie case for discriminatory discharge under the ADA closely parallel those for such a claim under Title VII, discussed above. The ADA plaintiff must demonstrate that: "(1) he is within [*48]  the ADA'S protected class; (2) he was discharged; (3) at the time of his discharge, he was performing the job at a level that met his employer's legitimate expectations; and (4) his discharge occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination." Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., 252 F.3d 696, 702 (4th Cir. 2001) (citing Ennis, 53 F.3d at 58). For purposes of the motion for summary judgment, FedEx does not contest that Corbin was within the ADA's protected class. ECF No. 50 at 17.
The Court incorporates its analysis, set forth above, with respect to the second and third prongs of the plaintiff's prima facie case.
Although a reasonable jury could find that Corbin was discharged, and although Corbin has raised genuine disputes of material fact concerning his job performance, the Court is unable to conclude that Corbin has carried his burden with respect to the fourth prong of the prima facie case, which requires that Corbin show his discharge occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. See Ennis, 53 F.3d at 58 (describing the need for this particular formulation of the fourth prong in a typical ADA discharge case). To make such a showing, Corbin "must present affirmative evidence that disability was a determining [*49]  factor in [FedEx's] decision." Shiflett, 151 F.3d 1030, 1998 WL 386116, *6 (citing Ennis, 53 F.3d at 59). "Mere unsupported speculation . . . is not enough to defeat a summary judgment motion." Ennis, 53 F.3d at 62 (citing Felty v. Graves-Humphreys Co., 818 F.2d 1126, 1128 (4th Cir. 1987)).
A jury could not find that the circumstances of Corbin's discharge create a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. Nothing in the record links Corbin's termination to his disability status. See Ennis, 53 F.3d at 62. There is no affirmative evidence that Corbin's disability played a role in FedEx's decision to terminate him. See Shiflett, 151 F.3d 1030, 1998 WL 386116, at *6. Although the evidence does suggest a "strained relationship" existed among Corbin and Scott and Clatterbuck, "this is too slender a reed upon which to base a finding of intentional discrimination." Wilson v. Maryland-Nat'l Capital Park & Planning Comm'n, 178 F.3d 1289, 1999 WL 279878, at *4 (4th Cir. 1999). Consequently, Corbin's prima facie case does not stand.
As noted above, even if Corbin had established a prima facie case under the ADA, FedEx met its burden of providing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Corbin's termination—FedEx's determination that Corbin violated several company policies. Consequently, the burden shifts back to Corbin to offer sufficient facts such that a reasonable jury could find the stated reason for his termination was pretextual, and he has not done so. Again, Corbin has not offered facts to show [*50]  that FedEx's proffered reasons were not truly the basis for his termination or that Clatterbuck did not honestly believe that Corbin violated FedEx policies in the manner described. See Gibson, 281 F. App'x at 179; Holland, 487 F.3d at 220; Hawkins, 203 F.3d at 279-80; DeJarnette, 133 F.3d at 299. Corbin merely speculates that his disability was a determining factor in FedEx's decision, and "has not met his burden of rebutting the employer's stated, legitimate reason for termination." Shiflett, 151 F.3d 1030, 1998 WL 386116, at *6 (citing St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)).
The Court GRANTS FedEx's motion for summary judgment with respect to Corbin's ADA claim for wrongful discharge.

2. Reasonable accommodation
Corbin also alleges that FedEx discriminated against him by failing to accommodate his disability. ECF No. 6 at 4. The ADA prohibits an employer from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Such unlawful discrimination includes an employer's failure to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).19 Reasonable accommodations may include, among other things, "making existing facilities used [*51]  by employees . . . usable by individuals with disabilities; and . . . acquisition or modification of equipment or devices." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9).
To establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: "(1) that he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of his disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the position . . . ; and (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations." Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal quotations and citations omitted) (alterations in original). With respect to the first element of the prima facie case, FedEx does not dispute, for purposes of its motion for summary judgment, that Corbin "is disabled within the meaning of the statute." ECF No. 50 at 22.
With respect to the second element, the employee bears the burden of providing notice to his employer, but the burden "is not an onerous one: the employee does not need to mention the ADA or use the phrase 'reasonable accommodation,' but need only inform the employer of both the disability and the employee's need for accommodations for that disability." Schneider v. Giant of Maryland, LLC, 389 F. App'x 263, 270 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing EEOC v. Fed. Express Corp., 513 F.3d 360, 369 n.5 (4th Cir. 2008)). FedEx does not dispute, [*52]  for purposes of this motion, that it had notice of Corbin's disability.20 ECF No. 50 at 22.
FedEx argues, however, that Corbin's request for tools "falls short of being a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." Id. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Corbin, a jury could find that he requested an accommodation. It is undisputed that Corbin's knee problems necessitated replacement surgery upon both his knees. See, e.g., ECF No. 71 ¶ 29; ECF No. 50 at 13, 22; Pl. Dep. 30:6-7. It is also undisputed that the second of these surgeries took place in October 2013, and, as a result, Corbin missed approximately two and a half months of work. See, e.g., ECF No. 50 at 13; Pl. Dep. 32:15-33:4. Further, it is undisputed that, before undergoing his second surgery, Corbin asked Clatterbuck to obtain a clutch jack dolly to aid him in performing his job. See, e.g., Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 14; ECF No. 71 ¶ 31. Corbin states that he "asked for the clutch jack tool to make it easier on his bad knee before the surgery and having that tool after the surgery would help prevent [him] from reinjuring his knees." ECF No. 71 ¶ 30. Although Clatterbuck did not undertake this task immediately, [*53]  Clatterbuck's declaration notes that he "intended to order the clutch jack dolly when [Corbin] returned to work from medical leave." Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 14. From this statement of intent, a jury could reasonably infer that Clatterbuck knew that Corbin wanted an accommodation due to issues with his knees and further understood the alleged need for accommodation continued after Corbin's October 2013 surgery. Accordingly, and inasmuch as the ADA does not require a formal system of notification, see Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 313 (3d Cir. 1999), a jury could find that FedEx not only knew of Corbin's disability (as conceded for purposes of FedEx's motion for summary judgment), but also reasonably understood that he desired an accommodation. See Ballard v. Rubin, 284 F.3d 957, 962 (8th Cir. 2002) ("What matters . . . are not formalisms about the manner of the request, but whether the employee . . . provides the employer with enough information that, under the circumstances, the employer can be fairly said to know of both the disability and the desire for an accommodation.").
Corbin has satisfied his burden, at this stage, with respect to the third and fourth elements his prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the ADA. With respect to the third element—whether Corbin could [*54]  perform the essential functions of the position with reasonable accommodation—Corbin testified that the clutch jack dolly "would assist [him] to put a clutch in a vehicle," and that a drum brake dolly "would help [him] with the heavy parts that you need to put on a [brake or clutch.]" Pl. Dep. 35:5-11. See also ECF No. 71 ¶ 30 (stating that he asked for the clutch jack dolly to make replacing the clutch easier on his knee before surgery and to prevent reinjury after surgery, and noting that "replacing the clutch is an often repair task at the [Norfolk] location."). In light of FedEx's failure to address this element, a reasonable jury could find that Corbin could perform the essential functions of his position with reasonable accommodation.
With respect to the fourth element, FedEx denies that it refused to provide Corbin the tools he requested. ECF No. 50 at 23. FedEx argues that, "by his own admission, Plaintiff did not need the brake dolly he requested, as he utilized a tool already available to him to perform the tasks that the brake dolly would." ECF No. 50 at 23 (citing Pl. Dep. 38:18-23). FedEx further contends that Corbin requested the clutch jack dolly in October 2013, the [*55]  same month he was scheduled to take medical leave for knee surgery. ECF No. 50 at 23 (citing Pl. Dep. 36:5 13). Clatterbuck "intended to order the clutch jack dolly when [Corbin] returned to work from medical leave, but, "before the tool could be ordered," Clatterbuck discovered Corbin's alleged violations of FedEx policies. Clatterbuck Decl. ¶ 14. "[Corbin] resigned before the tool could be ordered." ECF No. 50 at 23.
Corbin, on the other hand, testified that he made a request for the clutch jack dolly in October 2013, Pl. Dep. 36:1-10, but states that he requested the tool earlier, as well. See ECF No. 71 ¶ 28 ("Plaintiff requested [the clutch jack dolly] in Aug, Sept and in early Oct 2013"); id. at ¶ 31 ("Plaintiff informed Mark Clatterbuck in August and Sept[ember] that in order to make the repairs on Asset 301876['s] clutch that he would need to have a clutch jack available."); ECF No. 57-1 at 4, ¶ 14 ("Corbin spent August and September requesting for that tool only to never receive it."). Given the competing claims about when Corbin requested the tools, and considering that Corbin did not receive either tool before his employment ended, a jury could find that FedEx declined to [*56]  accommodate Corbin. In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that Corbin has set forth facts sufficient for a jury to find he has established a prima facie case of ADA reasonable accommodation discrimination.
If a plaintiff establishes such a prima facie case, the employer can still avoid liability "if it can show as a matter of law that the proposed accommodation will cause undue hardship in the particular circumstances." Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cty., Md., 789 F.3d 407, 414 (4th Cir. 2015) (quotations omitted) (quoting Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 464 (4th Cir. 2012)); 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). FedEx has not addressed the question of undue hardship. Consequently, Corbin's claim that FedEx failed to reasonably accommodate his disability—from approximately August 2013 to October 2013 and January 2014 to February 5, 2014—may proceed. FedEx's motion for summary judgment with respect to this claim is DENIED.21

D. Corbin's hostile work environment claim
Corbin states in his second amended complaint that Scott bullied and harassed him, and that Clatterbuck and human resources did nothing about it. ECF No. 6 at 4-7. To the extent Corbin attempts to allege claims for hostile work environment on the basis of race or disability, the Court dismisses those claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

1. Exhaustion [*57]  of administrative remedies
Corbin failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to any hostile work environment claims alleged in the second amended complaint. As a result, this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over such claims. See Jones v. Calvert Grp., Ltd., 551 F.3d 297, 300 (4th Cir. 2009).
With respect to both Title VII and ADA claims, "a plaintiff must exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a charge with the EEOC before pursuing a suit in federal court." Sydnor v. Fairfax County, Va., 681 F.3d 591, 593 (4th Cir. 2012). "The allegations contained in the administrative charge of discrimination generally operate to limit the scope of any subsequent judicial complaint." Evans v. Techs. Applications & Serv. Co., 80 F.3d 954, 962-63 (4th Cir. 1996). "[C]ourts bar claims that allege discrimination on a different basis, of a different type, or of a different scope than the plaintiff alleged in the administrative charge." Lucas v. Henrico Cty. Sch. Bd., 822 F. Supp. 2d 589, 602 (E.D. Va. 2011) (citing Chacko v. Patuxent Inst., 429 F.3d 505, 509 (4th Cir. 2005)). Moreover, "the factual allegations made in formal litigation must correspond to those set forth in the administrative charge." Chacko, 429 F.3d at 509. In sum, a plaintiff's judicial complaint may encompass "[o]nly those discrimination claims stated in the initial charge, those reasonably related to the original complaint, and those developed by reasonable investigation of the original complaint." Evans, 80 F.3d at 963. "At the same time, however, lawyers do not typically [*58]  complete the administrative charges, and so courts construe them liberally." Chacko, 429 F.3d at 509 (citing Alvarado v. Bd. of Trs. of Montgomery Cmty. Coll., 848 F.2d 457, 460 (4th Cir. 1988)).
Corbin may not maintain a hostile work environment claim in this Court. First, Corbin's EEOC charge does not state any hostile work environment or harassment claims or facts. In the charge, Corbin alleges that FedEx discriminated against him on the basis of his race and disability and claims, specifically, that he was suspended and constructively discharged, treated more harshly than a white counterpart, and "denied training and tools necessary to perform [his] position." ECF No. 1-2 at 21.22 The second amended complaint diverges from the EEOC charge, claiming, among other things, that Corbin was the target of Scott's constant "workplace bullying," "verbal abuse," "threats," "lies," and "harassment." ECF No. 6 at 5-7.
Second, although the Court construes Corbin's EEOC charge liberally, the allegations contained in the charge are not reasonably related to any hostile work environment claims set forth in the second amended complaint. See Sydnor, 681 F.3d at 595 ("The touchstone for exhaustion is whether plaintiff's administrative and judicial claims are 'reasonably related'. . . ."). The charge and the complaint address [*59]  different actors and conduct. See Chacko, 429 F.3d at 506 (holding that "a plaintiff fails to exhaust his administrative remedies where, as here, his administrative charges reference different time frames, actors, and discriminatory conduct than the central factual allegations in his formal suit"). The EEOC charge complains of Clatterbuck's behavior as a manager, and references an unnamed "white counterpart" who apparently received different treatment than Corbin. Unlike the second amended complaint, the charge does not identify Scott, or any other co-worker, as a wrongdoer. Moreover, in contrast to the complaint, the charge does not allege any sort of bullying, harassment, or verbal abuse by anyone at FedEx. In these ways, the allegations in the charge and the second amended complaint are not reasonably related.
Third, a reasonable investigation into the factual allegations in the charge "could not be expected to lead" to findings of the conduct Corbin now grieves. Chacko, 429 F.3d at 512. The factual allegations in the charge relate to training, tools, treatment of another employee, and Corbin's suspension and discharge. ECF No. 1-2 at 21. A reasonable investigation into these allegations, which make no mention of harassment, [*60]  would not likely yield discovery of a hostile work environment perpetuated by an individual (Scott) not identified in the charge. See also Chacko, 429 at 509 ("If 'the claims raised under Title VII exceed the scope of the EEOC charge and any charges that would naturally have arisen from an investigation thereof, they are procedurally barred.'") (quoting Dennis v. Cty. of Fairfax, 55 F.3d 151, 156 (4th Cir. 1995)).
Accordingly, the Court finds that Corbin has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to claims for hostile work environment and such claims are dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Johnson v. Merchants Terminal Corp., No. CV ELH-16-838, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64603, 2017 WL 1546429, at *10 (D. Md. Apr. 27, 2017) (finding summary judgment "appropriate as to the claim of harassment, because [plaintiff] did not raise that claim with the EEOC"); Finlay v. Fortis Inst.-Towson, No. CV JKB-15-1184, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137335, 2015 WL 5920905, at *3-5 (D. Md. Oct. 8, 2015) (dismissing plaintiff's Title VII claim of hostile work environment where EEOC charge alleged discriminatory discharge on the basis of race); cf. Baiden-Adams v. Forsythe Transp., Inc., 969 F. Supp. 2d 422, 430 (E.D. Va. 2013) ("Plaintiff's claim of wrongful termination based on sex, without more, does not exhaust administrative remedies as to a sexual harassment claim with a different factual underpinning.").

2. "Severe or pervasive" element
Even if Corbin [*61]  had exhausted his administrative remedies, FedEx has demonstrated that it would be entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on Corbin's hostile work environment claims.

(a) The harassment allegations
Corbin identifies various instances of tension between himself and Scott. At the same time, however, Corbin acknowledges that he and Scott worked different shifts, and that the "confrontations" with Scott usually occurred through e-mail or communications with Clatterbuck. Pl. Dep. 16:25-17:8. Apart from Corbin's first two weeks at the Norfolk ramp facility, when he and Scott worked at the same time, the two worked together "[m]aybe once or twice." Pl. Dep. 17:11-17.
Corbin testified that, when he started working at the Norfolk ramp facility, he was "being harassed" by Scott. Pl. Dep. 7:3-8. Specifically, when the two were working together in March or April 2013, Corbin asked Scott to show him the ground support equipment side of the shop. ECF No. 71 ¶ 22(a). Scott replied, "it would take someone like you thirty years to learn this stuff." Id. Corbin testified, "when I first got to the location . . . [Scott] made a comment about walking through, that it will take a person like me 30 [*62]  years to learn what's going on . . . in the [ground support equipment] side." Pl. Dep. 7:11-15. Scott also "drilled" Corbin by asking Corbin questions on how to make repairs, and replied to Corbin's answers with the phrase, "that's BS." ECF No. 71 ¶ 22(b). Corbin testified that Scott "was looking at my work. He was checking my work or either saying — making comments like, That's BS. You don't do it that way." Pl. Dep. 8:15-17. Scott subjected Corbin to "constant bickering." Pl. Dep. 20:9-10.
In addition, Corbin testified about other exchanges with Scott, none of which appears to have involved race or disability-related comments. Pl. Dep. 9:2-10:15; 20:10-22:4, 22:19-23:25 (describing: disagreements over an internet password, truck part disposal, and a personal package; an instance where other drivers praised Scott for certain work; and Corbin's communications with Scott about how to repair vehicles in extreme weather). Corbin further provided the Court with e-mails between himself, Scott, and Clatterbuck, that were sent between April and October 2013. ECF No. 1-3 at 4, 5, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23, 26; ECF No. 6-60; ECF No. 6-61; ECF No. 6-62; ECF No. 6-64; FDX/CORBIN 1338, 1348-49. The e-mails [*63]  involve communications about vehicle maintenance, scrap metal recycling, a personal package reportedly left for Corbin at a FedEx facility, and work shift changes. None makes reference to Corbin's race or disability.23
Corbin further states that he "made numerous calls to management and Human Resources to complain of the harassment, intimidation, hostile work environment, . . . and belittling comments from Tom Scott." ECF No. 71 ¶ 19. Between August 23, 2013 and February 5, 2014, Corbin spoke with several FedEx human-resources representatives via telephone "to complain about the issues [he] was experiencing working with Tom Scott." ECF No. 57-1 at 23, ¶ 4. On September 20, 2013, Corbin emailed Clatterbuck, writing:
I feel that I am being harassed by [Scott] and my work is being checked daily and unwanted here. I cannot stress to you how I cannot work in these condition[s] can you handle this or do I need to go to HR?
E.g., ECF No. 1-3 at 23; ECF No. 71 ¶ 22(q).

(b) Legal framework
Both Title VII and the ADA create a cause of action for hostile work environment harassment. Fox v. Gen. Motors Corp., 247 F.3d 169, 176 (4th Cir. 2001). Title VII and ADA hostile work environment claims follow parallel methods of proof. Id. at 177. To establish a Title VII hostile [*64]  work environment claim, "a plaintiff must show that there is (1) unwelcome conduct; (2) that is based on the plaintiffs [protected characteristic]; (3) which is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the plaintiff's conditions of employment and to create an abusive work environment; and (4) which is imputable to the employer." Guessous, 828 F.3d at 221 (quotations and citations omitted). To establish an ADA claim for hostile work environment, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on his disability; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) some factual basis exists to impute liability for the harassment to the employer." Fox, 247 F.3d at 177.
Assuming, in the alternative, that Corbin satisfied the exhaustion requirement, FedEx is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law with respect to any hostile work environment claims, as Corbin has not offered supporting facts sufficient to a create a genuine dispute of material fact that he was subject to sufficiently severe or pervasive conduct. "The 'severe or pervasive' element has both [*65]  subjective and objective components." Ocheltree v. Scollon Prods., Inc., 335 F.3d 325, 333 (4th Cir. 2003) (citing Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21-22, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). The plaintiff must demonstrate that he "subjectively perceive[d] the environment to be abusive," Harris, 510 U.S. at 21-22, and "that the conduct was such that 'a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position' would have found the environment objectively hostile or abusive." EEOC v. Sunbelt Rentals, Inc., 521 F.3d 306, 315 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81-82, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998)). FedEx has not challenged that Corbin perceived the work environment to be abusive. The Court, therefore, focuses on the objective component.
When analyzing the objective component of the "severe or pervasive" element, courts must "look[] at all the circumstances." Harris, 510 U.S. at 23. See also Guessous, 828 F.3d at 226 ("[O]n the question of whether the conduct was severe or pervasive, the district court [must] take into account the totality of the circumstances . . . ."). "Relevant considerations 'may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating. . . ; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'" Spriggs v. Diamond Auto Glass, 242 F.3d 179, 184 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 23). The Fourth Circuit has "recognized that plaintiffs must clear a high bar in order to satisfy the severe or pervasive test." Sunbelt Rentals, Inc., 521 F.3d at 315.

(e) Analysis of the harassment allegations
Having considered the totality of the circumstances, [*66]  the Court concludes that the conduct about which Corbin complains, although recurrent, was not particularly severe. The overwhelming majority of confrontations between Scott and Corbin took place through e-mails, in which Scott expressed frustration with Corbin's work, or was otherwise short with him. Corbin does not allege that Scott threatened him physically. Although Corbin claimed that he "[could] not work in these conditions," Scott and Corbin worked different shifts, with a few exceptions, such that Scott's conduct did not "unreasonably interfere[]" with Corbin's daily performance of his duties. Spriggs, 242 F.3d at 184. Accordingly, the Court finds that the allegations of harassment do not satisfy the severe or pervasive test. See, e.g., Tomasello v. Fairfax Cty., No. 1:15cv95, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5578, 2016 WL 165708, at *24 (E.D. Va. Jan. 13, 2016) (finding that "complaints of rudeness, callousness, insensitivity, unfairness, anger, or spite," which "center[ed] in large part on the routine and ordinary aspects of office life such as cold treatment by coworkers . . . or frustrating equipment policies" were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment). As a result, even if Corbin had exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to [*67]  any hostile work environment claims, such claims would fail as a matter of law.

VI. CONCLUSION
FedEx's motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 49, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The Clerk is DIRECTED to send copies of this Order to pro se plaintiff Jeffrey P. Corbin and counsel of record for FedEx.
Corbin and counsel for FedEx are DIRECTED to determine some mutually available times and contact the courtroom deputies at 757-222-7222 to schedule a telephone status conference.
