CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): Order GRANTING Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
Before the Court is a motion for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff Antonio Fernandez ("Plaintiff"). See generally Dkt. # 37 ("Mot."). Defendants Golden Opportunity No 14 LP ("Golden Opportunity"); SPSSM Investments - V, Inc. ("SPSSM"); and JDHS (collectively, "Defendants") did not oppose. The Court finds this matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. Having considered the moving papers, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
I. Background
Plaintiff is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair for mobility. Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts, Dkt. # 37-2 ("SUF"), ¶ 1. In January 2021, Plaintiff visited Liquor Land (the "Store") in Whittier, California to shop and "assess it for compliance with access laws." Id. ¶¶ 2, 5. Golden Opportunity and SPSSM own the property where the Store is located, and JDHS owns and operates the Store itself. Id. ¶¶ 3-4. While shopping, Plaintiff [*2]  was unable to traverse several aisles because they "were very narrow due to the placement of merchandise and displays." Id. ¶ 6. A week later, Plaintiff and an investigator returned to the Store. Id. ¶ 7. The investigator measured various paths of travel throughout the Store and found that they ranged between only 25 and 31 inches wide. Id. ¶ 8.
Plaintiff sued Defendants in February 2021, advancing two causes of action:
First Cause of Action: Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. Complaint, Dkt. # 1 ("Compl."), ¶¶ 24-30.
Second Cause of Action: Violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51-53. Compl. ¶¶ 31-34.
The Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's second cause of action and dismissed it without prejudice. See generally Dkt. # 24.
By August 2021, Plaintiff's Certified Access Specialist program ("CASp") expert, Soyoung Ward ("Ward"), returned to inspect the Store. SUF ¶ 9. Ward measured all aisles throughout the Store "and found that the clear width of the aisle in front of the beverage refrigerator was only 27 1/2 inches wide." Id. ¶ 10. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for summary judgment, seeking an injunction under the ADA requiring Defendants to provide [*3]  and maintain accessible paths of travel throughout their Store. See generally Mot.
II. Legal Standard
"A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. Rather, it draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987). The evidence presented by the parties must be capable of being presented at trial in a form that [*4]  would be admissible in evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See Thornhill Publ'g Co. v. Gen. Tel. & Elecs. Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).
III. Discussion
The Court addresses in turn (A) Defendants' failure to oppose Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and (B) whether Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on the merits of his ADA claim.
A. Failure to Oppose a Motion for Summary Judgment
Under the Local Rules, Defendants needed to file their opposition to Plaintiff's motion no later than December 31, 2021. See L.R. 7-9. As of this date, Defendants still have not filed an opposition. Unlike other motions, courts may not construe failure to oppose a motion for summary judgment as consent to granting the motion. Heinemann v. Satterberg, 731 F.3d 914, 916-17 (9th Cir. 2003); L.R. 7-12. Instead, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) provides several options in the event that a party fails to "properly address another party's assertion of fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). These options include "consider[ing] the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion" and "grant[ing] summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials—including the facts considered undisputed—show that the movant is entitled to it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2)-(3). Accordingly, the Court considers undisputed each of Plaintiff's assertions [*5]  of fact for purposes of this motion.
B. Violation of the ADA
Plaintiff maintains that he is entitled to summary judgment because he has established each element of his ADA claim and there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Mot. 2:18-8:17. The Court agrees.
The ADA provides that "[n]o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Accordingly, to prevail on an ADA claim, a plaintiff must show that (i) "he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA," (ii) "the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation," and (iii) "the plaintiff was denied public accommodations by the defendant because of his disability." Arizona ex rel. Goddard v. Harkins Amusement Enters., 603 F.3d 666, 670 (9th Cir. 2010). The Court addresses each element in turn.

i. Disabled Within the Meaning of the ADA
A "disability" is any "physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). A "major life activity" includes walking. Id. § 12102(2)(A). Here, it is undisputed [*6]  that Plaintiff is paralyzed from the waist down and is unable to walk. SUF ¶ 1. Accordingly, Plaintiff has established that he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA.

ii. Owning, Leasing, or Operating a Place of Public Accommodation
A "place of public accommodation" includes "grocery store[s]" and any "other sales or rental establishment." 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(E). Here, it is undisputed that each Defendant either owns, leases, or operates the Store. SUF ¶¶ 3, 4. And the Store sells alcoholic beverages as well as various snack and grocery items. See Dkt. # 37-4, Ex. 2; Dkt. # 37-5, Ex. 3. The store is therefore a "place of public accommodation" because it is a sales establishment. See 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(E). As a result, Plaintiff has established that Defendants owned, leased, or operated a place of public accommodation.

iii. Denial of Public Accommodations on the Basis of Disability
The final element requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that he or she was "discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment . . . of any place of public accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Discrimination includes a defendant's "failure to remove architectural barriers . . . where such removal is readily achievable." Id. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). Courts rely in [*7]  part on the ADA Accessibility Guidelines ("ADAAG") to determine whether a plaintiff has adequately identified an architectural barrier. Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.), Inc., 779 F.3d 1001, 1006 (9th Cir. 2015). Removal of an identified architectural barrier is "readily achievable" if it is "easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense." 42 U.S.C. § 12181(9). A plaintiff bears the "initial burden at summary judgment of plausibly showing that the cost of removing an architectural barrier does not exceed the benefits under the particular circumstances." Lopez v. Catalina Channel Express, Inc., 974 F.3d 1030, 1035 (9th Cir. 2020).
Here, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants' self-service shelves are too narrow to comply with ADAAG standards and thus present an architectural barrier to access. Mot. 7:1-9. The facts are undisputed: (1) while shopping at the Store in January 2021, Plaintiff identified several paths of travel that were too narrow for him to traverse, SUF ¶ 6; (2) Plaintiff's investigator returned to the Store the following week and found that many aisles ranged from between 25 and 31 inches wide, id. ¶¶ 7-8; and (3) in August 2021, Plaintiff's CASp expert returned to the Store and identified that the only remaining non-compliant aisle was one in front of the beverage refrigerator, which measured only 27.5 [*8]  inches wide, id. ¶¶ 9-10. The ADAAG provide that "[t]he clear width of an accessible route shall be 36 in[ches]." See 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. A, § 4.3.3. Accordingly, the Store's 27.5-inch-wide beverage refrigerator aisle does not comply with ADAAG standards, see id., and is therefore an architectural barrier to access, see Chapman, 779 F.3d at 1006.
Plaintiff also claims that removing the barrier is "readily achievable" by widening the beverage refrigerator aisle to 36 inches. Mot. 7:11-8:17. Again, the facts are undisputed. The merchandise display racks currently restrict the width of the Store's beverage refrigerator aisle, and widening the aisle could be accomplished by simply moving the display racks. See Declaration of Soyoung Ward, Dkt. # 37-7, ¶¶ 7-8. Moving display racks appears to be "readily achievable" because it can likely "be carried out without much difficulty or expense." 42 U.S.C. § 12181(9). Moreover, the Code of Federal Regulations indicates that moving or rearranging display racks is generally a "readily achievable" fix. See 28 C.F.R. 36.304(b)(4). Plaintiff has therefore plausibly shown that Defendants' minimal expense to move the display racks is outweighed by the benefit Plaintiff and other individuals who share his disability would receive by having proper access [*9]  to all aisles in the Store. See Lopez, 974 F.3d at 1035. Accordingly, Plaintiff has established the third and final element of his ADA claim—that he was denied public accommodations on the basis of his disability.
In sum, Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish each element of his ADA claim, and there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
IV. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Further, the Court ORDERS Plaintiff to prepare a judgment consistent with this order to be filed with the Court no later than January 28, 2022.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
