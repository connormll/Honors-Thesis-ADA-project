Opinion



ORDER ON MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
This matter is before the Court on a Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 27), filed by Defendant US Bank National Association (US Bank) on July 7, 2014. Plaintiff Diane Callahan filed a Resistance (ECF No. 32) to the Motion for Summary Judgment on July 29, 2014. US Bank filed a Reply on August 8, 2014. Also pending is a Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Declaration (ECF No. 35), filed by Defendant in conjunction with its Reply on August 8, 2014.
The Court held a hearing on these motions on August 21, 2014. Blake Parker appeared on Plaintiff's behalf, with Plaintiff also personally present. Britt Teply and Karin Johnson appeared on Defendant's behalf.
The parties have unanimously consented to proceed before a U.S. Magistrate Judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). This matter is currently set for a five-day jury trial [*2]  on October 13, 2014, with a final pretrial conference on October 2, 2014. The pending motions are fully submitted. After carefully reviewing the parties' submissions and arguments, the Court finds and orders as follows.

I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party "shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact exists if a reasonable factfinder could return a verdict for the non-moving party. See Chao v. Barbeque Ventures, LLC, 547 F.3d 938, 941 (8th Cir. 2008). "The non-moving party receives the benefit of all reasonable inferences supported by the evidence, but has 'the obligation to come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Atkinson v. City of Mountain View, Mo., 709 F.3d 1201, 1207 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Dahl v. Rice Cnty., Minn., 621 F.3d 740, 743 (8th Cir. 2010)); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). On a motion for summary judgment, the Court views all the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Popp Telecom, Inc. v. Am. Sharecom, Inc., 361 F.3d 482, 487 (8th Cir. 2004).
"There is no 'discrimination case exception' to the application of summary judgment, which is a useful pretrial tool to determine whether any case, including one alleging discrimination, merits a trial." Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031, 1043 (8th Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted). "[T]rial courts should not 'treat discrimination differently from other ultimate [*3]  questions of fact.'" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 524, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)).

II. FACTS
The following facts are either undisputed or viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the non-moving party.
Defendant is in the business of banking, and operates a number of banks in and around Dubuque, Iowa.1 Beginning on August 1, 2008, Plaintiff worked as a Branch Manager for Defendant's John F. Kennedy (JFK) Branch in Dubuque. Plaintiff was the sole manager of the JFK Branch, and supervised approximately fifteen branch employees. Plaintiff was responsible for leading, motivating, and directing her branch employees to provide customer service commensurate with Defendant's standards. Plaintiff was also responsible for maintaining and expanding Defendant's customer base in her area through marketing and community involvement. Amy Breitfelder, District Manager, was Plaintiff's supervisor throughout her employment with Defendant.
In mid-2010, Plaintiff was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). From July 30 to August 23, 2010, Plaintiff took approved medical leave, pursuant to her rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), due to her RA. Plaintiff also took approved FMLA leave due solely to her RA from May 12 [*4]  to May 22, 2011, and October 7 to November 21, 2011. In March 2012, Plaintiff underwent an emergency hysterectomy, and took approved FMLA from March 28 to April 25, 2012, as a result. Plaintiff again took approved FMLA leave from May 12 to May 21, 2012, as a result of her RA. The Hartford Disability Claim Operations (The Hartford) managed FMLA leave for Defendant. To certify requests for FMLA leave, Plaintiff only needed to submit medical records to The Hartford, and not to Defendant. For each period of approved leave, Plaintiff received a notice from The Hartford that she had been approved to take FMLA leave for a specified period of time. Plaintiff's last correspondence from The Hartford in the record is a letter dated July 11, 2012, in which The Hartford denied a request by Plaintiff to use twelve hours of intermittent FMLA leave on June 11 and 12, 2012, for lack of documentation.
From May 2011 to February 2012, Plaintiff was prescribed a subcutaneous medication known as Humira™ to treat her RA. Humira™ caused Plaintiff to have a severe reaction that rendered her unable to work for one day after she administered her weekly Humira™ injection. After she began experiencing this reaction, [*5]  Plaintiff began administering her weekly Humira™ injection each Saturday, so that she would be able to return to work each Monday. Plaintiff's extended absences from work were due to flare-ups of her RA, not due to her reaction to Humira™. In February 2012, Plaintiff asked her treating rheumatologist to discontinue Humira™ because of her reaction to it.
During Plaintiff's approved FMLA leave in March, April, and May 2012, Julie Florez, Branch Manager at Defendant's Dubuque Main Branch, covered Plaintiff's branch management responsibilities at the JFK Branch. On May 22, 2012, the day Plaintiff returned from her last period of FMLA leave, Bretifelder and Florez met with Plaintiff. At this meeting, Breitfelder handed Plaintiff a document titled "New Model at JFK." See Pl. App. 77-78, ECF No. 32-3. This document outlined that at the JFK Branch, among other things, the Teller Coordinator "will work two Saturdays per month," the Sales and Service Manager "will work one of the remaining Saturdays per month," and the "Branch Manager will work one of the remaining Saturdays per month." Pl. App. 78. The plan provided employees "[o]ne day off during the week to offset working on Saturdays." Pl. [*6]  App. 78. Breitfelder decided that the JFK Branch would implement the New Model, including requiring Plaintiff to work one Saturday per month. Before the New Model was implemented, Plaintiff did not work on Saturdays. She was the only Branch Manager in a branch that was open on Saturdays, under Breitfelder's supervision, who did not regularly work Saturdays. Plaintiff received the New Model at JFK from Breitfelder at their May 22, 2012 meeting, and left the meeting without objecting to the requirement that she work one Saturday per month.
On June 13, 2012, Plaintiff approached Breitfelder after a pair of meetings they both attended, and told Breitfelder that she would not be able to work Saturdays under the New Model because of her RA and medication side effects. Also in June 2012, Bretifelder and Plaintiff went together to a fast food restaurant, where Breitfelder told Plaintiff that in light of Plaintiff's RA, the best course of action may be to find another option for Plaintiff at US Bank. Breitfelder did not take steps to transfer Plaintiff to another position with US Bank.
After discontinuing Humira™ in February 2012, Plaintiff did not start a new course of medication for her RA [*7]  until July 2012. Between February and July 2012, Plaintiff and her treating rheumatologist had ongoing discussions about starting a different medication for her RA. Plaintiff was prescribed Enbrel™—another subcutaneous medication for RA— on July 17, 2012; Plaintiff was to take Enbrel™ weekly, and her treating rheumatologist did not require that the shot be administered on any particular day of the week. On July 19, 2012, a Thursday, Plaintiff administered her first dose of Enbrel™ at her rheumatologist's office. There is no evidence that Plaintiff missed any work because of side effects from her first dose of Enbrel™.
On July 18, 2012, the day after Plaintiff was prescribed Enbrel™, Rachel Hauger, a Human Resources employee for Defendant, called Plaintiff and they spoke on the telephone.2 Hauger asked Plaintiff why she could not work Saturdays, and Plaintiff responded that she had a personal commitment; Plaintiff did not convey any information to Hauger about her plans for administering Enbrel™, or anticipated side effects. Hauger testified that she "ascribed [sic] to [Plaintiff] that we needed to have a process to understand if she needs some sort of accommodation and we need to understand [*8]  her limitations and expectations for absences." Hauger Dep. 26:20-25, Pl. App. 40. Hauger testified that Plaintiff responded by saying that "she would check with her doctor about outlining expectations or limitations." Hauger Dep. 27:1-4, Pl. App. 40. Plaintiff does not contest Hauger's account of this phone call. See supra text and authorities accompanying note 2.
Plaintiff was scheduled to work her first Saturday under the New Model on July 28, 2012. On Wednesday, July 25, 2012, Breitfelder called Plaintiff on the phone.3 Plaintiff swore to the following account of the conversation and its aftermath:
[Breitfelder] asked what my plans were for Saturday. I again told her that I was scheduled to take my shot of Enbrel. She knew, because we had previously discussed it, that I had been injected the prior Thursday, July 19, 2012. I told her that because of taking the shot I would be unavailable to work on Saturday because I would be sick. Her response was that she needed to discuss the matter further with HR in Minneapolis. Later, Breitfelder again called me requesting that I come to her office at US Bank, main branch in downtown Dubuque. I went to her office. Rachel Hauger [*9]  was already on the telephone. Hauger said that it was required that I work on Saturday and that if I were not going to work I would be discharged. Breitfelder then asked: "Are you going to be able to work on Saturday?" and I responded: "You know I can't work on Saturdays."
Callahan Decl. ¶ 8, Pl. App. 82. Plaintiff's employment was immediately terminated during the July 25, 2012 phone call with Breitfelder and Hauger.
On May 28, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Petition in the Iowa District Court for Clinton County. Plaintiff's Petition asserted four causes of action: violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA),4 disability discrimination under the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA),5 unpaid wages under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and unpaid wages under Iowa Code Chapter 91A. On July 18, 2013, Defendant timely6 filed a Notice of Removal (ECF No. 1) in this Court, asserting that the Court has original subject-matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. On August 23, 2013, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint (ECF No. 8), re-pleading all of the causes of action asserted in her state-court petition, and adding a claim for disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).7
On June 30, 2014, [*10]  the parties stipulated to dismissal with prejudice of Plaintiff's wage claims under both the FLSA and Iowa Code Chapter 91A. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii); Stipulation at 1-2, ECF No. 26. On July 7, 2014, Defendant filed its Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 27).

III. MOTION TO STRIKE
On August 8, 2014, Defendant filed—with its Reply to Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Resistance—a Motion to Strike (ECF No. 35) Plaintiff's Declaration filed at pages 80-82 of Plaintiff's Appendix to her Summary Judgment Resistance. Defendant argues that the Declaration must be stricken because it is undated, and that the Court further should strike the Declaration because it contains passages that contradict Plaintiff's deposition testimony.
On August 18, 2014, Plaintiff filed a Response (ECF No. 36) to the Motion to Strike, including a copy of the Declaration dated "7/28/14." Decl. at 3, ECF No. 36-1. Plaintiff argues that the failure to date the Declaration was cured by filing the dated copy, and that the Court in any event is not required to strike an undated Declaration. Plaintiff also argues that no part of her Declaration actually contradicts her deposition testimony.
This Court exercises discretion over whether to admit contested evidence into [*11]  the record on summary judgment. See Davis v. U.S. Bancorp, 383 F.3d 761, 765 (8th Cir. 2004). Any matter required to be proven by affidavit "may, with like force and effect, be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by the unsworn declaration . . . subscribed . . . as true under penalty of perjury, and dated . . . ." 28 U.S.C. § 1746 (2012).
The Court finds that Plaintiff's submission of a dated version of her Declaration sufficiently indicates the time period in which Plaintiff executed it to satisfy the dating requirement of 28 U.S.C. § 1746. See Cowden v. BNSF Ry. Co., 975 F. Supp. 2d 1005, 2013 WL 5442952, at *5 (E.D. Mo. Sept. 30, 2013) (citing Peters v. Lincoln Elec. Co., 285 F.3d 456, 475 (6th Cir. 2002)).
The Court finds that most of the paragraphs that Defendant seeks to strike as contradictory with Plaintiff's deposition testimony are immaterial to deciding the Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court finds that Paragraph 8 of the Declaration, which must be addressed for the Motion for Summary Judgment, is not inconsistent with Plaintiff's other, albeit more vague, testimony about what she had told Breitfelder. Plaintiff testified in her first deposition that she had at some point explicitly told Breitfelder that she would be unable to work Saturdays due to taking Enbrel™ shots. Although Plaintiff did not testify that she told Breitfelder this in a phone call on July [*12]  25, 2012, that preceded her meeting with Breitfelder and Hauger, she never testified (1) that such a phone call did not take place, (2) that she never told Bretifelder that she was unable to work Saturdays because of Enbrel™, or (3) that the July 25, 2012 phone call where Breitfelder asked Plaintiff to come to her office was the only phone call between them on that date.
No material portions of Plaintiff's Declaration actually contradict any of her deposition testimony. Defendant's Motion to Strike (ECF No. 35) is denied.

IV. SUMMARY JUDGMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Plaintiff asserts two theories on her claims of disability discrimination: (1) that Defendant terminated her because of her disability, in violation of the ADAAA and the ICRA; and (2) that Defendant failed to accommodate her known limitations, as required by the ADAAA and the ICRA. On her remaining claim, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant interfered with her exercise of rights under the FMLA.

A. Disability Discrimination
The ADAAA provides that "[n]o covered entity8 shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, [*13]  employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ICRA provides that "[i]t shall be an unfair and discriminatory practice for any person9 to . . . discharge any employee, or to otherwise discriminate in employment against any . . . employee because of the . . . disability of such . . . employee . . . ." Iowa Code § 216.6(1)(a) (2013) (footnote added). "Where, as here, the parties do not dispute the application of federal analysis, disability claims under the ICRA are generally analyzed in accord with the ADA." Gretillat v. Care Initiatives, 481 F.3d 649, 652 (8th Cir. 2007) (citing McElroy v. State, 703 N.W.2d 385, 391 (Iowa 2005)).
"A plaintiff seeking relief under the ADA must show (1) [s]he is a disabled person as defined by the ADA, (2) [s]he is qualified to perform the essential functions of h[er] job with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action because of h[er] disability." St. Martin v. City of St. Paul, 680 F.3d 1027, 1032 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Lors v. Dean, 595 F.3d 831, 834 (8th Cir. 2010)). Under the ADAAA, discrimination includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business [*14]  of such covered entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "In order to determine whether an accommodation is necessary, and if so, what that accommodation may be, the employer and employee must engage in the 'interactive process.'" E.E.O.C. v. Prod. Fabricators, Inc., 763 F.3d 963, 2014 WL 3971477, at *5 (8th Cir. Aug. 15, 2014) (quoting Peyton v. Fred's Stores of Ark., Inc., 561 F.3d 900, 903 (8th Cir.2009)).
To show that the employer failed to participate in the interactive process, the employee must show:
1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith.
Id. (quoting Peyton, 561 F.3d at 902).
Defendant concedes, for purposes of its Motion for Summary Judgment, that Plaintiff was disabled under the meaning of the ADA and the ICRA, that Plaintiff was qualified to perform the essential functions of her position with Defendant, and that Plaintiff's termination was an adverse employment action. Defendant argues, though, that Plaintiff was not terminated because of her disability.
Plaintiff may survive summary judgment by presenting direct evidence that she was terminated because of her disability, or by raising an inference of [*15]  discriminatory intent under the burden-shifting approach from McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See St. Martin, 680 F.3d at 1032-33.
Plaintiff argues that the record contains direct evidence of disability discrimination, because "[t]he Defendant[] assert[s] the only reason that Callahan was discharged was because she said that she could not work on Saturdays due to taking shots for her RA." Pl. Br. at 14, ECF No. 32-4.
Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant created a fiction: that a branch manager needed to be present on Saturday, knowing that Plaintiff could not meet that criteri[on]. [Plaintiff also asserts that] Defendant created this fiction believing that Callahan had exceeded her entitlement to FMLA-required leave, and that US Bank could discharge plaintiff without the protection of the federal and state laws.
Pl. Br. at 9. "Direct evidence is that which shows 'a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision, sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.'" St. Martin, 680 F.3d at 1033 (quoting Griffith v. City of Des Moines, 387 F.3d 733, 736 (8th Cir. 2004)).
No reasonable jury could find that Defendant implemented the New Model's Saturday rotation with the intention that Plaintiff would be subject to discharge [*16]  because her disability would not allow her to work on Saturdays. There is no evidence in the record that Breitfelder knew at the time she implemented the New Model of Plaintiff's plans to start taking Enbrel™, or of Plaintiff's expectation that Enbrel™ would render her unable to work Saturdays. Further, Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant required other Branch Managers to work Saturdays if their branches were open. Although Plaintiff seems to contest whether it was necessary to Defendant's business that she be present on Saturdays, no reasonable jury could find that a discriminatory animus against Plaintiff motivated Defendant to implement the Saturday work requirement. Accordingly, Defendant's implementation and enforcement of the New Model's Saturday rotation requirement is not direct evidence of discrimination. See St. Martin, 680 F.3d at 1033; see also Hutson v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 63 F.3d 771, 781 (8th Cir. 1995) (citations omitted) ("[T]he employment-discrimination laws have not vested in the federal courts the authority to sit as super-personnel departments reviewing the wisdom or fairness of the business judgments made by employers, except to the extent that those judgments involve intentional discrimination.").
Absent direct evidence, Plaintiff must introduce [*17]  evidence under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting approach showing that she was disabled, qualified, and suffered an adverse employment action. See St. Martin, 680 F.3d at 1032-33 (citing Lors, 595 F.3d at 834) (holding that under burden-shifting approach, Plaintiff "must allege facts supporting the underlying elements of [the] ADA claim"). If Plaintiff can meet this prima facie case, Defendant has the burden "to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action." Id. at 1033 (citing Lors, 595 F.3d at 834). If Defendant meets that burden, Plaintiff must then show that Defendant's proffered reason was pretext for discrimination. See id. (citing Lors, 595 F.3d at 834).
Defendant has essentially conceded Plaintiff's entire prima facie case. Defendant has, though, proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for discharging Plaintiff: that she would not work Saturdays. Plaintiff contests this as a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her termination because she asserts that she was unable to work Saturdays due to the need to take Enbrel™ for her RA. Although Plaintiff's June 13, 2012 and July 25, 2012 discussions with Breitfelder gave Breitfelder a reason to believe that Plaintiff could not work on Saturdays because she would be sick from taking Enbrel™, asking [*18]  whether Defendant's refusal to excuse Plaintiff from missing a work day required by a schedule implemented without discriminatory intent is really asking whether Defendant failed to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation. Cf. US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 397, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002) ("By definition any special 'accommodation' requires the employer to treat an employee with a disability differently, i.e., preferentially. And the fact that the difference in treatment violates an employer's disability-neutral rule cannot by itself place the accommodation beyond the [ADA]'s potential reach.").
Here, the parties agree that Defendant terminated Plaintiff because she stated that she would not work on Saturday, July 28, 2012, or any other Saturday. Plaintiff told Breitfelder in June 2012 that side effects of medication used to treat her disabling condition were the reason she objected to working Saturdays under the New Model. Although she had not been taking any medication for RA since February 2012, Plaintiff anticipated that she would be prescribed new medication by July 2012. But when Hauger called Plaintiff on July 18, 2012, and requested information about why Plaintiff objected to working Saturdays, Plaintiff denied having any limitations [*19]  that kept her from working all Saturdays. Plaintiff admitted in her deposition that her physician did not prescribe that she take Enbrel™ on any particular day of the week, and admitted that it would have been possible for her to change the day she administered the shot in a week where she was scheduled to work Saturday. In fact, as of July 18, 2012, Plaintiff had not yet had a dose of Enbrel™, so she could not predict its side effects, if any. Her first dose was July 19, 2012; if taken strictly weekly, her second dose would have been on Thursday, July 26, 2012. By failing to disclose the different options she had for administering Enbrel™—or more details about the side effects she expected from her second dose of Enbrel™—in her discussions with Breitfelder and Hauger, Plaintiff "stalled the interactive process." Russell v. TG Missouri Corp., 340 F.3d 735, 742 (8th Cir. 2003) (holding ADA plaintiff previously limited by physician to eight-hour workday, not defendant employer, "stalled the interactive process" by not following up to correct employer's assumptions that she was capable of working more than forty hours per week after she learned that she was scheduled to work an extra shift on a Saturday). Because Plaintiff never provided Defendant [*20]  with any specific information regarding the side effects she expected to experience from her second dose of Enbrel™, even when asked by Hauger, or after her first dose on July 19, 2012, no reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff's discharge was pretext for intentional discrimination, or that Defendant failed to engage in good faith in an interactive process to try to accommodate Plaintiff's alleged limitations. See E.E.O.C. v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp., Inc., 491 F.3d 790, 795 (8th Cir. 2007) ("[T]he employee must provide relevant details of his disability and, if not obvious, the reason that his disability requires an accommodation."). Even in Plaintiff's first July 25, 2012 phone call with Breitfelder, Plaintiff only reiterated that she was scheduled to take Enbrel™ on July 28, 2012, and "would be unavailable to work on Saturday because [she] would be sick." Callahan Decl. ¶ 8, Pl. App. 82. This only restated to Breitfelder the vague information that Breitfelder knew before Hauger attempted to get Plaintiff to clarify why she thought she could not work Saturdays. No reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff gave Defendant sufficient information to determine whether she actually could not work on Saturdays because of a disability, and if so, how that limitation [*21]  could have been accommodated. Accordingly, no reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff's termination for refusing to work Saturdays was pretext for disability discrimination, or that Defendant failed to provide Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation. As a matter of law, Defendant is entitled to judgment on Plaintiff's claims under the ADAAA and the ICRA.

B. Family and Medical Leave
Under the FMLA, "an eligible employee shall be entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period . . . [b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). Leave because of a serious health condition may be taken intermittently. See id. § 2612(b)(1).
The Eighth Circuit "recognize[s] two types of claims under the FMLA: interference and retaliation claims." Ebersole v. Novo Nordisk, Inc., 758 F.3d 917, 923 (8th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). Plaintiff asserts that Defendant interfered with her exercise of FMLA rights because she was entitled to at least one more leave day at the time her employment was terminated, and she made a sufficient request for leave to Breitfelder, which was denied.
It is "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt [*22]  to exercise, any right provided under" the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1) (2012). "An employee can prevail under an interference theory if [s]he was denied substantive rights under the FMLA for a reason connected with h[er] FMLA leave." Ballato v. Comcast Corp., 676 F.3d 768, 772 (8th Cir. 2012) (quoting Stallings v. Hussman Corp., 447 F.3d 1041, 1050 (8th Cir. 2006)).
To prevail on a claim of FMLA interference, an employee must "show that the employer denied the employee entitlements under the FMLA." Quinn v. St. Louis Cnty., 653 F.3d 745, 753 (8th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). There is evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff was entitled to eight more hours of FMLA leave at the time her employment was terminated. Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not provide sufficient notice of her intention to take leave under the FMLA. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff did not make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment to not unduly disrupt Defendant's business operations.10
In any case where the necessity for leave [because of a serious health condition] is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employee . . . shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as to not disrupt unduly the operations of the employer, subject to the approval of the health care provider of the employee . . . .
29 U.S.C. § 2612(e)(2)(A).
[The employee also] shall provide [*23]  the employer with not less than 30 days' notice, before the date the leave is to begin, of the employee's intention to take leave [for a serious health condition], except that if the date of the treatment requires leave to begin in less than 30 days, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable.
Id. § 2612(e)(2)(B). "When an employee becomes aware of a need for FMLA leave less than 30 days in advance, it should be practicable for the employee to provide notice of the need for leave either the same day or the next business day." 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(b). "In all cases, however, the determination of when an employee could practicably provide notice must take into account the individual facts and circumstances." Id. If an employee does not consult with the employer regarding scheduling planned treatment, "the employer may initiate discussions with the employee and require the employee to attempt to make such arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care provider." Id.
"An employee shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave." Id. § 825.302(c). "Depending on the situation, such information [*24]  may include that a condition renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the job . . . ." Id.
When an employee seeks leave due to a FMLA-qualifying reason, for which the employer has previously provided FMLA-protected leave, the employee must specifically reference the qualifying reason for leave or the need for FMLA leave. In all cases, the employer should inquire further of the employee if it is necessary to have more information about whether FMLA leave is being sought by the employee, and obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken. In the case of medical conditions, the employer may find it necessary to inquire further to determine if the leave is because of a serious health condition and may request medical certification to support the need for such leave.
Id.
Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there is no genuine dispute of material fact over whether her Enbrel™ injections were planned treatment. Plaintiff admitted that she could choose which day of the week she would administer injections, and that she could change which day she did so on weeks that she was scheduled to work Saturday. There is no evidence in the record from which [*25]  a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff consulted with Breitfelder or Hauger about how she might plan her Enbrel™ injections in a way that would not preclude her from meeting any of Defendant's attendance expectations of her as a Branch Manager. Even when Hauger initiated discussions with her about her reasons for objecting to the New Model's Saturday rotation, Plaintiff simply stated in a conclusory manner that she could not work Saturdays. Even Plaintiff's statements to Breitfelder that she would be "sick" and unable to work Saturdays because of taking Enbrel™ could not be found by a reasonable jury to have notified Defendant that Plaintiff's side effects from Enbrel™ rendered Plaintiff unable to work on all Saturdays or otherwise necessitated FMLA leave. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that Plaintiff made any attempt to submit a request to The Hartford for leave on July 28, 2012.
Because no reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff provided Defendant with enough information to determine whether her blanket request to not work any Saturdays was due to an FMLA-qualifying condition, or that Plaintiff made any request for FMLA leave to The Hartford for July 28, 2012, [*26]  she has not raised a genuine dispute of material fact over whether Defendant denied her a right to which she was entitled under the FMLA. As a matter of law, Defendant is entitled to judgment on Plaintiff's claim of FMLA interference.

V. CONCLUSION
Because Plaintiff filed a dated copy of her Declaration submitted with her Summary Judgment Resistance, and the Declaration did not contain any assertions that actually contradicted Plaintiff's deposition testimony, Defendant's Motion to Strike (ECF No. 35) is denied.
Because Plaintiff has not presented direct evidence of disability discrimination, and has not raised a genuine dispute of material fact over whether Defendant terminated her employment because of her disability or failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination, pleaded as her second and fifth causes of action in her Amended Complaint.
Because Plaintiff has not raised a genuine dispute of material fact over whether she was entitled to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), or over whether she provided Defendant with adequate notice of her intention to exercise rights [*27]  under the FMLA, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim of interference with FMLA rights, pleaded as her first cause of action in her Amended Complaint.
Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted. Plaintiff's remaining claims are dismissed with prejudice. The Clerk of Court shall enter final judgment in favor of Defendant. The Final Pretrial Conference scheduled for October 2, 2014, and the Jury Trial scheduled to begin October 13, 2014, are cancelled. Plaintiff's Motion in Limine (ECF No. 38) is denied as moot.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
Dated this 24th day of September, 2014.
