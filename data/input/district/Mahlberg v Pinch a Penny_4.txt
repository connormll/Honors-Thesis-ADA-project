Opinion



Order
This matter is before the Court on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 18) Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. 1). In ruling on this motion, the Court has considered Plaintiff's Response in Opposition. (Doc. 20).

I. Background1
Plaintiff Raymond T. Mahlberg ("Mahlberg") is a visually impaired, disabled person who relies on "screen-reading" software to read websites and other online content through his computer. Defendant Pinch-a-Penny Inc. ("Pincha-Penny") owns, operates, and franchises a chain of retail pool supply stores. Pinch-a-Penny also owns and operates a website and a mobile e-commerce application ("app"). The website and app provide information about Pinch-a-Penny's physical stores, provide product information, and allow users to order and purchase Pinch-a-Penny's products. The website and app are not compatible with screen-reading software.
Mahlberg sued Pinch-a-Penny alleging that its website violates the public accommodation provisions under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Mahlberg seeks a declaratory [*2]  judgment and injunctive relief. Pinch-a-Penny now moves to dismiss Mahlberg's claim.

II. Legal Standard

A. Article III Standing
To have standing under Article III of the Constitution, a plaintiff must satisfy three elements: "The plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision." Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547, 194 L. Ed. 2d 635 (2016). The party invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts has the burden of establishing each element. Id.
To establish standing to seek injunctive relief, the "injury in fact" element requires the plaintiff to demonstrate a "sufficient likelihood" of being affected by the unlawful conduct in the future. Wooden v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. Of Ga., 247 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 2001). In the context of an ADA Title III claim, this is generally accomplished by showing that the plaintiff intends to return to the property at issue. The Eleventh Circuit has rejected arguments that a tester's motive for a past (or future) visit to a place of public accommodation precludes him or her from having standing to seek injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA. See Houston v. Marod Supermarkets, Inc., 733 F.3d 1323, 1332-34 (11th Cir. 2013). On a defendant's motion to dismiss, the Court must evaluate standing based on the facts alleged in the complaint. See, [*3]  e.g., Shotz v. Cates, 256 F.3d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir. 2001).

B. Failure to State a Claim
In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court must view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, see, e.g., Jackson v. Okaloosa Cnty., 21 F.3d 1531, 1534 (11th Cir. 1994), and must limit its consideration to the pleadings and any exhibits attached thereto. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c); see also GSW, Inc. v. Long Cnty., 999 F.2d 1508, 1510 (11th Cir. 1993). The Court will liberally construe the complaint's allegations in the Plaintiff's favor. See Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 421, 89 S. Ct. 1843, 23 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1969). However, "conclusory allegations, unwarranted factual deductions or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal." Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 326 F.3d 1183, 1185 (11th Cir. 2003).
In reviewing a complaint on a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), "courts must be mindful that the Federal Rules require only that the complaint contain 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" United States v. Baxter Int'l, Inc., 345 F.3d 866, 880 (11th Cir. 2003) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)). This is a liberal pleading requirement, one that does not require a plaintiff to plead with particularity every element of a cause of action. Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. for Choice, Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 683 (11th Cir. 2001). However, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the grounds for his or her entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 554-555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The complaint's factual allegations "must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative [*4]  level," id. at 555, and cross "the line from conceivable to plausible." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 680, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).

III. Analysis
Pinch-a-Penny moves to dismiss the Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of Article III standing and under Rule 12(b)(6) for failing to state a claim. The Court will address each argument in turn.

A. Standing
Pinch-a-Penny argues that the Complaint fails to allege an immediate threat of injury sufficient to support standing to seek injunctive relief. Pinch-a-Penny contends that the fact that Mahlberg has not visited a Pinch-a-Penny store undermines standing here. The Eleventh Circuit has identified four factors to consider when determining whether a plaintiff has standing to pursue a Title III ADA claim: "(1) the proximity of the defendant's business to the plaintiff's residence; (2) the plaintiff's past patronage of the defendant's business; (3) the definitiveness of the plaintiff's plan to return; and (4) the frequency of the plaintiff's travel near the defendant's business." Houston v. Marod Supermarkets, Inc., 733 F.3d 1323, 1337 n.6 (11th Cir. 2013).
Mahlberg resides in Orlando, Florida and he alleges that there are Pinch-a-Penny stores "in his area." (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 10, 41). Although the Complaint does not specify the exact locations of Pinch-a-Penny's stores, the parties apparently do not dispute that there [*5]  are several located in Orlando, Florida. (See Doc. 18-3) (Pinch-a-Penny exhibit identifying 11 stores with Orlando addresses). Although Mahlberg has never visited a Pinch-a-Penny store, he alleges that he attempted to gather information from Pinch-a-Penny's website and that he plans to visit a physical store if the website is made accessible. (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 42, 60).
Mahlberg's allegations sufficiently present a "concrete and particularized" injury that is caused by Pinch-a-Penny's website and will continue if the website remains inaccessible. See Gil v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc.,F.3d, 993 F.3d 1266, 2021 WL 1289906, at *4 (11th Cir. 2021). Therefore, Mahlberg has standing to bring this case.2

B. ADA Accommodation Claim
Pinch-a-Penny also argues that the Complaint fails to state a public accommodation claim under Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12189 ("Title III"), which addresses "Public Accommodations and Services Operated by Private Entities." Title III provides that "[n]o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in any place of public accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Any person subjected to discrimination because of a disability in violation of Title III may bring a private action. 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a). To prevail on a Title III ADA claim, a plaintiff generally has the burden of proving (1) that he or she is an individual [*6]  with a disability; (2) that the defendant owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) that the defendant denied him or her full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities or privileges offered by the defendant (4) on the basis of his or her disability. Schiavo ex rel Schindler v. Schiavo, 358 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 1165 (M.D. Fla. 2005). The only relief available to plaintiffs suing under Title III of the ADA is injunctive relief. Houston, 733 F.3d at 1329.
Mahlberg alleges that Pinch-a-Penny's website violates Title III of the ADA because it is inaccessible to the visually impaired. Pinch-a-Penny contends that Mahlberg failed to sufficiently allege "that the inaccessible portions of the website 'hinders the full use and enjoyment' of [Pinch-a-Penny]'s facilities." (Doc. 18 at 17). The Eleventh Circuit in Gil v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. recently held "that websites are not a place of public accommodation under Title III of the ADA." Gil, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 10024, 993 F.3d 1266, 2021 WL 1289906, at *7. The Court acknowledged that Title III's public accommodation protection "covers both tangible barriers . . . and intangible barriers, such as eligibility requirements and screening rules or discriminatory policies and procedures that restrict a disabled person's ability to enjoy the defendant entity's goods, services and privileges." [*7]  Id. at *8 (quoting Rendon v. Valleycrest Prods., Ltd., 294 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir. 2002) (emphasis in original). While a website may contain an intangible barrier that violates Title III, the Court has firmly rejected any "nexus" theory for relief under Title III.3 Id. at *10.
An owner and operator of a place of public accommodation can violate Title III when disabled individuals are "excluded, denied services, segregated, or otherwise treated differently" because the owner failed to provide auxiliary aids and services necessary to remove an intangible barrier like an inaccessible website. Id. at *8. A plaintiff must establish that the "'auxiliary aids and services' are in fact 'necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated, or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids.'" Id. at *11 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii)) (emphasis in original).
The Eleventh Circuit has provided some guidance on when an intangible barrier violates Title III. For example, an intangible barrier violates Title III where it impedes a physical venue's "sole access point" and prevents a plaintiff "from 'accessing a privilege' of a physical place of public accommodation."4 Id. at *9 (citing Rendon v. Valleycrest Prods., Ltd., 294 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir. 2002)). The Court has also indicated that for websites, an important [*8]  factor is whether a website acts as a "point of sale" for a business's physical store. See id. at *9, 12.
The issue here is whether Mahlberg's Complaint sufficiently alleges that Pinch-a-Penny's website presents an intangible barrier that prevents Mahlberg from "'accessing a privilege' of a physical place of public accommodation."5 See id. According to the Complaint, Pinch-a-Penny's website provides "public information" regarding its store locations and sells Pinch-a-Penny's products. (Doc. 1 ¶ 35). Pinch-a-Penny also has an app which enables mobile device users to "get quotes and prices." (Doc. 1 ¶ 36). Mahlberg states that he "would like to be able to get a quote online and pick up at the Pinch-a-Penny's store." (Doc. 1 ¶ 38).
Although the Complaint alleges that customers can order products through Pinch-a-Penny's website, it is unclear how this function interacts with Pinch-a-Penny's physical store. Gil makes it clear that the simple fact that an inaccessible website provides information about a physical store cannot support a Title III claim. Gil, 993 F.3d 1266, 2021 WL 1289906, at *9. Without more detailed allegations regarding the "point of sale" function and how the absence of that function impedes Mahlberg's access to [*9]  the physical stores, the Complaint cannot state a claim for relief under Title III and it must be dismissed.

IV. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 18) is GRANTED. Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. 1) is DISMISSED without prejudice. If Plaintiff wishes to file an amended complaint, he may do so within twenty-one (21) days of the date of this Order.
DONE and ORDERED in Chambers, Orlando, Florida on April 20, 2021.
