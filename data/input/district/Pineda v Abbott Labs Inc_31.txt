CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: IN CHAMBERS ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [69]

I. Introduction and Procedural History
Plaintiff Ronald Pineda ("Pineda") filed this action in state court on March 7, [*2]  2018. Dkt. 1-1. Defendants Abbott Laboratories, Inc. and Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") removed the case on April 23, 2018. Dkt. 1. In a July 18, 2018 order, the Court denied Pineda's motion to remand and granted Abbott's motion to dismiss Defendant Alex Mazzenga. Dkt. 29. On October 1, 2018, the Court denied Pineda's motion for leave to take immediate interlocutory appeal. Dkt. 53. On October 29, 2018, Abbott moved for summary judgment. Dkt. 69. On December 6, 2018, the Court issued a text-only entry granting Abbott's motion for summary judgment and stating that a detailed order would issue. Dkt. 202.

II. Factual Background

A. Background on Pineda and Abbott
Pineda was born on December 10, 1961. Plaintiff's Reply to Defendants' Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("SUF"), Dkt. 121, Ex. B ¶ 1. Abbott hired Pineda in 1992 in an at-will capacity. Id. ¶ 2. In 2006, at the age of 44, Pineda was promoted to the position of Regional Account Manager ("RAM"), a position he held until his termination. Id. ¶ 7. As a RAM, Pineda serviced healthcare professionals, providing them with therapeutic nutrition research, information, and products. Id. Over time, however, Abbott adopted a new sales strategy [*3]  that shifted the sales organization toward executive-level selling, and so RAMs would engage with C-suite executives. Id. ¶ 9.
Abbott issues annual performance reviews to its employees that are generally prepared by an employee's direct supervisor. Id. ¶ 10. Employees also complete self-assessments and supervisors may provide a mid-year assessment. Id.

B. Pineda's History at Abbott

i. Under the Supervision of Kirk Arnold
From 2013 through mid-February 2015, Pineda reported to Kirk Arnold. Id. ¶ 20. Pineda testified that he and Arnold "got along very well." Id. ¶ 21.

1. 2013
In July 2013, Arnold allegedly told Pineda that younger employees have a "long runway" while older employees have a "short runway."1 Id. ¶ 24. Arnold gave Pineda an overall "Achieved Expectations" rating on Pineda's 2013 performance review. Id. ¶ 25.

2. 2014
Arnold gave Pineda an overall "Partially Achieved Expectations" rating on Pineda's 2014 performance review—a rating that indicates that an employee is not fully meeting expectations. Id. ¶ 28. Arnold noted in this review that "some improvement [was] required" in several tested competencies, including "Anticipate - Leader," "Build - Leader," and "Deliver Results - Leader." [*4]  Dkt. 71-8, Ex. 61. Furthermore, when compared to his peer RAMs with respect to certain sales goals, Pineda ranked 11/12 in the Protocols category and 12/12 in the Profitable Products category. Id.; SUF ¶ 29. In his overall "Manager's Assessment," Arnold stated:
[Pineda] has a solid understanding of customers & the market and he does a nice job with written communication and follow up. High level customer engagement, making difficult decisions, leveraging available team member resources, holding team members accountable for delivering results are areas in need of improvement. It's important that [Pineda] demonstrates immediate improvement in the areas identified in order to achieve expectations in 2015.
Dkt. 71-8, Ex. 61. The performance review also included Pineda's self-assessment score of 70.2%, which is the equivalent of a "Partially Achieved" rating or "some improvement required." Id.; SUF ¶ 30. Pineda did not dispute the 2014 performance review at the time. SUF ¶ 31.

ii. Under the Supervision of Frank Weiss (2015)
Following a corporate restructuring, from mid-February through August 2015 Pineda reported to Regional Sales Director Frank Weiss. Id. ¶ 33. Pineda stated that he initially [*5]  had a good working relationship with Weiss. Id. ¶ 35; Dkt. 71-1, Ex. 1 at 219:14-21. Pineda also acknowledges that Weiss never made negative comments about Pineda's age. SUF ¶ 36.
Weiss attended a sales meeting with Pineda in April 2015. Id. ¶ 39. Weiss sent Pineda a follow-up email on May 14, 2015, which summarized Weiss' impressions from the meeting. Weiss first stated that Pineda "did a really nice job putting the presentation together and including all the agenda items they were interested in as well," and he also wrote that Pineda "covered the quality partnership portion of their current contract effectively." Dkt. 71-11, Ex. 88. Then, Weiss proceeded to discuss "a few things that stood out as areas for development." Id. Weiss suggested that Pineda needed improvement in "anticipating customer needs" and in "calling on high level customers." Id. Weiss also observed that Pineda had made "non-verbal expressions," and "[o]n a number of occasions [had] sighed noticeably, which create[d] the wrong impression with the customer."2 Id. Weiss concluded his message by remarking that his "feedback [wa]s consistent with some of the feedback [Pineda had] received on [his] 2014" performance review. [*6]  Id. After receiving the May 14, 2015 email from Weiss, Pineda told Weiss for the first time that he had a medical condition that affected his breathing. Id. ¶ 41.
In May 2015, Weiss sought counsel from Abbott's Employee Relations ("ER") with respect to performance management for Pineda. Id. ¶ 44. After collaborating with ER, Weiss scheduled a one-on-one meeting with Pineda on June 18, 2015, wherein Weiss told Pineda that his overall rating for the year-to-date continued to be "Partially Achieved." Id. ¶ 45. Pineda interpreted this conversation to mean that Weiss did "not believe [Pineda] ha[d] the skills to be a regional account manager, and that [his] skills were suited more to being a therapeutic nutrition representative." Dkt. 71-1, Ex. 2 at 274:1-4.
Weiss gave Pineda a mid-year performance review in which Weiss ranked Pineda's performance as "Partially Achieved." Id. ¶ 47. Pineda was rated "ineffective" in several Leadership Competencies and "well below his peers" with respect to certain annual sales goals. Id. Weiss advised Pineda that "[s]ignificant improvement [wa]s needed in multiple areas in order to Achieve Expectations." Id.
Pineda alleges that after he received the 2015 [*7]  mid-year performance review he complained to Weiss that he felt he was being discriminated against because of his age. Id. ¶ 48. In addition, on August 3, 2015, Pineda submitted a written rebuttal to the mid-year performance review. Id. ¶ 50; Dkt. 71-5, Ex. 24. Pineda disputed the substance of the performance review; he made no mention of age discrimination, disability discrimination, a hostile work environment, or retaliation. SUF ¶ 50; Dkt. 71-5, Ex. 24.

iii. Under the Supervision of Yvonne Tanner
For the remainder of his employment at Abbott, from August 2015 to February 2017, Pineda reported to Yvonne Tanner, who had recently been promoted to Senior RAM. Id. ¶ 51. Pineda testified that he initially viewed Tanner's supervision "favorably" because it would be "better" to have a supervisor who was a former peer. Id. ¶ 52. Pineda also believed he initially had a good working relationship with Tanner. Id.

1. 2015
Tanner observed that Pineda had the same performance deficiencies identified by his two previous supervisors. Id. ¶ 55. Tanner also received feedback from other Abbott employees who criticized Pineda's performance.3 Id. ¶ 56. Although Pineda disputes the probative value of the feedback, [*8]  he does not dispute that it was made. Id.
In his 2015 performance review, Pineda again received an overall rating of "Partially Achieved." Id. ¶ 57. As in prior performance reviews, Pineda was advised that he needed improvement in several Leadership Competencies, as well as in his overall sales results. Id. ¶ 58. Although Pineda's self-assessment stated that he "believe[d] overall [that he had] achieved expectations," Pineda agreed that there was "room for improvement" with respect to some sales goals and that "[s]ome [i]mprovement [was] [r]equired" in the category of "Deliver Results — Leader." Dkt. 71-5, Ex. 27. Pineda also does not dispute that he was ranked 11/12 in certain sales goals in the first half of 2015. Id.; SUF ¶ 59.

2. 2016
On January 13 and 14, 2016, Tanner accompanied Pineda on a sales visit and provided him with feedback in the areas of preparation, customer intimacy, and emotional intelligence. SUF ¶ 62. During the field visit, Pineda also failed the Executive Enlive Certification, which was targeted to reinforce his executive level selling skills.4 Id. Tanner sent an email to Pineda on January 18, 2016, which presented her observations of the field visit.  [*9] Id. Tanner also advised Pineda on January 18, 2016 that he had failed the certification test. Id. Pineda did not object to his failure. Id. Instead, he responded to Tanner by "[t]hank[ing] [her] for the detailed feedback," which he considered "very helpful as [he] plan[ned] to recertify." Id. ¶ 63; Dkt. 71-5, Ex. 29. He also stated that he was attempting to "sharpen [his] executive presentation skills" by "looking at the programs offered through Skill Path and Lynda.com." Id. Pineda passed the recertification test on his next attempt. SUF ¶ 63.
On January 20, 2016, Tanner spoke with ER about Pineda's multi-year trend of poor performance, including his 2014 performance review, his 2015 mid-year performance review, and his 2015 performance review. Id. ¶ 64. After that discussion, Tanner drafted a performance management memorandum that urged Pineda's immediate improvement. Id. ¶ 65. Tanner emailed the performance management memorandum to Pineda on February 25, 2016. Id. ¶ 67. They were scheduled to discuss the matter on February 29, 2016. Id. However, on February 29, 2016, Pineda called out sick and requested a leave of absence effective on March 1, 2016, which Abbott approved. Id. ¶¶ 68, [*10]  76. At the time, Pineda informed Matrix (Abbott's third-party administrator) that he suffered from a panic disorder, anxiety, and high blood pressure.5 Id. ¶ 69. Pineda testified that this was the first time that he had told Matrix about his panic disorder, anxiety, and high blood pressure. Id.
On March 1, 2016, Pineda complained to ER that he was experiencing age discrimination, disability discrimination, and retaliation. Id. ¶ 70. In response, ER conducted an investigation, which involved interviewing Pineda and Weiss.6 Id. ¶ 71. The ER employee who conducted the investigation concluded that Pineda's claims were unfounded. Id. ¶ 73. She conveyed the findings to Pineda and closed the investigation on July 13, 2016. Id. ¶ 74. On July 28, 2016, Pineda filed a charge with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") and requested an immediate right-to-sue notice. Id. ¶ 126.
On August 10, 2016, Pineda returned to work7 with work restrictions that consisted of limited stooping, bending, sitting, lifting, pushing, pulling, and time off for medical appointments.8 Id. ¶ 77. Tanner issued Pineda an updated performance management memorandum on August 15, 2016, which Pineda [*11]  signed. Id. ¶ 79.
Tanner continued to coach Pineda on her ongoing concerns with his performance. Id. ¶ 80. For example, on August 30, 2016, Tanner counseled Pineda on leading, providing direction to team members, preparedness, and adapting. Id. On September 5, 2016, Pineda submitted another complaint to ER, this time alleging that Tanner created a "hostile work environment." Id. ¶ 81. In particular, Pineda testified that Tanner had humiliated him during a conference call by saying he "did everything wrong; all of this nee[ed] to be redone; [he] didn't do things to her satisfaction." Id.
Three days later, on September 8, 2016, Pineda went on a second medical leave.9 Id. ¶ 82. Abbott granted Pineda's request for a medical leave between September 8, 2016 and November 9, 2016. Id. ¶ 83. ER had not been able to interview Pineda yet about his new allegations. Id. ¶ 82.
On November 10, 2016, Pineda returned to work with work restrictions.10 Id. ¶ 85. Pineda had forwarded to Abbott a letter from his physician dated November 8, 2016, which stated that Pineda would need four temporary accommodations: (1) four-hour workdays through December 31, 2016; (2) "additional time to catch up to training [*12]  programs/meetings"; (3) have "large assignments [divided] into smaller tasks and steps"; and (4) have Abbott "[d]evelop strategies to deal with problems before the [sic] arise." Dkt. 71-3, Ex. 6. On November 17, 2016, Tanner and an ER employee had a conversation with Pineda to discuss Pineda's accommodation requests. SUF ¶ 87. Tanner and the ER employee agreed to make some accommodations to Pineda.11 Id. ¶ 88. On November 20, 2016, Pineda emailed Tanner and the ER employee to state that he would "comply with [Abbott's] requirement that [he] ramp up" to working full-time by December 1, 2016. Id. ¶ 90; Dkt. 71-7, Ex. 54. Furthermore, Pineda "[t]hank[ed] [Abbott] for accepting all the other accommodations requested by [his] doctors in the manner [they had] agreed to" in their prior conversation. SUF ¶ 90; Dkt. 71-7, Ex. 54.
In early December, Pineda submitted a new letter from his physician, which stated that she was "releasing Mr. Pineda to return to working 8 hours a day with no restrictions on December 1, 2016." SUF ¶ 91; Dkt. 71-3, Ex. 5. Pineda later testified that he "did not . . . disagree with what [his physician] wrote" in that letter. SUF ¶ 92; Dkt. 71-2, Ex. 4, [*13]  at 747:3-11. In December 2016, Pineda requested that Abbott conduct an ergonomic assessment, which Abbott agreed to do. SUF ¶ 93.
After Pineda returned from his second medical leave, ER resumed its investigation and interviewed Pineda regarding his September 2016 complaint. Id. ¶ 98. After completing the investigation, ER informed Pineda that his allegations were unsubstantiated and that the examples provided by him were instances of legitimate performance-related feedback. Id. ¶ 99.
On December 1, 2016, Tanner reissued the performance management memorandum, providing Pineda with an additional 90 days to correct his performance. Id. ¶ 94. According to the memorandum, "[f]ailure to demonstrate immediate, consistent[,] and sustained performance improvement could result in further corrective counseling, disciplinary action[,] or termination of [Pineda's] employment with Abbott at any point during or after the 90-day period." Id.; Dkt. 71-6, Ex. 36 at 3. In Pineda's 2016 performance review, Tanner gave Pineda a rating of below expectations (a "Partially Achieved" rating at 60%). Id. ¶ 96.

3. 2017
On January 23, 2017, midway through the 90-day period, Tanner gave Pineda a 45-day status report [*14]  advising him that he was not showing sufficient improvement. Id. ¶ 102. In response to the 45-day status report, Pineda complained to Tanner and ER that Tanner had used words in the report and during their conversations that had targeted his disability. Id. ¶ 103. In particular, Pineda complained that Tanner had characterized Pineda as "clunky," "mechanical," apprehensive," "anxious," and "confused," and that he had "fail[ed] to recognize" things and was "unable to adapt."12 Dkt. 71-6, Ex. 39. Pineda alleged that his "disability c[ould] be characterized by th[ose] words."13 Id. Based on Pineda's letter to Tanner, ER conducted an investigation and determined that the identified terms were intended to describe Pineda's performance and not his disability. SUF ¶ 106. The investigation also concluded that Abbott had provided a reasonable accommodation to all of Pineda's requests. Id.
As the 90-day period drew to a close, Tanner concluded that Pineda had not shown sufficient improvement. Id. ¶ 107. On February 13, 2017, Tanner provided ER with a "Final Review of Performance Post Delivery of Formal Documentation" for Pineda. Dkt. 71-14 ¶ 21. At the conclusion of this review, Tanner stated that [*15]  Pineda received a rating of "Not Successful with Meeting Expectations" and that she was requesting a review for termination. Id. An ER employee conducted an independent review of Tanner's recommendation and prepared an "ER Recommendation for Termination Worksheet," which recommended that Pineda's employment be terminated for "poor performance" and due to his "refusal to respond effectively to the extensive coaching and feedback that was given." Id. ¶ 108; Dkt. 71-14, Ex. 107. The termination was approved by four upper-level managers. SUF ¶ 109. On February 14, 2017, Pineda submitted an oral and written complaint regarding Tanner's use of the words "clunky," "confused," and "mechanical." Dkt. 121, Ex. A, at 10. On February 23, 2017, Abbott terminated Pineda's employment for poor performance. SUF ¶ 110.
On March 23, 2017, Pineda filed a second DFEH charge and requested an immediate right-to-sue notice. Id. ¶ 127. From the date of his termination until December 2017, Pineda received California Employment Development Department ("EDD") disability payments. Id. ¶ 134.

III. Legal Standard
Summary judgment should be granted where "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material [*16]  fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party "bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of . . . [the factual record that] demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party satisfies its initial burden, the non-moving party must demonstrate with admissible evidence that genuine issues of material fact exist. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-86, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) ("When the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56 . . . its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.").
A material fact for purposes of summary judgment is one that "might affect the outcome of the suit" under the applicable law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A genuine issue of material fact exists where "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. A court must draw all inferences from the facts in the non-movant's favor, id. at 255, but when the non-moving party's version of the facts is "blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, [the] court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling [*17]  on a motion for summary judgment." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007).

IV. Analysis

A. Violation of the FEHA (Claim 1)

1. Discrimination
Pineda raises claims for discrimination based on age and disability. Discrimination can be established either: (1) with direct evidence of discrimination or (2) on a presumption arising under a burden-shifting framework. See Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994). "Direct evidence" is "evidence which, if believed, proves the fact [of discriminatory animus] without inference or presumption." Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. 1998) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). In the context of age discrimination, for example, direct evidence could be evidence of a supervisor's calling an employee "old geezer" and "old fart." EEOC v. Pape Lift, Inc., 115 F.3d 676, 679, 683-84 (9th Cir. 1997).
Under the burden-shifting analysis, established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), the "plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of employment discrimination." Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc., 658 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 2011). Although the "prima facie burden is not onerous, [the plaintiff] must at least show actions taken by the employer from which one can infer . . . that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a [prohibited] discriminatory criterion." Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 355, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, "the burden shifts to the employer [*18]  to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions." Earl, 658 F.3d at 1112. "If the employer articulates a legitimate reason, the plaintiff must raise a triable issue that the employer's proffered reason is pretext for unlawful discrimination." Id. "[M]ere assertions that [an employer] had discriminatory motivation and intent . . . [is] inadequate, without substantial factual evidence, to raise . . . a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext in order to avoid summary judgment." Collings v. Longview Fibre Co., 63 F.3d 828, 834 (9th Cir. 1995). Furthermore, "[w]here evidence of pretext is circumstantial, rather than direct, the plaintiff must produce 'specific' . . . facts to create a triable issue of pretext." Earl, 658 F.3d at 1113 (internal citation omitted).

i. Age Discrimination
1. Direct Discrimination
Pineda contends that no burden-shifting analysis is necessary because there is direct evidence of age discrimination. Pineda argues that the "matter here has a plethora of comments, which even standing alone would be sufficient." Dkt. 121, Ex. A, at 13-14. In the context of age discrimination, Pineda is likely referring to Arnold's comment that younger employees had a "long runway" while older employees had a "short runway." Although this comment referred to age, it [*19]  is not direct evidence of age discrimination because it does not prove the fact of discriminatory animus without inference or presumption.14 Thus, there is no direct evidence of age discrimination.
2. Burden-Shifting Analysis
a. Prima Facie Case
To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), a plaintiff generally must show that: "(1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he . . . was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, . . . and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355.
Abbott argues that Pineda does not establish a prima facie case of age discrimination because there is no evidence of discriminatory motive. Abbott is correct.
Pineda presents no evidence of actions taken by Abbott from which "one can infer . . . that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a [prohibited] discriminatory criterion." Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Pineda admits that he had good working relationships with his supervisors, and Pineda does not allege that any Abbott representative made any negative comments [*20]  to Pineda about his age. Rather, Pineda relies on Arnold's "runway" comment as well as Tanner's characterizations of Pineda's behavior as "clunky," "confused," and "mechanical." Dkt. 121, Ex. A, at 16-17. With respect to the "runway" comment, Pineda provides no evidence or argument that the statement is discriminatory. Pineda himself alleges that Arnold conveyed to Pineda that these expressions were used to refer to the amount of time or number of years left in an employee's career in terms of their capacity to be promoted. That younger employees have more working years in which they may be promoted is indisputably factual. Furthermore, there is no indication that Arnold was referencing Pineda's age or Pineda's capacity for promotion.
As to Tanner's characterizations of Pineda's work, Pineda provides no evidence or argument that they were related to his age. Anyone—younger or older—can be clunky, confused, or mechanical. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit has held that referring to an employee as an "old timer" was "ambiguous" and was "not enough to support an inference of age discrimination." Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 113 F.3d 912, 918-19 (9th Cir. 1996). The statements here—including the "runway" comment—are much less direct and inflammatory than [*21]  that. Thus, Pineda cannot establish the element of discriminatory motive. Pineda's failure to establish this element is sufficient to grant summary judgment on his age discrimination claim.
b. Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Rationale
Even if Pineda had established a prima facie case of age discrimination, Abbott could shift the burden back to Pineda by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory rationale for terminating Pineda's employment. Pineda's performance reviews from 2014 through his termination in 2017 demonstrate a declining level of performance, and negative performance reviews can contribute to a finding of incompetent performance. See Sneddon v. ABF Freight Sys., 489 F. Supp. 2d 1124, 1130 (2007). In addition, some of Pineda's colleagues sent complaints to Pineda's superiors regarding Pineda's performance. In this regard the undisputed facts are similar to those in Sneddon, where a court held that "progressively worsening" performance reviews over a three-year period in combination with emails that set forth the plaintiff's "errors, problems, and inadequate attention to detail" were sufficient to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory rationale to terminate the plaintiff's employment. Id. at 1130. Similarly, here Pineda's well-documented [*22]  performance record provides a non-discriminatory rationale for the termination of his employment.15
c. Pretext
Pineda makes several arguments as to why Abbott's termination of Pineda's employment was merely pretextual. First, Pineda speculates that he was treated differently than other employees, but he cites no evidence regarding a more favorably treated employee.16 See Boyd v. AutoZone, Inc., No. C 11-00776 JSW, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138552, 2012 WL 4466538, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2012) (granting summary judgment where employee had not presented evidence "that similarly situated individuals outside his protected class were treated more favorably").
Second, Pineda argues that Abbott deviated from company policies, including by failing to investigate a complaint made by Pineda in July 2015. However, even if true, Abbott's failure to investigate a complaint in 2015 hardly serves as evidence of pretext when Abbott conducted multiple investigations in 2016 and 2017. Furthermore, an investigatory defect does not undermine Abbott's stated legitimate reason for terminating Pineda's employment.
Third, Pineda claims that Abbott ignored Pineda's positive performance. However, Pineda's proffered evidence does not dispute the fact that all three of Pineda's supervisors from 2015 to [*23]  2017 concluded that he did not meet expectations in many core competencies, and that others complained about his poor performance. In other words, in light of Pineda's overall performance record, Pineda's evidence is not substantial. To the extent Pineda attempts to rely on his own positive impressions of his performance, "an employee's subjective personal judgments of [his] competence alone do not raise a genuine issue of material fact." Bradley v. Harcourt, Brace & Co., 104 F.3d 267, 270 (9th Cir. 1996). Furthermore, at times (although not always) Pineda's self-assessments corroborated his supervisors' criticisms.
Fourth, Pineda points to the evidence of allegedly biased comments made by Abbott representatives, such as the "runway" comment. However, this argument fails for the reasons discussed above regarding the prima facie case. In addition, isolated and "stray" remarks are "insufficient to establish discrimination," Merrick v. Farmers Ins. Grp., 892 F.2d 1434, 1438 (9th Cir. 1990) (internal citation omitted), and here there is no evidence that any other similar comment was ever made to Pineda.
Lastly, Pineda presents "me, too" evidence of other former Abbott employees who allege that they were discriminated against on account of their age. Dkt. 118, Exs. 3-7. However, in only two of these cases were the "me, [*24]  too" employees supervised by any of the same people that supervised Pineda. See Schrand v. Fed. Pac. Elec. Co., 851 F.2d 152, 156 (6th Cir. 1988) (holding that evidence of discrimination against one other employee was insufficient); see also Machado v. Johnson, 191 Fed. App'x 531, 533 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that discriminatory conduct by an individual who was not involved in the decision to terminate plaintiff was not relevant to plaintiff's claim); cf. Johnson v. U. Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children's Found. of Los Angeles, 173 Cal. App. 4th 740, 759, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 198 (2009) (holding that "me too" evidence of discrimination was substantial evidence of pretext where the other wronged employees "worked at the same facility where plaintiff worked, [and] they were supervised by the same people that supervised plaintiff"). On this record, the "me, too" allegations do not constitute substantial factual evidence of pretext.
3. Summary
In sum, Pineda's age discrimination claim fails as a matter of law because there is no direct evidence of age discrimination, because Pineda fails to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination and, alternatively, because Pineda does not present substantial factual evidence of pretext.

ii. Disability Discrimination
1. Direct Discrimination
Pineda contends that no burden-shifting analysis is necessary because there is direct evidence of disability discrimination. Pineda argues that the "matter here [*25]  has a plethora of comments, which even standing alone would be sufficient." Dkt. 121, Ex. A, at 13-14. In the context of disability discrimination, Pineda is likely referring to Weiss's comment about Pineda's "sighing" as well as Tanner's characterization of Pineda as being "clunky," "mechanical," apprehensive," "anxious," and "confused," and that he had "fail[ed] to recognize" things and was "unable to adapt." None of these comments or characterizations is direct evidence of disability discrimination because none proves the fact of discriminatory animus without inference or presumption.
2. Burden-Shifting Analysis
a. Prima Facie Case
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show: "(1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and, (3) he was subjected to [an] adverse employment action because of his disability." Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 886, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007).
Pineda cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. In particular, Pineda cannot show that he was subjected to an adverse employment action "because of his disability."17 Pineda bears the burden to establish a causal relationship between his protected status18 and the termination [*26]  of his employment.
Pineda argues that Abbott representatives made comments that alluded to Pineda's disability, such as characterizations that he was "mechanical," "clunky," "apprehensive," "anxious," and "confused." The other contested statement is about Pineda's "sighing." However, none of these comments—with the possible exception of the reference to Pineda's being "anxious"—necessarily has anything to do with any of Pineda's claimed disabilities. They could be—indeed are more likely than not to be—related to Pineda's competence with respect to performing the functions of his job, which included collaborating with customers (and of particular import, working with executives).19 As to the alleged statement about Pineda's anxiety, Pineda offers no evidence that his employment was terminated because of his anxiety. Given the vast array of substantive complaints regarding Plaintiff's performance by the time his employment was terminated, such an allegation is pure speculation.
b. Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Rationale
Even if Pineda had established a prima facie case of disability discrimination, Abbott could shift the burden [*27]  back to Pineda by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory rationale for terminating Pineda's employment. As discussed above, Abbott's legitimate, non-discriminatory rationale for terminating Pineda's employment is Pineda's inadequate performance record from 2015 to 2017.
c. Pretext
Pineda's arguments regarding pretext generally track those discussed and rejected above in the context of age discrimination. Furthermore, the sequence of events fatally undermines Pineda's case. The earliest that Pineda can be said to have disclosed a disability was February 2016, when he went on his first medical leave. Yet, Pineda's substandard performance, on which termination was ultimately based, started in 2014. By February 2016, Pineda had already received multiple subpar performance reviews from three different supervisors and Tanner had issued the performance management memorandum. Thus, Pineda received negative performance feedback well before any disability. To suggest that Pineda's supervisors conceived of a plan in 2014 to give him negative performance feedback as a pretext to fire him three years later for a disability that would not arise until 2016 is pure speculation.
3. Summary
In sum, [*28]  Pineda's disability discrimination claim fails as a matter of law because there is no direct evidence of disability discrimination, because Pineda fails to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination and, alternatively, because Pineda does not present substantial factual evidence of pretext.

2. Retaliation
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show "(1) he or she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Meeks v. Autozone, Inc., 24 Cal. App. 5th 855, 878-79, 235 Cal. Rptr. 3d 161 (2018) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
Abbott argues that there is no causal connection between any protected activity and the adverse employment actions. Indeed, Pineda's performance deficiencies began in 2014—over a year before any protected activity.
Pineda attempts to rebut this argument by alleging that Pineda made one final complaint on February 14, 2017—only nine days before Pineda's employment was terminated. See Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hosp., 214 Cal. App. 3d 590, 615, 262 Cal. Rptr. 842 (1989) ("The causal link may be established by an inference derived from circumstantial evidence, such as the employer's knowledge that the [employee] engaged [*29]  in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected action and allegedly retaliatory employment decision.") (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). However, according to the undisputed record evidence, Abbott initiated the termination process on February 13—the day before the complaint that Pineda relies on to establish retaliation. See Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 272, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) (holding that evidence that an employer planned to transfer an employee before her claimed protected activity dispelled any inference that the transfer was retaliatory). This sequence of events and the fact that Pineda's performance deficiencies pre-date Pineda's protected activity are fatal to Pineda's prima facie claim for retaliation.20
Furthermore, although Pineda could conceivably argue that termination of his employment was in retaliation for one of his earlier complaints (such as those on July 31, 2015, March 1, 2016, and September 5, 2016), such an argument would be purely speculative. See Cornwell v. Electra Cent. Credit Union, 439 F.3d 1018, 1036 (9th Cir. 2006) (affirming summary judgment for employer on employee's retaliation claim because seven months had elapsed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action). In fact, rather than terminating his employment after receiving [*30]  such complaints, Abbott conducted investigations and permitted him to take medical leave.

3. Harassment
The FEHA makes it unlawful for an "employer . . . because of . . . physical [or . . .] mental disability [or . . .] medical condition [or . . .] age . . . to harass an employee . . . ." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(j)(1). To establish a prima facie case of harassment based on a "hostile work environment" for the purpose of avoiding summary judgment, Pineda must prove that "(1) []he was subjected to verbal or physical conduct because of" his age or disability, "(2) the conduct was unwelcome, and (3) the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [Pineda's] employment and create an abusive working environment." Juell v. Forest Pharm., Inc., 456 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1157 (E.D. Cal. 2006) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The acts of harassment "cannot be occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial[;] rather the plaintiff must show a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated, routine or a generalized nature." Fisher, 214 Cal. App. 3d at 610. Furthermore, "[u]nlike discrimination claims, harassment 'consists of actions outside the scope of job duties which are not of a type necessary to business and personnel management.'" Lawler v. Montblanc N. Am, LLC, 704 F.3d 1235, 1244 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal. 4th 640, 647, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333 (1998)).
Pineda's harassment claim necessarily fails as [*31]  a matter of law. Pineda's harassment allegations include comments made to Pineda regarding his performance as well as the decision to terminate Pineda's employment. These allegations involve business and personnel management decisions and thus cannot constitute a cognizable harassment claim.21 The most significant allegation regarding harassment is that Tanner berated Pineda on a conference call in 2016. However, this too involved actions within the scope of Pineda's job duties and thus cannot support a harassment claim. In sum, Pineda does not offer evidence of a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated nature based on actions that are outside the scope of business and personnel management actions.22

4. Summary
For the reasons discussed above, Abbott is entitled to summary judgment that it did not violate the FEHA by discriminating against, retaliating against, or harassing Pineda.23 Thus, the Court GRANTS Abbott's motion for summary judgment on this claim.

B. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process (Claim 2)
The Ninth Circuit has held that "once an employee requests an accommodation . . . the employer must engage in an interactive process with the employee to [*32]  determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation." Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc), vacated on other grounds, U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391 (2002)). The interactive process "requires: (1) direct communication between the employer and employee to explore in good faith the possible accommodations; (2) consideration of the employee's request; and (3) offering an accommodation that is reasonable and effective." Id. Crucially, a plaintiff must prove that the "employer bears responsibility for [a] breakdown in the interactive process." Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
Pineda does not provide evidence—or even allege—that there was a "breakdown" in the interactive process. Rather, it is undisputed that on November 17, 2016, Tanner and an ER employee had a conversation with Pineda to discuss Pineda's accommodation requests. Furthermore, on November 20, 2016, Pineda emailed Tanner and the ER employee to state that he would comply with Abbott's requirement that he ramp up to working full-time by December 1, 2016 and to thank Abbott for accepting all of the other accommodations requested by his doctors in the manner they had agreed to in their prior conversation. On this record, no reasonable jury could find that there was [*33]  a breakdown in the interactive process (much less that Abbott caused a breakdown in the interactive process). Thus, the Court GRANTS Abbott's motion for summary judgment on this claim.24

C. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation (Claim 3)
Under the FEHA, employers have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations for employees' known physical or mental disabilities. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(1). "The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). The "burden of proving the availability of a reasonable accommodation rests on the employee." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008).
Although Pineda took two medical leaves and requested work restrictions on both occasions, only the second return from leave is contested.25 The relevant facts are these: Pineda forwarded to Abbott a letter from his physician dated November 8, 2016, which stated that Pineda would need four temporary accommodations: (1) four-hour workdays through December 31, 2016; (2) additional time to catch up to training programs/meetings; (3) have large assignments divided [*34]  into smaller tasks and steps; and (4) have Abbott develop strategies to deal with problems before they arose. On November 17, 2016, Tanner and an ER employee had a conversation with Pineda to discuss Pineda's accommodation requests. On November 20, 2016, Pineda emailed Tanner and the ER employee to state that he would comply with Abbott's requirement that he ramp up to working full-time by December 1, 2016 and to thank Abbott for accepting all of the other accommodations requested by his doctors in the manner they had agreed to in their prior conversation. Then, in early December, Pineda submitted a new letter from his physician, which stated that she was releasing Pineda to return to working eight hours per day with no restrictions on December 1, 2016. Pineda later testified that he did not disagree with what his physician wrote in that letter.
On this record, no reasonable jury could find that Abbott failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. First, Pineda's follow-up email on November 20, 2016—which thanked Abbott—indicated that the parties had come to an agreement regarding accommodations that Pineda found agreeable. For Pineda now to argue, two years later, that he did not mean [*35]  what he wrote and that the accommodations were in fact unreasonable is entirely unpersuasive. Second, Pineda's physician ultimately concluded that Pineda did not need any accommodation, because she cleared him to return to work full-time with no restrictions. Given that Pineda did not need any accommodation, Abbott cannot be found to have failed to provide a reasonable accommodation.26 For these reasons, the Court GRANTS Abbott's motion for summary judgment on this claim.

D. Retaliation for Taking CFRA Leave (Claim 4)
This claim alleges that Abbott retaliated against Pineda for requesting and/or taking leave under the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"). "A plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of the CFRA by showing the following: (1) the defendant was a covered employer; (2) the plaintiff was eligible for CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised his or her right to take a qualifying leave; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because he or she exercised the right to take CFRA leave." Rogers v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 198 Cal. App. 4th 480, 491, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 350 (2011) (emphasis in original).
In Neisendorf v. Levi Strauss & Co., 143 Cal. App. 4th 509, 520, 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 216 (2006), the employer terminated the plaintiff's employment the day she returned from CFRA leave, and yet the Court [*36]  of Appeal affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the CFRA retaliation claim because the employer's legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for firing plaintiff "had nothing to do with her CFRA leave." The employer in Neisendorf offered evidence "showing that [the plaintiff's] employment was terminated when she received an unsatisfactory performance evaluation . . . and refused to accept or address the performance deficiencies set forth in the evaluation." Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The same holds true here; Abbott's reason for terminating Pineda's employment—his years of substandard performance—had nothing to do with Pineda's CFRA leave. Furthermore, Abbott permitted Pineda to return to work after each of his medical leave periods. Thus, the Court GRANTS Abbott's motion for summary judgment on this claim.27

E. Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation (Claim 5)
This is a derivative claim. Because "there is no basis for the underlying discrimination and retaliation claims, the . . . failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation [claims] must also fail." Leatherbury v. C & H Sugar Co., Inc., 911 F. Supp. 2d 872, 883 (N.D. Cal. 2012); see also Marshall v. Labs., No. SACV 13-01867 JVS (JEMx), 2014 WL 12571422, at *14 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 19, 2014) (holding [*37]  that failure to prevent harassment is also a derivative claim). Thus, the Court GRANTS Abbott's motion for summary judgment on this claim.

F. Wrongful Termination of Employment (Claim 6)
This is a derivative claim. Because Pineda's "FEHA claim fails, his claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy fails." Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 229, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). Thus, the Court GRANTS Abbott's motion for summary judgment on this claim.

G. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (Claim 7)
As this Court explained in its September 27, 2018 order, Dkt. 53, personnel management actions cannot support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, regardless of any improper motivation. Janken v. GM Hughes Elecs., 46 Cal. App. 4th 55, 80, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996) (holding that a "simple pleading of personnel management activity is insufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, even if improper motivation is alleged"). Here, Pineda's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is based on the same conduct as his FEHA claims, which the Court holds, above, to constitute personnel management activity. Thus, the Court GRANTS Abbott's motion for summary judgment on this claim.

V. Conclusion
For the above reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motion for summary [*38]  judgment as to Claims 1-7.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
