Opinion



ORDER
This matter is before the Court on the Magistrate Judge's Final Report and Recommendation ("R & R") [Doc. 71], which recommends that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgement [Doc. 47] be GRANTED. Plaintiff Tamara Mays has filed an objection to the R & R [Doc. 75], claiming the R&R is contrary to law and that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgement should have been denied. Defendant Dekalb County, Georgia (the "County") has filed a response to Plaintiff's Objections. [Doc. 76].

I. LEGAL STANDARD
In reviewing a magistrate's report and recommendation, the district court "shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made." 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). "Parties filing objections to a magistrate's report and recommendation must specifically identify those findings [*2]  objected to. Frivolous, conclusive, or general objections need not be considered by the district court." United States v. Schultz, 565 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Marsden v. Moore, 847 F.2d 1536, 1548 (11th Cir. 1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Plaintiff has raised objections which the Court has reviewed on a de novo basis, as discussed fully below.
The Court may grant summary judgment only if the record shows "that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A factual dispute is genuine if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict in favor of the non-moving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A factual dispute is material if resolving the factual issue might change the suit's outcome under the governing law. Id. The motion should be granted only if no rational fact finder could return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party. Id. at 249.
When ruling on the motion, the Court must view all the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and resolve all factual disputes in the non-moving party's favor. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). The moving party need not positively disprove the opponent's case; rather, the moving party must establish the lack of evidentiary support for the non-moving party's [*3]  position. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the moving party meets this initial burden, to survive summary judgment, the non-moving party must then present competent evidence beyond the pleadings to show that there is a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 324-26. The essential question is "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52.

II. BACKGROUND
In the R&R, the Magistrate Court has provided a detailed narrative of the undisputed material facts. [Doc. 71 at 4-19]. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3), the Court has also conducted its own review of the record, and it appearing that the parties do not dispute the Magistrates Court's finding of facts, the Court adopts and restates the facts as provided in the Magistrate Court's Final Report and Recommendation. Id. (citations omitted).
Plaintiff Tamara Mays began working for the County in January 2008 as a generalist in the human resources department. In January 2011, Benita Ransom became the director of human resources for the County and served as Plaintiff's second-level supervisor for approximately eighteen months.
In or around August 2012, the County posted for a position entitled [*4]  HR Manager-Organization & Employee Development ("OED"). Ransom encouraged Plaintiff to apply for the job. Plaintiff had reservations about her qualifications for the position, but was assured by Ransom that she would receive training and help to be successful at the position. The offer letter stated that Plaintiff was to attain SHRM certification—which would require her to take and pass a certification examination—within one year of her promotion. Plaintiff accepted the position, signed the offer letter, and started as a human resources manager in August 2012.
Initially, Plaintiff and Ransom had a good working relationship. Despite the offer letter, Plaintiff felt that the SHRM certification was not a priority and neither was it a topic of conversation. Ransom engaged a trainer for Plaintiff, and Plaintiff and the trainer met for several weeks.
In or around summer 2014, Plaintiff's home responsibilities increased and she was not able to stay at work as late as she had in the past. Around this time, Ransom began criticizing Plaintiff and her work. Plaintiff's demeanor began to change—she was no longer her "bubbly self"; she would sit in her office with the lights off, which she had never [*5]  done before; she had crying spells; and she began having panic attacks at the office. After an encounter with Ransom left Plaintiff hiding in her car in tears, a coworker encouraged Plaintiff to seek medical attention.
Plaintiff began seeing a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety/social anxiety disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ("ADHD") in late April 2015. Plaintiff requested and took sick leave once a month to see her psychiatrist. The medication Plaintiff's psychiatrist prescribed made her feel panicked and overwhelmed.
Between May and June 2015, Plaintiff and Ransom communicated about Plaintiff's progress in the human-resources-manager role, and Ransom expressed dissatisfaction with Plaintiff's ability to master the skills necessary to perform as a manager. Ransom also asked Plaintiff to advise her in writing of her plan to attain SHRM certification. Plaintiff responded that she understood "the expectation that was set and still remains." Plaintiff registered for and took the SHRM examination in June 2015. She did not pass. Ransom sent an email to Plaintiff in June 2015 directing her to sit for the certification examination again [*6]  during the December 2015/January 2016 testing cycle.
In October 2015, Plaintiff asked the human resources department to pay for her to attend a three-day training offered by the Association for Talent Development ("ATD"). Ransom initially said yes to the ATD training, but about thirty minutes later she said that it had dawned on her that Plaintiff had not attained SHRM certification. Therefore, she did not want to pay for the training.
In a follow-up memorandum dated November 2, 2015, Ransom wrote that she was delaying consideration of Plaintiff's request to attend ATD training until Plaintiff had taken and passed the SHRM examination. Ransom also noted that the human resources department had already spent $6,000 on a professional coach and paid for Plaintiff to attend SHRM certification training. Ransom stated that there had been "no return on HR's investment in [Plaintiff's] career development" and, therefore, "[f]urther expenditure of funds for [Plaintiff's] training, at this juncture, is neither reasonable nor fair to other HR professionals who dedicated their time and effort to successfully acquire certification." Ransom additionally stated in the memo that she wanted Plaintiff [*7]  "to devote the next three months preparing for the upcoming SHRM examination cycle," and Ransom indicated that they could resume discussion of ATD training and Plaintiff's continued professional development in February 2016 after the winter testing cycle.
In a meeting taking place the same day, Plaintiff informed Ransom of her Diagnoses, and described how her conditions and medications were affecting her work. Plaintiff told Ransom that she had ADHD, anxiety, and severe depression; that she was being medicated for each condition; and that frequent changes in her medication were causing "ups and downs" and behavior changes that were taking a toll on her. Plaintiff also orally requested that Ransom put her directives to her in writing because Plaintiff's conditions were causing her to confuse Ransom's directives and Plaintiff needed "a reference point to make sure [she] was clear on what [Ransom] was asking." Plaintiff also told Ransom that the accommodation request would be covered under the ADA. Ransom responded, "Well, now I wonder if you're even fit to work." Ransom put off having any further meetings about an accommodation and Plaintiff's acquisition of the certification.
Plaintiff [*8]  responded to Ransom's November 2, 2015, memorandum with her own memorandum, dated November 8, 2015. In the memo, Plaintiff stated that it "was and is my understanding that I will not be able to participate in any development opportunities until I pass the SHRM Certification by a deadline of January 2016." She also argued that it was unfair for Ransom to deny her funding for training opportunities until she passed the SHRM certification; stated that the pressure Ransom put on her was causing her stress and anxiety; and opined that because of the stress and her impairments, she might not ever be able to pass the SHRM examination. Plaintiff also complained to Ransom's supervisor, chief operating officer Zachary Williams, and to Williams's administrative assistant, Claudette Leak, that Ransom was ignoring her request for a reasonable accommodation.
On December 1, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a complaint on Ethics Point, a complaint-investigation system the County had at the time. In the complaint, Plaintiff complained of, among other things, pay and budget issues, Ransom's management style, and that Ransom "put an immense amount of pressure on [Plaintiff] to take and pass the PHR/SPHR." Plaintiff [*9]  complained that the pressure Ransom placed on her caused Plaintiff "great anxiety"; and stated that "[d]ue to the progression of these[] issues [she] ha[d] even visited the COO's office to discuss, during which time [she] revealed the onset of medical conditions that have resulted due to stress and overwhelming pressure."
On December 8, 2015, Plaintiff added to the Ethics Point complaint, stating, in part, that she had again told Ransom that Plaintiff "had an onset of health issues for which [she] take[s] medication . . . due to the stress, anxiety and other issues." Plaintiff also noted that despite meeting her metrics, accomplishing goals set out in the business plan, and performing the duties of her job description, she was still unclear what Ransom expected of her; so, Plaintiff again requested that Ransom issue her directives in writing. Plaintiff also added that she had a conversation with Ransom that day, wherein Plaintiff stated that she was "asking for reasonable accommodations due to [her] issues which are covered by ADA"; and that Plaintiff's negative interactions with Ransom led to her stress-related diagnoses and elevated blood pressure.
On January 6, 2016, Ransom emailed [*10]  Plaintiff to ask about the status of her SHRM certification. The following day, Plaintiff responded that she had not passed the June 2015 examination; had not registered to take the test for the 2015/2016 testing cycle; was not in a financial position to register for the test; and because her medical issues would affect Plaintiff's ability to take and pass the certification examination, that Plaintiff was looking into alternative testing options.
Plaintiff also met with Williams in January 2016 and outlined her diagnoses. Plaintiff told Williams that she had been seeing a psychiatrist, and told him about the effects the conditions and her medications were having on her. Plaintiff also told Williams that her psychiatrist had recently recommended that she take medical leave. In response, Williams said, "Okay. You know, whatever your doctor recommends, that's what you need to do."
On January 8, 2016, Plaintiff submitted to Elizabeth Fluellen, Ransom's assistant, a request form asking to take leave coded as "Training/Conference Pay" from Wednesday, January 27, 2016, through Friday, January 29, 2016. Later that day, Fluellen returned Plaintiff's leave-request slip to her and told her that [*11]  Ransom requested additional information about the purpose of the training and how the training related to her professional development. Plaintiff then asked Roy Wilson, the head of the County's Parks and Recreation Department, to pay for her to attend ATD training. Wilson agreed to pay for the training.
On January 14, 2016, Plaintiff met with Leak and told Leak that Plaintiff's doctor had recommended Plaintiff go on medical leave immediately. Plaintiff mentioned the ATD training to Leak and told Leak that the Parks and Recreation Department had already paid for Plaintiff to attend. Leak told Plaintiff that since the County had already paid for the ATD training, Plaintiff "might as well go."
On January 19, 2016, Plaintiff sent an email to Ransom in response to the request for further information about Plaintiff's training-leave request. In the email, Plaintiff stated that the leave was for ATD training, provided information about the ATD training, and argued that the training would assist in her professional development.
Plaintiff also followed up with Ransom the next day in person regarding her request for training leave. During the meeting, Ransom told Plaintiff that she lacked initiative [*12]  and that Ransom received less return on investment from Plaintiff than from any of Ransom's other managers. In response, Plaintiff reiterated her diagnoses of ADHD, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and high blood pressure; told Ransom that her symptoms were becoming worse; told Ransom that her doctor "recommended or insisted" that she take FMLA leave; and told Ransom that she would be taking FMLA leave. Plaintiff then resubmitted her training-leave request to Fluellen with the information Fluellen had requested on Ransom's behalf.
On January 21, 2016, Ransom issued Plaintiff a memorandum entitled "Intent to Return to Former Classification" for "failure to meet the requirement of your provisional promotion" and "insubordination or willful failure to carry out an official supervisory directive or job assignment." The memo indicated that Plaintiff was issued the "Intent to Return to Former Classification" primarily due to Plaintiff's failure to complete the SHRM certification. Ransom also explained in the memo that it was a "blatant disregard of [her] directives" and "clear insubordination" for Plaintiff to have 1) solicited another department to pay for the ATD training that Ransom [*13]  had directed Plaintiff to delay until completion of the SHRM certification and 2) for Plaintiff to have planned to take work time to attend the training without Ransom's knowledge and approval. The memo stated that the demotion would be effective January 27, 2016.
On January 25, 2016, two days before the ATD training, Plaintiff contacted Leak to discuss her personnel issues. The same day, Plaintiff submitted a DeKalb County government complaint form. On the form, she checked boxes indicating that her complaint was based on disability discrimination and retaliation. Plaintiff also wrote, in part, "I notified [Ransom] of some health issues that I have experienced due to the stress she put me under. Additionally, I disclosed that I have medical issues that have the potential to not allow me to ever pass the certification exam. I also disclosed that I am seeking professional medical attention for my issues and mental impairment for which I am [taking] medication."
On January 26, 2016, Plaintiff told her doctor that she intended to begin taking medical leave starting on January 27, 2016, but that she had training to attend. Plaintiff's doctor agreed that she could attend the ATD training [*14]  since the training would be away from the County, and Ransom and no one else from the County was involved or participating in the training.
Plaintiff then hand-delivered paperwork requesting FMLA leave to Angela Hosten, the County's senior human resources specialist who served as the County's FMLA administrator and was responsible for approving FMLA for the entire county. In the paperwork, Plaintiff requested that the leave begin on January 27, 2016. Although the FMLA form stated that a Certification of Health Care Form must be completed and attached, Plaintiff did not include a certification from her doctor.
Plaintiff also responded to Ransom's January 21 memorandum by her own memorandum dated January 26, 2017. In her response memorandum, Plaintiff recounted that she had told Ransom in early November that she had been unable to pass the SHRM examination due to an onset of medical issues and that Ransom had replied, "that's fine." The January 26th memorandum did not, however, mention the FMLA, the ADA, or any of Plaintiff's diagnoses.
On the morning of January 27, 2016, Plaintiff sent a group text message to individuals in her department stating that she would be out of the office for [*15]  training the rest of the week. Plaintiff did not include Ransom in the group text message. Later that day, Ransom issued a memorandum to Plaintiff entitled "Intent to Terminate," in which she stated that Plaintiff was in violation of DeKalb County Code, Chapter 20, Article IX, Section 20-911, paragraphs (8), for failure to call in when sick or absent from work otherwise without prior approval, (22) for insubordination or willful failure to carry out an official supervisory directive nor job assignment, and (34) for failure to report to work without prior approval, except when sick leave is authorized. Ransom further stated in the memorandum,
In a memo dated November 2, 2015, I denied your request to attend a 3-day training offered by Association for Talent Development (ATD) until after you take and pass the SHRM certification exam by the end of January 2016. . . .Your formal leave request for training time (January 27-29) was also not approved.
In spite of my directive, you went to another department head to obtain funding for the training. On January 27, 2016 you did not report to work nor did you advise me of your absence, as you know is required of all managers. I learned later in the day you are attending ATD training [*16]  today and for the remainder of the week . . . .
Your decision to ignore my directives and the blatant disregard for department head authority create an irreconcilable situation. The gravity and seriousness of your actions leave no alternative but to terminate your employment.
Plaintiff attended the ATD training on January 27, 2016; attended about half a day of the training on January 28, 2016; and received a certificate of completion from ATD. Plaintiff never reported to work after January 26 and intended to come back only after the end of her requested medical leave.
On February 2, 2016, the counselor Plaintiff was seeing at Kaiser Permanente faxed Hosten a certification of serious health condition. In the certification, the counselor reported that Plaintiff had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, that stress increased Plaintiff's blood pressure, and that Plaintiff's symptoms included decreased sleep, appetite, and enjoyment in life, increased irritability, depressed mood, and passive suicidal thoughts; stated that the condition had commenced on approximately January 27, 2016; opined that Plaintiff's depressive symptoms would preclude her from performing her job duties for [*17]  approximately six weeks; and stated that upon Plaintiff's return to work, Plaintiff would need to work no more than two eight-hour workdays weekly for the next year.
The County terminated Plaintiff on February 10, 2016, for failure to call in when sick or absent from work otherwise without prior approval; insubordination or willful failure to carry out an official supervisory directive or job assignment; and failure to report to work without prior approval, except when sick leave is authorized.
Plaintiff appealed the demotion and termination decisions at a merit-system appeal hearing on March 9, 2016, and the decisions were upheld. On April 26, 2016, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. On July 18, 2017, the EEOC issued a notice of right to sue.
Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff as the non-moving party, the Court, addressing each of the Plaintiff's Objections in turn, enters the following Order.

III. DISCUSSION

A. FMLA CLAIMS

1. FMLA Interference
Under the FMLA, an eligible employee is entitled to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable [*18]  to perform the functions of his position, among other reasons. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). The FMLA makes it "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). To protect an eligible employee's FMLA rights, the FMLA establishes causes of action for interference claims, "in which an employee asserts that [her] employer denied or otherwise interfered with [her] substantive rights under the Act," and retaliation claims, "in which an employee asserts that [her] employer discriminated against [her] because she engaged in activity protected by the Act." Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing 29 U.S.C. §2615(a)); accord Smith v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 273 F.3d 1303, 1313 (11th Cir. 2001) To prevail on a claim of FMLA interference, an employee must show, by preponderance of the evidence, that she was denied a benefit to which she was entitled under the FMLA and that she has been prejudiced by the violation in some way. Evans v. Books-A-Million, 762 F.3d 1288, 1295 (11th Cir. 2014). The employee need not show that the employer intended to deny the benefit or had discriminatory intent. Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir. 2010); Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1208 (11th Cir. 2001).
Plaintiff objects to the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient notice of her intent to take FMLA leave. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that her need for leave was unforeseeable, [*19]  and consequently, she was only required to "provide sufficient information for [the County] to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request," claiming the County then had the burden of obtaining additional information. [Doc. 75 at 12-13].
To state a claim of FMLA interference, the employee must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that she was entitled to a benefit that she was denied. Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207. There is no causal-nexus element in an interference claim; the employer's motives are irrelevant. Spakes v. Broward Cnty. Sheriff's Office, 631 F.3d 1307, 1309-10 (11th Cir. 2011). Nevertheless, the employer may allege a lack of causation or a lawful reason for termination as an affirmative defense to liability. Rudy v. Walter Coke, Inc., 613 Fed. Appx. 828, 830 (11th Cir. June 2, 2015) ("If the evidence shows that a decisionmaker was unaware of an employee's request to take FMLA leave at the time of the decision to terminate the employee, the employer is entitled to summary judgment.") (citing Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236,1242 (11th Cir. 2010)); Spakes, 631 F.3d at 1310 ("If an employer demonstrates that it would have discharged an employee 'for a reason wholly unrelated to the FMLA leave, the employer is not liable' under the FMLA for damages for failure to reinstate.") (quoting Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208); Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir. 2010) (holding that "the right to commence FMLA leave is not absolute, and that an employee can be dismissed, preventing [*20]  her from exercising her right to commence FMLA leave, without thereby violating the FMLA, if the employee would have been dismissed regardless of any request for FMLA leave," and thus, that "the unrebutted evidence that the decision maker was not aware, at the time of the decision to terminate [the plaintiff], of her request to commence FMLA leave establishes as a matter of law that [her] termination was for reasons other than her requested leave").
A claim asserted under the FMLA cannot succeed, however, "'unless the plaintiff can show that he gave his employer adequate and timely notice of his need for leave'" Berry v. Lewis Trucking & Grading, Civ. Action File No. 1:06-CV-0041-JEC/AJB, 2007 WL 9701930, at *13 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 23, 2007) (Baverman, M.J.) (quoting Woods v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 409 F.3d 984, 991 (8th Cir. 2005)), adopted at ECF No. 59 (May 29, 2007) (Carnes, J.); accord White, 789 F.3d at 1195 ("An employee's notice of her need for FMLA leave must satisfy two criteria—timing and content"). For the content of the notice to be deemed adequate, it must include the reason for the leave, the anticipated timing of the leave, and the duration of the leave. 29 C.F.R. § 825.301(b); Cruz, 428 F.3d at 1383; see also Sparks v. Sunshine Mills, Inc., 580 Fed. Appx. 759, 766 (11th Cir. Sept. 12, 2014) (holding that employee failed to provide notice sufficient to make employer aware that employee needed FMLA leave for surgery, as required to support [*21]  employee's claim that employer interfered with his FMLA rights by terminating him before he could take FMLA leave, where an employee merely informed supervisors that "it was looking like it was very possible" that he was going to have surgery. The Employee failed to request leave or provide any information as to timing or duration of any leave); cf. Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Cmties., Inc., 666 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2012) (finding advance request for maternity leave sufficiently definite to render the employee eligible for protection under the FMLA).
Plaintiff asserts that she gave sufficient notice because her serious health condition necessitated unforeseeable FMLA leave and unforeseeable leave only requires notice "as soon as is practicable." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(e)(2); 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.302(a), 825.303(a); White, 789 F.3d at 1195-96; Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208. The regulations state that "as soon as practicable means as soon as both possible and practical, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances in the individual case." 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(b).
The Magistrate Court concluded that Plaintiff's leave was foreseeable, and the Court agrees, however, out of an abundance of caution, that the Magistrate Court addressed whether Plaintiff's notice was "practical" if her leave was considered unforeseeable. This Court will do the same.
"An employee's notice of her need for FMLA leave [*22]  must satisfy two criteria-timing and content." White v. Beltran Edge Tool Supply, Inc., 789 F.3d 1188, 1195 (11th Cir. 2015). Plaintiff argues that, "[w]hen the need for leave is unforeseeable, the employee need only 'provide sufficient information for an employer to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request.' 29 CFR § 825.303(b)." [Doc. 75 at 11]. However, as the Magistrate Court noted, even if Plaintiff's need for FMLA leave was unforeseeable, she failed to meet the FMLA requirement of providing notice as soon as possible or practical. The record shows that due to her medical condition, Plaintiff's doctor recommended immediate FMLA leave as early as January 14, 2016. The undisputed record also shows that Plaintiff requested leave a week later, not for FMLA purposes, but for ATD training. There is no indication on the record that Plaintiff's condition worsened between the dates of January 14, 2016 and January 26, 2016; thus, as the Magistrate Court determined, "there appears to be no basis in Plaintiff's filings for a determination that January 26, 2016, was the first date that it was practicable for Plaintiff to give notice of her need for FMLA leave, and the FMLA claims are also subject to summary judgment on that basis." [Doc. 71 at 30 n. 5]. This [*23]  Court agrees.
Regardless of whether Plaintiff's leave was foreseeable or unforeseeable, according to the record, it is clear that Plaintiff provided Ransom notice that she had at least potential grounds for requesting FMLA leave. She did not, however, indicate when this would happen. Furthermore, as the Magistrate Court noted, it is undisputed that Plaintiff has proffered no evidence to rebut Ransom's and Hosten's testimony that Ransom was not made aware of the request for a period of FMLA leave until Plaintiff's mental-health provider supplied Hosten with the certification on February 2, 2016—after Ransom had made the termination decision on January 27, 2016—and Hosten then apprised Ransom of Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave.
Additionally, the Magistrate Court determined, and this Court agrees, that it is undisputed that the leave request Plaintiff did submit to Ransom for January 27, 2016, was not for any kind of medical reason, but instead, was for training. Indeed, Plaintiff herself stated to her co-workers that she would be absent from work on January 27, 28, and 29, 2016, for training. Thus, to reach a determination that Ransom had notice that Plaintiff needed FMLA leave starting [*24]  on January 27, 2016, it would be necessary for a jury to find that Ransom should have known that the reason Plaintiff gave her in Plaintiff's written leave request, and reiterated to Plaintiff's co-workers, was false and that Plaintiff was, in fact, out of the office because she needed to start FMLA leave. This Court agrees with the Magistrate Court and finds that no reasonable jury could reach such a conclusion. Cf. Gay, 125 F.3d at 1436 ("When notice of a possible serious medical condition is deliberately withheld and false information is given, it cannot be said that an employee has been terminated in violation of the FMLA.").
It is clear that Plaintiff has failed to rebut the County's evidence that Ransom was unaware of Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave prior to Ransom's decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment. As the Eleventh Circuit has held, "the unrebutted evidence that the decision maker was not aware, at the time of the decision to terminate [Plaintiff], of [Plaintiff's] request to commence FMLA leave establishes as a matter of law that [Plaintiff]'s termination was for reasons other than her requested leave. [Defendant] is, therefore, entitled to summary judgment on the FMLA interference [*25]  claim." Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F. 3d at 1236.
For the foregoing reasons the Court ADOPTS this portion of the Final Report and Recommendation and OVERRULES Plaintiff's corresponding Objections.

2. FMLA Retaliation
Under the FMLA, an employer is prohibited from "discharg[ing] or in any other manner discriminat[ing] against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2). As the Eleventh Circuit has put it, "the substance of the FMLA provisions . . . is that an employer may not do bad things to an employee who has exercised or attempted to exercise any rights under the statute." Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 n.5 (11th Cir. 2000).
Where, as here, a plaintiff supports her claim of retaliation with circumstantial evidence, the claim is subject to the burden-shifting framework, as articulated by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Schaaf, 602 F.3d at 1243 ("In an FMLA retaliation case, unless there is direct evidence of the employer's retaliatory intent, this Court employs the burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas. . . ."). Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case. Brooks v. Cnty. Comm'n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., 446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir. 2006). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FMLA, the plaintiff must show that "(1) [s]he engaged in statutorily protected [*26]  conduct; (2) [s]he was adversely affected by an employment decision; and (3) there was a causal connection between the statutorily protected conduct and the adverse employment decision." Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1307 (11th Cir. 2006).
Even if the Court presumes Plaintiff successfully established a prima facie case, thereby satisfying the first step of the McDonnell Douglas framework, under the burden shifting analysis, the County must articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). A review of the record shows that the County clearly identified the reasons for Plaintiff's termination in Ransom's January 27, 2016, "Intent to Terminate" memorandum. As a result, the County has satisfied its burden of providing independent, nondiscriminatory basis for the adverse employment action. Id.
Pursuant to McDonnell Douglas, the burden then shifts back to Plaintiff to show that the County's "independent, nondiscriminatory" reasons were merely a pretext for discrimination. Id. "To satisfy this burden, [Plaintiff] must present evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision." Schaff, 602 F. 3d. at 1244. (internal citations and quotations [*27]  omitted). This, Plaintiff has failed to do. Therefore, summary judgment is proper on the issue of FMLA Retaliation and the Court hereby OVERRULES Plaintiff's objections to this portion of the Report and Recommendation.

B. ADA CLAIMS
The American with Disabilities Act (the "ADA) provides that no covered employer shall discriminate against "a qualified individual" with a disability because of the disability of such individual in any of the "terms, conditions, [or] privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Disability discrimination claims under the ADA include claims for failure to accommodate and claims for disparate treatment. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b); Rylee v. Chapman, 316 Fed. Appx. 901, 906 (11th Cir. Feb. 27, 2009); Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, 544 F.3d 1201, 1212 n.6 (11th Cir. 2008). Retaliation against a person claiming a right under the ADA or opposing a practice made unlawful by the ADA is also prohibited. 42 U.S.C. § 12203.

1. ADA-Discrimination
Disability discrimination may include an employer's failure to accommodate an employee with a disability. 42 U.S.C. 12112(b).
Plaintiff objects to the Magistrate Court's conclusion that Plaintiff has failed to point to any instance where the County failed to accommodate Plaintiff with written direction. [Doc. 71 at 34]. Plaintiff argues that the County failed to engage in an interactive process and "did absolutely nothing in response [to Plaintiff's [*28]  request that all her directives be in writing]." [Doc. 75 at 21]. However, the Eleventh Circuit has held that an employer's failure to engage in an interactive process regarding accommodation does not, in and of itself, amount to a violation of the ADA or relieve Plaintiff of her burden of demonstrating that the County failed to accommodate her See, Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F. 3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997). (holding that an employer cannot be held liable for merely failing to engage in the interactive process itself).
According to the record, Plaintiff has submitted no evidence that the County failed to provide directives in writing to Plaintiff. As the Magistrate Court noted and this Court agrees, there is no basis for a determination that the County failed to provide Plaintiff with the accommodation she requested. Accordingly, summary judgement is proper on the issue of ADA Retaliation, and the Court ADOPTS this portion of the Final Report and Recommendation and OVERRULES Plaintiff' objections.

2. ADA-Disability Retaliation
The ADA also prohibits retaliation against a person claiming a right under the ADA or opposing a practice made unlawful by the ADA. 42 U.S.C. 12203. Where ADA claims of retaliation are based on circumstantial evidence, courts in this [*29]  circuit use the Title VII McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Batson v. Salvation Army, 897 F.3d 1320, 1328-29 (11th Cir. 2018). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the first step of the McDonell Douglas burden-shifting framework, a plaintiff must show that she engaged in statutorily protected expression, she suffered an adverse employment action, and the adverse action was causally related to the protected expression. Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., 291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir. 2002).
Plaintiff objects to the Magistrate Court's conclusion that Plaintiff failed to rebut the County's legitimate, non-retaliatory explanation for why Plaintiff's employment was terminated by the County. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that (1) the Magistrate Court ignored evidence that, after November 2015, Plaintiff repeatedly told Ransom Plaintiff's disabilities were preventing Plaintiff from passing the SHRM certification; and (2) the Magistrate Court placed too much emphasis on the fact that Plaintiff's original leave request did not disclose that the request was for ATD training.
The Magistrate Court found that the Plaintiff established a prima facie case; she created an inference of discrimination, which then shifted the burden to the County to show a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its challenged action. [*30]  Brooks, 446 F.3d at 1162. The Magistrate Court went on to find that the County satisfied this burden, contending that the County fired Plaintiff because Ransom said no to Plaintiff's request to attend ATD training. [Doc 71 at 36]. By doing so, the County rebutted the inference of discrimination, and the inquiry "'proceeds to a new level of specificity,' in which the plaintiff must show that the proffered reason really is a pretext for unlawful discrimination." Brooks, 446 F.3d at 1162 (quoting EEOC v. Joe's Stone Crab, Inc., 296 F.3d 1265, 1272-73 (11th Cir. 2002)).
Plaintiff argues that the "close temporal proximity between Plaintiff's continued complaints and her termination is significant." [Doc. 75 at 22]. However, the record shows that from May, 2015, until Plaintiff's termination on January 27, 2016, Plaintiff's SHRM certification was at issue. Additionally, the ATD training, as well as Plaintiff's solicitation of funds to pay for the training and her actual attendance of the training class without calling in, provide legitimate reasons for Plaintiff's termination. After a review of the evidence and the law relating to this matter, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to produce evidence showing the "asserted reason is merely pretext for discrimination." Brooks, 446 F.3d at 1163. For the foregoing reasons, the Court [*31]  finds that summary judgment is proper on the issue of ADA Discrimination, ADOPTS this portion of the Final Report and Recommendation, and OVERRULES Plaintiff's corresponding Objections.

IV. CONCLUSION
In sum, after reviewing, de novo, the portions of the R&R to which Plaintiff raised specific objections and reviewing the remaining parts of the R&R for plain error according to United States v. Slay, 714 F.2d 1093, 1095 (11th Cir. 1983), the Court receives the R & R [Doc. 71] with approval and adopts its findings and legal conclusions as the Opinion of this Court. Accordingly, Plaintiff's Objections are OVERRULLED [Doc. 75] and the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 47] is hereby GRANTED. Judgment is hereby entered in favor of the Defendant and the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate this case.
IT IS SO ORDERED, this 19th day of September, 2019.
