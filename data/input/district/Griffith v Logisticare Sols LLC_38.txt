CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): Order GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint
Before the Court is Defendant Logisticare Solutions, LLC's motion to dismiss Plaintiff Raven Griffith's Second Amended Complaint ("SAC") pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), or in the alternative to strike superfluous allegations pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). Dkt. # 26. The Court finds this matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. Having considered the arguments in the papers, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's motion to dismiss and DENIES Defendant's motion to strike. To the extent the Court has granted Defendant's motion, the causes of action are dismissed WITH PREJUDICE.
I. Background
Plaintiff Raven Griffith was employed as a transportation coordinator for Defendant Logisticare Solutions, LLC from March 31, 2014 to September 11, 2015, when she was terminated for "logging in and out on her phone for work." SAC ¶¶ 13-14, 31. Griffith's position required her to ensure that [*2]  Logisticare's clients received timely and adequate non-emergency transport to medical appointments. Id. ¶ 14. Griffith asserts that she completed her job duties satisfactorily, and received a satisfactory performance review from her supervisor months before her termination. Id. ¶ 15.
Griffith identifies as African-American and Latina, and her family is from Belize. Id. ¶ 16. She asserts that her co-workers harassed her at the workplace because of her race. Id. ¶¶ 17-19. One of the co-workers, Courtney, allegedly made derogatory statements about Griffith's Belizean heritage and said that Griffith was "just regular black people." Id. ¶ 17. Griffith asserts that Courtney tore papers away from her and was "unwarrantedly rude." Id. Other co-workers allegedly did not tell Griffith about calls for her. Id. ¶ 19. Griffith complained to her supervisor, Amy, about the conduct, but Amy allegedly did not take action and instead yelled at Griffith in a meeting. Id. ¶ 18.
Griffith asserts that she developed anxiety and depression as a result of the conduct, and that her medical conditions led to loss of breath, an inability to concentrate, and other "substantial limitations." Id. ¶¶ 19, 21. Griffith [*3]  allegedly told Amy and another supervisor, Joshua, as well as Natasha and Fatima in Human Resources about her anxiety, but they did nothing. Id. ¶¶ 20, 28. Griffith later asked Amy, Joshua, Natasha, Fatima, and others for time off to visit a medical professional, but her supervisors told her that if she did so, she would lose her job. Id. ¶¶ 20-21, 25.
Griffith also asserts that she provided Logisticare with a doctor's note that recommended that she take time off work. Id. ¶¶ 22, 26. Griffith formally took leave in April 2015 and again from June to August 2015. Id. ¶¶ 22, 26. Griffith also requested extended leave in August 2015, but this request was denied. Id. ¶ 27. Although Griffith presented a doctor's note and gave advance notice of her leave, Logisticare allegedly wrote Griffith up for missing work, and co-workers said that she was "playing the victim." Id. ¶¶ 22-23. Although Griffith reported her co-workers' comments, she asserts that management did nothing to stop the conduct. Id. ¶ 23. Later, when she returned from leave, Griffith alleges that she was given less desirable work than other employees. Id. ¶ 29. Logisticare ultimately terminated Griffith in September 2015, and [*4]  Plaintiff alleges that at least one of her supervisors, Joshua, was involved in the termination decision. Id. ¶ 31.
Griffith then filed this lawsuit on September 20, 2016 in state court, and Logisticare removed the case to federal court on November 21, 2016. See Dkt. # 1. On March 9, 2017, the Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint with leave to amend. See Order Granting Motion to Dismiss ("March 9 Order"), Dkt. # 23. Griffith then filed the SAC, which is the operative complaint. Dkt. # 25.
The SAC asserts fourteen causes of action for: (1) retaliation for complaints of discrimination and/or harassment in violation of FEHA; (2) retaliation for complaints of discrimination and/or harassment in violation of public policy; (3) disability discrimination in violation of FEHA; (4) disability discrimination in violation of public policy; (5) retaliation for requests for accommodation and/or complaints of disability discrimination and/or harassment in violation of FEHA; (6) retaliation for requests for accommodation and/or complaints of disability discrimination and/or harassment in violation of public policy; (7) family and medical leave discrimination/interference [*5]  in violation of FEHA; (8) family and medical leave discrimination/interference in violation of public policy; (9) retaliation for requests for family and medical leave, complaints of family and medical leave discrimination and/or harassment in violation of FEHA; (10) retaliation for requests for family and medical leave, complaints of family and medical leave discrimination and/or harassment in violation of public policy; (11) tortious discharge against public policy relating to employees who make reports of workplace injuries; (12) failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA; (13) failure to accommodate in violation of FEHA; and (14) failure to do everything reasonably necessary to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation from occurring in violation of FEHA. See generally SAC.
Defendant now moves to dismiss all the causes of action in the SAC as conclusory and failing to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). See Motion to Dismiss ("Mot."), Dkt. # 26, 12-19. Defendant also moves to strike paragraphs 37, 39-42, 51, 53-56, 70-73, 88-91, 102-05, 116-19, 149-50, 158, 160-63, 171, and 173-76 of the SAC as redundant and immaterial. See Notice of Mot. 4:17-20. Plaintiff opposes [*6]  the motion.1 See Opposition ("Opp."), Dkt. # 27.
II. Legal Standard
A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests whether the complaint "contain[s] sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). When deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must accept the facts pleaded in the complaint as true, and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Faulkner v. ADT Sec. Servs., Inc., 706 F.3d 1017, 1019 (9th Cir. 2013); Cousins v. Lockyer, 568 F.3d 1063, 1067-68 (9th Cir. 2009). The Court, however, is not required to accept "legal conclusions . . . cast in the form of factual allegations." W. Mining Council v. Watt, 643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir. 1981); see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.
After accepting all non-conclusory allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, the court must determine whether the complaint alleges a plausible claim to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679-80. "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. . . . The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Id. at 678.
III. Discussion
FEHA prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of, inter alia, race, color, and physical [*7]  and mental disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). The California Family Rights Act ("CFRA") is a portion of FEHA that allows eligible employees to take unpaid medical leave to care for themselves or a sick family member. Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2. Plaintiff asserts thirteen of her fourteen causes of action under FEHA, and one tort law cause of action (tortious discharge) under various sections of the California Labor Code. Although Plaintiff asserts that some of Defendant's conduct is in violation of "public policy," the Court construes these public policy claims as FEHA claims because the only "public policy" alleged in these causes of action is FEHA. See FAC ¶¶ 48-49, 80, 113, 141, 170.
The Court groups Plaintiffs' fourteen causes of action into six sections: (A) retaliation (Claims One, Two, Five, and Six); (B) disability discrimination (Claims Three and Four); (C) medical leave discrimination, interference, and retaliation (Claims Seven, Eight, Nine, and Ten); (D) failure to engage in interactive process and to provide reasonable accommodations (Claims Twelve and Thirteen); (E) failure to stop harassment (Claim Fourteen); and (F) tortious discharge (Claim Eleven). See generally SAC. After reviewing each cause of action, the Court [*8]  then considers Defendants' motion to strike and whether to grant leave to amend.
A. Retaliation (Claims One, Two, Five, and Six)
Plaintiff's first, second, fifth, and sixth causes of action are for retaliation. See SAC ¶¶ 34-60, 97-124. Plaintiff asserts that she complained of discrimination and harassment, and requested accommodations, and was terminated for filing these complaints and requests. See id. The first and second causes of action are for retaliation based on the complaints of racial harassment and discrimination, and the fifth and sixth causes of action are for retaliation based on the complaints of disability harassment and discrimination, and for requests for reasonable accommodation and medical leave.
To assert a prima facie retaliation claim under FEHA, "the plaintiff must show that [s]he engaged in a protected activity, [her] employer subjected [her] to adverse employment action, and there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." Strother v. S. Cal. Permanente Med. Grp., 79 F.3d 859, 868 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing Flait v. North Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal.App.4th 467, 476, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992)). "Protected activity" means that the employee "has opposed any practices forbidden under [FEHA] . . . or has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under [FEHA]." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(h).
On March 9, [*9]  2017, the Court granted Defendant's earlier motion to dismiss the retaliation claims because Plaintiff had not adequately alleged a "protected activity," or a "causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." See March 9 Order 7-8. The Court reasoned that Plaintiff had made only conclusory allegations about her complaints, or had alleged activities that were not considered "protected" under California law at the time the conduct occurred. See id. (citing Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 245-46, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016)). Plaintiff also pled insufficient facts to establish a causal link between the protected activity and her termination. See id. at 8.
In the SAC, Plaintiff provides additional facts about the complaints that she filed with her supervisors, Amy and Joshua, and with Human Resources representatives, Natasha and Fatima. See SAC ¶¶ 18, 20, 23, 28. Griffith allegedly told these supervisors about, what she believed to be, harassing comments from her co-workers and revealed that the comments had caused her to develop anxiety and depression. Id. ¶¶ 18, 20. Although Griffith does not allege when or how she communicated her complaints to supervisors, the facts alleged in the SAC are not conclusory because they identify both the recipients [*10]  and content of the complaints. See id.; see also Faulkner, 706 F.3d at 1019 (requiring the Court to accept the facts in the pleadings as true and to interpret them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party). These facts are sufficient to establish that Plaintiff engaged in a protected activity by filing complaints of race and disability harassment and discrimination with her supervisors, and they put Defendant on notice of the types of complaints filed.
The SAC does not address, however, the Court's prior legal conclusion that, in 2014 and 2015, when Plaintiff alleges that she requested time off from work, California law under FEHA did not recognize a request for time off as a "protected activity." See March 9 Order 7-8. In its March 9 Order, the Court reviewed the California Court of Appeal's decision in Moore and concluded that, in 2014 and 2015, "a request for an accommodation, without more, was insufficient to constitute protected activity." Id. at 7 (citing Moore, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 245-26, and Rope v. Auto Chlor Sys. of Wash., Inc., 220 Cal. App. 4th 635, 652, 163 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392 (2013)). Although the California legislature later amended the FEHA statute to include requests for accommodation, the amendments did not apply retroactively to Griffith's requests for time off. See Moore, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 247. In the SAC and the Opposition, Griffith fails to [*11]  address this argument or to provide any reason why she should be permitted to assert a retaliation claim based on a request for accommodations in light of Moore. Because Griffith offers no new information to persuade the Court that its prior reasoning is incorrect, the Court GRANTS Logisticare's motion to dismiss the fifth and sixth causes of action for retaliation to the extent they are premised on Griffith's allegations that she engaged in "protected activity" when she requested and was denied time off work.
Because Plaintiff has only established that her complaints of harassment and discrimination—and not her requests for accommodation—are a protected activity, the Court now turns to whether Plaintiff has established a causal link between her complaints and an "adverse employment action." In the SAC, Plaintiff asserts that the adverse employment action is "termination, failure to rehire, and/or failure to reinstate." See SAC ¶¶ 43-44, 57-58, 106-07, 120-21, 164-65, 177-78. Although Defendant contends that these "and/or" assertions make it impossible for Defendant to know exactly what conduct is at issue here, the Court does not find the pleadings problematic in this regard. Whether [*12]  the "adverse employment action" is classified technically as a termination, failure to rehire, or failure to reinstate is of little moment here, given that it is clear to all involved that Plaintiff involuntarily left her employment with Logisticare in September 2015.
To assert a causal link between the complaints of harassment and discrimination, and her termination from Logisticare, plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to raise a plausible inference that her protected activity was a "likely" reason for the adverse action. See Washington v. Cal. City Correction Ctr., 871 F. Supp. 2d 1010, 1028-29 (E.D. Cal. 2012). At minimum, the plaintiff must assert that the employer was aware that the plaintiff had engaged in the protected activity. See Cohen v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 686 F.2d 793, 796 (9th Cir. 1982); Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1250-51, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008). A causal connection might be inferred from the timing of a discharge decision if the temporal proximity is "very close," see Washington, 871 F. Supp. 2d at 1029, or from facts that suggest that similarly situated employees who did not complain were treated more favorably, see Dodson v. FedEx Corporate Servs., Inc., 679 Fed. Appx. 551, 2017 WL 631698, at *3 (9th Cir. 2017); see also Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 225, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999); Flait v. N. Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal. App. 4th 467, 476, 479, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992).
Here, Griffith pleads sufficient facts to assert a plausible claim that there was a causal connection between her complaints of harassment and discrimination, and her termination. Plaintiff asserts that she filed complaints with her supervisor, Joshua, and that Joshua was involved [*13]  in the decision to terminate Griffith's employment. See SAC ¶ 31. This fact not only suggests that the employer knew of the protected activity but also that the termination decision is linked in some way to the bad conduct. Plaintiff further alleges that she filed complaints on at least three occasions, see SAC ¶¶ 17, 20, 23, which is further support for Plaintiff's allegation that the complaints were not de minimis and that the employer knew of the protected conduct. Although Griffith does not plead the dates of the complaints, she asserts that she was given less desirable work than similarly situated employees in the months before her termination. See id. ¶ 23. Taken together, these facts are sufficient to state a plausible causal connection between the complaints and the adverse employment action.
In light of the above, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss claims Five and Six to the extent that they are premised on Griffith's allegations that she engaged in "protected activity" when she requested and was denied time off work. However, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss claims One, Two, Five, and Six to the extent these causes of action are premised on Plaintiff's [*14]  allegations that she engaged in "protected activity" when she filed complaints of harassment and discrimination and subsequently suffered an adverse employment action.
B. Disability Discrimination (Claims Three and Four)
Plaintiff's third and fourth causes of action are for disability discrimination. SAC ¶¶ 61-96. To establish disability discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must assert sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that she "(1) suffered from a disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability, (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or perceived disability." Wills v. Superior Court, 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 159-60, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In granting Defendant's earlier motion to dismiss, the Court held that Plaintiff had not pled sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that she could perform the essential duties of her job with reasonable accommodations or to establish a causal link between her disability and the adverse employment decision. See Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the FAC, Dkt. # 23, at 5. Defendant does not contend here, and it [*15]  did not contend in the first motion to dismiss, that Plaintiff has not adequately alleged a disability under California law. Given that Defendant's challenge is limited to the second and third elements of a disability discrimination claim under FEHA and the SAC cures the defects raised in the first motion, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss the third and fourth causes of action.
Turning first to whether Griffith is able to perform the essential duties of her job, Griffith alleges that Logisticare required her to ensure that its clients received timely and appropriate non-emergency transportation to medical appointments. SAC ¶ 14. Griffith alleges that she completed all tasks competently and that she received a positive performance review just months before her September 2015 termination. See id. ¶¶ 14, 15. These factual allegations are sufficient to place Defendant on notice of the basis for Plaintiff's claim that she could perform her job adequately, and so they meet the Iqbal and Twombly pleading standards.
Turning next to whether there is a causal link between Plaintiff's disability and her termination, the SAC also pleads sufficient facts to state a plausible claim of [*16]  a causal link. To establish a causal link, the plaintiff's disability must have been a "substantial motivating factor in the particular employment decision." Harris v. Santa Monica, 56 Cal. 4th 203, 232, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 294 P.3d 49 (2013). A discriminatory motive does not have to be the only motive for the adverse employment action. See Dark v. Curry Cty., 451 F.3d 1078, 1084-85 (9th Cir. 2006). The law forbids adverse employment decisions motivated, even in part, by animus based on disability. See Head v. Glacier NW, Inc., 413 F.3d 1053, 1065 (9th Cir. 2005). Moreover, although there is a "distinction between termination of employment because of misconduct and termination of employment because of a disability," Collings v. Longview Fibre Co., 63 F.3d 828, 832 (9th Cir. 1995), "conduct resulting from a disability is considered to be part of the disability, rather than a separate basis for termination," Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1139-40 (9th Cir. 2001).
Logisticare's official reason for Plaintiff's termination is that Plaintiff was terminated for "logging in and out on her phone for work." SAC ¶¶ 13-14, 31. This reason does not constitute conduct resulting from anxiety or depression, and Plaintiff does not argue that it does. Rather, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason is mere pretext, and that Plaintiff's anxiety and depression, and the time she took off work to attend to the disabilities, were a factor in her termination. SAC ¶¶ 83, 87-88.
Plaintiff asserts [*17]  sufficient facts to establish a plausible claim that there is a causal connection between her disability and medical leave, and the termination. Plaintiff alleges that her supervisors, Amy and Joshua, and Human Resources employees, Natasha and Fatima, told her that she would be terminated if she took leave. See id. ¶¶ 20-21, 25, 28. Plaintiff also alleged that she was written up for taking leave and denied extended leave, and she alleges that the supervisor that denied her leave was involved in her termination decision. Id. ¶¶ 22-23, 27, 31. Although Defendant might quibble with the veracity of these statements, the motion to dismiss is not the time for such credibility challenges. If Plaintiff's facts are to be believed, as they must be at this phase in the litigation, they state a plausible claim that Plaintiff's disability was a substantial factor in the termination decision. The motion to dismiss these causes of action is therefore DENIED.
C. Medical Leave Interference and Retaliation (Claims Seven, Eight, Nine, and Ten)
Plaintiff's seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action are for medical leave discrimination and interference, and retaliation in violation of FEHA. See SAC [*18]  ¶¶ 125-80. CFRA is the section of FEHA that addresses medical leave claims. CFRA makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer of fifty or more persons to refuse to grant a request by an "eligible employee" to take up to 12 work weeks in any 12-month period for family care and medical leave. Cal. Gov. Code § 12945.2(c). To be eligible for CFRA protection, the claimant must be an "employee with more than 12 months of service with the employer, and who has at least 1,250 hours of service with the employer during the previous 12-month period." Id. "Violations of . . . CFRA generally fall into two types of claims: (1) 'interference' claims in which an employee alleges that an employer denied or interfered with her substantive rights to protected medical leave, and (2) 'retaliation' claims in which an employee alleges that she suffered an adverse employment action for exercising her right to CFRA leave." Bareno v. San Diego Cmty. College Dist., 7 Cal. App. 5th 546, 558-59, 212 Cal. Rptr. 3d 682 (2017) (citing Rogers v. County of Los Angeles, 198 Cal. App. 4th 480, 487-88, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 350 (2011)). Plaintiff here alleges both interference and retaliation CFRA claims.
In its March 9 Order, the Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's medical leave inference and retaliation claims because Plaintiff had not established that she was entitled to CFRA protection, that Logisticare [*19]  was covered by CFRA, or that Logisticare interfered with her right to leave or penalized her for taking leave. See March 9 Order 8-9. As an initial matter, the SAC alleges that Defendant employed more than fifty people in a seventy-five mile radius and that Plaintiff worked more than 1,250 hours. See SAC ¶ 28. This allegation alone is sufficient to address the Court's concern that Plaintiff might not be eligible and that Defendant might not be covered by CFRA. Having established that CFRA applies, the SAC goes on to plead sufficient facts to establish a plausible claim of interference and retaliation.
A CFRA interference claim consists of two elements: (1) the employee's entitlement to CFRA leave rights; and (2) the employer's interference with or denial of those rights. Moore, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 250. "Interference" includes "not only refusing to authorize [] leave, but discouraging an employee from using such leave." Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1133 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(b) and instructing courts to interpret CFRA in the same way as the FMLA). An employer cannot "use the taking of [] leave as a negative factor in employment actions." See id. In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges that she was "written up" for missing work to see the doctor, and told that if she took [*20]  leave from work, she would be terminated. See SAC ¶¶ 22-23. Logisticare also denied Plaintiff's request for more extended leave. See id. Plaintiff also alleges that she was mocked at work as "playing the victim," and that the employer did not discourage these comments even after Plaintiff complained. Id. Interpreting the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, these facts establish that Logisticare at least discouraged Plaintiff from taking leave by threatening negative action if Plaintiff took leave and by not acting to stop other employees from creating an environment where leave was discouraged. The Court therefore DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's CFRA interference claims.
A CFRA retaliation claim consists of three elements: (1) the employee's entitlement to leave rights; (2) the plaintiff exercised her right to take leave; and (3) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, fine, or suspension because she exercised CFRA leave. Bareno v. San Diego Cmty. College Dist., 7 Cal. App. 5th 546, 560, 212 Cal. Rptr. 3d 682 (2017). Plaintiff established the first two elements of a retaliation claim by alleging that she and Logisticare are covered by CFRA, and that she took leave. SAC ¶¶ 22, 26, 28. Moreover, as the Court indicated [*21]  above, the facts plead in the SAC are sufficient to raise a plausible inference that Plaintiff's termination is causally connected to her leave or requests for leave. See supra Section II.B. Plaintiff alleges that she requested timely leave and provided a doctor's note, but later was written up for taking leave and denied more extended leave. Id. ¶¶ 22-23. Plaintiff also alleges that when she returned from leave, she was given less desirable work, such as fielding calls, and was "unfairly and repeatedly criticized" by her supervisors. Id. ¶ 29. Moreover, because Plaintiff alleges that she last took leave in August 2015 and was ultimately terminated in September 2015, the temporal proximity between the leave and the termination is sufficiently close to state a plausible claim of a causal connection.
In light of the above facts and the improvements that Plaintiff made to the factual allegations in the SAC, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action for interference and retaliation in violation of the CFRA.
D. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process and Provide Reasonable Accommodations (Claims Twelve and Thirteen)
Plaintiff's twelfth [*22]  and thirteenth claims are for failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to provide reasonable accommodations. SAC ¶¶ 196-220. Plaintiff asserts that she requested reasonable accommodations when she requested time off work to seek treatment and to recover from anxiety and depression, and that Defendant's denial of the request was unreasonable. On March 9, the Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss these interactive process and reasonable accommodations claims because Plaintiff had not plead that she was otherwise qualified to perform her job or that her requests for time off were reasonable. See March 9 Order 10-11.
FEHA requires employers "to engage in a timely, good faith, and interactive process with [a disabled] employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodations by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). This requires "communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identify[ing] an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) [*23] .
A reasonable accommodation is "a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal.-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1010, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "A term of leave from work can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA, and therefore, a request for leave can be considered to be a request for accommodation under FEHA." Moore, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 243 (citing Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999)).
To assert a claim for failure to provide reasonable accommodations, the plaintiff must assert that (1) she has a disability covered by FEHA; (2) she is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position; and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability. Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal.-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1010, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). To prevail on a claim under this section, "[a]n employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1009-10.
As the Court already noted above, see supra Section III.B, the SAC pleads sufficient facts to establish that Plaintiff was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of her position. Plaintiff asserts that she received a positive performance review just months before she was terminated, and she never failed to ensure that Logisticare's clients had [*24]  transportation to their non-emergency medical appointments. See SAC ¶¶ 14-15.
The facts in the SAC also establish a plausible claim that Logisticare did not engage in a "good-faith exploration of possible accommodations" and that Plaintiff's request for time off was reasonable. Plaintiff alleges that her supervisors told her that she would lose her job if she took time off work, and Plaintiff's supervisors allegedly wrote her up when she took time off work despite the supervisors' warnings. Id. ¶¶ 20-23, 25. Plaintiff further alleges that her supervisor, Amy, yelled at her when she tried to discuss the racially motivated comments that were stoking Plaintiff's anxiety. See id. ¶ 17. Because there is no indication that Logisticare discussed accommodations with Griffith or recommended alternative accommodations, Plaintiff has stated a plausible claim that Logisticare failed to engage in interactive process.
The facts in the SAC—credited in Plaintiff's favor as they must be at this phase in the litigation—further establish a plausible claim that the accommodations that Plaintiff requested were reasonable. "A reasonable accommodation is a modification or adjustment to the work environment [*25]  that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job he or she holds or desires." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 373, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015). "[A] finite leave can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA, provided it is likely that at the end of the leave, the employee would be able to perform his or her duties." Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 226. A reasonable accommodation does not, however, "require the employer to wait indefinitely for an employee's medical condition to be corrected." Id. at 226-27.
The accommodation that Plaintiff requested was additional time off work to seek medical treatment for her anxiety and depression. Id. ¶ 20. Although Plaintiff had already taken time off work in April 2015 and again from June to August 2015 to attend to her anxiety and depression, Plaintiff alleges that additional time off would have allowed her to manage her anxiety and depression so that she could return to work and perform competently. See id. Plaintiff also alleges that she provided her employer with a doctor's note and gave advance notice of her request for leave. Id. ¶¶ 22-23. Although Defendant may have had good reason to believe that Plaintiff's leave would have gone on indefinitely and therefore would not be reasonable, the Court cannot make this determination [*26]  at the motion to dismiss phase. At this point, the pled facts establish a plausible claim that Plaintiff's request for additional leave and the circumstances surrounding the request were reasonable.
Because the SAC cures the defects that the Court identified in the FAC, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss claims twelve and thirteen for failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to provide reasonable accommodations.
E. Failure to Do Everything Reasonably Necessary to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation from Occurring in Violation of FEHA (Claim Fourteen)
Plaintiff's fourteenth cause of action is for failure to do everything reasonably necessary to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. SAC ¶¶ 221-27. FEHA holds employers liable for failing to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. See Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(k). In its March 9 Order, the Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss this cause of action because Plaintiff had not plead a cause of action for discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Here, the Court has already found that Plaintiff pled causes of action for retaliation and discrimination, and [*27]  thus, Plaintiff has already cured the defects noted in the SAC. See supra Sections III.A—C. Plaintiff has abandoned her harassment claim. Opp. 17:1-2.
Pleading an underlying claim for retaliation and discrimination satisfies, however, only the first element of a failure to stop discrimination and retaliation cause of action. To successfully plead a cause of action for failure to stop discrimination and retaliation, Plaintiff must additionally assert facts sufficient to plead a plausible claim that "the defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination" and "this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 804 (N.D. Cal. 2015); Cal. Civil Jury Instruction (BAJI) 12.11.
The SAC alleges sufficient facts to satisfy these elements too. The SAC alleges that Griffith told her supervisors about her anxiety and depression, and about her co-workers' offensive comments, but Griffith's supervisors allegedly did nothing to prevent discrimination or retaliation. SAC ¶¶ 18, 20, 23. Although Plaintiff does not offer any specific, "reasonable" steps that the employer could have taken, it is enough, at this juncture, for Plaintiff to allege that her supervisors did nothing in light [*28]  of the complaints. Plaintiff also establishes that she was harmed by the supervisors' failure as her anxiety and depression worsened and persisted through her employment. See id. ¶¶ 23, 27. Plaintiff additionally alleges that she was terminated for her disability and for filing complaints seeking accommodations. See id. ¶ 31. These facts are sufficient to establish that the employer could have taken additional reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and retaliation, and that plaintiff suffered harm as a result of the employer's failures.
In light of the above, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's fourteenth cause of action to the extent it is premised on a failure to stop discrimination and retaliation. The motion is GRANTED, however, to the extent it is premised on a harassment claim because Plaintiff has abandoned her harassment claim.
F. Tortious Discharge (Claim Eleven)
Plaintiff's eleventh cause of action is for tortious discharge in violation of public policy. In California, at will employees may bring a tort action for wrongful discharge if their employer discharges them for a reason that violates fundamental public policy. See Nelson v. United Techs., 74 Cal. App. 4th 597, 608, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 239 (1999) (citing Tameny v. Atl. Richfield Co., 27 Cal. 3d 167, 176, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330 (1980)). The availability [*29]  of the tort helps prevent employers from using the threat of termination to coerce employees to conceal wrongful acts or engage in conduct harmful to the public welfare. See id.
Here, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to raise a plausible inference that her termination from Logisticare was the result of unlawful retaliation or disability discrimination. In light of the above, the Court cannot determine as a matter of law that Plaintiff will not be able to state a claim for tortious discharge. The Court therefore DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss the eleventh cause of action for tortious discharge.
G. Motion to Strike
In addition to moving to dismiss all causes of action on 12(b)(6) grounds, Defendant moves to strike various paragraphs in the SAC under Rule 12(f). Rule 12(f) provides that a court may "order stricken from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). Courts often require a showing of prejudice by the moving party before granting a motion to strike, and for this reason, federal courts routinely disfavor such motions. See Shabaz v. Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1205, 1209 (C.D. Cal. 2008) ("Motions to strike are generally disfavored, and 'are generally not granted unless it is clear that the matter [*30]  to be stricken could have no possible bearing on the subject matter of litigation.'" (internal citations omitted)); Cal. Dep't of Toxic Substances Control v. Alco Pacific, Inc., 217 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 1033 (C.D. Cal. 2002). Whether to grant a motion to strike is within the sound discretion of the district court. See Greenwich Ins. Co. v. Rodgers, 729 F. Supp. 2d 1158, 1162 (C.D. Cal. 2010).
Defendant asks the Court to strike paragraphs 37, 39-42, 51, 53-56, 70-73, 88-91, 102-05, 116-19, 149-50, 158, 160-63, 171, and 173-76 of the SAC as redundant and immaterial. See Notice of Mot. 4:17-20. These paragraphs are spattered through Plaintiff's causes of action, and the only reasons Defendant offers to exclude the paragraphs are that (1) they are unsupported by evidence and (2) imprecise. See Mot. 19:23-20:10. Defendant has not shown, however, that the presence of the paragraphs is prejudicial to its ability to defend this case. Indeed, the Court has already rejected Defendant's objection to Plaintiff's "and/or" pleading style, given that discovery has not yet occurred and Plaintiff is still entitled to some flexibility in the theories that she may use to prosecute her case.
Because Defendant has not shown that the identified paragraphs do not have any possible bearing on the outcome of this litigation, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to strike.
H. Leave to Amend [*31] 
"Generally, [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 15 advises the court that 'leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.' This policy is 'to be applied with extreme liberality.'" Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1051 (9th Cir. 2003) (per curium) (quoting Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 244 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. 2001)). However, leave to amend may be withheld when it is clear that the complaint cannot be saved by further amendment. Leadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music Pub., 512 F.3d 522, 532 (9th Cir. 2008).
Here, the Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's fifth and sixth causes of action for retaliation to the extent that Plaintiff based these claims on her allegations that she engaged in "protected activity" when she requested and was denied time off of work. Plaintiff cannot base her retaliation claims on this conduct because, at the time Plaintiff alleges that the conduct occurred, California law did not treat a request for reasonable accommodations as a "protected activity." See supra Section III.A. The Court cited the relevant California law in its March 9 Order granting Defendant's first motion to dismiss, see March 9 Order 7-8, but Plaintiff failed to respond to the relevant legal arguments or to distinguish the California cases in the most recent Opposition. Plaintiff's failure to address the relevant legal authorities despite having advance notice of the arguments indicates to [*32]  the Court that granting further leave to amend these causes of action would be futile.
The Court also granted Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's fourteenth cause of action for failure to do everything reasonably necessary to prevent discrimination, retaliation, and harassment, but only to the extent that Plaintiff premised this fourteenth cause of action on a harassment claim. See supra Section III.E. Plaintiff concedes that she has not pled a cause of action for harassment. See Opp. 17:1-2 ("Plaintiff does not have a cause of action for harassment."). The law is clear that Plaintiff cannot assert a claim for failure to stop harassment until she has adequately pled a harassment claim. See Harris v. Lynwood Unified Sch. Dist., No. CV 07-5058 DDP (CTx), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87655, 2009 WL 2900313, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2013). Because Plaintiff has abandoned her harassment claim, it would be futile to grant Plaintiff leave to amend her fourteenth cause of action to support a claim for failure to stop harassment.
In light of the above, the Court will not grant Plaintiff leave to amend the causes of action that it dismissed in this Order.
IV. Conclusion
The SAC contained fourteen causes of action related to Plaintiff Griffith's termination from Logisticare. Having reviewed [*33]  the arguments in the papers, the Court holds as follows:
(1) Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's first, second, fifth, and sixth causes of action for retaliation is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The Court DENIES Defendant's motion as to Counts One, Two, Five, and Six to the extent these claims are based on Plaintiff's allegations that she engaged in protected activity when she filed complaints of race and disability discrimination and harassment with management. However, the Court GRANTS WITH PREJUDICE Defendant's motion as to Counts Five and Six to the extent these claims are based on Griffith's allegations that she engaged in "protected activity" when she requested and was denied time off of work. At the time Plaintiff alleges that she requested time off of work, California law did not treat a request for reasonable accommodations as a "protected activity" that would support a retaliation claim under FEHA.
(2) Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's third and fourth causes of action for disability discrimination is DENIED.
(3) Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action for interference and retaliation in violation of the [*34]  CFRA is DENIED.
(4) Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's twelfth and thirteenth causes of action for failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to provide reasonable accommodations is DENIED.
(5) Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's fourteenth cause of action for failure to do everything reasonably necessary to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The motion is GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE to the extent this claim is premised on an underlying harassment claim. However, it is DENIED to the extent the claim is based on the underlying discrimination and retaliation claims.
(6) Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's eleventh cause of action for tortious discharge is DENIED.
(7) Defendant's motion to strike paragraphs 37, 39-42, 51, 53-56, 70-73, 88-91, 102-05, 116-19, 149-50, 158, 160-63, 171, and 173-76 from the SAC is DENIED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
