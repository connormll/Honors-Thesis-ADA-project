Opinion



ORDER
Presently pending before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 54). For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 54) is GRANTED.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND1
Plaintiff began employment with the Department of the Navy (hereinafter "Department") in 1997 as a welder for the Maintenance Center at the Marine Corps Logistics Command (hereinafter "MCLB"), in Albany, Georgia. During his employment with the Department, after exhausting all administrative remedies before the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), Plaintiff filed a boilerplate complaint against Defendant in this Court on January 15, 2004, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Privacy Act, and unidentified workers' compensation laws. Branscomb v. Hansford T. Johnson,2 Case No. 1:04-cv-4 (M.D. Ga. Jan. 15, 2004) (hereinafter "2004 case" or "Case No. 1:04-cv-4). [*2]  Plaintiff based his complaint on treatment he had received from Defendant in response to his report of a 2001 on-the-job injury and more specifically, his attempt to file a claim with the Office of Workers' Compensation Program ("OWCP"). (Doc. 55-3 at 2).
According to the complaint, Plaintiff's supervisor "ignored and then later filed a misleading accident report to workman's comp[,] delayed submission of accident report[, and] . . . improperly participated in the workers' compensation process [by] . . . cop[ying] and distribut[ing] private confidential medical records in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974." (Id.). In a June 22, 2005 order granting Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on the 2004 Complaint, this Court held that Plaintiff's claim failed to state a claim against Defendant under Title VII and unspecified workers' compensation law and rules and also held Plaintiff's Privacy Act claim barred due to his failure to exhaust administrative remedies. (Doc. 55-3 at 8 to 9).
Meanwhile, Plaintiff initiated the administrative process to challenge his March 26, 2004 termination from the Department, which Defendant based on Plaintiff's failure to obtain required welding certifications [*3]  for his welder position. On April 18, 2005, on hearing before Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB") Administrative Judge Pamela Jackson in Macon, Georgia, Defendant's termination of Plaintiff was affirmed. (See Doc. 51-5 (Branscomb v. Dep't of the Navy, 2005 MSPB LEXIS 4604 (2005))). Judge Jackson found that Plaintiff admitted that he could not perform the welding position with or without accommodation and that he was not disabled within the meaning of the Americans with Disability Act ("ADA"). (Id.)
On March 28, 2006, the full MSPB upheld Judge Jackson's decision as follows:
After fully considering the filings in this appeal, we conclude that there is no new, previously unavailable, evidence and that the administrative judge made no error in law or regulation that affects the outcome. 5 C.F.R. § 1201.115(d). Therefore, we DENY the petition for review. The initial decision of the administrative judge is final. This is the Board's final decision in this matter. 5 C.F.R. § 1201.113.
(Doc. 59-1 at 52 (Branscomb v. Dep't of the Navy, 2006 MSPB LEXIS 460 (2006))).
Plaintiff timely filed an appeal of the MSPB's decision with the Office of Federal Operations of the EEOC. The EEOC affirmed the MSPB's conclusion that Plaintiff was not discriminated against within the meaning of applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies, as supported by the evidence [*4]  in the record as a whole. The EEOC then informed Plaintiff of his right to seek review of the decision in a district court by filing a civil action. Instead, Plaintiff submitted a petition for review to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, seeking review of the MSPB's decision. The Federal Circuit dismissed the petition for review as untimely. Since the Federal Circuit had no jurisdiction, it transferred Plaintiff's case to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631, due to the discrimination claim included in Plaintiff's MSPB case.
In its September 16, 2008 order denying Defendant's first Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 26), the Court held that Plaintiff sufficiently alleged, in his Amended Response (Doc. 25) to said Motion, specific discrimination claims under federal laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and Unfair Labor Practices, to survive dismissal for failure to state a claim.3 (Doc. 26). Notwithstanding this finding, the Court ordered the Plaintiff to recast his factual allegations from his Amended Response in separate numbered paragraphs in a formal complaint. (Id.) Specifically, the Court instructed Plaintiff to list [*5]  each claim against Defendant, along with the associated federal law that Plaintiff contends Defendant had violated, and file it with the Court by October 15, 2008. (Id.). Failure to do so by said date, warned the Court, would result in dismissal of Plaintiff's action. (Id.). On October 14, 2008, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in which he demanded a jury trial and listed each factual allegation as well as the relevant discrimination laws against Defendant in separate numbered paragraphs. (Doc. 27).
The Complaint in the instant case alleges, among other claims, that Defendant violated regulations promulgated under the Federal Employees Compensation Act ("FECA") by filing an injury notice and claim for compensation for Plaintiff with the Department of Labor two months after Plaintiff's one-the-job injury, and the Privacy Act of 1974 by unlawfully attending a first-step grievance meeting between Plaintiff and Plaintiff's union. (Id.). Plaintiff also claims that Defendant violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the ADA; the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA"); and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1991 by failing to accommodate Plaintiff's permanent arm and shoulder disability, [*6]  despite his repeated requests; requiring him to acquire new welding certifications that no other Department career welders had to obtain to maintain their employment with Defendant; and placing Plaintiff on administrative leave and ultimately terminating him when he could not perform the certification tests. (Id.).
Nearly a year after the Court denied Defendant's second Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 41), Defendant filed his Motion for Summary Judgment on July 29, 2011 (Doc. 54). Plaintiff responded on August 19, 20114 (Doc. 62), and Defendant filed his reply thereto August 29, 2011 (Doc. 63).5 Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is thus fully briefed and ripe for the Court's review.

FACTUAL SUMMARY
The following facts are derived from the Supplement to Complaint (Doc. 27); Answer (Doc. 28); Amended Answer (Doc. 51); Defendant's Statement of Material Facts to Which Defendant Contends There is No Genuine Issue to be Tried (Doc. 55) and Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Statement (Doc. 62),6 both of which were submitted pursuant to Local Rule 56;7 and the record in this case, including the excerpted administrative record (Doc. 59).8
Plaintiff began employment as a welder at the MCLB in Albany, Georgia, in 1997. (Doc. 55 ¶ 1). Plaintiff previously had been employed at McClellan Air Force Base in California, where he was required to maintain welding certifications every two years. (Id. ¶¶ 1, 2). Evolving welding certification standards required the passing of enumerated tests during the course of Plaintiff's employment at the MCLB; accordingly, after his arrival at MCLB, Plaintiff began to take certification tests pursuant to such requirements. (Id. ¶¶ 3, 4)
Approximately four years into his employment at the MCLB, on September 29, 2001, Plaintiff suffered an on-the-job shoulder injury. Plaintiff initially returned to work without limitations but on October 12, 2001, was given work restrictions of light duty with no pushing, pulling, or lifting more than ten pounds, for one to two weeks. (Doc. 62 ¶ 13(a)-(b) (citing Ex. B at 1-3)). These limitations applied through November 18, 2001. (Id. ¶ 13(c) (citing Ex. B at 7)). Following Plaintiff's arthroscopic surgery on his right rotator cuff on March 22, 2002, Dr. James Mason, Plaintiff's [*9]  treating physician, kept Plaintiff on light duty with no overhead use of his right arm, no excessive or repetitive lifting, and no lifting of more than ten pounds. (Id. ¶ 13(d) (e) (citing Ex. B at 15, 19-23)).
On June 23, 2002, those restrictions were modified to allow for lifting of up to twenty pounds for the next three months and continued with a modification of no climbing, imposed on September 12, 2002. (Id. ¶ 13(g) (citing Ex. B at 7)). On November 4, 2002, Plaintiff's work restrictions were "rescinded," except for the restriction on climbing, and on November 6, 2002, were modified to restrict heavy grinding and hammering. (Id. ¶ 13(h)-(i) (citing Ex. B at 28 29)). On January 3, 2003, Plaintiff's restrictions were again limited to no climbing. (Id. ¶ 13(j) (citing Ex. B at 30)).
Plaintiff's February 6, 2003 Functional Capacity Evaluation ("FCE") indicated that Plaintiff was able to function in the "heavy category for physical demand characteristics of work" but was not able to meet job requirements of frequently lifting 40-50 pounds and occasionally lifting up to 100 pounds. (Id. ¶ 13(k) (citing Ex. B at 31) (restricting Plaintiff to occasional exertion of 50 to 100 pounds of [*10]  force and/or frequent exertion of 25-50 pounds and/or constant exertion to move 10-20 pounds of force)). Based on complaints concerning his right shoulder presented to Dr. Mason on June 9, 2003, Plaintiff was assigned permanent work restrictions of no above-shoulder-height use of his right hand, along with no lifting of more than twenty-five pounds. (Id. ¶ 13(m)).
On July 23, 2003, Plaintiff's supervisors ordered Plaintiff to take and pass by September 30, 2003, welding certification tests WPS001, WPS003, WPS004, and WPS007, all of which he had previously failed;9 if he failed or refused to take the tests, he would be disqualified from his position. (Doc. 62-1 at 1; Doc. 62 ¶ 6; see also Doc. 55 ¶ 6). In response, Plaintiff allegedly asked one of his supervisors for an accommodation in the testing but was refused. (Doc. 62-1 at 1; see also Pl. Dep. 89:21-23). A July 22, 2003 email exchanged between Plaintiff's supervisors confirms that Plaintiff was informed that he would be removed from his position and transferred to another if he failed the tests. (Doc. 59-1 at 38). The email also indicates, however, that Plaintiff, in response, informed his supervisors that he would be able to complete [*11]  the tests. (Id.).
A few months later, on September 22, 2003, Plaintiff suffered another on-the-job injury, which led to the separation of his right arm from his shoulder. (Doc. 62 ¶ 7). As a result of the injury, on October 23, 2003, Dr. Mason kept Plaintiff on light duty with no use of his right arm. (Doc. 59 ¶ 13 (o)). Plaintiff's supervisors subsequently gave Plaintiff until January 26, 2004, to pass the welding certification tests (Doc. 55 ¶ 62), which, according to Defendant, he failed to do as to WPS003 and WPS004 (Id. ¶ 5).
Due to Plaintiff's failure to obtain the necessary welding certifications, Defendant issued Plaintiff a Notice of Contemplated Removal on February 24, 2004, for "failure to meet or maintain conditions of employment, in that [he] failed to obtain the necessary welding certifications required by [his] Welder, WG-3703-10, position . . . . " (Doc. 59-1 at 1). Plaintiff was then placed on a thirty-day administrative leave. (Id. at 3). On March 25, 2004, the Notice of Contemplated Removal was found to be supported, and Plaintiff was terminated, with removal effective on March 26, 2004. (Id. at 21).
On April 22, 2004, an arthroscopic labral repair and capsulorraphy surgery was performed [*12]  on Plaintiff to repair a large anterior labral tear ("SLAP") to his right shoulder. (Doc. 59 ¶ 13 (r)-(s)). On a May 3, 2004 office visit, Dr. Mason opined that Plaintiff could work on light duty in approximately four weeks, and on July 19, 2004, that Plaintiff could continue to work light duty without overheard use of his right arm, lifting of more than twenty pounds to waist height, repetitive lifting, or pushing or pulling with the right arm. (Doc. 62 ¶ 13(t)-(u)). On September 1, 2004, Dr. Mason found that Plaintiff would not be able to return to his welding job (Doc. 59 ¶ 13 (v)), and on December 15, 2004, revised Plaintiff's permanent partial disability rating to 8% and released Plaintiff from his care. (Doc. 59 ¶ 13 (w)). In the months thereafter, Dr. Mason expressed that Plaintiff could work an eight- to ten-hour day, with enumerated strenuous activities for no more than five hours. (Doc. 62 ¶ 13(y)).

DISCUSSION
In his Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant contends that he is entitled to summary judgment on several distinct grounds.10 First, he moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims based on Plaintiff's admission that he was unable to pass [*13]  the welding tests or perform his welding job, with or without reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 54 1 at 11). Thus, Defendant maintains that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's removal from his position—that is, Plaintiff's inability to obtain the required welding certifications. (Id.).
To the degree Plaintiff bases his Rehabilitation Act claim on Defendant's obligation to accommodate Plaintiff's alleged disability by reassigning him to another position, Defendant asserts that argument also fails. (Id.). Defendant reasons that the undisputed facts establish that Plaintiff has no disability, as the limitations and restrictions imposed on him did not substantially restrict a major life activity but only restricted his ability to perform tasks associated with his specific job. (Id. at 15 (citation omitted) (explaining that Plaintiff's physician opined that Plaintiff could be gainfully employed several ways, subject to elimination of strenuous activities)). Thus, Defendant's decision to terminate Plaintiff instead of reassign him to another position, says Defendant, could in no way have been based on Plaintiff's disability. (Id. at 13).
Third, Defendant argues that res judicata bars [*14]  Plaintiff's claims in this case since "a large part of Plaintiff's complaint . . . occupies itself with the same claims and complaints pertaining to the 2001 injury and its sequel" on which Plaintiff's 2004 case is based. (Id. at 16 to 17). Finally, Defendant contends that any other claims Plaintiff asserts fail because he has not exhausted the administrative process to file those claims in this Court. (Id. at 19).
In response, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has not met his burden of proof because he has failed to produce the actual results from the welding tests that Plaintiff allegedly failed. (Doc. 62-1 at 5, 9). Moreover, according to Plaintiff, management repeatedly ignored Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation requests for "job restructuring," an accommodation necessary since Plaintiff no longer fit the physical requirements of his welder position. (Id. at 14; see also Doc. 62 at ¶ 15). Plaintiff also disputes Defendant's assertion that Plaintiff is not disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, since the impairments to his arm and shoulder were permanent. (Doc. 62-1 at 12 to 13). Lastly, Plaintiff asserts that his case is not barred by res judicata because he did not have the opportunity to [*15]  exhaust all issues before the MSPB, particularly through presentation of testimony and evidence that he desired but was not permitted to present. (Id. at 15). The Court now evaluates each of the Parties' arguments in turn.

I. Summary Judgment Standards
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary judgment is proper "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). An issue is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Hoffman v. Allied Corp., 912 F.2d 1379, 1383 (11th Cir. 1990). A fact is "material" if it is a legal element of the claim under the applicable substantive law and it might affect the outcome of the nonmoving party's case. Allen v. Tyson Foods, 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A judgment is appropriate "as a matter of law" when the nonmoving party has failed to meet its burden of persuading the Court on an essential element of the claim. SeeCleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 804, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999); Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323.
The movant bears the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323. The movant can meet this burden by presenting evidence showing there is no dispute of material fact or by showing, [*16]  or by pointing out to, the district court that the nonmoving party has failed to present evidence in support of some element of its case on which it bears the ultimate burden of proof. Id. at 322-24. Once the movant has met its burden, the nonmoving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and identify "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Id. at 324. To avoid summary judgment, the nonmoving party must do more than summarily deny the allegations or "show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Rather, the nonmoving party must provide "enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party." Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251).
On a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view all the evidence and all factual inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine whether that evidence could reasonably sustain a jury verdict. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322-23; Allen, 121 F.3d at 646. However, the Court must grant summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).

II. Analysis
For reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims.

 [*17] a. FECA and Privacy Act Claims
Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's FECA and Privacy Act claims because they are barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The term "res judicata" can refer generally to the preclusive effect of earlier litigation. Brown v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 611 F.3d 1324, 1331-32 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 171 L. Ed. 2d 155 (2008)). It encompasses both claim preclusion, which "bars a subsequent action between the same parties on the same cause of action" and issue preclusion, which "operates more narrowly to prevent re-litigation of issues that have already been decided between the parties in an earlier lawsuit." Id. at 1332 (citations omitted). More specifically, claim preclusion, or traditional res judicata, which is most applicable here,
bars a litigant from raising claims that were raised or could have been raised in a prior action if: "(1) the prior decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) there was a final judgment on the merits; (3) the parties were identical in both suits; and (4) the prior and present causes of action are the same." For purposes of res judicata, the prior and present causes of action are the same if they arise "out of the same nucleus of operative fact, or are based upon the same factual predicate."
SeeDelVecchio v. I.R.S., 360 F. App'x 104, 109 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting [*18]  Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 326 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir. 2003)).
Here, Plaintiff's FECA claims in the instant action are barred by the Court's judgment in the 2004 case. Although FECA was not specifically raised in the 2004 action, it could have been. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 8101 et seq (protecting compensation coverage rights for federal civilian employees who are injured while in performance of duties). Many of the facts and claims on which the complaint in Case No. 1:04-cv-4 was based arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts or were based on the same factual predicate on which the instant Complaint is based—that is, Plaintiff's supervisors' improper management of his workers' compensation claim. Plaintiff complained in the 2004 case and now complains in the instant case that his immediate supervisor, Bobby Back, ignored his 2001 shoulder/arm injury, filed a misleading accident report with OWCP regarding said injury, and delayed the submission of the accident report to OWCP. Hence, the cause of action in the 2004 case and the present cause of action are the same.
All other elements of claim preclusion are satisfied as to Plaintiff's FECA claims in this case. This Court had jurisdiction over Plaintiff's 2004 civil action after the EEOC's dismissal and was therefore a [*19]  court of competent jurisdiction. This Court also rendered the previous June 22, 2005 order granting Defendant summary judgment in the 2004 case on the merits. Finally, the Parties in the 2004 suit and this suit—James Branscomb and the Secretary of the Department of the Navy—are identical. Thus, Plaintiff's FECA claims in the instant case are barred by res judicata.
The same finding of res judicata claim preclusion applies to Plaintiff's Privacy Act claims. The instant action and the 2004 action arise out of Plaintiff's supervisors' discussion and disclosure of Plaintiff's confidential medical records and thereby constitute the same cause of action. Plaintiff even attempted to adjudicate a Privacy Act claim in the 2004 case, on which the Court granted Defendant summary judgment. Moreover, the Privacy Act claim in the 2004 case was decided by this Court, a court of competent jurisdiction, on the merits and involved the same parties in this action. Accordingly, all elements for claim preclusion as to the Privacy Act claim in this case are also satisfied. Plaintiff's FECA and Privacy Act claims therefore both fail.

b. Title VII Claims
Title VII establishes that it is an "unlawful employment [*20]  practice" to discriminate against an employee on the basis of "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Plaintiff does not allege discrimination on any of these bases but instead, alleges discrimination based on disability under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. Thus, he has not invoked the protections of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Consequently, no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991.

c. CSRA Claims
The Court does not have jurisdiction over Plaintiff's CSRA claims as the CSRA "generally provides that final decisions of the MSPB are reviewable in either the courts of appeals or the Court of Claims." Doyal v. Marsh, 777 F.2d 1526, 1535 (11th Cir. 1985) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 7703(b)(1); 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16(c)). The only exception to this is if the employee has also alleged a basis of discrimination under Title VII, in which case the CSRA case is reviewable by a district court de novo. Id. Because this Court is a federal district court and not an appellate court or the Court of Claims, and because Plaintiff does not allege claims of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex discrimination under Title VII, as earlier noted, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff's [*21]  CSRA claims.

d. Rehabilitation Act and ADA Claims
Both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit employers from discriminating against disabled persons. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, 12112(a) (ADA); 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Rehabilitation Act). Accordingly, discrimination claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the same standards; the Eleventh Circuit even relies on cases interchangeably construing the ADA with the Rehabilitation Act. Wilson v. School Bd. of Seminole County, Fla., 610 F.3d 588, 604 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Allmond v. Akal Sec., Inc., 558 F.3d 1312, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2009)).
To analyze an ADA claim, as well as a Rehabilitation Act claim, a court, "[u]nder the controlling law in this Circuit, [must apply] 'the burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims . . . .'" Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Accordingly, "[t]o establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) she is disabled; (2) she is a qualified individual; and (3) she was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of [her] disability." Jones v. STOA Int'l/Fla., Inc., 422 F. App'x 851, 852 (11th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). Defendant disputes Plaintiff's ability to satisfy the first and second element of his prima facie case—that is, whether Plaintiff is disabled and whether he was a "qualified individual." The Court first addresses the latter element of "qualified individual."
A "qualified individual" is [*22]  "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) (emphases added).
"[E]ssential functions 'are the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform.'" If the particular function is essential, an ADA plaintiff must show that he can perform it either without accommodation or with a "reasonable accommodation." An accommodation is reasonable only if it enables the individual to perform the essential functions of the job. Though the ADA may require an employer to alter or eliminate marginal job functions, it does not require an employer to eliminate essential job functions.
Cremeens v. City of Montgomery, Ala., 427 Fed. Appx. 855, 2011 WL 2149918, *1 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). A failure by an employer to make reasonable accommodations for an employee who otherwise qualifies as "disabled" constitutes discrimination under the ADA. D'Angelo v. Conagra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1225 (11th Cir. 2005); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("'[D]iscriminate . . . ' includes not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee . . . .").
An employer may reasonably accommodate an ADA "qualified [*23]  individual" by, for example, making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; reassignment to a vacant position; acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; or other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(A)-(B); see also 29 C.F.R § 1630.2(o)(1)(i) ("The term reasonable accommodation means: . . . Modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position . . . .").
In the instant case, the evidence submitted by both Parties establishes that failure to pass the welder certification tests would result in disqualification for the WG-3703-10 welder position. (See Doc. 59 at 7). The Parties also represent in their briefs that Plaintiff's inability to pass the tests inhibited his ability to perform the duties of his job. For example, Plaintiff admits that he could not function in that position not only because of his inability to take and pass the tests but because of his [*24]  inability to perform the duties of his particular welder position. Thus, there is no dispute between the Parties as to whether the welder tests, as well as full use of both arms, were essential to Plaintiff's welder position. (See Pl. Dep. 85:12-20, 89:13-15, 97:5-8 ("Q. So what of those 003, 004, or 007, what of those tests do you contend you couldn't do because of those [restrictions] . . . ? A. Anything after my '03 injury would have been impossible for me to do. I was completely incapable of doing it. . . . I contend that I was terminated because I . . . absolutely could not perform what they were requiring me to perform with my injury. . . . I was physically incapable to do the job [and] to do the tests. ")).
Moreover, Plaintiff has expressly testified that he could not perform these essential functions of his welder position with or without reasonable accommodation. (Id. at 96:19-97:5 ("Q. . . . [Y]ou [have] admitted . . . that you are not able to perform the work entailed in the welding job with or without accommodations? A. Exactly. My right arm was separated. . . . I was physically incapable.")). Thus, the inquiry into Plaintiff's prima facie case should end here, since it [*25]  is undisputed that Plaintiff could not perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential duties of his specific welder position—namely, passage of the welder certification tests. SeeD'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1225 (citation omitted) ("If the individual 'is unable to perform an essential function of his . . . job, even with an accommodation, he is, by definition, not a 'qualified individual' and, therefore, not covered under the ADA.'").
Although Plaintiff has raised the possibility of transfer to a security guard position as a reasonable accommodation (see Doc. 62 at ¶ 15), he has not established that such a position existed and was vacant. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B) (providing that reasonable accommodation under ADA may include transfer or reassignment to vacant position). Any other reasonable accommodations that Plaintiff claims he requested of Defendant were not sufficiently specific, as presented in the record, to sustain Plaintiff's prima facie burden. SeeGaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363, 1364 (11th Cir. 1999) (explaining plaintiff's responsibility to inform employer of need for specific accommodation and that failure to demand specific accommodation is fatal to ADA discrimination claim). For example, Plaintiff repeatedly contends that he was entitled to an accommodation [*26]  in the form of alternative employment that would fit his physical limitations. Yet, aside from the security guard position, he names no specific accommodations of alternative positions in which he expressed interest. (See, e.g., Doc. 62 ¶ 15; see also Pl. Dep. 97:24-25, 106:19-22, 108:10-21 ("I repeatedly asked for reasonable accommodations. . . . [They were supposed to accommodate me w]hen they were notified on June the 9th, 2003 of my permanent physical disability to immediately begin the accommodation process. . . . They never accommodated me. . . . [T]hey were required by law to do so.")).
The Court further finds that even if Plaintiff were a qualified individual, he still would be unable to establish his prima facie case because he was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. The ADA defines disability as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Plaintiff appears to contend that his medical condition falls under the first definition.
"Major life activities" include caring for oneself, [*27]  performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, concentrating, and working, among other tasks. Id. § 12102(2). "Substantially limits" indicates that the individual is unable to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). "In determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity, . . . the nature and severity of the impairment; the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and the permanent or long-term impact, or the expected permanent or long-term impact of or resulting from the impairment" should be considered. Blundell v. Health Care Auth. of City of Huntsville, 140 F. App'x 154, 154, 155-56 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).
Since Plaintiff has not explained in his briefs or pleadings whether or how his daily activities have been restricted in life generally, the Court finds that Plaintiff only claims that his medical condition with respect to his right arm and shoulder only interfered with the major life activity of work as a welder. (See Pl. Dep. 111:19-112:1). When the major life activity under consideration is that of working, the statutory phrase "substantially limits" requires, at a minimum, that the plaintiff alleges that he is unable to work in a "broad [*28]  class of jobs"—meaning he is unable to perform not only the job from which he was disqualified but other jobs in the geographic area that utilize "similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities" as the job from which he was disqualified due to the impairment. Blundell, 140 F. App'x at 156 (noting that inability to perform particular job does not constitute substantial limitation in major life activity of working). Thus, a person is not disabled merely because he is unable to do one particular job for an employer; there must be a limitation of his ability to work in general. Freund v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., Inc., 930 F. Supp. 613, 617 (S.D. Ga. 1996).
Here, Plaintiff has failed to introduce evidence to support his claim that his arm and shoulder condition prevents him from performing a broad class of jobs; the record is void of any such evidence. Plaintiff was restricted in his physical limitations, off and on, from September 2001 until his termination in March 2004 and a few months thereafter in grinding, overhead work, hammering, pushing, climbing, pulling, or lifting more than a certain amount of weight. However, "a diminished activity tolerance for normal daily activities such as lifting, running and performing manual tasks, as well as a lifting restriction, does not constitute a [*29]  disability under the ADA." Blundell, 140 F. App'x at 155-56 (emphases added) (quoting Chanda v. Engelhard/ICC, 234 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir. 2000).
And by no means were Plaintiff's impairments permanent or severe for an extended period of time. Physical therapy, Plaintiff's March 2002 and April 2004 surgeries, and simply the passage of time to heal corrected Plaintiff's injuries or at least moderately ameliorated any limitations they caused. To illustrate, this is evidenced by the fact that Dr. Mason gradually raised the amount that Plaintiff could lift.
Moreover, a few months after Plaintiff's September 2001 injury, a February 2003 FCE even indicated that Plaintiff could perform in the "heavy category for physical demand characteristics of work," and based on a 2005 FCE, Dr. Mason found that Plaintiff could work a full work day with limited strenuous activities. It also must be noted that Plaintiff's injury was only to his right shoulder and arm, of which he had some limited use in addition to the use of his other extremities. Thus, these limitations in Plaintiff's use of his right arm and shoulder are not sufficiently substantial, prolonged, or permanent to constitute a disability.
Also, the activities of lifting and repetitive work with hands extended above the shoulder and [*30]  head, the most frequent restrictions imposed on Plaintiff, are more closely associated with Plaintiff's former welder position than with the tasks of everyday life. Thus, Plaintiff has not otherwise established that he is unable to perform the variety of tasks central to most people's lives such as cooking and cleaning, driving, and taking care of himself. See, e.g., Carr v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., No. 3:03-CV-118 (CDL), 2005 WL 1073253, *7 (M.D. Ga. Apr. 4, 2005) (noting that no substantial limitation on major life activity exists where, for example, ADA plaintiff with arm injury could attend to basic activities of daily living, although she was restricted from heavy lifting and repetitive rotational movements, "had difficulty picking up little things," and could not "hold things up high or real tight for long periods of time" at work).
Lastly, while the injuries to Plaintiff's right shoulder and arm prevented Plaintiff from performing the duties of his specific job, they were not so severe that Plaintiff could not have performed other jobs at MCLB—even those of welder of a different grade. The welding certifications that Plaintiff was required to obtain were only for his specific welding position; neither Plaintiff nor the record [*31]  indicates that this was a requirement for all welding positions. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to establish as part of his prima facie case that his impairments to his right arm and shoulder interfered with his ability to perform the major life activity of working in a broad class of jobs.
For all of the above reasons, the Court holds that Plaintiff was not disabled during his employment with the Department and that Defendant therefore had no duty to accommodate Plaintiff within the meaning of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. Thus, no genuine issues of material fact remain as to Plaintiff's ADA or Rehabilitation Act claims, nor do they remain as to Plaintiff's claims under the FECA, CSRA, Privacy Act, or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or 1991. The Court therefore GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 54) as to all of Plaintiff's claims against Defendant.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 54) is GRANTED. It is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff shall take nothing by his Complaint (Doc. 27), and JUDGMENT shall be entered in favor of Defendant.
SO ORDERED, this 29th day of September 2011.
/s/ W. Louis Sand
THE [*32]  HONORABLE W. LOUIS SANDS,
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
