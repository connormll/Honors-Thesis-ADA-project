REPORT & RECOMMENDATION

Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 94)
I. INTRODUCTION
In this employment discrimination and failure-to-accommodate case, Plaintiff moves for partial summary judgment, arguing that the Rehabilitation Act required her employer to continue her eligibility for situational telework as a reasonable accommodation following an organizational realignment and recoding of her position to be ineligible for telework. Defendant disputes that Plaintiff had been given a reasonable accommodation. Defendant further argues that Plaintiff has not established that she could perform the essential functions of her position, with or without a reasonable accommodation, such that she is a "qualified individual" under the Rehabilitation Act. Because Plaintiff, as the movant, has not established that she previously had a reasonable accommodation, her argument that Defendant failed [*2]  to continue it fails. Because she does not argue in her Brief in Support that she is entitled to summary judgment on any basis other than the failure-to-continue theory, I recommend that Plaintiff's Partial Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 94) be DENIED.
II. BACKGROUND
On March 23, 2016, Lisa M. Davenport ("Plaintiff") commenced this action against defendant Secretary of the Department of the Navy, who is now Carlos Del Toro ("Defendant"),2 after she was removed from her position as Supervisory Security Specialist at the Navy Depot in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. The case is proceeding on a Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 63), which alleges claims of disability and gender discrimination and failure to accommodate.
The Court previously dismissed Count I of Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (Doc. 11), which was an appeal from the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB") affirming the decision of the Administrative Judge ("AJ") that the Navy properly removed Plaintiff from her position due to physical inability to perform her job and denying her affirmative defense of failure to accommodate. (See Docs. 42 & 43). The First Amended Complaint also contained Count II disability [*3]  and gender discrimination claims. The Amended Complaint presented a "mixed case," as it combined a civil service claim with a federal discrimination claim. See 5 U.S.C. § 7703. The Court granted a motion to sever the MSPB appeal (Count I) and the federal antidiscrimination claims (Count II). (See Docs. 30 & 31). The Court then ruled on Count I only, affirming the decision of the MSPB. (See Doc. 42). Plaintiff's discrimination and failure-to-accommodate claims continued.
Before the Court now is a Partial Motion for Summary Judgment by Plaintiff as to her failure-to-accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act. (Doc. 94). Plaintiff filed a Brief in Support (Doc. 95) and a Statement of Material Fact (Doc. 94-1), Defendant filed a Brief in Opposition (Doc. 97) and a Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts (Doc. 98), and Plaintiff filed a Reply Brief (Doc. 99). This matter is ripe for resolution.
III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides as follows:
A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any [*4]  material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court should state on the record the reasons for granting or denying the motion.
A fact is material if proof of its existence or nonexistence might affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable substantive law. Haybarger v. Laurence Cnty. Adult Prob. & Parole, 667 F.3d 408, 412 (3d Cir. 2012)). For an issue to be genuine, "all that is required is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial." Id. (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248-49).
The Court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). A court is not to decide whether the evidence unquestionably favors one side or the other, or to make credibility determinations, but instead must decide whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party on the evidence presented. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1363.
IV. UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS
The following facts are based on Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts (Doc. 94-1), Defendant's Response thereto (Doc. 98), in which it admits or admits with clarification all statements, [*5]  and the parties' exhibits, viewed in the light most favorable to Defendant as the non-moving party. Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed.
A. Plaintiff'S Employment With Defendant
On August 28, 2011, Plaintiff was promoted to the position of Supervisory Security Specialist with Defendant Department of the Navy. (Doc. 79, Answer to Second Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 9, 15). Plaintiff received a personnel form known as a SF-50 indicating the promotion. Id. Her position of Supervisory Security Specialist was within the Security Office, which was part of Weapons Support Systems ("WSS"). Id. The WSS was a component of the Navy and a "tenant activity" at what is commonly known as the Mechanicsburg Navy Depot. Id. The Naval Support Activity ("NSA") Mechanicsburg was the Base Command responsible for operating the Mechanicsburg Navy Depot. Id. at ¶ 6. At all times relevant to this action, both WSS and NSA were subcomponents of the Navy, both located and operating out of the Mechanicsburg Navy Depot. (Doc. 94-1, ¶ 1).
While Plaintiff served as Supervisory Security Specialist in the Security Office under WSS, her then-supervisor, WSS Security Director Michael Zynski, coded her position [*6]  as eligible for situational telework. (Doc. 79, ¶ 44). The parties dispute whether this eligibility was due to the telework policies for her position at that time or as a reasonable accommodation for her medical conditions, which include occasional flareups of disabling Lyme disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia.
On December 19, 2011, Zynski notified Plaintiff by email that "WSS Management [had] determined that she was eligible for situational telework only." Id. at ¶¶ 14 and 21.
B. Realignment Of Functions At Mechanicsburg Navy Depot
In October 2012, certain functions at the Mechanicsburg Navy Depot, including the Security Office, were "realigned" administratively from WSS to Navy Region Mid-Atlantic, NSA Mechanicsburg. (Doc. 79, ¶¶ 8, 31). On October 7, 2012 Plaintiff received another SF-50 personnel form "realigning" her administratively from WSS Mechanicsburg to NSA Mechanicsburg. Id. at ¶¶ 9, 32. Plaintiff's essential functions as a Supervisory Security Specialist, as articulated in Agency Position No. AA659, did not change as a result of the realignment. Id. at ¶ 33. Her employer, or "Agency," remained the Department of the Navy. As part of her position, both before [*7]  and after the realignment, Plaintiff did not carry a gun or perform actual, day to day, police or fire duties. Id. at ¶ 11.
C. Plaintiff'S January 1, 2013 Telework Request
On January 1, 2013, Plaintiff submitted a request to telework, pursuant to her prior eligibility for situational telework. Id. at, ¶¶ 35, 36. On January 7, 2013, she emailed her chain of command, requesting reasonable accommodations based on her medical conditions of Lyme disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia. (Doc. 93-1, pp. 30-31). On January 11, 2013, Plaintiff submitted DD Form 2946, a Telework Agreement, requesting situational telework from January 13, 2013 to January 12, 2014. Id. at p. 36.
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's position of Supervisory Security Specialist had been recoded after the realignment to be ineligible for telework, consistent with the fifteen (15) other Supervisory Security Specialist positions within Navy Region Mid-Atlantic, and that the error in the coding of Plaintiff's particular position was discovered during the review of her telework request at Navy Region Mid-Atlantic after January 1, 2013. (See Doc. 79, ¶ 44; Doc. 98, ¶ 10).
On March 1, 2013, Plaintiff was issued a [*8]  letter denying her request for reasonable accommodations. (Doc. 79, ¶ 41). The letter stated that "there is no accommodation which can be provided that will enable you to perform the essential functions of your job or any other available position within the command." Id.
Between March 1, 2013 and August 26, 2013, Plaintiff did not return to work. Id. at 79, ¶ 46. Her doctors provided several letters to Defendant during that period regarding her medical conditions and stating she wanted to return to work as soon as possible. (See Doc. 93-1, pp. 33, 48, 55, 71). A medical certification from one of her doctors dated April 30, 2013 stated Plaintiff was not "able to perform work of any kind." Id. at p. 65.
D. Plaintiff'S Removal
On August 26, 2013, Plaintiff received a Notice of Proposed Removal, based on a charge of "Inability to Perform as a Result of a Medical Condition." (Doc. 79, ¶ 51).
The Notice of Proposed Removal stated, in pertinent part,
The medical evidence that you provided shows that you have permanent medical conditions. Because of these medical conditions, you have not been able to work or fulfill the requirements of your position since 1 March 2013. Your position is one that [*9]  needs to be filled and this action will promote the efficiency of the service.
(Docs. 63, ¶ 52; 79, ¶ 52).
Plaintiff's attorney responded to the Notice of Proposed Removal in writing. On September 20, 2013 the Navy issued a Notice of Decision, removing Plaintiff from her position as Supervisory Security Specialist effective September 27, 2013. (Doc. 63, ¶ 53; Doc. 79, ¶ 53).
Plaintiff's Supervisory Security Specialist position remained unfilled from September 27, 2013 to January 27, 2014, after which a Program Analyst was detailed to Plaintiff's position. (Doc. 79, ¶¶ 63, 65). From March 1, 2013 to January 27, 2014, Plaintiff's duties had been performed by several managers. Id. at ¶ 62.
E. Administrative Proceedings
Plaintiff filed a mixed case appeal to the MSPB challenging the decision removing her from employment with the Navy and alleging that its denial of her request to use telework on an "as needed" basis constituted failures to accommodate her medical conditions of Lyme disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia. The MSPB sustained Plaintiff's removal, and this appeal and Complaint followed.
V. DISCUSSION
In the present Motion, Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on only her [*10]  failure-to-accommodate claims under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 791 et seq. In reviewing these claims, this Court is not bound by issues resolved in Plaintiff's administrative proceedings:
We hold that, when a federal employee comes to court to challenge, in whole or in part, the administrative disposition of his or her discrimination claims, the court must consider those claims de novo, and is not bound by the results of the administrative process, whether that process culminated in one administrative decision, or in two or more decisions.
Morris v. Rumsfeld, 420 F.3d 287, 294 (3d Cir. 2005) (discussing Title VII claims and analyzing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(c)); see also Stone v. Johnson, 608 F. App'x 126, 128 (3d Cir. 2015) ("[A] federal employee unhappy with the administrative decision may bring his or her claims to a district court, under Section 505(a) of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a), and receive the same de novo consideration that a private sector employee enjoys in a Title VII action[.]"). Defendant does not challenge use of this standard. (Doc. 97, p. 14 n.5).
A. Legal Standard For Reasonable Accommodations Under The Rehabilitation Act
The Rehabilitation Act prohibits federal employers from discriminating against persons with disabilities, including by failing to provide reasonable accommodations. See Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827, 831 (3d Cir. 1996); Muhammad v. Ct. of Common Pleas of Allegheny Cty., Pa., 483 F. App'x 759, 763 (3d Cir. 2012). Claims under the Rehabilitation Act are subject to the [*11]  requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Muhammad, 483 F. App'x at 763.
Under the RA, "a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) she was denied the benefits of a program or activity of a public entity which receives federal funds; and (3) she was discriminated against based on her disability." Reed v. Schuylkill Health Sys., No. 3:CV-13-1175, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172907, 2013 WL 6479127, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Dec. 9, 2013) (quoting Calloway v. Boro of Glassboro Dep't of Police, 89 F.Supp.2d 543, 551 (D.N.J.2000)). Discrimination on the basis of ability includes—
not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity[.]
42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). A plaintiff making a failure to accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act "must show that the accommodation [s]he seeks is reasonable, . . . i.e., that it is 'necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.'" Id. at pp. 763-64 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)).
A "qualified individual" is—
an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's [*12]  judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C.A. § 12111(8).
B. Failure To Continue A Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiff argues that she is entitled to summary judgment on her reasonable accommodations claim because Defendant removed her accommodation of situational telework merely because of an organizational realignment, which involved no changes in her job requirements. (See Doc. 95, pp. 9-103 ). She argues,
In 2013, when Plaintiff Davenport was removed from her employment, there were no cases on point involving an employer's obligation to continue a reasonable accommodation after a realignment or the equivalent of a realignment. In the years that have passed since Plaintiff Davenport was removed from employment, we now have several cases that have addressed the issue and they all support Plaintiff's argument that there is a duty on the employer to continue an accommodation after a realignment.
(Doc. 95, p. 10).
Plaintiff asserts that the eligibility for situational telework she was granted in December [*13]  2011 was specifically granted as a reasonable accommodation:
Davenport has intermittently disabling medical conditions including Lyme disease, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. ([Doc. 94-1, ¶] 9) To help Davenport work and deal with those sometimes-disabling medical condi[t]ions, the Navy provided her with "situational" telework as a reasonable accommodation, i.e, she could telework whenever she was having a flareup of her medical conditions. ([Doc. 94-1, ¶¶] 9, 10).
(Doc. 95, p. 15).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not proved that WSS made her eligible for situational telework in 2011 as a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 97, p. 11). In reply, Plaintiff argues Defendant has waived this argument. I first address the issue of waiver, then Plaintiff's argument that Defendant's revocation of her eligibility for situational telework constituted a failure to provide reasonable accommodations.

1. Waiver
Plaintiff argues that Defendant raises for the first time, seven years into her legal proceedings, the argument that her original eligibility for situational telework was made pursuant to a Telework Policy and not as a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 99, p. 3). She argues that this [*14]  constitutes waiver, because affirmative defenses must be raised in response to a pleading, otherwise the affirmative defense is waived. She further argues that, unless discovery is reopened, "we are left only with speculation as to which policy (telework or reasonable accommodation) was used by WSS" in providing her original eligibility for situational telework. Id. at pp. 4-5. She further argues, even if discovery were reopened, the needed records and witnesses, such as her prior supervisor, are no longer available. Id. at p. 5.
Plaintiff overlooks that affirmative defenses are not the same as general defenses. See Elliott & Frantz, Inc. v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 457 F.3d 312, 321 (3d Cir. 2006). Rather, "a general defense, unlike an affirmative defense, challenges whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case." Id. (citing In re Rawson Food Serv., Inc., 846 F.2d 1343, 1349 (11th Cir.1988)). Here, Defendant's argument is that Plaintiff cannot establish an element of her Rehabilitation Act claim of failure to continue a reasonable accommodation, as she was never provided such an accommodation. (Doc. 97, p. 11). This is not an affirmative defense. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c). Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant waived the argument that Plaintiff's original eligibility for situational telework was not a reasonable accommodation. I therefore [*15]  consider Defendant's argument. The question of whether discovery should be reopened based on this disputed issue is a question for another day.

2. Plaintiff's Situational Telework as a Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiff asserts that caselaw developed since her removal from her position establishes that the discontinuation of a reasonable accommodation, absent a change in circumstances, is impermissible under the Rehabilitation Act or ADA. (Doc. 95, pp. 10-14; Doc. 99). In support, Plaintiff cites to Isbell v. John Crane, Inc., 30 F. Supp. 3d 725 (N.D. Ill. 2014); Sandor v. Delmont Borough, 92 F. Supp. 3d 355 (W.D. Pa. 2015); and Bilinsky v. American Airlines, 928 F.3d 565 (7th Cir. 2019). In these cases, however, the existence of a reasonable accommodation was not clearly disputed, as it is here.
In Isbell, although the parties disputed whether the plaintiff's modified start time constituted a "reasonable accommodation," they did not dispute that the plaintiff had a disability of which her employer was aware in agreeing to the modified start time. 30 F. Supp. 3d at 733. The record showed that several months after the plaintiff's manager agreed to the modified start time, he asked the plaintiff for a note from her doctor to support the later start time, which the plaintiff provided. Id. at 730. The plaintiff was then permitted to continue arriving at the modified start time for more than a year, [*16]  until a new supervisor took over and the manager instituted new, uniform work hours and required the plaintiff to follow them. Id. The court considered the modified start time to have been a reasonable accommodation and granted summary judgment for the plaintiff, denying the defendant's cross motion for summary judgement. Id. at 735-36.
Sandor was decided at the motion to dismiss stage, and the plaintiff had specifically alleged that his employer withdrew a reasonable accommodation that had been working. 92 F. Supp. 3d at 356, 358 & n.1.
Lastly, Bilinsky involved a plaintiff with a "work from home agreement" with her employer due to her multiple sclerosis. 928 F.3d at 567. The employer acknowledged that the plaintiff had been able to perform the essential functions of her job with that reasonable accommodation for several years, prior to a new supervisor taking over and withdrawing the accommodation. Id. at 571.
Here, in contrast, Defendant disputes that Plaintiff's eligibility for situational telework was provided as a reasonable accommodation. In support of her contention that her eligibility for situational telework was granted in December 2011 as a reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff cites to her Statement of Material Facts. (Doc. 94-1, ¶¶ 9-11). [*17]  The relevant paragraphs of her Statement of Material Facts cite to paragraphs 14, 21, and 44 of Defendant's Answer to the Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 79). See id. Those paragraphs of the Answer respond to allegations that the telework was provided as a reasonable accommodation. While Defendant agrees that Plaintiff was determined to be eligible for situational telework, Defendant denies the portions of the allegations that assert that Plaintiff's eligibility for telework was granted as a reasonable accommodation for any medical conditions. (See Doc. 79, ¶¶ 15, 21, 44). Defendant admitted that one of Plaintiff's coworkers in the Security Office had also been determined to be eligible for situational telework before the realignment of the Security Office. Id. at ¶¶ 23-24.
Plaintiff also alleges in her Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 63) that she talked with various individuals employed by NSA about her medical conditions before the realignment, as part of the promotion process for her appointment to Supervisory Security Specialist. (See Doc. 63, ¶¶ 27-30). Defendant denied these allegations in its answer. (Doc. 79, ¶¶ 27-30). Plaintiff has not directed the Court to any place in the [*18]  record that supports her contention that Defendant knew of her medical conditions and any requested accommodations before the realignment.
Plaintiff has set forth persuasive authority for the proposition that an employer violates the Rehabilitation Act or ADA by withdrawing a previously granted reasonable accommodation, absent a change in circumstances (which does not include a mere change in management). However, Plaintiff has not carried her burden as the moving party to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of a reasonable accommodation prior to the realignment, including any knowledge Defendant had of her medical conditions at that time.4 Plaintiff may be able to prove the existence of such an accommodation, but she has not done so for purposes of her Motion for Summary Judgment.5
C. Failure To Provide A Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiff bases her Motion for Summary Judgment on her above-addressed argument that the change in telework policy after the realignment, and Defendant's denial of her January 2013 telework request based on that changed policy, constituted an impermissible failure to continue a reasonable accommodation. [*19] 
Plaintiff does not argue in her Brief in Support that she is entitled to summary judgment on her Rehabilitation Act claim on any other basis, such as that Defendant's failure to approve her January 2013 telework request was an independent failure to accommodate. (See Doc. 95). To do so, she would need to establish, which she has not, that there is no genuine dispute that she is "qualified individual," see 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A), such that she could have performed the essential functions of her position with or without a reasonable accommodation, see 42 U.S.C.A. § 12111(8).
In her Reply Brief, Plaintiff does address the reasonableness of her January 2013 request for accommodations and whether she was a "qualified individual." (Doc. 99). However, the Court need not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. See United States v. Martin, 454 F. Supp. 2d 278, 281 n.3 (E.D.Pa.2006) (collecting cases); Elizabethtown Water Co. v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., 998 F. Supp. 447, 458 (D.N.J.1998); Matthews v. Runco's Tavern & Grill, Inc, No. 3:10-CV-01215, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163169, 2013 WL 6055219, at *2 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 15, 2013). Moreover, I also note that Plaintiff described several of the factual issues related to her January 2013 telework request and ability to perform her job functions as matters that a jury could reasonably find in her favor. (See Doc. 99, pp. 8, 10, 14-15). But for Plaintiff to be entitled to summary judgment, she must establish that there [*20]  is no genuine dispute of material fact, not simply that a jury could find facts to support her claims. That a reasonable jury could find in her favor might prevent summary judgment from being granted against Plaintiff, but it is not enough to entitle Plaintiff to summary judgment as the moving party.
VI. RECOMMENDATION

1. Plaintiff's Partial Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 94) be DENIED.
