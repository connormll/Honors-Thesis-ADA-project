Opinion



MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
This matter comes before the Court on Defendant County of Fairfax, Virginia's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. Dkt. 8. Considering the Motion together with Defendant's Memorandum in Support (Dkt. 9); Plaintiff Jonate Williams's Opposition (Dkt. 12); and Defendant's Reply (Dkt. 13), the Court grants the Motion in part and denies the Motion in part for the reasons that follow.
I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Jonate Williams alleges that her employer, Defendant Fairfax County, has discriminated against her on the basis of her race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and her disability in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"). Dkt. 7 ¶¶ 24-31. She [*2]  also alleges Defendant retaliated against her for complaining of race discrimination in violation of Title VII. Id. 32-33. This Court accepts all facts alleged within the Amended Complaint as true, as it must at the motion-to-dismiss stage. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).
Plaintiff has been employed by Defendant since October of 2008 as a public safety communications professional. Dkt. 7 ¶ 7. Her supervisor, James Heflin, is a white man. Id. Plaintiff is an African American woman who suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2014. Id. ¶ 8. The cognitive impairment resulting from this injury causes her difficulty with focus, concentration, and memory. Id. In addition, Plaintiff fell in the office parking lot where she works on January 16, 2019. Id. ¶ 9. She injured her hands, wrists, arms, and legs and also suffered torn ligaments. Id.
Plaintiff returned to work in October of 2019, at which time her doctor requested an ergonomic assessment of her work station. Id. ¶ 12. Defendant hired contractors to perform the requested ergonomic assessment, who evaluated Plaintiff's work station before the end of the calendar year and advised Defendant of their recommendations. Id. Those recommendations included that Plaintiff be [*3]  allowed to use an ergonomic chair, a vertical mouse, and an ergonomic keyboard. Id. ¶ 14. Since she resumed working full time on February 3, 2020, Plaintiff has experienced significant pain in her arms, wrists, and hands. Id. ¶ 9. Her employer has allowed her to use an ergonomic chair, but has not permitted her to use a vertical mouse or ergonomic keyboard. Id. ¶ 14.
Plaintiff has spoken out about perceived disparate treatment toward minority employees in her workplace on at least two occasions. Heflin, Plaintiff's supervisor, sent a notice to employees on June 2, 2020 stating that anyone who missed work would need to submit a doctor's note, which Plaintiff alleges is not required by Fairfax County rules. Id. ¶ 18. Heflin sent this note the day after mass protests were scheduled nationwide and locally in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Id. The next day, on June 3, 2020, Plaintiff addressed the requirement at a roll call meeting, stating that Heflin's note was "directed towards black and brown employees" and targeted "people who look like me." Id.
On September 2, 2020, Plaintiff again voiced her opinions on racial discrimination in her workplace. Id. [*4]  ¶ 20. At a diversity and inclusion meeting that day, Plaintiff stated publicly that African American employees received closer scrutiny than did white employees, were not given the benefit of the doubt, were expected to be 100%, and that they—like all employees—"wanted to be able to tell their boss that they are not well without being accused of lying about being sick" or of being incompetent. Id. Plaintiff also aired her frustration that while white employees are given opportunities to attend trainings and certifications, her requests to participate in those same professional development opportunities are "brushed aside and denied." Id. More than twenty employees, including Heflin and several other supervisors, attended this meeting and heard Plaintiff's complaints. Id.
Three weeks after this diversity and inclusion meeting, Heflin proposed Plaintiff for a one-day, unpaid suspension, which her employer then imposed. Id. ¶ 21. She contends this suspension was retaliation for her decision to express her objections to discriminatory treatment in the workplace. Id. After Plaintiff arrived late to work and left early on December 12, 2020, she was again designated for an unpaid suspension, [*5]  this time for three days. Id. ¶ 22. Plaintiff alleges she was unwell that day because she experienced a reaction to her medications, but her suspension was upheld. Id. On December 28, 2020, Plaintiff filed a discrimination complaint with the Fairfax County Office of Human Rights and Equity Programs. Id. ¶ 23.
Then, on May 1, 2021, Plaintiff filed suit in this Court. Dkt. 1. She submitted an Amended Complaint as of right on June 30, 2021, asserting two claims alleging violations of the ADA and two claims alleging violations of Title VII. Dkt. 7. Defendant then moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint. Dkt. 8. Plaintiff opposed that motion (Dkt. 12), and Defendant submitted a reply in support of its motion to dismiss. Dkt. 13.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the sufficiency of a complaint. Brockington v. Boykins, 637 F.3d 503, 506 (4th Cir. 2011). "[T]he reviewing court must determine whether the complaint alleges sufficient facts 'to raise a right to relief above the speculative level[,]'" and dismissal is appropriate only if the well-pleaded facts in the complaint "state a claim that is plausible on its face.'" Goldfarb v. Mayor & City Council of Baltimore, 791 F.3d 500, 508 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible "when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable [*6]  inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).
At the motion-to-dismiss stage, a plaintiff need only "allege facts sufficient to state all the elements of her claim," Bass v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 324 F.3d 761, 765 (4th Cir. 2003), and "the district court must 'accept as true all well-pled facts in the complaint and construe them in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff].'" Dao v. Faustin, 402 F. Supp. 3d 308, 315 (E.D. Va. 2019) (quoting United States v. Triple Canopy, Inc., 775 F.3d 628, 632 n.1 (4th Cir. 2015)). Still, "[c]onclusory allegations regarding the legal effect of the facts alleged" need not be accepted. Labram v. Havel, 43 F.3d 918, 921 (4th Cir. 1995); see also E. Shore Mkts., Inc. v. J.D. Assoc. Ltd. P'ship, 213 F.3d 175, 180 (4th Cir. 2000) ("[W]hile we must take the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we need not accept the legal conclusions drawn from the facts . . . Similarly, we need not accept as true unwarranted inferences, unreasonable conclusions, or arguments."). And "[g]enerally, courts may not look beyond the four corners of the complaint in evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion." Linlor v. Polson, 263 F. Supp. 3d 613, 618 (E.D. Va. 2017) (citing Goldfarb, 791 F.3d at 508).
III. ANALYSIS
Defendant attached to its brief an exhibit—a charge of discrimination Plaintiff filed with the Fairfax County Office of Human Rights and Equity Programs. See Dkt. 9-1. Defendant argues that the Court should include this exhibit in its analysis of the Motion to Dismiss as Plaintiff has incorporated it by reference in paragraph 3 of her Amended [*7]  Complaint; Plaintiff has stated no objection to the Court's reliance on the exhibit. See Dkt. 9 at 3 n.1; Dkt. 15. The Court finds that because Plaintiff has not challenged the authenticity of the exhibit, and because the document is integral to the Amended Complaint, this Court may properly consider the document at the motion-to-dismiss stage without converting Defendant's motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion. See Am. Chiropractic Ass'n v. Trigon Healthcare, Inc., 367 F.3d 212, 234 (4th Cir. 2004).
A. ADA Failure-to-Accommodate Claim (Count I)
Plaintiff's first claim alleges Defendant failed to accommodate her disability in violation of the ADA. To state a claim under the ADA for a failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must allege "(1) that [she] was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of [her] disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation [she] could perform the essential functions of the position . . .; and (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations." Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013) (citing Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n.11 (4th Cir. 2001)).
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that she has a disability within the meaning of the ADA and that Defendant had notice of her disability, which Defendant does not contest. But Defendant argues Plaintiff [*8]  has failed to plausibly allege a failure-to-accommodate claim because her employer's failure to provide her with an ergonomic keyboard and vertical mouse does not create liability under the statute. Relying on case law that makes clear the ADA merely requires an employer to provide a disabled employee with a reasonable accommodation, "not a perfect accommodation or an accommodation most preferable to the employee," Defendant argues that other accommodations it has afforded Plaintiff are sufficient to accommodate Plaintiff's needs. See Fink v. Richmond, 405 F. App'x 719, 723 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing Gile v. United Airlines, Inc., 95 F.3d 492, 499 (7th Cir. 1996)).
In addition, the third failure-to-accommodate factor is also satisfied in this case, as Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to find at the motion-to-dismiss stage "that with reasonable accommodation [she] could perform the essential functions of the position." Wilson, 717 F.3d at 345. Although Defendant points to other reasonable accommodations, namely Plaintiff's paid injury leave between January and October of 2019 and her modified light duty work schedule when she first returned to the office, see Dkt. 9 at 5-6, those accommodations bear only a glancing relationship to Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim. The theory of ADA liability in Count One alleges [*9]  a failure to accommodate beginning with Plaintiff's return to working full-time, twelve-and-a-half hour shifts beginning in February of 2020. Plaintiff alleges that without the requested accommodations during these full-time shifts, her disability inhibits her ability to perform police dispatching duties and taking calls from the public, which are essential functions of her job. The Court finds that the Amended Complaint contains facts sufficient to find Plaintiff has adequately alleged that a reasonable accommodation would have permitted her to continue performing the essential functions of her position.
The last factor, that Plaintiff's employer refused to make her accommodations, is easily satisfied based on the allegations in the Amended Complaint. Dkt. 7 ¶¶ 14-17. There is no doubt that Plaintiff plausibly alleges Defendant denied her request to be accommodated with an ergonomic keyboard and vertical mouse.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has satisfied the four elements of an ADA failure-to-accommodate claim at the motion-to-dismiss stage, and the Court will therefore not dismiss Count One.
B. Title VII Hostile Work Environment Claim (Count Two)
Plaintiff's second claim alleges that the disparate [*10]  treatment she experienced on the basis of her race amounts to a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. To state a hostile work environment claim, Plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to show that the alleged conduct she experienced was: (1) unwelcome; (2) based on her race; (3) sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and to create an abusive work environment; and (4) imputable to her employer. See Pryor v. United Air Lines, Inc., 791 F.3d 488, 495-96 (4th Cir. 2015). Said differently, to make out a prima facie hostile work environment claim, a plaintiff must plausibly plead that "the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Defendant contests only this severe and pervasive prong; according to Defendant, the isolated events Plaintiff alleges do not state a hostile work environment claim as a matter of law. Dkt. 13 at 3.
Plaintiff alleges that she and other African American employees have constantly been held to a different standard than white colleagues, that her work was more closely [*11]  scrutinized, that she has been denied opportunities for trainings and certification despite her seniority, and that minority employees were suspected of feigning illness after her supervisor suspected they attended protests in the wake of George Floyd's death. Dkt. 7 ¶ 18. Importantly, this element of a hostile work environment claim includes "both subjective and objective components." E.E.O.C. v. Cent. Wholesalers, Inc., 573 F.3d 167, 175 (4th Cir. 2009). Plaintiff must therefore show that she subjectively perceived her work environment as hostile and abusive, and that a reasonable person considering all the circumstances would objectively view the harassment as severe.
Taking all facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the allegations in the Amended Complaint do not clear Title VII's "high bar" for alleging sufficiently severe or pervasive workplace harassment. See E.E.O.C. v. Sunbelt Rentals, Inc., 521 F.3d 306, 315 (4th Cir. 2008). In this regard, the Court has considered the totality of the circumstances in determining that the workplace conduct Plaintiff experienced was not sufficiently severe or pervasive, including its (1) frequency; (2) severity; (3) whether the conduct was physically threatening or humiliating, or merely an offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interfered with [*12]  the plaintiff's work performance. Although this Court in no way condones what appear to be dispiriting workplace conditions for Plaintiff, the conduct she alleges in support of her hostile work environment claim simply does not rise to the level of a Title VII violation. See Bass, 324 F.3d at 765 (holding that "callous behavior by [a plaintiff's] superiors" is insufficient "to state a hostile work environment claim"). As a result, the Court dismisses Count Two of the Amended Complaint.
C. ADA Disability Discrimination Claim (Count Three)
Plaintiff's third claim alleges she was subjected to disability discrimination in violation of the ADA. To state a claim for disability discrimination, Plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to show that (1) she was a qualified individual with a disability; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) she was meeting her employer's legitimate expectations at the time of the adverse employment action; and (4) the circumstances of the adverse employment action raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. Reynolds v. Am. Nat'l Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 150 (4th Cir. 2012).
Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability or that her unpaid suspensions constituted adverse employment actions [*13]  under the ADA. Defendant does, however, argue that Plaintiff was not meeting her employer's legitimate expectations due to her tardiness and that the circumstances do not raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. The Court addresses these points in turn.
First, Plaintiff plausibly alleges that she was meeting her employer's legitimate expectations. Her tardiness, to the extent it affected those expectations, was minor; with one exception that occurred months before her suspension, Plaintiff's late arrivals to work fell between one and four minutes. These were minor infractions, and Defendant does not contend that there were any other grounds for imposing the unpaid suspensions. At least at this stage of litigation, Plaintiff has satisfied this element of her prima facie case of disability discrimination.
Second, Plaintiff received an unpaid suspension shortly after she voiced her opinions on workplace discrimination at the September 2, 2020 diversity and inclusion meeting. As Defendant points out, Plaintiff was late to work on multiple other occasions before she engaged in this protected activity, yet she appears to have never before been disciplined for such conduct. [*14]  See Dkt. 13 at 6. Only after this meeting did Plaintiff receive any discipline; she was first given an unpaid suspension for her tardiness on September 14, 2020, and she was again disciplined in December of 2020, when she alleges she was late to work after experiencing a medication-induced reaction. Dkt. 7 ¶¶ 21-22. And while this Court recognizes that an employer may impose reasonable workplace expectations and what may be perceived as chronic tardiness may be appropriately addressed, at the pleading stage, where a presumption of truth attaches to Plaintiff's well-pleaded allegations, the circumstances of these adverse employment actions raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination on the basis of Plaintiff's disability. Reynolds, 701 F.3d at 150.
Consequently, Count Three of the Amended Complaint will not be dismissed.
D. Title VII Retaliation Claim (Count Four)
Plaintiff's fourth cause of action alleges Defendant retaliated against her in violation of Title VII for her complaints of race discrimination. To state a prima facie retaliation claim under Title VII, Plaintiff must sufficiently allege "(1) that she engaged in protected activity, (2) that the employer took a materially adverse action against [*15]  her and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action." Evans v. Int'l Paper Co., 936 F.3d 183, 195 (4th Cir. 2019) (internal citations omitted).
Plaintiff has stated an actionable claim of retaliation under Title VII. Taking all facts alleged in the Amended Complaint as true, Plaintiff alleges that she engaged in protected conduct when she publicly addressed what she perceived as race-based disparate treatment at a September 2, 2020 meeting that centered on diversity and inclusion. Dkt. 7 ¶¶ 32-33. Complaining to one's supervisors of racial discrimination on the job is a protected activity. See Washington v. Digital Equip. Corp., 968 F.2d 1213 (4th Cir. 1992). Furthermore, Plaintiff alleges that she suffered an adverse action when was suspended without pay. This too is sufficient to state a claim for adverse action. See Parkinson v. Anne Arundel Med. Ctr., Inc., 214 F. Supp. 2d 511, 518 (D. Md. 2002), aff'd, 79 F. App'x 602 (4th Cir. 2003) ("Plaintiff's one-day, unpaid suspension . . . could constitute an adverse employment action.").
As for causation, Plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to reasonably infer that her complaints about racial discrimination in the workplace constituted a "but-for" cause of her employer's decision to suspend her without pay. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 362, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013) ("The text, structure, and history of Title VII demonstrate that a plaintiff making a retaliation claim under § 2000e-3(a) must establish [*16]  that his or her protected activity was a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer."). Here, Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant proposed her suspension on September 23, 2020, just twenty-one days after she addressed the disparate treatment at the September 2, 2020 diversity and inclusion meeting. Dkt. 7 ¶ 21. Although a plaintiff needs more provable circumstances to ultimately prevail on a disability discrimination claim, such temporal proximity is sufficient at the pleading stage to give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. Cf. Miller v. Md. Dep't of Nat. Res., 813 F. App'x 869, 879 (4th Cir. 2020) (finding that plaintiff had adequately alleged retaliation claim where plaintiff was terminated twenty-seven days after his last accommodation request). Because this close temporal proximity suggests that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that there is an adequate causal connection between her comments and her proposed suspension, these facts are sufficient to infer that Plaintiff's outspokenness about racial disparate treatment in her workplace was the but-for cause of her suspension. The Court therefore denies the Motion as to Count Four of the Amended Complaint.
IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that [*17]  Defendant's Motion (Dkt. 8) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The Motion is DENIED as to Counts One, Three, and Four. Defendant's Motion is GRANTED with respect to Count Two, as Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Count Two of the Amended Complaint is therefore DISMISSED; and it is
FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the original Complaint (Dkt. 4) is DENIED as MOOT.
It is SO ORDERED.
