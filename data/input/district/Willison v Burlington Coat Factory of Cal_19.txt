II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND1
In 2012, Bryan Willison was employed by Burlington, a retail clothing store, as a full-time store manager in Cathedral City, California. (Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Facts and Conclusions of Law in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("SGDMF") ¶ 1 [Doc. # 38].)
On June 11, 2012, Willison sent an email to Rebecca ("Becky") Seiler,2 the Market Human Resource Manager for Burlington, and Regina Palmer, his direct supervisor, stating that he would be out of work from June 11 to July 25. (Declaration of Rebecca Seiler in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment by Defendant ("Seiler Decl."), Ex. A ("June 11 Emails") [Doc. # 34-1].) He asked to be put on leave and to "have 1 weeks [sic] vacation time entered into the system for this week since disability will not [*3]  pay for the first 7 days." (Id.)
Seiler responded via email that she would enter Willison's request for a Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") leave of absence, and provided him with the number for contacting MetLife, explaining that MetLife would follow up with him shortly. (Id.) She wrote: "[a]s discussed, we will exhaust your vacation days and personal days beginning today." (Id.)
Palmer called Willison immediately after receiving his email. (SGMDF ¶ 4.) Willison stated in his deposition that Palmer called because she "wanted to know if [he] was okay" and whether he was going to be out for "workman's comp or FMLA." (Declaration of Clinton J. McCord ("McCord Decl.") [Doc. # 33], Ex. A, Deposition of Bryan Willison ("Willison Depo.") at 44:6-8 [Doc. # 33-1].) Palmer states in her declaration that she called Willison to ask him how he was doing and "if there was anything [she] could do to help." (Declaration of Regina Palmer in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment by Defendant ("Palmer Decl.") ¶ 2 [Doc. # 35].) Willison disputes that Palmer asked him if there was anything she could do to help. (SGDMF ¶ 4.)
There is a genuine dispute as to whether Willison told Palmer that his reason for taking leave was work-related or [*4]  a personal matter. Willison states in his deposition that he told Palmer that "it was work" but he "didn't feel comfortable talking to her about it." (Willison Depo. at 44:10-11; see also Declaration of Bryan Willison in Support of Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment ("Willison Decl.") ¶ 6 ("Shortly after my email, I spoke with Manager Palmer on the phone and informed her that my medical condition was work-related.")). Palmer states that Willison told her "repeatedly" that it was a personal matter and that he did not want to talk about it. (Palmer Decl. ¶ 2.)3 Palmer did not provide Willison with any information about how to apply for workers' compensation. (Willison Decl. ¶ 6.)
On June 12, 2012, Willison faxed two documents to Seiler—a handwritten cover page and a one-page Kaiser Permanente form entitled "Work Status Report." (SGDMF ¶ 7.) The report stated: "The patient is placed off work from 6/11/2012 through 7/27/2012." (Id. ¶ 7.) After Willison's doctor's appointment on or about July 17, 2012, Willison faxed Seiler a note from Dr. Tzakis with an updated extension of his medical leave from July 27, 2012 to August 27, 2012. (Willison Decl. ¶ 12; AMF ¶ 27). The reports did not [*5]  identify any specific medical condition or disability. (SGDMF ¶ 8.)
MetLife provided Willison with documents related to the FMLA and disability leave, and he provided them to his doctor. (Willison Decl. ¶ 9.) One of the documents Willison filled out and faxed to MetLife was entitled "Authorization to Disclose Information About Me." (Id., Ex. 3.) This form authorized any physician or other medical professional to disclose his entire medical record and any and all information about his health, medical care, employment, and disability claim to MetLife, and MetLife to disclose the same information to his employer in its capacity as an administrator of its benefit plans. (Id.) The form stated that the disclosure for "[f]or purposes of determining my eligibility for disability benefits, the administration of my employer's disability benefit plan (which may include assisting me with returning to work), and the administration of other benefit plans in which I participate that may be affected by my eligibility for disability benefits." (Id.)
On or around July 10, 2012, Willison's medical care provider, Kaiser Permanente, submitted a form to MetLife that stated he was "totally disabled" due to [*6]  diagnoses of "Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder," his job limitations were "any and all job functions when incapacitated," "treatment to continue prescription medication," and that he needed time off work for recovery. (Willison Decl. ¶¶ 9-11, Ex. 4.) On or about July 10, 2012, Kaiser sent MetLife a certification of Willison's health condition entitled "Certification of Health Care Provider for Employee's Serious Health Condition (Family and Medical Leave Act)." (Willison Decl., Ex. 5.) Rhodes and Seiler have both testified that the medical records that Willison submitted to MetLife would have qualified him for FMLA leave. (SGDMF AMF ¶ 77.)
On or around August 29, 2012, Willison expressed to MetLife his frustration with MetLife's continuous failure to authorize his FMLA leave and threatened to get an attorney if "the runaround continued." (Willison Decl. ¶ 15.) No one from Burlington contacted him to assist or investigate any complaint. (Id.)
On August 29, 2012, Seiler emailed Palmer and Burlington's Territory Human Resources Manager Kimberly Rhodes stating that Willison had been out since June 11, and that he had just notified her that he would [*7]  not be back until September 30. (Clark Decl, Ex. 8 ("August 29 Email chain.")) She stated that she had a candidate who could start in two weeks if they moved forward. (Id.) Rhodes replied, directing Seiler to contact Kim Alloway in the Benefits Department (and copying Alloway) to validate the dates of Willison's leave, determine whether it was FMLA or personal leave, and whether they were obligated to continue the leave of absence before discussing a replacement. (Id.)
Alloway replied to Seiler, Palmer, and Rhodes stating that there were "some issues with [Willison's] FMLA being approved at this time." (Id.) Alloway reports that someone at MetLife stated that they had contacted Willison several times about the medical certification that his had doctor provided, and that he had not provided all of the information required for them to make a determination. (Id.) Alloway continues: "MetLife indicated that Bryan is very frustrated with MetLife regarding this situation" and "Bryan has stated that if they do not approve the claim then he will get an attorney." (Id.) Alloway states that "Cheryl [from the Leave of Absence Office] did indicate that he is receiving California disability payments, [*8]  therefore they have approved his claim, but these are not one in the same and he must provide the proper documentation before approval can be granted." (Id.)
Willison's MetLife file includes an entry from September 12, 2012 at 3:47 p.m. logging "Call from HR — Cheryl." (Clark Decl., Ex. 7 at 11.) The comment column states that "Cm and HR discussed all the information on file — Incoming calls, outgoing calls, dated [sic] med rec'd and if letter was sent for [illegible]. CM and HR discussed claim for 44 minutes, HR has all information that is needed. CM thanked HR and call ended." (Id.) The entry immediately below states "Discuss med on file — Cm to call Cheryl Smith from HR to discuss." (Id.)
Willison's MetLife file also includes an entry from October 4, 2012 at 7:48 p.m. logging "csc fax drm and bha to kaiser." (Clark Decl., Ex. 7 at 10.) The comment column states: "Contacting Party: Bryan Willison . . . Dr. Evan George Tzakis . . . Attn: Insurance/Medical Correspondence Dept. . . . dx: anxiety depression major current uncontrollable symptoms." (Id.)
While Willison was on leave, Seiler called him "numerous times" to discuss his status and return date, and left voice messages asking him [*9]  to call back. (Seiler Decl. ¶ 4.)4 Seiler states that Willison never called her back to discuss his status. (Id.) Willison stated in his deposition that he spoke to Seiler on the phone twice in June of 2012 regarding other issues, but that Seiler never asked him why he was out of work. (Willison Depo. at 44:12-46:13.) Seiler did not keep a record of these phone calls. Clark Decl., Ex. 2, Deposition of Rebecca Leigh Seiler ("Seiler Depo.") at 73:22-74:6 [Doc. # 37-2].)
On August 28, 2012, Seiler text-messaged Willison to say that she tried his phone but wasn't able to get through to voicemail, and asked for an update on his return-to-work date. (Willison Decl., Ex. 8.) Willison responded via text message that he was still having health concerns, which was why the doctor had extended his return date to September 30, 2012. (Id.) Seiler responded, "Great. Please send me a copy of your note when you get a chance." (Id.) On August 29, 2012, Willison sent another two-page fax to Seiler with a Kaiser Work Status Report stating that Willison was "placed off work from 8/10/2012 to 9/30/2012." (SGDMF ¶ 11.)
Seiler called Willison on September 25, 2012 and informed him that he had "exhausted" all [*10]  of his leave and needed to come back to work on September 30. (SGDMF ¶¶ 16-17; Willison Depo. at 53:18-54:3.) Seiler testified at her deposition that during this call she informed Willison that his leave of absence had not been approved, and that he needed to call MetLife and ensure that his paperwork was in order. (Seiler Depo. at 76:7-17.) She informed him that once he did so, his leave would be approved. (Id. at 76:16-20.) Willison told Seiler that he had a doctor's appointment on September 27, 2012, and that he would get in touch with her with his work status after the appointment. (SGDMF ¶ 19.)
The parties dispute whether Seiler informed Willison on the September 25 phone call that the company would have to replace him if he did not return to work by September 30, 2012. (Id. ¶ 18.) In his deposition, Willison states that Seiler informed him that his leave would be "exhausted" as of September 30, 2012, but not that his position would be filled if he did not return. (Willison Depo. 53:18-54:20, 68:12-15.) Seiler states in her declaration that she "told [Willison] that if he did not report back to me after his doctor's appointment or report to work on September 30, 2012, his position [*11]  would have to be filled." (Seiler Decl. ¶ 8.)5 Willison states in his declaration that, "[a]t no time did [Seiler] ever mention to me that my job was in jeopardy." (Willison Decl. ¶ 19.)
There is a genuine dispute as to whether Willison faxed Seiler another doctor's note after his September 27, 2012 doctor's appointment. Willison states in his declaration that he sent Seiler a copy of his updated work status report "within a day or two" of his appointment. (Willison Decl. ¶ 18.) That status report stated: "This patient is placed off work form 9/27/2012 through 10/25/2012." (Willison Decl., Ex. 9.) Seiler states that she never received a fax from Willison on or after September 27, 2012, and that the company's records contain no fax from Willison on or after that date.6 (Seiler Decl. ¶ 9.) Willison did not report back to work on September 30, 2012. (SGDMF ¶ 20.)
Seiler testified in her deposition that she believes the decision to fill Willison's decision was made in September of 2012. (Seiler Depo. at 83:14-15.) She stated in her declaration that she made the decision on October 4, 2012. (Seiler Decl. ¶ 11.)
Seiler contacted Willison again on October 5, 2012, to inform him [*12]  that he would be receiving an overnight letter concerning his employment status. (Id. ¶ 24.) On October 5, 2012,7 Burlington Leave Administrator Michelle Cori sent Willison a letter stating:
Based on the expiration of any available FMLA leave (to the extent you are approved for such leave) as well as your failure to fulfill your responsibilities under the FMLA and Company policy, the Company has no choice but to fill your position as Store Manager during this critical business period and separate you from the Company effective October 5, 2012.
(Seiler Decl., Ex. D [Doc. # 34-4].)
The letter states that Willison "failed to communicate to [his] supervisor, Human Resources and/or the Leave Administrator concerning [his] intentions on returning to work" and still had not returned to work as of the day the letter was sent. (Id.) Willison states that he was "shocked" to read the letter, in part because he was "never informed by [his] employer that [his] job was in jeopardy or [that he] could be fired due to a lack of communication." (Willison Decl. ¶ 20.)
On December 11, 2012, Willison sent a letter to Burlington stating: "after my most recent visit to the doctor (on September 27, 2012) before [*13]  I had received the termination letter at issue, I had faxed Ms. Holman [Seiler] a doctor's note indicating that my doctor had extended my disability leave." (SGDMF ¶ 26.)
In 2012, Burlington had a policy or practice to not terminate employees for failing to provide documentation supporting the leave until the employee had been contacted regarding his status. (SGDMF AMF ¶ 13.) Under its own policies, Burlington had an obligation to communicate with MetLife concerning Willison's medical leave status and provide his managers a weekly log to show the status of his leave. (Id. AMF ¶ 19.) MetLife would typically keep Burlington informed as to the status of an employee's leave, and Burlington would communicate with MetLife if there were any questions. (Clark Decl, Ex. 4, Declaration of Kimberly Rhodes ("Rhodes Depo.") at 87:17-88:4.) Burlington had an obligation under its own corporate policies to communicate with MetLife to determine whether an employee could be accommodated with a personal leave of absence if the employee did not qualify for or had exhausted his FMLA leave. (Id. AMF ¶ 53.) Seiler did not keep a record of her communications with Willison, or communicate with MetLife to determine [*14]  whether Willison should be given personal leave. (Id. AMF ¶¶ 54, 63.)
It was also Burlington's policy in 2012 that any employee on leave be required to submit a medical certification confirming that the employee could perform the job before returning to work. (Id. AMF ¶ 44.) Seiler never received a release for Willison to return to work. (Id. AMF ¶ 45.) Burlington also had a policy in place permitting the company to send an employee for a second medical opinion for purposes of obtaining FMLA leave. (Id. ¶ AMF 46.) Willison was never sent to a second doctor. (Id.)
Burlington had a policy in 2012 requiring a 10-day exhaustion letter to be sent to an employee on leave before that employee was terminated, allowing the employee to comply with any further requirements for the leave to avoid termination. (Id. AMF ¶ 65.) Willison did not receive a 10-day exhaustion letter before being terminated. (Id. AMF ¶ 66.)

III.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment should be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); accord Wash. Mut. Inc. v. United States, 636 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Nat'l Ass'n of Optometrists & Opticians v. Harris, 682 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A dispute [*15]  is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its initial burden, Rule 56(c) requires the nonmoving party to "go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e)); see also Norse v. City of Santa Cruz, 629 F.3d 966, 973 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) ("Rule 56 requires the parties to set out facts they will be able to prove at trial.").
"In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). "Rather, it draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Id.

IV.

DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must show: "(1) he suffers from a disability,8 (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job,9 (3) he suffered an adverse employment action,10 and (4) the employer harbored discriminatory intent." Avila v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1246, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440, 448 (2008), as modified on denial of reh'g (Aug. 28, 2008). [*16]  To show that an employer acted with discriminatory intent, a plaintiff is required to produce evidence that the specific employees who decided to discharge him knew of his disability. Id. at 1248. Burlington contends that it did not have knowledge of Willison's disability, and so cannot be liable for disability discrimination.
A "known" disability is "a disability of which the employer has become aware, whether because it is obvious, the employee has brought it to the employer's attention, it is based on the employer's own perception—mistaken or not—of the existence of a disabling condition or . . . the employer has come upon information indicating the presence of a disability." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 61, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874, 895 (2006). "While knowledge of the disability can be inferred from the circumstances, knowledge will only be imputed to the employer when the fact of disability is the only reasonable interpretation of the known facts. Vague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations under the [FEHA]." Avila at 1248 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
There is conflicting evidence regarding when the [*17]  decision was made to fill Willison's managerial position, and who made it. According to Seiler, the decision was either made in September of 2012 or on October 4, 2012. The August 29 email chain indicates that the HR Department was beginning to discuss replacing Willison as early as August of 2012.
It is undisputed that MetLife had information regarding the specific nature and extent of Willison's disability by July 10, 2012. There is evidence that MetLife provided Burlington HR employee Cheryl Smith with "all information on file" about Willison on September 12, 2012. There is also evidence that on August 29, 2012, Seiler, Palmer, and Rhodes were in touch with Smith regarding the status of Willison's leave and her communications with MetLife regarding Willison. The August 29 email also indicates that Seiler and other members of the HR Department knew that Willison was receiving California disability payments and were attempting to determine whether they were obligated to continue the leave of absence before discussing a replacement.
Willison has demonstrated that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether the relevant decision-makers had knowledge of his disability at the time [*18]  the decision was made to terminate him.

B. Failure to Accommodate
It is an unlawful employment practice "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an . . . employee." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). Under the express provisions of the FEHA, the employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual is a violation of the statute in and of itself." Diaz v. Fed. Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1054 (C.D. Cal. 2005). "In order to succeed on a FEHA claim for failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must show that he (1) has a disability of which the employer is aware, and (2) is a qualified individual." Id. "Unlike for a claim for employment discrimination, a plaintiff need not establish that an adverse employment action was caused by the plaintiff's disability because, as stated, a FEHA claim for failure to accommodate is an independent cause of action." Id.
A leave of absence is a form of reasonable accommodation. Sanchez v. Swissport, Inc., 213 Cal. App. 4th 1331, 1339, 153 Cal. Rptr. 3d 367, 372 (2013) (noting "the right to take a leave of absence as a form of reasonable accommodation under Government Code section 12940."); Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487, 494 (1999) (holding that "a finite leave of absence has been considered to be a reasonable accommodation under ADA, provided it is likely that following the leave the employee would [*19]  be able to perform his or her duties"); see also Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal.App.4th 245, 263, 102 Cal.Rptr.2d 55 (2000) ( "Holding a job open for a disabled employee who needs time to recuperate or heal is in itself a form of reasonable accommodation and may be all that is required where it appears likely that the employee will be able to return to an existing position at some time in the foreseeable future"); Nunes v. Wal—Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that an unpaid medical leave may be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA). Whether a leave request is reasonable generally turns on the facts of each case. Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 954, 62 Cal. Rptr. 142 (1997) ("Ordinarily the reasonableness of an accommodation is an issue for the jury.") (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
Burlington contends that Willison never made any request for accommodation, and therefore Burlington cannot be liable for a failure to accommodate. Willison initially requested a leave of absence, which is a form of reasonable accommodation. At that time, Burlington granted him this leave of absence, and provided that accommodation up until October 5, 2012. There is a genuine dispute of fact as to whether Willison provided Seiler with an additional update after his September 27, 2012 doctor's appointment indicating that his doctor was continuing to put [*20]  him on leave past September 30, 2012. There is therefore a triable issue as to whether Willison requested the accommodation of an additional leave of absence for medical reasons and that Burlington did not accommodate the request.

C. Good Faith, Interactive Process
The Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") states that it is an unlawful employment practice "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). "Failure to engage in this process is a separate FEHA violation independent from an employer's failure to provide a reasonable disability accommodation, which is also a FEHA violation." Wysinger v. Auto. Club of S. California, 157 Cal. App. 4th 413, 424, 69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 10 (2007).
An employer's obligation to engage in a good faith, interactive process is triggered by an employee giving notice of the employee's disability and the desire for accommodation. Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 2000), vacated on other grounds sub nom. U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002). "In circumstances in which an employee is unable to make such a request, if [*21]  the company knows of the existence of the employee's disability, the employer must assist in initiating the interactive process." Id.
As discussed above, there are triable issues of fact as to whether Burlington had notice of Willison's disability or desire for additional accommodation, and whether the obligation to engage in a good faith interactive process was triggered. Burlington contends that Willison "frustrated" the interactive process by failing to communicate, and in particular by failing to pick up the phone when Seiler called or respond to her voice messages.
Seiler claims she made a number of attempts to contact Willison to determine his work status and intended return date, but failed to keep a record of those communications. There is evidence that Burlington failed to follow its own policies regarding employee leave and termination in its dealings with Willison. See Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc., 658 F.3d 1108, 1117 (9th Cir. 2011) ("[A]n employer's deviation from established policy or practice" may be evidence of pretext or bad faith). Burlington did not send a 10-day exhaustion letter before terminating Willison, send Willison to a second doctor, or obtain a release for Willison to return to work before telling him that he was required [*22]  to return to work on September 30. There are triable issues of fact regarding whether Burlington communicated with MetLife regarding Willison's eligibility for medical or personal leave.
Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, the Court concludes that there are triable issues regarding whether Burlington failed to engage in a good faith, interactive process and whether Willison frustrated that process by his failure to communicate.

D. Retaliation in Violation of the Fair Employment & Housing Act
In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 436 (2005). "The retaliatory motive is proved by showing that plaintiff engaged in protected activities, that his employer was aware of the protected activities, and that the adverse action followed within a relatively short time thereafter." Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hosp., 214 Cal. App. 3d 590, 615, 262 Cal. Rptr. 842 (1989).
Willison complained to MetLife in August of 2012 that he was frustrated by the denial of his FMLA and disability leave and that he would "get an attorney involved" [*23]  if this "runaround" continued. As of August 29, 2012, Seiler, Rhodes, and Palmer were aware of the fact that Willison was frustrated with MetLife and had threatened to retain a lawyer. Although it is not clearly established who made the decision to terminate Willison, and when, the HR employees who appear to have been most closely involved with the decision to terminate him were aware of his threat to hire a lawyer shortly before they made the decision to terminate him, whether that decision took place in September or early October of 2012. See Fisher, 214 Cal. App. 3d at 615 ("The causal link may be established by an inference derived from circumstantial evidence, such as the employer's knowledge that the employee engaged in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected action and allegedly retaliatory employment decision.") (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, there are triable issues of fact as to whether there is a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.

E. Failure to Prevent/Remedy Discrimination and/or Retaliation
It is an unlawful employment practice in California for [*24]  an employer "to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and retaliation from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code §1240(k). "The employer's duty to prevent . . . discrimination is affirmative and mandatory." Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc., 178 Cal. App. 4th 243, 288, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 296, 333 (2009). Burlington argues only that the underlying discrimination and retaliation claims fail, and therefore the failure to prevent or remedy discrimination and/or retaliation claims must fail. See Trujillo v. N. Cnty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998), as modified (May 12, 1998) ("Employers should not be held liable to employees for failure to take necessary steps to prevent such conduct, except where the actions took place and were not prevented.")
Because Willison's retaliation and discrimination claims survive, the failure to prevent cause of action also survives.

F. Violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA")
It is unlawful "for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under" the CFRA. Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(t). The CFRA is the state counterpart to the FMLA. See Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1132 (9th Cir. 2003). Under both Acts, employees have the right to take qualified leave and to be restored to their original position or a position equivalent in benefits, pay, and conditions of employment upon return from leave. Id. An employer [*25]  is responsible for properly identifying FMLA or CFRA leave, and a violation "simply requires that the employer deny the employee's entitlement to FMLA [or CFRA] leave." Id. at 1135. A mischaracterization of medical leave as personal leave qualifies as a violation. Id. The Acts' "enforcement mechanisms protect employees against having to plead and negotiate with their supervisors to be granted leave they are entitled to receive under both FMLA and CFRA." Id. at 1135 (emphasis in original).
Both Seiler and Rhodes have stated that the paperwork Willison submitted to MetLife was sufficient to qualify him for FMLA/CFRA leave. There are triable issues of fact as to whether Burlington deprived Willison of his right to CFRA leave and whether his right to be restored to his original position or an equivalent position was violated.

G. Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy
"California restricts an employer's right to discharge its employees when such discharge is prohibited by statute or violates public policy." Montag v. Aerospace Corp., 94 F.3d 652 (9th Cir. 1996). Because Willison's claims for disability discrimination and violation of the CFRA survive, his claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy survives as well.

V.

CONCLUSION
In light of [*26]  the foregoing, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED in its entirety.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
