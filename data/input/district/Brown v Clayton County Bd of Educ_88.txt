Opinion



MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S NON-FINAL ORDER AND REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is presently before the Court on Defendant Clayton County School District's ("Defendant" or "CCSD") Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint ("Motion to Dismiss," Doc. 4), and Plaintiff's Request for Leave to File an Amended Complaint ("Motion to Amend," Doc. 6). For the reasons outlined below, this Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss GRANTED. (Doc. 4). If the Report and Recommendation is adopted, Plaintiff's Motion to Amend is GRANTED. (Doc. 6).
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Micah Brown ("Plaintiff") filed this lawsuit on May 11, 2016. (Doc. 1). Therein, Plaintiff alleges that the Clayton County Board of Education [*2]  (the "Board"), among other things, (1) interfered with his rights in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq. ("FMLA"); (2) discriminated against him on the basis of his disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. ("ADA"); (3) discriminated against him in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 ("RA"); (4) discriminated against him on the basis of his race and retaliated against him in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. ("Title VII"); and (5) retaliated against him in violation of the Georgia Whistleblower statute, O.C.G.A. § 45-1-4. (Compl., Doc. 1).
In the Motion to Dismiss, Defendant contends that (1) Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed because the Board is not an entity capable of being sued; (2) Plaintiff's ADA and Title VII claims are time-barred; (3) Plaintiff's RA claim fails to state a plausible claim for relief; (4) Plaintiff's FLMA claim fails as no damages are or can be plead; and (5) Plaintiff's Georgia Whistleblower claim is barred by the statute of limitations. (Doc. 4).
In his Motion to Amend, Plaintiff seeks to reassert his FMLA, ADA, RA, and Title VII claims against Defendant CCSD, conceding that the Board is an improper party to [*3]  the litigation and that his Whistleblower claims are barred. (Doc. 6).

I. Plaintiff's Employment and Alleged Race Discrimination
CCSD1 employed Plaintiff as a School Resource Officer ("SRO") for over two years. (Compl. ¶ 17). Plaintiff alleges that around February 2014, he — the only Caucasian SRO — was assigned extra duties in violation of CCSD practices and procedures, while no African-American SRO's were. (Compl. ¶¶ 18-27). Plaintiff alleges he objected, and that his supervisor threatened him and lowered his performance evaluations, due to both his race and in retaliation for Plaintiff's complaints about his treatment. (Compl. ¶¶ , 28-33, 70-75). Plaintiff also alleges that his termination in May 8, 2015, was discriminatory and/or in retaliation for complaining about his supervisor's conduct. (Compl. ¶¶ 50, 76-79).

II. Alleged Disability Discrimination
Plaintiff severely injured his knee on December 3, 2014, which required surgery. (Compl. ¶¶ 34-35). Between the injury and surgery, Plaintiff asserts that his ability to walk was substantially impaired for approximately twelve months. (Compl. ¶ 36). Plaintiff apparently took leave sometime immediately or soon after, though it is not clear [*4]  when it began. After CCSD informed Plaintiff that he was required to return to work full duty on March 19, 2015, Plaintiff requested what he alleges was a reasonable accommodation under the ADA — asking either that he be granted additional leave through the end of the school year, which occurred on May 22, 2015, or that he be allowed to work light duty through the end of the school year. (Compl. ¶¶ 40-42, 47). SROs do not work during the summer, and Plaintiff asserts that his recovery would have been sufficient to allow him to perform all the essential functions of his SRO position starting with the next school year. (Compl. ¶¶ 43-44). CCSD granted Plaintiff some additional leave, but still required Plaintiff to report to full work duty on May 6, 2015, rejecting his request for either light work duty or continued leave through the final few weeks of school. (Compl. ¶¶ 45-49). When Plaintiff apparently did not report to full duty work, CCSD terminated his employment on May 8, 2015. (Compl. ¶ 50). Plaintiff claims that Defendant's rejection of his requested accommodation — either allowing him to perform light duty work or leave through the end of the school year — amounted to a violation [*5]  of the ADA and RA, and resulted in his termination. (Compl. ¶¶ 60-69).

III. Alleged FMLA Interference
After Plaintiff had been on leave for well over a month following his knee injury and surgery, CCSD notified him on February 4, 2015, that he would be required to take FMLA leave and that all of that leave — dating back to December 4, 2014 — would be designated as FMLA leave, despite the fact that Plaintiff did not request FMLA leave. (Compl. ¶ 37-39). Plaintiff alleges CCSD violated the FMLA by retroactively designating his leave as FMLA leave, and that the designation ultimately resulted in his termination, apparently because the post-dated FMLA designation precluded Plaintiff's use of FMLA leave later — at the end of the school year. (Compl. ¶¶ 55-59).

IV. EEOC Charge of Discrimination
On May 8, 2015, Plaintiff filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging Defendant violated Title VII and the ADA. (Compl. ¶ 51, Ex. 2 (EEOC Charge)).2 The EEOC issued a notice of right to sue letter on January 27, 2016. (Compl. ¶ 52, Ex. 3 (Dismissal and Notice of Rights Letter)). According to the Complaint, on April 22, 2016, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a Tolling [*6]  Agreement "to toll the statute of limitations for the claims presented herein," which expired May 9, 2016. (Compl. ¶¶ 53-54; see also Compl. Ex. 1 (Tolling Agreement)). As noted, Plaintiff filed this action on May 11, 2016. (Doc. 1).

V. Tolling Agreement
The Tolling Agreement was executed by Plaintiff on Friday, April 22, 2016; sent to Defendant that same day at 4:00 P.M.; and executed by Defendant on Monday April 25, 2016. (Doc. 1-3, pp. 3-4; Doc. 5-1 (email from Plaintiff's counsel transmitting Tolling Agreement)). According to the Tolling Agreement's terms, it was "made and entered into as of Friday April 22, 2016." (Id., p. 1). In consideration for Plaintiff "forbearing at this time from filing a lawsuit," the parties agreed that any and all statute of limitations and/or "deadlines" applicable to claims under Title VII and/or the ADA would be "tolled up to and including the fifteenth day after the date of th[e Tolling] Agreement," which was defined as the "Tolling Period." (Id.). The parties agreed that the Tolling Agreement would "expire seventeen (17) days after the execution by both parties, up to and including May 9, 2106 [sic], unless extended by the [*7]  written agreement of both parties." (Id., p. 2). The Tolling Agreement further stated that Defendant could not use as a defense any statute of limitations or the expiration of any filing deadlines that is "based upon or incorporate[s] time elapsed during the Tolling period," but that Defendant was not limited to asserting such defenses that "may become applicable after the Tolling Period." (Id.).

DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS
Defendant notes that the Board is not a entity capable of being sued, and urges that all claims against the Board be dismissed. (Doc. 4-1, p. 5 (citing Cook v. Colquitt Cty Bd. of Edu., 261 Ga 841, 412 S.E.2d 828 (1992)). Plaintiff agrees (Docs. 5, 6), and the Court deems such claims abandoned, Holland v. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 51 F. Supp. 3d 1357, 1376 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (finding plaintiff abandoned claim for punitive damages when defendant failed to respond to defendant's argument on motion to dismiss that claim was barred by sovereign immunity); LR 7.1(B) (failure to file a response to a motion indicates that the motion is unopposed); see also Coalition for the Abolition of Marijuana Prohibition v. City of Atlanta, 219 F.3d 1301, 1326 (11th Cir. 2000) (finding that a party's failure to brief and argue an issue before the district court is grounds for declaring it abandoned). Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss should be GRANTED, and all of Plaintiff's claims against the Board should be DISMISSED.

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO AMEND [*8] 
Plaintiff seeks leave to reassert his claims against the proper defendant — CCSD — and CCSD does not oppose the substitution of parties, accordingly, Plaintiff's Motion to Amend is GRANTED in this regard. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). However, Defendant opposes Plaintiff's Motion to Amend as it pertains to Plaintiff's Title VII, ADA, RA, and FMLA claims, arguing that these claims are futile for the same reasons outlined in the Motion to Dismiss.3

I. Standard of Review
When the time for amendment as of right has passed, "a party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The court has discretion to make this determination, but it must provide a substantial basis for such a denial. Shipner v. Eastern Air Lines, 868 F.2d 401, 407 (11th Cir. 1989) (policy embodied in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure favors liberality of amendments). The Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit have enumerated factors that permit the denial of a motion to amend. These factors include undue prejudice to the opposing party, undue delay, bad faith on the part of the movant, futility of the motion, or repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962); Equity Lifestyle Props., Inc. v. Florida Mowing and Landscape, 556 F.3d 1232, 1241 (11th Cir. 2009). Here's Defendant [*9]  opposed Plaintiff's proposed amendments as futile. "An amendment adding a cause of action is considered futile if the new cause of action does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted." See Spanish Broad. Sys. of Fla., Inc. v. Clear Channel Commnc'ns, Inc., 376 F.3d 1065, 1077 (11th Cir. 2004); Rudolph v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 800 F.2d 1040, 1042 (11th Cir. 1986). Thus, a "proposed amendment is futile if the complaint, as amended, would be subject to dismissal." Galindo v. ARI Mut. Ins. Co., 203 F.3d 771, 777 n.10 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Wyatt v. BellSouth, Inc., 176 F.R.D. 627, 630 (M.D. Ala. 1998) ("In deciding whether the amendment to the complaint would be futile, the court should be guided by the principles that govern consideration of a motion to dismiss."). Thus, if assuming the truth of the factual allegations of the amended complaint, there is a dispositive legal issue which precludes relief or if it is based on an meritless legal theory, leave to amend should be denied. Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 326, 109 S. Ct. 1827, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1989); Brown v. Crawford County, 960 F.2d 1002, 1009-10 (11th Cir. 1992); see also Battle v. Cent. State Hosp., 898 F.2d 126, 128 (11th Cir. 1990) (citation and internal quotations omitted) (when a[n amended] complaint raises an arguable question of law which the district court ultimately finds is correctly resolved against the plaintiff," the proposed amended complaint is futile, and leave to amend should be denied). Additionally, a proposed claim "requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). To state a claim with sufficient specificity requires [*10]  that the complaint have enough factual matter taken as true to suggest required elements of the claim. Watts v. Fla. Int'l Univ., 495 F.3d 1289, 1296 (11th Cir. 2007); Hill v. White, 321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir. 2003). Factual allegations in a complaint need not be detailed but "must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 508 n.1, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002)). II. Plaintiff's Title VII and ADA Claims are Not Barred Defendant first argues Plaintiff's Title VII and ADA claims are administratively barred because Plaintiff's deadline for filing those claims expired May 9, 2016. (Doc. 4). Specifically, Defendant contends that the effective date of the Tolling Agreement was April 22, 2016, and that it only tolled the deadline for filing a complaint fifteen days (i.e. the "Tolling Period"); as a result, Defendant urges, the deadline for Plaintiff to file his claims was May 9, 2016, fifteen days after April 22, 2016. Plaintiff counters that the Tolling Agreement allowed his claims to be filed several days after May 9, 2016, because the Tolling Agreement tolled the period for filing the claims for seventeen days from the date Defendant executed the agreement on April 25, 2016. (Doc. 5). The Court finds [*11]  that regardless of the parties' contrary interpretations of the Tolling Agreements' effective date and what exactly was tolled by the agreement (the deadline or the filing period itself), Defendant cannot now argue that Plaintiff's Complaint was untimely, based upon the plain language of the Tolling Agreement. Before commencing a civil action, a Title VII and/or ADA plaintiff must first exhaust his administrative remedies, beginning with the filing of a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(b); 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a); E.E.O.C. v. Summer Classics, Inc., 471 F. App'x 868, 869-70 (11th Cir. 2012); Zillyette v. Capital One Fin. Corp., 179 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir. 1999); see also Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir. 2001); Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 865 F.2d 1237, 1239 (11th Cir. 1989). After the EEOC's investigation into the charge, and upon receipt of the EEOC's notice of right to sue, a plaintiff must file a judicial complaint within ninety days. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1); 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a); Zillyette, 179 F.3d at 1339; see also Santini v. Cleveland Clinic Fla., 232 F.3d 823 (11th Cir. 2000) ("Title VII . . . actions may not be brought more than 90 days after a complainant has adequate notice that the EEOC has dismissed the Charge."). When "a plaintiff does not assert that he or she received the right-to-sue letter on a specific date, the Court presumes the plaintiff received the letter three days after it was mailed." Marshall v. Eadison, No. 7:04CV123HL, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31376, 2005 WL 3132352, *2 (M.D. Ga. Nov. 22, 2005) (citing Baldwin Cnty. Welcome Ctr. v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 148, 104 S. Ct. 1723, 80 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1984) (other internal citations omitted)); Mack v. W.R. Grace Co., 578 F. Supp. 626, 631 n.5 (N.D. Ga. 1983). Generally, under Rule 9(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a Title VII Plaintiff need only generally allege that all conditions [*12]  precedent to the institution of the lawsuit have been fulfilled. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(c)(stating that "[i]n pleading conditions precedent, it suffices to allege generally that all conditions precedent have occurred or been performed."); Myers v. Cent. Fla. Inv., 592 F.3d 1201, 1224 (11th Cir. 2010); Rizo v. Ala. Dep't of Human Res., 228 F. App'x 832, 836 (11th Cir. 2007); Jackson v. Seaboard Coast Line R. Co., 678 F.2d 992, 1010 (11th Cir. 1982) (holding that "a plaintiff must generally allege in his complaint that 'all conditions precedent to the institution of the lawsuit have been fulfilled."). However, once a defendant challenges the timeliness of the lawsuit, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing its timeliness. Green v. Union Foundry Co., 281 F.3d 1229, 1233 (11th Cir. 2002); Kerr v. McDonald's Corp., 427 F.3d 947, 951 (11th Cir. 2005). The ninety-day deadline is strict. See Norris v. Fla. Dep't of Health & Rehabilitative Servs., 730 F.2d 682, 683 (11th Cir. 1984) (rejecting as untimely a judicial complaint filed ninety-one days after receipt of a notice of right to sue). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has held that "[f]iling a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling." Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1982); see also Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1990). As noted, Plaintiff's notice of right to sue was mailed out by the EEOC on January 27, 2016. Between the ninety-day period provided under Title VII and the ADA, and the three day presumption regarding receipt, Plaintiff's Title VII and ADA claims, absent [*13]  the Tolling Agreement, would need to have been filed on or before April 29, 2016. The parties agreed, however, to extend that period. Regardless of the parties' differing interpretations of the start and length of Tolling Agreement's extension, the Agreement plainly states that: [CCSD] will not interpose in any lawsuit as a defense, affirmative defense, issue on appeal or action between the parties (a) any defense that the applicable statute of limitations or filing deadline shall have expired or passed based upon or incorporating time elapsed during the Tolling Period . . . . (Doc. 1-1, p. 2 (emphasis added)). As a consequence of that provision, Defendant may not now argue that Plaintiff's filing deadline expired by including in its calculation any of the time that took place during the Tolled Period, which the Tolling Agreement explicitly provided was fifteen days. In other words, the fifteen-day Tolled Period must be excluded in calculating Plaintiff's filing deadline. The effective result is that ninety-day period is extended by the Tolling Period, and the earliest date Defendant can argue Plaintiff's deadline expired is fifteen days after the original filing deadline — May 14, [*14]  2016. na4 Accordingly, Defendant's argument that Plaintiff failed to timely file his Title VII and ADA claims fails, and the Motion to Amend is not futile with regard those 4 Even if Plaintiff received the notice of right to sue the day after it was mailed, Plaintiff had until May 12, 2016, to file the claims. claims. Plaintiff's Motion to Amend is GRANTED as it relates to his Title VII and ADA claims. III. Plaintiff's Disability-Based Claims are Not Futile Defendant next argues Plaintiff's disability-based claims fail as a matter of law because an "open-ended request for [] leave is unreasonable as a matter of law." (Doc. 4-1, pp. 9). Under both the ADA and RA an employer must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with known disabilities unless the accommodations would cause undue hardship to the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ( "[T]he term 'discriminate' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical . . . limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an ... employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business . . . ."); 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); see also Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, 544 F.3d 1201, 1209, 1212 n. 6 (11th Cir. 2008); Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007); Earl v. Meryns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). Whether an accommodation [*15]  is reasonable depends on specific circumstances. Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626 (11th Cir. 1998); see also 29 C.F.R. §§ 1630.2(n)-(p). Viewing Plaintiff's complaint liberally within the confines of Iqbal and Twombly, the Court finds that the proposed ADA and RA claims contain sufficient allegations of factual content to plausibly support Plaintiff's allegations of discrimination based upon a failure to accommodate his alleged disability. Plaintiff alleges that he requested either leave through the school year or light duty work, and the inference can be drawn that either the modification of his schedule or reassignment to light duty would have been a reasonable accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); see also Allen v. Georgia Power Co., 980 F. Supp. 470, 478 n. 3 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (stating that "if an employer already has a vacant light duty position for which an injured worker is qualified, it might be a reasonable accommodation to reassign the worker to that position."). Defendant's argument that Plaintiff requested open-ended leave asks this Court to accept facts not contained in the proposed claims (e.g., that Plaintiff refused to provide CCSD with information about his fitness to return to work) and/or to draw inferences against Plaintiff (that he in fact could not return to work in any capacity or requested unending leave). The Court declines [*16]  to do so at this juncture. The question of whether Defendant provided a reasonable accommodation is more properly reserved for summary judgment. Accordingly, the Plaintiff's ADA and RA claims do not fail as a matter of law, and the Motion to Amend is GRANTED with regard to those claims. IV. Plaintiff's FMLA Claim is Not Futile Finally, Defendant argues Plaintiff's proposed FMLA interference claim fails because Plaintiff has not alleged any harm and cannot do so, since he has acknowledged receiving a full twelve weeks of FMLA leave provided under the statute. (Doc. 4). Plaintiff argues that, but-for the improper retroactive designation of his leave as FMLA leave on February 4, 2015, Plaintiff would have remaining FMLA leave, which, in conjunction with the thirty-days additional leave provided by Defendants, would have allowed him to finish out the remainder of the school year on leave; accordingly, Plaintiff argues, that improper designation interfered with his leave-taking and resulted in his termination. (Doc. 5, pp. 7, 9-11). The FMLA gives employees the right to twelve weeks of unpaid leave due to a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to work. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). An employer must [*17]  not "interfere with, restrain, or deny [an employee's] exercise of or [his] attempt to exercise" FMLA rights. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). An employee claiming interference must show he was entitled to a benefit that he was denied. Penaloza v. Target Corp., 549 F. App'x 844, 847 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1206-07 (11th Cir. 2001)). Plaintiff has asserted an interference claim, alleging Defendant improperly designated his otherwise non-FMLA leave as FMLA leave retroactively. Under 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(d)(1), an employer must give an employee notice of its designation of leave as FMLA-related leave within five days of the employer acquiring knowledge that the leave qualifies as such. If the employer fails to do so, it: may be liable for compensation and benefits lost by reason of the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate equitable or other relief, including employment, reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief tailored to the harm suffered. 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(d)(1)(citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.400(c)). The parties agree that Plaintiff alleges Defendant had such knowledge in December 2014, and failed to notify him of its FMLA designation until February 4, 2015. Defendant, however, argues that because 29 C.F.R. § 825.301 permits retroactive designation if that does not result in harm to an employee, and because Plaintiff [*18]  received all twelve weeks of FMLA leave permitted by the statute, he cannot make out an FMLA interference claim. 29 C.F.R. § 825.301(d) provides that (outside of an employer and employee agreeing to it) retroactive designation may be allowed if the failure to timely designate FLMA-related leave "does not cause harm or injury to the employee." The following subsection provides two illustrations helpful to the present case. For example, if an employer that was put on notice that an employee needed FMLA leave failed to designate the leave properly, but the employee's own serious health condition prevented him or her from returning to work during that time period regardless of the designation, an employee may not be able to show that the employee suffered harm as a result of the employer's actions. However, if an employee took leave to provide care for a son or daughter with a serious health condition believing it would not count toward his or her FMLA entitlement, and the employee planned to later use that FMLA leave to provide care for a spouse who would need assistance when recovering from surgery planned for a later date, the employee may be able to show that harm has occurred as a result of the employer's [*19]  failure to designate properly. The employee might establish this by showing that he or she would have arranged for an alternative caregiver for the seriously ill son or daughter if the leave had been designated timely. 29 C.F.R. § 825.301(e). Defendant urges that because Plaintiff did not return to work following his FMLA-designated leave, plus additional leave provided, he cannot show that he was harmed by the retroactive designation. (Doc. 4-1, 9-13 (citing McGregor v. Autozone, Inc., 180 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir. 1999) (deciding at summary judgment that a plaintiff has no automatic reinstatement right to work after concurrently running FMLA and thirteen-week maternity leave both expired; and that regulations suggesting FMLA had to be allowed after paid leave were invalid); Penaloza v. Target Corp., 549 F. App'x 844, 848 (11th Cir. 2013) (without any discussion of retroactive designation or 29 C.F.R. § 825.301, deciding at summary judgment that because employer provided over twelve weeks of leave, Plaintiff could not show she was denied benefit to which she was entitled under the FLMA — that is, twelve weeks of leave) and Jones v. Gulf Coast Health Care of Dela., LLC, No. 8:15-CV-702-T-24EAJ, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19710, 2016 WL 659308, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 18, 2016) (deciding upon summary judgment motion that because a plaintiff failed to show that he was treated differently than other employees with regard to the required [*20]  fitness-for-duty certification required for return to work, he could not establish an FMLA interference claim); see also Doc. 7, p. 7-9 (citing Sarno v. Douglas Elliman-Gibbons & Ives, Inc., 183 F.3d 155, 161-62 (2d Cir. 1999) (deciding at summary judgment that because a plaintiff was unable to show that he could have returned to work for two months after the twelve-week leave period expired, he could not demonstrate that his employer impeded his reinstatement or return to work). Defendant's argument here is, like his arguments regarding Plaintiff's disability-based claims, premature. Each opinion cited is distinguishable for at least two reasons — first, none is directed at an interference claim based upon retroactive designation of FMLA leave, and second, because each decision was made at summary judgment, after discovery had established that no harm could be maintained. In the closest case to Plaintiff's, McGregor v. Autozone, Inc., the plaintiff sought reinstatement because her employer failed to notify her that FMLA-related leave would not be available after and in addition to her thirteen-week paid maternity leave; the court held that a reinstatement claim was unavailable in that case because the regulations themselves — requiring twelve additional weeks of [*21]  leave unless an employer provided employees with prospective notice that the employer-provide paid leaves would run concurrently — were themselves invalid. McGregor v. Autozone, Inc., 180 F.3d at 1306-1308. Here, Plaintiff makes no allegation or argument that any other type of leave could not have run concurrently with his FMLA-related leave; rather, Plaintiff argues he was harmed because CCSD's lack of timely notice that his leave was being designated FMLA interfered with when and how he would take that FMLA-related leave at all, and resulted in his termination. (Doc. 5, p. 9-11). In this way, Plaintiff's claim is more similar to the second example provided in 29 C.F.R. § 825.301(e) — Plaintiff's argues he would have made different arrangements if he had been timely notified of the FMLA designation. (Id.). The Autozone Court specifically did not address whether allegations regarding failure to provide notice of FMLA-designation would constitute an interference claim, as opposed to reinstatement claim, when twelve weeks of leave had been provided. See McGregor v. Autozone, Inc., 180 F.3d at 1308; see also Cox v. Autozone, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1369, 1381 n.1 (M.D. Ala. 1998) (disallowing as untimely Plaintiff's proposed amendment to include a failure to notice interference claim) (emphasis added), aff'd sub nom., McGregor v. Autozone, Inc., 180 F.3d 1305. The other cited cases are even more distinguishable. [*22]  In Penaloza, the court simply held that if a plaintiff receives twelve-weeks of leave, she cannot claim that the FMLA benefit of having twelve weeks of leave was interfered with. 549 F. at 848. In Jones, the interference was based disparate treatment between the plaintiff and other employees regarding their certification to return to work, not retroactive designation. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19710, 2016 WL 659308, at *4. More importantly, a motion for judgment on the pleadings was denied earlier in that action, when the employer argued — like CCSD here — that the claims should be dismissed "because Plaintiff was given twelve weeks of FMLA leave, which . . . expired on December 18, 2014. By failing to return to work on December 19, 2014, [the employer] assert[ed] that [the p]laintiff forfeited his rights" under the FMLA. Jones v. Gulf Coast Health Care of Del., LLC, No. 8:15-CV-702-T-24EAJ, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136199, 2015 WL 5895393, at *2-3 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 6, 2015). Indeed, the Jones court explicitly rejected that argument at the pleading stage (and construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff), and allowed the claims to proceed to discovery. Id. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136199, [WL] at 3. Finally, in Sarno, the interference was alleged to have occurred at the return to work stage (upon discovery, there was no dispute plaintiff was unable to [*23]  return to work for two months after his leave expired), and was not based upon retroactive designation; in fact, the employer informed the employee within two days of his taking leave following an injury that his leave would be designated FLMA-related leave. Sarno, 183 F.3d at 157-58, 161-62. Again taking Plaintiff's allegations in the light most favorable to him and within the context of Iqbal and Twombly, the Court finds that Plaintiff plausibly suggests a claim for FMLA interference. Specifically, Plaintiff plausibly alleges that but for CCSD's failure to designate his leave as provided in 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(d)(1), he would have used his leave differently and he would have been able to return to work without being terminated (provided he was granted a reasonable accommodation provided under the ADA). (Compl., ¶¶ 34-56). As a result, Plaintiff has alleged he was harmed by CCSD's failure to notify him of the FMLA-designation. Whether Plaintiff would have or could have used his leave differently, returned to work, and/or avoided termination, and whether he should have been granted his requested accommodation under the ADA are matters for discovery in this case, and the Court will not decide the issue based solely on the pleadings. Jones, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19710, 2016 WL 659308, at *4. Accordingly, [*24]  Plaintiff's Motion to Amend is GRANTED with regard to his FMLA claim.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint be GRANTED. (Doc. 4). Provided the District Court adopts this Report and Recommendation, Plaintiff's Motion to Amend is GRANTED. (Doc. 6).
SO ORDERED AND REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED, this 23 day of January, 2017.
