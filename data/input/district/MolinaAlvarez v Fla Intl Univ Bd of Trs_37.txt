Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
THIS CAUSE came before the Court upon Defendants Florida International University ("FIU") Board of Trustees ("FIU Board") and Staff of Human Resources Department's ("HR Department") (together, "Defendants") Motion to Dismiss [D.E. 30].1 This matter was referred to the undersigned pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636 by the Honorable Jose E. Martinez, United States District Judge [D.E. 5]. For the reasons set forth below, the undersigned respectfully recommends that the Motion to Dismiss [D.E. 30] be GRANTED and the case be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
In his Amended Complaint for Employment Discrimination (hereafter, "Amended Complaint"), filed on November 7, 2018, Plaintiff Alexis Molina-Alvarez ("Plaintiff') claims that Defendants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), [*2]  42 U.S.C. § 12112, et seq., by failing to accommodate his disability, namely, herniated discs in his lower back, and subsequently terminating his employment. See Amended Complaint [D.E. 25].
The Amended Complaint alleges:
➢ Plaintiff was a Maintenance Support Worker at FIU in the Campus Services Department, which was responsible for important events.
➢ On May 5, 2015, Plaintiff was seriously injured at work while moving a large pool table.
➢ On May 8, 2015, Plaintiff was restricted to no lifting, pulling or pushing more than 30 pounds. On May 11, 2015, Plaintiff notified Defendants of his restrictions and that he was experiencing lower back pain.
➢ After notifying Defendants of his restrictions, Plaintiff was ordered to help his co-workers move heavy furniture on multiple occasions.
➢ On May 14, 2015, Plaintiff's supervisor ordered him to stop working and to go home until the doctor lifted Plaintiff's lifting restrictions.
➢ Plaintiff could not walk or stand up for more than 10 minutes; could not sleep more than 4-5 hours due to spinal discomfort and pain; and could not work normally.
➢ He was diagnosed with a permanent impairment rating of 7 percent and permanent heavy work restrictions [*3]  due to his injuries.
➢ On December 29, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a request for an accommodation. In response to his request, FIU's Assistant Director of Benefits Administration told Plaintiff to complete two additional forms and to contact the Equal Opportunity Program and Diversity ("EOPD") Coordinator. Plaintiff successfully completed this step.
➢ On January 26, 2016, Plaintiff's employment was terminated.
➢ Before Plaintiff was terminated, he completed a functional capacity test which stated that he was able to lift 35 pounds.
➢ Plaintiffs job description required him to be able to lift 70 pounds, but, in practice, he would be required to set up tables and chairs with his co-workers.
➢ One of Plaintiff's former co-workers, Dennis Curbelo ("Mr. Curbelo"), who is married to an assistant in the HR Department, also sustained injuries during a work accident; but he was accommodated by being transferred to a different position. Plaintiff was not given a similar opportunity, probably because of his age or because he did not have relatives or powerful friends at FIU.
➢ Defendants discriminated against Plaintiff by strictly enforcing the job description against him but not against Mr. Curbelo. [*4] 
Id.
Plaintiff also attached to the Amended Complaint a letter dated January 26, 2016 to Plaintiff from FIU' s Executive Director Physical Plant, Facilities Administration (hereafter, "Termination Letter"). Id. at 15. The Termination Letter stated:
On December 22, 2015, we received the Worker's Compensation Notification indicating you reached your Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI) with a Permanent Impairment Rating (PIR) of 7% and permanent work restrictions. These restrictions prohibit you from performing the essential functions of your position as Maintenance Support Worker within the Campus Services Department.
Regrettably, due to your inability to return to your position and perform the essential functions of your position, the University has no option but to separate your employment effective today, January 26, 2016.
Id.
On November 21, 2018, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that the Amended Complaint failed to state a claim [D.E. 30]. On November 23, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Response [D.E. 32]. Defendants filed a Reply on November 30, 2018 [D.E. 35].

APPLICABLE LAW
Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (hereafter, "Rule 12(b)(6)"), a party may move to dismiss a complaint for "failure to state a claim upon which [*5]  relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, "[t]he [c]ourt does not view each fact in isolation . . . but considers the complaint in its entirety." Leader Glob. Sols. LLC v. Tradeco Infraestructura, S.A. DE C.V., 155 F. Supp. 3d 1310, 1315 (S.D. Fla. 2016) (citing Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007)). A "complaint must allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim to relief." Id. (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)). A claim is facially plausible "when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "[C]onclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal." Lowe v. Delta Air Lines Inc., 730 F. App'x 724, 728 (11th Cir. 2018). When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the court views the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accepts the plaintiff's factual allegations as true. Leader Glob. Sols., 155 F. Supp. 3d at 1315. The pleadings of pro se litigants are entitled to less stringent scrutiny than those filed by attorneys. Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998).
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he: (1) is disabled; (2) is a "qualified individual," namely, one who is able to perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) was subjected to discrimination because of his disability. [*6]  Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2016) (citations omitted); McKane v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., 363 F. App'x 679, 681 (11th Cir. 2010). A disability is defined as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." Cash v. Smith, 231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)).
After establishing that he is disabled, a plaintiff must show "that he can perform the essential functions of his job without any accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000). An accommodation is reasonable only if it allows the plaintiff to perform the essential functions of his job. Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). "[E]ssential functions are the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform." Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 927 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir. 2007)). Courts must consider the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, "and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1257.
Discrimination under the ADA includes an employer's failure to make a reasonable accommodation to the known physical or [*7]  mental limitations of the disabled employee. Mason v. United Parcel Serv. Co. Inc, 674 F. App'x 943, 951 (11th Cir. 2017). In failure to accommodate cases, the plaintiff bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation. Billups v. Emerald Coast Utilities Auth., 714 F. App'x 929, 933 (11th Cir. 2017). To adequately state a claim of failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must allege that he has made a specific request for accommodation. Avena v. Imperial Salon & Spa, Inc., 740 F. App'x 679, 682 (11th Cir. 2018). A disabled employee is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation. McKane, 363 F. App'x at 681. An accommodation that eliminates an essential function of a job is unreasonable. Anderson, 379 F. App' x. at 928 (finding that a request for forklift work only was unreasonable where lifting was an essential function of the job).
Examples of reasonable accommodations listed within the ADA include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." Lucas, 257 F.3d. at 1256 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B)). Reassignment is only a reasonable accommodation if there is an available position for which the plaintiff is qualified. Reed v. Heil Co., 206 F.3d 1055, 1062 (11th Cir. 2000). The ADA does not require an employer to "transform the position into another one by eliminating functions that are essential to the nature of [*8]  the job as it exists." Mason, 674 F. App'x at 951 (finding that the plaintiff did not establish a prima facie case under the ADA where she could not perform the lifting requirements of her position with or without reasonable accommodation); Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260 (rejecting a plaintiff's claim that the employer should have restructured the position at issue by eliminating certain physical requirements). The ADA provides no cause of action for an employer's failure to investigate possible accommodations, and an employer's failure to investigate does not relieve the plaintiff of the burden of proving the availability of a reasonable accommodation. McKane, 363 F. App'x at 681.

DISCUSSION
Initially, the undersigned notes that as an entity that cannot sue or be sued in its own name, the HR Department is not subject to service of process. See Fla. Stat. § 1001.72(1). As such, Plaintiff's claims against the HR Department must be dismissed with prejudice, and the undersigned proceeds to address Plaintiffs claims as against the FIU Board only.
Liberally construing the claims in Plaintiffs Amended Complaint, he appears to allege that FIU failed to accommodate his disability—herniated discs in his lower back—and that FIU fired him because he was unable to perform the lifting requirements of [*9]  the position. See Amended Complaint [D.E. 25]. To state a plausible claim for relief under the ADA, Plaintiff must plead sufficient facts showing that he is disabled; was able to perform the essential functions of the Maintenance Support Worker position with or without reasonable accommodation; and that FIU failed to provide a reasonable accommodation or terminated him because of his disability. Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1255; McKane, 363 F. App'x at 681.
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs herniated discs are not a disability. However, Plaintiff alleged that, due to this impairment, he could not walk or stand up for more than 10 minutes; could not sleep more than 4-5 hours due to spinal discomfort and pain; and could not work normally. See Amended Complaint [D.E. 25 at 11]. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, he has adequately alleged that his condition substantially limits one or more major life activities. Thus, for the purposes of the instant Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff has sufficiently pled that he is disabled under the ADA. See Cash, 231 F.3d at 1305.
Regarding whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of his job with or without a reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff alleged that his job required him to be able to lift [*10]  at least 70 pounds, but that he was unable to lift more than 35 pounds. See Amended Complaint [D.E. 25 at 8]. Plaintiff attempted to characterize the 70-pound lifting requirement as a non-essential function of his job by alleging that, in practice, the work involved setting up regular-sized tables and chairs along with a co-worker. Id. at 8-9. However, he also alleged that he was directed to move heavy furniture and that when he was injured he had been moving a pool table. Id. at 10. Thus, given these additional allegations and that the job description explicitly included the lifting requirement, the undersigned finds that the ability to lift at least 70 pounds was an essential function of the Maintenance Support Worker position. See Holly, 492 F.3d at 1257 (holding that a job description constitutes evidence of the essential functions of the job). Moreover, to the extent that Plaintiff alleges that he can perform the lifting requirement with the help of his co-workers, this contention is unavailing. See Mason, 674 F. App'x at 943 (finding the plaintiff's purported reliance on other employees to help her lift packages that exceeded her lifting capabilities was insufficient to establish that she could perform the essential functions of her job). Accordingly, [*11]  Plaintiff's admitted inability to perform an essential function of his job defeats his purported claims of disability discrimination.
Additionally, regarding Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim, he alleged that he submitted a request for an accommodation, but did not specify what the requested accommodation was. See Amended Complaint [D.E. 25 at 7]. This lack of specificity falls short of the pleading requirements of an ADA claim. See Avena, 740 F. App'x at 682.; Plaintiff did imply that he should have been reassigned to another position like Mr. Curbelo purportedly was. See Amended Complaint [D.E. 25 at 8]. However, he failed to identify an available position for which he was qualified. Id.; see also Reed, 206 F.3d at 1062. Moreover, the ADA does not require FIU to transform the Maintenance Support Worker position into another one by eliminating the 70-pound lifting requirement. See Mason, 674 F. App'x at 951; Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260. Further, Plaintiff attributed the difference in how he was treated compared to Mr. Curbelo, not to his disability, but rather to "probably [his] age" or because he did not have "relatives or powerful friends inside FIU." See Amended Complaint [D.E. 25 at 8].2 Thus, the Amended Complaint lacks sufficient facts to support a failure to accommodate [*12]  claim.
As to Plaintiff's discriminatory termination claim, in addition to failing to adequately allege that he is a qualified individual, the Amended Complaint does not allege that Defendants terminated him because of his disability. See Booth v. City of Roswell, 754 F. App'x 834, 838 (11th Cir. 2018) ("Because Booth did not allege any facts to support his allegation that he was `terminated because he was an undesirable employee because of his disability,' the district court did not plainly err in dismissing his disparate treatment claim.") (citations omitted). Rather, Plaintiff attached the Termination Letter to the Amended Complaint, which stated that Plaintiff was terminated because he was unable to perform the essential functions of his position. See Termination Letter [DI. 25 at 15]. This is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason that cannot support Plaintiff's discriminatory termination claim. See Perry v. City of Avon Park, Fla., 662 F. App'x 831, 837 (11th Cir. 2016) (noting that termination of an employee because she was unable to perform the essential functions of her position was a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination).
Accordingly, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Moreover, because further amendments would not cure Plaintiff's [*13]  inability to perform the 70-pound lifting requirement, the undersigned finds that the dismissal should be with prejudice. See Louis v. Seaboard Marine, Ltd., Inc., No. 10-22719-CIV, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 200526, 2012 WL 13071863, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 27, 2012) (finding that dismissal with prejudice is appropriate where amendment would be futile); Andrews v. City of Hartford, 15-CV-00684-BJR-SRW, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101479, 2016 WL 4154685, at *4 (M.D. Ala. Aug. 3, 2016), aff'd, 700 F. App'x. 924 (11th Cir. 2017) (dismissing with prejudice the plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination for failure to establish a prima facie case under the ADA).
The undersigned's recommendation of dismissal with prejudice renders Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, filed on February 22, 2019, moot [D.E. 43]. Nevertheless, the undersigned notes that the grounds upon which the Motion for Summary Judgment are based are the same grounds as the instant Motion to Dismiss. The only material addition to the factual record is correspondence concerning an offer by FIU to employ Plaintiff in a full-time desk position, which Plaintiff rejected. See Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [D.E. 44 at 2-3]. Plaintiff's rejection reinforces the undersigned's conclusion that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual. See Llanes v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 46 F. Supp. 2d 1300, 1309 (S.D. Fla. 1997) ("Although an employee is not required to [*14]  accept an offered accommodation, 'if such individual rejects a reasonable accommodation . . . the individual will not be considered a qualified individual with a disability.") (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9), aff'd, 141 F.3d 1189 (11th Cir. 1998).

RECOMMENDATION
Based on the foregoing considerations, the undersigned RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDS that the Motion to Dismiss [D.E. 30] be GRANTED and the case be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
Pursuant to Local Magistrate Judge Rule 4(b), the parties have fourteen days from the date of this Report and Recommendation to file written objections, if any, with the Honorable Jose E. Martinez, United States District Judge. Failure to file timely objections may bar the parties from attacking the factual findings contained herein on appeal. See Resolution Tr. Corp. v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., 996 F.2d 1144, 1149 (11th Cir. 1993). Further, "failure to object in accordance with the provisions of [28 U.S.C.] § 636(b)(1) waives the right to challenge on appeal the district court's order based on unobjected-to factual and legal conclusions." See 11th Cir. R. 3-1 (I.O.P. - 3).
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED in Chambers at Miami, Florida this 15th day of May, 2019.
