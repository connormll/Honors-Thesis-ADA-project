Opinion



ORDER
WO
Pending before the Court is Defendant G&K Services Inc.'s ("G&K") Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 66). The motion has been fully briefed1 and neither party has requested oral argument. For the reasons that follow, the Motion will be granted.

I. MATERIAL FACTS2
G&K is a Minnesota corporation in the business of leasing and laundering textile products to industrial customers around the country. (Doc. 66 at 2). On May 6, 2011, G&K hired Plaintiff Brandy Williams ("Williams") as a Human Resources Representative ("HRR") for its Phoenix, Arizona plant location. (Id.; Doc. 76 ¶ 1).
In July 2012, G&K's Human Resources ("HR") Department leaders started a restructuring project to better align the work of HR employees [*2]  to the needs of the company's business. (Doc. 67 ¶ 3). Under the new structure, traditional HR functions like hiring processing and payroll were consolidated at G&K's corporate office in Minnesota. (Id. ¶ 4) Individual HR employees were then placed in positions specific to a particular expertise, e.g., Generalist, Talent Management/Recruiting, Employee Relations, and Compensation. (Id.)
Williams was out on FMLA leave for the birth of her child when the HR restructuring project began in July 2012. (Doc. 67 ¶ 1). She returned to work on October 3, 2012, but soon began to experience complications related to her pregnancy. (Doc. 76 ¶ 8). Because she was ineligible for more FMLA time, she requested and was granted non-FMLA medical leave from December 12, 2012 through January 11, 2013. (Id.) Sometime in December 2012, Williams says she verbally asked Rachel Siggerud ("Siggerud"), the Regional HR Director for G&K's Northwest Region, to "continue to work with my medical providers to attend doctors' appointments or testing as necessary," a request G&K found acceptable. (Doc. 67 ¶ 14). Siggerud told Williams that upon her return to work she should reflect her unavailability for these appointments [*3]  on her work calendar as an unspecified "meeting"; Williams sometimes calendared these appointments on her work computer, and when she did, she did so as Siggerud suggested. (Doc. 67 ¶ 23; Doc. 77 ¶ 23). Williams does not recall using the words "ADA accommodation" at this time and handling requests for ADA accommodations were not part of Siggerud's typical job duties. (Doc. 67 ¶ 14; Doc. 76 ¶ 31). Williams provided G&K with medical documentation on January 16, 2013 showing she was able to return to work with no medical limitations. (Doc. 67 ¶ 7). Williams has no complaints with regard to her July 2012 FMLA leave or December 2012 non-FMLA leave. (Doc. 67 ¶ 6).
Just after starting her non-FMLA protected leave in December 2012, G&K informed Williams that HR was being reorganized. (Doc. 76-1, Ex. O). She was told that layoffs had been made but that she was being offered a new position as an HR Generalist for the Northwest region, a position that would start on February 23, 2013. (Doc. 76 ¶ 9). Two other HR employees were also to serve as HR Generalists for the Northwest region: Janelle Bonacua ("Bonacua") in California and Kaela Ellison ("Ellison") in Minnesota. (Doc. 66 at 3). The Northwest [*4]  region was the only one of G&K's regions that was staffed by three HR Generalists; all of G&K's other regions were staffed by two HR Generalists. (Doc. 67 ¶ 10; Doc. 77 ¶ 10).
While she was an HRR, Williams's supervisor had been Jacob Briscoe ("Briscoe"), a manager at the Phoenix plant. (Doc. 76 ¶ 2). Because of the reorganization, Briscoe was no longer Williams' direct supervisor; instead, Williams, Bonacua, and Ellison, were to report directly to Siggerud. (Id. ¶¶ 11, 14). Siggerud was physically located at G&K's corporate office in Minnesota. (Id. ¶ 15). Williams therefore did not have a direct supervisor on-site in Phoenix in her role as HR Generalist. (Doc. 76 ¶ 17). Like her old position, Williams did not have a set schedule in this new position. (Doc. 67 ¶ 13). Her duties, however, changed and she was now responsible for seven other territories in G&K's Northwest Region in addition to Phoenix. (Doc. 76 ¶ 10). Some of Williams' old responsibilities shifted onto her former supervisor, Briscoe. (Doc. 76 ¶ 13).
Although all of Williams' verbal requests to take non-FMLA leave time for her medical appointments were approved, from May to June of 2013, Williams felt that Siggerud was [*5]  getting frustrated with the time she was taking to attend appointments. (Doc. 76 ¶ 24). During their weekly one-on-one meetings, Siggerud would ask Williams questions like "How long is this going to last?"; "Do you know how much longer you will have to go to the appointments?"; "Have they figured out specifically what is wrong with you?"; and say, "This is happening a lot." (Id.)
In June 2013, Siggerud spoke with Williams regarding her performance in her new role as HR Generalist. (Doc. 67 ¶ 15).3 Siggerud told Williams that the Phoenix managers, including Briscoe, thought she was ineffective and not engaged because there had been occasions when she had not timely returned phone calls, shown up for meetings, or responded to emails. (Doc. 67-3, Ex. I).
On July 8, 2013, Williams sent Ms. Siggerud a formal request for an Americans with Disabilities ("ADA") accommodation in which she said she would "need time away from the business to attend regularly scheduled medical appointments and counseling with my current mental health provider. These appointments can be scheduled first thing in the morning or at the end of the day to hopefully not interfere with the daily business operation." (Doc. [*6]  67 ¶ 18). Williams copied Nikki Kietzer ("Kietzer"), a benefits specialist with G&K, on the letter. (Doc. 67, Ex. K). Siggerud also forwarded the request to Marie Smith ("Smith"), an employee in G&K's Employee Relations department.4 (Doc. 67 ¶ 30). In light of the nature of her ADA request, Siggerud suggested Williams apply for intermittent FMLA leave and Williams did so. (Doc. 76 ¶ 35). Because her initial request did not contain the required medical certification, Smith asked Williams to provide as much. (Doc. 67 ¶ 30). Williams provided this documentation on August 5, 2013 and Williams' FMLA intermittent leave to attend medical appointments in accordance with her requested ADA accommodation was officially approved on that day. (Doc. 67 ¶ 42).
Siggerud continued to raise concerns [*7]  with regard to Williams' engagement in July 2013. Williams, in turn, continued to expressed her concern about her relationship with the Phoenix management team, which included her old supervisor, Briscoe. (Doc. 67 ¶ 31). Williams told Siggerud that Briscoe believed Williams was now serving as an "HR Cop" or "HR Auditor" and resented her for having to do work that Williams had been responsible for in her old role as HHR. (Doc. 77 ¶ 31).
Williams and Siggerud had a telephone conversation on July 17, 2013 that was recorded. During the call, Williams sought clarity on others' perceptions of Williams "not being engaged or [her] not communicating with everyone." (Doc. 76-1, Ex. L at 13:1-2). Williams thought the perception that she was not engaged or available existed in part because after her change in position, management in Phoenix thought she was no longer completely dedicated to the Phoenix plant and now had to support other locations. (Doc. 77 ¶ 35). Williams also believed that the fact that Briscoe had moved her office space contributed to the perception that she was unavailable, (Doc. 67 ¶ 36) and expressed concern that the perception was linked to her need to attend her medical appointments. [*8]  (Doc. 76 ¶ 25). Siggerud assured Williams these perceptions were not connected with her need to attend medical appointments because Siggerud was the only one that knew of Williams' needs. (Doc. 67 ¶ 21; Doc. 76-1, Ex. L, 13:15-14:3). Williams agreed that no one else, including Mr. Briscoe, knew of her need to attend these appointments. (Doc. 67 ¶ 21; Doc. 76-1, Ex. L, 13:15-14:3). Siggerud told Williams that people thought she was unavailable because she would accept meetings on her calendar and then not attend the meetings. (Doc. 67 ¶ 33). Siggerud said she was personally frustrated because Williams had occasionally failed to attend their weekly one-on-one meetings without prior notice. (Id. ¶ 34). The following exchange is demonstrative of how the parties were characterizing their respective discontent:
MS. WILLIAMS: So that's where I get to the -- to the point of feeling, like, I'm not wanted or needed here anymore because of the minor things that are coming up.
MS. SIGGERUD: So you're certainly wanted. And I, you know, I want you as a part of my team. But what I'm -- I'm hearing is that I don't know if you want it. And if you don't, it's not -- your passion's not here, your heart's [*9]  not in it, I get that. This job had changed an awful lot and it's not what everybody wants...And if that's where you're at, I'd like you to kinda think about it for the next couple of days. Because the staying close to you, holding you to the -- we gotta be on the calls, things like that, that's me trying to make sure that I'm close to you, so I can help make sure that you're on track. If that's not kinda what you're looking for, I can assure you it has absolutely nothing to do with any medical condition, you know, and I think it's a -- a little unfair to say that because we had the conversation about expectations before anything came up and -
MS. WILLIAMS: What do you mean before anything came up? I've been dealing with these issues since the birth of my son. Since I came back.
MS. SIGGERUD: And it's never been any kind of an issue.
MS. WILLIAMS: None of the things with - None of the things or the issues with me came up until about two months ago.
MS. SIGGERUD: So the -- your medical concerns have been ongoing and it's not changed.
MS. WILLIAMS: Right.
MS. SIGGERUD: And so what came up about a month ago is a performance conversation. It had nothing to do with anything related to your medical [*10]  condition. It has everything to do with performance and expectations.
MS. WILLIAMS: But the performance was around you getting the feedback of the perception that I wasn't here.
MS. SIGGERUD: That's not the only thing that was part of that conversation. That was one small piece of it. And so that's kinda the --
MS. WILLIAMS: I do want to be here, Rachael, I do...But like I said, I - I'm not gonna continue to be stressed or to deal with minor, you know, issues if it's not gonna be beneficial to G & K or to myself.
MS. SIGGERUD: Well, as far as being beneficial to G & K, these are things that are important. The things that we have talked about, those are important. Being a good partner, being on time, meeting commitments, those are extremely important. And if that's kinda not where your head's at and you say, gosh, I would rather have a different type of, you know, work environment. I'd rather have a different kinda schedule, you know, I understand that. You know, I'd love to have you here, but if you say, gosh, this isn't the right thing for me, let me know.
MS. WILLIAMS: No, I don't want this to be put back off on me because I haven't expressed that I didn't want to be here. I've never [*11]  expressed an issue with being here. An issue, you know, with not wanting to be in HR. I feel like this issue has come up and was brought to me, so that's why I'm trying to make sure I wanted here? And if so, are things going to continue to improve?
MS. SIGGERUD: Brandy, I just told you that you're wanted here, and whether they improve or not is up to you.
(Doc. 76-1, Ex. L at 23:6-26:17). When Siggerud encouraged Williams to copy her on emails and work with her to help improve others' perceptions of her, Williams went on to tell Siggerud that she felt micromanaged in her new position and that "two years before that I never had to do that." (Doc. 76-1, Ex. L at 33:2-3). Siggerud responded:
But the job wasn't the same, Brandy. So the activities that we're trying to do now, of -- we're not getting them done, because people aren't -- they're not making it to meetings, they're too busy, they're whatever, that's what your job is now. Before your job was different. It was, we're doing payroll, we're doing benefits, we're hiring people, we're recruiting. It wasn't the same types of activities. And so it's -- it wasn't so based on other people.
(Id. at 34:4-13). She went on to say that she wanted [*12]  to help and wanted Williams on her team, but if Williams did not think it was what she wanted, they would "come up with a transition plan....We can either look for something else within G & K, I can help you with a transition plan to find something else outside of G & K, but I'll work with ya to figure it out." (Id. at 34:15-25). The parties agreed that they would meet with Briscoe the following week to "put[] together a plan." (Id. at 35:19-22).
On or about July 26, 2013, Williams says Siggerud called her to informally let her know Williams had been granted intermittent FMLA and that she was placing Williams in a temporary position on the Talent Acquisition recruiting team for two or three months, effective July 29, 2013. (Doc. 76-1, Ex. O). In that role, Williams was to report to Talent Acquisition manager Michael Hammond ("Hammond"). (Doc. 76-1, Ex. O). Siggerud told Williams that she should not continue to perform her role as HR Generalist, but should focus on recruiting for Talent Acquisition. (Doc. 76-1, Ex. O). She also told Williams that they would discuss her future with G&K toward the end of her temporary role in Talent Acquisition. (Doc. 76-1, Ex. O).
Toward the end of her [*13]  temporary term with the Talent Acquisition team, on or about September 24, 2013, Siggerud and Eric McNaul ("McNaul"), G&K's Regional Vice President, met with Williams to inform her that she would not be returning to her position as HR Generalist because they had determined the region was overstaffed. (Doc. 76-1, Ex. O). She was also informed that she would not be offered a position as a recruiter on the Talent Acquisition team and that her employment with G&K was being terminated as of September 27, 2013. (Doc. 76 ¶ 49; Doc. 76-1, Ex. O).
After her termination, Williams saw a job posting that G&K had advertised for an HR Generalist. (Doc. 76 ¶ 82). However, G&K did not refill Williams' position in the Northwest region. (Doc. 67 ¶¶47, 49). In 2014, G&K also dismissed Bonacua and has staffed the Northwest region with one HR Generalist since her dismissal. (Id.)
Williams thereafter filed a complaint with the EEOC. Having exhausted her administrative remedies, she filed a complaint in this Court on September 1, 2015. (Doc. 1). Williams' Complaint alleges counts for interference and retaliation under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") (Counts 1 and 2); failure to accommodate and wrongful [*14]  termination under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") (Count 3); intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count 4); and declarative and injunctive relief (Counts 5 and 6). On September 23, 2016, G&K sought summary judgment on all the claims in the complaint.

II. Summary Judgment Standards
A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense-on which summary judgment is sought. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A court must grant summary judgment if the pleadings and supporting documents, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, show "that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Id.; see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Jesinger v. Nevada Fed. Credit Union, 24 F.3d 1127, 1130 (9th Cir. 1994). Substantive law determines which facts are material. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); see also Jesinger, 24 F.3d at 1130. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. The dispute must also be genuine, that is, the evidence must be "such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id.; see Jesinger, 24 F.3d at 1130.
A principal purpose of summary judgment is "to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323-24. Summary [*15]  judgment is appropriate against a party who "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Id. at 322. The moving party need not disprove matters on which the opponent has the burden of proof at trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. The party opposing summary judgment may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the party's pleadings, but must set forth "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (1963) (amended 2010)); Brinson v. Linda Rose Joint Venture, 53 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir. 1995). The non-movant's bare assertions, standing alone, are insufficient to create a material issue of fact and defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48.
Moreover, the evidence presented by the parties must be admissible, Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(e), and conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See Nelson v. Pima Community College, 83 F.3d 1075, 1081-82 (9th Cir.1996) ("[M]ere allegation and speculation do not create a factual dispute for purposes of summary judgment").

III. DISCUSSION
In its motion, G&K argues that Williams' FMLA, ADA and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims fail as a matter of law. G&K specifically contends [*16]  that Williams cannot meet her burden of showing that (1) she was retaliated against for opposing any unlawful practices; (2) her FMLA leave was a negative factor in G&K's decision to terminate her; (3) G&K failed to engage in the interactive process and reasonably accommodate her disability under the ADA; or (4) G&K's conduct rose to the level of outrageousness necessary to provide a basis for recovery under an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.

A. Williams' FMLA "Retaliation" Claim (Count 2)
As an initial matter, it is important to distinguish and clarify the difference between the FMLA interference claim Williams alleges in Count 1, and the FMLA retaliation claim she alleges in Count 2.
The FMLA sets forth two types of claims, one for interference with FMLA rights in 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1), and the other for retaliation for opposing practices in FMLA 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2) and (b). See Gressett v. Central Ariz. Water Cons. Dist., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112821, 2014 WL 4053404 (D. Ariz. Aug. 14, 2014) (explaining the differences between the two claims). These claims are often confused.5 The Ninth Circuit, however, has clarified that a claim alleging that an employer has taken adverse action against an employee for the employee's exercise of his FMLA rights is properly classified as an interference claim under 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1) and not as a retaliation [*17]  claim under 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2) or (b). See Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc., 259 F.3d 1112, 1124 (9th Cir. 2001). Retaliation claims under 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2) and (b) "[b]y their plain meaning...do not cover visiting negative consequences on an employee simply because he has used FMLA leave." Id. That circumstance describes an interference claim and not a retaliation claim, even if the syntax used includes language that the employer "retaliated" or "discriminated" against the employee. Id. The claim becomes a retaliation claim under Section 2615(a)(2) only "where an employee is punished for opposing unlawful practices by the employer." Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1136 (9th Cir. 2003) (emphasis in original). See also Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1124 (noting that a retaliation claim can also arise under Section 2615(b), "which prohibits discrimination against any individual for instituting or participating in FMLA proceedings or inquiries").
With those distinctions in mind, it is apparent that William's Complaint does not state a claim for FMLA retaliation. Other than the allegation that Defendants terminated Williams for exercising her FMLA rights (Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 64-65, 73-75), there is no allegation that G&K either punished Williams for opposing unlawful practices, or discriminated against her for instituting or participating in FMLA proceedings or inquiries. Williams' retaliation claim in Count 2 [*18]  does not use the terms "discriminate" or "retaliate"; instead, Williams simply alleges that "Defendant willfully terminated Plaintiff's employment because she requested and took leave under the FMLA." (Doc. 1 at ¶ 74). Under Ninth Circuit precedent, Williams is alleging an interference claim under 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1) and not a retaliation claim under 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2) or (b). Accordingly, the Court will construe the complaint as one claim for interference under the FMLA and grant G&K's motion for summary judgment on Count 2 of Williams' Complaint for failure to state a FMLA retaliation claim.
The Court now turns to Williams' FMLA interference claim.

B. Williams' FMLA Interference Claim (Count 1)
Williams' first cause of action alleges that, in violation of the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1), G&K interfered with her right to take protected leave when it terminated her employment on September 27, 2013 after granting her intermittent FMLA leave on August 5, 2013.
The FMLA entitles an "eligible employee" to twelve workweeks of leave during a twelve month period because of a "serious health condition" making her unable to perform the functions of her employment. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). 29 C.F.R. § 825.202(a) provides that "FMLA leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule under [*19]  certain circumstances," and "include[s] leave taken on an occasional basis for medical appointments..." The FMLA, however, "does not entitle the employee to any rights, benefits, or positions they would not have been entitled to had they not taken leave." Liu, 347 F.3d at 1132 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(3)(B)). Similarly, 29 C.F.R. § 825.216(a) provides:
An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave...For example: (1) If an employee is laid off during the course of taking FMLA leave and employment is terminated, the employer's responsibility to continue FMLA leave, maintain group health plan benefits and restore the employee cease[s] at the time the employee is laid off...
Section 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1) of the FMLA states that it is "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise any right provided under [the FMLA]." Courts in the Ninth Circuit enforce an employee's right to non-inference to FMLA benefits by prohibiting employers from "us[ing] the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions." Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1122 (alteration and emphasis omitted) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c)). In the Ninth Circuit, interference [*20]  claims under the FMLA do not proceed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1136. Instead, to prevail on a claim that FMLA leave was impermissibly considered in a decision to terminate, an employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that taking the protected leave was a negative factor in the termination decision. Id. This showing can be made using direct or circumstantial evidence, or both. Id.; Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1125.
Defendant argues that Williams cannot show any evidence that her intermittent FMLA leave played a factor in the decision to terminate her. Defendant contends that undisputed evidence shows that Plaintiff was legitimately terminated as part of a necessary downsizing of the HR Generalists in the Northwest region, and because in contrast to the other HR Generalists that were retained, Plaintiff failed to satisfactorily perform her job duties and was overall less qualified.6 Williams contends that the "overwhelming amount of evidence" shows that G&K terminated her "because [G&K] was frustrated and upset that [Williams] had formally requested and was taking intermittent leave to attend to her medical conditions," not because of any performance issues. (Doc. 75 at 9). She [*21]  also argues that the proximity of the timing between her request for FMLA-leave and the decision to terminate her creates an issue of triable fact that precludes summary judgment.
G&K has set forth specific reasons why Williams was selected for termination in September 2013: (1) G&K had determined that it was overstaffed with HR generalists for the Northwest region and it made sense to reduce the staffing such that one person would cover Minnesota and Phoenix, and another would handle California; and (2) unlike the other two HR Generalists in her region, G&K had conveyed performance concerns to Williams during the brief time she had held her new position, and in comparison to the others, she did not have as much experience in the HR field.
Williams first contends that G&K's proffered need to reduce its HR Generalist staff size in the Northwest region lacks credibility and thus raises triable issues of fact. In support of this, Williams states that after her termination, G&K advertised for an HR Generalist position, as evidenced by a screenshot for a HR Generalist in "MN-Minnetonka" dated February 12, 2014 she has submitted with her response. (Doc. 76 ¶ 82). However, when asked about [*22]  the job posting in her deposition, Williams explained that "MN-Minnetonka" would have been designated on all job postings for HR Generalists so "MN-Minnetonka" was not necessarily a designation of what region that position would serve. (Doc. 76-1, Ex. A at 257:1-14). As a result, she could not say that the job posting in the screenshot was for the Northwest region. (Id.; Doc. 67 ¶ 48). G&K, moreover, has put forth evidence showing that after Williams' termination, it also eliminated Bonacua's position and has since only staffed the Northwest region with one HR Generalist. (Doc. 67 ¶¶ 47, 49). Williams herself has repeatedly stated that she and the other HR Generalists were often "bored" in their positions and did not know what their exact role was. (Doc. 67 ¶ 45; Doc. 77 ¶ 45). In light of this evidence, Williams cannot raise a triable issue that G&K's need to reduce its staff in the Northwest region was illegitimate or pretextual. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48 (a non-movant's bare assertions, standing alone, are insufficient to create a material issue of fact).
Williams also says a triable issue exists as to G&K's professed concerns over her performance during her time as an HR Generalist. She says that G&K had [*23]  no basis to terminate her over poor job performance, as evidenced by the fact that (1) all three HR Generalists struggled in their positions (Doc. 76 ¶ 80); (2) there was no job descriptions for the HR Generalist position until April 2014 (Doc. 76 ¶ 84); and (3) she was never put on a PIP or written up during her employment at G&K (Doc. 76 ¶ 67-68). Importantly, however, Williams does not dispute that prior to her FMLA leave, both Briscoe and Siggerud had expressed concerns regarding Williams' responsiveness, her availability, that she had missed meetings, and that she was unaccounted for during certain times of the week. (Doc. 76 ¶¶ 63-65; Doc. 67-1, Ex. A at 159:17-19; Doc. 67-3, Ex. I). Williams also cannot dispute that Siggerud discussed these concerns with her in June and July of 2013, before her request for FMLA leave was granted on August 5, 2013, and even before her request was made on July 8, 2013. (Doc. 76 ¶ 38; Doc. 76-1, Ex. L; Doc. 67- 3, Ex. I). Indeed, there are recorded telephone calls from June 26, 2013 and July 17, 2013 between Williams and Siggerud that discuss these issues at length; both calls also reference past conversations about the same. (Doc. 76-1, Ex. L). [*24] 
Williams nonetheless construes Siggerud's criticism of her performance between May and July as evidence of Siggerud's frustration with Williams' need to take intermittent FMLA leave to attend medical appointments, a fact that infers that Williams' FMLA leave was a negative factor in G&K's decision to terminate her. The Court disagrees. Even assuming that Siggerud was frustrated with the time Williams was taking to attend these appointments, this argument entirely fails to take into account that (1) the absences for these appointments were non-FMLA protected, compare 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c) ("FMLA leave [cannot] be counted under no fault attendance policies"); (2) Williams' need to attend medical appointments (and take other non-FMLA leave) had existed since she had returned from maternity leave in October 2012 and G&K had never objected to or found issue with these requests (and even appears to have retained Williams while she was on non-FMLA leave despite other layoffs in the 2012 HR restructuring); and (3) that Siggerud was instructive in getting Williams the FMLA benefits that she was entitled to. (Doc. 76 ¶ 35). Where nothing in the factual record supports that G&K was ever opposed to or prevented Williams [*25]  from taking leave (FMLA or non-FMLA) to attend to her medical needs, Siggerud's feedback or frustration regarding Williams' lack of engagement between May and June 2013 does not suddenly evidence that G&K improperly considered Williams' August 2013 intermittent FMLA leave in her September 2013 termination. See Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1123 (explaining that FMLA's prohibition against an employer using FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions ensures that exercise of those protected rights are not chilled). Moreover, the Court declines to give Siggerud's mere knowledge of Williams' need to take intermittent leave under the FMLA determinative weight and agrees that "[s]omething more is needed to nudge mere knowledge of upcoming leave into the category of "a negative factor." Matthews v. Alhambra School Dist., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76731, 2009 WL 2734950, at *5 (D. Ariz. 2009) (finding that supervisor's "mere knowledge cannot bear the weight that [the employee] places on it, or else impending FMLA-protected leave could cloud all otherwise justified employer action"). There is simply no triable issue that Williams' performance problems were raised and discussed prior to her starting her FMLA leave on August 5, 2013. The Court declines to translate these independent problems into an FMLA-protected factor [*26]  simply because Williams subsequently requested intermittent FMLA leave.
Williams has also failed to present sufficient evidence that a triable issue exists regarding the performance of the other two HR Generalists in comparison to her. (See Doc. 76-1, Exs. F and G). Although Williams disputes that Ms. Bonacua had "extensive knowledge and expertise regarding California's complex employment laws" qualifications, she does not dispute that Bonacua had a California certification in HR (a test that Williams had attempted to take twice and failed) and that Bonacua had worked in California prior to her employment with G&K. (Doc. 67-1, Ex. A at 160-61). Moreover, she does not dispute that Ellison had unique experience in handling labor agreements in Minnesota that Williams did not. (Doc. 67 ¶ 46). Finally, Williams cannot point to any evidence that either of these employees had similar (or any) performance issues.
Accordingly, the question becomes whether the proximity in time between the decision to terminate and Williams' protected leave alone can raise a triable issue of whether G&K improperly considered Williams' FMLA leave in its decision. The record is somewhat incomplete with regard to [*27]  when the decision to terminate Williams was made. The Court, however, adopts Williams' proffered date, and for purposes of this motion finds that the decision to terminate her was made sometime in August 2013, after she started her intermittent FMLA leave on August 5, 2013. These dates are unquestionable close in time. The Ninth Circuit has found that proximity in time between when a plaintiff takes FMLA-protected leave and the decision to terminate may provide some evidence that the employee's FMLA leave was a negative factor in the decision. Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1137. But this proximity should not be considered "without regard to its factual setting," and standing alone, is likely insufficient to establish a connection. Coszalter v. City of Salem, 320 F.3d 968, 978 (9th Cir. 2003) (refusing to adopt a "bright line rule" about timing between retaliatory action and exercise of protected activity); Fleming v. IASIS Healthcare Corp., 151 F.Supp.3d 1043, 1055 (D. Ariz. 2015) (rejecting plaintiff's theory that timing between events is enough to create a triable issue of material fact). Indeed, where the factual circumstances "dispel any inference created by the timing of [an employee's] termination," an employer may be entitled to summary judgment on an FMLA interference claim. Matthews, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76731, 2009 WL 2734950, at *5.
As discussed above, under the circumstances in which Williams was [*28]  terminated, the mere proximity in time between Williams' FMLA leave and G&K's decision to terminate her cannot alone establish that a triable issue exists as to whether G&K improperly factored her approved FMLA leave into account when deciding to terminate her position. It is well-settled that an employer is not liable for "interfering" with an employee's leave when the employee would have been terminated regardless of the leave. See 29 C.F.R. 825.216(a) ("An employee has no greater right to reinstatement... than if the employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave period"); Throneberry v. McGehee Desha County Hosp., 403 F.3d 972, 979 (8th Cir. 2005) ("As long as an employer can show a lawful reason, i.e., a reason unrelated to an employee's exercise of FMLA rights, for not restoring an employee on FMLA leave to her position, the employer will be justified to interfere with an employee's FMLA leave rights"); Geromanos v. Columbia Univ., 322 F.Supp.2d 420, 429 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) ("FMLA is not a shield to protect employees form legitimate disciplinary action by their employers if their performance is lacking in some manner unrelated to their FMLA leave"). Here, the evidence shows that G&K had a business need to reduce the number of HR Generalists in the Northwest region and out of the three HR Generalists, Williams was only one with [*29]  performance issues and was generally less qualified than the other two. Under these circumstances, G&K had legitimate reasons for terminating Williams' employment, and even assuming that the decision was made during or close in time to Williams' FMLA leave, that fact, alone, does not tend to show that Williams' FMLA leave was a factor in G&K's decision. See e.g., Smith v. Diffee Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., 298 F.3d 955, 960 (10th Cir. 2002) (("[A]n employee who requests FMLA leave" has no "greater protection against his...employment being terminated for reasons not related to his...FMLA request than he...did before submitting the request."). The factual background as to when the decision was made "dispel[s] any inference" that the timing of Williams' request for FMLA leave was a factor in the decision. Matthews, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76731, 2009 WL 2734950, at *5. The Court will therefore grant G&K's motion for summary judgment of Williams' FMLA interference claim.

C. Williams' ADA Failure to Accommodate and Termination Claim (Count 3)
Williams contends that G&K violated the ADA by (1) failing to reasonably accommodate her disability and (2) by terminating her because of that disability. These claims cannot survive summary judgment.

1. Reasonable Accommodation
The ADA provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate [*30]  against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability...." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Discrimination includes not only the unequal treatment of a disabled employee but also a failure to make "reasonable accommodations" for that employee. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112(b)(4), (b)(5)(A). Once an employer becomes aware of an employee's need for accommodation, it must engage in an "interactive process" with the employee to identify and implement reasonable accommodations. Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001). The interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees, and neither side can delay or obstruct the process. Barnett v. U.S. Air, 228 F.3d 1105, 1114-15 (9th Cir. 2000).
Williams has offered no evidence that G&K failed to engage in the interactive process in good faith that supports her failure to accommodate claim. To the contrary, the evidence shows the opposite. Here, the record indicates that from December 2012 through August 2013, Siggerud and Williams had on-going conversations regarding Williams' need to attend medical appointments - the accommodation that Williams states she needed. Moreover, at each occasion, G&K granted Williams' requests for time off to attend medical appointments. (Doc. 67 ¶ 19, 43-44). There is no triable issue [*31]  that G&K failed to engage in the interactive process with Williams.

2. Unlawful Discharge
"To prevail on a claim of unlawful discharge under the ADA, the plaintiff must establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability and that the employer terminated him because of his disability." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1137 ("Unlike a simply failure to accommodate claim, an unlawful discharge claim requires a showing that the employer terminated the employee because of his disability"). If Williams establishes her prima facie case, the burden shifts to G&K to provide a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision. Mustafa v. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist., 157 F.3d 1169, 1175 (9th Cir. 1998). If G&K disclaims any reliance on a discriminatory reason for the termination, the burden shifts back to Williams to show that G&K's reasons are actually pretextual for disability discrimination. Id.
Williams relies on "essentially the same reasons discussed herein in connection with Plaintiff's FMLA claims" to demonstrate that she was terminated because of her disability. (Doc. 75 at 14). The Court assumes, without finding, that Williams has met her prima facie burden. However, as discussed infra, G&K has offered several nondiscriminatory reasons why it terminated Williams and Williams [*32]  has not met her burden of showing these reasons were pretextual. See Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1094 (9th Cir. 2001) (finding plaintiff's evidence of disability discrimination sufficient for prima facie case but insufficient to raise triable issue of pretext). Summary judgment will thus be granted as to Williams' ADA discrimination claims.

D. Williams' Claim for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (Count 4)
Williams' claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress also does not survive summary judgment. To establish a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress under Arizona law, a plaintiff must establish (1) conduct that is capable of being characterized as "extreme and outrageous"; (2) conduct that is causally connected to the emotional distress; and (3) that plaintiff's emotional distress is severe. Watts v. Golden Age Nursing Home, 127 Ariz. 255, 619 P.2d 1032, 1035 (Ariz. 1980) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts ("Restatement") § 46). The conduct necessary to sustain an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim "falls at the very extreme edge of the spectrum of possible conduct." Id. (citing Restatement § 46, cmt. d).
G&K argues that the conduct alleged in Williams' complaint does not arise to the level of outrageousness necessary to provide a basis for recovery under her intentional infliction [*33]  of emotional distress claim. The Court agrees, but need not undergo an extensive analysis of this argument. The conduct underlying Williams' claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is G&K's alleged discrimination and unlawful discharge of Williams. Because the Court has found that G&K's termination of Williams was not discriminatory or unlawful, Williams cannot successful argue that a triable issue exists with regard to whether this conduct is "outrageous." The Court therefore grants summary judgment in favor of G&K on Williams' intentional infliction of emotional distress claim as well.
In accordance with the above discussion,
IT IS ORDERED that Defendant G&K's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 66) is granted.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant G&K's Motion to Exclude the Expert Report of Dr. Caren B. Goldberg (Doc. 65) is denied as moot.
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that the Clerk shall enter judgment in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff. The Clerk is respectfully asked to terminate this case.
Dated this 30th day of March, 2018.
