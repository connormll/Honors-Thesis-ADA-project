MEMORANDUM & ORDER REGARDING MOTION TO DISMISS

I. INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Sandra Lee initiated this employment action in Los Angeles Superior Court in October 2008 against defendants American Red Cross Blood Services Southern California Region ("Red Cross") and Plaintiff's former supervisors, Angie Turner, Kim Qua, and George Garratty (collectively, "Supervisory Defendants"). Defendants subsequently removed the action to this Court on December 12, 2008. After the Court dismissed former plaintiffs Sean Niles and Monique Madrid for improper joinder (2/10/2009 Order (Docket No. 10) at 2), defendants filed the motion to dismiss that is presently before the Court, and which Plaintiff has not opposed. For the reasons explained below, the motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED [*2]  IN PART.
According to the allegations in the complaint, which the Court treats as true for present purposes, Plaintiff was employed as a medical assistant for the Red Cross from September 1990 until October 2007. (Compl. ¶¶ 12, 21.) During her tenure, Plaintiff was never criticized for her performance, received merit-based raises, and received excellent job evaluations until her final evaluation. (Compl. ¶ 12.) In 1999, and again in 2000, Plaintiff went on disability leave because of pain in her neck and back resulting from having to stand in awkward positions for long periods of time to draw blood from donors, and from bending, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and lifting donors. (Compl. ¶¶ 14-16.) Many employees, including Plaintiff, complained about their working conditions and requested reasonable accommodations, but were ignored. (Compl. ¶¶ 15-16.)
In April 2007, Plaintiff participated in a labor strike in which she and others protested working conditions and pay-related issues. (Compl. ¶ 18.) During the protest, Defendants harassed and threatened Plaintiff and the other picketers. (Id.) In addition, defendant Garratty drove his car into a group of picketers with the intent of injuring [*3]  them, and ran over Plaintiff's foot. (Id.) Subsequently, in May 2007, defendant Turner prohibited Red Cross employees from disclosing information to others regarding working conditions or pay-related issues. (Compl. ¶ 19.) Defendants also hired security guards to protect management personnel and donors from Plaintiff and other union members. (Compl. ¶ 18.)
Several months later, in August 2007, Plaintiff complained to Defendants regarding pain and weakness in her knees that resulted from standing for excessive periods of time and from stooping and crouching. (Compl. ¶ 17.) Plaintiff requested a reasonable accommodation in the form of a stool on which she could sit during her shift to take weight off of her knees, but Defendants ignored her request. (Id.) Also in August 2007, Plaintiff was criticized in a performance evaluation for disclosing information to others regarding working conditions and pay-related issues. (Compl. ¶ 20.) In September 2007, Plaintiff was suspended as a result of the disclosures. (Id.) On October 1, 2007, Plaintiff filed a discrimination complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH"). (Compl. ¶ 21.) Defendants were served with [*4]  the DFEH complaint the following day, and they immediately terminated Plaintiff for making the disclosures and for challenging Defendants' refusal to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. (Id.)

II. DISCUSSION

A. Preemption Under the National Labor Relations Act
"Federal law may preempt state law in three ways: (1) federal law may explicitly preempt state law in a given area; (2) federal law may implicitly preempt state law by dominating regulation in a given area; or (3) state law may actually conflict with federal law." Young v. Coloma-Agaran, 340 F.3d 1053, 1055 (9th Cir. 2003). State and federal law actually conflict where one cannot comply with both state and federal requirements, or where state law "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress." Id. at 1055-56 (quoting Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U.S. 280, 287, 115 S. Ct. 1483, 131 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1995)). In a preemption analysis, "the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone." Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 724, 747, 105 S. Ct. 2380, 85 L. Ed. 2d 728 (1985) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Kentucky Ass'n of Health Plans, Inc. v. Miller, 538 U.S. 329, 341-42, 123 S. Ct. 1471, 155 L. Ed. 2d 468 (2003).
The National Labor Relations Act ("NLRA") does not contain an express preemption provision. Nevertheless, "[w]hen it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by § 7 of the [NLRA], or constitute an unfair [*5]  labor practice under § 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield." San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 244, 79 S. Ct. 773, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1959). In other words, "[w]hen an activity is arguably subject to § 7 or § 8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted." Id. at 245; see also Chamber of Commerce of United States v. Brown, 554 U.S. 60, 128 S. Ct. 2408, 2412, 171 L. Ed. 2d 264 (2008) ("Garmon pre-emption forbids States to 'regulate activity that the NLRA protects, prohibits, or arguably protects or prohibits.'" (quoting Wisconsin Dep't of Indus. v. Gould Inc., 475 U.S. 282, 286, 106 S. Ct. 1057, 89 L. Ed. 2d 223 (1986)). Where the NLRA preempts a state law claim pursuant to Garmon, the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB"), not the courts, has jurisdiction over that claim. Paige v. Henry J. Kaiser Co., 826 F.2d 857, 862 (9th Cir. 1987).
Section 7 of the NLRA confers upon employees
the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and . . . to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 158(a)(3) of [*6]  this title.
29 U.S.C. § 157. Section 8 prohibits employers from "interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing], or coerc[ing] employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section [7]," from discriminating "[with] regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization," and from "discharg[ing] or otherwise discriminat[ing] against an employee because he has filed charges or given testimony under this subchapter." Id. § 158(a)(1), (3)—(4). To determine whether an activity is subject to sections 7 or 8 of the NLRA, courts must "necessarily focus[] on the nature of the activities which the States have sought to regulate, rather than on the method of regulation adopted." Garmon, 359 U.S. at 243.
In the present action, Defendants contend that, pursuant to Garmon, the NLRA preempts Plaintiff's claims under sections 1102.5 and 232.5 of the California Labor Code and section 51.7 of the California Civil Code. Plaintiff alleges in the complaint that Defendants violated those statutes by criticizing her for discussing working conditions with others (Compl. ¶ 12), harassing and threatening her while she protested working conditions and pay issues (id. ¶ 18), ordering her to refrain from discussing working conditions and pay issues with others (id. ¶ 19), suspending [*7]  her for disclosing to others her working conditions and pay issues (id. ¶ 20), retaliating against her by terminating her after she filed a complaint with the DFEH (id. ¶¶ 21, 51, 57), and running over her foot with a car because she was taking a position during a labor dispute (id. ¶ 94).
The allegations contained in paragraphs 12, 18-20, and 94 of the complaint bring Plaintiff's claims under sections 1102.5, 232.5, and 51.7 squarely within the ambit of sections 7 and 8 of the NLRA. For example, in St. Margaret Mercy Healthcare Centers, 350 N.L.R.B. 203 (2007), the NLRB noted that "[i]t is axiomatic that discussing terms and conditions of employment with coworkers lies at the heart of protected Section 7 activity." Id. at 205. And in Valley Slurry Seal Co., 343 N.L.R.B. 233 (2004), the NLRB held that the defendant employer violated section 8(a)(1) "[b]y prohibiting its employees against discussing their terms and conditions of employment with fellow employees and threatening to retaliate for such acts." Id. at 252. Similarly, in Double Eagle Hotel & Casino, 341 N.L.R.B. 112 (2004), the NLRB found that "[a] rule, which on its face and on threat of discipline, expressly prohibits the discussion of wages and other terms and conditions of employment, plainly infringes upon Section 7 rights and violates Section 8(a)(1)." Id. at 115. On the other hand, to the extent that Plaintiff's claims are based on Defendants' alleged retaliation against Plaintiff for initiating [*8]  a DFEH complaint, the NLRA does not preempt those claims. Indeed, Defendants concede the point in the memorandum of points and authorities accompanying their motion to dismiss. (See Defs.' Mem. at 5 n.5.)
Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims under section 232.5 and 51.7 is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND on the ground that those claims are preempted by the NLRA pursuant to Garmon. To the extent—and only to the extent—that Plaintiff's section 1102.5 claim is premised on the allegation that Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff because she filed a DFEH complaint, the NLRA does not preempt that claim. However, by its plain terms, section 1102.5 confers liability only upon employers, not employees. See Cal. Labor Code § 1102.5. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's section 1102.5 claim is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to the Supervisory Defendants, but DENIED as to the Red Cross.

B. Violations of California's Fair Employment & Housing Act
California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12900 et seq., prohibits employers from discriminating against employees or prospective employees on the basis of various enumerated characteristics, including physical and mental disabilities and medical conditions. Id. § 12940(a). In addition, FEHA prohibits [*9]  employers from terminating the employment of, or otherwise discriminating against, "any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Id. § 12940(h). FEHA also requires employers to "take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Id. § 12940(k). Finally, employers must reasonably accommodate applicants or employees with "known physical or mental disabilit[ies]" so long as they can do so without undue hardship. Id. § 12940(m). If an applicant or employee with a known physical or mental disability or medical condition submits a request for reasonable accommodations, an employer must "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process" with that person. Id. § 12940(n).
Plaintiff alleges in the complaint that Defendants violated subsections (a), (h), (k), (m), and (n) of section 12940. However, section 12940 does not confer liability upon "nonemployer individuals" for discrimination, Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal. 4th 640, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333, 1347 (Cal. 1998), or for retaliation, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines P'ship, 42 Cal. 4th 1158, 72 Cal. Rptr. 3d 624, 177 P.3d 232, 243 (Cal. 2008). Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's section 12940 claims as to the Supervisory Defendants is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.

C. Negligence
Defendants contend that Plaintiff's negligence claim [*10]  is "preempted" by the Workers' Compensation Act ("WCA"), Cal. Labor Code §§ 3200 et seq. Section 3600 of the California Labor Code provides, in pertinent part:
Liability for the compensation provided by this division, in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person . . . , shall, without regard to negligence, exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the employment . . . in those cases where the following conditions of compensation concur:
(1) Where, at the time of the injury, both the employer and the employee are subject to the compensation provisions of this division.
(2) Where, at the time of the injury, the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment and is acting within the course of his or her employment.
(3) Where the injury is proximately caused by the employment, either with or without negligence.
. . . .
(9) Where the injury does not arise out of voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity not constituting part of the employee's work-related duties, except where these activities are a reasonable expectancy of, or are expressly or impliedly required by, the employment.
Cal. Labor Code § 3600(a). Subject to several statutory [*11]  exceptions not applicable here, "[w]here the conditions of compensation set forth in Section 3600 concur, the right to recover such compensation is . . . the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her dependents against the employer, and the fact that either the employee or the employer also occupied another or dual capacity prior to, or at the time of, the employee's industrial injury shall not permit the employee or his or her dependents to bring an action at law for damages against the employer." Id. § 3602(a). "These provisions establish that the liability of employers and insurers for industrial injury which results in occupational disability or death is limited to workers' compensation remedies." Charles J. Vacanti, M.D., Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 24 Cal. 4th 800, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 562, 14 P.3d 234, 245 (Cal. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Based on this statutory framework, California courts apply a two-part test to determine whether the WCA bars a particular claim. First, a court must "determine whether the [plaintiff's] alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions." Id. at 243; accord Operating Eng'rs Local 3 v. Johnson, 110 Cal. App. 4th 180, 1 Cal. Rptr. 3d 552, 555 (Ct. App. 2003). This requirement is met where the alleged injury arises out of and was sustained in the course of the employment, and causes a disability or gives rise to the need for medical treatment. Vacanti, 14 P.3d at 245 [*12] . "An injury is said to arise out of employment when it occurs by reason of a condition or incident of the employment. That is, the employment and the injury must be linked in some causal fashion. . . . The course of employment requirement ordinarily refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which the injury occurs. Thus an employee is in the course of his employment when he does those reasonable things which his [employment] contract . . . expressly or impliedly permits him to do." Ralphs Grocery Co. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 58 Cal. App. 4th 647, 68 Cal. Rptr. 2d 161, 163 (Ct. App. 1997) (citation, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted). Once the first requirement is met, the court must then decide "whether the alleged acts or motives that establish the elements of the cause of action fall outside the risks encompassed within the compensation bargain." Id. at 243-44.
Here, Plaintiff alleges in the complaint that she suffered injuries as a result of defendant Garratty running over her foot, and because Defendants failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the disability discrimination she suffered. (Compl. ¶¶ 106-107.) To the extent that Plaintiff seeks to recover negligence damages for the alleged injury to her foot and the alleged emotional pain and suffering resulting therefrom, the WCA does not preclude recovery because Plaintiff was engaged in a union activity for her personal benefit that cannot reasonably be treated as falling within the scope of Plaintiff's employment. State Comp. Ins. Fund v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 59 Cal. App. 3d 647, 130 Cal. Rptr. 831, 835 (Ct. App. 1976) ("[A]n injury to a union member while on the [employer's] premises for union activities [*13]  or purposes, and not as an incident to employment, is not deemed to arise out of employment." (citing Pac. Indem. Co. v. Indus. Accident Comm'n, 27 Cal. App. 2d 499, 81 P.2d 572, 574-75 (Ct. App. 1938))). To the extent that Plaintiff's negligence claim is based on Defendants' alleged failure to prevent the discrimination that Plaintiff allegedly suffered, it is not precluded by the WCA because employer misconduct that arises from "an animus that violates the fundamental policy of [the] state . . . cannot under any reasonable viewpoint be considered a normal part of the employment relationship or a risk reasonably encompassed within the compensation bargain." Gantt v. Sentry Ins., 1 Cal. 4th 1083, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 874, 824 P.2d 680, 691 (Cal. 1992) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), overruled on other grounds, Green v. Ralee Eng'g Co., 19 Cal. 4th 66, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (Cal. 1998). The Court therefore rejects Defendants' contention that the WCA bars Plaintiff's negligence claim.
The question remains whether Plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts in her complaint to state a claim of negligence. To prevail on such a claim, a plaintiff must prove (1) the existence of a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, (2) breach of that duty, (3) causation, and (4) injury to the plaintiff. Yu Fang Tan v. Arnel Mgmt. Co., 170 Cal. App. 4th 1087, 88 Cal. Rptr. 3d 754, 760-61 (Ct. App. 2009). Plaintiff has pleaded all of these elements only as to defendant Garratty. (See Compl. ¶¶ 18, 104-106.) Accordingly, Defendants' motion to [*14]  dismiss Plaintiff's negligence claim is DENIED as to Garratty, but GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND as to the remaining Defendants.

D. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
California law prohibits employers from terminating employees at will when such termination is prohibited by statute or violates public policy. Tameny v. Atl. Richfield Co., 27 Cal. 3d 167, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330, 1336-37 (Cal. 1980). Like FEHA claims arising under section 12940 of the California Government Code, claims of wrongful termination cannot lie against individual supervisors. Baird, 957 P.2d at 1348.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants wrongfully terminated her in violation of sections 12940 of the California Government Code and sections 232.5, 1102.5, and 1103 of the California Labor Code. (Compl. ¶¶ 109-110.) Based on the unambiguous language in Baird, Plaintiff is precluded from asserting this claim against the Supervisory Defendants. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to the Supervisory Defendants.

III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court rules as follows: Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims under section 232.5 of the California Labor Code and section 51.7 of the California Civil Code is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to all Defendants. The motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claim under section 1102.5 of the California Labor Code is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to the Supervisory Defendants, and DENIED as to the Red Cross to the extent that [*15]  the claim is based on retaliation against Plaintiff for filing a DFEH complaint. The motion to dismiss Plaintiff's wrongful termination and FEHA claims is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to the Supervisory Defendants. The motion to dismiss Plaintiff's negligence claim is DENIED as to defendant Garratty, but GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND as to the remaining Defendants.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
