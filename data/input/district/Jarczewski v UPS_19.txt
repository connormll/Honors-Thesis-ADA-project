CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings: Order (1) GRANTLNG-IN-PART and DENYING-IN-PART Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 30); and (2) VACATING the August 16, 2021 hearing (IN CHAMBERS)
Before the Court is the motion for summary judgment of Defendant United Parcel Service, Inc. ("Defendant" or "UPS"). ("Motion," Dkt. No. 30-1.) The Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution without a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. Upon consideration of the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the Court GRANTS-IN-PART and DENIES-IN-PART Defendant's Motion and VACATES the August 16, 2021 hearing.

I. BACKGROUND
This case [*2]  arises out of disability discrimination that Plaintiff Nicole Jarczewski allegedly suffered while employed by Defendant.
On January 18, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in the San Bernardino County Superior Court, alleging the following six causes of action against Defendant:1 (1) disability discrimination - Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") (Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(a)); (2) failure to accommodate disability - FEHA (Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(m)); (3) failure to engage in the interactive process - FEHA (Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(n)); (4) retaliation - FEHA (Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(m)(2)); (5) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation - FEHA (Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(k)); and (6) failure to provide personnel file (Cal. Lab. Code § 1198.5). ("Complaint," Dkt. No. 1-1.)
On April 19, 2021, Defendant filed the Motion and the following documents in support:
• Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("SUF," Dkt. No. 30-2);
• Declaration of D. Chad Anderton ("Anderton") and Exhibits A-D (Dkt. No. 30-3);
• Declaration of Human Resources Service Center Occupational Health Supervisor Brenda Hellerud ("Hellerud") and Exhibits A-F (Dkt. No. 30-4);
• Declaration of Employee Services Supervisor Al Hijar ("Hijar") and Exhibits A-H ("Hijar Decl.," Dkt. No. 30-5); and
• Declaration of Martin Valdiviez (Dkt. No. 30-6).
(See Motion.) Plaintiff opposed the Motion [*3]  on June 28, 20202 ("Opposition," Dkt. No. 40) and filed the following documents in support:
• Opposition to Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("SUF Opposition," Dkt. No. 40-1);
• Declaration of Nicole Jarczewski and Exhibits A-O (Dkt. Nos. 40-2 through 40-17); and
• Declaration of Rudy Balderama and Exhibits P-AA (Dkt. Nos. 40-18 through 40-29, 41).
Defendant replied in support of its Motion on July 6, 2021 ("Reply," Dkt. No. 42) and filed the following documents in support:
• Reply Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("SUF Reply," Dkt. No. 42-1);
• Declaration of Anderton and Exhibit A (Dkt. No. 42-2); and
• Declaration of Hijar and Exhibits A and B (Dkt. No. 42-3).

II. FACTS
Except as noted, the following material facts are sufficiently supported by admissible evidence and are uncontroverted. They are "admitted to exist without controversy" for purposes of the Motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); L.R. 56-3.

A. Background
Defendant is one of the world's largest package delivery companies. (SUF ¶ 1.) Defendant currently employs Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 42.) Defendant hired Plaintiff as a Loader on June 28, 2004. (Id. ¶ 42.) Plaintiff worked as a Clerk from 2005 to 2015. (Id. ¶ 43.) Defendant promoted Plaintiff to Package [*4]  Driver in 2015. (Id. ¶ 44.) Plaintiff was a Package Driver until she took a leave of absence on January 27, 2017. (Id. ¶ 44.) Plaintiff suffers from a disability called rheumatoid arthritis. (Id. ¶ 45.)

B. Need for Accommodations Prior to January 2017
On September 21, 2106, Plaintiff sought an accommodation to limit her schedule to 9.5 hours a day, five days a week. (Id. ¶ 48.) On that same day, Defendant sent Plaintiff a letter enclosing a Request for Medical Information, which asked her to direct her medical provider to complete the required information on the form. (Id. ¶ 49.) Plaintiff's medical provider submitted the completed form on October 11, 2016, confirming the request for a schedule of no more than 9.5 hours per day, five days per week. (Id. ¶¶ 51-52.)
On November 11, 2016, Plaintiff suffered an injury to her back. (Id. ¶ 54.) The injury did not stem from any specific incident, but rather accumulated over the course of the day. (Id. ¶ 55.) Defendant granted Plaintiff medical leave for the next week. (Id. ¶ 56.) On Monday, November 21, 2016, Plaintiff returned to work and indicated that she was still in significant pain. (Id. ¶ 56.) Plaintiff informed her supervisor that she [*5]  was in a lot of pain, went to a clinic for medical attention, and filed a workers' compensation claim. (Id. ¶ 57.) After evaluation, Plaintiff's medical provider placed her on light duty, with restrictions that included "no heavy lifting, having an assistant in her truck to help her with lifting and other tasks on her route, and working shorter hours, approximately eight hours per day." (Id. ¶ 58.) Defendant accommodated those restrictions. (Id. ¶ 59.)
On November 28, 2016, Area Human Resources Manager Martin Valdiviez ("Valdiviez") and Hellerud met with Plaintiff to understand her need for accommodation. (Id. ¶ 60.) The parties identified three positions that might accommodate Plaintiff's request for a 9.5 hour schedule: shifter, clerk, and air driver. (Id. ¶ 61.) None of the three were available at the time. (Id. ¶ 61.)
On December 2, 2016, Plaintiff injured her shoulder while on duty when she was required to slam on her brakes to avoid a car accident. (Id. ¶ 62.) As an accommodation for her previous back injury, an assistant accompanied Plaintiff when she injured her shoulder. (Id. ¶ 63.) After Plaintiff's shoulder injury, her workers' compensation medical provider placed further [*6]  restrictions on her, stating that she could not operate a company vehicle. (Id. ¶ 64.)
Defendant accommodated those further restrictions in the form of a 30-day Temporary Alternative Work ("TAW") assignment. (Id. ¶ 65.) During the TAW assignment, Plaintiff performed office tasks at Defendant's dispatch office. (Id. ¶ 66.) All parties understood that this was a temporary assignment. (Id. ¶ 67.)
On January 11, 2017, Valdiviez and Hellerud again met with Plaintiff to discuss her accommodations. (Id. ¶ 68.) As a result of that meeting, on January 12, 2017, Defendant determined that no reasonable accommodation existed to keep Plaintiff in the Driver position. (Id. ¶ 69.) Neither Valdiviez nor West Region Workforce Planning Manager Tom Troup are aware of any examples where drivers were accommodated with a limit on the number of hours required to work per day. (Id. ¶ 71.)
Defendant advised Plaintiff that it would accommodate her by placing her on a six-month search plan in which it would attempt to identify alternative available positions that would accommodate Plaintiff's work restrictions. (Id. ¶ 74.) This determination placed Plaintiff on a leave of absence as an accommodation, effective [*7]  January 27, 2017. (Id. ¶ 75.)

C. Leave of Absence After January 2017
On March 9, 2017, Defendant sent Plaintiff a letter acknowledging receipt of her medical provider's March 2, 2017 report and encouraging her to contact Defendant to request further accommodations. (Id. ¶ 77.)
On January 9, 2018, while on medical leave, Plaintiff submitted a second request for accommodations. (Id. ¶ 79.) Defendant responded on the same day, providing Plaintiff with a Request for Medical Information for her medical provider to complete with information regarding her current restrictions. (Id. ¶ 80.) On February 13, 2018, Defendant informed Plaintiff by mail that it had not yet received the requested medical information. (Id. ¶ 81.) Plaintiff transmitted the documents to Defendant no earlier than May 2018. (Id. ¶ 83.) Dr. Aaron Coppelson's ("Dr. Coppelson's") medical documentation, dated February 19, 2018, which Defendant received in June 2018, indicated that at the time Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of the Package Driver position. (Id. ¶ 84.) Plaintiff agrees that she was unable to perform the essential functions of her job as of February 2018. (Id. ¶ 85.) On May 6, 2018, Plaintiff's [*8]  medical provider, Dr. Wade Faerber, indicated that due to her shoulder injury, Plaintiff was precluded from performing heavy lifting or overhead work activities and therefore unable to return to regular job duties. (Id. ¶ 86.)
Defendant requested medical documentation from Plaintiff again on June 14 and June 21, 2018. (Id. ¶ 87.) Plaintiff provided her complete information on June 22, 2018. (Id. ¶ 88.) In that documentation, her medical provider indicated that she still could not perform the essential functions of the Package Driver position. (Id. ¶ 89.)
In an August 30, 2018 meeting with Hellerud and Hijar, Plaintiff agreed that there were no accommodations that would permit her to perform the essential functions of the Package Driver position. (Id. ¶ 91.) During that meeting, Plaintiff stated that she believed she could perform the essential functions of a Clerk or Overgoods position with accommodations. (Id. ¶ 92.) However, she also stated that her "guesstimate" was that she "could probably safely [lift] about 30 pounds." ("Jarczewski Deposition," Dkt. No. 30-3 Ex. D at 209:19-21.) Defendant ultimately placed Plaintiff on an additional six-month job search leave and asked her to obtain [*9]  additional information from her doctor. (Id. ¶ 95.)
Plaintiff provided Defendant with at least one additional updated medical report during that six-month leave. (Id. ¶ 96.) On October 2, 2018, Dr. David L. Wood ("Dr. Wood"), an orthopedic surgeon, examined Plaintiff in connection with her workers' compensation claim and determined that she had regular pain and difficulty performing regular daily tasks, standing, and walking. (Id. ¶¶ 97-99.) Dr. Wood recommended that Plaintiff be precluded from heavy lifting, repetitive work at or above shoulder level, and repetitive bending and stooping. (Id. ¶ 100.) Dr. Wood's November 16, 2018 follow-up report again opined that Plaintiff should be precluded from lifting more than ten pounds, repeated bending and stooping, and repetitive activities at or above shoulder level, such that she could not return to her position as package delivery driver. (Id. ¶¶ 101-102.)
On December 6, 2018, Dr. Coppelson examined Plaintiff and determined that she had pain when performing activities, had not improved significantly, and ought to maintain the same work status as per previous exams. (Id. ¶¶ 104-105.)

D. Current Status
Defendant has not terminated Plaintiff's [*10]  employment; she has been on a continuous leave of absence since January 26, 2017. (Id. ¶ 109.) She has received approximately $70,000 in workers' compensation disability benefits. (Id. ¶ 110.) Plaintiff cannot return to the Package Driver position; she suffers from back and shoulder pain and is limited in her ability to stand, lift, lower, bend, and squat. (Id. ¶¶ 112-115.)
On January 25, 2018, Plaintiff filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH"), which issued a right to sue letter on the same day. (SUF ¶ 116.)

E. Potential Placement in Other Positions
Plaintiff contends that she could have performed the jobs of "Clerk" or "Customer Counter." (SUF Opposition ¶ 132.) Plaintiff stated in her deposition that during previous work as a clerk, "I was required to be able to lift 70 pounds on my own . . . it's not so much that I have to be able to, you know, bench press 70. It's just that I have to be able to move it, whether it be, you know, rolling it or pushing it or sliding it." (Jarczewski Deposition at 37:17-22, 39:15-19.) Defendant contends that the Clerk position requires a person to be able to lift up to 70 pounds in weight. (SUF ¶ 25.) The [*11]  Customer Counter position has the same requirements for ability to move items. (SUF Opposition ¶ 33.) Plaintiff elsewhere contends that she could have performed the job of "Overgoods," which has the same lifting requirements as a clerk. (Jarczewski Deposition at 210:21-211:11.)
The testimony on this point is somewhat contradictory. At one point, Plaintiff states that a clerk must be able to lift 70 pounds on her own. At another point, she explains that this isn't exactly the case. Defendant's own internal job descriptions state that a clerk must be able to lift 51-70 pounds, engage in repetitive bending and squatting, work up to 9.5 hours per day, and assist in moving packages weighing up to 150 pounds. (Hijar Decl. Ex. F.) The Operations Clerk and Customer Counter Clerk have similar requirements. (Hijar Decl. Exs. G, H.) Plaintiff does not dispute the authenticity of these documents. (SUF Opposition ¶ 28.)
The Court finds there to be a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Plaintiff could have fulfilled the requirements of these positions. True, Defendant contends that they require lifting seventy pounds. But the Ninth Circuit has found that whether this particular Defendant [*12]  overinflated the lifting requirements of its jobs to be a factual dispute. Wright v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 609 F. App'x 918, 919 (9th Cir. 2015) (finding "genuine dispute of material fact as to whether lifting packages weighing more than 40 pounds unassisted was an essential function of the utility driver position"). And Plaintiff, who has actually held the job, persuasively explains that the ability to deadlift 70 pounds is not essential to the job. This is the sort of testimony material to determining a job's requirements. Cal Govt. Code § 12926(f)(2)(G). The Court finds that whether Plaintiff could perform the Clerk job is a disputed issue of material fact.

III. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden of identifying the portions of the pleadings and record that it believes demonstrate the absence of an issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Where the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need not produce evidence negating or disproving every essential element of the non-moving party's case. Id. at 325. Instead, the moving party need only prove there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving [*13]  party's case. Id.; In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010). The moving party must show that "under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
If the moving party has sustained its burden, the non-moving party must then show that there is a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. The non-moving party must make an affirmative showing on all matters placed at issue by the motion as to which it has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. A genuine issue of material fact exists "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. "This burden is not a light one. The non-moving party must show more than the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." In re Oracle, 627 F.3d at 387 (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252).
When deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir. 1991). Thus, summary judgment for the moving party is proper when a "rational trier of fact" would not be able to find for the non-moving party based on the record taken as a whole. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Whether Plaintiff's Allegations Are Time-Barred
Defendant contends that some of Plaintiff's allegations are time-barred. (Motion at 13.) Plaintiff [*14]  does not oppose this contention. (See generally Opposition.) Failure to oppose summary judgment is not an independent ground upon which to grant the motion. The Ninth Circuit has made clear that "a nonmoving party's failure to [file an opposition] does not excuse the moving party's affirmative duty under Rule 56 to demonstrate its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law." Martinez v. Stanford, 323 F.3d 1178, 1182 (9th Cir.2003) (discussing granting summary judgment for failure to file an opposition in violation of a Local Rule). Regardless of whether the non-moving party files an opposition to a motion for summary judgment, the district court may not enter judgment in favor of the moving party unless the movant meets its burden to show there are no genuine issues of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 1183; see also L.R. 7-12 (failure to file an opposition may be deemed consent to the granting or denial of a motion, except as to summary judgment). The Court, though hampered by Plaintiff's failure to brief this issue, therefore considers Defendant's contention on the merits.
As of January 1, 2020, a plaintiff alleging a FEHA violation must submit a claim to DFEH within three years of the date upon which the alleged violation occurred. [*15]  Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(e). However, prior to January 1, 2020, the statute of limitations on FEHA claims was one year. Pollock v. Tri-Modal Distribution Servs., Inc. , 11 Cal. 5th 918, 491 P.3d 290,281 Cal. Rptr. 3d 498 , 2021 WL 3137429, at *2 (Cal.  2021) (summarizing statutory change). The California Supreme Court made it clear in Pollock that this change in the statute of limitation is not retroactive. Id. Plaintiff filed her administrative complaint on January 25, 2018. Thus, Plaintiff's claims for all activity occurring prior to January 25, 2017 are time-barred. The portions of this case that are not time-barred are Defendant's placing of Plaintiff on leave of absence on January 27, 2017 and in August 2018, while it searched for alternative positions for her.

B. Claims

1. First Cause of Action
Plaintiff's first claim contends that Defendant violated FEHA when it forced her to take a leave of absence rather than placing her in an alternate position. (Complaint ¶¶ 26-35.) Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(a) (FEHA) makes it unlawful "[f]or an employer, because of . . . physical disability, mental disability, [or] medical condition . . . to bar or to discharge the person from employment . . ."
FEHA discrimination claims are analyzed under the burden-shifting framework set forth by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (applying the McDonnell Douglas test to FEHA claims). First, the plaintiff must establish a prima [*16]  facie case of discrimination. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 354. If the plaintiff does so, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut that presumption of discrimination by producing evidence that raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether the employer's action was taken for a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. Id. at 355-356. If the employer is able to do so, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the employer's stated justifications are pretextual. Id. at 356.
Defendant moves for summary judgment, contending that Plaintiff was not performing her position competently and cannot demonstrate that she suffered adverse employment action. (Motion at 14-16.) Further, Defendant argues that even if Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case, she cannot demonstrate that the Defendant's stated reasons for placing her on leave are pretextual. (Motion at 19-20.) Plaintiff asserts that she can establish a prima facie case but does not address whether she can establish pretext. (Opposition at 4-11.)
"Under McDonnell Douglas, [a plaintiff] must prove a prima facie case of discrimination by showing (1) she is a member of a protected class, (2) she was performing the position she held competently, (3) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) circumstances [*17]  give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination." Means v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, Dep't of Pub. Health, 749 F. Supp. 2d 998, 1004 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (internal citations omitted).
It is undisputed that Plaintiff is a member of a protected class. Defendant contends that she did not competently perform her job because she could not perform its essential functions. (Motion at 15.) However, as discussed above, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of another job that she had done.
Defendant contends that Plaintiff was not the victim of adverse action because she was placed on paid leave. (Motion at 14.) But the undisputed facts do not establish that all of Plaintiff's leave was paid. Defendant acknowledges as much but argues that her unpaid leave did not constitute adverse action because she could not have performed paid work with reasonable accommodations. (Id. at 15.) But, as described above, this is not a settled fact.
Finally, if a reasonable trier of fact were to find that Plaintiff could have performed the clerk position, it might also find that Defendant's placing her unpaid leave instead led to an inference of unlawful discrimination. Plaintiff thus establishes a prima facie case.
Defendant's rejoinder is that [*18]  it legitimately followed the direction of her medical providers in restricting her work and placing her on leave. The undisputed facts at least raise a genuine issue of fact that this is a legitimate reason for Defendant's actions. The burden thus shifts back to Plaintiff to show that this argument is pretextual.
Federal and California courts have taken varying positions as to what an employee must show at the summary judgment stage to demonstrate than an employer's justifications are pretextual. "What has been described as the predominant view, however . . . requires the employee [to] rebut the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason with substantial evidence of its falsity or present other evidence suggesting a discriminatory basis, or some combination of the two such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer engaged in intentional discrimination." Hersant v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 57 Cal. App. 4th 997, 1004 (1997).
Plaintiff did not oppose Defendant's contention that she cannot establish that Defendant's rationale was pretextual. As discussed above, however, while this hampers the Court's analysis, it does not compel the Court to find for Defendant. And, indeed, the Court finds that it cannot. For the same reason that a reasonable [*19]  trier of fact might find it could infer discrimination, a reasonable trier of fact might find that Defendant's claim that it had to place Plaintiff on leave was pretextual: namely that the claim that there were no jobs for her was false. The Court thus DENIES summary judgment for Defendant as to Plaintiff's first cause of action.

2. Second Cause of Action
Plaintiff's second claim contends that Defendant violated FEHA when it failed to accommodate her disability. (Complaint ¶¶ 36-48.) Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(m) (FEHA) makes it unlawful "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee." Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability when it did not offer reassignment to a vacant position. (Opposition at 19.) Defendant ties its arguments against the second claim to its arguments against the first claim. (Motion at 20-21.) Thus, the Court DENIES summary judgment for Defendant as to Plaintiff's second cause of action.

3. Third Cause of Action
Plaintiff's third claim contends that Defendant violated FEHA when it failed to engage in the interactive process. (Complaint ¶¶ 44-51.) [*20]  Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(n) (FEHA) makes it unlawful "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition."
"FEHA requires employers to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation. In considering these types of claims, courts must determine what caused the breakdown in the interactive process and ascertain who is to blame for the collapse. Employers will only be liable if they bear responsibility for the breakdown." Huck v. Kone Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144438, 2011 WL 6294466, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2011), aff'd, 539 F. App'x 754 (9th Cir. 2013) (internal quotations and citations omitted).
Plaintiff's Complaint does not specify the ways in which Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process. However, in her Opposition, Plaintiff claims that Defendant failed to engage by using a regimented procedure; declining to suggest that an employee may need an accommodation; issuing boilerplate [*21]  letters apprising Plaintiff of the process; searching for positions for her for only six months; requiring Plaintiff to participate in meetings alone, without counsel or doctors; and working with "corporate legal." (Opposition at 12-19.)
Many of these attributes of Defendant's ADA process are quite standard among corporate dispute resolution policies. Moreover, some are meant to be features, not bugs: the requirement that Defendant not affirmatively suggest accommodations to non-disabled employees is likely an attempt to avoid harassment. True, not all of these procedures would pass muster in an Article III court. But employers are only liable under § 12940(n) if they bear responsibility for a "breakdown." And Plaintiff demonstrates no such breakdown here. Rather, the uncontested facts as a whole demonstrate that Defendant has spent four years attempting to work with Plaintiff. The process ended because Plaintiff's doctors determined that Plaintiff could not fulfill Defendant's job descriptions. As determined above, the Court finds there to be a genuine issue of material fact as to whether these job descriptions were accurate or pretextual; however, this is different from a procedural breakdown. [*22] 
The Court therefore GRANTS summary judgment for Defendant as to Plaintiff's third cause of action.

4. Fourth Cause of Action
Plaintiff's fourth claim contends that Defendant violated FEHA when it retaliated against her. (Complaint ¶¶ 52-59.) Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(m)(2) (FEHA) makes it unlawful "[f]or an employer . . . [to] retaliate or otherwise discriminate against a person for requesting accommodation under this subdivision, regardless of whether the request was granted."
"The elements of . . . FEHA [retaliation] claims require that (1) the plaintiff establish a prima facie case of retaliation, (2) the defendant articulate a legitimate nonretaliatory explanation for its acts, and (3) the plaintiff show that the defendant's proffered explanation is merely a pretext for the illegal termination." Flait v. N. Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal. App. 4th 467, 476, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992), reh'g denied and opinion modified (Mar. 5, 1992) (citations omitted). "To establish a prima facie case, the plaintiff must show that he engaged in a protected activity, his employer subjected him to adverse employment action, and there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." Id. (citations omitted).
Plaintiff contends that Defendant retaliated against her by placing her on a leave of [*23]  absence after she requested accommodations. (Complaint ¶ 54.) Defendant moves for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a prima facie case because she was not subject to adverse employment action. (Motion at 22-23.) Rather, she was placed on leave because it was not possible to accommodate her sufficiently to allow her to perform any job. (Id. at 23.) Defendant additionally argues that even if Plaintiff could demonstrate a prima facie case, it has a legitimate reason for placing her on leave. (Id.) Plaintiff puts forth no evidence of any retaliatory motive. (Id.) Plaintiff does not oppose Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to this cause of action. (See generally Opposition.)
The Court agrees with Defendant. There is simply no evidence in the record that Defendant acted with any sort of retaliatory intent. Rather, it is clear that Defendant attempted to accommodate a person with severe and increasing work-related limitations. As discussed above, it may be that Defendant was ultimately wrong about its work requirements. But error does not retaliation make. The Court therefore GRANTS summary judgment for Defendant as to Plaintiff's fourth cause of action.

 [*24] 5. Fifth Cause of Action
Plaintiff's fifth claim contends that Defendant violated FEHA when it failed to prevent discrimination or retaliation against her. (Complaint ¶¶ 60-67.) Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(k) (FEHA) makes it unlawful "[f]or an employer, labor organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training program, or any training program leading to employment, to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." "Courts have required a finding of actual discrimination or harassment under FEHA before a plaintiff may prevail under section 12940, subdivision (k)." Carter v. California Dep't of Veterans Affs., 38 Cal. 4th 914, 925 n.4, 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 223, 135 P.3d 637 (2006). Both parties agree that this claim rises or falls with the others. (Motion at 23; Opposition at 24.) Defendant additionally contends that this claim must fail as a matter of law because it maintains anti-discrimination policies. (Motion at 23.) That argument, however, does not follow. A party may maintain anti-discrimination policies that do not take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination. Here, it appears Defendant's process for creating its job descriptions make have been flawed. The Court therefore DENIES summary judgment for Defendant as to Plaintiff's fifth cause of action.

6. Sixth Cause of Action
Plaintiff's sixth [*25]  claim contends that Defendant unlawfully failed to provide Plaintiff's personnel file. (Complaint ¶¶ 68-72.) Cal. Lab. Code § 1198.5 provides that employers shall make the contents of personnel records available to any current or former employee within thirty days of receipt of a written request. Cal. Lab. Code § 1198.5(b)(1). However, "[i]f an employee or former employee files a lawsuit that relates to a personnel matter against his or her employer or former employer, the right of the employee, former employee, or his or her representative to inspect or copy personnel records under this section ceases during the pendency of the lawsuit in the court with original jurisdiction." Id. at (n).
Defendant does not dispute that it has not provided Plaintiff with a copy of her records. However, it contends that summary judgment is warranted in its favor because Plaintiff submitted her request after she submitted a workers' compensation claim. (Motion at 24.) Plaintiff does not oppose. (See generally Opposition.)
The Court is not convinced that Defendant's is the only plausible reading of § 1198.5(n). It may be that "files a lawsuit" refers to the moment when the actual lawsuit is filed in state or federal court, not a worker's compensation claim. However, [*26]  as Plaintiff did not oppose, and the Court could find no law on the question, it GRANTS summary judgment for Defendant as to Plaintiff's sixth cause of action.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons above, the Court GRANTS-IN-PART and DENIES-IN-PART Defendant's Motion. The August 16, 2021 hearing is VACATED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
