Opinion



ORDER
THIS CAUSE comes before the Court upon the Plaintiff EEOC's Motion for Clarification of Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment (Dkt. #124). The Court grants the Motion and clarifies the Order as follows:
As to the first question, the Court answers in the negative. The Court does not hold that the Hospital had an obligation to reassign Leokadia Bryk ("Bryk") to the vacant positions for which she qualified without competition as a matter of law. More than one disabled employee could seek the same position as an accommodation, in which case an employer would have to make the two employees compete for the position. Therefore, whether Bryk had to compete with others [*2]  for the vacant positions is one factor, out of many, that the jury may consider regarding the reasonableness of the accommodation.
As to the second question, the Court answers in the affirmative. The Court does hold that the Hospital's thirty-day period for Bryk to identify a vacant position for which she qualified is reasonable as a matter of law. Once the Hospital determined that Bryk could not use the cane in the BHU, which the Court ruled was not a reasonable accommodation, thirty days is certainly reasonable as compared to same day termination.
Although a reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B), even if a disabled employee is qualified for and capable of performing another existing position, the employer is not required to reassign the employee if there is no vacancy. Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir. 2001). Therefore, under these facts this issue turns on whether a position that became available thirty days after termination was "vacant" under the ADA.
Although the Eleventh Circuit has not specifically defined the term "vacant" in the context of the ADA, other circuits define "vacant" to mean that the position is available at or around the time the employee asks for a reasonable accommodation [*3]  or the employer knows that it will become available in the fairly immediate future. See Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1175 (10th Cir. 1999) (en banc) ("'[A] vacant position' includes not only positions that are at the moment vacant, but also, includes positions that the employer reasonably anticipates will become vacate in the fairly immediate future"); McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 97-98 (2d Cir. 2009) (Plaintiff "must demonstrate the existence, at or around the time when accommodation was sought, of an existing vacant position to which she could have been reassigned."); Taylor v. Pepsi-Cola Co., 196 F.3d 1106, 1111 (10th Cir. 1999) ("To survive summary judgment, Plaintiff must establish that he was qualified to perform an appropriate vacant job which he must specifically identify and show was available within the company at or about the time he requested reassignment."). The Court adopts this definition.
Therefore, Bryk's options for reassignment include positions that were vacant at or near the time of her request for accommodation, which the Court determined was on October 18, 2011, when she submitted the Work Clearance Form. The Court concludes that the Health Educator position posted on December 6, 2011, was not "vacant" at or near the time of her request for an accommodation. See Boykin v. ATC/VanCom of Colorado. L.P., 247 F.3d 1061 (10th Cir. 2001) (citing Monette v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 90 F.3d 1173, 1176 (6th Cir. 1996) abrogated by Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp., Inc., 681 F.3d 312 (6th Cir. 2012) (employer acted within parameters [*4]  of ADA in keeping employee on unpaid leave for thirty-seven days before terminating him when no new position opened). See also Bristol v. Bd. of County Com'rs of County of Clear Creek, 281 F.3d 1148, 1167 (10th Cir. 2002) vacated in part on other grounds 312 F.3d 1213 (10th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (as a matter of law position becoming available three months after termination is not a "vacancy" under the ADA's duty to reassign.)
It is therefore ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that:
1. Plaintiff EEOC's Motion for Clarification of Order on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment (Dkt. #124) is GRANTED as stated herein.
DONE and ORDERED in Tampa, Florida, this 27th day of February, 2015.
