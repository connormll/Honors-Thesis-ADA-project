Opinion



MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S FINAL REPORT, RECOMMENDATION, AND ORDER
Defendant Don Park USA Limited Partnership ("Don Park") has moved to dismiss the original complaint of plaintiff Michael Perry ("Perry"). [Doc. 7].1 In response, Perry filed a first amended complaint, [Doc. 11], as well as an opposition to Don Park's motion to dismiss, [Doc. 12]. Don Park has filed a consolidated reply to Perry's first amended complaint and in support of its motion to dismiss. [Doc. 13]. For the reasons that follow, the Clerk is DIRECTED to STRIKE Perry's first amended complaint, [Doc. 11], from the docket because it was not filed within the time period for filing an amended pleading as a matter of course nor did Perry obtain the consent of Don Park or leave of Court to file it, and it is RECOMMENDED that Don Park's motion to dismiss the original complaint, [Doc. 7], be GRANTED and that this case be DISMISSED [*2] .

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
According to his original complaint, Perry, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ("MS") in February 2019, began working for Don Park as a sheet metal worker in March 2019. [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 12-13].2 Perry informed his supervisor, Scott Houston ("Houston"), "of his illness," and on June 26, 2019, Perry's treating physician at the Shepherd Center provided him "with a request for an accommodation for Don Park to allow him time to manage his illness and corresponding treatments," which included treatments "on a monthly basis." [Id. ¶¶ 13-17]. Perry's physician also "requested that when symptoms related to [Perry's] illness increased," he be allowed "to be absent from work on those days." [Id. ¶ 17].
Perry alleges that he was "made to work in the back of the warehouse where there [were] no fans or cooling systems" and that in the summer, the heat was extreme and "exacerbated his MS symptoms," so he "requested, on several occasions, to return to his normal workstation where there was a fan," but that Houston denied his requests. [Id. ¶¶ 18-19]. He also alleges that after he was "pushed to the ground and threatened with physical harm," he "complained to Houston [*3]  about the harassment due to his illness" on October 11, 2019, but Houston said, "'you keep complaining about people harassing you, but you're the least common denominator in all of the situations, so maybe you're the real problem here.'" [Id. ¶¶ 20-21]. He further alleges that Houston then directed Jan Chappell ("Chappell"), a Union Steward, to instruct Perry's co-workers "not to speak to him" and that Chappell told him that he needed to "'toughen up'" and that he had to have "'thick skin if [he] want[ed] to work in this industry.'" [Id. ¶¶ 22-23].
Subsequently, Perry alleges that on October 16, 2019, he "complained to [] Chappell about the physical assault and threats by a coworker, and was told by Chappell not to tell the supervisor," but Perry informed Houston that he had been assaulted, at which time Houston "threw his hands up and said, 'I don't know anything about it' and walked away." [Id. ¶ 24]. He then asserts that he was terminated from his employment with Don Park on October 18, 2019, purportedly due to a lack of work even though Don Park had "recently hired [five] people for sheet metal and shipping departments prior to [his] termination" and he "had never been issued any [*4]  warnings for performance." [Id. ¶¶ 25-28].
On April 15, 2020, Perry filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), [id. ¶ 9]; see also [Doc. 7-2 at 2],3 and on July 23, 2020, he filed his original complaint against Don Park, asserting claims for disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 31-79]. In particular, Perry alleges in Count I that Don Park "terminated [his] employment because of his disability, perceived disability, or record of having a disability" in that he had "physical impairments, which limited one or more major life activities, including but not limited to seeing, hearing, speaking, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working," and that he was terminated "shortly after [he] complained of harassment due to his disability." [Id. ¶¶ 32, 38-40]; see also [id. ¶¶ 29, 35-37]. He asserts that Don Park "treated other employees outside [his] protected class differently." [Id. ¶ 42].
In Count II, Perry asserts a failure to accommodate claim, [id. ¶¶ 51-66], in [*5]  which he alleges that he requested that Don Park accommodate his disability by "allowing him to take medical leave when necessary to treat his disability and [] to return to his normal workstation where there was a fan because the heat exacerbated his MS symptoms," but that upon receipt of his requests, Don Park "failed to engage in any interactive process with [him]" and "refused to provide [him] with reasonable accommodations, even though to do so would not impose an undue hardship," [id. ¶¶ 57-59]. And, in Count III, he asserts an ADA retaliation claim, [id. ¶¶ 67-79], alleging that he "has mental health impairments which substantially limit one or more major life activities including but not limited to concentrating, thinking and working"; that Don Park "was aware of [his] disabilities"; that Don Park "terminated [him] for requesting an accommodation for his disability and/or perceived disability"; and that Don Park "retaliated against [him] by terminating his employment on the basis of his request for an accommodation," [id. ¶¶ 68, 70, 72, 74].
Don Park has moved to dismiss Perry's original complaint for failure to state a claim, [Doc. 7], and Perry filed a first amended complaint, [*6]  [Doc. 11], and a response to Don Park's motion to dismiss, [Doc. 12]. Don Park has filed a consolidated reply to Perry's first amended complaint and in support of its motion to dismiss, [Doc. 13], and the pending motion to dismiss, [Doc. 7], is now ripe for ruling.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) authorizes dismissal of an action if the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In considering a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept Perry's allegations as true and construe the complaint in his favor. Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S. Ct. 2229, 81 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1984); Duke v. Cleland, 5 F.3d 1399, 1402 (11th Cir. 1993); Tapsoba v. Khiani Alpharetta, LLC, Civil Action No. 1:13-CV-1519-RWS, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129286, 2013 WL 4855255, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 11, 2013).4 "While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, [Perry's] obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle[ment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (last alteration in original) (citations and internal marks omitted); see also Lenbro Holding Inc. v. Falic, 503 F. App'x 906, 909 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (alterations in original) (citation omitted) ("Allegations entitled to no assumption of truth include '[l]egal conclusions without adequate factual support' or '[f]ormulaic recitations of the elements of a claim.'").
"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief [*7]  above the speculative level," Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (footnote and citation omitted), as "a complaint must plead 'enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,'" Cisneros v. Petland, Inc., 972 F.3d 1204, 1210 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The Supreme Court in Iqbal held:
Two working principles underlie our decision in Twombly. First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. Rule 8 marks a notable and generous departure from the hyper-technical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions. Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss. . . . [W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not "show[n]"-"that the pleader [*8]  is entitled to relief."
Id. at 678-79 (last alteration in original) (citations omitted); see also Gibson-Carter v. Rape Crisis Ctr., CIVIL ACTION NO.: 4:19-cv-122, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94424, 2020 WL 2815122, at *13 (S.D. Ga. May 29, 2020) (citation omitted). Thus, "[t]o decide whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, district courts use a two-step framework," with the "first step" involving the identification of "the allegations that are no more than conclusions," since "[c]onclusory allegations are not entitled to the assumption of truth." Barreth v. Reyes 1, Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. 5:19-cv-00320-TES, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134806, 2020 WL 4370137, at *2 (M.D. Ga. July 29, 2020) (citation and internal marks omitted). "After disregarding the conclusory allegations, the second step is to assume any remaining factual allegations are true and determine whether those factual allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief." Id. (citation and internal marks omitted). "A court decides whether [Rule 8's pleading standard] is met by separating the legal conclusions from the factual allegations, assuming the truth of only the factual allegations, and then determining whether those allegations allow the court to reasonably infer that the plaintiff is entitled to the legal remedy sought." Id. (alteration in original) (citation and internal marks omitted).
"While Rule 12(b)(6) does not permit dismissal of a well-pleaded [*9]  complaint simply because 'it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable,'" Watts v. Fla. Int'l Univ., 495 F.3d 1289, 1295 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556), "[t]o state a plausible claim for relief, [Perry ] must go beyond merely pleading the 'sheer possibility' of unlawful activity by [Don Park] and so must offer 'factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that [Don Park] is liable for the misconduct alleged,'" Stabb v. GMAC Mortg., LLC, 579 F. App'x 706, 708 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); see also S. River Watershed All., Inc. v. DeKalb Cty., 484 F. Supp. 3d 1353, 1364 (N.D. Ga. 2020) (citation and internal marks omitted) ("The plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully."); Evans v. Ga. Dep't of Behavioral Health & Developmental Disabilities, CV 415-103, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164402, 2018 WL 4610630, at *3 (S.D. Ga. Sept. 25, 2018) (alterations in original) (citation and internal marks omitted) ("Although there is no probability requirement at the pleading stage, something beyond . . . mere possibility . . . must be alleged."). "This necessarily requires that [Perry ] include factual allegations for each essential element of his . . . claim." GeorgiaCarry.Org, Inc. v. Georgia, 687 F.3d 1244, 1254 (11th Cir. 2012) (citations omitted).5 "Regardless of the alleged facts, however, a court may dismiss a complaint on a dispositive issue of law." Moore v. McCalla Raymer, LLC, 916 F. Supp. 2d 1332, 1342 (N.D. Ga. 2013), adopted at 1336 (citations and internal marks omitted); see also Glover v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (citation omitted); [*10]  Marshall Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Marshall Cty. Gas Dist., 992 F.2d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir. 1993) (citations omitted).

III. DISCUSSION
Don Park moves to dismiss all of Perry's claims asserted against it in his original complaint. [Doc. 7]. Perry has filed a first amended complaint, [Doc. 11], and a response to Don Park's motion to dismiss, [Doc. 12], but because Don Park contests the timeliness of the filing of the first amended complaint and the response, see [Doc. 13], the Court will first address whether Perry's first amended complaint is properly before the Court before turning to the merits of the motion to dismiss.

A. Timeliness of Perry's Amended Complaint and Response to Don Park's Motion to Dismiss
Perry filed this action against Don Park on July 23, 2020, [Doc. 1], and on September 14, 2020, Don Park moved to dismiss Perry's complaint, [Doc. 7]. On September 25, 2020, the parties filed a "Consent Motion for Extension of Time for [Perry] to Respond to [Don Park's] Motion to Dismiss [his] Complaint for Failure to State a Claim," [Doc. 8 (emphasis and all caps omitted)], in which Perry requested that "this Court extend the deadline to respond to the Motion to Dismiss by two weeks, from September 28, 2020, up to and including October 12, 2020," [id. at 2]. On September [*11]  28, 2020, this Court entered an Order, granting the parties' consent motion and ordering that "the deadline for [Perry] to respond to [Don Park's] motion to dismiss [] be extended through and including October 12, 2020," and that the "deadline for [Don Park's] reply [be] extended to October 26, 2020." [Doc. 9 (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted)]. Perry, however, did not file his response to Don Park's motion to dismiss until October 13, 2020, see [Doc. 12], one-day after the extended deadline had passed, see [Doc. 9], and he did not request an extension prior to filing his untimely response, nor did he offer an explanation for its untimeliness.
In addition, on October 13, 2020, Perry also filed a first amended complaint. [Doc. 11]. "Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a plaintiff to file one amended complaint as a matter of course, if the amended complaint is filed either within 21 days of service of the original complaint or within 21 days of the defendant's filing of a responsive pleading or Rule 12 motion to dismiss." Fresh v. Diamond Dev. Invs., Inc., No. 1:13-cv-2657-WSD, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29017, 2015 WL 1046128, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 9, 2015) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)). "Amended complaints outside of these time limits may be filed only 'with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.'" [*12]  Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2)).
As previously stated, Don Park filed its motion to dismiss on September 14, 2020, [Doc. 7], and "[p]ursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, [Perry] then had 21 days from the date of service of that motion to file an amended complaint as a matter of course," Stripland v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Civil Action No. 2:16-CV-00152-RWS-JCF, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163829, 2016 WL 7007557, at *11 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 3, 2016), adopted by 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163317, 2016 WL 7007510, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 28, 2016) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B)). "Otherwise, [he was] required to obtain leave of court or [Don Park's] permission to file an amended complaint." Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2)). Perry, however, did not file his first amended complaint until October 13, 2020, see [Doc. 11], and as Don Park points out, [Doc. 13 at 1 n.1], this was well after 21 days from the date of service of the motion to dismiss, see [Doc. 7], and an extension of the deadline to file an amended complaint was not requested in the consent motion for an extension, see [Doc. 8], nor was it authorized by the Court in its Order granting the consent motion, see [Doc. 9]. To the extent Perry construed the consent motion for an extension of time to respond to Don Park's motion to dismiss as also including an extension of time for him to file an amended complaint, the motion still only requested an extension of the deadline up to and including October 12, 2020, see [Doc. 8], and the Court likewise only authorized [*13]  an extension of the deadline though and including October 12, 2020, see [Doc. 9], and his first amended complaint filed on October 13, 2020, [Doc. 11], is therefore still untimely.
Because Perry did not "seek the Court's leave to file or show that [Don Park] consented to the amendment," his first amended complaint "is due to be stricken because it was not filed within the time provided for filing an amended pleading as a matter of course and because [he] did not obtain the Court's leave prior to filing." Stripland, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163829, 2016 WL 7007557, at *11; see also Oliver v. M/V Barbary Coast, No. CA 11-223-KD-C, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98176, 2012 WL 2898055, at *4 n.4 (S.D. Ala. June 13, 2012), adopted as modified by 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98181, 2012 WL 2891777, at *1 (S.D. Ala. July 16, 2012) (noting that it was proper for the court to sua sponte strike an amended complaint that was improperly filed); Thayse v. Anderson, No. 2:06-cv-38-FtM-29DNF, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83086, 2006 WL 3313750, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 14, 2006). Therefore, the Clerk is DIRECTED to STRIKE Perry's first amended complaint, [Doc. 11], from the docket. See Jensen v. Defenders Sec. Co., CIVIL ACTION FILE NO. 1:17-CV-03693-TWT-AJB, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138995, 2018 WL 3910851, at *2 (N.D. Ga. July 25, 2018), adopted by 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138989, 2018 WL 3872777, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 15, 2018) (footnotes and citation omitted) (directing the Clerk to strike plaintiff's first amended complaint since he failed to request leave to amend his complaint and there was no written consent to the amendment on the docket and therefore the amended complaint was "improperly filed, and [was] a nullity"); see also [*14]  Hunt v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, CIVIL ACTION FILE NO. 1:20-cv-02359-TWT-LTW, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25936, 2021 WL 456626, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 13, 2021), adopted by 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25935, 2021 WL 456625, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 2, 2021) (citation and internal marks omitted) (explaining that the Court struck plaintiff's amended complaint as a legal nullity since he "had no legal basis for filing [it]"). Accordingly, Perry's original complaint, [Doc. 1], remains the operative pleading in this case, and the Court will now consider Don Park's motion to dismiss Perry's original complaint for failure to state a claim, [Doc. 7].6

B. Merits of Perry's Claims Alleged in his Original Complaint
Don Park moves to dismiss all of Perry's claims asserted against it in his original complaint, presenting several arguments in support of its motion. See [Doc. 7]. First, Don Park argues that Perry's ADA disability discrimination claim asserted in Count I fails because he has not sufficiently alleged that he has a disability as defined under the ADA, and that even if his allegations are sufficient to allege that he has a disability within the purview of the ADA, he has failed to sufficiently state a claim that his termination was based on his disability. [Doc. 7-1 at 6-11]. Don Park also asserts that Perry's ADA failure to accommodate claim [*15]  asserted in Count II of his original complaint is due to be dismissed because he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to this claim, but that even if he had, he has still failed to state a plausible claim as a matter of law. [Id. at 11-14]. Finally, Don Park argues that Perry has failed to allege sufficient facts to support his ADA retaliation claim asserted in Count III as he has neither shown that he engaged in statutorily protected activity, nor has he shown a causal link between any purported protected activity and his termination. [Id. at 14-18]. The Court will address these arguments in evaluating the merits of each of Perry's claims.

1. ADA Discrimination Claim
In Count I of his original complaint, Perry alleges that Don Park was aware that he had a physical impairment within the meaning of the ADA that limited one or more major life activities, that it regarded him as having a disability within the meaning of the ADA or that he had a record of having a disability within the meaning of the ADA, that he was a qualified individual with a known or perceived disability as defined by the ADA, and that Don Park terminated his "employment because of his disability, perceived [*16]  disability, or record of having a disability." [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 32-38]. He further alleges that Don Park terminated his "employment shortly after [he] complained of harassment due to his disability," that Don Park "treated other employees outside [his] protected class differently," and that by "terminating [his] employment because of his disability, perceived disability, or record of having a disability, [Don Park] violated the ADA, as amended." [Id. ¶¶ 39-40, 42].
Don Park asserts that Perry has failed to state a plausible claim for disability discrimination under the ADA because he "has not sufficiently alleged that he has a disability" as defined under the ADA based on his diagnosis of MS, or that he was a qualified individual within the meaning of the ADA since he offered "only conclusory allegations on [that] point." [Doc. 7-1 at 5-8 & n.2 (citations omitted)]. Don Park also argues that Perry's conclusory allegations that he was terminated because of his disability without more are insufficient to state a claim under the ADA. [Id. at 9-11].
"A complaint in an employment discrimination case need not contain specific facts establishing a prima facie case under the evidentiary framework [*17]  for such cases to survive a motion to dismiss."7 Henderson v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 436 F. App'x 935, 937 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 510, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002)). However, "complaints alleging discrimination still must meet the 'plausibility standard' of Twombly and Iqbal." Id. (citation omitted). Thus, Perry's complaint has "to contain 'sufficient factual matter' to support a reasonable inference that [Don Park] engaged in [disability] discrimination against [him.]" Id. In fact, "a complaint that 'provides no . . . detail manifesting any form of [] animus, discriminatory words, prior incidents or other indications that [Perry's disability] played a role in [the employer's] decision to dismiss [him]' is insufficient to satisfy the minimum pleading standards of Rule 8(a)(2)." Jacobs v. Biando, No. 1:12-cv-4432-WSD, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89261, 2013 WL 3243625, at *7 (N.D. Ga. June 26, 2013), aff'd, 592 F. App'x 838 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (unpublished) (first and fourth alterations in original) (citation omitted). "To survive a motion to dismiss, [Perry's] complaint must offer more than naked assertions that [Don Park] acted unlawfully or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action." Graveling v. Castle Mortg. Co., 631 F. App'x 690, 693 (11th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (citation omitted).
"The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating 'against a qualified individual [*18]  with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.'" Gaynor v. Atlanta Pub. Sch., CIVIL ACTION FILE NO. 1:17-cv-03562-TWT-AJB, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137213, 2018 WL 3849871, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 27, 2018), adopted by 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136399, 2018 WL 3833443, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 13, 2018) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). "In order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, [Perry ] must show that: (1) []he is disabled;8 ] (2) []he was a qualified individual at the relevant time, meaning that []he could perform the essential functions of the job in question with or without reasonable accommodations; and (3) []he was discriminated against because of [his] disability." Id. (citations omitted). Thus, in "addition to establishing that he was disabled and a qualified individual, [Perry] must also allege facts demonstrating that his discharge was based on his disability." Hein v. IMS Gear Holding, Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:16-CV-00081-RWS-JCF, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112965, 2018 WL 1833254, at *20 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 31, 2018), adopted by 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112964, 2018 WL 1882813, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 27, 2018) (citation omitted). "In other words, [Perry, who is] complaining of discriminatory discharge under the ADA[,] must show that his . . . employer would not have fired him but for his actual or perceived disability," [*19]  though he "is not required to establish that his disability was the sole basis for his discrimination, but need only show that his disability was a determinative factor." Id. (citations and internal marks omitted).
Don Park contends that Perry has failed to sufficiently allege that he has a disability, [Doc. 7-1 at 6-8], but for purposes of its motion to dismiss, the Court will presume that Perry's allegations that he was diagnosed with MS, that his supervisor was aware of his diagnosis and monthly treatments for his MS, and that his MS limited one or more of his major life activities are sufficient at this stage to show that he has a disability within the purview of the ADA, see [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 12, 14, 17, 32]; see also Bacon v. Frazier, CV419-300, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22822, 2020 WL 624281, at *4 (S.D. Ga. Feb. 10, 2020), adopted by 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57715, 2020 WL 1558107, at *1 (S.D. Ga. Apr. 1, 2020); Nattiel v. Tomlinson, Case No. 1:15-cv-150-WTH-GRJ, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195152, 2017 WL 5799233, at *6 (N.D. Fla. July 13, 2017), adopted by 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194717, 2017 WL 5774143, at *1 (N.D. Fla. Nov. 28, 2017). However, Don Park also argues that Perry's disability discrimination claim fails because although he "alleges that he was terminated because of his disability, perceived, or record of having a disability," in "the absence of an averment of facts which, taken as true, support an inference of discrimination, []his conclusory allegation constitutes mere speculation and fails to state a claim," [Doc. 7-1 at 9 (citation and internal marks omitted)], [*20]  and the Court agrees.
In support of its argument for dismissal, Don Park relies on the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Andrews v. City of Hartford, 700 F. App'x 924 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (unpublished), see [Doc. 7-1 at 9-10], and following a review of the Andrews case, the Court finds the circumstances present in that case factually indistinguishable from the present case and agrees that it supports dismissal of Perry's ADA disability discrimination claim. In Andrews, the plaintiff's "complaint alleged that his coworkers harassed him because of his diabetes, that the [defendant] failed to make accommodations to address the harassment, and that it then fired him in spite of his excellent job performance," but it did not allege any plausible facts as follows:
(1) concerning the [defendant's] official(s) who decided to fire him and why the(se) person(s) believed his diabetes significantly restricted him from one or more major life activities, including working; (2) showing how his diabetes . . . or being 'regarded as' having a disability was a 'determinative factor' in the termination decision; or (3) otherwise giving rise to an inference of disability discrimination.
700 F. App'x at 927. The Eleventh Circuit therefore concluded that even if it assumed "that the [*21]  district court should have concluded that [plaintiff] was 'regarded as' disabled under the ADA[] and that he was qualified for the position he was fired from," he "made only the conclusory statement that he was fired because of his disability, which was not sufficient to state a discrimination claim." Id. at 926-27 (citations omitted).
Similarly, in the present case, as Don Park points out, Perry "has not alleged any plausible facts showing that the decisionmaker(s) believed [his] MS diagnosis or symptoms significantly restricted [him] from one or more major life activities and has not stated how his MS diagnosis or being 'regarded as' having MS was a determinative factor in the termination decision." [Doc. 7-1 at 10 (footnotes omitted)]. Like the complaint at issue in Andrews, Perry has simply alleged that his co-workers harassed him "due to his illness," that he complained about the harassment, and that he was then terminated purportedly due to a lack of work, [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 20-21, 24-26, 28, 39], but Perry has not set forth any allegations in his complaint as to who made the decision to terminate his employment, or if this individual, or individuals, had any knowledge of his alleged disability or [*22]  how his disability "or being 'regarded as' having a disability was a 'determinative factor' in the termination decision," Andrews, 700 F. App'x at 927; see generally [Doc. 1]; see also Rhodes v. Hancock Cty., CASE NO. 5:18-CV-22 (MTT), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207634, 2018 WL 6496773, at *3 (M.D. Ga. Dec. 10, 2018) (emphasis, citation, and internal marks omitted) ("An employer that lacks actual knowledge of an employee's disability cannot fire the employee because of that disability.").9 "Overall, [Perry's] allegations are too tenuous and conclusory to support [his] claims," and while he "may have shown the mere possibility of misconduct, []he has not shown an entitlement to relief." Wagner v. Demo Sales, Inc., Case No. 8:20-CV-185-T-36SPF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87936, 2020 WL 2527230, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 28, 2020), adopted by 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86785, 2020 WL 2523565, at *1 (M.D. Fla. May 18, 2020) (citations and internal marks omitted); see also Davis v. Delta Airlines, Inc., Civil Action No. 18-25361-Civ-Scola, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 191371, 2019 WL 5742150, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 5, 2019) (alterations, citation, and internal marks omitted) (finding dismissal of plaintiff's disability discrimination claim was warranted where her complaint failed to "include facts supporting the conclusory allegations that her supervisors were aware of her disability or that her disability was a determinative factor in the termination decision," but instead she "made only the conclusory statement that she was fired because of her disability, which [was] not sufficient to state a discrimination claim"). Perry "must connect the adverse employment [*23]  action to [his] disability," Hargett v. Fla. Atl. Univ. Bd. of Trs., Case No.: 9:15-cv-80349-CIV-RYSKAMP/HOPKINS, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 191860, 2015 WL 13639189, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 15, 2015), which he has failed to do. Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Don Park's motion to dismiss Perry's disability discrimination claim asserted under the ADA in Count I of his original complaint be GRANTED.

2. ADA Failure to Accommodate Claim
In Count II of his original complaint, Perry asserts a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA. [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 51-66]. As Don Park points out, Perry "abandoned his ADA failure to accommodate claim in his [untimely first a]mended [c]omplaint and did not address that claim in his [untimely r]esponse to the [m]otion to [d]ismiss," [Doc. 13 at 2], and the "[f]ailure to respond to an opposing party's argument constitutes abandonment of that claim and warrants its dismissal," Demmons v. Fulton Cty., Civil Action File No. 1:09-CV-2312-TWT-WEJ, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90829, 2010 WL 3418325, at *11 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 2, 2010), adopted by 2010 U.S. Dist.

Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995)) ("When a party fails to respond to an argument or otherwise address a claim, the Court deems such argument or claim abandoned.").

GA Dep't of Motor Vehicle Safety, Civil Action File No. 1:06-CV-0124-TWT, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36497, 2006 WL 1466254, at *1 (N.D. Ga. May 19, 2006), adopted at *1; see also Trainer v. Nix, Civil Action No. 1:07-CV-1227-JOF, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67959, 2009 WL 2370677, at *1 (N.D. Ga. July 29, 2009) (considering merits of defendants' motions even though they were unopposed); Eley v. Morris, 390 F. Supp. 913, 917-18 (N.D. Ga. 1975) (evaluating plaintiffs' motions on the merits despite defendants' failure to file responses in opposition).
Don Park contends that Perry failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies before filing a civil claim for the alleged failure to accommodate under the ADA, [Doc. 7-1 at 11-13], and "[i]n order to litigate a claim for discrimination under . . . the ADA, . . . [Perry] must first exhaust his administrative remedies, beginning with filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC," Rizo v. Ala. Dep't of Human Res., 228 F. App'x 832, 835 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); see also Brady v. Postmaster Gen., U.S. Postal Serv., 521 F. App'x 914, 916 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citations omitted); Fry v. Muscogee Cty. Sch. Dist., 150 F. App'x 980, 981-82 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (unpublished) [*25]  (citations omitted); Hammond v. Georgia, Civil Action No. 2:11-CV-00051-RWS, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7318, 2012 WL 181647, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 23, 2012) (citation omitted). Under the ADA, "an employee is required to file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination," Maxwell v. Inner Harbour, Ltd., Civil Action No. 1:08-CV-2925-RWS, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33574, 2009 WL 1045478, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 20, 2009) (citation omitted); see also Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 109 (2002)10 ; Abram v. Fulton Cty. Gov't, 598 F. App'x 672, 674 (11th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citations omitted) ("For an EEOC charge to be timely in . . . Georgia, the charge must be filed within 180 days of when the alleged violation occurred."),11 and "[i]f an employee fails to file an EEOC charge before the 180-day limitations period elapses, [his] subsequent lawsuit is procedurally barred and must be dismissed for failure to exhaust [his] administrative remedies," Scott v. Shoe Show, Inc., 38 F. Supp. 3d 1343, 1356 (N.D. Ga. 2014), adopted at 1348 (citation and internal marks omitted).
Moreover, although a plaintiff's failure to include allegations of a particular type of discrimination or discriminatory act in an EEOC charge does not necessarily preclude a judicial complaint based on such allegations, "the 'scope' of the judicial complaint is limited to the 'scope' of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination." Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970)12 ; see also Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 926 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) [*26]  (unpublished) (citation omitted); Chanda v. Engelhard/ICC, 234 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir. 2000); Dickey v. Crawford Cty. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 5:10-cv-356 (CAR), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11792, 2011 WL 482716, at *3 (M.D. Ga. Feb. 7, 2011) (citation omitted); Brandon v. Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Sys., 393 F. Supp. 2d 1341, 1356 (N.D. Ga. 2005) (citations omitted). "When considering the extent of a reasonable investigation by the EEOC, courts begin with the EEOC charge itself, with a particular focus on the factual statement contained therein." Freeman v. Koch Foods of Ala., 777 F. Supp. 2d 1264, 1277 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (citation omitted). "Claims that amplify, clarify, or more clearly focus earlier complaints are appropriate, but [a]llegations of new acts of discrimination, offered as the essential basis for the requested judicial review are not appropriate." Gay v. AirTran Airways, Inc., 427 F. App'x 743, 745 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (alteration in original) (citations and internal marks omitted). Finally, "where a defendant in a[n] . . . ADA discrimination case asserts that the plaintiff has not satisfied all conditions precedent to filing suit, including . . . the timely filing of an EEOC [c]harge, the plaintiff 'bears the burden of proving that the conditions precedent . . . have been satisfied[.]'" Jackson v. Meadwestvaco Coated Bd., Inc., No. 3:09-cv-695-MEF, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108521, 2010 WL 4000614, at *5 (M.D. Ala. Sept. 22, 2010), adopted by 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108825, 2010 WL 3999084, at *1 (M.D. Ala. Oct. 12, 2010) (fifth alteration in original) (citations omitted); Kerr v. McDonald's Corp., 333 F. Supp. 2d 1352, 1358 (N.D. Ga. 2004) (citations omitted), aff'd, 427 F.3d 947 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam).
Perry identified disability discrimination and retaliation as the bases for his April 15, 2020, EEOC charge, and he specifically alleged as follows:
I. I began working for the employer [*27]  in March 2019 as a sheet metal worker. I was complimented on my abilities and praised for my skills. In May 2019, I began treatment for [MS]. In July 2019, I applied for and was approved for intermittent leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). My supervisor, [] Houston, and coworkers began to harass me for taking time off to address my illness. I was cursed at, threatened, and physically assaulted. On October 11, 2019, I went to my supervisor after being threatened again and complained about the continuous harassment because of my disability and my need [] for FMLA leave. Houston told me that I had to deal with it and that it was my problem. Houston told the union steward, [] Chappell, to instruct everyone not to talk to me. On October 16, 2019, I again went to Houston and Chappell about the harassment. On October 18, 2019, I was terminated.
II. The employer stated I was terminated due to lack of work, although the company had just hired 5 people for the shipping and sheet metal departments.
III. I believe I was discriminated and retaliated against in violation of the [ADA and] Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964[.]
[Doc. 7-2 at 2].
In Count II of his complaint, Perry alleges that Don Park failed to provide reasonable accommodations in violation [*28]  of the ADA. [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 51-66]. Generally, a plaintiff asserting a claim of employment discrimination cannot bring any claim in a lawsuit that he did not include in his EEOC charge or that was not like or related to the claims asserted by him in the EEOC charge. Collins v. Fulton Cty. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 1:12-CV-1299-ODE-JSA, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187392, 2012 WL 7802745, at *14 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 26, 2012) (citations omitted); Gary v. Menlo Logistics Global Transp. Servs., Inc., Civil Action No. 1:06-CV-2139-TWT, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10251, 2007 WL 528096, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 13, 2007), adopted at *1 (citations omitted). Don Park contends that "[n]owhere [in the EEOC charge] does [Perry] state that he requested accommodations for his disability and that [it] denied such requests." [Doc. 7-1 at 12]. Indeed, all of the factual allegations in Perry's EEOC charge pertain to his alleged harassment by co-workers and his discharge, with no mention of any failure to accommodate. See [Doc. 7-2 at 2]; see also Green v. Elixir Indus., Inc., 152 F. App'x 838, 840-41 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (unpublished). Because Perry did not include in his EEOC charge any allegations regarding the alleged failure to provide reasonable accommodations that preceded his discharge, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies for his ADA failure to accommodate claim. Nelson v. PMTD Rests., LLC, No. 3:12-cv-369-MEF, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111763, 2013 WL 4045086, at *8 (M.D. Ala. Aug. 8, 2013).13 Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that Perry's claim for failure to provide reasonable accommodations under the ADA be DISMISSED as it appears that he has abandoned any such [*29]  claim, but even if he has not, he failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to this claim.14

3. ADA Retaliation Claim
In Count III of his original complaint, Perry alleges that he has "mental health impairments which substantially limit one of more major life activities including but not limited to concentrating, thinking and working"; that his "mental health impairments are 'disabilities' within the meaning of the ADA, as amended"; that Don Park was "aware of [his] disabilities"; that he "was a qualified individual with a known or perceived disability as defined in the ADA"; that Don Park terminated him "for requesting an accommodation for his disability and/or perceived disability"; that his "request for an accommodation . . . constitutes protected conduct under the ADA, as amended"; and that Don Park "retaliated against [him] by terminating his employment on the basis of his request for an accommodation." [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 68-74]. Perry also alleges that Don Park "terminated [his] employment within a close temporal proximity to [his] accommodation requests." [Id. ¶ 75].
"The ADA provides that '[n]o person shall [*30]  discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a charge . . . under [the ADA].'" Townsend v. Staples, Inc., 1:15-cv-2835-WSD, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78249, 2016 WL 3344579, at *4 (N.D. Ga. June 15, 2016) (alterations in original) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a)). "To state a claim under this provision, [Perry] must show that (1) []he engaged in conduct protected by the ADA; (2) []he was subjected to an adverse employment action at the time, or after the protected conduct took place; and (3) [Don Park] took the adverse employment action against [him] because of [his] protected conduct." Id. (citation and internal marks omitted). "Critically, to state a claim for retaliation, [Perry] must adequately allege that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action[]." Ramsey v. Greenbush Logistics, Inc., Civil Action Number 3:17-cv-01167-AKK, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207880, 2017 WL 6492608, at *5 (N.D. Ala. Dec. 19, 2017) (citation and internal marks omitted). "However, because the prima facie case for retaliation constitutes an evidentiary standard rather than a pleading requirement, [Perry] need only allege adequate facts to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2) by stating a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207880, [WL] at *5 (citations and internal marks omitted).
Don Park argues that Perry has failed to state a plausible claim for retaliation under the ADA because he has failed [*31]  to allege that he engaged in statutorily protected activity. [Doc. 7-1 at 15-16]. In particular, Don Park asserts that for Perry's "requests for accommodation of his MS to constitute statutorily protected activity, he must show that he had a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that he was entitled to those accommodations under the ADA," but that here, Perry "has merely asserted that his MS [was] a qualifying disability without alleging any grounds for that conclusion" and he "has failed to state a claim that he requested any accommodation for that alleged disability." [Id. at 15 (citation and internal marks omitted)].15 Don Park further argues that Perry's ADA retaliation claim is due to be dismissed because he has failed to allege a causal link between any purported statutorily protected activity and his termination. [Id. at 16-18].
"[R]equesting a reasonable accommodation may be protected activity under the ADA. . . . if the plaintiff can show that []he had a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that []he was entitled to such accommodations under the ADA[]." Phillips v. Harbor Venice Mgmt., LLC, Case No. 8:19-cv-2379-T-33TGW, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15061, 2020 WL 495224, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 30, 2020) (citations omitted). However, "it is [*32]  unclear from the vague allegations in the complaint what specific reasonable accommodations [Perry] requested and when." Id. (citation omitted); see generally [Doc. 1]. In fact, in his general factual allegations, Perry alleged that he was provided with a request for accommodations related to his treatment for MS from his treating physician in June 2019, and that he requested to return to his normal workstation where there was a fan because the summer heat exacerbated his MS, [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 15-18], but his retaliation claim alleges that he has "mental health impairments," [id. ¶¶ 68-69],16 yet he has not set forth any allegations that he requested accommodations for his "mental health impairments," see Maira v. Sti-Co Indus., Inc., Case No. 1-20-cv-00447-LJV-JJM, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36001, 2021 WL 1229598, at *7-9 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2021), adopted by 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62932, 2021 WL 1226431, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2021) (finding plaintiff failed to plead an ADA claim where he failed to allege he requested an accommodation for his PTSD during the relevant time, as well as for other alleged impairments, including his anxiety); see also Richardson, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32754, 2019 WL 1002597, at *8 (finding plaintiff failed to state a claim under the ADA where her complaint did not allege that she requested an accommodation "or explain how her unspecified mental health condition could be accommodated"), [*33]  and despite his general conclusory assertion that Don Park "was aware of [his] disabilities," [id. ¶ 70], he only specifically alleged that he made his supervisor, Houston, aware of his MS diagnosis, not of any alleged mental health impairment, [id. ¶¶ 12-14]; see also Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted) ("A decision maker cannot have been motivated to retaliate by something unknown to him."). Thus, Perry has failed to allege plausibly that he engaged in protected activity. See Ibrahim v. Pena, 16-CV-7774 (VEC), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133391, 2017 WL 3601246, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2017).17 Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Don Park's motion to dismiss Perry's ADA retaliation claim asserted in Count III of his original complaint be GRANTED.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Clerk is DIRECTED to STRIKE Perry's first amended complaint, [Doc. 11], from the docket, and it is RECOMMENDED that Don Park's motion to dismiss the original complaint, [Doc. 7], be GRANTED and that this case be DISMISSED.
The Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate this referral.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED and DIRECTED this 28th day of April, 2021.
