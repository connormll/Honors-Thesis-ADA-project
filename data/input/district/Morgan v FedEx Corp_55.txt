Opinion



ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Now before the Court is the motion filed by Defendant Federal Express d/b/a FedEx Express ("FedEx") for summary judgment. The Court finds these matters appropriate for disposition without oral argument and the matter is deemed submitted. See N.D. Civ. L.R. 7-1(b). Accordingly, the hearing set for February 18, 2011 is HEREBY VACATED. Having carefully considered the parties' papers and the relevant legal authority, the Court HEREBY GRANTS FedEx's motion for summary judgment.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff brought suit against FedEx alleging disability discrimination, failure to provide reasonable accommodations, and failure to engage in interactive process, all in violation [*2]  of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a), et. seq.
In her complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she was a part-time mail handler for FedEx beginning on March 19, 2007. (Complaint at ¶ 8.) In April 2007, Plaintiff began to experience shortness of breath and, in July 2007, she became physically disabled from a heart condition and went on medical leave starting on July 19, 2007. (Id. at ¶ 9.) On January 16, 2008, Plaintiff's health care provider cleared her to return to work subject to a single restriction that she not lift packages over 40 pounds. (Id. at ¶ 11; Declaration of Kathy L. Cline ("Cline Decl.") at ¶ 22, Ex. F; (Declaration of Davis S. Wilson III ("Wilson Decl."), Ex. A at 90.) Plaintiff alleges that FedEx refused all reasonable accommodation requests and then terminated her employment on February 7, 2008 pursuant to an unlawful policy. (Compl. at ¶¶ 13-14.) Plaintiff alleges that FedEx has a policy providing that "employees with less than one year of continuous service are allowed a maximum of six months for medical leave of absence and are automatically terminated upon the expiration of that maximum leave ('the Policy')." (Id. at ¶ 14.)
According to Plaintiff, the position [*3]  of mail handler at FedEx requires, among other things, being able to load and unload aircraft and containers. (Wilson Decl. at Ex. A22 at 166-67.) The summary of the position is "to provide movement of packages, documents, dangerous goods and/or supply support in a timely, safe and efficient manner through effective scan/load methods." (Id. at 166.) The undisputed record indicates that a mail handler processes packages in excess of 40 pounds and often will not know the weight of the package until it requires handling it. (Declaration of Kary T. Baddour ("Baddour Decl.") at ¶¶ 6, 9, 17.)
The Court will address any additional facts in the remainder of this Order.

ANALYSIS

A. Applicable Legal Standards on Motion for Summary Judgment.
A principal purpose of the summary judgment procedure is to identify and dispose of factually unsupported claims. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Summary judgment is proper when the "pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court may not weigh the [*4]  evidence or make credibility determinations, and is required to draw all inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party." Freeman v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997).
The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of identifying those portions of the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. An issue of fact is "genuine" only if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact finder to find for the non-moving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A fact is "material" if it may affect the outcome of the case. Id. at 248. If the party moving for summary judgment does not have the ultimate burden of persuasion at trial, that party must produce evidence which either negates an essential element of the non-moving party's claims or that party must show that the non-moving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial. Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000). Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and, by its own evidence, "set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).
In order to make this showing, the non-moving party must "identify with reasonable particularity [*5]  the evidence that precludes summary judgment." Keenan v. Allan, 91 F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. 1996). In addition, the party seeking to establish a genuine issue of material fact must take care adequately to point the court to the evidence precluding summary judgment because a court is "'not required to comb the record to find some reason to deny a motion for summary judgment.'" Carmen v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting Forsberg v. Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co., 840 F.2d 1409, 1418 (9th Cir. 1988)). If the non-moving party fails to point to evidence precluding summary judgment, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.

B. Claim for Disability Discrimination.
Under the FEHA, it is unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge an individual from employment because of a physical disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). Disability discrimination claims under the FEHA are evaluated using a "shifting burden" analysis. Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 356, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). First, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. If the plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case, summary judgment for the employer is warranted. If the plaintiff does establish a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Once the defendant does so, the plaintiff may "attack the employer's proffered reasons [*6]  as pretexts for discriminatory motive." Id.
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she suffers from a disability; (2) with or without reasonable accommodation, she could perform the essential functions of the employment position held or desired; (3) she was subjected to an adverse employment action; (4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances raising an inference of discrimination. Id. at 355.
At summary judgment, the degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case is "minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence." Lyons v. England, 307 F.3d 1092, 1112 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994)); see also Caldwell v. Paramount Unified Sch. Dist., 41 Cal. App. 4th 189, 197, 48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 448 (1996) (holding that a plaintiff's evidentiary burden to establish a prima facie case is "minimal").
Under the FEHA, an employer is not prohibited from refusing to hire or discharge an employee with a physical or mental disability who is "unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations, or cannot perform those duties in a manner that would not endanger his or her health or safety of the health or safety of others even with the reasonable accommodation." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(1). In "disability discrimination actions, the [*7]  plaintiff has not shown the defendant has done anything wrong until the plaintiff can show he or she was able to do the job with or without reasonable accommodation." Green v. State of California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 265, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007).
Here, Plaintiff is unable to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because she cannot demonstrate that she is able to perform the essential duties of her position. According to her own health care provider, Plaintiff was unable to lift in excess of 40 pounds. (. (Compl. at ¶ 11; Cline Decl. at ¶ 22, Ex. F; Wilson Decl., Ex. A at 90.) The essential duties of a handler is "to provide movement of packages, documents, dangerous goods and/or supply support in a timely, safe and efficient manner through effective scan/load methods." (Id., Ex. A22 at 166.) The undisputed record establishes that it is impossible to estimate with any accuracy the weight of the packages regularly encountered by mail handlers. (Baddour Decl. at ¶¶ 6, 9, 17.) In addition, the evidence reveals that there are a significant number of packages that pass through the Oakland Hub that weigh in excess of 40 pounds. (Id. at ¶¶ 16-18.) Accordingly, it is undisputed that had Plaintiff been returned to work as a mail handler at the Oakland [*8]  Hub, she would have been required to lift and move packages heavier than the lifting restriction prescribed by her cardiologist. Although the job description also included other functions, it is undisputed that Plaintiff could not perform one of the listed essential duties of the position.1
Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case for employment discrimination on the basis of disability and that claim is dismissed.

C. Claim for Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations.
In her second claim for relief, Plaintiff asserts that FedEx failed to reasonably accommodate her physical disability. Under the FEHA, it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to "fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). A "reasonable accommodation" includes "[j]ob restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other accommodation for individuals with disabilities." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(n)(2).
An employer is not required [*9]  to choose the best accommodation or the specific accommodation that a disabled employee seeks. Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 228, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). Further, there is no obligation for the employer to promote the disabled employee. See id. The FEHA only requires that the accommodation chosen be "reasonable." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a), (m). The obligation to reassign an employee who cannot otherwise be accommodated "does not require creating a new job, moving another employee, or violating another employee's rights under a collective bargaining agreement." Hastings v. Dept. of Corrections, 110 Cal. App. 4th 963, 972, 2 Cal. Rptr. 3d 329 (2003) (citation omitted). Furthermore, the FEHA does not require that the employer create a new position for an employee, or a temporary light-duty assignment where no such position existed previously. Watkins v. Ameripride Servs., 375 F.3d 821, 828-29 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1227, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899 (2006). Finally, an employer is not required to eliminate "essential functions" of a job, or reallocate them to other employees. Wilmarth v. City of Santa Rosa, 945 F. Supp. 1271, 1278 (N.D. Cal. 1996). What is required is "the duty to reassign a disabled employee if an already funded, vacant position at the same level exists." Hastings, 110 Cal. App. 4th at 972-73 (citations omitted).
For the same reasons the Court has already found that Plaintiff cannot establish a disability discrimination claim, she cannot prevail on a failure to provide reasonable accommodation. The Court has already found that Plaintiff was not able [*10]  to demonstrate that she could perform the essential functions of her former position during the period of her disability. Defendant was not required to create a new position with different essential functions or to promote Plaintiff to another position when she lacked the necessary qualifications.

D. Claim for Failure to Engage in Interactive Process.
Under the FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer to "fail to engage in a timely, good faith interactive process" with a disabled employee to determine effective reasonable accommodations. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). In order to prevail on such a claim, the employee must demonstrate that the employer had, but did not provide, a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed the employee to perform the essential functions of her position. See Scotch v. Art Institute of California, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1019, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (holding that there can be no liability for failure to engage in the interactive process in an effort to identify a reasonable accommodation when a reasonable accommodation was, in fact, provided because in those circumstances a remedial injury was not suffered).
Plaintiff was afforded unpaid medical leave starting on July 25, 2007. Under FedEx's Policy, Plaintiff was entitled to have the handler position preserved for 90 [*11]  days. Because Plaintiff had worked for FedEx less than one year, she was eligible for 180 days of unpaid medical leave, during which time her employment and medical insurance was preserved. (Cline Decl. at ¶¶ 8, 9, 13.)
The record is replete with evidence that FedEx was engaged with Plaintiff during the period of his disability, furnishing her with alternative job opportunities that did not require the same physical capabilities. (See, e.g., id. at ¶¶ 10, 15.) Although Plaintiff was interested in positions that she failed to qualify for and was not given a promotion, there is no contrary evidence indicating that FedEx failed to engage in an interactive process with Plaintiff in an effort to locate for her an alternative position during his temporary disability. (See id. at ¶¶ 17, 18.) During the relevant time frame, due to the economic recession, there were no lateral or lower level positions available in the San Francisco Bay area. (Id. at ¶ 26.) Furthermore, even if there had been such open positions, it is unlikely that Plaintiff, given that she had only been employed by FedEx for four months before becoming disabled, would have qualified for placement preference ahead of other, [*12]  longer-term, disabled employees on medical leave. (Id. at ¶ 27.)
On the record, the Court finds there is no dispute of fact tending to support Plaintiff's claim for failure to engage in interactive process.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant FedEx's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. A separate judgment shall issue. The Clerk shall close the file.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
