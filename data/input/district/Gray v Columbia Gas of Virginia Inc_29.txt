Opinion



ORDER
This matter is before the Court on Defendant Columbia Gas of Virginia, Inc.'s ("Defendant's" or "Columbia's") Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint ("Motion"). Doc. 20. The parties convened for a hearing on May 28, 2019. For the reasons stated herein and on the bench, the Court GRANTS Columbia's Motion WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. The Court ORDERS that the parties attend a settlement conference within two (2) weeks of the Court's hearing on this matter. Rayford M. Gray ("Plaintiff or "Gray") may file a second amended complaint within five (5) days of the settlement conference, and Columbia may file a response ten (10) days thereafter.

I. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS1
Gray began employment with Columbia on or around May 1984 as a Plant Laborer. Doc. 18 ("Am. [*2]  Compl.") ¶ 4. He later became a Service Tech. Id. For many years, Gray performed all of the essential functions of his job "efficiently, appropriately and adequately." Id. ¶ 6. He was discharged on April 4, 2015, after thirty-one (31) years, due to his inability to pass an examination implemented in 2015. Id.
After failing the test three (3) times, Gray voluntarily participated in a neuropsychological evaluation conducted by Dr. Melissa Hunter. Am. Compl. ¶ 3. Dr. Hunter's evaluation, attached to Gray's Amended Complaint, diagnosed Gray with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ("ADHD") and "other disabling conditions." Id. ¶ 8. Specifically, Dr. Hunter found that Gray's Full Scale Intelligence Quotient ("FSIQ") is approximately 65,2 consistent with a "developmental intellectual limitation." Id. at Ex. 1. She further stated that Gray has significant limitations in reading and comprehension, falling below the first percentile "compared to his peers," and "as a result of the aforementioned, he has difficulty acclimating to new technology." Id. Finally, Dr. Hunter noted that Gray experienced "cognitive problems following an acute medical event three years prior to the testing." Id. [*3]  She stated that he has a "moderate amount of white matter disease," and that vascular disease may have worsened Gray's developmental problems. Id.
Gray provided Dr. Hunter's diagnosis to Columbia, but he was not reinstated to his position. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3-4. Gray avers that his "various disabilities affect major life activities and prevented him from being able to pass the test that Columbia insisted he pass." Id. However, he was able to perform the duties described in the test and associated with his job at all relevant times. Id. ¶¶ 4, 6, 13.
Columbia attempted to accommodate Gray by having an individual read him the examination questions. Id. ¶ 5. However, "neither [the test administrator] nor anyone else would answer any questions that Gray asked about the [exam] questions and testing procedures." Id. Gray alleges that in administering the test, "Columbia created needless obstacles to prevent Gray from continuing his job functions . . . ." Id. ¶ 13. He further avers that Columbia "refused to engage in the interactive process to develop reasonable accommodations and refused to give serious consideration to any kinds of accommodation that would have allowed [him] to pass the test and/or [*4]  continue performing the work he had performed for many years." Id.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On or about September 18, 2015, Gray filed a Charge of Discrimination against Columbia with the EEOC, alleging violations of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended ("ADA"). Doc. 11 at 1-2. On May 25, 2017, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights stating that it had closed its file on Plaintiff's charge because it was unable to conclude that a violation of the ADA had occurred. Id. Gray filed a civil action against Defendant in the Suffolk Circuit Court on or about August 22, 2017. Id. at 2. Columbia removed the action to this Court on September 7, 2018. Doc. 1.
On September 14, 2018, Columbia filed a Motion to Dismiss. Doc. 5. Gray filed his Opposition on September 20, 2018, Doc. 9, and Columbia filed its Reply on September 26, 2018, Doc. 10.
Gray filed a Motion to Remand this action to state court on September 20, 2018. Doc. 7. Columbia filed its Opposition on October 4, 2018, Doc. 11, and Gray filed his Reply on October 9, 2018, Doc. 12. On January 14, 2019, the Court DENIED Plaintiff's Motion for Remand, Doc. 7, and GRANTED Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Doc. 5, with leave to amend. Doc. 15.
On January 16, 2019, [*5]  Columbia moved to continue this Court's Rule 16(b) scheduling conference, pending Plaintiff's filing of an amended complaint. Doc. 16. The Court DENIED that motion. Doc. 17.
On January 24, 2019, Gray filed his Amended Complaint. Doc. 18. Columbia filed the instant Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint on February 7, 2019. Doc. 20. Gray filed his Opposition on February 20, 2019, Doc. 22, and Columbia filed its Reply on February 26, 2019. Doc. 23.

III. LEGAL STANDARD
"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A reviewing court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Bowling v. Dir., Virginia Dep't of Corr., 920 F.3d 192, 196 (4th Cir. 2019). In "considering a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court's task is limited to deciding whether the plaintiff is entitled to offer evidence in support of his or her claims, not whether the plaintiff will eventually prevail." Davis v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 783 F. Supp. 2d 825, 830 (E.D. Va. 2011). Therefore, the court "does not resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses." McNair v. Spencer. No. 4:17CV38, 2018 WL 2147515, at *4 (E.D. Va. May 3, 2018) (citing Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 952 (4th Cir. 1992)). However, the court may consider documents attached to the complaint and those incorporated by reference without converting a [*6]  Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. See Pueschel v. United States, 369 F.3d 345, 353 n.3 (4th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).

IV. ANALYSIS
The ADA prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals because of a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Such unlawful discrimination can include discriminatory discharge, id., or failing to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee . . . .," id. § 12112(b)(5)(A). Gray alleges that Columbia discriminated against him by: (1) discharging him from his position, and (2) failing to accommodate his disability in the administration of the 2015 examination.

A. Disability Status
Columbia's Motion relies on the assertion that Gray does not have a disability within the meaning of the ADA. Doc. 21 at 4.

i. Actual Disability
The ADA defines "disability" to mean "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102. Such an impairment may include "[a]ny mental or psychological disorder, such as an intellectual disability (formerly termed 'mental retardation'), organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2. According to the Supreme [*7]  Court, individuals with an Intelligence Quotient ("IQ") of seventy-five (75) or lower may generally be found to have an "intellectual disability." Hall v. Fla., 572 U.S. 701, 714, 134 S. Ct. 1986, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (2014); see also, Atkins v. Virginia. 536 U.S. 304, 308 n.5, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002) (observing that "between 1 and 3 percent of the population has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition"). The American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities defines an "intellectual disability" as a "disability characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior," generally characterized by an IQ test score below seventy-five (75). American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, Definition of Intellectual Disability. (May 13, 2019, 11:31 AM), http://aaidd.org/intellectual-disability/definition.3
Columbia challenges Gray's diagnosis of ADHD and his illiteracy as inadequate bases for disability status under the ADA. See Doc. 21 at 5. However, Dr. Hunter's diagnosis, incorporated into Gray's Amended Complaint, finds Gray's FSIQ to be approximately sixty-five (65). If the Court accepts Dr. Hunter's diagnosis as true, Gray's IQ [*8]  is consistent with an intellectual disability. Am. Compl. at Ex. 1.
Columbia next argues that, even if Gray does have a disability, he has not alleged that it "substantially limits" any major life activity. Under the ADA, "major life activities" include, inter alia, "learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." Class v. Towson Univ., 806 F.3d 236, 244 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A)); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2; Gonzales v. Nat'l Bd. of Med. Examiners, 225 F.3d 620, 626 (6th Cir. 2000) ("[C]ourts have included reading and writing as major life activities under the ADA."); Bercovitch v. Baldwin Sen., Inc., 133 F.3d 141,155 (1st Cir. 1998) (finding learning to be a major life activity); Rodriguez v. Vill. Green Realty. Inc., 788 F.3d 31,48 (2d Cir. 2015) (reading); Emory v. AstraZeneca Pharm. LP, 401 F.3d 174,181-82 (3d Cir. 2005) (reading and processing information); Sanchez v. United States Dep't of Energy, 870 F.3d 1185, 1199 (10th Cir. 2017) (reading).
Dr. Hunter's assessment concludes that, in the context of Grays' intellectual disability, Gray has significant limitations in reading and comprehension. Am. Compl. ¶13. That Dr. Hunter found Gray to be in the first percentile for reading and comprehension supports an inference that he is substantially limited in these activities. Cf. Betts v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 18 Fed. App'x 114, 118 (4th Cir. 2001) (stating that "substantially limits" means a disability restricts a plaintiff's abilities "in comparison to the general population") (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(C)). However, the Amended Complaint lacks an explicit allegation that Gray's intellectual disability has substantially limited him in the major life activities [*9]  of reading or learning. This provides an independent basis for the Court to GRANT Columbia's Motion.
Notably, Columbia also argues that Gray's allegation that his "various disabilities affect major life activities" does not satisfy the "substantial limitation" standard. Doc. 21 at 6 (emphasis added). However, the Federal Rules "do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted." Johnson v. City of Shelby. Miss., 574 U.S. 10, 135 S. Ct. 346, 346, 190 L. Ed. 2d 309 (2014). Nevertheless, Gray's second amended complaint should remedy this deficiency.
In sum, the Court FINDS that Gray has not sufficiently pleaded he suffered from a disability. If he seeks to amend his Complaint, he must: (1) specifically allege the nature of his disability; (2) allege the connection, if any, between his disability and his inability to perform a major life activity; and (3) allege the extent to which he is "substantially limited" in major life activities.

ii. Perceived Disability
Under the ADA, a disability may also take the following forms: (1) a "record of an impairment; or (3) "being regarded as" having such an impairment. Summers v. Altarum Inst., Corp., 740 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)). To the extent Gray wishes to invoke these prongs of the ADA, he must clearly allege a timeline [*10]  of events that allows the Court to infer that Columbia was aware of his disability prior to any adverse employment action.

B. Discriminatory Discharge
Even if Plaintiff had established that he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA, he has failed to sufficiently allege several remaining aspects of his ADA claims. To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge under the ADA, a plaintiff must allege: "(1) he was subject to an adverse employment action; (2) he was a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA; (3) his performance at the time of the discharge met the legitimate expectations of his employer; and (4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination." Pickering v. Va. State Police, 59 F. Supp. 3d 742, 748 (E.D. Va. 2014).
Gray has alleged that he was subject to an adverse employment action through his removal from his position at Columbia.4 Am. Compl. ¶ 4. He also alleges that he was a "qualified individual" who met the legitimate expectations of his employer at the time of his discharge. Id. ¶¶ 4, 6, 13; see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) (defining "qualified individual" as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of [*11]  the employment position that such individual holds or desires"). However, Gray fails to satisfy the final requirement: that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.
The facts in the Amended Complaint portray a company that did not object to Gray's disability. Gray alleges that he worked for Columbia for thirty-one (31) years prior to his discharge, seemingly without incident. Am. Compl. ¶ 6. Columbia attempted to assist him in his examination by having someone read the test aloud to him, and it permitted Gray to take the examination three (3) times. Id. ¶¶ 4-5. Importantly, Gray's Amended Complaint fails to allege typical indicia of discriminatory intent, such as comments about his disability, a temporal relationship between his diagnosis and termination, or disparate treatment. E.E.O.C. v. Town & Country Toyota. Inc., 7 F. App'x 226, 232 (4th Cir. 2001) (finding comments made by a plaintiff's employer about his disability during his termination to be indicative of discriminatory intent); Pickering, 59 F. Supp. 3d at 746 (finding discriminatory intent where an employee was terminated six weeks after his employer learned of his disability); Corbett v. Richmond Metro. Transp. Auth., 203 F. Supp. 3d 699, 706 (E.D. Va. 2016) (finding discriminatory intent where an employer failed to offer specific [*12]  reasons for discharge and treated the plaintiff more harshly than other employees); White v. Va. Bd. for People with Disabilities. No. 3:18-CV-360-JAG, 2019 WL 413546, at *3 (E.D. Va. Feb. 1, 2019) (finding a plaintiff alleged discriminatory intent where a less-qualified employee without a disability received a promotion over the plaintiff).5
Gray avers that Columbia created "needless obstacles to prevent Gray from continuing his job functions . . . ." Am. Compl. ¶ 13. However, this conclusory assertion, without supporting factual allegations, does not give rise to an inference of discriminatory intent. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Columbia's with respect to Gray's allegation of discriminatory discharge. Plaintiff must plead discriminatory intent to remedy this deficiency in his second amended complaint.

C. Failure to Accommodate
Gray next alleges that Columbia failed to accommodate his disability in the administration of the 2015 examination that led to his discharge.6 To establish a failure to accommodate claim, a plaintiff must allege: "(1) that he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the employer had notice of his disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the position ...; and (4) that the employer [*13]  refused to make such accommodations." Rhoads v. FDIC, 257 F.3d 373, 387 n.20 (4th Cir. 2001). "Implicit in the fourth element is the ADA requirement that the employer and employee engage in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation." Williamson v. Bon Secours Richmond Health Svs., Inc., 34 F. Supp. 3d 607, 612 n.3 (4th Cir. 2014). This requirement "is triggered when an employee communicates her disability and desire for an accommodation—even if the employee fails to identify a specific, reasonable accommodation." Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 581 (4th Cir. 2015). However, an employee "cannot base a reasonable accommodation claim solely on the allegation that the employer failed to engage in an interactive process." Walter v. United Airlines. Inc., 232 F.3d 892 (4th Cir. 2000) (table decision) (internal citations omitted). Instead, the employee must allege that the employer's failure to engage in such a process resulted in a failure to identify an appropriate accommodation. Id.
ADA regulations offer additional guidance about workplace examinations. The regulations provide:
The intent of this provision is to further emphasize that individuals with disabilities are not to be excluded from jobs that they can actually perform merely because a disability prevents them from taking a test, or negatively influences the results of a test, that is a prerequisite to the job.
29 C.F.R. § Pt. 1630, App. The regulations further state that a test should be administered in an alternative format to reasonably accommodate a disability. Id. However, "[w]here it is not possible to test in an alternative format, the employer may be required, as a reasonable accommodation, to evaluate the skill to be tested in another manner (e.g., through an interview, or through education license, or work experience requirements)." Id.
Here, Gray alleges that he was able to fully perform all the duties required by his long-time position at Columbia, but that Columbia's newly-implemented examination prevented him from maintaining his position. Am. Compl. 14. He further alleges that he could perform the skills that the [*15]  examination tested, but he could not pass the examination itself due to his intellectual disability. Id. ¶ 13. Finally, he claims that Columbia would not answer his questions during the exam, id. ¶ 5, did not reinstate him after being notified of his disability, ¶ 4, and would not engage in an interactive process to develop reasonable accommodations for him to maintain his position, id. ¶ 13. While Gray's allegations support the essence of a failure to accommodate claim, he fails to allege that he ever requested an accommodation.
The ADA does not require an employer to "guess or read the employee's mind," Shiflett v. GE Fame Automation Corp, 151 F.3d 1030, 1998 WL 386116, at *8-9 (4th Cir. 1998). The circumstances suggest that Columbia was aware of Gray's limitations and need for an accommodation. However, Gray has failed to allege that he ever requested an accommodation. Without this essential element, the Court must GRANT Columbia's Motion to Dismiss with respect to Gray's failure to accommodate claim.

V. LEAVE TO AMEND
Leave to amend "shall be freely given when justice so requires." Francisco v. Doherty. Sheridan & Grimaldi, L.L.P., 178 F.3d 1283 (4th Cir. 1999) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2)). It should be denied "only when the amendment would be prejudicial to the opposing party, there has been bad faith on the part of the moving party, or the amendment would be futile." [*16]  Balas v. Huntington Ingalls Indus., Inc., 711 F.3d 401, 409 (4th Cir, 2013).
Here, there does not appear to have been bad faith, nor does it appear that amendment would be futile. Moreover, any prejudice caused by permitting Gray to file a second amended complaint is outweighed by the injustice that would occur if Gray's case were dismissed due to legal formalities. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Gray leave to amend his complaint within five (5) days of the parlies' settlement conference. Columbia shall have ten (10) days to respond thereafter.

VI. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated herein, the Court GRANTS Columbia's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint, Doc. 20, WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. The Court ORDERS that the parties attend a settlement conference within two (2) weeks of the Court's hearing on this matter. Gray may file a second amended complaint within five (5) days of the settlement conference, and Columbia shall have ten (10) days to respond thereafter.
The Clerk is REQUESTED to deliver electronically a copy of this Order to all counsel of record.
It is so ORDERED.
