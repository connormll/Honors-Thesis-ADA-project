Opinion



OPINION AND ORDER
Vivian Hawkins is an employee of the Arkansas Department of Human Services. After two years on the job, as a result of promotions, she and Zofia Higginbotham ended up working in adjoining cubicles beginning in May of 2012. In December, Hawkins experienced an allergic reaction to a poinsettia placed on Higginbotham's desk. Over the next six months, Hawkins complained that she suffered from a scent sensitivity, which Higginbotham aggravated by using scented perfumes, candles, lotions, and potpourri. Hawkins [*2]  missed work due to her scent sensitivity. Eventually, she was terminated, but she filed an administrative appeal and was later reinstated.
Hawkins commenced this action on September 9, 2014, asserting the following claims: failure to accommodate and retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for failure to provide due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; retaliation in violation of the Family Medical Leave Act; outrage; and battery.1 The defendants include Hawkins's employer, DHS;2 superiors, Cindy Gillespie,3 Brenda Jackson, Steven Petersen, and Kevin Stacker; and co-worker Zofia Higginbotham. Except Higginbotham, who is only sued in her individual capacity, the defendants are sued in their official and individual capacities. The defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Document #27. For the following reasons, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.

I.
A court should grant summary judgment if the evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of [*3]  law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute for trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the moving party meets that burden, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts that establish a genuine dispute of material fact. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031, 1042 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc). A genuine dispute of material fact exists only if the evidence is sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and must give that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record. Pedersen v. Bio-Med. Applications of Minn., 775 F.3d 1049, 1053 (8th Cir. 2015). If the nonmoving party fails to present evidence sufficient to establish an essential element of a claim on which that party bears the burden of proof, then the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.

II.
The following facts are undisputed. DHS hired Hawkins on May 10, 2010. DHS promoted Hawkins on March 12, 2012. Document #29-6. Hawkins then moved to cubicle 4132 in order to be closer to others performing the same job duties. In May, DHS promoted Higginbotham and she moved to the cubicle adjacent to Hawkins, cubicle 4133. Prior to Hawkins's promotion, she [*4]  and Higginbotham worked on the same floor but not in adjacent cubicles. Sometime during the fall of 2012, their relationship began to change. Hawkins complained to Steven Petersen—the agency controller at the time—about Higginbotham. The subject of the complaint is unclear, but it was unrelated to the scent sensitivity. Higginbotham stopped speaking to Hawkins.
In December, Higginbotham placed a poinsettia on her desk, which caused Hawkins to experience sneezing and watery eyes. Hawkins eventually complained and the poinsettia was removed from the desk. After the poinsettia incident, Hawkins started documenting her issues with Higginbotham on a calendar. The first recorded exposure to perfume and spray is January 22, 2013. Document #29-8 at 1 ("Exposed to perfume sprayed all day + lotion"). Hawkins's time sheet shows that she did not miss any work on that day. Document #29-9 at 1. This pattern continued through January 24 and then again from January 28 through February 1. Document #29-8 at 1, 2.
On February 2, Hawkins checked into the Arkansas Heart Hospital, presenting with chest pains. Document #29-7 at 9. Several months prior, in July, she had a coronary stenting. Id. Hawkins was [*5]  discharged from the hospital on February 7 and permitted to return to work on the thirteenth. Id. at 11. Hawkins returned to the Arkansas Heart Hospital for a follow-up appointment on March 5. Document #29-7 at 1. The hospital record reflects that Hawkins's eyes were normal and that her ears, nose, and throat were clear. Id. Hawkins's personal calendar indicates she suffered from swollen eyes, migraines, and breathing issues from March 6 through March 8; she missed no work on those days. Document #29-8 at 3; Document #29-9 at 10. She recorded on March 18 that there was a potpourri bag on a fan. Document #29-8 at 3. Then, on April 5 she recorded that she suffered from a migraine, stress, and breathing issues, and on April 8 she recorded that she was "[e]xposed to perfume or something sprayed in cubicles." Id. at 4. On neither day did she miss work. Document #29-9 at 14, 17.
Hawkins saw her primary care physician, Dr. Gennice Perry, on April 11. Document #29-10. Dr. Perry provided Hawkins a doctor's note, in which she opined that Hawkins's symptoms could be caused by exposure to strong fragrances and suggested a change in work place location. Id. Hawkins missed work the day of the appointment and the [*6]  following day, using accrued leave-time. On April 16, Hawkins changed work places, moving one cubicle away from Higginbotham and cubicle 4312 to cubicle 4147. Document #29-11. Hawkins returned to Dr. Perry on April 18; Dr. Perry referred Hawkins to an allergist, Dr. Anil Badhwar. Document #29-10 at 3. Dr. Perry's reason for the referral was "[a]llergic reaction possible cologne unknown trigger." Id. Hawkins missed work on April 18 and 19 because she was in the hospital. Document #29-9 at 22. Petersen submitted a request to Jackson for 24 hours of leave without pay, which Jackson approved. Id.
Dr. Badhwar saw Hawkins for the first time on April 20. Document #29-12 at 1. He reported that her chief complaint was a rash on the face, arms, and neck, an inability to breathe, coughing, and wheezing. Id. He also reported that Hawkins identified these symptoms as an allergic reaction to another woman's perfume and stated that she has had a sensitivity to perfumes for more than twenty years. Id. Dr. Badhwar concluded that Hawkins suffered from contact dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, non-allergic rhinitis, and dyspnea. Id. at 3. He performed allergy testing, but was unable to pinpoint the specific [*7]  substance to which Hawkins was allergic. Id. He prescribed a nasal spray and suggested she avoid scented materials. Id. at 6.
Dr. Badhwar completed ADA and FMLA documentation for Hawkins on May 18. Document #29-14. He stated that Hawkins develops headaches and has trouble concentrating on her work when she is exposed to perfumes. Id. at 1. He recommended that in order to accommodate Hawkins's non-allergic rhinitis, the other employees should stop wearing perfume and using air fresheners and scented candles. Id. He also recommended that Hawkins be moved 150 feet from employees using air freshener or perfume. Id. Dr. Badhwar characterized Hawkins's condition as "lifelong" and recorded that the approximate date the condition commenced was December 15, 2012. Id. at 2, 4.
Hawkins submitted an FMLA leave request for April 20, 2013, April 27, 2013, April 30, 2013, and May 18, 2013. That request was approved. Document #29-13.
Hawkins submitted the ADA and FMLA documentation on May 20, 2015. Jackson, Petersen, and Kevin Stacker met with Hawkins on May 21, 2013 to discuss the best way to accommodate Hawkins's scent sensitivity. Document #29-15 at 1. Hawkins wanted to move to a different cubicle, but the defendants maintained [*8]  there was not a cubicle that conformed to the doctor's specifications. Id. DHS ultimately offered to purchase a standard air purifier and to allow Hawkins to continue to use fans. Id. at 2. DHS also told Hawkins she was expected to obtain masks. Id. Hawkins agreed to accept the air purifier and continue to use the fans, but refused to obtain masks. Id. On May 29, 2013, "non-allergic rhinitis" was approved as a qualified condition under the FMLA by DHS human resources compliance officer Lynne Bowen. Document #29-16. Hawkins was permitted to take intermittent leave for episodic flare-ups. Id.
The next incident relating to the non-allergic rhinitis took place on June 20. Document #29-5 at 11. Hawkins claims she was exposed to 409 cleaner. Id. Two days after the exposure, Hawkins went to see Dr. Badhwar. Document #29-12 at 8. Dr. Badhwar recorded that Hawkins's chief complaints were: "workers comp paperwork, migraine x 3 days." Id. Dr. Badhwar provided Hawkins a note to take to work: "Ms. Hawkins may go back to work on 6/24/13 only if she is provided with [sic] work place which is perfume, scent free." Document #29-12 at 13.
Hawkins returned to work on June 24 and attempted to submit the workers [*9]  compensation documentation and Dr. Badhwar's note to Stacker. Document #29-5 at 12. Stacker refused to accept the documents and contacted Petersen. Document #29-4 at 11. When Petersen arrived, he asked Hawkins to remain downstairs until Jackson arrived. Id. The parties dispute the exchange that took place between Hawkins and Jackson, once she arrived. What is undisputed is that Hawkins was at some point handed a letter of termination. Document #29-18 at 1. Hawkins left the premises, but was called later and told that she was not terminated; rather, she was being placed on administrative leave. Document #29-5 at 16. Pending on June 24 was an appeal Hawkins had submitted regarding the ADA accommodations. Document #37-9 at 16.
Hawkins returned to work on July 1, when the administrative leave expired. Document #37-10 at 5. The parties dispute what happened once Hawkins arrived at work, but it is undisputed that Hawkins was terminated again. Document #29-8 at 2. Then, she filed a grievance regarding her termination. Document #37-20. On July 8, Hawkins submitted a Charge of Discrimination to the EEOC, claiming discrimination based on disability. Document #29-20. On July 9, Civil Rights/Employee [*10]  Relations Coordinator Antoinette Mitchelle found that DHS provided reasonable accommodations to Hawkins. Document #37-10 at 9 ("I find that the agency by providing Ms. Hawkins with a commercial air filter met her medical needs."). On August 10, Dr. Badhwar amended his accommodation recommendation. Document #29-12 at 14. He changed "150 feet" scent-free radius to "30 feet" scent-free radius. Id. He abandoned his assertion that Hawkins be provided scent-free work-place. Id. On May 27, 2014, DHS conducted a three-day fact-finding conference to resolve the grievance filed on July 1. Document #37-20 at 1. The deciding official overturned DHS's decision to terminate Hawkins, ordered reinstatement, and placed her on paid administrative leave until the parties could complete the interactive ADA process in accordance with DHS policy. Id. at 23. The deciding official denied Hawkins's requests for different work supervisors, back pay, attorney fees, and medical expenses. Id.
Hawkins returned to work at DHS on June 11, 2014. She received a right to sue letter from the EEOC on July 14. Then, she commenced this action on September 9.

III.
Hawkins alleges discrimination and retaliation under the ADA and section 504 of [*11]  the Rehabilitation Act. "[D]ecisions interpreting either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act are applicable and 'interchangeable' to claims under each statute." Hill v. Walker, 737 F.3d 1209, 1216 (8th Cir. 2013). Title I of the ADA prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. 12112(a). Likewise, section 504 prohibits discrimination against an "otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . solely by reason of her or his disability." 29 U.S.C. § 794.

A. Individual Liability
The defendants argue that there is no individual liability under either Title I of the ADA or section 504, so Hawkins's claims for disability discrimination and retaliation fail against the state official defendants in their individual capacities.4 Document #28 at 18. Hawkins failed to contest the defendants' individual liability argument in her response to the defendants' motion. See Document #37. The Eighth Circuit has not ruled on whether individual liability exists under Title I of the ADA, but it has held that there is no individual liability under Title II. See Adefris v. Wilson Trailer Co., No. C15-4063-MWB, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3341, 2016 WL 141762 at *7 (N.D. Iowa, Jan. 12, 2016) (citing Alsbrook v. City of Maumelle, 184 F.3d 999, 1005 n. 8 (8th Cir. 1999)). In Alsbrook, the court held that Title II does not provide for individual liability and bolstered its holding through comparison to decisions by [*12]  other courts considering individual liability under Title I: "Furthermore, while no circuit has directly addressed the issue of individual liability under Title II, three have held there is no liability under Title I against individuals who do no otherwise qualify as 'employers' under the statutory definition." Alsbrook, 184 F.3d at 1005 n.8 (citing Butler v. City of Prairie Vill., 172 F.3d 736, 744 (10th Cir. 1999); Mason v. Stallings, 82 F.3d 1007, 1009 (11th Cir. 1996); EEOC v. AIC Sec. Investigations, Ltd., 55 F.3d 1276, 1280-82 (7th Cir. 1995)). See also Roman-Oliveras v. Puerto Rico Elec. Power Auth., 655 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 2011) (concluding that Title I of the ADA does not provide for liability against individuals who are not themselves employers and characterizing this conclusion as "virtually universal"). In the absence of any argument or authority to the contrary and in the presence of Eighth Circuit precedent indicating that no individual liability arises under Title I under the ADA, Hawkins's claims against the state officials in their individual capacities will be dismissed.
Neither has the Eighth Circuit ruled on the existence of individual liability under section 504, but the act prohibits discrimination in any "program or activity" receiving federal funds. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Section 794(b) defines "program or activity" as, among other things, "a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government . . ." Title IX contains almost identical language and the [*13]  Eighth Circuit has held that there is no individual liability under that act. See Kinman v. Omaha Pub. Sch. Dist., 171 F.3d 607, 611 (8th Cir. 1999). See also Davis v. Flexman, 109 F. Supp. 2d 776, 794-95 (S.D. Ohio 1999) (collecting cases). Therefore, in the absence of any argument or persuasive authority to the contrary, the Court holds that Hawkins's claims under the Rehabilitation Act against the state officials in their individual capacities also fail as a matter of law.5

B. Discrimination
Hawkins's claim for discrimination is based on a failure to accommodate theory. Document #1 at 28, ¶ 90. "Discrimination" includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "To support her failure to accommodate claim, Hawkins 'must establish both a prima facie case of discrimination based on her disability and a failure to accommodate it.'" Kelleher v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 817 F.3d 624, 631 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Schaffhauser v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 794 F.3d 899, 905 (8th Cir. 2015)). To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, Hawkins must show that (1) she is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA; (2) she was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (3) she suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Minnihan v. Mediacom Commc'ns Corp., 779 F.3d 803, 810 (8th Cir. 2015). Once she makes this showing, the burden shifts to [*14]  DHS to show that it is unable to accommodate her. Peebles v. Potter, 354 F.3d 761, 767 (8th Cir. 2004) ("Reasonable accommodation claims are not evaluated under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis. Rather, a 'modified burden-shifting analysis' is applied.").
The defendants argue that Hawkins is not a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA. The ADA provides three definitions for "disability": (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (2) a record of such an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Congress amended the ADA in 2008 with the explicit purpose of rejecting the strict standard applied by the courts in evaluating what constitutes a disability. See Rhodes v. Langston Univ., 462 Fed. Appx. 773, 776, 2011 WL 4867552 at **3 (10th Cir. 2011) (citing ADA Amendments Act of 2008, 154 Cong. Rec. H8286-03, 110th Cong. (2008)). Prior to the 2008 amendments, the courts construed "disability" narrowly and focused on whether the plaintiff was disabled. See Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002) (overturned due to legislative action in ADAA, Pub.L. No. 110-325, § 2(b)(4), 122 Stat. 3553, 3554 (2008). Since the amendments, the courts have construed "disability" more broadly and focused on the employer's compliance with the ADA. See Oehmke v. Medtronic, Inc., 844 F.3d 748, 756 (8th Cir. 2016); Rotkowski v. Ark. Rehab. Servs., 180 F. Supp. 3d 618, 623 (W.D. Ark. 2016); Floyd v. Lee, 85 F. Supp. 3d 482, 499 (D.C. 2015); Chancey v. Fairfield So. Co., Inc., 949 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1184 (N.D. Ala. 2013); Nichols v. City of Mitchell, 914 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1058 (D. S.D. 2012). "[C]ourts have consistently found fragrance sensitivity to be a disability." [*15]  Rotkowski, 180 F. Supp. 3d at 623 (citing Brady v. United Refrigeration, Inc., No. 13-6008, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72156, 2015 WL 3500125 at *11 (E.D. Penn. June 3, 2015); Bouard v. Ramtron Int'l Corp., No. 12-cv-00494-WYD-MJW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140649, 2013 WL 5445846 at *8 (D. Colo. Sept. 27, 2013)).
However, while the ADAA "makes it easier to prove a disability, it does not absolve a party from proving one." Neely v. PSEG Tex., Ltd. P'ship, 735 F.3d 242, 245 (5th Cir. 2013). "[N]ot every impairment will constitute a disability [under the ADAA]." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hawkins, she has shown that her scent sensitivity substantially limits her ability to perform major life activities, such as working, breathing and thinking. See Rotkowski, 180 F. Supp. 3d at 624. See also 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). Hawkins sought medical attention from her primary care provider, Dr. Perry, complaining of dizziness and shortness of breath. Document #29-10 at 1. Dr. Perry stated: "Her pulmonary function testing is consistent with restriction of the airways . . . my medical opinion [sic] that this could be caused by exposure to strong fragrances." Id. Dr. Perry referred Hawkins to a specialist, Dr. Badhwar, who diagnosed Hawkins with "non-allergic rhinitis." Document #29-12 at 3. Hawkins complained to Dr. Badhwar of coughing, weezing, a rash, and the inability to breathe. Document #29-12 at 1. Hawkins also complained that she frequently developed headaches and had trouble concentrating on her work when she was exposed to perfumes. [*16]  Document #29-14 at 1. Dr. Badhwar thought enough of Hawkins's complaints to recommend to DHS that Hawkins be moved away from other employees wearing perfume or to prohibit other employees from wearing perfume. Id. Further, a co-worker of Hawkins, Jan Edwards, swore under oath that on one occasion Hawkins became so sick because of scent exposure that her eyes were swollen, her skin was welted and red, and she could not breath. Document #37-3 at 2, ¶ 8. Edwards worried that Hawkins would not able to drive home. Id.
"The term 'qualified individual' means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Hawkins has submitted evidence tending to show that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job. Document #37-6 at 6-7; Document #37-15. Therefore, she is a "qualified individual" within the meaning of the ADA and Section 504 for the purposes of summary judgment.
The defendants argue that Hawkins has failed to show she was terminated because of her disability. The issue is whether the record supports the conclusion that Hawkins's need for accommodations motivated the DHS [*17]  officials' decision to terminate her. Oehmke, 844 F.3d at 756-57 (applying a mixed-motive causation standard and declining to address whether a "but-for" standard, rather than a "mixed-motive" standard, applied to ADA claims because the defendant only "cursorily briefed" the issue). Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Hawkins, evidence supports the conclusion that her need for accommodations precipitated her termination.
The parties dispute what happened on June 24 and July 1, the dates on which Hawkins was terminated. Stacker says that on the 24th, Hawkins reported to work and demanded a scent-free environment. Document #29-4 at 11. Stacker told Hawkins that he was not authorized to do so. Id. Jackson arrived later and says that directed Hawkins to report to work several times, but Hawkins repeatedly refused. Document #29-1 at 19. Petersen says that Hawkins was terminated on the 24th "because she refused to report to her work station." Document #29-3 at 12. The termination letter states:
This letter is to confirm that your employment with the Arkansas Department of Human Services is terminated immediately effective June 24, 2013. This notification is provided to you in accordance with DHS policy [*18]  #1078.5.3 (Americans with Disabilities Act) due to your inability to perform the essential functions of your job after reasonable accommodations were made by the Department of Human Services.
Document #29-18 (emphasis added). Hawkins's account of the 24th diverges from her superiors beginning when Jackson arrived. Document #29-5 at 13. Hawkins maintains that Jackson asked if she could return to her cubicle and perform her job. Id. Hawkins responded: "Yes, I can perform my job. No, I cannot return to the workstation until the potpourri is removed." Id. When Jackson asked Hawkins if she was refusing to do her job, Hawkins said, no, she was refusing to "sit next to the potpourri." Id. Then, after waiting outside Jackson's office for a while, Hawkins was terminated. Id. at 16. DHS rescinded the termination later that day and placed her on administrative leave because an appeal of the provided accommodations was pending. Id. at 17.
Petersen and Jackson say that on July 1, Hawkins appeared for work but again refused to report to her work station because Higginbotham was up moving around. Document #29-1 at 23; Document #29-3 at 17. Jackson says that Hawkins came into her office, told her that she would not report [*19]  to her work station because Higginbotham was walking down the hall, and then got up and left the office. Document #29-1 at 23. Hawkins insists, however, that when she arrived at work she was taken to the fourth floor where she waited outside Jackson's office for forty-five minutes while Jackson, Stacker, and Petersen had a private meeting. Document #29-5 at 18. Then, according to Hawkins, she was called in and handed a second termination letter. Id. The second termination letter states:
This letter is to confirm that your employment with the Arkansas Department of Human Services is terminated immediately effective July 1, 2013 due to your continue refusal to work or to perform your work as required despite the accommodations that have been offered to you.
Document #29-19 (emphasis added). If a jury were to believe Hawkins's version of her termination, it could find that the need for accommodations motivated the decision to terminate her employment. Even if a jury were to believe the defendants' version of what happened, the termination letters specifically refer to accommodations and a jury could reasonably conclude that Hawkins was fired because the DHS officials were tired of dealing [*20]  with her scent-sensitivity issues. In fact, Petersen recorded in a memo that Jackson and a DHS attorney met and "determined that reasonable accommodations had been made regarding Ms. Hawkins reported allergy issues and that no additional accommodations were possible and none could be made," so Hawkins was terminated. Document #29-23.
Hawkins has made a prima facie case of disability discrimination, but she must also establish a failure to accommodate her disability. See Schaffhauser, 794 F.3d at 906. "To determine whether an accommodation for an employee is necessary, and if so, what the accommodation might be, it is necessary for the employer and employee to engage in an 'interactive process.'" Peyton v. Fred's Stores of Ark., Inc., 561 F.3d 900, 902 (8th Cir. 2009). To show that an employer did not engage in an interactive process, the employee must prove:
1) the employer knew about the employee's disability;
2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability;
3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodation; and
4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith.
Schaffhauser, 794 F.3d at 906. "[T]he failure of an employer to engage in an interactive process to determine whether reasonable [*21]  accommodations are possible is prima facie evidence that the employer may be acting in bad faith." Cravens v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kan. City, 214 F.3d 1011, 1020 (8th Cir. 2000) (quoting Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 952 (8th Cir. 1999)). The defendants argue that they met with Hawkins on several occasions and provided accommodations after she requested them and that "Hawkins has not and cannot show that she could have been accommodated but for DHS's lack of good faith because there simply was not a way to guarantee Hawkins the scent-free environment she was demanding, per her physician's recommendations." Document #28 at 26.6
The interactive process is not the issue in this case; this case boils down to whether the accommodations DHS offered to Hawkins were "reasonable" and whether a reasonable accommodation that did not impose an undue burden was available. "An employer is not required to provide the specific accommodation requested or preferred by an employee." Scruggs v. Pulaski Co., Ark., 817 F.3d 1087, 1093 (8th Cir. 2016) (citing Cravens, 214 F.3d at 1019). Rather, an employer only has to provide an accommodation that is reasonable." Id. The ADA provides that a "reasonable accommodation" may include—
making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a [*22]  vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(9).
In Buckles v. First Data Res., Inc., 176 F.3d 1098 (8th Cir. 1999), the plaintiff/employee, Douglas J. Buckles, suffered from acute recurrent rhinosinusitis. Heavy perfumes, smoke, nail polish, glue, tar, and various adhesives triggered sinus attacks. Id. at 1099-00. The Eighth Circuit described the employer's accommodations: "First Data issued a memorandum to employees prohibiting use of nail polish in Buckles' department. First Data also moved Buckles from the department he was in and created a work station in another room with better ventilation. Finally, a system was arranged for Buckles whereby if he was sensing an irritant could sign off his phone, notify his supervisor, and wait until the problem was remedied." Id. at 1101. Buckles argued that these accommodations were unreasonable because they did not permit him to avoid irritants in the workplace. Id. The court disagreed: "In this situation, there is only so much avoidance that can be done before an employer would essentially be providing [*23]  a bubble for an employee to work in." Id. The court held that the accommodations were reasonable because they sought to avoid exposure and gave Buckles the opportunity to "exit the area" if he perceived exposure. See id.
To accommodate Hawkins's non-allergic rhinitis, DHS agreed to purchase a standard air purifier for use in Hawkins's cubicle, allowed her to continue to use the fans currently in her cubicle, and asked Hawkins to use masks. Document #37-19. Hawkins argues that these accommodations were unreasonable because they did not permit her to avoid irritants in the workplace. See Document #37 at 22. In her formal request for reasonable accommodation, Hawkins asked DHS to move her away from the source of the irritants. Document #37-16 at 2 ("I can be moved to back of room where I am not so exposed to everyone and the smells."). Lynne Bowen, DHS Personnel Compliance Officer, agreed and recommended a move to an area where exposure to candles, air fresheners, and potpourri was limited. Document #37-8. Bowen also stated that "prohibiting the use of such items in the work environment" and providing an air purifiers were options. Id. According to Jackson, however, Bowen called her "hollering [*24]  on the phone" and demanded that DHS tell its employees to stop wearing any scent. Document #37-5 at 13.
The defendants focus on Dr. Badhwar's recommendations that Hawkins be accommodated through the provision of a "scent-free" environment and by moving her work space 150 feet from any irritants. Document #28 at 26; Document #29-1 at 12 ("[W]e could not have accommodated her with a scent-free environment."). The defendants say that there were no "scent-free" areas and that if they moved her 150 feet she would be on the street. Document #28 at 13. It is up to a jury whether to take Dr. Badhwar's distance recommendations literally, or to interpret them simply as a request to move Hawkins to an area of the office away from Higginbotham. Furthermore, focusing exclusively on Dr. Badhwar's notes ignores Hawkins's prior request to switch cubicles. Hawkins says and Stacker corroborates that Petersen moved her to cubicle 4122 sometime during the winter of 2012-13 and while she was there, she did not have any migraines or other issues related to her condition. Document #37-1 at 3-4; Document #37-6 at 22. Jackson, however, required her to move back to her old cubicle. Id. A jury could reasonably [*25]  find that DHS officials, like the employer in Buckles, could have moved Hawkins to an empty cubicle. There is some dispute in the record as to the availability of empty cubicles and as to the need for Hawkins to be near others doing the same work, but the resolution of such disputes is a question for the jury.
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hawkins and giving her the benefit of all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record, her ADA and Section 504 claims for failure to accommodate survive the defendants' motion for summary judgment.

C. Retaliation
The defendants argue that Hawkins is barred in this action from asserting a claim for retaliation under the ADA and Section 504 because she failed to assert such a claim in her EEOC charge. Document #28 at 26. Under the ADA and Section 504, before filing a lawsuit in federal court, aggrieved individuals must (1) timely file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC setting forth the facts and nature of the charge and (2) receive notice of the right to sue. See Ballard v. Rubin, 284 F.3d 957, 964, n. 6 (8th Cir. 2002) (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act); Randolph v. Rodgers, 253 F.3d 342, 347 n. 8 (8th Cir. 2001) (ADA). Hawkins did not check the box for "retaliation" on her EEOC charge. Document #29-20. However, even if a claim is not listed in the EEOC charge, [*26]  a plaintiff is deemed to have exhausted her administrative remedies and may seek relief in some situations if the "discrimination . . . is like or reasonably related to the substance of the allegations in the administrative charge." Dorsey v. Pinnacle Automation Co., 278 F.3d 830, 838 (8th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation omitted). "[T]he question is whether the entire text of the charge, and not simply the boxes checked or the claims alleged therein, provides 'sufficient notice of [a] retaliation claim.'" Henke v. Allina Health Sys., 698 F. Supp. 2d 1115, 1124 (D. Minn. 2010); See also Graham v. Bryce Corp., 348 F. Supp. 2d 1038, 1042 (E.D. Ark. 2004) ("Nothing in the charge put the EEOC or [the defendant] on notice that she would later bring a claim for retaliation on any set of facts.").
Hawkins explained her allegations in the text of the charge:
On or about 05/10/2010, I was hired with my most recent position as an Accounts Analyst. Starting on or about 12/18/2012, I made several requests for a reasonable accommodation for my disability. On or about 6/24/2013, I was discharged, reinstated and placed on administrative leave. On or about 07/01/2013, I was discharged.
On 06/24/2013, I was informed I was discharged due to my inability to perform the essential functions of my job after reasonable accommodations were made. I was later informed I was not discharged and placed on administrative [*27]  leave pending recommendations from the ADA Coordinator. 07/01/2013, I was informed I was discharged due to my continued refusal to work or to perform my work as required despite the accommodations that I was offered.
I believe I was denied my requests for a reasonable accommodation and discharged because of my disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended.
Document #29-20. The charge must be construed with liberality in light of ADA's remedial purpose. Donnelly v. St. John's Mercy Med. Ctr., 635 F. Supp. 2d 970, 998 (E.D. Mo. 2009). Hawkins was not required to state explicitly that her requests for accommodation were the but for cause of her termination. "[W]hen the EEOC charge alleges facts from which a reader can infer a link between protected activity—for example, a complaint about perceived discriminatory treatment—and a subsequent adverse employment action, a retaliation claim asserted in a subsequent lawsuit will be 'reasonably related' to the EEOC charge." Morris v. David Lerner Assocs., 680 F. Supp. 2d 430, 438 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (collecting cases).
Hawkins's charge provided the EEOC and the defendants with sufficient notice of an ADA and Section 504 retaliation claim. The charge alludes to the elements of such a claim—engaging in a protected activity by requesting accommodations and suffering an adverse [*28]  employment action as a result. The claim for retaliation is not "outside the scope" of the initial EEOC charge; therefore, allowing such a claim to proceed would not circumvent the EEOC's investigative and conciliatory process. Duncan v. Delta Consol. Indus., Inc., 371 F.3d 1020, 1025 (8th Cir. 2004), abrogated on other grounds by Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031 (8th Cir. 2011). The defendants had sufficient notice of the retaliation claim.
To prevail on a claim for unlawful retaliation in violation of the ADA, Hawkins must show that she (1) engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) DHS officials took an adverse action against her, and (3) there was a causal connection between the adverse action and the protected activity. Hill, 737 F.3d at 1218. "The [Eighth Circuit] has held that a person who is terminated after unsuccessfully seeking an accommodation may pursue a retaliation claim under the ADA, if she had a good faith belief that the requested accommodation was appropriate." Id. (citing Heisler v. Metro Council, 339 F.3d 622, 632 (8th Cir. 2003)). Because there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether the accommodations provided by DHS officials were reasonable, Hawkins's retaliation claim survives. If a jury were to determine that DHS failed to provide reasonable accommodations and that reasonable accommodations that did not pose an undue burden were available, it could [*29]  reasonably find that Hawkins had a "good faith belief" that the accommodation she requested—moving to another cubicle—was appropriate.

IV.
Hawkins alleges a claim for retaliation in violation of the FMLA. "The FMLA prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee for asserting his rights under the Act." Stallings v. Hussmann Corp., 447 F.3d 1041, 1051 (8th Cir. 2006). "This prohibition necessarily includes consideration of an employee's use of FMLA leave as a negative factor in an employment action." Darby v. Bratch, 287 F.3d 673, 679 (8th Cir. 2002) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2)). "Basing an adverse employment action on an employee's use of leave . . . is therefore actionable." Smith v. Allen Health Sys., Inc., 302 F.3d 827, 832 (8th Cir. 2002).
An employer may not consider "an employee's use of FMLA leave as a negative factor in an employment action." Hite v. Vermeer Mfg. Co., 446 F.3d 858, 865 (8th Cir. 2006) (quoting Darby v. Bratch, 287 F.3d 673, 679 (8th Cir. 2002)). Because direct evidence can be difficult to come by, especially in the employment context, an employee can prove retaliation through circumstantial evidence using the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis. Smith v. Allen Health Sys., Inc., 302 F.3d 827, 832 (8th Cir. 2002). See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). To establish a prima facie action of retaliation, Hawkins must show (1) that she "engaged in protected conduct" by exercising her FMLA rights; (2) that she suffered a materially adverse employment action; and (3) that there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action. [*30]  Wierman v. Casey's Gen. Stores, 638 F.3d 984, 999 (8th Cir. 2011). If Hawkins makes this showing, the burden shifts to the defendants to present a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Hawkins's termination. Hite, 446 F.3d at 865. Once the defendants provide such a reason, the burden shifts back to Hawkins to demonstrate that the stated reason was merely a pretext for retaliation. Id.
The defendants argue that Hawkins has failed to provide any evidence tending to show that she was terminated because she requested to take FMLA leave or took too much FMLA leave. Document #28 at 29. Hawkins submitted a request for FMLA leave a few days before she was terminated. Document #29-9. DHS officials corresponded via e-mail about some confusion regarding how to code Hawkins's leave, since she was permitted to take intermittent leave for her qualifying condition—the scent sensitivity—but not all leave was for that condition. Document #37-9 at 2-5. Hawkins "believes" she was fired in part due to having to take so much FMLA leave. Document #37-1 at 6. Since Hawkins has been reinstated, she has job responsibilities that used to be shared by two people. Document #37-6 at 42. Hawkins says other employees are treated more leniently regarding tardiness. Document #1 at 8.
Hawkins has [*31]  failed to demonstrate a causal connection between her termination and her request for FMLA leave. The evidence in the record does not demonstrate a genuine dispute as to whether Hawkins was terminated for any reason relating to the FMLA. Her "belief" is insufficient and the e-mails simply show that DHS officials wanted to make sure they coded the leave correctly. See Document #37-9 at 2-5 There is no hint of frustration or reluctance to grant the requested leave. Id. As to the job responsibilities and tardiness, those issues arose after what Hawkins cites as the adverse employment action—her termination. Finally, a temporal connection is generally insufficient to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. See Sisk v. Picture People, Inc., 669 F.3d 896, 900-01 (8th Cir. 2012). The temporal connection here is weakened by the record, which shows that Hawkins took FMLA several times during the months leading up to her termination. No evidence tends to show that the last request suddenly precipitated a retaliatory action. The FMLA retaliation claim fails as a matter of law.

V.
Hawkins alleges a section 1983 claim for due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. She maintains that she was terminated twice without review, though a state employee is entitled to a hearing or some form of [*32]  due process before being deprived of a constitutionally-protected property interest. Document #1 at 31, ¶101 (citing Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985)). But Hawkins was, and is, an at-will employee, so she does not have a property interest in continued employment upon which a due process claim could be based. See Skeets v. Johnson, 816 F.2d 1213, 1214 (8th Cir. 1987). It is well-established that property interests "are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law." Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972). "Under Arkansas law, an at will employee is one who can be terminated at any time without cause. The employer's right to so terminate the employee is unconditional and absolute." Skeets, 816 F.2d at 1214. It does not matter whether the employment is public or private. Id.
Hawkins does not dispute that she is an at-will employee, but she argues that she had a property interest in continued employment through DHS's own pre-termination procedures. See Document #37 at 26. Specifically, she claims that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled her to a pre-termination hearing. Id. The due process clause requires some kind of a hearing prior to the discharge of an employee who has a constitutionally-protected property interest in her employment, but as the Court explained, Hawkins has no such interest [*33]  as an at-will employee. Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542, 105 S. Ct. at 1493-94. Therefore, her section 1983 claim fails as a matter of law.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Document #27. Vivian Hawkins's individual capacity claims against Cindy Gillespie, Brenda Jackson, Steven Petersen, Kevin Stacker, and Zofia Higginbotham are dismissed with prejudice. The FMLA retaliation claim, the section 1983 claim, and the common law claims for outrage and battery are dismissed with prejudice. The ADA and Section 504 failure to accommodate and retaliation claims survive. Because no claims remain against Zofia Higginbotham, she is dismissed as a party.
IT IS SO ORDERED this 3rd day of April, 2017.
