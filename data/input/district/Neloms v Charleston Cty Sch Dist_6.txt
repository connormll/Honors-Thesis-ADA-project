Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is before the Court upon Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 18). Pursuant to the provisions of Title 28, United States Code, Section 636(b)(1) and Local Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g), D.S.C., all pretrial matters in employment discrimination cases are referred to a United States Magistrate Judge for consideration. For the reasons set forth herein, the undersigned recommends that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 18) be granted.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff was hired by Defendant as a guidance counselor in 2002. (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 9; Dkt. No. 18-22 at 14:2-5.) In August 2013, Defendant promoted Plaintiff to Director of Guidance and Counseling Services K-12 for the entire Charleston County School District (the "District"). (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 8; Dkt. No. 18-22 at 13:17-14:1.) At the time Plaintiff accepted the [*2]  position, the "job purpose" was described as follows:
The Director of Guidance and Counseling Services for grades CD-12 will provide leadership toward the implementation of the comprehensive school counseling program at the school, district and state level. Their primary responsibilities will include: providing leadership in the process of hiring qualified, diverse professional school counselors, advocating for programs and services that lead to student academic, social and career success for all students, and articulate and advocate the connection between strong guidance programs and school improvement.
(Dkt. No. 18-2.) More specifically, Plaintiff's primary functions included the following responsibilities:
1. Provides leadership and supervision in planning, implementing, and evaluating the Comprehensive School Guidance program for the school district as aligned with national and state standards
2. Supervises research and data analysis to determine the effectiveness of academic and instructional support services in the areas of Professional School Counseling
3. Work collaboratively to provide guidance, support and leadership with the district's Associate Superintendents in the Elementary, [*3]  Secondary, Middle School, CPN and Innovation Zone Learning Communities
4. Develops, monitors, and maintains program budgets and expenditures for student support service programs, scholarships and financial aid reports
5. Provides leadership and guidance to professional school counselors by direct consultation with counselors and through school principals
6. Collaborates with Curriculum & Instruction, Career Technology, School Psychological Services, Services for Exceptional Children Department staff and other offices as identified by district administration
7. Collects data and prepares reports regarding counseling services, high school graduates, and post secondary student options and outcomes
8. Oversees the Crisis Intervention Plan and Team for the District and schools in collaboration with School Psychologists, School Nurses and external partners
9. Provides leadership and supervision to ensure District compliance with regulations and laws concerning school attendance, child abuse/neglect reporting, suicide protocol and training
10. Provide leadership in the evaluation process to ensure school counselor performance appraisal is aligned with the appropriate role of the professional school [*4]  counselor
11. Provide individual and group supervision to school counselors in practice by planning, scheduling and facilitating monthly professional school counselor meetings
(Id.)
After accepting the role as director, Plaintiff claims that she was assigned additional job duties outside the scope of her original job description. (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 11.) For example, around August 2015, Plaintiff was tasked with administering and overseeing a multimillion-dollar federal grant called "Gear Up" during an internal audit process1 (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 12; Dkt. No. 18-22 at 15:4-16); undertaking sole responsibility for managing the District's Crisis Intervention Plan and Team, which handled student deaths and suicides2 (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 16:5-21); answering complaints from the District's Bully Prevention Hotline (id. at 18:8-21); managing and compiling content for the District's "Program of Studies" database, which is a comprehensive compilation of District courses (id. at 18:22-19:9); activating all of Defendant's high school courses in a program called "Power School" (id. at 19:10-17); administering a scholarship program for the District (id. at 19:18-20:8); serving as a test coordinator for the Preliminary [*5]  Scholastic Aptitude Test ("PSAT") (id. at 20:9-15); coordinating the District's child sexual assault training (id. at 20:17-21:4); overseeing bus driver training sessions on bullying prevention (id. at 21:5-12); managing any incoming petitions for high school diplomas (id. at 21:9-22:2); creating a performance evaluation system for school counselors (id. at 22:3-6); and overseeing District-wide implementation of a software system called "Naviance" (Dkt. No. 18-18 at 2). (See also Dkt. No. 19 at 2-3; Dkt. No. 18-18 at 2-3.)
Plaintiff claims that she did not receive training or support for these additional duties, particularly in relation to administering the federal grant, and that the extra tasks "required extensive time" and "resulted in her inability to perform her regular job." (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶¶ 11, 19.) According to Plaintiff, she "continued to ask for help" throughout the fall of 2015 (id. ¶¶ 14, 20), and at some point in September 2015, Defendant hired a program manager, Chameeka Smith, to assist Plaintiff with the internal audit of the Gear Up grant. (Dkt. No. 18-5).
Around this same time, on September 30, 2015, the Post & Courier published an article stating that Defendant faced [*6]  an $18 million budget shortfall "after overestimating property-tax revenues and miscalculating payroll costs." (Dkt. No. 18-3; Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 17.) Based on a memorandum from the District Superintendent, the Post & Courier published a subsequent article on November 23, 2015, identifying the various line items in Defendant's budget that led to the shortfall. (Dkt. No. 18-4.) Specifically, the article stated that the District overspent on certain services, programs, and materials, including "$841,000 in the Guidance Department." (Id.)
Although the article did not name Plaintiff, she felt the article implicated her in relation to the Guidance Department's overspending because the article was published during her tenure as director. (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 18; Dkt. No. 19-4 ¶¶ 2-3.) Plaintiff contacted the District Superintendent and Legal Department to clarify that she was not the Director of Guidance and Counseling Services at the time of the overspending and requested that they contact the Post & Courier to "correct the defamatory inference." (Dkt. No. 19-4 ¶¶ 4-5.) Plaintiff claims that she drafted a rebuttal statement, but the District refused to publish the statement to "restore [her] reputation." [*7]  (Id. ¶¶ 6-7.)
On July 29, 2016, Smith resigned from her position as project manager of the grant for another opportunity. (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 21; Dkt. No. 18-5; Dkt. No. 18-22 at 58:14-18.) Plaintiff claims that she had become "so stressed about administering [the grant] that she was often in tears and she started being treated for depression." (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 22.) During a meeting with her supervisor, Michelle English-Watson, and several internal auditors, Plaintiff broke down crying and expressed that she was overwhelmed with administering the grant. (Id.; Dkt. No. 18-23 at 33:3-21.) Following this meeting, English-Watson informed the District Superintendent that Plaintiff needed help with the grant and asked that the District hire another individual to manage the organization of the audit documents "to take that off [Plaintiff's] plate." (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 22; Dkt. No. 18-23 at 33:3-35:9.) By August 5, 2016, Defendant hired a temporary employee, Cindy Smalls, to assist with the organization of documents for the audit. (Dkt. No. 18-5; Dkt. No. 18-22 at 59:20-60:15; Dkt. No. 19-4 ¶ 10.) In September 2016, Defendant also hired Donna Newton to assist Plaintiff as her secretary. (Dkt. No. 18-22 [*8]  at 59:8-15; Dkt. No. 19 at 10 n.6.) Defendant hired Dennis Muhammed in October 2016 to replace Smith as project manager of the grant. (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 59:16-19.)
Plaintiff claims she suffered additional stress over the Christmas holiday and worried about returning to work because she was unable to meet the District's December 2016 deadline to revise the Program of Studies database. (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 24; see also Dkt. No. 18-18 at 4, stating that Plaintiff "continued to feel pressured because [she] was being told that [the Program of Studies] was taking too long and that schools needed it to begin scheduling.") Moreover, Smalls' temporary role in assisting with the grant audit ended in January 2017, which caused Plaintiff further stress. (Dkt. No. 19-4 ¶ 10.) On January 2, 2017, Plaintiff began to experience migraines so severe that she had to go to the hospital. (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 25; Dkt. No. 18-18 at 4.)
On or around the evening of February 12, 2017, Defendant needed a crisis team to respond to a student death at North Charleston Elementary School; however, the District did not notify Plaintiff of the crisis through the established protocol, and Plaintiff was able to respond to the crisis [*9]  only because she happened to look at her work email that night. (Dkt. No. 18-18 at 4-5.) According to Plaintiff, "[c]risis response is already a very stressful process and it is made even more stressful when the district does not follow established protocols." (Id. at 5.) Shortly thereafter, "Plaintiff suffered a mental breakdown and was unable to work due to severe stress and panic attacks and migraines." (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶¶ 23-27.) On February 16, 2017, Plaintiff's physician submitted certification forms to Defendant pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), indicating that Plaintiff was "having difficulty functioning through increased anxiety, sadness, and decreased motivation," and that she needed approximately two weeks of FMLA leave. (Dkt. No. 18-7; Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 29.)
On February 17, 2017, at 8:17 a.m., Plaintiff's supervisor, English-Watson, sent Plaintiff an email stating:
Amy,
I am sadden [sic] that you are not feeling well and understand your need to take FMLA. Please take care of yourself as directed by your physician so that you may have a healthy and speedy recovery.
You have an important role in the district which includes many responsibilities. To be sure that your responsible [*10]  tasks do not fall into the cracks, would you please send to me any projects and the timeline that your office needs to implement while you are out on leave from the district.
Looking forward to receiving your list of specific tasks and due dates before you complete your FMLA paperwork for submission.
(Dkt. No. 18-10.) Plaintiff responded to English-Waston's email at 11:49 a.m. with a list of "critical areas to consider." (Id.; Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 30.) According to Plaintiff, the email took her "several hours" to write. (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 101:2-8.) That same day, Defendant approved Plaintiff's request for fulltime leave until February 27, 2017.3 (Dkt. No. 18-9.) Defendant later approved Plaintiff's request to extend her fulltime FMLA leave to March 28, 2017. (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 75:6-10.)
On March 28, 2017, Plaintiff returned to work on intermittent leave with a modified schedule of four hours per day.4 (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶¶ 31-32.) Although Plaintiff initially requested only two weeks of intermittent leave, Defendant agreed to extend her part-time schedule on two more occasions, such that Plaintiff was approved to work four-hour days until May 26, 2017. (Dkt. No. 18-12.) Despite this arrangement, Plaintiff [*11]  claims that she had to work more than four hours each day because she "still was expected to do the same amount of work, but in the four-hour time frame." (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 77:7-13; Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶¶ 33-34.) Plaintiff alleges that she often worked four and a half hours each day, as "it was difficult to leave the office with all she was expected to accomplish." (Dkt. No. 19 at 4 n.2; Dkt. No. 19-4 ¶ 14.)
Plaintiff also claims that she occasionally had to work from home to keep up with certain responsibilities, such as overseeing the District scholarship program, and, on those days, she worked over four hours. (Dkt. 19-1 at 112:21-24, 113:25-114:2.) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant sometimes scheduled meetings during her four hours of daily intermittent leave. (Id. at 111:8-15.) Plaintiff acknowledges that she did not attend these meetings, and that no one ever directed her to work more hours than permitted under her reduced schedule. (Id. at 111:16-112:3, 114:6-17.)
On April 6, 2017, Plaintiff met with English-Watson to discuss her workload—more specifically, her responsibilities with respect to the District's Crisis Team. (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 77:12-18; Dkt. No. 18-23 at 48:16-24.) [*12]  During the meeting, Plaintiff reiterated that Defendant had assigned her too many additional responsibilities and that she was operating as a "department of one." (Dkt. No. 19-8.) Plaintiff claims that she requested that Defendant return the additional job duties to those District employees and/or departments initially responsible, or that Defendant hire new employees to take control of such tasks. In particular, Plaintiff "requested the accommodation of returning some of the Crisis Team responsibilities to other Defendant employees, consistent with [her] job description." (Dkt. No. 19-4 ¶ 12; Dkt. No. 19-1 at 133:1-9, 134:22-135:17; Dkt. No. 19 at 5.) Plaintiff claims that she also asked that the IT Department retake "ownership" over Naviance, and that the Curriculum Department do the same for the Program of Studies. (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 134:22-17.) Plaintiff also claims that she asked Defendant to temporarily redistribute some of her standard job duties so that she could make meaningful use of her four hours of leave. (Dkt. No. 19 at 5.)
English-Watson told Plaintiff that her responsibilities pertaining to the Crisis Team were part of her job description and, thus, Plaintiff was expected [*13]  to continue overseeing those duties. (Dkt. No. 18-23 at 48:16-49:13; Dkt. No. 18-22 at 121:3-17.) Ultimately, Plaintiff and English-Watson agreed that it would be best for Plaintiff to meet with Employee Relations because, as Plaintiff puts it, their "conversation was going nowhere." (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 120:20-121:1; Dkt. No. 18-23 at 49:7-13.) Accordingly, on April 18, 2017, Plaintiff sent an email to Wilbert Suggs and Beverly Varnado from Employee Relations describing the lack of support she had received from Defendant in relation to her growing workload and the health issues she was experiencing as a result. (Dkt. No. 18-18; Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶ 34.) Specifically, Plaintiff wrote, "The job description that was advertised when I applied and interviewed for the position of Director of K-12 Guidance & Counseling has morphed into a rather enormous role." (Dkt. No. 18-18.) In addition to the accommodations referenced above, Plaintiff's email requested that Defendant also hire a coordinator to assist her with operational responsibilities in light of the additional roles "being added to [her] division on a regular basis."5 (Id.; Dkt. No. 19-1 at 133:13-134:21.)
Over the next several weeks, Plaintiff [*14]  continued to communicate with Employee Relations regarding her job duties and possible accommodations. (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 126:21-127:6.) Plaintiff met with Suggs and Varnardo on two occasions: on or around April 26, 2017 (id. at 125:6-9; Dkt. No. 18-17), and again on May 8, 2017 (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 124:18-125:16; Dkt. 18-19).6 On May 16, 2017, Plaintiff requested to return to fulltime FMLA leave and Defendant approved her request. (Dkt. No. 18-13.) On May 20, 2017, while Plaintiff was on leave, English-Watson texted Plaintiff and told her that Defendant needed a Crisis Team at Wando High School "first thing Monday morning" and that Plaintiff needed to call her "ASAP." (Dkt. No. 19-6.) Plaintiff claims that English-Watson repeatedly called her personal phone regarding the crisis at Wando High School until Plaintiff's husband finally answered and informed English-Watson that Plaintiff was on leave. (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 128:10-130:2.)
At some point during this period of leave, Plaintiff interviewed for and accepted a new position with Berkeley County School District as lead counselor at Westview Middle School. (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 87:12-89:13.) Plaintiff submitted a resignation letter to Defendant [*15]  on or around June 6, 2017, which stated: "I am resigning my position as K-12 Guidance & Counseling Director effective June 30, 2017. I will be taking a position with the Berkeley County School District. Thank you for affording me the opportunities to grow as an educator. I wish only the best for Charleston County School District." (Dkt. No. 19-7.) Defendant accepted Plaintiff's resignation and allowed her to remain on paid leave until June 30, 2017.7 (Dkt. No. 18-15; Dkt. No. 19-1 at 131:8-14.) At some point later that summer, English-Watson amended the job description for Director of Guidance and Counseling Services and split the position into two separate roles—one director and one coordinator—given the size of the District. (Dkt. No. 18-23 at 20:19-21:13.)
On December 8, 2017, Plaintiff filed this action in the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas, Charleston County, (Dkt. No. 1-1), and Defendant removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina on February 5, 2018 (Dkt. No. 1). Plaintiff's Complaint alleges three causes of action against Defendant: (1) denial of reasonable accommodation in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.; (2) interference [*16]  and retaliation in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.; and (3) defamation by innuendo. (Dkt. No. 1-1.) On January 4, 2019, Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking dismissal of all of Plaintiff's claims. (Dkt. No. 18.) Plaintiff filed her Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on January 17, 2019, (Dkt. No. 19), and Defendant filed its Reply on January 22, 2019, (Dkt. No. 20).

LEGAL STANDARD
Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment "shall" be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "Facts are 'material' when they might affect the outcome of the case, and a 'genuine issue' exists when the evidence would allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party." The News & Observer Publ'g Co. v. Raleigh-Durham Airport Auth., 597 F.3d 570, 576 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing Anderson v. 1Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, "the nonmoving party's evidence is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in that party's favor." See id. (quoting Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 552, 119 S. Ct. 1545, 143 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1999)); see also Perini Corp. v. Perini Constr., Inc., 915 F.2d 121, 123-24 (4th Cir. 1990). However, "the nonmoving party must rely on more than conclusory allegations, mere speculation, the building of one inference upon another, [*17]  or the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." Dash v. Mayweather, 731 F.3d 303, 311 (4th Cir. 2013).

DISCUSSION

I. Failure to Accommodate in Violation of the Rehabilitation Act
Employment discrimination claims brought under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are evaluated using the same standards as those applied under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"). 29 U.S.C. § 794(d). To establish a prima facie claim of failure to accommodate under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) she was a qualified person with a disability; (2) the employer had notice of the disability; (3) the plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the position with a reasonable accommodation; and (4) the employer nonetheless refused to make the accommodation. See Hannah P. v. Coats, 916 F.3d 327, 337 (4th Cir. 2019) (referencing Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cty., 789 F.3d 407, 414 (4th Cir. 2015)).
The Rehabilitation Act does not require an employer to provide the exact accommodation requested by an employee. See id. at 338 (referencing Reyazuddin, 789 F.3d at 415). Rather, the employer has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations and may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier to provide. Clark v. Sch. Dist. Five of Lexington & Richland Ctys., 247 F. Supp. 3d 734, 746 (D.S.C. 2017) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). "Nonetheless, a reasonable accommodation should provide a meaningful employment opportunity. [*18]  Meaningful equal employment opportunity means an opportunity to attain the same level of performance as is available to nondisabled employees having similar skills and abilities." See id. (citing Reyazuddin, 789 F.3d at 416). Whether an accommodation is reasonable is a generally a question of fact for the jury. Id. at 749.
To determine an appropriate reasonable accommodation, it may be necessary for the employer to initiate an informal, interactive process with the employee in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations. See id. at 745 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)). Both the employer and the individual seeking an accommodation have a duty to engage in good faith in the interactive process. Id. Neither party should be able to cause a breakdown in the process for the purpose of either avoiding or inflicting liability; a party that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith, and a party that fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may also be acting in bad faith. See id. (citing Crabill v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 423 F. App'x. 314, 323 (4th Cir. 2011)). This interactive process requirement is "implicit in the fourth element" of a plaintiff's [*19]  prima facie case for failure to accommodate. See id. (citing Haneke v. Mid—Atlantic Capital Mgmt., 131 F. App'x. 399, 400 (4th Cir. 2005)).
In the instant case, Defendant argues that the Court should dismiss Plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate8 because (1) Plaintiff failed to identify a reasonable accommodation that Defendant refused to consider, and (2) Plaintiff ended the interactive process by resigning her employment while on leave. (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 14-18.) As discussed above, Plaintiff requested several accommodations during her tenure as director, including that Defendant: redistribute those "additional" duties outside the scope of her position (e.g., overseeing the Gear Up grant) to the employees and/or departments initially responsible, or to new hires; hire a coordinator to assist Plaintiff with her operational duties; and temporarily reassign some of Plaintiff's normal job responsibilities while on intermittent FMLA leave. (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 13-16; Dkt. No. 19 at 5.)
Defendant argues that those "additional" responsibilities complained of by Plaintiff were essential functions of her job and, as such, Plaintiff's request that Defendant redistribute such tasks [*20]  to other employees or to new hires was not reasonable under the Rehabilitation Act. (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 15-16.) See, e.g., Lewis v. Gibson, 621 F. App'x 163, 165 (4th Cir. 2015) (noting that the Rehabilitation Act does not require an employer to hire an additional person to perform the essential functions of a disabled employee's position); Crabill, 423 F. App'x at 323 (stating that an employer is not required to reallocate essential job functions to other employees because an accommodation that would require other employees to work harder is unreasonable); but cf. Reyazuddin, 754 F. App'x at 189-90 (stating that while the Rehabilitation Act does not require an employer to reallocate essential functions, "[r]easonable accommodations can include reallocating marginal functions to another employee") (emphasis added); Butler v. Pepperdam Constr. Co., Inc., No. CV 2:17-1350-RMG, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47663, 2019 WL 1306190, at *3 (D.S.C. Mar. 22, 2019) (same). For this same reason, Defendant claims that Plaintiff's requests to temporarily reassign her essential job duties while on intermittent FMLA leave and to hire a coordinator to assist with her operational responsibilities were also unreasonable. (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 15-16.)
A job function is essential when "'the reason the position exists is to perform that function,' when there [are not] enough employees available to perform the [*21]  function, or when the function is so specialized that someone is hired specifically because of his or her expertise in performing that function." See Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 579 (4th Cir. 2015) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)). In evaluating job functions, the court must consider "the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." Clark, 247 F. Supp. 3d at 744.
With respect to Plaintiff's undisputed essential functions, the undersigned agrees that Defendant was not obligated to hire a coordinator to assist Plaintiff with her operational responsibilities, or to temporarily reassign Plaintiff's essential work duties to other employees. See Stephenson v. Pfizer, Inc., 641 F. App'x 214, 219 (4th Cir. 2016) (noting that an employer is not obligated "to reassign any of the essential functions of a disabled employee," or "to hire additional employees to perform an essential function"). Additionally, the undersigned agrees with Defendant that many of the "additional" job duties identified by Plaintiff were part and parcel of her role as Director of Guidance and Counseling Services and, thus, reassignment of such duties and/or hiring new [*22]  personnel to handle such duties also would have been unreasonable.9 The undersigned finds a question of fact, however, as to whether overseeing the Gear Up grant, facilitating the implementation of Naviance, and managing the District's Program of Studies database were intended as essential functions of Plaintiff's job. Indeed, these responsibilities were not overtly included in Plaintiff's job description and seem to require certain skill sets and expertise outside the scope of Plaintiff's original position. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 19-1 at 15:6-16, 23:10-24:2.) Further, during the meeting on April 6, 2017, Plaintiff's supervisor, English-Watson, seemed to acknowledge that certain duties outside of Plaintiff's job description had been "added" to Plaintiff's workload and that Plaintiff needed support in handling these additional tasks.10 (See Dkt. No. 19-8.)
However, even assuming that some of these additional duties were not essential functions of Plaintiff's job and that her requests to redistribute such duties were reasonable, the undersigned finds that Defendant granted Plaintiff's requests for accommodation all [*23]  the same. First, Defendant hired Chameeka Smith as program manager of the Gear Up grant. (Dkt. No. 18-5; Dkt. No. 18-23.) When Smith resigned, Defendant not only hired a replacement, Dennis Muhammed, but also a temporary employee, Cindy Smalls, to assist with organizing documents for the internal audit. (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 59:16-60:15.) English-Watson also "brought in a team" to handle the student "activity code booklet." (Id. at 47:2-8.) With respect to Plaintiff's undisputed essential duties, although not legally obligated, Defendant hired a secretary, Donna Newton, to assist Plaintiff in her day-to-day administrative functions. (Id.) Moreover, Defendant approved each of Plaintiff's requests for FMLA leave, providing Plaintiff with over twelve weeks of leave with fulltime pay and benefits. (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 86:10-86:6; Dkt. No. 18-1 at 8.)
In fact, Defendant was in the process of negotiating even further accommodations for Plaintiff when she terminated the ongoing interactive process by submitting her resignation to Defendant. Indeed, after receiving Plaintiff's email on April 18, 2017, Employee Relations met with Plaintiff twice to discuss possible accommodations in relation to her [*24]  health issues. (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 124:18-125:16; Dkt. No. 18-19.) As part of these discussions, Employee Relations then began the process of distinguishing which duties had been added to Plaintiff's job description and the impact those duties had on her evolving workload. (Dkt. No. 18-20; Dkt. No. 18-21.) However, Plaintiff returned to fulltime FMLA leave only eight days after meeting with Employee Relations, and then submitted her resignation less than one month later. (Dkt. No. 18-13; Dkt. No. 18-14.) Accordingly, the undersigned agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff terminated the interactive process before Defendant could make a decision regarding an appropriate accommodation plan.
Plaintiff argues that she did not voluntarily terminate the interactive process, but rather, was forced to resign her employment "for her health." (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 141:23-142:8.) According to Plaintiff, her condition worsened because Defendant failed to provide adequate accommodations and took over six weeks to determine a reasonable plan. (Dkt. No. 19 at 10-11, 13-15.) In other words, Plaintiff seems to suggest that she was constructively discharged.11 (See id. at 14, referencing the elements of constructive discharge). [*25]  Plaintiff's argument fails for several reasons.
At the outset, there is no evidence in the record that Defendant deliberately attempted to drive Plaintiff from her job.12 To the contrary, Defendant took a number of steps to enable Plaintiff to continue her role as Director of Guidance and Counseling Services, such as providing Plaintiff with more paid leave than required by law, hiring additional personnel to assist Plaintiff, and actively pursuing further accommodations for Plaintiff following her complaints to Employee Relations.13 (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 8.) See Brady v. Bd. of Educ. of Prince George's Cty., 222 F. Supp. 3d 459, 475-76 (D. Md. 2016), aff'd, 707 Fed. Appx. 780 (4th Cir. 2018) (noting that to the extent an employee is displeased with an accommodation, a partial or imperfect attempt to accommodate an employee does not give rise to constructive discharge).
Further, there is no "hard and fast rule" with respect to the interactive process, Clark, 247 F. Supp. 3d at 745; rather, "[t]he Federal Regulations envision an interactive process" that is "flexible." Walter v. United Airlines, Inc., 232 F.3d 892 (4th Cir. 2000). Indeed, the Rehabilitation Act does not require Defendant to provide Plaintiff with a "perfect" accommodation, nor does it require Defendant to determine a reasonable accommodation immediately upon Plaintiff's demand. See, e.g., Adams v. Anne Arundel Cty. Pub. Sch., 789 F.3d 422, 432 (4th Cir. 2015) (finding two-month interval between employee's request for accommodation and employer's determination of accommodation reasonable and timely for purposes of interactive process). The Rehabilitation Act requires only that Defendant participate in good faith and make "reasonable efforts to help [Plaintiff] determine what specific accommodations are necessary." Clark 247 F. Supp. 3d at 745. As evidenced above, there are no signs of failure to participate in good faith by Defendant and, because she resigned while the interactive process was ongoing, Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendant refused to accommodate her. See Clark 247 F. Supp. 3d at 745 (noting that employer is not liable when the employee breaks down the interactive process). Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot establish the fourth prong of [*27]  her prima facie claim and the undersigned therefore recommends granting Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's first cause of action for failure to accommodate.

II. Interference in Violation of the FMLA14
To make out an interference claim under the FMLA, an employee must demonstrate that: (1) she is entitled to an FMLA benefit; (2) her employer interfered with the provision of that benefit; and (3) that the interference caused harm. See Adams, 789 F.3d at 427 (referencing Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 89, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002)). "Generally, requiring an employee to perform work during FMLA leave constitutes interference with that employee's FMLA rights." Chauncey v. Life Cycle Eng'g, Inc., No. 2:12-CV-968-DCN, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140579, 2013 WL 5468237, at *13 (D.S.C. Sept. 30, 2013). Other examples of interference include violating the FMLA, refusing to authorize FMLA leave, discouraging an employee from taking FMLA leave, and manipulating the work force to avoid responsibilities under the FMLA. See Dodgens v. Kent Mfg. Co., 955 F. Supp. 560, 564 (D.S.C. 1997) (referencing 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(b)).
In order to succeed on a claim for interference with the exercise of FMLA rights, the employee must prove not only interference, but also that the violation prejudiced her in some way. See Ranade v. BT Americas, Inc., 581 F. App'x 182, 184 (4th Cir. 2014) (citing Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89); see also 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1). An employee may establish prejudice by showing that she lost compensation or benefits "by reason of [*28]  the violation," 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I); sustained other monetary losses "as a direct result of the violation," id. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(II); or suffered some loss in employment status remediable through "appropriate" equitable relief, such as employment, reinstatement, or promotion, id. § 2617(a)(1)(B). In assessing whether prejudice occurred, the court must consider "whether the employee would have exercised his or her FMLA rights in the absence of the employer's actions," including "what steps the employee would have taken had circumstances been different." Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 91.
Here, Defendant agues that Plaintiff's claim of FMLA interference should be dismissed because (1) actionable FMLA interference does not include de minimus work-related contact, and (2) as an arm of the State of South Carolina, Defendant is immune from Plaintiff's FMLA claim pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment. (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 18-22.) The Court first addresses Defendant's sovereign immunity argument.

A. Sovereign Immunity
The FMLA's "self-care" provision requires employers, including state employers, to allow employees to take unpaid leave to care for their own serious health conditions.15 See Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland, 566 U.S. 30, 33, 132 S. Ct. 1327, 182 L. Ed. 2d 296, (2012) (referencing 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D)). Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, states and their agencies, as sovereigns, are immune from suit for damages in federal [*29]  court unless Congress abrogates that immunity. Id. at 35. In the instant case, it is well-established that Congress did not validly abrogate states' sovereign immunity from suits for money damages in enacting the FMLA's self-care provision. Coleman, 566 U.S. at 43. Given that Defendant is an arm of the State of South Carolina,16 and Plaintiff has alleged interference with respect to her self-care, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff's FMLA claim is barred to the extent she seeks monetary damages. See, e.g., Stroman v. York Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. CV 0:18-1632-JMC-PJG, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20519, 2019 WL 498387, at *3 (D.S.C. Feb. 8, 2019) (dismissing plaintiff's FMLA self-care claim based on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity); McKay v. Med. Univ. of S.C., No. CV 2:17-45-RMG-BM, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128799, 2017 WL 9250345, at *3 (D.S.C. July 19, 2017), adopted, No. CV 2:17-45-RMG, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128465, 2017 WL 3477799 (D.S.C. Aug. 14, 2017) (same).

B. Merits
Plaintiff asserts that her FMLA claim is limited to "reinstatement to her job as Director of K-12 Guidance and Counseling," and is therefore permissible under the Eleventh Amendment. (Dkt. No. 19 at 15.) See McKay, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128799, 2017 WL 9250345, at *3 (noting that a state agency generally is not immune to self-care claims seeking equitable relief). To the extent Plaintiff's FMLA claim is limited to reinstatement, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's cause of action still fails as a matter of law because she has failed to demonstrate any actionable interference [*30]  with her FMLA rights. (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 18-20; Dkt. No. 20 at 8-9.) The undersigned agrees.
At the outset, Plaintiff was not denied any of her requests for FMLA leave; to the contrary, Defendant gave Plaintiff more leave than required by statute and allowed Plaintiff to retain her position as Director of Guidance and Counseling Services during and upon her return from FMLA leave. (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 86:10-87:6; Dkt. No. 18-1 at 8.) Instead, Plaintiff claims that Defendant interfered with her rights under the FMLA by (1) forcing her to maintain a fulltime, eight-hour workload while she was working a modified four-hour schedule on intermittent leave, and (2) requiring her to work while she was on fulltime FMLA leave. (Dkt. No. 19 at 16-17.) (See supra pp. 6-10.)
With respect to Plaintiff's first contention, the undersigned finds that an employer is not legally obligated to alter an employee's workload while he or she is on intermittent FMLA leave. Although the Fourth Circuit has yet to address this issue directly, other courts have found that, in the absence of any decision or regulation stating otherwise, the FMLA does not mandate adjusting an employee's workload or performance expectations while he [*31]  or she is on FMLA-qualifying leave.17 Plaintiff has failed to provide this Court with any such decision or regulation; thus, without any legal basis to expand the protections of the FMLA as proposed by Plaintiff, the undersigned declines to do so here.18
Moreover, as Defendant correctly notes, no one directed Plaintiff to work more than four hours per day while she was on her reduced schedule or to attend meetings that occurred during her four hours of daily intermittent leave. (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 111:16-112:3, 114:6-17.) See Antekeier v. Lab. Corp. of Am., 295 F. Supp. 3d 679, 685 (E.D. Va. 2018) (finding no interference where none of defendant's employees told plaintiff that she needed to work while she was on FMLA leave or respond to emails or telephone calls she received). Thus, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that Defendant interfered with her rights under the FMLA based solely on the fact that she was subject to her standard workload and performance expectations while on intermittent leave.
With respect to her second contention, Plaintiff alleges that English-Watson instructed Plaintiff to continue working while she was on fulltime FMLA [*32]  leave when she (1) sent Plaintiff an email on February 17, 2017, requesting that Plaintiff notify her of any outstanding projects or deadlines the Guidance Department may need to manage in Plaintiff's absence (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 101:2-8; Dkt. No. 18-10); and (2) attempted to contact Plaintiff regarding a crisis at Wando High School on May 20, 2017 (Dkt. No. 19-6; Dkt. No. 19-1 at 128:10-130:2).
The mere fact that an employer communicates with an employee while he or she is on FMLA leave is not per se evidence of interference. Chauncey, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140579, 2013 WL 5468237, at *13. Indeed, "actionable interference is not triggered by contacts . . . amounting to no more than de minimis work-related contact." Antekeier, 295 F. Supp. 3d at 685. For example, "fielding occasional calls about one's job while on leave is a professional courtesy that does not abrogate or interfere with the exercise of an employee's FMLA rights." See Chauncey, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140579, 2013 WL 5468237, at *13 (finding that email asking plaintiff where her coworkers could find certain information while she was on FMLA leave was de minimis and did not give rise to a claim for interference). English-Watson's request that Plaintiff provide information regarding outstanding projects that may need attention during Plaintiff's absence falls squarely within the [*33]  purview of de minimis contact and, thus, does not give rise to an interference claim. See Antekeier, 295 F. Supp. 3d at 685 (finding no interference where plaintiff was repeatedly asked for information regarding client accounts while on FMLA leave).
Given that Plaintiff did not respond to English-Watson's phone calls or messages regarding the crisis at Wando High School, the undersigned finds it is also unlikely that English-Watson's calls interfered with Plaintiff's FMLA leave. (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 128:10-130:2.) However, viewing the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the undersigned finds there may be a question of fact as to whether English-Watson's calls directing Plaintiff to respond to the crisis at Wando High School exceeded de minimis contact. See Chauncey, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140579, 2013 WL 5468237, at *13 (noting that calling an employee can be probative of interference when the employee is asked to continue working). Nonetheless, even if the Court concludes that English-Watson's calls interfered with Plaintiff's leave, the FMLA "provides no relief unless the employee has been prejudiced by the violation." See Vannoy v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Richmond, 827 F.3d 296, 302 (4th Cir. 2016) (referencing Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89).
As stated above, in order to establish prejudice, Plaintiff must show that she sustained some sort of monetary loss [*34]  as a direct result of Defendant's violation, or that she suffered some loss in her employment status. See Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89 (referencing 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)). Plaintiff does not allege that she was disciplined or harmed in any way—monetary or otherwise—for failing to respond to English-Watson's messages regarding the crisis at Wando High School.19 Rather, Plaintiff claims that Defendant's interference with her FMLA leave increased her stress level, worsened her health condition, and forced her to resign. (Dkt. No. 19 at 17.) Plaintiff's decision to resign from her employment, however, does not constitute the type of "prejudice" contemplated by the FMLA, especially in light of Defendant's generosity with respect to her leave.
Indeed, courts have rejected claims of prejudice in cases with facts far more severe than those presented here. For example, in Wonasue v. University of Maryland Alumni Association, 984 F. Supp. 2d 480 (D. Md. 2013), the plaintiff claimed that her health condition worsened and she was forced to resign after the defendant denied her request for leave, changed her work schedule to make it less accommodating, and gave her an impossible set of tasks and timeframe in which to perform them. However, the court found no prejudice because, although plaintiff felt compelled to resign, she remained [*35]  employed after her request for leave was denied and did not allege any loss in compensation or benefits by the defendant. Id. at 485.
Here, Defendant approved each of Plaintiff's leave requests and provided Plaintiff with over twelve weeks of paid leave and benefits. (Dkt. No. 19-1 at 86:10-86:6; Dkt. No. 18-1 at 8.) In fact, even after Plaintiff submitted her resignation, Defendant continued to employ Plaintiff and provide her with fulltime paid leave and benefits. (Dkt. No. 18-15; Dkt. No. 19-1 at 131:8-14.) Accordingly, the undersigned is constrained to agree with Defendant that Plaintiff has failed to show that she was prejudiced by any alleged interference with her FMLA leave and, thus, Plaintiff cannot establish the final element of her FMLA claim. For these reasons, the undersigned recommends that the Court grant Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's second cause of action.

III. Defamation by Innuendo
To establish defamation under South Carolina law, the plaintiff must show (1) a false and defamatory statement concerning another; (2) an unprivileged publication to a third party; (3) fault on the part of the publisher; and (4) either actionability of the statement irrespective [*36]  of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication. See McKay, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128799, 2017 WL 9250345, at *6 (citing Murray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 542 S.E.2d 743, 748 (S.C. Ct. App. 2001)). A statement may be actionable per se if it is both false and defamatory and suggests, among other things, "unfitness in one's business or profession." See id. (referencing Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, 332 S.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d 497, 508-09 (S.C. 1998)).
Defamation may also be accomplished "through inference, implication, innuendo or insinuation, as well as through direct reference." See Jeter v. Allstate Ins. Co., No. CV 7:15-1458-TMC, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 196196, 2016 WL 7115912, at *10 (D.S.C. Aug. 22, 2016) (citing Wilhoit v. WCSC, Inc., 293 S.C. 34, 358 S.E.2d 397, 400 (S.C. Ct. App. 1987)). Indeed, a "mere insinuation is as actionable as a positive assertion if it is false and malicious and the meaning is plain." See Toussaint v. Palmetto Health, No. CV 3:15-02778-MGL, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71775, 2017 WL 1950955, at *2 (D.S.C. May 10, 2017) (citing Tyler v. Macks Stores of S.C., Inc., 275 S.C. 456, 272 S.E.2d 633, 634 (S.C. 1980)). While truth is a complete defense to defamation, an untrue innuendo or inference drawn from a true statement may nonetheless give rise to liability. See Jeter, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 196196, 2016 WL 7115912, at *10 (referencing Adams v. Daily Tel. Co., 292 S.C. 273, 356 S.E.2d 118, 122 (S.C. Ct. App. 1986)). The inference must, however, be reasonable. See id. (referencing Fountain v. First Reliance Bank, 398 S.C. 434, 443, 730 S.E.2d 305 (2012)).
Here, Plaintiff claims that the Post & Courier improperly inferred that Plaintiff contributed to the mismanagement of the District's budget because the article cited overspending by the Guidance Department and, at the time of publication, Plaintiff was the Director of Guidance and Counseling Services. (Dkt. No. 1-1 ¶¶ 17-18; [*37]  Dkt. No. 18-22 at 29:15-24.) Plaintiff further claims that, "Defendant acted in an unjustified manner when it refused to issue a statement clarifying Plaintiff was not responsible for the $841,000 shortfall in the Guidance Department," and that "Defendant's failure to act to correct the false inference that Plaintiff was incompetent in her job was defamation per se." (Dkt. No. 19 at 18-19.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff's defamation claim must be dismissed because (1) her claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and (2) Plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to support her defamation claim. (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 23-26.)

A. Statute of Limitations
In South Carolina, defamation claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitation. S.C. Code § 15-3-550(1). Plaintiff claims that the statute of limitations began to run in December 2015, when she realized that Defendant would not publish a statement to correct the "false inference" regarding her role in the budgetary shortfall.20 (Dkt. No. 19 at 17-18.) As Defendant correctly notes, however, the limitations period begins to run when "the alleged defamatory statement is made, not when the plaintiff learns of the statement." See Harris v. Tietex Int'l Ltd., 417 S.C. 533, 542, 790 S.E.2d 411 (Ct. App. 2016) (noting that [*38]  South Carolina has not adopted the discovery rule in libel or slander cases); Jones v. City of Folly Beach, 326 S.C. 360, 368, 483 S.E.2d 770, 774 (Ct. App. 1997) (same). Accordingly, the limitations period began to run on November 23, 2015, when the Post & Courier published the report referencing the $841,000 of overspending by Defendant's Guidance Department. (Dkt. No. 18-4.) Plaintiff filed her defamation claim against Defendant on December 8, 2017. (Dkt. No. 1-1.) Accordingly, the undersigned agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff's defamation claim is barred by the two-year statute of limitations and must be dismissed.

B. Merits
Even if Plaintiff's defamation claim is not barred by the statute of limitations, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim still fails as a matter of law because she raises a theory of defamation that is "unknown in South Carolina," (Dkt. No. 20 at 12), and because the information in the article regarding the overspending is accurate and does not mention Plaintiff in any capacity (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 24-26). As a threshold matter, the undersigned agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff's presentation of her defamation claim is somewhat unconventional. Indeed, Plaintiff seems to base her claim on the fact that Defendant refused to issue a statement [*39]  clarifying that Plaintiff was not responsible for the overspending in the Guidance Department. (Dkt. No. 19 at 18-19.) An employer's refusal to issue a public statement at its employee's behest, however, generally does not give rise to a standard defamation claim. See McKay, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128799, 2017 WL 9250345, at *6 (listing the elements of a defamation claim). Notwithstanding this fundamental issue in Plaintiff's pleading, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff also fails to demonstrate that Defendant made a false and defamatory statement about her, or that the statements made to the Post & Courier resulted in a defamatory inference.
Plaintiff makes no contention that the information published by the Post & Courier regarding the overspending by the Guidance Department was false. (Dkt. No. 18-22 at 30:20-31:2.) Rather, Plaintiff claims that the article created the inference that Plaintiff was responsible for the overspending as Director of Guidance and Counseling Services. (Dkt. No. 19 at 18-19.) Having reviewed the article, however, the undersigned finds that any such insinuation is unreasonable. At the outset, the Post & Courier article does not name Plaintiff or even mention the Director of Guidance and Counseling Services generally. [*40]  To the contrary, the only reference to the Guidance Department is the bare statement that, "[a]mong other blown budget items, the report says the district overspent . . . $841,000 in the Guidance Department." (Dkt. No. 18-4 at 4.) As Defendant correctly notes, South Carolina courts have consistently dismissed defamation claims far stronger than that raised by Plaintiff in the instant case. (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 25.) See, e.g., Toussaint, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71775, 2017 WL 1950955, at *2 (finding no reasonable inference that plaintiff abandoned his patients despite five affidavits from plaintiff's patients drawing said inference based on memorandum "talking points" stating that plaintiff would no longer practice at Palmetto Health Neurosurgery Associates).
Moreover, viewing the article in its entirety, it appears Defendant places the blame for the District's budgetary shortfall on former Chief Financial Officer Michael Bobby, who resigned in mid-November. (Id. at 5.) See Jeter, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 196196, 2016 WL 7115912, at *10 (noting that the intent and meaning of an alleged defamatory statement must be gathered not only from the words singled out as libelous, but from the context of the entire publication). Accordingly, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has failed to raise a question of fact as to whether [*41]  the Post & Courier article created a defamatory inference regarding her involvement in the District's financial shortfall and, thus, the undersigned recommends that the Court grant Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's third and final cause of action.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the undersigned recommends that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 18) be GRANTED.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
