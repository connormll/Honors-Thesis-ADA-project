REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
BLOOM, United States Magistrate Judge:
Plaintiff, Jozef Klaper, brings this employment discrimination action against Cypress Hills Cemetery ("CHC") for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12101, et seq. ("ADA"), New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law § 290, et seq. ("NYSHRL"), and New York City Human Rights Law § 8-107, et seq. ("NYCHRL").1 Plaintiff alleges that defendants discriminated against him based on his disability and subjected him to a hostile work environment. Defendant moves for summary judgment arguing that defendant had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff: plaintiff's violation of his last chance agreement. The Honorable Nicholas G. Garaufis referred defendant's motion to me for a Report  [*2] and Recommendation in accordance with 28 U.S.C § 636(b). For the reasons set forth below, it is respectfully recommended that defendant's motion for summary judgment should be granted on plaintiff's ADA claims, and that the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff's NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff is a sixty-five-year-old man of Polish descent.2 (ECF No. 83-1, "Pl. Dep.,"  [*3] 7, 123.) Defendant, CHC, hired plaintiff on May 9, 2005, as a seasonal worker. (Pl. Dep., 23, 32; ECF No. 83-2, "Russo Dep.," 72, 75.) Plaintiff's job responsibilities included driving a tractor, mowing, completing maintenance work, and serving as a security guard. (Pl. Dep., 33-35; ECF No. 83-3, "Herron Dep.," 19.) Plaintiff became a member of the union and in May 2008, became a regular worker. (Pl. Dep., 42, 46-47; Herron Dep., 21; ECF No. 82-3, "Def.'s 56.1 Statement," ¶ 15, 26.)
Plaintiff was supervised by John Nicastro and other CHC foremen. (Pl. Dep., 41, 82; Russo Dep., 129, 131.) Plaintiff states that approximately one month after starting his job, Nicastro began calling him "Eddie Mouser," "Mouser," or "Old Mouser," referring to a deceased, former employee of CHC. (Pl. Dep., 48-49, 60.) Later, Nicastro called plaintiff "stary chuj," which is Polish for "old dick." (Id. at 63-64; ECF No. 82-3, ¶ 17; ECF No. 85-2, ¶ 17.) Plaintiff states that Nicastro harassed him in this manner "almost every day."  [*4] (Pl. Dep., 63, 66.) Defendant contests these allegations.
On June 26, 2008, plaintiff states that Nicastro started "yelling" and "bad mouthing" him for doing his leveling work improperly. (Id. at 73.) Plaintiff received an employee warning slip for poor job performance as a result of this incident, but no disciplinary action was taken against him. (Russo Dep., 122-24; ECF No. 82-19.) The next day, a Friday, plaintiff argued with Nicastro and refused to continue working with him. (Pl.'s Dep., 82.) Plaintiff went to work for another foreman after lunch. (Id.) The foreman, Carmine Deprima, told Russo that he heard plaintiff "screaming about John Nicastro and saying that he's going to kill him." (Russo Dep., 125-26, 136; ECF No. 82-21.) Later that day, a gravedigger reported that he saw plaintiff carrying a gun and saying "it was For John Nicastro." (ECF No. 82-21, Russo Dep., 137-38.) In response, CHC contacted plaintiff's union, completed an incident report, and issued plaintiff another employee warning slip. (Id. at 139-40, 144; ECF Nos. 82-20, 82-21.) Again, no disciplinary action was taken against plaintiff. (Id. at 144.)
Plaintiff states that because of his arguments with Nicastro,  [*5] he fell into a "depression," "drank a little" and "suffered from a breakdown" over the weekend. (Pl. Dep., 85.) As a result, plaintiff called the CHC office on Monday, June 30, 2008, and reported that he was ill and would return to work on Wednesday, July 2, 2008.4 (Id. at 84-86.) Plaintiff called again on Tuesday. (Id. at 87.) Plaintiff states he returned to work on Wednesday, but Russo told him to go home. (Id. at 86.) Russo states that CHC did not receive any messages from plaintiff. (Russo Dep., 151-52.) On July 2, 2008, CHC terminated plaintiff for job abandonment "[b]ecause Jozef Klaper failed to come to work on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday without notice of any kind to any members of our staff." (Russo Dep., 148-49; ECF 82-26.)
A week later, plaintiff contacted his union regarding his termination. (Pl. Dep., 91.) A union representative, Mike Herron, contacted Russo and asked for a second chance on plaintiff's behalf, stating that plaintiff had a "substance abuse problem." (Russo Dep., 160.) On July 8, 2008, a meeting was held;  [*6] plaintiff, Russo, Herron, and a Polish interpreter, Anna Kubas were present. (Pl. Dep., 95; Russo Dep., 158, 160-61.) At the meeting, plaintiff signed a last chance stipulation ("stipulation") which suspended him for three months with a "scheduled return to work date of October 1st 2008," and required him to enter and successfully complete an alcohol rehabilitation program during his suspension. (ECF No. 82-22.) Plaintiff admits that he signed the stipulation after it had been translated for him. (Pl. Dep., 98.) Plaintiff explains that he understood that he needed to return to work after three months, but did not know the exact date. (Id. at 96, 105-06.)
Plaintiff received treatment for alcoholism at St. Mark's Place Institute for Mental Health ("St. Mark's") in August 2008, and became sober. (ECF No. 85-1, Ex. 1, "Pabis Aff.," ¶¶ 7-8; ECF 85-2, Ex. 2, "Wawrzonek Aff.," ¶¶ 6-7.) Plaintiff relapsed on September 1, 2008, and voluntarily admitted himself into a detoxification program on September 4, 2008. (Pabis Aff., ¶¶ 9-10; Wawrzonek Aff., ¶¶ 8-9.) Plaintiff was released from this in-patient treatment program on the afternoon of October 1, 2008. (Pabis Aff., ¶ 11; Wawrzonek Aff., ¶  [*7] 11.)
Plaintiff failed to report for work at CHC on the morning of Wednesday, October 1, 2008. (ECF No. 85-1, Ex. 3, "Pl. Aff.," ¶ 8: Russo Dep., 175) Instead, after being released from treatment, plaintiff went to see his psychotherapist, George Wawrzonek, at St. Mark's. (Pl. Aff., ¶ 4, Wawrzonek Aff., ¶ 10.) Wawrzonek states that plaintiff was too anxious to start work. (Wawrzonek Aff., ¶ 12.) Therefore, Wawrzonek called Russo and left a voice message stating that plaintiff would be able to return to work on Monday, October 6, 2008. (Pl. Aff., ¶ 5; Wawrzonek Aff., ¶ 14.) Wawrzonek called Russo again on October 2nd and 3rd, but received no response. (Pl. Aff., ¶¶ 6-7; Wawrzonek Aff., ¶¶ 15-17.) Russo states that he did not receive any messages from Wawrzonek. (Russo Dep., 177-80; 194.) Plaintiff admits that he "did not contact anybody" at CHC after signing the stipulation until October 6, 2008. (Pl. Dep., 107.)
Plaintiff reported for work on October 6, 2008, and was told by Russo to go home. (Pl. Aff., ¶ 8; Pl. Dep., 112.) After learning that Klaper had been sent away from CHC, Dr. Pabis, the director of St. Mark's, faxed a letter to Russo urging Russo to reconsider his decision and  [*8] proposing that plaintiff could take a daily medication to prevent a relapse into alcoholism. (ECF No. 83-6.) Russo acknowledges seeing the letter from Pabis (Russo Dep., 186); nevertheless, plaintiff was officially terminated on October 9, 2008. (ECF No. 82-25; Russo Dep., 196.)
Plaintiff filed a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights (NYSDHR) on November 3, 2008, alleging wrongful termination on the basis of national origin, age, and disability. (ECF No. 83-8, 11-14.) The NYSDHR issued a final report and determination on February 22, 2010, finding no probable cause to support plaintiff's complaint. (Id. at 2-9.) Plaintiff commenced this action against his union and CHC on April 20, 2010.5 On March 21, 2012, the Court dismissed plaintiff's claims against his union, but granted plaintiff leave to amend his claims against CHC. (ECF No. 57, "Klaper I."6) Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on March 23, 2012. (ECF No. 58, "Am. Compl.") The parties conducted discovery and defendant now moves for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. (ECF Nos. 82-83.) Plaintiff opposes defendant's motion (ECF Nos. 84-85) and defendant has replied (ECF Nos. 86).

DISCUSSION

I. Standard of Review
"Summary judgment is proper only when, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, 'there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'" Doninger v. Niehoff, 642 F.3d 334, 344 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). A fact is material if it is one that "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "An issue of fact is 'genuine' if 'the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'" McCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 482 F.3d 184, 202 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248).  [*10] "The trial court's function in deciding such a motion is not to weigh the evidence or resolve issues of fact, but to decide instead whether, after resolving all ambiguities and drawing all inferences in favor of the non-moving party, a rational juror could find in favor of that party." Pinto v. Allstate Ins. Co., 221 F.3d 394, 398 (2d Cir. 2000); see also Baker v. Home Depot, 445 F.3d 541, 543 (2d Cir. 2006) (resolving all ambiguities and drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party on summary judgment).
The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing that there are no material facts in dispute and must provide "affirmative evidence" from which a jury could return a verdict in its favor. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 257. Where the movant shows a prima facie entitlement to summary judgment, "the burden shifts to the non-movant to point to record evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact." Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 273 (2d Cir. 2006). "Conclusory allegations, conjecture, and speculation . . . are insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact." Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Jones Chem., Inc., 315 F.3d 171, 175 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting Kerzer v. Kingly Mfg., 156 F.3d 396, 400 (2d Cir. 1998)).  [*11] "The 'mere existence of a scintilla of evidence' supporting the non-movant's case is also insufficient to defeat summary judgment." Id. (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252).

II. Law of the Case Doctrine
Defendant argues that Klaper I "determined key issues of fact that now have dispositive effect upon Plaintiff's case" under the law of the case doctrine. However, the Court does not decide issues of fact on a motion to dismiss or on a motion for summary judgment. Moreover, the law of the case doctrine does not apply to issues of fact, but only to decisions on issues of law. Doctor's Assocs. v. Distajo, 107 F.3d 126, 131 (2d Cir. 1997) (explaining that "[t]he doctrine of 'law of the case' instructs that if a court decides a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern in subsequent stages of the same case." (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Bristol v. Cnty. of Nassau, No 09-CV-5544 (JFB) (AKT), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2012) ("[T]he law of the case doctrine is discretionary, and applies to issues of law already decided by the Court." (emphasis added)); Am. Hotel Int'l Group Inc. v. OneBeacon Ins. Co., 611 F. Supp. 2d 373, 378 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)  [*12] ("Under the law of the case doctrine, 'a decision on an issue of law made at one stage of the litigation becomes binding precedent to be followed in subsequent stages of the same litigation'" (emphasis added) (quoting In re PCH Assoc., 949 F.2d 585, 592 (2d Cir. 1991))).
Of the "findings" cited by defendant, only one issue, highlighted in footnote 13 in Klaper I, constitutes a decision on an issue of law that is relevant to the instant motion. The Court determined in Klaper I that CHC's failure to respond to Wawrzonek's phone messages and its termination of plaintiff did not constitute a breach of the last chance agreement. Klaper I, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38651 at *31 n.13. Although the law of the case doctrine "does not preclude this Court from reconsidering issues on summary judgment," plaintiff presents no new evidence to warrant reconsideration of this issue. Nobel Ins. Co. v. City of New York, Case No. 00-CV-1329 (KMK), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70816, at *11, 13 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2006); see also McAnaney v. Astoria Fin. Corp., 665 F. Supp. 2d 132, 142 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (examining "the evidence developed during discovery, to determine whether adherence to the law of the case doctrine is warranted"). Accordingly,  [*13] the Court adheres to its determination in Klaper I that CHC did not breach the last chance agreement under the law of the case doctrine.

III. ADA7
ADA claims for employment discrimination are analyzed under the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125 (2d Cir. 2013); Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this framework, plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 49 n.3, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003); McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing Sista, 445 F.3d at 169). If plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, "[t]he burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment  [*15] action." Raytheon, 540 U.S. at 49 n.3; accord Ben-Levy v. Bloomberg, L.P., 518 F. App'x 17, 19 (2d Cir. 2013). Once defendant provides a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the burden shifts back to plaintiff to "produce evidence and carry the burden of persuasion that the proffered reason is a pretext." Sista, 445 F.3d at 169; accord Noel v. BNY-Mellon Corp., 514 F. App'x 9, 11 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 721 (2d Cir. 2002)).

A. Wrongful Termination
To establish a prima facie case of wrongful termination under the ADA,
a plaintiff must show by the preponderance of the evidence that: "(1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) that he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential job functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) he suffered adverse employment action because of his disability."
Sista, 445 F.3d at 169 (quoting Giordano v. City of New York, 274 F.3d 740, 747 (2d Cir. 2001)). CHC does not deny that it is subject to the ADA, but contends that plaintiff fails to establish the remaining elements of a prima facie case.
CHC concedes that plaintiff suffers from  [*16] alcoholism, but argues that plaintiff's alcoholism is not a disability within the meaning of the ADA. The ADA defines a disability as "(A) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities . . .; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Alcoholism is an impairment under the ADA, "[b]ut mere status as an alcoholic or substance abuser does not necessarily imply a 'limitation' under the second part of that definition." Reg'l Econ. Cmty. Action Program, Inc. v. City of Middletown, 294 F.3d 35, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2002); see also Baptista v. Hartford Bd. of Educ., No. 3:08CV1890(MRK), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62501, at *15 (D. Conn. July 20, 2009) (stating that "the Second Circuit has made clear that an individual's status as an alcoholic does not equate to a per se disability"); Pace v. Paris Maint. Co., 107 F. Supp. 2d 251, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) ("Alcoholism is not a per se disability under the ADA."). Plaintiff contends that his alcoholism is a disability within the meaning of the ADA because he has a record of alcoholism and because CHC regarded him as disabled due to his alcoholism.
To  [*17] establish a record of an impairment, plaintiff must demonstrate not only that he suffered from alcoholism, but also that his alcoholism substantially limited a major life activity. Behringer v. Lavelle Sch. for the Blind, 08 Civ. 4899 (JGK), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134440, at *25 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 17, 2010) (citing Vandenbroek v. PSEG Power CT LLC, 356 F. App'x 457, 459 n.2 (2d Cir. 2009)); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(k) (establishing that an individual has a record of a disability if he "has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities"); Nucifora v. Glass, 36 F. App'x 472, 473 (2d Cir. 2002) (stating that to establish a "record of disability," plaintiff "must still demonstrate that the alcoholism substantially limits one or more major life activities"). An impairment substantially limits a major life activity if it "prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives." Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. V. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 198, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(2)(ii)-(iii) (2001)); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)  [*18] (defining substantially limited as "unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform").
Plaintiff offers the affidavit of Dr. Pabis and his medical records from St. Mark's to establish that his alcoholism qualifies as a disability under the ADA. These documents reflect that plaintiff has a history of alcoholism that has led to the development of "dementia, amnestic disorder, depression, anxiety, auditory and visual hallucinations." (Pabis Aff., ¶ 6; ECF No. 85-1, Ex. 5, "St. Mark's Records," 13.) Dementia and amnestic disorder are "neurocognitive disorders that cause impairment of information retention or learning, impairment of long term and short term memory." (Pabis Aff. at ¶ 6.) Dr. Pabis further explains that plaintiff "exhibits decline of cognitive abilities including low abstract thinking." (Id.) Plaintiff also "hallucinates which disturbs his sleep and induces drinking to depress hallucinations." (St. Mark's Records, 17.) Both learning and sleeping are major life activities. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i) (stating that major life activities include "learning"); Sykes v. N. Fork Bank, No. 07-CV-1102 (FB) (WDW), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117311, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2009)  [*19] ("sleeping 'is undoubtedly a major life activity' under the ADA" (quoting Colwell v. Suffolk Cnty. Police Dep't, 158 F.3d 635, 643 (2d Cir. 1998)). However, "it is not enough for a plaintiff to prove than an impairment 'implicates' a major life activity—he or she must prove that it is the impairment that 'substantially limits' the activity." Bartlett v. N.Y. State Bd. of Law Exam'rs, 226 F.3d 69, 84 (2d Cir. 2000).
Plaintiff suggests that his alcoholism affects his ability to learn, but does not provide any evidence to demonstrate that the limitation is substantial. Although Dr. Pabis states generally that plaintiff suffers from neurocognitive disorders, he does not explain how these disorders have affected plaintiff's cognitive skills and memory, or how plaintiff's skills compare to the average person, or how, if at all, these disorders can be alleviated with medication or therapy. See Toyota, 534 U.S. at 198 (stating that to prove disability under the ADA, a plaintiff must offer evidence "'that the extent of the limitation [caused by their impairment] in terms of their own experience . . . is substantial.'" (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S. 555, 567, 119 S. Ct. 2162, 144 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1999)));  [*20] see also Quintero v. Rite Aid of N.Y., Inc., 09 Civ. 6084 (JLC), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130920, at *41-44 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 10, 2011) (finding that plaintiff failed to establish a disability where the "submitted evidence does not describe the duration of [plaintiff's] learning disability, its long-term impact, or the effect of any correcting or mitigating measures"). Plaintiff's own testimony provides no information regarding the effects of his alcoholism on his day-to-day ability to learn. Thus, there is insufficient record evidence to establish that plaintiff's alcoholism substantially limited his ability to learn compared to the average person in the general population.
Similarly, since "'[d]ifficulty sleeping is extremely widespread[,]' a plaintiff must show 'that his affliction is . . . worse than is suffered by a large portion of the nation's adult population.'" Young v. Precision Metal Prods., 599 F. Supp. 2d 216, 226 (D. Conn. 2009) (alteration in original) (quoting Colwell, 158 F.3d at 644); accord Sykes, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117311, at *6. The evidence submitted does not establish how frequently or significantly plaintiff's sleep is interrupted by hallucinations or if medication  [*21] alleviates his trouble sleeping.8 On the other hand, the inability to sleep due to hallucinations "goes beyond the average insomnolence that afflicts the population at large." Young, 599 F. Supp. 2d at 226. Thus, drawing all inferences in plaintiff's favor as the Court must, the Court should assume without deciding that for the purposes of defendant's motion, plaintiff has demonstrated that his alcoholism substantially limits his sleep.9 See id.
To be otherwise qualified, an individual must be "able to perform the essential functions of that job, either with or without a reasonable accommodation." Shannon v. N,Y. City Transit Auth., 332 F.3d 95, 99-100 (2d Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 361, 121 S. Ct. 955, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2001) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). Defendant argues that plaintiff was not otherwise qualified because of his absenteeism on June 30-July 2, 2008, and October 1-6, 2008. "[A]bsenteeism is sufficient to find that plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of his job." Doe v. Major Model Mgmt., Inc., 11 Civ. 6182 (KBF), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32064, at *21 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2012) (collecting cases); see also Vandenbroek v. PSEG Power Ct LLC, 356 F. App'x 457, 460 (2d Cir. 2009) (stating that plaintiff "was not 'otherwise qualified' because his employer could have concluded that he posed a risk of recurring absenteeism" (citing Teahan v. Metro-N. Commuter R.R. Co., 80 F.3d 50, 55 (2d Cir. 1996))).  [*24] Furthermore, the ADA specifically provides that an employer may hold an employee who suffers from alcoholism "to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance . . . even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the drug use or alcoholism" of the employee. 42 U.S.C. § 12114(c)(4).
However, the instant action can be distinguished from the cases cited above. In Vandenbroek, which defendant relies upon, plaintiff acknowledged that his employer had a "no call/no show" policy which required employees to call their shift supervisor prior to a shift if they were going to be absent and that he failed to abide by these procedures. CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:07-cv-869 (JCH), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18320, at *2-3, *7-8 n.2 (D. Conn. 2009), aff'd, 356 F. App'x 457 (2009). Although plaintiff, here, does not dispute being absent, he believes he complied with CHC policy for reporting an absence. Russo explains that an employee should "call the office" "[t]hat morning" to advise CHC that he will not be at work that day. (Russo Dep., 152.) Plaintiff states that he called CHC to report his absence due to illness and left a message with someone on both Monday, June 30, and  [*25] Tuesday July 1, 2008. (Pl.'s Dep., 84-85, 87.) Plaintiff further states that he reported for work on July 2, 2008, but was told by Russo to go home. (Id. at 86, 89.) Russo states CHC did not receive any message from plaintiff on those dates and that he does not recall whether plaintiff appeared for work on July 2, 2008. (Russo Dep., 151-56.) Similar factual disputes surround plaintiff's absence from work in October 2008. Plaintiff and Wawrzonek affirm that Wawrzonek called CHC in plaintiff's presence on the afternoon of October 1, 2008, and left a message for Russo stating that plaintiff needed a little more time to complete his therapy and that plaintiff would be ready to return to work on October 6, 2008. (Wawrzonek Aff.," ¶ 14; Pl.'s Aff., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff and Wawrzonek both state that Wawronzek called Russo again on October 2 and 3, 2008, and left messages; Russo did not return any of these calls. (Wawrzonek Aff., ¶ 16-17; Pl.'s Aff., ¶ 7.) Defendant, on the other hand, maintains that plaintiff "didn't return to work on the scheduled return date, failed to call and communicate to us why, he did not show us proof of successfully completing the program." (Russo Dep., 194.) These conflicting  [*26] accounts create a material issue of fact regarding plaintiff's absenteeism.
It is true that the ADA "does not require employers to tolerate chronic absenteeism even when the attendance problems are caused by an employee's disability" and the employee complies with the procedures for requesting and reporting absences. Lewis v. N.Y. City Police Dep't, 908 F. Supp. 2d 313, 327 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, this case differs from Lewis and other attendance cases because plaintiff's absences were not chronic or excessive. Plaintiff was only absent two or three days prior to being terminated in July 2008, and another three to four days prior to his termination in October 2008.10 Cf. id. at 328 (noting plaintiff's "extensive record of absences," 207 days over 17 months); Doe, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32064, at *20-21 (pointing out that plaintiff would, without warning, take leave for weeks at a time); Redman v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. Servs., 10 CV 5368 (VB), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103721, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2012) (citing plaintiff's "excessive absenteeism over the course of two years"); Robertson v. AMTRAK, 400 F. Supp. 2d 612, 614 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (noting  [*27] plaintiff's "decade-long history of absenteeism"); Teahan v. Metro-N. Commuter R.R., Co., 88 Civ. 5376 (BN), 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18448, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 27, 1994) (finding plaintiff's absenteeism "excessive" with more than 100 absences in two years), aff'd, 80 F.3d 50 (2d Cir. 1996). Therefore, based on this record, the Court should not conclude as a matter of law that plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of his job because of his absenteeism.
Turning to the next element, although plaintiff's termination in October 2008 clearly constitutes an adverse employment action, there is no record evidence that plaintiff was terminated because of his alcoholism.11 When defendant learned of plaintiff's alcoholism, CHC gave plaintiff a second chance. Instead of terminating plaintiff, CHC suspended him for three months to allow him to participate in an alcohol rehabilitation program, and agreed to pay plaintiff's benefits  [*28] during the suspension period. (ECF No. 82-22.) Although plaintiff maintains that he did not fully understand the stipulation, he admits that it was translated into Polish for him. (Pl. Dep., 98.) Furthermore, plaintiff and Mr. Wawrzonek's affidavits and phone calls reflect that, at minimum, plaintiff understood that he was required to complete the rehabilitation program and return to work on October 1, 2008. (Pl. Aff., ¶ 5, Wawrzonek Aff., ¶ 14.) It is undisputed that plaintiff did not report for work on October 1, 2008. Therefore, plaintiff was terminated because he violated the last chance agreement, not because of his alcoholism.
Moreover, "[t]erminating Plaintiff for violating the last chance agreement constitutes a legitimate, non-discriminatory justification for termination."12 Merkl v. Allied Bldg. Prods., Corp., 09-CV-03085 (DLI)(JMA), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48367, at *24 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2013) (collecting cases); see also Geromanos v. Columbia Univ., 322 F. Supp. 2d 420, 432 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) ("violation of the [return to work] agreement constituted a valid, non-discriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff"); Mayo v. Columbia Univ., 01 Civ. 2002 (LMM), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5639, at *21 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2003) ("violation of return to work agreements or Last Change Agreements constitute legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating employees" (collecting cases)). Plaintiff fails to present any evidence (or argument) that defendant's proffered reason—plaintiff's violation of the last chance stipulation—was a pretext for terminating plaintiff due to his alcoholism.13 Accordingly, it is respectfully recommended that defendant's  [*30] motion for summary judgment should be granted on plaintiff's wrongful termination claim.

B. Failure to Accommodate
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on a failure to accommodate, plaintiff must show that
(1) plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer refused to make such accommodations.
McBride, 583 F.3d at 97 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Mines v. City of New York/DHS, 11 CV 7886 (JGK), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157782, at *32 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 1, 2013). "Once the plaintiff has  [*31] demonstrated that there is a 'plausible accommodation, the costs of which facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits,' the defendant bears the burden of proving that the requested accommodation is not reasonable." McElwee v. Cnty. of Orange, 700 F.3d 635, 642 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1995)); accord Ugactz v United Parcel Serv., Inc., 10-CV-1247 (MKB), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43481, at *27 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2013). As discussed above, plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence for the Court to assume that plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of the ADA and otherwise qualified for the job. Both parties agree that defendant knew about plaintiff's disability, but CHC maintains that it never received plaintiff's requests for an accommodation on October 1-3, 2008, and in any event, plaintiff's requested accommodations were unreasonable.
"[G]enerally, it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed." See Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also McNamara v. Tourneau, Inc., 496 F. Supp. 2d 366, 376 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)  [*32] (stating that "[w]here a reasonable accommodation is needed, it is the employee's responsibility to request the accommodation"). However, a request for an accommodation is not an absolute prerequisite for finding liability for failure to accommodate under the ADA. Even when a disabled individual fails to make a request to accommodate, "an employer has a duty reasonably to accommodate an employee's disability if the disability is obvious—which is to say, if the employer knew or reasonably should have known that the employee was disabled." Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Brown v. Cnty. of Nassau, 736 F. Supp. 2d 602, 618-19 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (explaining that "it is well settled that a request for an accommodation is not required where the disabled individual's need for an accommodation is obvious"); Felix v. N.Y. Transit Auth., 154 F. Supp. 2d 640, 657 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (stating that "when an employer has independent knowledge of an employee's disability[,] [t]he rule requiring a request for accommodation can be ignored").
CHC argues that it made reasonable accommodations for plaintiff as required by the ADA when it entered into the stipulation and  [*33] gave plaintiff the opportunity to return to work on October 1, 2008, after successfully completing a rehabilitation program. The Court agrees. Although the ADA mandates that an employer make reasonable accommodations, an employer "does not have to provide a disabled individual with every accommodation he requests or the accommodation of his choice." McElwee, 700 F.3d at 641; accord Reeve v Murabito, 5:13-cv-712, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163359, *7 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2013); see also Trobia v. Hernderson, 315 F. Supp. 2d 322, 333 (W.D.N.Y. 2004) (stating that "the Act 'does not require the employer to provide every accommodation the disabled employee may request, so long as the accommodation provided is reasonable.'" (quoting Fink v. N.Y. City Dep't of Pers., 53 F.3d 565, 567 (2d Cir. 1995))).
Here, defendant reasonably accommodated plaintiff; CHC allowed plaintiff to take three months leave to attend the rehabilitation program and permitted plaintiff to return to work on the condition that he provide proof of successful completion of the rehabilitation program. Defendant was not required, as a matter of law, to provide any further accommodation. See Merkl, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48367, at *23-24  [*34] (finding that defendants reasonably accommodated plaintiff by permitting plaintiff to take "paid leave to attend a rehabilitation program" and allowing plaintiff "to return to work while completing the rehabilitation program on the condition he agree to undergo frequent alcohol testing").
Moreover, it is uncontested that plaintiff failed to report for work on October 1, 2008. Wawrzonek only called CHC on the afternoon of October 1, 2008,14 and Dr. Pabis only sent CHC the fax on October 6, 2008. (Wawrzonek Aff., ¶ 11, 14; Pabis Aff., ¶ 19.) By the time of these requests, plaintiff had already violated the stipulation. "A requested accommodation that simply excuses past misconduct is unreasonable as a matter of law," even when the misconduct is related to a disability.15 McElwee, 700 F.3d at 641 (collecting cases); see also U.S. Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n, Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, question 36 (2002) ("Since reasonable accommodation is always prospective, an employer is not required to excuse past misconduct even if it is the result of the individual's disability."); Woolcott v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours & Co., 95-CV-0721E(F), 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6700, at *20 (W.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 1997) [*35]  ("Asking for a second chance and to be absolved of one's past misconduct is not a request for an accommodation."). Accordingly, it is respectfully recommended that defendant's motion for summary judgment should be granted on plaintiff's ADA claims regarding defendant's failure to accommodate.

IV. State & City Human Rights Law Claims
Both NYSHRL and NYCHRL have an election of remedies provision that bars suit in federal court if plaintiff has previously filed an NYSDHR complaint. See N.Y. Exec. Law § 297(9);  [*36] N.Y. City Admin. Code § 8-502(a); see also York v. Ass'n of the Bar, 286 F.3d 122, 127 (2d Cir. 2002) (stating that under NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims "once brought before the NYSHDR, may not be brought again as a plenary action in another court"). The election of remedies bar is "jurisdictional." Moodie v. Fed. Reserve Bank, 58 F.3d 879, 884 (2d Cir. 1995); accord Williams v. City of New York, 916 F. Supp. 2d 517, 521 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). "[C]ourts interpret the scope of claims precluded by the election of remedies broadly;" plaintiff must allege "a different set of facts" from those alleged in his NYSHDR complaint, to obtain review in this Court. Jackson v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 709 F. Supp. 2d 218, 225 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); Higgins v. NYP Holdings, Inc., 836 F. Supp. 2d 182, 189 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (noting that plaintiff's claims are barred under the election of remedies doctrine if "they are based on the same operative events he presented to the SDHR").16
Plaintiff argues that his NYSDHR complaint does not preclude his instant hostile work environment claim because his NYSDHR complaint only alleged facts regarding his wrongful termination, not facts regarding a hostile work environment. Although plaintiff lists national origin, and age along with disability as the basis for his NYSDHR complaint, plaintiff's NYSDHR complaint does not contain any allegations regarding Nicastro or the ongoing harassment he experienced on the basis of his national origin and age.17 (NYSDHR Compl. 2-3.) The NYSDHR complaint only refers to a single discrete act of discrimination, plaintiff's termination after CHC learned of his treatment for alcoholism. (Id. at 3.) Based on these allegations, the NYSDHR "could not reasonably have been expected  [*38] to investigate a claim of hostile work environment when no such claim was made or implied." Sims v. City of New York, 08 Civ. 5965 (JGK), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103536, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2010); see also Morales v. Long Island R.R. Co., 09 CV 8714 (HB), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47926, at *12-13 (S.D.N.Y. May 14, 2010) (finding that "it is difficult to see how the EEOC would have been on notice of a hostile work environment" when "Plaintiff's EEOC complaint alleges a single discrete act of discrimination without any reference to continuing activity"). Therefore, the Court should not apply the election of remedies doctrine to bar plaintiff's instant hostile work environment claim brought under NYSHRL and NYCHRL.
Nonetheless, as I have recommended that the federal law claims in this action should be dismissed, the Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiff's state and city law claims. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) ("The district courts  [*39] may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim . . . if . . . the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction."); see also N.Y. Mercantile Exch., Inc. v. IntercontinentalExchange Inc., 497 F.3d 109, 119 (2d Cir. 2007)("'In general, where the federal claims are dismissed before trial, the state claims should be dismissed as well.'" (quoting Marcus v. AT&T Corp., 138 F.3d 46, 57 (2d Cir. 1998))). "Since [N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 205] allow[s] a plaintiff to recommence a dismissed suit within six months without regard to the statute of limitations, plaintiff[] will not be prejudiced by the dismissal of [his] SHRL and CHRL claim." Tishman v. Associated Press, 05 Civ. 4278 (GEL), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85588, at *29 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Souhaite v. Cnty. of Nassau, CV 12-2698 (SJF)(ETB), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118101, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. May 9, 2013); see also Charlotten v. Heid, 1:09-cv-0891 (LEK/RFT), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86060, at *47 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2011) (declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction where plaintiff could re-file his claim in state court).
Furthermore, the parties would not need  [*40] to repeat discovery if plaintiff chooses to pursue his hostile work environment claims in state court. See Kelsey v. City of N.Y., No 03-CV-5978 (JFB) (KAM), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91977, at *36 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2006) (declining supplemental jurisdiction since discovery would not need to be repeated if plaintiff litigated the claim in state court). Thus, it is respectfully recommended that the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff's NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims. Fraticelli v. Good Samaritan Hosp., 11 CV 3376 (VB), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43542, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2013) (declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff's NYSHRL claim after dismissing plaintiff's federal claims); Karmel v. Liz Claiborne, Inc., 99 Civ. 3608 (WK), 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12842, at *10-11 (S.D.N.Y. July 12, 2002) (declining supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff's NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims).

CONCLUSION
Accordingly, it is respectfully recommended that defendant's motion for summary judgment should be granted on plaintiff's federal claims. It is further recommended that the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff's NYSHRL and  [*41] NYCHRL claims.

FILING OF OBJECTIONS TO THIS REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Rule 72(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the parties shall have fourteen (14) days from service of this Report to file written objections.
