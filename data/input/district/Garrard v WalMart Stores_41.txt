Opinion



ORDER
THIS CAUSE comes before the Court on Defendants Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, Shelley Allman, Ernest Smith, Vanessa Smith and Kenneth Ellis' Dispositive Motion for Summary Judgment with Incorporated Memorandum of Law in Support (Dkt. 30), Statement of Undisputed Facts (Dkt. 31) and supporting exhibits (Dkt. 32) and Plaintiff James Garrard's Memorandum in Opposition (Dkt. 34), Statement of Disputed Facts (Dkt. 35), and supporting deposition (Dkt. 36). Also before the Court is the parties' subsequently filed Joint Stipulation for Dismissal [*2]  of Individual Defendants Only With Prejudice (Dkt. 33). Given that the parties now agree to the dismissal of the individual Defendants from this action, those individual Defendants will be dismissed from this action with prejudice and with each of the parties' bearing their own attorneys' fees and costs, leaving pending only Plaintiff's claims against Defendant Wal-mart Stores, Inc and Wal-Mart Stores East, LP.
In those pending claims, James Garrard ("Plaintiff" or "Garrard"), a current co-manager for Defendants Wal-mart Stores, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores East, LP (collectively "Defendants"), alleges that Defendants discriminated and retaliated against him in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq. (the "FMLA"), the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (the "ADAAA"), and the Florida Civil Rights Act, Fla. Stat. § 760.01, et seq. (the "FCRA"). Specifically, he alleges that Defendants failed to restore him to his previous position as store manager and demoted him to a co-manager position while he was on FMLA leave (Counts I and II) (Dkt. 19, Amended Complaint. ¶¶ 49-52, 56-57, 59). He also alleges that Defendants denied him a reasonable accommodation for his disability (chronic depression [*3]  and acute adjustment disorder accompanied by severe anxiety), and demoted and transferred him in retaliation for his request for a reasonable accommodation for his disability (Counts III-VI). (Id. at ¶¶ 14, 66-68, 72, 80-82, 86).
Defendants move for final summary judgment on the claims on grounds that: (1) Plaintiff was not entitled to job restoration under the FMLA because he voluntarily requested to "step down" as store manager; (2) there is no causal connection between Plaintiff's FMLA leave request and his demotion to co-manager because he voluntarily requested to "step down" as store manager; (3) Plaintiff's ADAAA and FCRA discrimination claims fail as a matter of law because Defendants granted Plaintiff's sole accommodation request; and (4) Defendants had a legitimate, non-discriminatory, and non-retaliatory reason for Plaintiff's demotion, and he cannot establish that this reason is false and that the real reason was his FMLA leave request or disability.
Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining for trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine [*4]  issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citation omitted). On a motion for summary judgment, the court must review the record, and all its inferences, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962). Having done so, the Court must find that there are no genuine issues of fact remaining for trial and that Defendants are entitled to the entry of final summary judgment in their favor. Defendants' sole basis for demoting Plaintiff and not allowing him to return as store manager is that Plaintiff voluntarily requested in an email to step down as store manager. Defendants argue in the instant Motion that the subject email is to be construed as an unequivocal notice of intent by Plaintiff to step down into the demoted position of co-manager and, after carefully reviewing the evidence of record in this case, the Court must agree.
Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff was eligible for and qualified for FMLA leave in March 2015, nor is it disputed that Defendants approved Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave from March 10 through June 10, 2015. (Dkt. 32, Exhibit 1, Garrard Deposition, 85:17-24, 86:1-4, 14-25, 87:1-7, 10-23, 99:16-20, Garrard Deposition Exs. 15, 18). Under the FMLA, it is unlawful for an employer [*5]  to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of an employee's rights under the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). The FMLA also makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by the FMLA. Id. § 2615(a)(2). Employees may bring two types of claims when suing under the FMLA: "interference claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act . . ., and retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act." Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted). Plaintiff seeks to recover under both type of claims.
Plaintiff claims that Defendants interfered with his FMLA rights and retaliated against him for taking FMLA leave because they failed to restore him to his previous position as store manager and demoted him to a co-manager position while he was on FMLA leave (Counts I and II of the Amended Complaint). (Dkt. 19, Amended Compl., ¶¶ 49-52, 56-57, 59). In his deposition, he reaffirmed this as the basis of both his interference and retaliation claims. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, [*6]  118:23-25, 119:1-25, 120:1-2). Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot prevail under either theory because he unequivocally requested to "step down" as store manager and requested the demotion to co-manager and Defendants simply honored Garrard's requests.
To establish his claim that Defendants interfered with his FMLA protected substantive rights, Plaintiff has the burden of proving he was entitled to a benefit under the FMLA that Defendants allegedly denied him. Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207. Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee is generally entitled to be restored to the position the employee held when the leave began or to an equivalent position. 29 C.F.R. § 825.214. However, "if an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not to return to work, the employer's obligation[]under FLMA . . . to restore the employee cease[s]." 29 C.F.R. § 825.311(b). The evidence in this case does in fact show unequivocally that Plaintiff requested in writing to "step down" as store manager and requested the demotion to co-manager.
On March 10, 2015, Plaintiff was scheduled to work from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 62:21-25, 63:1-2). He showed up for work at 7:00 a.m., but left to attend a doctor's appointment at 10:00 a.m. (Id. at [*7]  64:16-20). He did not return to work after his doctor's appointment, but left a voice message for Defendants' Market Human Resource Manager, Kenneth Ellis ("Ellis"), notifying him that his doctor had put him on an immediate leave of absence. (Id. at 64:17-25, 65:1-5). According to Plaintiff, he then advised Ellis that "the doctor was not letting him come back to work" and he inquired, "[I]f I'm off for a while, what would that look like, if I decide because of health reasons and if I'm going to be gone, for the good of the store, what [would] it look like if I decide to step back." (Id. at 71:11-13, 19-22). Ellis responded that he did not know, but would get back to him. (Id. at 71:23-25). Plaintiff also claims that he and Ellis discussed FMLA leave and he told Ellis that he could either e-mail the FMLA paperwork to him or his wife would pick it up at the store. (Id. at 73:15-25, 74:1). Ellis has a similar recollection of the conversation, and he testified that Plaintiff told him that "the doctor advised him to take some time off" and that he "needed to take a step back." (Dkt. 32, Ex. 2, Ellis Deposition, 14:8-15, 15:4-13, 26:5-25, 27:1-19).
On March 12, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a [*8]  doctor's note to Defendants, which states, in part, "[p]lease excuse James Garrard from work March 10 to March 17, 2015 because of illness." (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 73:9-14, 74:2-7, 13-17; Garrard Deposition Ex. 10; Ex. 2, Ellis Deposition, 27:23-25, 28:6-25). On March 14, 2015, Ellis sent Plaintiff a text message at 8:41 a.m., which stated as follows:
Jim, I had conversations with leaders, shift manager position[5] will be available in the area for at his [sic] time. Please email request prior to Monday. Please fill out as much as you can for LOA then submit to my fax number 941.745.1423. This is time sensitive[.]
(Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 72:21-25, 73:1-6, 74:20-25, 75:1-18; Garrard Deposition Ex.11).
In response, on March 14, 2015, Plaintiff sent Ellis an e-mail with the unambiguous subject line "Request for Shift Manager Position" and the body of the e-mail stating, in part, "Ken, [p]er our conversation earlier this week I am interested/requesting to step down from store manager at this time. As I just received your message I would like to know the logistics surrounding the shift manager position you spoke of." (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 76:18-25, [*9]  77:1-12, Garrard Deposition Ex. 12). Ellis responded to Plaintiff's e-mail at 9:05 a.m., advising that he would provide possible locations on Monday and asked Plaintiff to provide his preferred areas. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 79:4-16; Garrard Deposition Ex. 13). Plaintiff responded at 9:53 a.m., stating, "[p]referred would be north part of Market 118 and/or southern part of Market 115. If there are co-manager positions in Neighborhood Markets I would consider that as well." (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 79:17-25, 80:1-2; Garrard Deposition Ex. 13).
On March 16, 2015, Ellis notified Plaintiff that his demotion request had been accepted and approved by Defendants' leadership and that it had been announced at Store #1874 that he would not be returning as store manager. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 80:5-25, 81:1-12; Garrard Deposition Exhibit 14). Plaintiff admits that Defendants' Market Assistant, Lisa Hoffius ("Hoffius"), then called him sometime later in March or April to complete the job offer for the co-manager position at Store #5264, and that during the conversation, she read the job offer to him, he told her "Okay. Let's do the job offer then," and he [*10]  gave her his password to complete the job offer. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 91:2-3, 92:5-16, 19-25, 93:1-25, 94:1-6; Garrard Deposition Ex. 19; Ex. 2, Ellis Deposition, 40:8-24).
Plaintiff urges that his communications were not actually intended as a request to step down, but rather to state that he was "interested" and looking into stepping back, not knowing where he was going with his health and not knowing how long he was going to be out. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 78:1-11). He asserts that the "requesting" language in his email was something Ellis said he had to have in writing so Plaintiff typed the email using the word "requesting" advised by Ellis. (Id. at 78:1-13). Nevertheless, Plaintiff fails to present evidence of any follow up communications with Ellis or Hoffius wherein he alerted them of their misunderstanding of his communications about the step down and demotion or wherein he attempted to clarify his intentions. When Ellis was asked in his deposition how he interpreted the statement in Plaintiff's email where he stated "interested/requesting," Ellis stated that it was his understanding that it meant "[h]e is interested in the store manager position [*11]  and requesting to step down from a store manager." (Dkt. 32, Ex. 2, Ellis Deposition, 51:6-25). In light of all Plaintiff's requests, actions and omissions, as set out above and demonstrated by the record evidence in this case, it is clear that Plaintiff gave "unequivocal notice of [his] intent not to return to work" as a store manager.
On May 28, 2015, Plaintiff sent an e-mail to Defendants' Senior Human Resources Director, Vanessa Smith, claiming that he agreed to "step down" as store manager, but that after much consideration, he was ready to return to the store manager position at Store #1874 on June 5th -- the date his doctor had cleared him to return to work. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 95:9-25, 96:1-2, 98:2-11; Garrard Deposition Ex. 20). Ultimately, on June 11, 2015, Defendants' Regional Human Resources Director, Ernest Smith ("E. Smith"), advised Plaintiff that the store manager position at Store #1874 had been filled using the proper selection after Plaintiff requested a demotion to a co-manager position and, therefore, Plaintiff would not be reinstated to the store manager position. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 110:12-24, 111:4-7, Garrard Deposition Ex. 25; [*12]  Ex. 3, E. Smith Deposition, 17:1-14). Defendants had no obligation to restore him to the store manager position when he returned from FMLA leave due to Plaintiff's unequivocal requests and actions for a step down from store manager and a demotion to co-manager.
Turning to Plaintiff's retaliation claim, Plaintiff must prove three elements to prevail on this claim: (1) engagement in a statutorily protected conduct; (2) an adverse employment decision; and (3) a causal connection between the conduct and the adverse employment decision. Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1307 (11th Cir. 2006). As discussed above, there was a request for a leave of absence under FMLA and an adverse employment decision in this case. The request for the leave of absence occurred on March 10, 2015, and Defendants initiated the process of demoting Plaintiff on March 14, 2015. To establish a causal connection, a plaintiff must show, that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated. See Gupta v. Florida Board of Regents, 212 F.3d 571, 590 (11th Cir. 2000). For purposes of a prima facie case, "close temporal proximity" may be sufficient. Id. Here, only a period of four days lapsed between March 10, 2015 and March 14, 2015.
As one court has recognized, the Eleventh Circuit has found that the pleading burden with [*13]  the respect to the causal link is minimal. Ayubo v. City of Edgewater, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3119, 2009 WL 113381, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 16, 2009). Because Plaintiff does not present any direct evidence to support his FMLA retaliation claim, the Court must evaluate the claim by applying the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms, Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 (11th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, Plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that: (1) he engaged in statutorily protected conduct; (2) he was adversely affected by an employment decision; and (3) there was a causal connection between the statutorily protected conduct and the adverse employment decision. Drago, 453 F.3d at 1307; Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207; Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798. Further, as mandated by the Supreme Court, Plaintiff bears the burden of proving that his FMLA leave request was the "but for" cause for Defendants' failure to restore him to the store manager position and his demotion to a co-manager position. Univ. of Texas Southwestern Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2525, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013).
This Court has already determined that Plaintiff requested to "step down" as store manager and requested the demotion to co-manager and that Defendants honored his requests. Had Plaintiff not requested to "step down" from store manager to co-manager, Defendants would have allowed him to return as store manager at Store #1874 after his FMLA leave ended in June 2015. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 2, Ellis Deposition, [*14]  68:22-25, 69:1). There is no basis in the evidence for this Court to find otherwise. Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot establish the necessary causal connection between his request for FMLA leave, which Defendants approved, and his demotion. Moreover, Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendants' failure to allow him to rescind his demotion request was an adverse employment action. See MacLean v. City of St. Petersburg, 194 F. Supp. 2d 1290, 1303 (M.D. Fla. 2002) (holding that after an employee had voluntarily resigned, the employer had complete discretion as to whether to accept the resignation or allow her to rescind it).
With respect to Plaintiff's employment discrimination claim, in order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADAAA and the FCRA,1 he must show that he: (1) has a disability; (2) is qualified with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (3) was unlawfully discriminated against because of the disability. Rossbach v. City of Miami, 371 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (11th Cir. 2004). Plaintiff may establish the third prong of the prima facie case of disability discrimination by proving that Defendants failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation for his disability. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). "[A plaintiff] bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform [*15]  the job's essential functions." Id. at 1255-56. Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants denied him a reasonable accommodation for his disability (chronic depression and acute adjustment disorder accompanied by severe anxiety), and demoted and transferred him in retaliation for his request for a reasonable accommodation for his disability5 (Counts III-VI). (Dkt. 19, Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 14, 66-68, 72, 80-82, 86). The only accommodation that Plaintiff requested, however, was FMLA leave from March 10 through June 10, 2015, which Defendants granted. Plaintiff admits that he did not request any other leaves of absence or other type of accommodation. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 99:16-25; 100:3-23). Therefore, as Defendants correctly argue, the ADAAA and FCRA discrimination claims must fail as a matter of law. "An employee's failure to request a reasonable accommodation is fatal to the prima facie case; 'the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made.'" Warren v. Volusia Cnty., 188 F. App'x 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999)).
Plaintiff argues that Defendants failed to participate in the required interactive process regarding Garrard's requested accommodation of a leave of absence [*16]  ("LOA") under the ADAAA and FCRA and used his mental impairment of depression and anxiety to take advantage of him in bad faith while he was only three days into his LOA under FMLA; however, the Eleventh Circuit has specifically rejected the theory that an employer could be held liable under the ADA for failing to engage in an interactive process with an employee when an employee merely identifies a disability. Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997). The Eleventh Circuit clarified, in Willis, that an employer does not have a duty to engage in the interactive process until the employee requests an accommodation. Id.; see also Warren, 188 F. App'x at 862 n.3 (noting that "[a]n employer's duty to engage in an interactive process does not trigger until the employee has identified and requested [an] accommodation").
Finally, even if Plaintiff was able establish to a prima facie case of either discrimination or retaliation, the evidence of record in this case demonstrates that Defendants had a legitimate, non-discriminatory, and non-retaliatory reason for Plaintiff's demotion. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802 (holding that once the complainant carries his initial burden, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment [*17]  action). Defendants' burden in this regard is "exceedingly light." Meeks v. Computer Assocs., Int'l, 15 F.3d 1013, 1021 (11th Cir. 1994). As this Court determined, it is undisputed that Plaintiff sent Ellis an e-mail on March 14 requesting to "step down" as store manager and requesting a co-manager position. (Dkt. 32, Ex. 1, Garrard Deposition, 76:18-25, 77:1-12, Garrard Deposition Ex. 12). Furthermore, it is undisputed that Defendants did not allow Plaintiff to rescind his demotion request because he had voluntarily initiated the request, and as a result, Defendants underwent through the process of interviewing, selecting, and hiring another store manager to replace him. The performance and conditions of Store #1874 that necessitated the March 10th meeting, which Plaintiff did not attend, also factored into Defendants' decision. (Ex. 32, Dkt. 3, E. Smith Deposition, 18:12-25, 19:3-17, 22-25, 20:16-24; Garrard Deposition Ex. 25).
Because Defendants meet their burden, the burden then returns to Plaintiff to prove by significantly probative evidence that Defendants' proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination and retaliation. Carter v. Miami, 870 F.2d 578, 584 (11th Cir. 1989) (citation omitted) (holding that once a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for dismissal is put forward by the employer, [*18]  the burden returns to the plaintiff to prove by significantly probative evidence that the proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination). Plaintiff must prove both that the reason is false and that discrimination and/or retaliation was the real reason. St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993). The Supreme Court has ruled that a plaintiff must not only show that the defendant's stated reason is false, but he must also show that discrimination and/or retaliation was the "but-for" cause of Defendants' alleged adverse action against him. University of Texas Southwestern Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2533, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013). Conclusory allegations are insufficient. Azoy v. Miami-Dade Cnty., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25048, 2003 WL 22135963, at *7 (S.D. Fla. June 10, 2003).
Here, Plaintiff fails to offer any credible evidence at all, much less "significantly probative" evidence, to call into question that Defendants had a legitimate, non-discriminatory, and non-retaliatory reason for Plaintiff's demotion. It "is not for the courts to second-guess as a kind of superpersonnel department." EEOC v. Total Sys. Servs., 221 F.3d 1171, 1176 (11th Cir. 2000). "We have repeatedly and emphatically held that a defendant may terminate an employee for a good or bad reason without violating federal law. We are not in the business of adjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair. Instead, our sole concern is whether unlawful discriminatory animus motivates a challenged employment [*19]  decision." Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir. 1999) (internal citations omitted); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1247 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Damon).
ACCORDINGLY, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED:
1. This action is dismissed with prejudice as to the individual Defendants Shelley Allman, Ernest Smith, Vanessa Smith and Kenneth Ellis, with each party to bear its own attorneys' fees and costs.
2. Defendants' Dispositive Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 30) is GRANTED. The Clerk is directed to enter final judgment in favor of Defendants Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores East, LP and against Plaintiff, and to close this case.
DONE AND ORDERED at Tampa, Florida, on November 7, 2016.
