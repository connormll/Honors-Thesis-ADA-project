Opinion



ORDER
Pending before the Court is Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Document No. 31) and Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Document No. 32). Having considered the motions, submissions, and applicable law, the Court determines Defendants' motion should be granted and Plaintiff's motion should be denied.

I. BACKGROUND
This is an employment dispute between Plaintiff Derrick [*2]  White ("White") and White's alleged former employers, Defendants Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. ("DODI") and Diamond Offshore Management Company ("DOMC") (collectively, "Defendants").1 On April 19, 2015, while allegedly employed by Defendants as an offshore driller, White suffered a head injury resulting from a non-work-related ATV accident. Following the April 19, 2015 accident, White requested and was granted leave from work. On July 15, 2015, White's employment was terminated. White alleges his termination was based on the injuries White sustained in the April 19, 2015 accident and White's subsequent taking of leave. Defendants allege White was terminated because he failed to submit documents substantiating his medical leave or releasing him to return to work.
Based on White's allegations, on October 25, 2016, White filed this lawsuit in the 152nd District Court of Harris County, Texas against DODI, asserting claims of (1) disability discrimination and retaliation pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act as Amended (the "ADAAA") and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act of 1983 (the "TCHRA"); and (2) interference and retaliation pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act (the "FMLA"). On November 22, 2016, White amended his state court petition [*3]  to add DOMC as a defendant. On December 12, 2016, Defendants removed the case to this Court. On January 31, 2018, Defendants moved for summary judgment on all of White's claims. The same day, White cross-moved for summary judgment on White's FMLA interference claim.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is proper when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmovant. Coleman v. Hous. Indep. Sch. Dist., 113 F.3d 528, 533 (5th Cir. 1997). Initially, the movant bears the burden of presenting the basis for the motion and the elements of the causes of action upon which the nonmovant will be unable to establish a genuine dispute of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). The burden then shifts to the nonmovant to come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine dispute for trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986). "A dispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Bodenheimer v. PPG Indus., Inc., 5 F.3d 955, 956 (5th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted).
But the nonmoving party's bare allegations, standing alone, are insufficient to create a material dispute of fact and defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). Moreover, conclusory allegations [*4]  unsupported by specific facts will not prevent an award of summary judgment; the plaintiff cannot rest on his allegations to get to a jury without any significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint. Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Emps. v. City Pub. Serv. Bd. of San Antonio, 40 F.3d 698, 713 (5th Cir. 1994). If a reasonable jury could not return a verdict for the nonmoving party, then summary judgment is appropriate. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 248. The nonmovant's burden cannot be satisfied by "conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or 'only a scintilla of evidence.'" Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., 476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994)). Furthermore, it is not the function of the court to search the record on the nonmovant's behalf for evidence which may raise a fact issue. Topalian v. Ehrman, 954 F.2d 1125, 1137 n.30 (5th Cir. 1992). Therefore, "[a]lthough we consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the nonmoving party may not rest on the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings, but must respond by setting forth specific facts indicating a genuine issue for trial." Goodson v. City of Corpus Christi, 202 F.3d 730, 735 (5th Cir. 2000).

III. LAW & ANALYSIS
White brings claims against Defendants for (1) disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation pursuant to the ADAAA and TCHRA; and (2) interference and retaliation pursuant to the FMLA. Defendants move for summary judgment [*5]  on all of White's claims. White cross-moves for summary judgment on White's FMLA interference claim only. The Court addresses each of White's claims in turn.

A. Disability Discrimination
White contends Defendants violated the ADAAA and TCHRA because White's alleged disability was a motivating factor in Defendants' decision to terminate White. Defendants contend White can neither establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination nor establish Defendants' asserted reasons for White's termination are pretextual.
The disability discrimination analysis is the same under the ADAAA and TCHRA. Rodriquez v. ConAgra Grocery Prods. Co., 436 F.3d 468, 474 (5th Cir. 2006). To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must show "(1) that she has a disability; (2) that she was qualified for the job; [and] (3) that she was subjected to an adverse employment decision on account of her disability." E.E.O.C. v. LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 697 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting Zenor v. El Paso Healthcare Sys., Ltd., 176 F.3d 847, 853 (5th Cir. 1999)). If the plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie showing of discrimination, a presumption of discrimination arises, and an employer must "articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the adverse employment action. Id. at 694. The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show the articulated reason is pretextual. Id.
Defendants do not [*6]  dispute White was qualified for his position. Defendants contend White cannot establish (1) White was disabled; and (2) White was subjected to an adverse employment decision because of a disability. "As a threshold requirement in an ADA claim, the plaintiff must, of course, establish that he has a disability." Rogers v. Int'l Marine Terminals, 87 F.3d 755, 758 (5th Cir. 1996). "[T]he relevant time for assessing the existence of a disability is the time of the adverse employment action." E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d 606, 618 (5th Cir. 2009). The ADAAA defines "disability" as a "physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual."2 42 U.S.C. § 12102(s). The relevant inquiry is therefore whether White suffered from a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited one or more of his major life activities at the time he was terminated.3
White was terminated on July 15, 2015. Although it is undisputed that White suffered a head injury on April 19, 2015, White's amended state court petition—the live pleading—does not describe how White was physically or mentally impaired at the time White was terminated. To the contrary, White's amended petition states that "[o]n or about June 26, 2015, White was cleared to return to work by his neurologist . . [*7]  . ."4 White has not sought leave to amend his petition, and the deadline to do so has long passed.5 Nor does White's response to Defendants' summary judgment motion specifically describe White's impairment or point to evidence indicating impairment at the time of White's termination. During White's deposition, White stated he could not describe what physical limitations he had as of May 15, 2015.6 White also stated that he did not have an ongoing medical condition, disease, or need for medication resulting from the April 19, 2015 accident.7
White contends only that he was disabled because he had not been released by his doctors to return to work following the April 19, 2015 accident.8 The Court first notes this contradicts the allegations in White's live pleadings. Turning to the evidence, on May 27, 2015, White's trauma doctor released White to work pending clearance from White's neurosurgeon.9 On July 15, 2015, the day of White's termination, White's neurosurgeon certified that White had last been treated on July 1, 2015, had no [*8]  psychiatric or cognitive impairment, and had recovered.10 Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to White, although White was not released from neurosurgery until July 15, 2015, the evidence indicates that at least as of July 1, 2015, White did not suffer from impairment.
Further, regardless of whether White was released when terminated, White still fails to provide evidence of impairment. See Griffin v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 661 F.3d 216, 223 (5th Cir. 2011) ("Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has recognized the concept of per se disability under the ADA, no matter how serious the impairment; the plaintiff still must adduce evidence of an impairment that has actually and substantially limited the major life activity on which he relies."); see also Rogers, 87 F.3d at 758-59 (holding plaintiff failed to establish a disability despite not being released by plaintiff's doctors). White therefore fails to establish he was disabled at the time his employment was terminated. Also, even assuming White was disabled, White fails to adduce evidence that he was terminated on account of his disability or that his disability was a motivating [*9]  factor in his termination. Thus, White has not established a prima facie case of disability discrimination, and the Court need not address whether Defendants' articulated reasons for White's termination are pretextual. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted as to White's ADAAA and TCHRA disability discrimination claims.

B. Failure to Accommodate
White contends Defendants violated the ADAAA and TCHRA because Defendants failed to accommodate White's alleged disability or engage in the interactive process. Defendants contend White cannot establish a prime facie failure to accommodate case.
The failure to accommodate analysis is the same under the ADAAA and TCHRA. Rodriquez, 436 F.3d at 474. To establish a prima facie failure to accommodate claim, a plaintiff must show "(1) the plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) the disability and its consequential limitations were known by the covered employer; and (3) the employer failed to make reasonable accommodations for such known limitations." Neely, 735 F.3d at 247.
As a threshold matter, White's failure to accommodate claim fails because, as discussed supra Part III.A., White has not established he was disabled at the time of his termination. However, [*10]  Defendants alternatively contend that, even if disabled, White fails to show he is a "qualified individual with a disability" because (1) White could not return to work; and (2) White did not request a reasonable accommodation. The ADA defines "a qualified individual with a disability" as "an individual who, with or without accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "[A]n essential element of any job is an ability to appear for work . . . ." Rogers, 87 F.3d at 759 (quoting Carr v. Reno, 23 F.3d 525, 530 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).
It is undisputed that at the time of White's termination, he was unable to return to work. Further, the only accommodation White sought was additional leave for an unspecified amount of time, which is not a sufficient request for accommodation. See id. ("Reasonable accommodation does not require an employer to wait indefinitely for the employee's medical conditions to be corrected." (quoting Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir 1995))); see also Acker v. Gen. Motors, L.L.C., 853 F.3d 784, 791-92 (5th Cir. 2017) (holding that a request for "FMLA leave alone is not a request for an ADA reasonable accommodation."). White therefore fails to show he was a qualified individual with a disability.11 Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted as to White's [*11]  ADAAA and TCHRA failure to accommodate claims.

C. ADAAA and TCHRA Retaliation
White contends Defendants retaliated against him by terminating White because of his alleged request for additional leave. Defendants contend White can neither establish a prima facie case of ADA or TCHRA retaliation nor establish Defendants' asserted reasons for White's termination are pretextual.
To establish a prima facie case of ADAAA or TCHRA retaliation, a plaintiff must show (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Seaman v. CSPH, Inc., 179 F.3d 297, 301 (5th Cir. 1999). As with a discrimination claim, if the plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie showing of retaliation, the burden shifts to the employer to advance a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the employer's adverse action. Id. "If such a reason is advanced, the employee must show that but for the protected activity, the adverse employment action would not have occurred." Id.
Defendants contend White's request for additional leave was not protected activity under the ADAAA or the TCHRA. As discussed supra Part III.B., White's request for [*12]  additional leave was not a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADAAA or TCHRA. White therefore cannot establish he engaged in protected activity. See Hartman v. Lafourche Parish Hosp., 262 F. Supp. 3d 391, 400-01 (E.D. La. 2017) (Milazzo, J.) (dismissing ADA retaliation claim because plaintiff did not engage in activity protected by the ADA in requesting leave as a reasonable accommodation).12 Thus, White fails to establish a retaliation claim under the ADAAA or TCHRA, and the Court need not address whether Defendants' articulated reasons for White's termination are pretextual. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted as to White's ADAAA and TCHRA retaliation claims.

D. Interference
White contends Defendants interfered with White's exercise of his FMLA rights by failing to provide White with twelve weeks of leave.13 Defendants contend White cannot establish a prima facie case of FMLA interference.
To establish a prima facie case of FMLA interference, a plaintiff must show (1) he was an eligible employee; (2) his employer was subject to FMLA requirements; (3) he was entitled to leave; (4) he gave proper notice of his intention to take FMLA leave; and (5) his employer denied him the benefits to which he was entitled under the FMLA. [*13]  Lanier v. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr., 527 F. App'x 312, 316 (5th Cir. 2013).
Defendants contend White cannot establish White was entitled to leave at the time of his termination. White contends he is entitled to summary judgment on his interference claim. "Employees are eligible for FMLA leave only so long as they suffer from (1) a serious health condition; and (2) are unable to perform the functions of their position." Dean v. Methodist Hosps. of Dall., Inc., No. 98-11498, 1999 WL 1131958, at *3 (5th Cir. Nov. 17, 1999) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)). The FMLA defines a "serious health condition" as "an illness, injury, impairment or physical condition that involves (1) inpatient care; or (2) continuing treatment by a health care provider." Mauder v. Metro. Transit Auth. of Harris Cty., 446 F.3d 574, 580 (5th Cir. 2006) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D)).
As with his ADAAA and TCHRA claims, White contends only that he was entitled to FMLA leave when terminated because he had not been released by his doctors to return to work, which, again, contradicts White's live pleadings. The Court's analysis supra Part III.A. applies equally to White's interference claim to show White fails to establish that, at the time of White's termination, White was suffering from a serious health condition. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to White, at most, the fact that White was not released from neurosurgery until July 15, 2015, establishes White could not return to work until that [*14]  date; it does not establish White had a serious health condition at the time of his termination. Aside from White's allegation that he was not released, White offers no evidence creating a fact issue or proving as a matter of law that White was suffering from a serious health condition when he was terminated. White therefore fails to establish he was entitled to FMLA leave at that time.14 Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted as to White's FMLA interference claim and White's motion for summary judgment is denied.

E. FMLA Retaliation
White contends Defendants retaliated against White by terminating him based on his exercise of his FMLA rights. Defendants contend White cannot establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation.
To establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, a plaintiff must show (1) he was protected under the FMLA; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) he either was treated less favorably than a similarly situated employee who had not requested leave or the adverse decision was made because he took FMLA leave. Mauder, 446 F.3d at 583 (citing Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare Sys., LLC, 277 F.3d 757, 768 (5th Cir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds by Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006)). There is no dispute that White suffered an adverse employment action when terminated. [*15]  Defendants dispute the first and third elements of White's prima facie case. With regard to the first element, Defendants contend White was not protected under the FMLA. As discussed supra Part III.D., White has not pointed the Court to any evidence showing that he was suffering from a serious health condition at the time of his termination. White was not therefore entitled to FMLA leave—and was not engaged in protected activity—at that time. See Rogers v. Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., No. CA3-99—CV-988—R, 2000 WL 1175647, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 17, 2000) (Buchmeyer, J.), aff'd sub nom. Rogers v. Bell Helicopter Texton, Inc., 252 F.3d 436 (5th Cir. 2001).
However, Defendants do not dispute that White initially requested and was granted FMLA leave following the April 19, 2015 accident.15 The Court therefore finds that, although White was not engaged in protected activity at the time of his termination, White engaged in protected activity in initially requesting and taking FMLA leave. See Amsel v. Tex. Water Dev. Bd., 464 F. App'x 395, 401 (5th Cir. 2012) ("The FMLA's proscriptive protections . . . encompass the employer's conduct both during and after the employee's FMLA leave." (quoting Hunt, 277 F.3d at 768)). The Court thus turns to the third element of White's prima facie retaliation claim.
With regard to causation, White contends (1) the timing of White's termination supports a finding of causation; and (2) White was treated [*16]  differently than other employees who were not on leave. First, the Court finds the twelve weeks between White's request for leave and termination insufficiently close in time to establish that he was terminated because he took FMLA leave. See Porter v. Houma Terrebonne Hous. Auth. Bd. of Com'rs, 810 F.3d 940, 948-49 (5th Cir. 2015) ("The protected act and the adverse employment action must be very close in time to establish causation by timing alone." (quoting Washburn v. Harvey, 504 F.3d 505, 511 (5th Cir. 2007)). Second, White does not identify any specific comparator that is nearly identical to or similarly situated to White. White has not therefore sufficiently established he was treated differently than other employees who were not on leave. See Villalon v. Del Mar Coll. Dist., No. CIV.A. C-09-252, 2010 WL 3221789, at *3 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 13, 2010) (Jack, J.). White therefore fails to show a causal relationship between White's termination and White's original request for and taking of FMLA leave. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted as to White's FMLA retaliation claim.
