REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION GRANTING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
This case is assigned to the Honorable Ron Clark, Chief United States District Judge, and is referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to General Order 05-07. Pending before the undersigned is Defendants Texas Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company, Texas Farm Bureau Underwriters, Texas Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Company, and Farm Bureau County Mutual Insurance Company of Texas' (together, "Texas Farm Bureau") "Motion for Summary Judgment." Doc. No. 24. Texas Farm Bureau argues that Plaintiff John Haynes has (i) failed to present evidence [*2]  sufficient to establish his failure to accommodate claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), (ii) failed to establish that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 applies to Texas Farm Bureau, entitling Texas Farm Bureau to a judgment on the pleadings for purposes of Haynes' Rehabilitation Act claim and (iii) failed to establish that any Texas Farm Bureau employee acted under color of state law for purposes of Haynes' 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim. The undersigned agrees, in part—while summary judgment is appropriate for Haynes' ADA and § 1983 claims, judgment on the pleadings regarding Haynes' Rehabilitation Act claim is not supported by a review of the face of Haynes' First Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 11). Accordingly, the undersigned will convert Texas Farm Bureau's motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding Haynes' Rehabilitation Act claim to a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). Haynes shall have fourteen days from the date of receipt of this report to present evidence to the court supporting the allegation that Texas Farm Bureau receives "federal financial assistance" within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 such that Texas Farm Bureau falls under the purview of the Act's requirements. See 29 U.S.C. § 794.

I. [*3]  FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff John Haynes began working with Texas Farm Bureau in 1995 as an insurance sales representative. Doc. No. 11, at 2. The nature and scope of Haynes' employment is largely the subject of dispute between the parties—Haynes alleges that he was a full-time employee of Texas Farm Bureau, and the parties executed a contract to that effect, while Texas Farm Bureau alleges that Haynes was an independent contractor, contracted to sell insurances policies on behalf of Texas Farm Bureau within Jasper County, Texas. Id. at 2-3; Doc. No. 15, at 2. Haynes claims that although the employment contracts between him and Texas Farm Bureau designate him as an independent contractor, he was "never allowed to operate independently and was a de facto employee of [Texas Farm Bureau]." Doc. No. 11, at 3. Texas Farm Bureau denies these allegations and maintains that at all times during his affiliation with Texas Farm Bureau, Haynes was an independent contractor. Doc. No. 15, at 3.
Texas Farm Bureau alleges that Haynes began failing to meet his life insurance sale quotas, maintaining a "persistency percentage" of 39% in 2013 and -42% in 2014, as well as achieving a sales volume of $750,000 in 2013, [*4]  which was $749,999 short of his $1,500,000 target, and a sales volume of $390,000 in 2014, which was $276,666 short of his $666,666 target. Doc. No. 24, ex. E. Texas Farm Bureau alleges that it attempted to remedy these shortcomings by arranging meetings between Haynes and Haynes' manager, Paul Pustka, to determine methods to improve Haynes' sales production, including the delegation of tasks to Haynes' office subordinates to allow him more time to travel to increase sales. Doc. No. 24, at 11.
Soon thereafter, on or about April 23, 2015, Haynes contacted Pustka and the Vice President of Legal & Compliance for Texas Farm Bureau, John Stephens, informing them both of Haynes' physical illness, ankylosing spondylitis, an arthritic condition that impaired his ability to perform the sales functions expected of him at Texas Farm Bureau. Doc. No. 25, at 4, ex. F at 1. In connection with his condition, Haynes requested "reasonable accommodations" of Texas Farm Bureau, including his treating rheumatologist's recommendation that he refrain from working nights or weekends. Id., ex. U. In response to Haynes' request, Stephens advised Haynes that to the extent he sought "reasonable accommodations" within [*5]  the meaning of the ADA, the ADA's requirements did not apply to him, given his status as an independent contractor. Id., ex. F at 1. Stephens further indicated, however, that Haynes was free to determine the "time, place, and manner of soliciting and servicing policyholders." Id. After three more months where Texas Farm Bureau alleges Haynes' sales performance continued to lag, Texas Farm Bureau terminated its contractual relationship with Haynes on July 31, 2015. Doc. No. 24, at 11.

II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Haynes initially brought suit against Texas Farm Bureau in the 1st Judicial District of Jasper County, Texas, on January 25, 2016. In his state court complaint, Haynes alleged state law claims for breach of contract, fraud, unjust enrichment, conspiracy, violations of the Texas Insurance Code, tortious interference and estoppel, as well as federal law claims for relief under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Doc. No. 1, at 5-8. Texas Farm Bureau removed the suit to the Eastern District of Texas on February 19, 2016. After Texas Farm Bureau filed its initial answer (Doc. No. 5) to Haynes' state court complaint, Haynes then filed his First Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 11) on [*6]  April 25, 2016, restating both his state law and federal law claims and requesting attorneys' fees.

III. LEGAL STANDARD
Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate if "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Ellison v. Software Spectrum, Inc., 85 F.3d 187, 189 (5th Cir. 1996). A genuine dispute of material fact exists "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 248. "A mere scintilla of evidence," however, "will not preclude granting of a motion for summary judgment." Schaefer v. Gulf Coast Reg'l Blood Ctr., 10 F.3d 327, 330 (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam). Thus, summary judgment is proper only if no reasonable fact-finder could find for the non-movant. Kunin v. Feofanov, 69 F.3d 59, 61 (5th Cir. 1995).
The moving party asserting the absence of facts that can be genuinely disputed must support such allegations by citing to specific portions of the record or demonstrating that the materials presented by the non-moving party has not, or cannot, produce evidence in the record that establish a genuine dispute of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A)-(B). In both instances, "the movant bears the burden of identifying those portions of the record it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Triple Tee Golf, Inc. v. Nike, Inc., 485 F.3d 253, 261 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-25, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). In considering the summary [*7]  judgment evidence, the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 255.
If the movant satisfies its burden, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to identify a material fact dispute or rebut the charge that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994). "A fact is 'material' if its resolution in favor of one party might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing law." Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Texas, 560 F.3d 316, 326 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Hamilton v. Segue Software, Inc., 232 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir. 2000) (per curiam)). Like the movant, the non-movant must satisfy its burden through specific citations to the summary judgment evidence in the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); Smith v. U.S., 391 F.3d 621, 625 (5th Cir. 2004).

IV. ANALYSIS
Haynes states several theories for relief under federal law: (i) his employer, Texas Farm Bureau, denied him a reasonable accommodation for his disabling arthritic condition, in violation of the ADA, (ii) Texas Farm Bureau's termination of its employment relationship with him was in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and (iii) Stephens acted under color of state law and in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 when he allegedly informed Haynes that Texas Farm Bureau would pursue legal action against Haynes if he continued to sell insurance [*8]  after Texas Farm Bureau terminated its employment relationship with Haynes.

A. There is a genuine dispute as to whether Texas Farm Bureau treated Haynes as an employee, rather than an independent contractor
Texas Farm Bureau argues that, as a threshold matter, Haynes' ADA claim "must be dismissed because he was not Defendants' employee." Doc. No. 24, at 15. Under the ADA, an employee is defined as "an individual employed by an employer." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(4). Because of the vague nature in which "employee" is defined by statute, the undersigned must examine relevant case law to determine whether Haynes may be properly considered an employee for summary judgment purposes.
Courts in the Fifth Circuit use a "hybrid" economic realities/common law control test to determine whether a person is properly considered an employee or independent contractor under employment discrimination statutes. See Deal v. State Farm Cty. Mut. Ins. Co. of Tex., 5 F.3d 117, 118-19 (5th Cir. 1993). Under this approach, the "right to control an employee's conduct is the most important component of this test." Id. at 119. With respect to the common law evaluation of control, the following six factors are relevant in determining whether an employer maintains control over a worker:
1. Whether the organization can hire or fire [*9]  the individual or set the rules and regulations of the individual's work;
2. Whether and, if so, to what extent the organization supervises the individual's work;
3. Whether the individual reports to someone higher in the organization;
4. Whether and, if so, to what extent the individual is able to influence the organization;
5. Whether the parties intended that the individual be an employee, as expressed in written agreements or contracts; and
6. Whether the individual shares in the profits, losses, and liabilities of the organization.
Clackamas Gastroenterology Assoc's., P.C. v. Wells, 538 U.S. 440, 449-50, 123 S. Ct. 1673, 155 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2003). In considering the six factors, "all of the incidents of the relationship [are relevant], with no one factor being decisive." Id. at 451 (citing Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 324, 112 S. Ct. 1344, 117 L. Ed. 2d 581 (1992)).
There are several factors that suggest Texas Farm Bureau possessed a sufficient right to control Haynes' conduct to create a genuine dispute as to whether Haynes was treated as an employee. Specifically, Haynes alleges that Texas Farm Bureau "dictated, controlled and provided [Haynes'] office facilities" and the office facilities' utilities at no cost to Haynes. Doc. No. 11, at 3. Haynes' employment contract specified that he was to "follow all guidelines and instructions contained in [Texas Farm Bureau's] rate books, manuals, [*10]  advertising guidelines, and underwriting guidelines." Doc. No. 25, ex. G at 2. Haynes' contract also specified that he was not permitted to "make, alter, or discharge any contract of insurance . . . unless authorized by [Texas Farm Bureau]," amongst other limitations on the scope of his authority as an insurance salesman. Id. at 4.
Moreover, Haynes has presented evidence that his contractual relationship with Texas Farm Bureau was terminated as a result of failing to meet certain life insurance sales targets, much akin to an organization firing an individual for failure to satisfy the standards or regulations of Haynes' work. Doc. No. 25, at 9-10. Haynes argues, and Texas Farm Bureau does not dispute, that Haynes was subject to annual performance reviews by his manager, Pustka (Doc. No. 24, ex. E), and Haynes received semi-frequent communications from Pustka regarding performance expectations (Doc. No. 25, ex. J-R), each indicating a degree of supervision of Haynes' work and his reporting to an individual higher up in Texas Farm Bureau than himself. Finally, Haynes has presented evidence that he was required to reimburse Texas Farm Bureau for certain office-related expenses, but that he had minimal [*11]  discretion in such decisions, suggesting that he maintained very little ability to influence Texas Farm Bureau. Doc. No. 25, at 4. Taken as a whole, the undersigned concludes that at a minimum, for summary judgment purposes, Haynes has established a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether he was treated as an employee by Texas Farm Bureau. As such, it is appropriate to consider Haynes as an employee covered by the requirements of the ADA, and the undersigned must next determine whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Haynes was denied a reasonable accommodation by his employer, Texas Farm Bureau.

B. Even if Haynes was treated as an employee by Texas Farm Bureau, he was not denied reasonable accommodations for his disability after making his request
Haynes alleges that Texas Farm Bureau violated the ADA by denying him reasonable accommodations for his arthritic condition. Doc. No. 11, at 6. The ADA makes it unlawful to discriminate against an individual on the basis of their disability in regard to the discharge of employees or other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). A "disability" includes a physical or mental impairment that substantially [*12]  limits one or more major life activities of such individual. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). Discrimination under the ADA includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the known physical limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless that accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also Griffin v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 661 F.3d 216, 224 (5th Cir. 2011). As a threshold matter, the ADA only covers "employees" of covered entities. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). For the reasons discussed above, the undersigned finds that Haynes has established a genuine dispute as to whether his role with Texas Farm Bureau was actually that of an employee, so the next step is to determine whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact that Texas Farm Bureau failed to make reasonable accommodations for Haynes' disability.
Under the ADA, "an employee who needs an accommodation because of a disability has the responsibility of informing her employer." E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d 606, 621 (5th Cir. 2009). Moreover, "where the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer . . . the initial burden rests primarily upon the employee, or his health-care provider, to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, [*13]  and to suggest the reasonable accommodations." Taylor v. Principal Fin. Grp., Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996). Based upon a review of the summary judgment evidence, Haynes notified Texas Farm Bureau of his arthritic condition on April 23, 2015. Doc. No. 25, ex. F at 1. Thus, any allegations of Texas Farm Bureau's failure to accommodate for Haynes' disability are limited to the timeframe after April 23, 2015. In addition to notifying Texas Farm Bureau of his condition, Haynes included the recommendation of his treating rheumatologist that he not work nights or weekends. Id., ex. U. In response to this request, Stephens indicated his belief that the ADA did not apply to Haynes, insofar as Texas Farm Bureau did not deem him an employee. Id., ex. F at 1. Stephens did indicate, however, that Haynes had "the right to determine the time, place, and manner of soliciting and servicing policyholders of [Texas Farm Bureau]." Id.
Based upon a review of the summary judgment evidence, Haynes did not request any reasonable accommodation for his disability until April 23, 2015, at which point Texas Farm Bureau informed him that he was free to set his own hours and times to work, which would enable Haynes to abide by his doctor's instructions to not work nights or weekends. [*14]  To the extent Haynes claims that Texas Farm Bureau refused to allow him "to hire his own assistant to help him sell life insurance products," such a requested accommodation would have been objectively unreasonable. Doc. No. 25, at 21. The ADA does not "require an employer to relieve an employee of essential functions of his or her job, modify those duties, reassign existing employees to perform those jobs, or hire new employees to do so." Keel v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 1:11-CV-248, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112070, at *27, 2012 WL 3263575, at *9 (E.D. Tex. July 17, 2012) (emphasis added) (citing Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, 174 F.3d 615, 621 (5th Cir. 1999), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:11-CV-248, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111934, 2012 WL 3262882 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 9, 2012) (Clark, J.), aff'd, 544 Fed. Appx. 468 (5th Cir. 2013); see also Feist v. Louisiana, 730 F.3d 450, 453 (5th Cir. 2013) ("reasonable accommodations are not restricted to modifications that enable performance of essential job functions . . . (and) the text [of the ADA] gives no indication that an accommodation must facilitate the essential functions of one's position."). Haynes has failed to produce summary judgment evidence that would allow a reasonable finder of fact to conclude that Texas Farm Bureau discriminated against him by failing to accommodate any limitations resulting from his arthritic condition.

C. Because it is unclear from the face of Haynes' First Amended Complaint whether Texas Farm Bureau receives [*15]  federal financial assistance, summary judgment evidence is required to determine whether the Rehabilitation Act applies to Texas Farm Bureau
With respect to Haynes' allegations that Texas Farm Bureau violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by terminating its employment relationship with Haynes, Texas Farm Bureau argues that it is entitled to judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Doc. No. 24, at 21. A Rule 12(c) motion is evaluated by the same standard as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Gentilello v. Rege, 627 F.3d 540, 543-44 (5th Cir. 2010). The central issue in determining whether to grant a judgment on the pleadings is "whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the complaint states a valid claim for relief." Doe v. MySpace, Inc., 528 F.3d 413, 418 (5th Cir. 2008). In the Fifth Circuit, when considering a Rule 12(c) or Rule 12(b)(6) motion, courts generally adhere to the rule that they may not look beyond the face of the complaint. See Lovelace v. Software Spectrum, Inc., 78 F.3d 1015, 1017 (5th Cir. 1996); Jackson v. Procunier, 789 F.2d 307, 309 (5th Cir. 1996).
In order to be subject to the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act, an employer must, among other things, receive federal financial assistance. See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). When claiming recovery under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as Haynes does in his First Amended Complaint, the party claiming recovery must either be a "beneficiary of or a participant in a federally funded [*16]  program or activity and the alleged discrimination must be in connection with that program or activity." See Miller v. Abilene Christian Univ. of Dallas, 517 F. Supp. 437, 439 (N.D. Tex. 1981) (quoting Simpson v. Reynolds Metals Co., Inc., 629 F.2d 1226, 1233 (7th Cir. 1980) ("the statute does not . . . generally forbid discrimination against the handicapped by recipients of federal assistance . . . [t]o be actionable, the discrimination must come in the operation of the program or manifest itself in a handicapped individual's exclusion from the program or a diminution of the benefits he would otherwise receive from the program.").
In their motion, Texas Farm Bureau argues that they "do not run federally-funded programs or activities — and Plaintiff does not allege that they do." Doc. No. 24, at 21 (citing Haynes' deposition transcript, attached as exhibit A to its motion for summary judgment). Although Haynes appears to concede that he does not believe Texas Farm Bureau receives federal financial assistance, his deposition transcript is not contained on the face of his complaint, nor as an accompanying exhibit, and it is improper to consider such extrinsic evidence when deciding a Rule 12(c) motion. Pursuant to Rule 12(d), "if, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as [*17]  one for summary judgment under Rule 56." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). Because Texas Farm Bureau cites to matters outside of Haynes' complaint, which are essential to determining the propriety of dismissing Haynes' Rehabilitation Act claims, the court will convert the portion of Texas Farm Bureau's motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to Haynes' Rehabilitation Act claim to a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Ace Am. Ins. Co. v. Huntsman Corp., 255 F.R.D. 179, 188 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (citing Isquith v. Middle S. Utils., Inc., 847 F.2d 186, 193 n.3 (5th Cir.1988)). Consistent with Rule 12(d), Haynes shall have fourteen days from the date of receiving this report and recommendation to proffer evidence in support of his allegation that Texas Farm Bureau receives federal financial assistance consistent with the above-stated standard for recovery under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) ("All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.").

D. Neither Stephens nor any other Texas Farm Bureau employee acted under color of state law in terminating Texas Farm Bureau's relationship with Haynes
Finally, Haynes alleges that the actions of Texas Farm Bureau employees have generally deprived him of his rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Doc. No. 11, at 6-7. In his response to Texas Farm Bureau's motion for summary judgment, [*18]  Haynes adds additional context to his § 1983 allegations, specifying that he testified in his deposition that Stephens informed Haynes that Texas Farm Bureau would pursue legal action against Haynes if he continued to sell insurance. Doc. No. 25, at 19.1
Under § 1983, individuals maintain a private right of action to redress the violation of constitutional rights or federal law by those acting under color of state law. Tex. Mfr'd. Hous. Ass'n, Inc. v. City of Nederland, 101 F.3d 1095, 1106 (5th Cir. 1996). The statute is not itself a source of substantive rights, but rather it "merely provides 'a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.'" Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1994) (quoting Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 144 n.3, 99 S. Ct. 2689, 61 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1979)). To state a claim of relief under § 1983, Haynes must allege that a person acting under color of state law deprived him of a right secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States. American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 49, 119 S. Ct. 977, 143 L. Ed. 2d 130 (1999); Augustine v. Doe, 740 F.2d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir. 1984). In allegations like those brought by Haynes, where a private citizen is alleged to have committed a § 1983 violation, the plaintiff must offer proof that the citizen is either a state actor or conspired with state actors. See Priester v. Lowndes Cnty., 354 F.3d 414, 420 (5th Cir. 2004) ("To state a cause of action under section 1983, the [plaintiff] must allege that the person who deprived him of a federal right was acting under color of law. For a private citizen . . . to be held liable under section 1983, the plaintiff [*19]  must allege that the citizen conspired with or acted in concert with state actors.") (internal quotations omitted). Haynes fails to offer any evidence that Stephens was a state actor, acted in concert with state actors, or that any other Texas Farm Bureau employee did the same. Instead, he merely asserts that Stephens "claimed that Defendants would aggressively pursue legal claims against Plaintiff if he continued to work in insurance." Doc. No. 27, at 10. This is insufficient to substantiate a claim under § 1983.

V. RECOMMENDATION
The undersigned concludes that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the nature of Haynes' relationship with Texas Farm Bureau was that of employee or independent contractor. Regardless of the nature of Haynes' employment, however, Haynes has failed to present facts sufficient to substantiate his claims for relief under the ADA or § 1983. The court should dismiss those claims with prejudice. Moreover, Haynes shall present evidence that Texas Farm Bureau receives federal financial assistance within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act within the fourteen-day period to file objections to this report. If Haynes is unable to present evidence supporting [*20]  his allegation that Texas Farm Bureau is subject to the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act, those claims should also be dismissed with prejudice. Finally, should the district court dismiss all of Haynes' federal law claims, the court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Haynes' pendent state law claims for breach of contract, fraud, unjust enrichment, conspiracy, violations of section 541.054 of the Texas Insurance Code, tortious interference and estoppel, and dismiss each of those claims without prejudice. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).

VI. OBJECTIONS
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the right to file objections to this report and recommendation. Objections to this report must (1) be in writing, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, (3) be served and filed within fourteen days after being served with a copy of this report; and (4) be no more than eight pages in length. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2); Local Rule CV-72(c). A party who objects to this report is entitled to a de novo determination by the United States District Judge of those proposed findings and recommendations to which a specific objection is timely made. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).
A party's failure to file specific, written objections [*21]  to the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen days of being served with a copy of this report, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States District Judge of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, 276-77 (5th Cir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any such findings of fact and conclusions of law accepted by the United States District Judge. See Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 79 F.3d 1415, 1428-29 (5th Cir. 1996).
