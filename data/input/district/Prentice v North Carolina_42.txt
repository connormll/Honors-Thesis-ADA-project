Opinion



ORDER
On April 23, 2020, Steven Dixon Prentice ("Prentice"), a state inmate proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, filed a complaint alleging claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("RA"), 29 U.S.C. § 791 [D.E. 1, 2, 12]. Prentice filed a memorandum, affidavits, and numerous exhibits in support of his complaint [D.E. 1-1, 3-5, 17]. On February 16, 2021, the court reviewed Prentice's filings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A and allowed Prentice to proceed with his Eighth Amendment claims concerning his medical care against defendants Agarwal, Haynes, Tolman, Curtis, and Lewis and his ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims for failure to make reasonable accommodations for his disabilities [D.E. 18].1
On November 18, 2021, the court dismissed plaintiff's official-capacity section 1983 claims [D.E. 94]. NCPLS assisted Prentice with conducting discovery, which concluded on June 7, 2022. See [D.E. 117, 122]. All defendants have moved for summary judgment [D.E. 126, 134, 149, 156, 165, 183]. Pursuant to Roseboro v. Garrison, 528 F.2d 309, 310 (4th Cir. 1975) (per curiam), the court notified Prentice about each motion for summary judgment, the consequences of failing to respond, and the response deadlines [D.E. 132, 158, 160, [*3]  164, 172, 187]. Prentice responded in opposition [D.E. 175-78, 182, 192]. Two defendants filed replies [D.E. 191, 197, 198]. Several defendants have filed motions to seal [D.E. 131, 148, 155, 162, 171]. Prentice moves to exclude the Rule 26 report defendant Haynes filed in support of his motion for summary judgment. Mot [D.E. 180]; see [D.E. 152-1].2 As explained below, the court grants defendants' motions for summary judgment, grants in part the motions to seal, and denies Prentice's motion.
I.
The allegations of Prentice's complaint relate to medical care he received at four different state prisons since he transferred from federal to state custody in April 2016. See Compl. [D.E. 1] 7-8; [D.E. 10]. Prentice alleges that he has "suffered without medical treatment" for numerous medical conditions, including "Crohn's/IBS-D[,]" hearing loss and failure to replace his hearing aid devices, spinal/nerve damage, and a "persistent dry cough left untreated by [d]efendants." [D.E. 1] 7-8; see [D.E. 1-1] 10-12; [D.E. 10]. Prentice contends that defendants' failure to treat his medical needs constitutes deliberate indifference in violation of the Eighth Amendment [D.E. 1] 7; [D.E. 1-1] 31-34; [D.E. 10]. Prentice also [*4]  contends that in failing to make accommodations "for [Prentice's] verified physical disabilities," defendants violated the ADA and RA. [D.E. 1-1] 8-16; see [D.E. 10] 2-3; [D.E. 14] 3.
Defendant Haynes provided medical treatment to Prentice between August 2016 and June 2018 at Lanesboro Correctional Institution ("Lanesboro"). See Haynes SMF [D.E. 151] ¶ 1.3 Medical providers at Lanesboro, including Haynes, examined Prentice numerous times and ordered various diagnostic tests including labwork, a colonoscopy, and RAST testing. See Haynes App'x [D.E. 152-1] 7-11. The colonoscopy did not show significant pathology or indicate ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Curtis Aff. [D.E. 130] ¶ 15. Medical providers also provided Prentice with "over-the-head medical earphones to replace a broken set," batteries for his hearing aids, a neck brace, an arch support cushion, a back/abdominal binder, and numerous medications in an attempt to address his chronic pain, diarrhea, and other medical conditions. Haynes App'x ¶¶ 7-13. In October 2017, Haynes prescribed a medication called Elavil to address Prentice's back pain. See id. at ¶¶ 13-14. In May 2018, Prentice refused to continue taking it. See [*5]  id. at ¶ 17.
In June 2018, Prentice was transferred to Warren Correctional Institution ("Warren"), where defendant Curtis provided medical care to Prentice. See Curtis Aff. ¶ 4. In July 2018, Curtis reviewed Prentice's chart in connection with his request to renew the medication Loperamide4 and determined "that inmate Prentice would need to be evaluated in a Sick Call Appointment for evaluation as to the reason for which he previously was prescribed Loperamide" because Curtis "wanted to assess his condition before simply renewing this medication." Id. at ¶ 14. In the meantime, Prentice continued to receive Loperamide and other medications, including "a probiotic to aid in digestion" and "an enzyme to aid in the digestion of lactose[.]" Id. at ¶ 13 & n.7. Curtis ordered diagnostic testing, which included labwork and a complete blood count, which were within normal limits, and submitted a utilization review ("UR") request for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy ("EGD") and colonoscopy, which were approved on August 7, 2018. See id. at ¶ 15 & nn.8-9. Curtis continued to prescribe the probiotic and enzyme medications, and ordered a comprehensive metabolic panel. Id. at ¶ 17.
On September [*6]  25, 2018, a physician at Central Prison performed an EGD, which was normal, and a colonoscopy, which revealed small internal hemorrhoids that the physician biopsied. Id. at ¶ 20. The biopsies "showed no evidence of active or any specific colitis[]" and were negative for dysplasia. Id. at ¶ 21. The physician recommended an additional test, which Curtis decided was not medically necessary. Id. at ¶¶ 20, 26. On October 18, 2018, Curtis reviewed Prentice's medical chart concerning several expired prescriptions and decided to wait until Prentice's next medical examination on October 22, 2018, before renewing the prescriptions. Id. at ¶¶ 25-26. At the October 28, 2018 examination, Curtis concluded that "[t]he lack of physical findings and the fact that inmate Prentice's bouts of diarrhea did not occur nocturnally suggested that his symptoms might be psychological and not pathological[.]" Id. at ¶ 26. Curtis "referred inmate Prentice for a mental health encounter with a psychologist to help him develop means to cope with prison life and to investigate whether he was being targeted by other inmates." Id. Curtis also entered orders for additional diagnostic testing, including a second order [*7]  for labwork and "additional orders for a stool culture, fecal fat, fecal leukocytes, ova and parasite tests." Id. All of the labwork was within normal limits. Id. at ¶ 26 n.12. In December 2018, Curtis renewed several medications for Prentice. Id. at ¶ 28. Curtis did not have any further involvement in Prentice's medical treatment before Prentice's February 2019 transfer from Warren to Tabor Correctional Institution ("Tabor"). Id. at ¶¶ 29-31.
Defendant Tolman was involved in Prentice's medical care at both Tabor and Pender Correctional Institution ("Pender") between February and January 2021. See Tolman Decl. [D.E. 137-2] ¶¶ 4-20. In February 2019, Tolman prescribed ibuprofen, acetaminophen, an extra pillow, and thermal underwear "to address Plaintiff's indication for cervicalgia and low back pain[]" and "submitted paperwork in order for Plaintiff to obtain extra toilet paper." Tolman SMF [D.E. 136] ¶¶ 8-11. In March 2019, after Prentice was assessed with IBS-D, Tolman prescribed numerous medications (including Loperamide) and submitted UR requests for an additional medication "and for issues with near and far vision." Id. at ¶ 14. Tolman was not involved in Prentice's medical care [*8]  again until August 2019, when Prentice transferred to Pender. See id. at ¶¶ 15-19. In August 2019, Tolman renewed a medication for Prentice's IBS-D, ordered a cervical collar, and submitted a "rush" UR request for an outside neurology consultation. See id. at ¶¶ 20, 23-24. "On November 16, 2020, Plaintiff requested cough medicine. In response, Defendant Tolman submitted a medication order for cough drops." Id. ¶ 31. In January 2021, Tolman "evaluated Plaintiff for a complaint of low back pain and increased Plaintiff s prescription of meloxicam from 7.5 mg/day to 15.0 mg/day." Id. ¶ 33.
Defendant Lewis was involved in Prentice's medical care at Pender between August 2019 and September 2020. See Lewis Decl. [D.E. 161] ¶ 13. In August 2019, Lewis renewed Prentice's prescription for acetaminophen and submitted a UR request "for a new prescription of tizanidine HCI for pain, based on the recommendation of his neurologist." Id. at ¶ 14. Lewis renewed these prescriptions on several occasions through November 2020. See id. at ¶¶ 16-17, 21-22, 29. In November 2019, Lewis "documented that inmate Prentice's hearing aids did not work properly[,]" and "the hearing aids were taken days later for [*9]  repair by other medical staff" at Central Prison. Id. at ¶¶ 18-19. In February 2020, Lewis examined Prentice and submitted UR requests for Loperamide and a colonoscopy. Id. at ¶ 23. In July 2020, Lewis ordered an x-ray of Prentice's cervical spine, which was unremarkable. Id. at ¶¶ 25, 27. In August 2020, Lewis ordered an audiology examination for Prentice at UNC and submitted a UR request for an outside neurology consultation. Id. at ¶¶ 28, 29. In September 2020, Lewis submitted UR requests for cervical and lumbar spine MRIs. Id. at ¶ 30.
"Since 2004, [defendant] Agarwal has served as Deputy Medical Director of Health and Wellness Services for North Carolina Department of Public Safety-Department of Adult Corrections." Agarwal SMF [D.E. 167] ¶ 10. "UR requests are submitted on behalf of patients by their medical providers during or after medical assessments. UR requests are then sent to DPS Health Services Utilization Review Section, and are reviewed by UR staff, including Dr. Agarwal." Id. at ¶ 19. Those requests are approved or denied based on guidelines and policies set by NC DPS Health Services Section." Id. at ¶ 20. Agarwal has only reviewed two UR requests for Prentice: his tizanidine [*10]  prescription. Id. at ¶¶ 23-24.
Prentice alleges that he has "miss[ed] announcements, orders, events, conversations, information, telephone usage, some radio programming other inmates get to enjoy." Compl. at 9. "Since April 2016 until the filing of this action, Plaintiff has submitted only two (2) Reasonable Accommodation requests[.]" Ishee SMF [D.E. 185] ¶ 1. On June 7, 2016, Prentice requested "'headphones which will block noise and permit listening with my hearing aid.'" Id. at ¶¶ 1-2. Prison staff concluded that Prentice was requesting a medical device, and instructed him to use the sick call process concerning the headphones. Id. at ¶ 3. Prentice received the headphones from his medical, providers. See Haynes App'x ¶ 9. On April 30, 2019, Prentice requested assignment "to a new housing unit, specifically for a 'quieter environment,' a 'bottom bunk,' and an 'individual toilet." Ishee SMF ¶ 4. Prison staff concluded that the requests "were actually custody and medical requests" and "encouraged [Prentice] to follow the appropriate procedures, namely the custody protocol and medical sick call protocol." Id. at ¶¶ 5-6.
II
Summary judgment is appropriate when, after reviewing the record [*11]  as a whole, the court determines that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The party seeking summary judgment initially must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact or the absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its burden, the nonmoving party may not rest on the allegations or denials in its pleading, see Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248-49, but "must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (emphasis and quotation omitted).5 A trial court reviewing a motion for summary judgment should determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists for trial. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. In making this determination, the court must view the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007).
A.
Deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious medical needs violates the Eighth Amendment. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979). In order to prove such a claim, Williams "must demonstrate that the [defendant] acted with 'deliberate indifference' (subjective) to [his] 'serious medical needs' (objective)." Iko v. Shreve, 535 F.3d 225, 241 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104); see, e.g., Sosebee v. Murphy, 797 F.2d 179, 182-83 (4th Cir. 1986). Moreover, for delays in medical [*12]  treatment to violate a prisoner's Eighth Amendment rights, the delay must "result[] in some substantial harm to the patient." Webb v. Hamidullah, 281 F. App'x 159, 166 & n.13 (4th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (unpublished) (collecting cases); see Formica v. Aylor, 739 F. App'x 745, 755 (4th Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (unpublished); Sharpe v. S. C. Dep't of Corrs., 621 F. App'x 732, 733-34 (4th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (unpublished); Davis v. Keller, No. 5:09-CT-3198, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6624, 2012 WL 174381, at *3 (E.D.N.C. Jan. 20, 2012) (unpublished); Dewitt v. Lappin, No. 5:09-CT-3108, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12417, 2011 WL 562801, at *4 (E.D.N.C. Feb. 8, 2011) (unpublished). For example, "marked exacerbations of the prisoner's medical condition or frequent complaints of severe pain" could show substantial harm to the prisoner. Formica, 739 F. App'x at 755 (quotations omitted); see Hamidullah, 281 F. App'x at 167.
Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Prentice, Prentice has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether any defendant was deliberately indifferent to his medical conditions. On the contrary, the record demonstrates that Prentice received constitutionally adequate medical care in response to all of his complaints. Prentice's belief that he required specific medications, a more sympathetic ear, or a different course of treatment amounts to a difference of opinion between a prisoner and a physician, and therefore fails to state a claim of constitutional magnitude. See, e.g., Jackson v. Lightsey, 775 F.3d 170, 178 (4th Cir. 2014); Russell v. Sheffer, 528 F.2d 318, 318-19 (4th Cir. 1975) (per curiam). Thus, the court grants summary judgment to defendants on Prentice's Eighth Amendment claims.
B.
Title II of the ADA provides that "no qualified [*13]  individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Title II applies to state prisons. See, e.g., Pa. Dep't of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 210, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1998); Spencer v. Earley, 278 F. App'x 254, 257-59 (4th Cir. 2008) (unpublished). To state a claim under Title II, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that: (1) he has a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified for the benefits of a public service, program, or activity; and (3) he was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of such service on the basis of his disability. See, e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Constantine v. Rectors & Visitors of George Mason Univ., 411 F.3d 474, 498 (4th Cir. 2005); Baird ex rel. Baird v. Rose, 192 F.3d 462, 467 (4th Cir. 1999); Doe v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1264-65 (4th Cir. 1995). To show that a plaintiff has a disability, "[h]e must prove (1) that he has a physical or mental impairment, (2) that this impairment implicates at least one major life activity, and (3) that the limitation is substantial." Heiko v. Colombo Sav. Bank, F.S.B., 434 F.3d 249, 254 (4th Cir. 2006); see 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). A plaintiff may assert a violation of Title II based on "(1) intentional discrimination or disparate treatment; (2) disparate impact; and (3) failure to make reasonable accommodations." A Helping Hand, LLC v. Balt. Cnty., 515 F.3d 356, 362 (4th Cir. 2008).
The State (through Ishee in his official capacity) argues that it is entitled to sovereign immunity from any damages under the Eleventh Amendment [D.E. 184] 5-11. The [*14]  court must determine, "on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the State's alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid." United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 159, 126 S. Ct. 877, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006); see Spencer, 278 F. App'x at 258.
Prentice's wholly conclusory and unverified allegations fail to identify a "service, program, or activity" covered by the ADA, or how defendants denied him meaningful access to any "service, program, or activity" as a result of any disability. See, e.g., Neal, 53 F.4th at 144; Ashcroft v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 575 F. Supp. 3d 418, 426 (W.D.N.Y. 2021); Dalton v. Clements, No. 8:21-CV-00986, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 231635, 2021 WL 6494774, at *7 (D.S.C. Nov. 2, 2021) (unpublished) (slip opinion), report and recommendation adopted, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 230907, 2021 WL 5711289 (D.S.C. Dec. 2, 2021) (unpublished) (slip opinion); Smith v. Dunn, 568 F. Supp. 3d 1244, 1257 (M.D. Ala. 2021), aff'd sub nom. Smith v. Comm'r Ala. Dep't of Corr., No. 21-13581, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 31678, 2021 WL 4916001 (11th Cir. Oct. 21, 2021) (unpublished), cert. denied sub nom. Smith v. Dunn, No. 21-6055 (S. Ct. Oct. 21, 2021).6 Moreover, Prentice has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether "disability 'played a motivating role' in [any] adverse action" under Title II. Constantine, 411 F.3d at 498 n.17 (quoting Baird, 192 F.3d at 469-70).
As for the remainder of the Georgia test, Prentice has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether his conditions of confinement violate either the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment. See Alster v. Goord, 745 F. Supp. 2d 317, 339 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); Chase v. Baskerville, 508 F. Supp. 2d 492, 506 (ED. Va. 2007), aff'd, 305 F. App'x 135 (4th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (unpublished); [*15]  cf. Leak v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, No. 5:19-CT-3012, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180341, 2020 WL 5822213, at *4 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 30, 2020) (unpublished) (collecting cases); see also Lenti v. Connecticut, No. 3:20-CV-127, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131189, 2020 WL 4275600, at *10 (D. Conn. July 24, 2020) (unpublished) (collecting cases).
"Claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against State Defendants in their official capacities are not specifically barred by the Eleventh Amendment." Andino v. Fischer, 698 F. Supp. 2d 362, 380 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); see Randolph v. Rodgers, 253 F.3d 342, 345 (8th Cir. 2001); Brown, 383 F. Supp. 3d at 552; Reaves v. Dep't of Corr., 195 F. Supp. 3d 383, 419 (D. Mass. 2016). Prentice, however, has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to any violation of the ADA warranting prospective injunctive relief. See Dalton, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 231635, 2021 WL 6494774, at *6. Accordingly, the court grants Ishee's motion for summary judgment.
C.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . ." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Due to the similar statutory language in the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, the acts generally are construed to impose the same requirements, and the Rehabilitation Act also applies to state prisons. See, e.g., Seremeth v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs Frederick Cnty., 673 F.3d 333, 336 n.1 (4th Cir. 2012); Spencer, 278 F. App'x at 257-59; Baird, 192 F.3d at 468; Doe, 50 F.3d at 1264-65. The causation standard is slightly different. Under the Rehabilitation Act, Prentice must "prove that the defendants' discriminatory conduct was 'solely by reason' of the plaintiff's disability." Constantine, 411 F.3d at 498 n.17 (quoting Baird, 192 F.3d at 469-70).
As with his ADA claim, Prentice has failed to [*16]  create a genuine issue of material fact under the Rehabilitation Act. Accordingly, the court grants Ishee's motion for summary judgment.
D.
As for defendants' motions to seal, the court has considered the motions to seal under the governing standard. See, e.g., Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 272-73 (4th Cir. 2014). The court grants the motions in part and directs the clerk to unseal the parties' filings at [D.E. 154, 157, 159, 162, 169]. The clerk shall maintain the filings at [D.E. 130, 138-147, 153, 161, 170] under seal.
III.
In sum, the court DENIES plaintiff's motion [D.E. 180]. The court GRANTS IN PART defendants' motions to seal [D.E. 131, 148, 155, 162, 171] and GRANTS defendants' motions for summary judgment [D.E. 126, 134, 149, 156, 165, 183]. The clerk shall close the case.
SO ORDERED. This 3 day of March, 2023.
