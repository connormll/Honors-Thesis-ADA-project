CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings: Order (1) GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 26) (IN CHAMBERS)
Before the Court is a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants Louis DeJoy ("Postmaster") and the United States Postal Service ("USPS") (collectively, Defendants"). ("Motion," Dkt. No. 26.) On August 27, 2021, the Court took the Motion under submission. (Dkt. No. 38.) The Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution [*2]  without a hearing. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. (Dkt. No. 38.) Upon consideration of the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the Motion.

I. BACKGROUND
On July 8, 2020, Plaintiff Harold J. Thomas ("Thomas") filed a complaint against Defendant Megan J. Brennan, Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service ("Brennan" or "USPS"). ("Complaint," Dkt. No. 1.) The Complaint asserted four causes of action under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. (See id.)
On January 7, 2021, Mr. Thomas filed a first amended complaint, which is the operative complaint. ("FAC," Dkt. No. 21.) The FAC replaced Ms. Brennan with Mr. DeJoy as a Defendant. (Id. ¶ 3.) Mr. Thomas alleges five causes of action: (1) disability discrimination in violation of the Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 791; (2) harassment based on physical disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act; (3) failure to provide reasonable accommodation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act; (4) failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of the Rehabilitation Act; and (5) retaliation in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12203. (Id. ¶¶59-97.)
On June 28, 2021, Defendants filed the instant Motion1, along with the following documents:
• Statement of Undisputed Facts ("DSUF," Dkt. No. 26-1);
• Declaration of Irene McKinney [*3]  ("McKinney Decl.," Dkt. No. 26-2);
• Declaration of Sylvia Dominguez ("Dominguez Decl.," Dkt. No. 26-3);
• Declaration of Hillary Burrelle ("Burelle Decl.," Dkt. No. 26-4); and
• Supporting exhibits (Dkt. Nos. 26-5 to 26-18).
On July 12, 2021, Mr. Thomas opposed. ("Opposition," Dkt. No. 29.) He submitted a statement of genuine disputes of material fact ("PSGD," Dkt. No.29-1), as well as his own statement of undisputed facts ("PSUF," Dkt. No. 29-1 at 94). In addition, Mr. Thomas filed the following documents:
• Objections to Evidence ("Plaintiff's Evidentiary Objections," Dkt. No. 29-4)
• Declaration of Nancyrose Hernandez ("Hernandez Decl.," Dkt. No. 29-2);
• Declaration of Harold Thomas ("Thomas Decl.," Dkt. No. 29-3);
• Exhibits 1 to 24 (Dkt. Nos. 29-5 to 29-28); and
• Exhibits A to J (Dkt. Nos. 29-29 to 29-38).
Defendants replied on July 19, 2021, ("Reply," Dkt. No. 30), along with their own evidentiary objections ("Defendants' Evidentiary Objections," Dkt. No. 30-1).

II. FACTS
The following material facts are sufficiently supported by admissible evidence and are uncontroverted, except as noted. They are "admitted to exist without controversy" for purposes of the Motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); L.R. 56-3. The Court considers [*4]  the parties' objections where necessary.2 All other objections are OVERRULED AS MOOT.
In November 2014, Mr. Thomas was hired as a postal support employee ("PSE") for the USPS Processing and Distribution Center in Moreno Valley, California ("Moreno Valley P&DC" or "Moreno Valley facility"). (DSUF ¶ 1.) As a PSE, Mr. Thomas performed mail processing clerk duties and was classified as a temporary employee. (Id. ¶ 2.) His schedule would fluctuate based on the needs of the departments. ("Thomas Deposition," Hernandez Decl., Ex. 22, at 22:3-10.) According to Mr. Thomas, a supervisor at the San Bernardino facility called Mr. Thomas's regular supervisor at the Moreno Valley facility and said, "Hey, the guy with the limp, he works really hard. He is a really good worker." (DSUF ¶ 19.)
The Moreno Valley P&DC has many departments in which it utilizes PSEs and regular career employees, including the manual flats department, the Automated Parcel Bundle Sorter ("APBS") department, the Flats Sorting Sequence ("FSS") department, the Automated Flats Sorter Machine ("AFSM") department, and the automation department. (DSUF ¶ 4.)
In or around June 2018, Mr. Thomas was converted to a full-time career [*5]  employee. (Id. ¶ 5.) As a career employee, he received a salary increase and became eligible to bid on career positions in specific departments of the Moreno Valley branch. (Id. ¶ 6.) Mr. Thomas was not immediately assigned to a specific department because there were no open bid positions at the time. (Id. ¶ 7.) He applied to bid positions in the FSS and APBS departments, but did not receive those positions. (Id. ¶ 9.)
By February 2019, Mr. Thomas was still unassigned. (Id. ¶ 10.) At that time, bid positions became available in the Automation department. (Id. ¶ 11.) In or around March 2019, Mr. Thomas was assigned to a bid position in Automation. (Id. ¶ 13.) His job duties in automation included lifting tubs of mail, placing mail on a sorter machine, sweeping the sorter machines to clear the mail, and putting mail in the proper slots per zip code. (Id. ¶ 15.) The change in his overall occupational duties caused him more pain in his lower back and his bilateral knee joints. (PSUF ¶ 86.) Mr. Thomas searched for available bid positions after March 2019, but found none. (Id. ¶ 85.)
In or around February/March 2019, Mr. Thomas left work, feeling weak, light-headed, dizzy, and extremely ill. [*6]  (Id. ¶ 87.) His doctor informed that he had nearly suffered a stroke, his blood pressure was unhealthily high, and he needed to take a three- to four-day medical leave to recover. (Id.) After this incident, Mr. Thomas informed Irene McKinney, his manager, that he could not do the Automation job and inquired if there was another position to which he could move. (DSUF ¶ 21; PSGD ¶ 21.) Ms. McKinney told Mr. Thomas to submit a request for light duty with medical documentation. (DSUF ¶ 22.)
In mid-April 2019, Mr. Thomas submitted his first Request for Temporary Light Duty along with a Physician Certification completed by his orthopedic doctor. (McKinney Decl. ¶ 12; PSUF ¶ 84.) The Physician Certification indicated that Plaintiff's ability to perform the following tasks continuously or intermittently was limited to:

("April 2019 Light Duty Request," McKinney Decl., Ex. 8 at 2.)
Ms. McKinney believed that the above notation identified Mr. Thomas's ability to continuously stand and walk as "1 hour" and discussed this restriction with Mr. Thomas. (McKinney [*7]  Decl. ¶ 12; DSUF ¶ 25.) Mr. Thomas informed Ms. McKinney that he could stand for more than one hour. (DSUF ¶ 26.)
On or around April 12, 2019, Sonya Murray authorized Mr. Thomas to work in the Manual Letters department to accommodate his request. (Id. ¶ 29; PSGD ¶ 29.) He stayed in this assignment through May 18, 2019. (PSUF ¶ 92.)
While working in Manual Letters, Mr. Thomas asserts that he could perform the essential functions of his job without issues, and he did a great job. (Id. ¶ 91.) Mr. Thomas was the only employee working in Manual Letters during his tour. (Id. ¶ 94.) The parties dispute whether there was sufficient work in the manual letters department. Defendant asserts that the amount of work available there fluctuates and there is not consistently eight hours of work for every shift. (McKinney Decl. ¶ 19; Thomas Dep. Tr. at 86:15-87:13.) There is no dedicated bid position in the manual letters department. (DSUF ¶ 30.) Plaintiff counters that work was available in the manual letters department in May 2019, and Plaintiff worked eight hours per day in that department from April 12, 2019 to May 18, 2019. (PSGD ¶ 31.)
While Mr. Thomas worked in Manual Letters, Ms. McKinney and [*8]  Robert Gil, Mr. Thomas's supervisor, berated him daily about when he would return to his physician to change his medical restrictions. (PSUF ¶ 95.) Mr. Thomas explained to Ms. McKinney that he had a scheduled appointment and that his restrictions were good for four to six months. (Id. ¶ 96.)
In Manual Letters, Mr. Thomas used a chair that was always in operation, since the start of his employment in March 2014. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 29.) On April 16, 2019, he noticed that the armchair was missing and a stool was in its place in his workplace. (Id. ¶ 34.) Because of his sciatica, Mr. Thomas retrieved an armchair from Nixies. (Id.) However, Ms. McKinney approached him, informed him that "chairs are not to be here," and told him to return the chair to the Nixies workstation. (Id.) The parties disagree as to why Mr. Thomas was disallowed from using his chair. (PSGD ¶ 33.) Defendants assert that the decision was based on a directive from USPS management, who ordered the removal of armchairs from Manual Letters. (DSUF ¶¶ 61-63.) Mr. Thomas claims that Ms. McKinney removed the chair in retaliation. (PSGD ¶¶ 61-63.)
Mr. Thomas did not use the rest bar stool in Manual Letters because it aggravated [*9]  his sciatica. (DSUF ¶ 32.) He points out, however, that he could perform the essential functions of his job without issue in Manual Letters from April 2019 to May 2019. (PSGD ¶ 32.)
On May 18, 2019, Ms. McKinney spoke with Mr. Thomas about his work restrictions. (DSUF ¶ 34.) She told him that she could only allow him to work one hour per day. (Id. ¶ 35.) Mr. Thomas replied that he could not afford to work only one hour per day. (Id. ¶ 36.) Ms. McKinney told him that he needed to go back to the doctor to change his orders. (Thomas Depo. 117:14-120:4.) Mr. Thomas responded, "why would he do that when my - my condition is permanent? It is not going to get any better. I'm 60-something-years-old." (Id. at 120:5-7.) Ms. McKinney responded, "don't come back until he changes your orders." (Id. at 120:11-12.)
Ms. McKinney provided Mr. Thomas with the paperwork to request medical leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). (McKinney Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. 25.) Mr. Thomas argues that she never gave him the option to agree or disagree, and that he did not request extended leave as an accommodation, nor was this discussed as an accommodation between management, the District Reasonable Accommodations [*10]  Committee ("DRAC"), and Mr. Thomas. (Thomas Decl., Pl.'s Ex. 37; Thomas Depo. 121:14-123:1.) Ms. McKinley advised Mr. Thomas to ask his union steward about the DRAC. (Thomas Depo. 145:25-146:8.) Defendants approved Mr. Thomas's request for FMLA medical leave. (Id. 123:21-125:19.) Mr. Thomas argues that Ms. McKinney never referred him to the DRAC, as required by USPS's policy. (PSGD ¶ 39.)
Mr. Thomas remained on medical leave after May 18, 2021. (DSUF ¶ 41.) He has not worked a shift with Defendant since May 2019. (McKinney Decl. ¶ 26.)
Ms. McKinney asserts that on June 21, 2019, she received Mr. Thomas's updated medical restrictions from a union representative. (DSUF ¶ 23.) A few days later, Mr. Thomas received a denial of his light duty request. (Id. ¶ 46; PSGD ¶ 46.)
In June 2019, Mr. Thomas was referred to DRAC for a meeting. (DSUF ¶ 47.) On June 24, 2019, the DRAC co-chair sent a letter asking for Mr. Thomas's medical information and a Reasonable Accommodation Request form. (Id. ¶ 48.) Mr. Thomas completed the form and DRAC received the form on or around July 5, 2019. (Id. ¶ 49.)
On August 6, 2019, DRAC held a meeting with Mr. Thomas. (Id. ¶ 54.) In attendance were Mr. Thomas, DRAC [*11]  co-chair Sylvia Dominguez, Ms. McKinney, Occupational Health Nurse Karen Bernaldez, Occupational Health Nurse Jennifer Cesar, Disability Compliance representative Teresa Navarette, DRAC chair Barbara Rodriguez, and Manager Diane Kawamoto. (Id. ¶ 55.) The parties dispute whether the committee members spoke with Mr. Thomas about his physical restrictions, his duties in Automation, and his request to be reassigned. (Id. ¶ 56; PSGD ¶ 56; PSUF ¶ 124.) DRAC recommended that Mr. Thomas continue to monitor USPS's E-Reassign website to apply for bid positions within or outside of his craft. (DSUF ¶ 59.) Because Mr. Thomas's restrictions were set to expire on August 31, 2019, DRAC told Mr. Thomas to submit updated restrictions at that time. (Id. ¶ 58.) After the meeting, DRAC closed Mr. Thomas's case. (PSGD ¶ 59.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden of informing the district court of the basis for its motion and identifying the portions of the pleadings and record that it believes demonstrate the absence of an issue of [*12]  material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). Where the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need not produce evidence negating or disproving every essential element of the non-moving party's case. Id. at 325. Instead, the moving party need only prove there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Id.; In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010). The party seeking summary judgment must show that "under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986).
If the moving party has sustained its burden, the non-moving party must then show that there is a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. A genuine issue of material fact exists "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. "This burden is not a light one. The non-moving party must show more than the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d at 387 (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252). The non-moving party must make this showing on all matters placed at issue by the motion as to which it has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
When deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir. 1991). Thus, summary judgment [*13]  for the moving party is proper when a "rational trier of fact" would not be able to find for the non-moving party based on the record taken as a whole. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).

IV. DISCUSSION
The Postmaster General moves for summary judgment on Mr. Thomas's claims of disability discrimination, harassment, failure to provide reasonable accommodation, and failure to engage in the interactive process under the Rehabilitation Act. The Postmaster General also seeks summary judgment on Mr. Thomas's retaliation claim under the ADA. (See Mot.)

A. Disability Discrimination (Claim One)
In his first cause of action, Mr. Thomas alleges that USPS discriminated against him because it failed to accommodate his disability, which prevents him from standing for long periods of time. (FAC ¶¶ 59-69.) The Postmaster General argues that Mr. Thomas's prima facie case fails because continuous standing is an essential function of his job as an Automation clerk, which he is unable to perform, and his requested accommodations were unreasonable. (Mot. at 11-14.) Nor, in his view, can Mr. Thomas prove that USPS took any adverse action against him based on his disability. (Id. at 15.) Mr. Thomas counters that he has proffered evidence of his ability to perform [*14]  the essential functions of his job as a Mail Processing Clerk and that his requested accommodations were reasonable. (Opp'n at 14-18.) He argues that USPS's denial of these accommodations and its decision to place him on permanent medical leave were discriminatory. (Opp'n at 18-21.)
Mr. Thomas is a federal employee. (DSUF ¶ 1.) As such, Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 791, provides "the exclusive remedy" for his workplace disability discrimination claim.3 Boyd v. U.S. Postal Serv., 752 F.2d 410, 413 (9th Cir. 1985). "The Rehabilitation Act requires that government agencies reasonably accommodate an employee's disability." McLean v. Runyon, 222 F.3d 1150, 1153 (9th Cir. 2000). "In determining whether a federal agency has violated the Rehabilitation Act, the standards under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act ('ADA') apply." Id.; 29 U.S.C. § 791(f). To state a prima facie case of disability discrimination under Section 501, "a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) she is a person with a disability, (2) who is otherwise qualified for employment, and (3) suffered discrimination because of her disability." Walton v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 492 F.3d 998, 1005 (9th Cir. 2007). Here, the Postmaster General contests the second and third elements.

1. Otherwise Qualified for Employment
"In the employment context, an otherwise qualified person is one who can perform 'the essential functions' of the job in question," with or without reasonable accommodation. School Bd. of Nassau Cnty. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17 (1987) (quoting 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(k)); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m). The [*15]  "burden of production" lies with the "employer to come forward with evidence of those essential functions," even though "the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of persuading the fact finder that he can perform the job's essential functions." Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 991 (9th Cir. 2007). A court does "not reach the issue of reasonable accommodation unless the court first finds that an individual cannot perform the essential functions of her job" without an accommodation. Lucero v. Hart, 915 F.2d 1367 1372 (9th Cir. 1990). Accordingly, the Court's inquiry is two-pronged: (1) whether the Postmaster General has sufficiently identified the essential functions of Mr. Thomas's position; and (2) whether Mr. Thomas has shown that he can perform those functions without a reasonable accommodation or, if not, with a reasonable accommodation.

a. Essential Functions
"The term essential functions means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1). It "does not include the marginal functions of the position." Id. The determination of a job's essential functions is "[a] highly fact-specific inquiry." Cripe v. City of San Jose, 261 F.3d 877, 888 n.12 (9th Cir. 2001). A court "shall" consider "the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential," including any "written description" [*16]  of the job prepared by an employer for advertisement or interview purposes. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "Such evidence, however, is not conclusive: 'an employer may not turn every condition of employment which it elects to adopt into a job function, let alone an essential job function, merely by including it in a job description.'" Rohr v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement & Power Dist., 555 F.3d 850, 864 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Cripe, 261 F.3d at 887). "Where there is conflict in the evidence regarding the essential functions of a position, we conclude that there is a factual dispute, notwithstanding the job descriptions that an employer has prepared." Id. (internal alterations and citation omitted).
At base, the parties disagree on what job is at issue here. The Postmaster General asserts that Mr. Thomas's bid assignment as "an automation bid employee" controls, which requires continuous standing. (Mot. at 11; DSUF ¶ 13.) In support, the Postmaster General submits the declaration of Irene McKinney, Mr. Thomas's former supervisor, who declares that no fulltime employee can be permanently unassigned and that "USPS cannot transfer regular employees between bid assignments without going through the prescribed bidding procedures." (Kinney Decl. ¶¶ 4-6.) It is undisputed that Mr. Thomas was assigned to the Automation department. [*17]  (DSUF ¶ 13.)
Mr. Thomas responds that his formal title is "Mail Processing Clerk" ("MPC"), a general position without the more specialized responsibilities of an Automation clerk, like continuous standing. (Opp'n at 14; PSGD ¶ 16.) He states in his declaration that he became an MPC when he converted from a temporary employee to a full-time career employee. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 4.) His grievance and employment-related documents also list his position or title as a "mail processing clerk," "clerk," or "distribution clerk." (Hernandez Decl., Ex. 2 at 2; EEO Complaint, Id. at 5; RAC Referral, Hernandez Decl., Ex. 8 at 1; RAC Request, Hernandez Decl., Ex. 9 at 1; "Notification of Personnel Action," Hernandez Decl., Ex. 23.)
Mr. Thomas has raised a factual dispute from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the "the relevant 'position' is not the specific post of [Automation clerk] but rather than general category of [Mail Processing Clerk]." Miller v. Cal. Dep't of Corr., 225 F.3d 663, 2000 WL 689585, at *2 (9th Cir. 2000). Defendants' evidence suggests the permanency of an assignment. At the same time, there is no official documentation of Mr. Thomas's assignment to Automation, only declarations and deposition testimony. Instead, as noted above, Mr. Thomas's grievance-related [*18]  documents list him as an MPC. USPS has a formal job description for the MPC position but not for the Automation assignment. ("MPC Posting," Thomas Decl., Ex. A.) The MPC posting states that the clerk performs duties "[o]n a rotation basis" and "[p]erforms other job related tasks in support of primary duties." (See id.) Furthermore, is undisputed that Mr. Thomas worked for almost nine months as an unassigned MPC performing non-Automation duties before his assignment to Automation. (DSUF ¶ 13.) While the Postmaster General argues that career employees' "primary assignment is to their bid department," he proffers no evidence in support of this assertion. (Reply at 4-5.) Viewing these facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Thomas, a reasonable jury may find that Mr. Thomas's duties as an Automation clerk are marginal and that his principal duties are those of an MPC. See Morton v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 272 F.3d 1249, 1252, 54-56 (9th Cir. 2001), overruled on other grounds by Bates, 511 F.3d at 982 (noting that "[a]ll of UPS's drivers hold the title of package car driver, although the duties of package car drivers vary based on seniority," and analyzing whether plaintiff, who requested to be "a swing driver," could perform the "essential function[s] of the job of package car driver"). [*19] 
Assuming that MPC is the relevant position, the Court finds that the Postmaster General fails to meet its initial burden of showing that continuous standing is an essential function. The Postmaster General submits evidence that tends to prove that an Automation clerk must stand continuously. (DSUF ¶ 16 (citing McKinney Decl. ¶ 9; Thomas Depo. 50:24-51:4).) It is also undisputed that an Automation clerk's duties include "lifting tubs of mail, placing mail on a sorter machine, sweeping the sorter machines to clear the mail, and putting mail in the proper slots per zip code." (DSUF ¶ 17.) But the Postmaster General proffers no evidence that an MPC must "inevitab[ly]" stand continuously in any other bid assignments, like Automated Parcel Bundle Sorter ("APBS") or Flats Sorting Sequence ("FSS"). Cripe, 261 F.3d at 889 (finding "a factual dispute as to whether the ability to make a forcible arrest is an essential function of all the specialized-assignment positions that the plaintiffs seek the opportunity to fill") (emphasis in original). In fact, he fails to provide any evidence of an MPC's functions, despite bearing the burden to do so. See Bates, 511 F.3d at 992 (finding that "[b]ecause UPS has linked hearing with safe driving, [*20]  UPS bears the burden to prove that nexus").
Even if Defendants had met their burden of production, Mr. Thomas creates a triable issue of fact on whether continuous standing is an essential function of an MPC. He submits the MPC Posting, which does not mandate continuous standing. (See MPC Posting.) Some tasks, such as "loads mail onto automated equipment" and "clears jams," may necessitate intermittent standing, but there is no proof that they demand continuous standing. (Id.) Other tasks, such as "enters sort plan and starts equipment," "monitors flow of mail to ensure continuous feed," "stops equipment when distribution run or operation is completed," "[r]uns machine reports," "maintain[s] records of mails," and "examine[s] balances in advance deposit accounts" may not require any standing. (Id.) A reasonable jury may infer from this description that an MPC need not stand continuously to fulfill his or her duties. C.f. Chapman v. Potter, 300 F. App'x 493, 493-94 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding that the USPS "was not required to exempt" plaintiff from moving mail, "which the job description makes clear is an essential function").
Further, Mr. Thomas worked as an unassigned MPC seemingly without issue and in Manual Letters, a non-bid position that [*21]  allows an employee to use a rest bar stool while working. (DSUF ¶ 13; PSUF ¶¶ 77-78; McKinney Decl. ¶¶ 19, 22; Thomas Depo. 85:23-86:14.) Because this evidence shows that Mr. Thomas was allowed to perform work that did not require standing continuously, the Court cannot conclude that the ability to stand continuously is essential. See Lazcano v. Potter, 468 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 1167-68 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (finding triable issue as to whether "delivering and casing mail" was an essential function of "a letter carrier," when plaintiff "could at least partly perform nine out of [the] eleven duties," "was employed by the USPS as a 'modified city carrier' for many years[,] and allowed to perform functions other than delivering and casing mail"). Therefore, summary judgment is not appropriate on this element.

b. Reasonable Accommodations
Mr. Thomas alleges that he required a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of his job.4 (FAC ¶¶ 26, 28, 61-64.) Specifically, he alleges that USPS could have temporarily reassigned him either to Manual Letters or to light-duty work that rotated among different departments, including Manual Letters, but failed to do so. (Id. ¶¶ 39, 45, 62.)
If an employee requires an accommodation to perform the essential [*22]  functions of his job, a court must "consider whether any 'reasonable accommodation' by the employer would enable the [employee] to perform those functions." Arline, 480 U.S. at 287 n.17. Mr. Thomas bears the "initial burden" of "showing the existence of a reasonable accommodation." Zukle v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 166 F.3d 1041, 1047 (9th Cir. 1999) (internal citations omitted). He need "only provide evidence sufficient to make 'at least a facial showing that reasonable accommodation is possible.'" Buckingham v. United States, 998 F.2d 735, 740 (9th Cir. 1993). Once Mr. Thomas "establishe[s] the existence of a reasonable accommodation," then "the burden switches to the defendant to show that this accommodation would constitute an undue hardship." Zukle, 166 F.3d at 1047. An "[a]ccommodation is not reasonable if it either imposes undue financial and administrative burdens on [the employer]" or "requires a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program." Arline, 480 U.S. at 287 n.17 (internal citations omitted).

i. Reassignment to Manual Letters
The Postmaster General argues that a reassignment to Manual Letters is unreasonable because (1) it would violate the seniority provision of the USPS's collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") with the American Postal Workers Union ("APWU"); and (2) it would create a new position because full-time work is unavailable in Manual Letters. (Mot. at 12-14; [*23]  Reply at 3-4.)
The Court finds that the Postmaster General fails to show a direct conflict between a reassignment to Manual Letters and the CBA's seniority system. A reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act may include "the duty to reassign an employee to a vacant position.," as well as "modifications made to the work environment and schedule of the employee's current job." McLean, 222 F.3d at 1153; Brown v. Potter, 457 F. App'x 668, 670 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)-(2)). However, "an accommodation that would compel an employer to violate a CBA is unreasonable." Willis v. Pac. Maritime Ass'n, 244 F.3d 675, 681 (9th Cir. 2001). This per se rule is "specifically limited ... to 'bona fide seniority systems.'" Cripe, 261 F.3d at 892. An employee is not precluded "from arguing that a proposed accommodation is reasonable despite a conflict with a [CBA] provision that does not contain a bona fide seniority system." Id.; see also Johns v. Brennan, 761 F. App'x 742, 747 (9th Cir. 2019) (finding that Willis applies "only where there is a direct conflict between the proposed accommodation and the union contract"). A "bona fide seniority system" is one "created for legitimate purposes, rather than for the purpose of discrimination." Willis, 244 F.3d at 682.
Here, the parties do not dispute that the CBA implements a bona fide seniority system. ("CBA," McKinney Decl., Ex. 23.) This provision, however, only applies to open bid positions. (Id., Article [*24]  37.2.B ("Seniority for full-time employees for bidding and other purposes shall be applied in accordance with the National Agreement."); McKinney Decl. ¶ 5.) Therefore, a reassignment cannot "conflict with the USPS's and Union's prescribed bidding process and seniority system under the Collective Bargaining Agreement." (Dominguez Decl. ¶ 9.) According to Ms. McKinney, "[t]he Moreno Valley Processing and Distribution Center does not have a full-time bid position in the manual letters department." (McKinney Decl. ¶ 19.) Because an assignment to Manual Letters is a non-bid position unaffected by the CBA's bidding process, the Postmaster General's own evidence fails to demonstrate that a reassignment to Manual Letters is per se unreasonable.5
Mr. Thomas also raises a triable issue as to whether a reassignment to Manual Letters necessarily creates a new position. A federal employer holds no obligation to create a new position as an accommodation. See Wellington v. Lyon Cnty. Sch. Dist., 187 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that a "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring" or "reassignment to a vacant position," but does not "include creation of a new job"); Hansen v. Robinson Nev. Mining Co., 668 F. App'x 257, 258 (9th Cir. 2016) (finding that "the failure to offer a 'light duty' position [*25]  does not violate the ADA" when "'[l]ight duty' is not an existing, vacant position"). Here, Ms. McKinney declares that no full-time bid position exists in Manual Letters and that an average of just "three hours of work" exists per shift. (McKinney Decl. ¶ 19.) This evidence supports the Postmaster General's position that there are no vacancies in Manual Letters. However, Mr. Thomas testifies that he has, at time, worked in Manual Letters "for an entire tour." (Thomas Depo. 86:18-24.) He further declares that "employees regularly worked in the area for up to eight hours, and from April 15, 2019 through May 18, 2019, the [sic] was enough work in manual letters to allow me to work eight (8) hours per day." (Thomas Decl. ¶ 25.) As such, there is a genuine factual dispute as to whether full-time work is available in Manual Letters. A reasonable jury drawing all inferences in Mr. Thomas's favor could find that full-time work is available in Manual Letters and that a vacancy exists. Accordingly, material disputes preclude summary judgment on this basis.

ii. Reassignment to Rotational Light-Duty Work
The Postmaster General argues that a reassignment to rotational, light-duty work would also [*26]  violate the CBA and require the creation of a new position. (Mot. at 14; Reply at 4-5.) These arguments fall short.
Genuine disputes of material fact prevent a determination that a rotational light-duty position violates the CBA. The Postmaster General contends that this accommodation requires a new bid position that must undergo the CBA's bidding procedure since no permanent, rotational bid position currently exists. (Mot. at 14; Reply at 4.) For support, the Postmaster General cites Mr. Thomas's deposition testimony that his conditions were "permanent" and did not allow him to perform the essential functions of an Automation clerk. (Thomas Depo. 120:5-7, 123:6-8, 125:1-3.) However, this argument equates a permanent reassignment from Automation with a permanent rotational position. According to Ms. McKinney, Mr. Thomas always had the option to apply for other bid positions. (McKinney Decl. ¶ 25.) Mr. Thomas declares that after his assignment to Automation, he had searched for available bid positions but had found none. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 22.) Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Thomas, a reasonable jury could infer that Mr. Thomas required a rotational position only until [*27]  an alternative bid position became available. See Dark, 451 F.3d at 1089-90 ("[I]n considering reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, an employer must consider not only those contemporaneously available positions but also those that will become available within a reasonable period."). Accordingly, a reasonable jury could conclude that a rotational reassignment does not require a new bid position that implicates the CBA's seniority provision.
Moreover, Mr. Thomas submits evidence that a permanent reassignment does not necessarily conflict with the CBA's seniority provision. The CBA authorizes requests for "permanent reassignment to light duty or other assignment ... if the employee is permanently unable to perform all or part of the assigned duties." (CBA, Art. 13, § 2.B.) While such an "assignment shall not be made to the detriment of any full-time regular on a scheduled assignment," there is no evidence in the record that Mr. Thomas would displace full-time regular career employees if he rotated among various departments. Nor would a rotational light-duty position in and of itself violate the CBA. The CBA states that "to provide maximum full-time employment and provide necessary flexibility, management [*28]  may establish full-time schedule assignments by including work within different crafts or occupational groups." (Id., Art. 7, § 2.A.) Based on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that a permanent reassignment to light-duty, rotational work is not unreasonable.
The Postmaster General again contends that even if the CBA does not bar the requested reassignment, USPS is under no obligation to create even a non-bid rotational position. (Mot. at 13-14; Reply at 4.) Even if this is true, the Postmaster General must submit evidence to show that a non-bid rotational position imposes undue financial or administrative burdens or requires a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program. He has not produced any such evidence here.6 Because the Postmaster General has not met his burden of showing that a rotational position creates an undue hardship, summary judgment is not appropriate.
Accordingly, Mr. Thomas has sufficiently raised triable issues on whether he can perform the essential functions of his job and whether his requested accommodations were reasonable. Accordingly, a jury, rather than the Court, must determine whether Mr. Thomas is otherwise qualified for employment.

2. Adverse [*29]  Employment Action Because of Disability
The third prong of a disability discrimination claim requires a plaintiff to show that he or she "suffered discrimination because of [his or] her disability." Walton, 492 F.3d at 1005. Discrimination occurs when an employer fails to "mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 U.S.C. § 791(f).
The Postmaster General argues that Mr. Thomas is unable to prove this element because USPS reasonably accommodated him with extended FMLA leave. (Mot. at 15.) Citing to Zivkovic v. So. Cal. Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080 (9th Cir. 2022), the Postmaster General contends that USPS had no duty to provide the exact accommodation that Mr. Thomas requested. (Id.) Instead, USPS reasonably believed that extended medical leave was the only reasonable long-term accommodation it could provide as Mr. Thomas had stated that he could no longer work in Automation. (Id.) Mr. Thomas responds that extended FMLA leave was unreasonable because he did not request it as an accommodation. (Opp'n at 19-20.) He further argues that extended leave was pretextual because he was forced to leave. (Id.)
The Postmaster General correctly notes that "[a]n employer is not [*30]  obligated to provide an employee the accommodation he requests or prefers" and "need only provide some reasonable accommodation." Zivkovic, 302 F.3d at 1089. "[A]n extended medical leave, or an extension of an existing leave period, may be a reasonable accommodation if does not pose an undue hardship on the employer." Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 1999). However, while "an employer has discretion to choose among effective modifications, ... an employer cannot satisfy its obligations under the [Rehabilitation Act] by providing an ineffective modification." U.S. E.E.O.C. v. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, 620 F.3d 1103, 1113 (9th Cir. 2010). An "employer has a duty to gather sufficient information from the [employee] and qualified experts as needed to determine what accommodations are necessary to enable the [employee] to perform the job." Buckingham, 998 F.2d at 740 (emphasis in original).
Here, the parties dispute whether Mr. Thomas's supervisors at USPS understood his medical restrictions. Ms. McKinney declares that she offered extended FMLA leave because she believed that the only other way to accommodate Mr. Thomas's disability was to "limit him to one hour of standing work per day," which he refused. (McKinney Decl. ¶ 16.) She and Ms. Dominguez believed that Mr. Thomas could only perform standing work for one hour per day or strictly "sit-down work," and the Automation [*31]  department did not have sit-down work available. (Id.; Dominguez Depo. 75:9-19; Dominguez Decl. ¶ 8.) Mr. Thomas argues that Ms. McKinney and Ms. Dominguez misconstrued his restrictions to require only one hour of standing work per day when they allowed him to stand intermittently for more than one hour per day. (Opp'n at 6-7.) He submits his physician's note, which states, "No prolonged standing or walking activities more than 1 hour without a 15 minute break to sit and rest." ("Physician Certification," Thomas Decl., Ex. B at 7.) Mr. Thomas's physician further certifies that Mr. Thomas may perform most tasks for up to eight hours a day. (Fenison Certification No. 1 at 47; Fenison Certification No. 2 at 53; PSUF ¶¶ 89, 108.) Ms. Dominguez also acknowledged in her deposition that Mr. Thomas's medical documentation did not expressly state that he could only perform sit-down work. (Dominguez Depo. 75:20-22.)
The Court finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists. Under the above evidence, a reasonable jury may find that Ms. McKinney and Ms. Dominguez misunderstood Mr. Thomas's medical restrictions and provided an ineffective modification based on inaccurate information. Therefore, [*32]  a reasonable jury could conclude that extended FMLA was unreasonable and that USPS failed to accommodate Mr. Thomas.
In sum, because Mr. Thomas has raised triable issues on each element of his prima facie case of disability discrimination, the Court DENIES the Motion as to Claim One.

B. Harassment (Claim Two)
In Claim Two, Mr. Thomas alleges that USPS subjected him to harassment based on his disability. (FAC ¶¶ 67-74.) Specifically, he alleges that he was "ostracized, singled out, labelled as the 'guy with a limp,' prevented from working his contracted eight (8) hour shift," prevented from using a chair, subjected to retaliation, "ignored" and "dismissed" by management, denied reasonable accommodations, and denied an opportunity to engage in a good faith interactive process with USPS. (Id. ¶ 70.)
As an initial matter, "it is not clear" whether a harassment cause of action is cognizable under the Rehabilitation Act. Anello v. Berryhill, 2020 WL 137109, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 13, 2020). Both parties only cite authority that analyzes harassment or hostile work environment claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. (Mot. at 15; Opp'n at 21.) The Court's own review fails to yield cases that are on point. Accordingly, absent direct precedent that recognizes harassment claims under the Rehabilitation Act, Claim Two cannot [*33]  proceed. The Court GRANTS the Motion and DISMISSES Claim Two.

C. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation (Claim Three)
In Claim Three, Mr. Thomas repeats his allegations under Claim One that USPS failed to provide him with reasonable accommodations. (FAC ¶¶ 75-82.) To the extent that Mr. Thomas asserts a failure to accommodate based on his requested reassignments, the Court finds that his claim survives summary judgment for the reasons discussed above. Similarly, to the extent that the Postmaster General argues that USPS accommodated Mr. Thomas with extended FMLA leave, this argument also fails because genuine disputes exist regarding whether this accommodation was reasonable. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion on Claim Three.

D. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process (Claim Four)
In Claim Four, Mr. Thomas alleges that USPS failed to engage in the interactive process with him. (FAC ¶¶ 83-90.) The Postmaster General argues that this claim fails because USPS accommodated Mr. Thomas with temporary light-duty in Manual Letters and extended FMLA leave and properly engaged in the interactive process. (Mot. at 17-18.)
"[O]nce an employee requests an accommodation ... , the employer [*34]  must engage in an interactive process with the employee to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation." Zivkovich, 302 F.3d at 1089. "The interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations." Humphrey v. Mem. Hosp. Assp'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001); Barnett v. US Air, Inc., 288 F.3d 1105, 1114-15 (9th Cir. 2000), vacated on other grounds sub nom., US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391 (2002) ("Both sides must communicate directly, exchange essential information and neither side can delay or obstruct the process."). This process allows the employer and employee to "come to understand the employee's abilities and limitations, the employer's needs for various positions, and a possible middle ground for accommodation the employee." Snapp v. United Transp. Union, 889 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 2018). The employer's obligation to engage is "mandatory." Anthony v. Trax Int'l Corp., 955 F.3d 1123, 1134 (9th Cir. 2020). It also "extends beyond the first attempt at accommodation and continues when the employee asks for a different accommodation or where the employer is aware that the initial accommodation is failing and further accommodation is needed." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1138. "An employer cannot prevail at the summary judgment stage if there is a genuine dispute as to whether the employer engaged in good faith in the interactive process." Id. (quoting Barnett, 288 F.3d at 1116). "[I]f an employer fails to engage in good faith in the interactive process, the burden at the summary-judgment phase shifts [*35]  to the employer to prove the unavailability of a reasonable accommodation." Snapp, 889 F.3d at 1095.
The Court finds that material factual issues preclude a determination that USPS participated in the interactive process in good faith. First, the record contains conflicting evidence about whether Mr. Thomas's assignment to Manual Letters was due to the interactive process. According to the Postmaster General, Mr. Thomas completed his first light duty request on April 12, 2019 after he disclosed to Ms. McKinney, his manager, and his supervisor Robert Gil of his difficulty working in Automation and at Ms. McKinney's direction to submit the request. (DSUF ¶¶ 21-23; Thomas Decl. ¶ 17.) It is undisputed that Sonya Murray, another supervisor for Mr. Thomas, permitted Mr. Thomas to spend his shift in Manual Letters after this request. (DSUF ¶ 29; Thomas Depo. 115:14-116:2.) However, Ms. McKinney declares that she did not authorize Mr. Thomas to work in Manual Letters and only learned "after-the-fact that he had been spending his full eight-hour shift in the manual letters department after he turned in his first light duty request." (McKinney Decl. ¶ 18.) In addition, she declares that reassignment to Manual Letters [*36]  is an unreasonable accommodation because full-time work is unavailable. (Id. ¶ 19.) A reasonable jury viewing these facts in Mr. Thomas's favor may conclude that USPS failed to communicate with Mr. Thomas when it allowed him to work in Manual Letters.
Second, the parties dispute whether USPS engaged in a good faith interactive process when Ms. McKinney placed Mr. Thomas on extended FMLA leave in May 2019. On the one hand, the Postmaster General submits evidence that Ms. McKinney interacted with Mr. Thomas during his assignment in Manual Letters to check for updates to his restrictions. (Id. ¶ 15.) She declares that she gave Mr. Thomas paperwork to request FMLA leave only after Mr. Thomas failed to provide updated restrictions requests and told her that he could not afford to work only one hour per day. (Id. ¶ 16; DSUF ¶¶ 34-36, 38.) On the other hand, and as noted above, there is evidence that Ms. McKinney misunderstood Mr. Thomas's medical restrictions. Mr. Thomas also declares that the extended FMLA leave was involuntary and that Ms. McKinney told him to clock-out and not return to work until his doctor changed his restrictions. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 42.) On this record, a reasonable jury [*37]  could find that USPS did not "consult[] and cooperate[] with Plaintiff such that the parties could discover Plaintiff's precise limitations and effective accommodations." Aki v. Univ. of Cal. Lawrence Berkeley Nat'l Lab., 74 F. Supp. 3d 1163, 1177-78 (N.D. Cal. 2014).
Third, Mr. Thomas submits sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue on whether USPS engaged in the August 6, 2019 meeting with him and the District Reasonable Accommodations Committee ("DRAC") in good faith. The Postmaster General argues that the existence of this meeting demonstrates good faith. (Mot. at 18.) He cites the declarations of Ms. Dominguez and Ms. McKinney, who state that "the committee discussed with Mr. Thomas his workplace restrictions, the essential functions of his position in Automation, and recommended that Mr. Thomas utilize e-reassign to apply for alternate positions." (DSUF ¶¶ 55-56; McKinney Decl. ¶ 25; Dominguez Decl. ¶ 6.) However, Mr. Thomas claims that DRAC never discussed his requested accommodations during the meeting. (Opp'n at 24.) He declares that even though he had informed the committee members that he could work in Manual Letters and Nixies, they never discussed his requested reassignment, told him to apply for bid positions on the E-Reassign website, and closed his case. (Thomas [*38]  Decl. ¶¶ 74-85; Dominguez Depo. 43:20-23, 81:3-5, 95:22-96:2.) Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Thomas, a reasonable jury could find that USPS failed to help Mr. Thomas identify potential accommodations. See Aki, 74 F. Supp. 3d at 1177-78 (finding material dispute where employer only discussed one of employee's restrictions during meeting and "there was absolutely no discussion nor exploration of other work options").
Finally, the Postmaster General fails to demonstrate that USPS continued to engage with Mr. Thomas after the August 6, 2019 meeting. During the meeting, DRAC advised Mr. Thomas to submit an updated physician's certification after his current one expired on August 31, 2019. (Dominguez Decl. ¶ 15.) However, there is no evidence that DRAC, Ms. McKinney, or Ms. Dominguez followed up with Mr. Thomas on or after August 31, 2019. A reasonable jury could find that USPS should have followed up with Mr. Thomas because it "was under a continuing duty to offer a reasonable accommodation." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139.
Taken together, the Court cannot conclude that USPS participated in the interactive process in good faith as a matter of law. Therefore, the burden shifts to the Postmaster General to prove that a reasonable [*39]  accommodation was unavailable. As discussed above, genuine issues of material fact exist on this question. Accordingly, the Court is unable to grant summary judgment and DENIES the Motion on Claim Four.

E. Retaliation (Claim Five)
In Claim Five, Mr. Thomas alleges that USPS retaliated against him for filing complaints, including by removing a high-backed chair that he had used in Manual Letters, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12203. (FAC ¶¶ 91-97.) The Postmaster General argues that Mr. Thomas cannot prove that the removal of the chair was retaliatory. (Mot. at 18-19.)
Under the ADA's retaliation clause, "a prima facie case of retaliation requires a plaintiff to show: (1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link between the two." Alvarado v. Cajun Op. Co., 588 F.3d 1261, 1269 (9th Cir. 2009). Only the second and third elements are at issue here.

1. Adverse Employment Action
The Postmaster General first contends that a chair removal is not an adverse employment action because it does "not influence Plaintiff's pay, job title, promotion opportunities or performance evaluations." (Mot. at 19.) This misstates the law.
In the Ninth Circuit, "a wide array of disadvantageous changes in the workplace constitute adverse employment [*40]  actions." Ray v. Henderson, 217 F.3d 1234, 1240 (9th Cir. 2000); Brooks v. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist., 1 F. Supp. 3d 1029, 1037 (C.D. Cal. 2014) ("The Ninth Circuit takes an expansive view of the types of action that qualify as an adverse employment action."). Actions may be adverse even if they do not "materially affect the terms and conditions of employment." Ray, 217 F.3d at 1242. The test is whether an action "is reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in protected activity." Id. at 1243. Of course, "not every disagreeable workplace action constitutes retaliation; rather, retaliation must produce an injury or harm." Hellman v. Weisberg, 360 F. App'x 776, 778 (9th Cir. 2009). "Context matters." Yonemoto v. McDonald, 114 F. Supp. 3d 1067, 1103 (D. Haw. 2015) (quoting Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 69 (2006)).
Here, the Postmaster General does not submit any proof in support of his assertion that the chair removal was not adverse. By contrast, Mr. Thomas proffers evidence that he relied on the chair to work in Manual Letters because the chair accommodated his sciatica. (Thomas Decl. ¶¶ 29, 34; Thomas Depo. 85:23-86:14.) According to Mr. Thomas's deposition testimony, the chair does not cause him pain, unlike the rest bar that USPS provides in Manual Letters. (Thomas Depo. 86:4-14.) A reasonable jury could conclude that the removal of the chair was disadvantageous because it "depriv[ed] [Mr. Thomas] of previously available support services." Knox v. State of Indiana, 93 F.3d 1327, 1334 (7th Cir. 1996); Brown, 457 F. App'x at 672 (finding that supervisors potentially acted adversely [*41]  when they ignored plaintiff's requests for "a chair tailored to her medical restrictions, worsening her physical pain and creating a challenging work environment").
Moreover, Mr. Thomas testified that once Ms. McKinney told him to remove the chair, he found it "simpler" to stand rather than use the rest bar and that he "never complained about it." (Thomas Depo. 86:11-14.) Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Thomas, a reasonable jury could conclude that the chair removal was reasonably likely to deter Mr. Thomas from engaging in protected activity. Accordingly, the Postmaster General has failed to show that no reasonable jury could conclude that the removal of the chair from Manual Letters was an adverse employment action.

2. Causal Link
The Postmaster General next asserts that Mr. Thomas fails to show a causal link between the chair removal and his protected activity because the removal was a policy decision that affected all employees. (Mot. at 19.) The Postmaster General again mischaracterizes the standard.
"[R]etaliation claims brought under the Rehabilitation Act require but-for causation." Brooks, 1 F. Supp. 3d at 1037. "Courts have generally held that causation can be inferred from timing alone where the [*42]  adverse action follows closely on the heels of the protected activity." Lee v. Natomas Unified Sch. Dist., 93 F. Supp. 3d 1160, 1169 (E.D. Cal. 2015). "When an adverse action closely follows a complaint, retaliatory intent may be inferred." Id. "The plaintiff has the burden to present evidence that establishes a link between his protected activity and any adverse employment action." Aki, 74 f. Supp. 3d at 1180.
Here, Mr. Thomas declares that on or around April 12, 2019, he submitted a request for light-duty and reasonable accommodations to Ms. McKinney and Ms. Murray. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 17.) That same day, Ms. Murray authorized him to work in Manual Letters. (Id. ¶ 21.) Mr. Thomas further declares that three days later, starting on April 15, 2019, Ms. McKinney began to ask him daily when he "was going back to the doctor to change [his] orders." (Id. ¶ 27.) On April 16, 2019, Mr. Thomas noticed that a regular armchair was missing from Manual Letters and a stool was in its place at his workplace. (Id. ¶ 34.) In this scenario, only a few days' time passed between his request and the chair removal. See Lazcano, 468 F. Supp. 2d at 1170 (noting that the Ninth Circuit has held that "three to eight months is easily within a time range that can support an inference of retaliation" (quoting Coszalter v. City of Salem, 320 F.3d 968, 977-78 (9th Cir. 2003))). Moreover, Mr. Thomas testified in [*43]  his deposition that the missing chair had been in that area since 2014 and that such chairs were "always available." (Thomas Depo. 42:9-19.) He further declares that when he retrieved a replacement chair on April 16, 2019, Ms. McKinney approached him and told him that chairs were not allowed in Manual Letters and to return the chair. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 34.) A reasonable jury could find from this evidence that Ms. McKinney was responsible for the chair removal and held a retaliatory motive. Accordingly, Mr. Thomas has presented sufficient evidence of a causal link between the chair removal and his light-duty request and established a prima facie case of retaliation.

3. Non-Retaliatory Reason
"If the employee establishes a prima facie case, the employee will avoid summary judgment unless the employer offers legitimate reasons for the adverse employment action, whereupon the burden shifts back to the employee to demonstrate a triable issue of fact as to whether such reasons are pretextual." Pardi v. Kaiser Found. Hosp., 389 F.3d 840, 849 (9th Cir. 2004). "Defendants 'need only produce admissible evidence which would allow the trier of fact rationally to conclude that the ... decision had not been motivated by discriminatory animus.'" Lee, 93 F. Supp. 3d at 1169 (quoting Miller v. Fairchild Indus., Inc., 797 F.2d 727, 731 (9th Cir. 1986)).
The Court [*44]  finds that the Postmaster General has met this burden. Ms. McKinney declares that one month after she started her position as Acting Manager of Operations Distribution, Senior Plant Manager Jeff Vibbert ordered all clerk employees not to use armchairs in Manual Letters. (McKinney Decl. ¶ 20.) Mr. Vibbert ordered the Moreno Valley Branch to remove armchairs from the workroom due to safety hazards identified during a safety committee review. (Id. ¶ 21.) The record contains no indication that Mr. Vibbert supervised Mr. Thomas or otherwise knew Mr. Thomas. Together, this evidence is sufficient for a jury to conclude that the chair removal was motivated by USPS management's review of the facility, rather than Mr. Thomas's request. Therefore, the burden shifts back to Mr. Thomas to demonstrate pretext.

4. Pretext
"To defeat summary judgment with a showing of pretext, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) the defendant's proffered non-retaliatory reason for the adverse action is unworthy of credence; or (2) retaliation was the more likely motivation." Brooks, 1 F. Supp. 3d at 1038. The plaintiff need not "introduce evidence beyond that already offered to establish their prima facie case, although they may provide additional [*45]  proof of the defendants' unlawful motivation." Lee, 93 F. Supp. 3d at 1170.
Here, Mr. Thomas produces evidence that even after the chair from Manual Letters was removed, other chairs remained available for other employees on different tours within the Moreno Valley facility. (PSGD ¶ 62; Thomas Decl. ¶¶ 31-32.) He declares that he directly observed another employee using a chair from April 2019 through May 2019. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 33.) The Postmaster General contends that this evidence fails to show that the chair removal policy was pretextual. (Reply at 9.) Citing to Ms. McKinney's declaration, the Postmaster General notes that the USPS replaced the chair with a rest bar in Manual Letters, which shows that it was motivated by safety. (Id.; McKinney Decl. ¶ 22.) Similarly, he asserts that USPS did not remove all chairs from the facility because only some in specific departments posed a specific risk. (Reply at 9.) However, this statement lacks any evidentiary support. Moreover, it is contradicted by the USPS's own assertion that "[t]he Postal Service has never been allowed to utilize chairs ... on the workmen floor." (Burrelle Decl., Ex. B.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Mr. Thomas has raised a triable issue [*46]  of fact on whether USPS's proffered reason for the chair removal in Manual Letters was pretextual. The Court DENIES the Motion on Claim Five.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART the Motion and DISMISSES Claim Two. The Court DENIES the Motion as to Claims One, Three, Four, and Five.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
