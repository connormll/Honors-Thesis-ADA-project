Opinion



MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
Before the Court are Defendant Unum Group's ("Defendant") motion to strike Plaintiff Jackie Waddle's demand for a jury trial (Doc. 17) and Defendant's partial motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (Doc. 19). For the reasons stated hereafter, Defendant's motion to strike is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and Defendant's partial motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

I. BACKGROUND
On April 13, 2017, Plaintiff initiated the instant lawsuit against Defendant by filing her complaint. (Doc. 1.) In her initial complaint, Plaintiff asserted claims against Defendant for: (1) violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA"); (2) unjust enrichment; and (3) violations of the Americans [*2]  with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). (Id.) On May 10, 2017, Defendant filed its answer and first partial motion to dismiss. (Docs. 4, 6.) In its first partial motion to dismiss, Defendant argued that Plaintiff's ADA claims should be dismissed because Plaintiff had not received a right-to-sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC").1 On June 6, 2017, Plaintiff obtained a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC and, as a result, the parties entered into a stipulation withdrawing Defendant's partial motion to dismiss. (See Doc. 13.) On June 19, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion to amend her complaint, "to more fully state a claim for relief under federal law." (Doc. 12.) The Court granted Plaintiff's motion on June 21, 2017, and she filed her amended complaint that same day. (Doc. 15.) On July 5, 2017, Defendant filed two motions: (1) a motion to strike Plaintiff's demand for a jury trial (Doc 17); and (2) a second partial motion to dismiss, arguing that Plaintiff failed to state a claim under the ADA (Doc. 19). Defendant's motions are now ripe for the Court's review.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
According to Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff's complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the [*3]  claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Though the statement need not contain detailed factual allegations, it must contain "factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Rule 8 "demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Id.
A defendant may obtain dismissal of a claim that fails to satisfy Rule 8 by filing a motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court considers not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the facts permit the court to infer "more than the mere possibility of misconduct." Id. at 679. For purposes of this determination, the Court construes the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and assumes the veracity of all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint. Thurman v. Pfizer, Inc., 484 F.3d 855, 859 (6th Cir. 2007). This assumption of veracity, however, does not extend to bare assertions of legal conclusions, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679, nor is the Court "bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation." Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986).
After sorting the factual allegations from the legal conclusions, the Court next considers whether the factual allegations, if true, would support a claim entitling the [*4]  plaintiff to relief. Thurman, 484 F.3d at 859. This factual matter must "state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). Plausibility "is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). "[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not 'show[n]'—'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Id. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).

III. ANALYSIS

A. Motion to Strike
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38(b) provides, in relevant part, that "a party may demand a jury trial by . . . serving the other part[y] with a written demand . . . no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served." Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(b). Failure to timely demand a jury trial may result in waiver. Irvin v. Airco Carbide, 837 F.2d 724, 727 (6th Cir. 1987). However, an amended complaint containing a demand for a jury trial may cure a timeliness issue if it raises "new issues permitting the plaintiff to seek a trial by jury on [those] newly raised issues." AMC Demolition Specialists, Inc. v. Bechtel Jacobs Co., LLC, No. 3:04-CV-466, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50679, 2005 WL 3240576, at *2 (E.D. Tenn. Nov. 30, 2005). The phrase "new issues" refers to issues of fact, not of law.  [*5]  Pro2Serve Prof'l Project Servs., Inc. v. BWXT Y-12, LLC, No. 3:07-CV-336, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49002, 2009 WL 1636256, at *5 (E.D. Tenn. June 11, 2009) (citing Las Vegas Sun, Inc. v. Summa Corp., 610 F.2d 614, 620 n.5 (9th Cir. 1979)). Restating previously raised factual issues will not revive a demand for a jury trial that has already been waived. See Irvin, 837 F.2d at 727 ("The fact that an amended complaint was later filed is of no consequence when no new issues or facts are introduced."); Pro2Serve, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49002, 2009 WL 1636256, at *5 ("[T]here is no jury trial as of right when an amendment introduces essentially no new facts to a case.").
Under Rule 39(b), "the court may, on motion, order a jury trial on any issue for which a jury might have been demanded." Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(b). Rule 39(b) vests broad discretion in district courts to order a jury trial even when the demand was untimely. Kitchen v. Chippewa Valley Sch., 825 F.2d 1004, 1013 (6th Cir. 1987). "The court's discretion should be exercised in favor of granting a jury trial in the absence of strong and compelling reasons to the contrary." Id. (quoting Local 783 v. Gen. Elec. Co., 471 F.2d 751, 755 (6th Cir. 1973)). Whether there will be discernible prejudice to the nonmovant is often a decisive factor. See Moody v. Pepsi-Cola Metro. Bottling Co., 915 F.2d 201, 207 (6th Cir. 1990) (affirming district court's granting of late demand for jury trial when nonmovant offered only "generic" prejudice argument).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's demand for a jury trial should be stricken because it was untimely filed. (Doc. 18, at 2-3.) Specifically, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's original complaint did not demand a jury trial and that the demand [*6]  included in her amended complaint cannot cure the timeliness issue because it fails to introduce "new facts which differ in any material way from those alleged in the original [c]omplaint." (Id. at 3). Plaintiff contends that she filed the original complaint prior to receiving a right-to-sue letter to "get the ball rolling" but did not intend to waive a jury demand for her ADA claim.2 (Id.)
Plaintiff's initial complaint, filed on April 13, 2017, did not include a demand for a jury trial. (Doc. 1.) Defendant answered on May 10, 2017, and did not demand a jury. (Doc. 4.) It was not until June 21, 2017, that Plaintiff made a demand for a jury trial in her amended complaint. (Doc. 15, at 5.) Plaintiff's demand was made more than fourteen days after "the last pleading directed to the issue [was] served," and is therefore untimely unless Plaintiff's amended complaint raises new factual issues. See AMC Demolition, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50679, 2005 WL 3240576, at *2. Based on the Court's review of Plaintiff's complaint and amended complaint, no new factual issues have been raised. Plaintiff's amended complaint is nearly identical to her original complaint, with the exception of some minor additions to her ADA claim. (Compare Doc. 1, at 3-4, with Doc. 15, at [*7]  3-4.) The Court agrees with Defendant that the majority of these additions were previously stated in other paragraphs of the complaint and that all "concern the same general area of dispute as was raised in the original pleadings." AMC Demolition, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50679, 2005 WL 3240576, at *2. Therefore, Plaintiff's demand for a jury trial is untimely under Rule 38(b).
However, the Court's inquiry does not end there. In the absence of any discernible prejudice to Defendant, the Court may still exercise its discretion under Rule 39(b) to grant a jury trial for Plaintiff's ADA claim. Moody, 915 F.2d at 207. Defendant does not identify any prejudice that would result from granting Plaintiff's untimely demand for a jury trial. (See generally Docs. 18, 25.) Following the Sixth Circuit's guidance, the Court finds that in the absence of any "strong and compelling reasons to the contrary," it should exercise its discretion in favor of granting a jury trial. Kitchen, 825 F.2d at 1013. Accordingly, the Court will DENY Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's demand for a jury trial with respect to her ADA claim.

B. Motion to Dismiss
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's ADA claims should be dismissed because she has not sufficiently pled her discrimination or retaliation claims under the ADA. (Doc. 20, at 4.) In response, Plaintiff [*8]  argues Defendant's partial motion to dismiss should be denied for the following reasons: (1) Rule 12(g) prohibits the motion because Defendant could have asserted its 12(b)(6) motion in its earlier partial motion to dismiss but failed to do so; (2) Rule 12(b) prohibits the motion because a Rule 12(b)(6) motion must be filed before filing an answer; (3) Defendant is fully aware of Plaintiff's medical condition; and (4) the amended complaint does state a claim for which relief may be granted. (Doc. 24, at 2-3.)
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(g) prohibits a party from making "another motion . . . raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g). Motions for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted are specifically exempted from Rule 12(g). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g)(2) & 12(h)(2). Thus, even if a party does not raise a 12(b)(6) motion in its motion to dismiss, it may still be raised in any pleading allowed under Rule 7(a), by a motion under Rule 12(c), or at trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(2). However, rather than raise its 12(b)(6) defense in a responsive pleading or 12(c) motion, Defendant has filed a second motion to dismiss. (Doc. 19.) For the sake of efficiency, the Court will construe Defendant's partial motion to dismiss as a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings. [*9] 3 See Satkowiak v. Bay Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, 47 F. App'x 376, 377 (6th Cir. 2002) (referring to party's mislabeling of motion as a 12(b)(6) rather than 12(c) as a "technical error [that] has no impact on [the court's] review"). The same standards apply to 12(b)(6) motions for failure to state a claim and 12(c) motions for judgment on the pleadings. Lindsay v. Yates, 498 F.3d 434, 438 (6th Cir. 2007).

i. ADA Discrimination Claim
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's amended complaint does not sufficiently plead that she is "disabled" under the ADA. (Doc. 20, at 4.) Specifically, Defendant argues, "[m]erely alleging that Plaintiff has a disability with no description of what that alleged disability is or how it substantially limits one or more major life activities does not state a claim for . . . disability discrimination." (Id.) (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiff contends her amended complaint does state a claim because she "alleges a disability which requires that she perform her job at home." (Doc. 24, at 3.)
To state a claim for disability discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff must allege that she "was disabled for the purposes of the ADA . . . and that Defendant wrongfully terminated her because of her disability."4  [*10] Benner v. Createc Corp., No. 1:08-CV-40, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46340, 2008 WL 2437726, at *3 (E.D. Tenn. June 13, 2008). The ADA defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102.
Plaintiff's amended complaint asserts that she "has a disability as defined by the ADA" and "[b]ecause of Plaintiff's disability, the nature of which is known to Defendant, Plaintiff had to work from home." (Doc. 15, at 3.) Plaintiff does not identify or describe her alleged disability out of privacy, in an effort "to avoid unnecessary public disclosure of [her] medical conditions." (Doc. 24, at 4.) The Court finds that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim of disability discrimination. Plaintiff's allegation that her disability caused her to have to work from home is not enough because, without identifying her disability, it is impossible to determine whether the alleged disability falls within the definition of disability under the ADA. See Davenport v. Sugar Mountain Retreat, Inc., No. 09-CV-0535-CVE-TLW, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98472, 2009 WL 3415240, at *2 (N.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2009) (granting 12(b)(6) motion where plaintiff's complaint asserted only that he was a "person with disabilities and/or [*11]  handicapped within the meaning of the [ADA]"). To determine if Plaintiff has stated a claim, it is necessary for her to allege sufficient facts concerning her disability, even if embarrassing or of a personal nature. "For sound reasons, a plaintiff is not permitted to proceed with a case unless [she] is willing to give up some of [her] privacy." Davenport, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98472, 2009 WL 3415240, at *3. Plaintiff's existing allegations are conclusory and, thus, do not satisfy the pleading requirements set forth in Twombly. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (holding courts are not bound to accept legal conclusions in a complaint as true when reviewing motion to dismiss). Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss with respect to the ADA discrimination claim is GRANTED. The Court will, however, grant Plaintiff leave to amend her complaint. See PR Diamonds, Inc. v. Chandler, 364 F.3d 671, 698, 91 Fed. Appx. 418 (6th Cir. 2004), abrogated on other grounds, 823 F.3d 1032 (6th Cir. 2012) ("When a motion to dismiss is granted in a case . . . the usual practice is to grant plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint.").

ii. ADA Retaliation Claim
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's amended complaint does not sufficiently plead a claim of retaliation under the ADA. (Doc. 20, at 6.) Specifically, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's amended complaint "does not assert any causal connection between [*12]  a protected activity and Plaintiff's termination" because Plaintiff "does not even allege when her employment with Defendant ended as compared to when she alleges she engaged in the protected activity." (Id.)
In order to state a claim for retaliation under the ADA, Plaintiff must allege that: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) the exercise of protected rights was known to Defendant; (3) Defendant thereafter took adverse employment action; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action Gill v. Rinker Materials Corp., No. 3:02-CV-13, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2986, 2003 WL 749911, at *3 (E.D. Tenn. Feb. 24, 2003). General allegations of retaliatory motivation will satisfy the "causal link" element. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) ("Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally."). "[A]lthough conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally, the plaintiff still must plead facts about the defendant's mental state, which, accepted as true, make the state-of-mind allegation plausible on its face." Mourad v. Marathon Petroleum Co. LP, 654 F. App'x 792, 798 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Republic Bank & Tr. Co. v. Bear Stearns & Co., Inc., 683 F.3d 239, 247 (6th Cir. 2012)); see also Khan v. Cook Cty., No. 96 C 1113, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10764, 1996 WL 432410, at *3 (N.D. Ill. July 30, 1996) ("Plaintiff has alleged that the transfers were in retaliation for his requests for accommodation. A causal link is adequately alleged.").
Plaintiff's amended complaint [*13]  alleges that Plaintiff requested a reasonable accommodation—to continue working from home—and that she supplied Defendant with a letter from her physician explaining the necessity for her requested accommodation. (Doc. 15, at 3.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant denied this accommodation and refused Plaintiff's repeated entreaties to engage in the interactive process to resolve the issue. (Id.) Finally, Plaintiff alleges she was unlawfully terminated "on account of her disability, in retaliation for her seeking a reasonable accommodation, and/or in retaliation for her asking for an interactive process to resolve the accommodation issue." (Id. at 4.) These allegations are sufficient to plead a claim for retaliation under the ADA. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss is DENIED with respect to the retaliation claim.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's demand for a jury trial (Doc. 17), and GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's partial motion to dismiss (Doc. 19). Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to a trial by jury on her ADA claim only. Plaintiff is GRANTED LEAVE to amend her complaint, [*14]  which must be filed within seven days of the date of this order.
SO ORDERED.
