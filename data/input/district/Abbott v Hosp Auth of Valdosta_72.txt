Opinion



ORDER
Pending before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 20). For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART.

I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff filed a Complaint on December 12, 2016, which was amended on December 21, 20161 , alleging that Defendant violated her rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008 (collectively, the "ADAAA"), and the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). (Docs. 1 & 5.) Thereafter, the Court granted Plaintiff's consent motion to dismiss Counts III and IV of the Complaint, alleging violations of the FMLA. (Doc. 19.) Counts I and II, alleging failure to accommodate and retaliation under the ADAAA, remain. Defendant [*2]  Hospital Authority of Valdosta and Lowndes County, Georgia d/b/a South Georgia Medical Center ("SGMC") timely filed a motion for summary judgment on October 12, 2017. (Doc. 20.) Plaintiff filed a response on November 3, 2017. (Doc. 21.)2 Defendant timely replied thereto. (Doc. 24.) Finding Plaintiff's three-sentence argument that genuine disputes of material fact exist insufficient, the Court ordered Plaintiff to supplement her response and allowed Defendant to file a supplemental reply. (Doc. 26.) A supplemental response and reply were filed. (Docs. 28 & 29.3 ) Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 20) is ripe for review. See M.D. Ga. L.R. 7.3.1(A).

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD

A. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56
"Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Chow v. Chak Yam Chau, 555 F. App'x 842, 846 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Maddox v. Stephens, 727 F.3d 1109, 1118 (11th Cir. 2013)). "'A genuine issue of material fact does not exist unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a reasonable jury to return a verdict in its favor.'" Grimes v. Miami Dade Cnty., 552 F. App'x 902, 904 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir. 2000)). "An issue of fact is [*3]  'material' if it is a legal element of the claim under the applicable substantive law which might affect the outcome of the case." Allen v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). "It is 'genuine' if the record taken as a whole could lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party." Tipton v. Bergrohr GMBH-Siegen, 965 F.2d 994, 998 (11th Cir. 1992) (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)).
The movant bears the initial burden of showing, by citing to the record, that there is no genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986); Barreto v. Davie Marketplace, LLC, 331 F. App'x 672, 673 (11th Cir. 2009). The movant can meet that burden by presenting evidence showing there is no dispute of material fact, or by demonstrating that the nonmoving party has failed to present evidence in support of some element of its case on which it bears the ultimate burden of proof. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-24. Once the movant has met its burden, the nonmoving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and identify "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Id. at 324. To avoid summary judgment, the nonmoving party must "do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.'" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586 (citations omitted). Instead, the non-movant must point to record evidence that would be admissible at trial. See Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, 683 F.3d 1283, 1294 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting Macuba v. Deboer, 193 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir. 1999)) (noting that hearsay may be considered on a motion for summary judgment only if [*4]  it "could be reduced to admissible evidence at trial or reduced to admissible form."). Such evidence may include affidavits or declarations that are based on personal knowledge of the affiant or declarant. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4).
On a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view all evidence and factual inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine whether that evidence could reasonably sustain a jury verdict. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587-88; Allen, 121 F.3d at 646. However, the Court must grant summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).

1. Local Rule 56
Local Rule 56 requires the following:
The respondent to a motion for summary judgment shall attach to the response a separate and concise statement of material facts, numbered separately, to which the respondent contends there exists a genuine issue to be tried. Response shall be made to each of the movant's numbered material facts. All material facts contained in the moving party's statement which are not specifically controverted by the respondent in respondent's statement shall be deemed to have been admitted, unless otherwise inappropriate.
M.D. Ga. L.R. 56. Here, Defendant properly filed a summary judgment motion [*5]  with a Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Local Rules of this Court. (See Doc. 20-2.) Plaintiff then filed a response to Defendant's statement of material facts and provided her own Statement of Material Facts to Which Plaintiff Contends There Exists a Genuine Dispute. (See Docs. 21-1 & 21-2.)4 Having established the applicable standards, the Court will proceed to the facts.

III. RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The following facts are derived from the Amended Complaint (Doc. 5); Defendant's Answer (Doc. 8); Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Doc. 20-2); Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Doc. 21-1); Statement of Material Facts to Which Plaintiff Contends There Exists a Genuine Dispute (Doc. 21-2); and the record in this case. Where relevant, the factual summary also contains undisputed and disputed facts derived from the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits, all of which are construed in a light most favorable to Virginia Abbott as the nonmoving party. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587-88.
Abbot began working as a Registered Nurse for Defendant in June of 1996. [*6]  (Doc. 5 ¶ 15.) Around 1999, Abbott was diagnosed with a seizure disorder, which is a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Id. ¶ 16-17. Abbott began working as a nurse in SGMC's Catherization Preparation and Recovery ("Cath Prep") Department, in the unit for cardiac outpatient procedures, on May 24, 2013. (Doc. 21-1 at 3 ¶ 4; Doc. 20-4 at 60 pp.16-17.) Laura Fiveash was one of Abbott's supervisors in Cath Prep, who has received ADA training from SGMC. Id. at 3 ¶ 5. As a nurse in Cath Prep, Abbott's duties involved providing patient care, assisting with patient procedures, documenting patient care, preparing patients for catherization, and assisting them during recovery, among other things. Id. at 3-4 ¶ 6. Abbott's duties also involved performing a medical procedure called "pulling the sheath," which involves a nurse removing a catheter "used to access the femoral artery for cardiac catherization from a patient's groin," and applying pressure to the groin until bleeding stops, which can take up to twenty minutes. Id. at 4 ¶ 7. Nurses typically perform a "pulling the sheath" procedure one or two times per day. Id. at 6 ¶ 10.5 In Cath Prep, generally [*7]  one nurse is assigned to two patients, and one or more nurses perform the pulling the sheath procedure. (Doc. 28-1 at 5.)6 Nurse stations are located in the interior of the Cath Prep department, with private patient rooms around the exterior of the department. (Doc. 21-1 at 5.)
On July 16, 2014, Abbott was sitting at a desk documenting patient care when she had a focal seizure, collapsed, and became unconscious. (Doc. 21-1 at 6-7 ¶ 12.) Fiveash was unaware that Abbott had a seizure condition until after Abbott's seizure on July 16, 2014. Id. at 8 ¶ 16.7 Fiveash was particularly concerned because for three to five minutes while Abbott was writing the documentation, no one around Abbott realized that her cognitive function had deteriorated; yet, the entire piece of paper on which Abbott was writing was "'gibberish' and 'illegible.'" Id. at 7 ¶¶ 13-14 (quoting Fiveash Dep. 66:1-9). After the seizure, SGMC required that Abbott obtain a release to return to work from her doctor. Id. at 8 ¶ 15. Although Fiveash gave Abbott a copy of the document on which she has been writing at the time of her seizure to show her doctor, Abbott never gave the copy to her doctor. Id. at 7-8 ¶ 14, 17. Abbott [*8]  provided a release from her primary care physician, but Fiveash requested a more detailed release by someone who was aware of Abbott's responsibilities in Cath Prep because Fiveash was concerned about patient safety and Abbott's well-being. Id. at 9 ¶¶ 18-19. Specifically, Fiveash was concerned that if Abbott was pulling a sheath on someone behind a curtain, had cognitive deterioration for three to five minutes, "by the time she hit the floor and collapsed, the patient would have bled out and actually could have died." Id. at 10 ¶ 20 (quoting Fiveash Dep. 97:13-18 & Bates Dep. 45:14-46:9). "Following the seizure incident, Abbott was required to always work with a coworker when pulling sheaths." Id. at 10 ¶ 21. Defendant is also aware of two incidents where Abbott administered medication incorrectly to patients, both before and after the seizure. Id. at 6, 12 ¶¶ 11, 26. Abbott spoke to Mindy Bates, Administrative Director of Human Resources, that she was being treated differently by her coworkers. (Docs. 28-9 ¶ 22; 20-4 at 23 p. 80:9-24.) Bates began investigating both Fiveash's and Abbott's concerns, and at an August 22 meeting, Abbott informed Bates that she wanted to return to her [*9]  current job. (Doc. 21-1 at 11 ¶¶ 22-23.)
On September 8, 2014, Alberta Graham in Human Resources provided Abbott's job description to Abbott's treating neurologist, Dr. Mahmood Eisa, for evaluation, noting specific concerns. (Doc. 21-1 at 11 ¶ 24.) Dr. Eisa responded with a letter stating that "the employee cannot perform the current job duties without any restrictions," stating in parentheses "'seizure precautions.'" Id. at 12 ¶ 25 (quoting Dep. Ex. 2 40:17-41:12). After Graham asked Dr. Eisa for clarification, Dr. Eisa responded that Abbott was able to perform all nursing duties with standard seizure precautions, including "'while working with patients, have another nurse present,'" not working long hours, and to "'[u]se common sense precautions . . . can be unpredictable as to when a seizure can occur.'" Id. at 13 ¶ 27. Fiveash interpreted Dr. Eisa's note to mean that Abbott would require a second nurse to be present whenever she was rendering patient care, and SGMC determined that Abbott's seizure disorder placed patients' safety at risk. Id. ¶ 29. Abbott disagreed with having to work "underneath" another nurse and was discourteous toward coworkers because of her anger about this [*10]  new restriction. Id. at 14 ¶ 31. Defendant asserts that following Dr. Eisa's note, Abbott had additional problems with coworkers and in treating patients, such that Fiveash perceived that Abbott was experiencing cognitive decline and behavioral changes and that Abbott's clinical performance was deteriorating. Id. at 15-16 ¶¶ 32-34. SGMC explored accommodation options but determined that it could not accommodate Abbott because it would be cost prohibitive to staff two nurses for Abbott's patients and that "Abbott could not perform her essential job duties with or without a reasonable accommodation." Id. at 17-18. Fiveash prepared disciplinary action reports regarding Abbott's poor clinical performance and workplace behavior, but she was recommended not to formalize them because employees could generally not transfer to another department if they had recent disciplinary reports. Id. at 19 ¶ 38. On September 25, 2014, Abbott was informed that SGMC could not accommodate her within Cath Prep, but that she would receive help in finding another job at SGMC. Id. at 20 ¶ 40. SGMC allowed Abbott to apply for more than the standard three positions, provided Abbott a job coach, and submitted applications [*11]  on her behalf. Id. ¶ 41.
Around November or December 2014, Dr. Eisa submitted an additional letter to SGMC, clarifying that Abbott should not work long hours and that "other nursing staff or additional support staff [should be] available while" Abbott was working. (Doc. 21-1 at 20 ¶ 40 n.1.) Although Dr. Eisa no longer required a second nurse be present, SGMC's patient care concerns remained and it was determined that Dr. Eisa's suggestion that Abbott only needed someone present somewhere in the department was not a reasonable accommodation for patient safety and business operations reasons. Id. As late as December 1, 2014, Abbott asked SGMC to return her to her position in the Cath Prep department without any restrictions or limitations. Id. at 22 ¶ 45. On December 8, 2014, Abbott was permitted to transfer to a new position as RN Diabetes Educator that Abbott previously agreed "sounded good." Id. ¶¶ 44, 46. On the same day she was transferred, Abbott was given a copy of her job description and signed it. Id. ¶ 46. The qualification for a Bachelor's Degree in Nursing was waived based on Abbott's nursing experience and because nurses with an Associate's degree had previously done well [*12]  in the position. Id. at 23 ¶ 47. The position of RN Diabetes Educator paid Abbott a higher salary and involved providing education to patients, including via initial assessments, offering classes, performing intake, and ordering medication and medical equipment. Id. at 24 ¶ 49, 51. Abbott spent the beginning of the time in her new position completing training and shadowing coworkers. Id. at 25-26 ¶¶ 52-55. Abbott did not have her own dedicated workspace, and when Abbott asked her new supervisor Dawn Taylor about having her own computer, Taylor informed Abbott that Abbott could use the front office computer and dietician's workspace when available. Id. at 26 ¶ 56. Thereafter, Abbott emptied a closet upstairs and created her own workspace with a hospital laptop she found. Id.
In late January 2015, Abbott was removed from the intake process after Dr. Jennifer Lawrence emailed Taylor to "not let Ginny do any intakes for my patients[;] I rather have no intake then [sic] misinformation." (Docs. 21-1 at 27 ¶ 57; 20-4 at 129.) Abbott asked everyday what her role was, and around this time, Taylor met with Abbott to discuss what her job entailed. (Doc. 21-1 at 28 ¶ 58.) On February 25, 2015, [*13]  Taylor prepared Abbott's ninety-day evaluation reflecting all twos and threes (out of five) and detailing Taylor's perceptions that Abbott had generally performed poorly. (Doc. 20-4 at 130-139.) On February 24, 2015, Abbott was placed on a thirty-day action plan, listing specific expectations that she must meet and was informed that failure to improve would result in a recommendation of termination of her employment. Id. at 140; (Doc. 21-1 at 30 ¶ 62.). Abbott responded to the evaluation with a lengthy rebuttal and a lengthy letter to Pam Cartwright in Clinical Services at SGMC, stating the deficiencies in training and lack of clear expectations within her new department, but not mentioning her seizure disorder. (Doc. 21-1 at 30 ¶ 61); (Doc. 20-4 at 147-151.) On March 3, 2015, Taylor provided Abbott an orientation checklist, which Taylor expected Abbott to complete in ninety days, and another copy of her job description. (Doc. 21-1 at 31 ¶ 64.)
On April 13, 2015, Abbott had another seizure at work. (Doc. 21-1 at 32 ¶ 66.) On April 22, Abbott submitted a note from Dr. Eisa stating that she could return to work on April 23 without limitations. Id. ¶ 67. Afterwards, Abbott was concerned [*14]  about working upstairs because her coworkers were downstairs. Id. at 33 ¶ 68. In May, Taylor informed Abbott twice that she could use the computer desk downstairs and emailed the staff asking them to refrain from using the computer when Abbott was using it. Id. ¶ 69. On May 13, Abbott wrote Taylor an email stating that the physicians expected more and deserved more than Abbott was able to give and that Abbott was not prepared to perform intake independently and needed more time and experience. Id. at 34 ¶ 71. Taylor responded that Abbott was expected to begin working as an RN Diabetes Educator by May 18, but Abbott refused to complete the orientation checklist prior to June 8. Id. at 34-35 ¶ 72. On May 14, 2015, Abbott was given a written warning disciplinary action report because she had incorrectly ordered medications to be filled and incorrectly documented a surgery and was warned that termination was possible if there were future performance issues. Id. at 35 ¶ 73. Dr. Lawrence informed Taylor that Abbott had complained that her skills did not fit the responsibilities of her new position, and staff members expressed their lack of confidence in Abbott's abilities to Taylor. Id. [*15]  at 36 ¶ 74. On May 26, Taylor met with Abbott and Human Resources and placed Abbott on a second action plan. Id. at 36 ¶ 75. Abbott was informed that she could either attempt to finish orientation or transfer and apply for a new position within SGMC. Id. at 37 ¶ 76. In late May, Abbott had two additional seizures, and Abbott provided a doctor's note stating that she could return to work on June 1 but not stating whether there were any work restrictions. Id. at 39 ¶ 80. After Abbott was unable to complete the orientation checklist, Taylor recommended to Human Resources that Abbott's employment be terminated. Id. at 40 ¶¶ 82-83. Abbott did not ask to transfer to a difference department, and on June 16, 2015, SGMC terminated Abbott's employment, which was upheld after Abbott appealed. Id. at 41 ¶ 84. Thereafter, Abbott applied for social security benefits, asserting that she was unable to work because of her disabling condition, and Abbott remains unemployed despite her efforts to find other work. Id. at 41-42 ¶¶ 85-87. On August 27, 2015, Abbott completed an intake questionnaire with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), and the EEOC received Abbott's Charge of Discrimination on January 14, 2016. Id. at 45-46 ¶¶ 94-95.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Whether Plaintiff's claims are time-barred
Plaintiffs suing under the ADA "must comply with the same procedural requirements to sue as exist under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." Zillyette v. Capital One Fin. Corp., 179 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir. 1999). Such plaintiffs must first exhaust administrative remedies by timely filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC before bringing suit. Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2001). In Georgia, a charge of discrimination with the EEOC is timely if filed within 180 days after the last discriminatory act. Id.; 29 C.F.R § 1601.13(a)(1).
SGMC argues that Plaintiff's claims are either (1) time-barred in whole because her verified Charge of Discrimination was filed more than 180 days after her termination or (2) time-barred in part as to all events occurring prior to February 28, 2015, which is six months before her unverified intake questionnaire was provided to the EEOC. (Doc. 20-1 at 3-4.) Plaintiff responds that Plaintiff's unverified intake questionnaire constituted a timely charge of discrimination because it was supplemented by a verification before the SGMC was required to respond. (Doc. 21 at 2.) Plaintiff further argues that her claims [*16]  on events occurring prior to February 28, 2015 are timely because of the Continuing Violation doctrine. (Doc. 28 at 3.)
The EEOC regulations require that a "charge" be in writing, signed, and verified. 29 C.F.R. § 1601.9 (2000). A charge is verified if it is "sworn to or affirmed before a notary public, designated representative of the Commission, or other person duly authorized by law to administer oaths and take acknowledgments, or supported by an unsworn declaration in writing under penalty of perjury." 29 C.F.R. § 1601.3(a) (2000). Although charges should contain certain specific information, "the EEOC will deem a charge minimally sufficient when it receives from the charging party 'a written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties, and to describe generally the action or practices complained of.'" Wilkerson, 270 F.3d at 1318 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1601.12(b)). A charge must also call the EEOC to action, that is "be reasonably construed as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employee's rights or otherwise settle a dispute between the employer and employee." Fed. Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U.S. 389, 402 (2008). Moreover, "[a] charge may be amended to cure technical defects or omissions, including failure to verify the charge," and "such amendments . . . will relate back to the date the charge [*17]  was first received." 29 C.F.R. § 1601.12(b); Hubbard v. Ga. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., No. 5:11-CV-290 (CAR), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45318, at *21 (M.D. Ga. Mar. 29, 2013) (finding that plaintiff cured the verification defect by subsequently filing a verified official charge and that such charge related back to plaintiff's questionnaire).
Here, Plaintiff provided an intake questionnaire to the EEOC within six months of her termination, alleging that SGMC discriminated against her on the basis of her seizure disorder disability and indicating that she wanted to file a charge of discrimination. (Doc. 20-4 at 197-200.) Courts have allowed unverified letters and statements in similar circumstances to constitute charges of discrimination. In Edelman, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the EEOC regulation permitting relation-back where an unverified letter timely submitted to the EEOC was followed by a charge of discrimination that was verified prior to the time the employer was required to respond to the charge. Edelman v. Lynchburg Coll., 535 U.S. 106, 109-15 (2002) (noting that the purpose of the time limitation is to protect employers from being forced to respond to frivolous claims, not to cause a lay complainant to forfeit her rights inadvertently). Likewise, in Godwin, the court found that by checking Box 2, which stated: "I want to file a charge of discrimination, and I authorize the EEOC to look [*18]  into the discrimination I described above[,]" plaintiff objectively manifested her intent that the EEOC activate its machinery and the remedial process. Godwin v. Mem'l Hosp. & Manor, No. 1:15-CV-140 (LJA), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51458, at *26-27 (M.D. Ga. Mar. 28, 2018); see also Fatz v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., No. 6:12-cv-1668-Orl-36DAB, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114055, at *30 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 13, 2013) (holding that Plaintiff's "verified Charge of Discrimination relates back to the filing of the Intake Questionnaire since the EEOC had not yet requested a response"). Here, Abbott also checked Box 2, containing the same language noted in Godwin, and nothing in the record indicates that the EEOC had asked Defendant to respond prior to Plaintiff filing her verified charge.8 Accordingly, Defendant is not due summary judgment based on its argument that Plaintiff's intake questionnaire was not a timely charge of discrimination.
SGMC alternatively argues that Plaintiff's claims are time-barred in part as to all events occurring prior to February 28, 2015, which is six months before her unverified intake questionnaire was provided to the EEOC. (Doc. 20-1 at 3-4.) Plaintiff responds that her claims on events occurring prior to February 28, 2015 are timely because of the continuing violation doctrine. (Doc. 28 at 3.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation by failing to engage in the interactive [*19]  process. (Id. at 5-8.) Plaintiff proposes that the Court apply the continuing violation doctrine to her failure to accommodate claims that result from Defendant's failure to engage in the interactive process. (Id. at 7 n.3.)
"Federal courts historically have applied the continuing-violation doctrine to permit a plaintiff to recover on an otherwise time-barred claim, where at least one of the violations she alleges occurred within the statutory limitations period." Abram v. Fulton Cty. Gov't, 598 F. App'x 672, 674 (11th Cir. 2015); Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113 (2002). (explaining that the doctrine is similar to equitable tolling or estoppel).9 The doctrine applies where an employer is alleged to have engaged in an ongoing unlawful employment practice and the alleged discriminatory acts are "plausibly or sufficiently related" to an act that falls within the charge filing period. Morgan, 536 U.S. at 114 (2002). However, the doctrine does not apply to discrete discriminatory acts committed by the employer, e.g. termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire, which are "easy to identify" as "a separate actionable 'unlawful employment practice.'" Id. at 114-15 (explaining that the doctrine applies to hostile work environment claims because a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own). The Eleventh [*20]  Circuit has limited the doctrine to apply only where "a reasonably prudent plaintiff would have been unable to determine that an unlawful act had occurred." Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Hamilton, 453 F.3d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir. 2006) ("'If an event or series of events should have alerted a reasonable person to act to assert his or her rights at the time of the violation, the victim cannot later rely on the continuing violation doctrine.'") (quoting Hipp v. Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co., 252 F.3d 1208, 1222 (11th Cir. 2001)). Therefore, the Court must determine whether the alleged discriminatory acts of SGMC are discrete acts and actionable on their own account, or continuous and not discrete such that a reasonably prudent person would not have known to assert her rights.
Employers must generally make a reasonable accommodation for a qualified person with a disability, and in determining a reasonable accommodation, it may be necessary for an employer to "initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3); Gilliard v. Ga. Dep't of Corr., 500 F. App'x 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (same). Plaintiff urges that the Court consider as an issue of first impression whether the continuing violation doctrine applies to her failure to accommodate claims based on Defendant's failure to engage in the interactive process. (Doc. 28 at 7 n.3.) Plaintiff argues [*21]  that Defendant's first discriminatory act for a failure to accommodate was transferring Plaintiff to the DMC on December 8, 2014. (Docs. 21-1 ¶¶ 44, 46 & 28 at 16-18.) Although Plaintiff initially thought the move "sounded good," (Doc. 21-1 ¶¶ 44,46), Plaintiff alleges that she soon learned that the DMC did not have a workspace for her, did not provide the tools necessary for the job, and failed to adequately train her for the job—and thus, failed to accommodate her disability. (Doc. 28 at 16-18.) Indeed, the job did not appear to be a demotion or other discrete adverse employment action because it paid a higher salary. Cf. Jordan v. City of Montgomery, 283 F. App'x 766, 767 (11th Cir. 2008) (explaining that a purported demotion is a discrete act of discrimination). Without addressing the merits of Plaintiff's claims, the Court finds that a reasonable juror may find on these disputed facts that a reasonably prudent plaintiff would not have known at the time of the transfer that she was being discriminated against such as to warrant asserting her rights. Though Plaintiff alleged that discrimination began following her seizure in June 2014 (Doc. 5 ¶ 20), Plaintiff now argues that her "attempts to procure an adequate accommodation from SGMC via the interactive [*22]  process began with the September 2014 notes from her neurologist and continued until well after February 28, 2015." (Doc. 28 at 8.) Accordingly, Plaintiff's claims of discriminatory acts occurring on and after September 8, 2014 will not be considered time-barred.10 SGMC's motion for summary judgment on the basis that Plaintiff's claims are time-barred is DENIED as to claims based on actions occurring on and after September 8, 2014.

B. Plaintiff's Failure-to-Accommodate Claim
Plaintiff alleges in Count I that Defendant violated the ADAAA by failing to accommodate Plaintiff's disability, and instead, terminating her employment within five months of her requesting a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 56 ¶¶ 104-122.) A Plaintiff may prove a Title VII violation through direct evidence of discriminatory intent or circumstantial evidence satisfying the burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Carter v. City of Miami, 870 F.2d 578, 581 (11th Cir. 1989).11 A review of Plaintiff's submissions does not reflect any direct evidence of discriminatory intent. Moorer v. City of Montgomery, 293 Fed. Appx. 684, 688 (11th Cir. 2008) (defining direct evidence as "evidence, which if believed, would prove the existence of a fact in issue without inference or presumption"). Therefore, the Court will apply the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. [*23]  See Cobb v. City of Roswell, Ga., 533 F. App'x 888, 893 (11th Cir. 2013).
Discrimination under the ADA includes a failure to accommodate by "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). Therefore, to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff must show that she: (1) has a disability; (2) is a qualified individual; and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination as a result of her disability. Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998). "Once the plaintiff has met her burden of proving that reasonable accommodations exist, the defendant-employer may present evidence that the plaintiff's requested accommodation imposes an undue hardship on the employer." Id. If the claimant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, a presumption of discrimination is created, and the burden of production shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action to rebut the presumption. Sims v. MVM, Inc., 704 F.3d 1327, 1332-33 (11th Cir. 2013). If the defendant produces such evidence, the plaintiff must persuade the court that the employer's stated reason is pretext for discrimination. Id.; Kragor, 702 F.3d at 1308. Thus, the Court must determine whether Plaintiff met her burden of establishing a prima [*24]  facie case, whether SGMC offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, and whether Plaintiff rebutted that reason by demonstrating that it was pretext for discrimination.
A disability is "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;" "a record of such an impairment;" or "being regarded as having such an impairment," because of an actual or perceived impairment. 42 U.S.C.S. § 12102(1)-(3). Because SGMC has already assumed for purposes of its motion that Abbott is disabled under the ADA (Doc. 20-1 at 5-6), the Court will move to the second prong of her prima facie case.
A "qualified individual" is someone who, "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "An employer must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with known disabilities unless such accommodations would result in undue hardship to the employer." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). "An accommodation is reasonable, and thus required under the ADA, only if it allows the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Id. "'Essential functions' are the fundamental job duties of a position [*25]  that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform." Id. "A job function also may be essential if there are a limited number of employees among whom performance of the job can be distributed." Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(ii)). Furthermore, in determining whether a function is essential, "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment ... and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
Defendant argues that Abbott is not a qualified individual because she could not perform an essential function of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 20-1.) First, Defendant asserts that Abbott could not perform the essential functions of her job without an accommodation based not only on Abbott's supervisor's opinion but on the opinion of Abbott's doctor who wrote: "No, the employee cannot perform the current job duties without any restrictions." Id. at .7 Defendant further argues that Plaintiff must demonstrate that a reasonable accommodation existed and that because Plaintiff never requested an accommodation in Cath Prep, [*26]  SGMC had no obligation to engage in the interactive process. Id. at 7-8. Defendant states that Abbott could not perform her job duties alone and that because it is not reasonable for an employer to hire another person to assist someone, SGMC could not provide a reasonable accommodation for Abbott in Cath Prep. Id. at 9. Defendant argues that SGMC did, however, accommodate Abbott by transferring her to the DMC in another role. Id. at 10. Plaintiff responds that her doctor did not state that another nurse must be with Abbott, only available, and that SGMC did not provide Abbott the reasonable accommodation of allowing her to work in Cath Prep with another nurse present in the department. (Doc. 28 at 11-12.)
It is undisputed that Abbott's role as a Staff Registered Nurse in Cath Prep involved providing various types of care to patients, including "performing and assisting with patient procedures, documenting patient care, preparing them for a catherization, [and] then receiving them after the catherization during their recovery." (Doc. 21-1 at 3-4.) The role also involved ''pulling the sheath," during which a nurse applies pressure and removes the sheath, "holding pressure on the patient's [*27]  groin until bleeding stops, which can take up to twenty minutes." Id. at 4. Each nurse performs the pulling the sheath procedure once or twice per day, and the patient remains at risk of bleeding for up to six to eight hours after the procedure. Id. at 6. Furthermore, Abbott signed a job description for this role in 2013 which stated that the Staff Registered Nurse "[p]erforms and assists with procedures," "administers medications as prescribed," and "initiates and/or maintains various catheters, tubes and drains." (Doc. 20-7 at 16-18.) Accordingly, the Court finds that these job duties, including pulling the sheath, are essential job functions for the role of Staff Registered Nurse in Cath Prep.12
Abbott now argues that she requested an accommodation by submitting her doctor's notes indicating that certain job restrictions should apply "even if she resented the restrictions and also inquired whether it was possible to return to the job without restriction." (Doc. 28 at 10.) Even taking this particular argument as true, Plaintiff has not shown that a reasonable accommodation existed.
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential [*28]  functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1366. "A plaintiff does not satisfy her initial burden by simply naming a preferred accommodation. . .; she must show that the accommodation is 'reasonable' given her situation." Terrell, 132 F.3d at 626. As Defendant argues, "[i]n a medical setting, the ability to ensure patient safety is, inherently, a component of every essential function of the job." (Doc. 29 at 6) (quoting Leme v. S. Baptist Hosp. of Fla., Inc., 248 F. Supp. 3d 1319, 1346 (M.D. Fla. 2017)) ("[C]ourts throughout the Eleventh Circuit have routinely deemed accommodations unreasonable where the accommodation did not enable employees in the medical field to perform the essential functions of their jobs and ensure patient safety."). Here, Plaintiff suffered from a seizure condition which, if consistent with the seizure she had at work on July 16, 2014, could cause significant cognitive deterioration for several minutes and unconsciousness. (See Doc. 21-1 at 6-7.)13 Further persuasive is that no one around Abbott noticed during her July 2014 seizure that her cognitive function had been deteriorating over several minutes. Id. Under such circumstances, it cannot genuinely be disputed, [*29]  and Plaintiff does not argue, that patients would not be safe if Abbott had a seizure while pulling the sheath behind a curtain and another nurse was merely present somewhere else in the department. In similar circumstances, plaintiffs were found to not be qualified individuals and their claims for disability discrimination failed. See, e.g., Gary v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., No. 4:03-CV-164(CDL), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46991, at *16-17 (M.D. Ga. Nov. 3, 2005) (finding a nurse not qualified because she had a back injury that prevented her from performing the essential function of physically responding to emergencies)14 ; Olsen v. Capital Region Med. Ctr., 713 F.3d 1149, 1154 (8th Cir. 2013) (affirming that plaintiff was not qualified because "[a]n essential function of [plaintiff's] job included insuring patient safety. Nothing in the record establishes [plaintiff[ could adequately perform that function during the indefinite periods in which she was incapacitated" while having a seizure); Haas v. Wyoming Valley Health Care Sys., 553 F. Supp. 2d 390, 393, 397 (M.D. Pa. 2008) (overturning jury verdict for the plaintiff in finding that no reasonable juror could find that surgeon with bipolar disorder was a threat to patient safety); Coleman v. Pa. State Police, 561 F. App'x 138, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2014) (affirming judgment for defendant which concluded that plaintiff's seizure disorder posed a significant threat).
The Court agrees with Defendant that strong patient safety and business operations concerns would arise if it [*30]  allowed Abbott to continue working under her requested accommodation of merely having another nurse present in the department. (Doc. 20-1 at 8-10); Olsen v. Capital Region Med. Ctr., 713 F.3d 1149, 1154 (8th Cir. 2013) ("The hospital need not subject its patients to potential physical and emotional trauma to comply with its duties under . . . the ADA.");15 Leme, 248 F. Supp. 3d at 1347 ("[T]he ADA does not require an employer to walk on a razor's edge—in jeopardy of violating the [ADA] if it fired such an employee, yet in jeopardy of being deemed negligent if it retained him and he hurt someone.") (citation omitted). Nor was Defendant required to staff a nurse to work alongside Abbott because doing so would likely present an undue hardship. EEOC v. St. Joesph's Hosp., Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19272, at *19 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 18, 2015) (disrupting employer's one-staff-member-to-two-clients ratio beyond the scope of a reasonable accommodation) (citing E.E.O.C. v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 148 (1st Cir. 1997)); Darwin v. Prinicpi, No. 6:04-cv-347-Orl-31DAB, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100729, at *37-38 (M.D. Fla. May 25, 2006) (employer "does not have a duty to provide another nurse or orderly just to enable Plaintiff do fulfill the responsibilities of a charge nurse"). "[E]mployers are only required to provide 'alternative employment opportunities reasonably available under the employer's existing policies.'" Terrell, 132 F.3d at 627 (quoting School Bd. Of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 289 n. 19 (1987)).
Plaintiff does not allege any other accommodations that would be reasonable and allow her to perform the essential functions of [*31]  her job in Cath Prep. Thus, the Court must conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Abbott was a qualified individual and that summary judgment is due to be granted on this claim because Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA. Likewise, Plaintiff does not argue that she requested an accommodation at the DMC, only that she complained about the inadequacy of her placement in the DMC. (See Doc. 28 at 11-12, 17.) Because Plaintiff has not shown that she requested a reasonable accommodation, the Court need not assess whether the employer engaged in an interactive process to find a reasonable accommodation or showed undue hardship from a potential accommodation. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 ("[W]here a plaintiff cannot demonstrate 'reasonable accommodation,' the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant . . . . [and] an employer has [no] duty to show undue hardship"). Thus, Plaintiff's failure to identify a reasonable accommodation is "fatal" to her failure-to-accommodate claim.16 Id. Summary judgment is therefore GRANTED to Defendant on Count I.

C. Plaintiff's Retaliation Claim
Plaintiff alleges in Count II [*32]  that "Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff by terminating her employment on the basis of her disability." (Doc. 5 ¶ 134.) The ADA's general anti-retaliation provision provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that she: (1) engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) established a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action. Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, then the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate nonretaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. Id. The plaintiff then must establish that the employer's proffered non-discriminatory reasons are pretext. Id.
Plaintiff asserts that after her July 2014 seizure, she requested to return to work without restriction17 and presented a doctor's note stating that she could not work without any restrictions and that "seizure precautions" should be in place such as to have another nurse present in the department. (See [*33]  Doc. 20-4 at 104-106, 119; Doc. 28-3 ¶ 6.) Thereafter, Human Resources sent Abbott a letter stating that SGMC "is unable to accommodate your medical restrictions" but will "assist you in finding a suitable position at SGMC that will accommodate your current work restrictions." (Doc. 20-4 at 107.) This letter indicates that Defendant recognized that Plaintiff had requested an accommodation due to her seizure condition. Such requests can be protected activity even if the accommodation is later determined to be unreasonable under the circumstances. See Standard, 161 F.3d at 1333 (holding that a request for accommodation for a back injury constitutes "statutorily protected activity" under the ADA if the employee "had a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that he was entitled to those accommodations under the ADA").18 Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable juror could find that she had a good faith, reasonable belief that she was being discriminated against given the numerous complaints and documentation she provided to Human Resources and her supervisors following her seizure suggesting disability discrimination, all of which are consistent with her EEOC charge and present lawsuit. [*34]  See Berman v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 160 F.3d 697, 702 (11th Cir. 1998) ("[I]t appears that, based on the comments regarding his religion and the transfers and reductions in his territory, he had a 'reasonable belief' that an unlawful employment practice was occurring.").19
Furthermore, Plaintiff asserts that after her job transfer to the DMC, unlike the other Diabetes Educators, she was not provided a dedicated workspace, computer, or telephone despite her requests, and her orientation was "scattershot," as she was frequently reassigned from one position to another such that she could not adequately learn her new job. (Doc. 28-3 ¶¶ 12-13.) Plaintiff complained about these and various other problems to Taylor, Pam Cartwright (the Director of DMC), and Mindy Bates of Human Resources, highlighting the efforts she had made to learn her new job and the challenges she was having because of the lack of guidance and resources. (Doc. 20-4 at 147-164, 169-179); (Doc. 20-4 at 26 pp. 92:11-107:24, 172.) Abbott complained to DMC Director Cartwright on March 17, 2015 and Taylor on May 13, 2015 about the problems encountered in the DMC and with Taylor and that she needed more from the DMC to be successful. (Doc. 20-4 at 147-151); (Doc. 20-4 at 172-178) ("I have repeated [*35]  [sic] expressed the need for the resources, working tools, guidance, application, and time . . ."). As Plaintiff argues, "[t]he next day, May 14, Ms. Abbott was formally disciplined, and, on May 26, she was assigned a[] [30-day] 'action plan'" that she was unable to complete because "she had a seizure on May 26 and was never allowed to return to work until her June 16 termination." (Doc. 28 at 19-20); (Doc. 28-1 at 35-41.) Plaintiff now argues that a reasonable jury could conclude that Abbott's complaints about her DMC position "were complaints about the inadequacy of the alleged accommodation and, thus, an attempt to continue the interactive process" of obtaining a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 28 at 17.) This argument is supported by Defendant's letter to Plaintiff stating that it would transfer her to a new job to "accommodate [her] current work restrictions" and Defendant's current argument that it "accommodated Abbott by transferring her" to the DMC. (Doc. 20-4 at 107; Doc. 20-1 at 10.)20 Such activity could be considered statutorily protected activity for purposes of an ADA retaliation claim because the facts asserted in her complaints suggest that Abbott reasonably believed [*36]  that she was being discriminated against. See Pipkins v. City of Temple Terrace, Fla., 267 F.3d 1197, 1201 (11th Cir. 2001) ("Statutorily protected expression includes internal complaints of sexual harassment to superiors. . . ."); Shannon v. Bellsouth Telecomms., Inc., 292 F.3d 712, 715 n.2 (11th Cir. 2002) (protected activity includes informally voiced complaints to superiors) (quoting Rollins v. Fla. Dep't of Law Enforcement, 868 F.2d 397, 400 (11th Cir. 1989)). As such, the Court is satisfied that there is at least a genuine dispute of material fact that Plaintiff engaged in statutorily protected activity in Cath Prep and the DMC.
To demonstrate an adverse employment action, "a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse." Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006). An employment action is materially adverse if it is "objectively serious and tangible enough to alter [the employee's] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprive him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affect [] his or her status as an employee. . . ." Gupta, 212 F.3d at 588. Additionally, "[t]o prove a causal connection, [courts] require a plaintiff only to demonstrate that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated." Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 197 F. 3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999) (citation and quotation marks omitted). "[A] plaintiff satisfies this element if he provides sufficient evidence that the decision-maker became aware of the protected [*37]  conduct, and that there was close temporal proximity between this awareness and the adverse employment action." Id.
In her complaint and amended complaint, Plaintiff only challenges her employment termination as an act of retaliation. (Docs. 1 5 ¶ 134 & 5 ¶ 134.) On June 16, 2015, Plaintiff was terminated from her employment with Defendant. (Doc. 28-1 at 41.) It is well-established that termination is an adverse employment action. Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1298 (11th Cir. 2006) (finding that "[plaintiff's] termination is certainly an adverse employment action"); Satchel v. Sch. Bd., 251 F. App'x 626, 629 (11th Cir. 2007) (finding that employment termination constitutes an adverse employment action); Vaughan v. World Changers Church Int'l, Inc., No. 1:13-CV-0746-AT, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912, at *34 (N.D. Ga. Sep. 16, 2014) ("[T]here is no question [plaintiff's] termination is an adverse employment action"). In fact, Defendant does not even argue that Plaintiff's termination was not an adverse employment action. (See Docs. 20, 24, 29.) Thus, the Court finds that a reasonable juror could find that Abbott's termination was an adverse employment action.
Furthermore, Plaintiff asserts that she requested an accommodation as late as December 8, 2014, which is a little more than six months before she was terminated on June 16, 2015. (See Doc. 28 at 10.) The Court agrees with Defendant that six months is probably too long [*38]  standing alone to establish a causal connection. See, e,g., Summers v. Winter, 303 F. App'x 716, 720 (11th Cir. 2008) (finding that "a temporal proximity of several months . . . . was not very close"); Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 930 (11th Cir. 2010) (finding four to eight months too long); Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) ("A three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough[.]"). Where "the temporal proximity [i]s not very close, more evidence [i]s required to demonstrate the causal connection." Summers, 303 F. App'x at 720.
Plaintiff further argues that Defendant engaged in "a campaign of retaliation that began after Ms. Abbott requested an accommodation and culminated in her termination." (Doc. 28 at 18.) After Plaintiff submitted her alleged requests for accommodations on September 8 and 10, 2014 (Doc. 20-4 at 8, 10), Defendant placed her on unpaid medical leave for three months beginning around September 25, 2014. (See Doc. 20-4 at 57-61.)21 Then, on December 1, 2014, Abbott wrote a lengthy letter to Mindy Bates, the Human Resources Director, referencing a harassment handout and the mistreatment by her supervisor and co-workers she experienced after her seizure, including that for forty-five minutes she endured her supervisor's "hostel [sic], intimidating, harassment, [*39]  verbal abuse" and that she had kept records "to protect herself from any future harm that may occur [from] these events," and requesting to return to her job. (Doc. 20-4 at 112-119.) It was Bates who recommended the DMC position to Abbott, and just one week after this letter, on December 8, 2014, Abbott was assigned to the DMC by Human Resources. Although the role initially sounded good and paid a higher salary, Plaintiff now asserts that the transition was "essentially a 'Career Graveyard' - a place to send employees to transition them out of employment." (Doc. 28 at 17.) The position required a Bachelor's degree, which was waived for Abbott. (Doc. 28-1 at 23.) Furthermore, Plaintiff asserts that although Bates suggested the DMC position to Abbott, there was actually no opening in the DMC when Abbott was assigned to it, and Dawn Taylor, the supervisor in the DMC, told Abbott that she did not know Abbott was coming and there was no space for additional staff. (Doc. 20-4 at 66; Doc. 28-3 ¶¶ 10-11.) While the facts could suggest that Defendant was merely trying to accommodate Abbott, they could also suggest that Defendant was retaliating against Abbott for engaging in protected activity. [*40] 22
Additionally, Abbott complained to DMC Director Cartwright on March 17, 2015 and Taylor on May 13, 2015 about the problems encountered in the DMC and with Taylor and that she needed more from the DMC to be successful. (Doc. 20-4 at 147-151); (Doc. 20-4 at 172-178). On May 26, she was assigned a[] [30-day] 'action plan'" that she was unable to complete because she had a seizure on May 26 and did not to return to work until her June 16 termination. (Doc. 28 at 19-20); (Doc. 28-1 at 35-41.) Taylor recommended to Cartwright and Bates that Abbott's employment be terminated, and Bates agreed with the termination and subsequently upheld the termination after Abbott appealed. (Doc. 28-1 at 40-41.) These facts present a much closer temporal proximity between Plaintiff's last alleged acts of protected activity in May and her termination in June. See Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999) (finding that seven weeks constitutes a "close temporal proximity" and requiring no additional evidence of causation); Berman, 160 F.3d at 702 (finding prima facie case where adverse action occurred two months after protected activity). Further, these facts taken as a whole could allow a reasonable factfinder to find a causal connection between Plaintiff's protected [*41]  activity and termination because the same people to whom she had complained decided that she should be terminated. Therefore, the Court is satisfied that Plaintiff has met her burden on this element and established a prima facie case of retaliation based on her employment termination.

1. Defendant's Rebuttal & Plaintiff's Showing of Pretext
"Once the employee establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden of production is shifted to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." Sims v. MVM, Inc., 704 F.3d 1327, 1333 (11th Cir. 2013). If Defendant articulates "a clear and reasonably specific non-discriminatory basis for its actions," Plaintiff must then show by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant's stated reasons are pretext for discrimination. Gordon v. Dooly County Sch. Dist., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37878, at *19, 2005 WL 3560659 (M.D. Ga. Dec. 28, 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (noting that Defendant's burden is a burden of production, not persuasion, which has been described as "exceedingly light") (citation omitted); accord Smith, 839 F.2d at 1538. To meet this burden, Plaintiff must show that the Defendant's stated reasons were pretext for discrimination "either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly [*42]  by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Turner v. Ga. Sec'y of State, 848 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1374 (M.D. Ga. Jan. 30, 2012) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Where the defendant has articulated more than one legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, "the plaintiff must rebut each of the reasons to survive summary judgment." Id. at 1375.
Defendant asserts that Abbott was terminated "based solely on her job performance" and "admitted inability to complete her orientation and demonstrate basic competency." (Doc. 20-1 at 18-19.) The Court agrees that poor performance is a recognized legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating an employee. See Wheatfall v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Georgia, 9 F. Supp. 3d 1342, 1361 (N.D. Ga. 2014) ("[The employer]...rebutted [plaintiff's] prima facie case by providing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for firing [her]: her continued poor job performance."). But, Plaintiff has raised myriad facts to suggest that this reason is false and that retaliation is the real reason. Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Group Inc., 509 F.3d 1344, 1348 (11th Cir. 2007).
All of the written disciplinary reports about Plaintiff came shortly after she engaged in alleged protected activity. Abbott's supervisor in Cath Prep prepared three reports against Abbott on September 23, 2014 (two weeks after she purportedly requested an accommodation), each reporting prior errors [*43]  or problems with Abbott's performance that occurred as early as July 14, 2014. (See Doc. 20-9 at 141, 143, 145.) Although Defendant asserts that the July 14 error was discovered after an audit, a reasonable juror could find that assertion untrue under the circumstances. In the DMC, following Abbott's requested January 2015 meeting with Taylor, during which Abbott alleges she informed Abbott of her seizure condition and requested additional resources and guidance (Doc. 28-9 ¶ 29), Taylor prepared Abbott's ninety-day evaluation reflecting all twos and threes out of five even though Abbott had not been in the DMC for ninety days. (Doc. 20-4 at 130-139.) On May 8, Taylor emailed Abbott stating that they have provided everything Abbott needs and to let her know if anything else is needed for Abbott to be successful. (Doc. 20-4 at 171.) Abbott responded on May 13 with a lengthy email explaining how she had been repeatedly asking for more guidance, resources, and time, telling Taylor "either your [sic] just not hearing the true meaning of what I'm saying or I feel you just don't care." Id. at 172-78. On May 14, Taylor immediately instructed Abbott to finish the orientation checklist in three [*44]  business days and then wrote a disciplinary report about Abbott based on prior errors. Id. at 179-180. The report stated that if there were future performance issues, the "[n]ext action will be suspension or possible termination." Id. at 180. Twelve days later, Abbott was placed on a 30-day action plan23 to complete the orientation checklist, but the same day, she had a seizure at work which caused her to be out for some time. (Doc. 28-1 at 36-40.) On June 16, less than 30 days after the new plan was provided, Abbott was terminated for failure to complete the checklist. Id. at 40-41.24 While a reasonable juror could agree with Defendant that Abbott's termination was justified based on Abbott's poor performance, a reasonable juror could also agree with Abbott that her placement in the DMC was intended to make her fail. Although Abbott later stated that she was not qualified for the job and that the doctors and patients deserved better (Doc. 28-1 at 37-38), these statements do not negate an inference of retaliation, especially when contextualized by Plaintiff's other testimony. (See, e.g., Doc. 20-4 at 45 pp. 166) ("I probably felt defeated. . . . If you cannot have a place to sit down, [*45]  if your job requires [] you do computer input, [but] you have no place to input that information. . . how can you succeed?"). An inference of pretext is further supported by Plaintiff's argument, which is supported by the record, that Plaintiff was well-regarded during her first eighteen years with the hospital and that the alleged job performance issues were all asserted after her July 2014 seizure and request for accommodations. (Doc. 28 at 18-19); Lawson, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1286 (finding that facts were sufficient to infer pretext where plaintiff had received good performance reviews during her prior twelve years and that the same decisionmaker was involved in her transfer and termination). Under these circumstances, and taking the facts in a light favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable juror could find that these reports were actually pretext for retaliation rather than legitimately based on Abbott's poor performance. See Vaughan v. World Changers Church Int'l, Inc., No. 1:13-CV-0746-AT, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912, at *38-39 (N.D. Ga. Sep. 16, 2014) (denying summary judgment because "a reasonable jury could infer that this laundry list of infractions was a bogus attempt, crafted sometime after" the disability arose, "to set [plaintiff] up for discharge the moment she committed even the smallest of infractions.")
In ruling on [*46]  a motion for summary judgment, the Court must determine "whether the evidence [submitted by Plaintiff] presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1282 (11th Cir. 1999). As Plaintiff asserts, "the plaintiff will always survive summary judgment if [she] presents circumstantial evidence that creates a triable issue concerning the discriminatory intent." Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011) (emphasis added). Here, Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to allow a jury to infer that her termination was actually unlawful retaliation. See id. (internal quotations omitted). Thus, Plaintiff has established a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendant's reasons are pretext for retaliation.
Accordingly, summary judgment is DENIED on Count II, Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

2. Available Relief
Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not entitled to compensatory or punitive damages on her ADA retaliation claim because the ADA does not authorize such relief. (Doc. 20-1 at 20) (citing Vaughan, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912). Plaintiff responds that because the Eleventh Circuit is silent on this issue, "this Court should look to the ADA's anti-retaliation provisions, which incorporate [*47]  its anti-discrimination provisions, which authorize the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages." (Doc. 28 at 20) (citing Rumler v. Dep't of Corr., 546 F. Supp. 2d 1334, 1339-43 (M.D. Fla. 2008)). That is essentially the whole of the Parties' arguments on this issue which appears to be unresolved by the Eleventh Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Parties are each ORDERED to file a supplemental brief of no more than five pages no later than Friday, October 5, 2018 arguing whether Plaintiff is entitled to compensatory or punitive damages for her retaliation claim and whether this case should be set for a jury trial or bench trial and providing support for their arguments. The Parties may each file a reply brief of no more than five pages no later than Friday, October 12, 2018.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 20) is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART. Summary judgment is GRANTED to Defendant on Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim (Count I), and is DENIED on Plaintiff's retaliation claim (Count II). This case will be set for trial by separate order as to Count II after the Court resolves the Parties' contentions regarding the relief that is available.
SO ORDERED, this 20th day of [*48]  September 2018.
