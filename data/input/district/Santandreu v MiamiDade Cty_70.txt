Opinion



ORDER
THIS CAUSE came before the Court on the Defendant, Miami Dade County's ("Miami Dade['s]") Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 14], filed March 17, 2011. The Court has carefully reviewed the parties' written submissions and applicable law.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Juan Santandreu ("Santandreu"), claims he became disabled as a result of the allegedly hostile work environment he experienced while employed for Miami Dade. (See Am. Compl. ¶ 9). This work environment caused Mr. Santandreu to develop "mental and psychological disorders, . . . a generalized anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and other medical conditions which worsened the longer he remained in the hostile work environment." (Id. ¶ 9). He asserts that as a result of the disorders, he is disabled, and he was discriminated against as a result of those disabilities. (See id. ¶¶ 10, 35).
Mr. Santandreu was employed by Miami Dade from June 2002 until he resigned [*2]  on June 21, 2007. (See Def.'s Statement of Material Facts ("SMF") ¶¶ 1, 18 [ECF No. 16] ). When he began working for Miami Dade in the Water and Sewer Department (the "Department"), Plaintiff's title was "Engineer I." (Id. ¶ 1). As an Engineer I, Mr. Santandreu prepared materials requisitions, obtained construction permits, revised shop drawings, and made preliminary cost estimates for projects. (See id.). In his first-year evaluation, Mr. Santandreu was rated "Satisfactory," with the caveat that because he was "in training as an Assistant Project Manager, his productivity was 'marginal.'" (Id. ¶ 3). Nevertheless, Plaintiff "passed the one-year probationary period and received a merit increase." (Id.).
During his tenure at the Department, Mr. Santandreu's supervisors changed. His first evaluation was performed by Amalia Suarez and George Aguiar. (See id.). Plaintiff contends this evaluation (rating him satisfactory) was improperly filled out. (See Pl.'s Statement of Material Facts in Opposition ("SMFO") ¶ 3 [ECF No. 32]). In early 2003, following Suarez's retirement, Mr. Santandreu was assigned to work under Aguiar and Victor Fernandez-Cuervo. (See SMF ¶ 4). The following year, in 2004, [*3]  Mr. Santandreu was supervised by Carlos Benavides1 and Nzeribe Ihekwaba. (See id. ¶ 5). Benavides and Ihekwaba rated Plaintiff as "Needs Improvement" for the period spanning January 17, 2004 through August 24, 2004. (Id.). Mr. Santandreu disagreed with this rating. (See id.; SMFO ¶ 5).
Benavides and Ihekwaba again evaluated Plaintiff for the period beginning January 19, 2004 and ending January 16, 2005. (See SMF ¶ 6). While Mr. Santandreu was rated "Satisfactory" overall, his "Quality of Work" was rated as "Needs Improvement." (Id.). Plaintiff was rated this way because he was "lacking basic design experience," was "still 'making mistakes in construction estimates and materials' requisition,'" and was "advised 'to concentrate more on his work.'" (Id.) (quoting Mot. Ex. 9 [ECF No. 16-2]). Mr. Santandreu again disagreed with this evaluation and expressed his thoughts in a written response. (See id.; SMFO ¶ 6).
Mr. Santandreu's supervisors did not change during the following year, and Benavides and Ihekwaba evaluated Plaintiff for the one-year period spanning January 17, 2005 through January 15, 2006. (See SMF ¶ 7). Benavides and Ihekwaba rated Plaintiff as "Needs Improvement" overall [*4]  for that year. (Id.). They found Mr. Santandreu still did not produce enough work, did not fully understand parts of his job, had not improved his design capability, continued to make mistakes, needed to concentrate more, failed to complete his work on time, did not use his time effectively, had not improved his interpersonal skills, and had difficulty understanding and accepting advice and counseling. (See id.). They encouraged Plaintiff to review his "Auto-Cad" notes, to possibly retake the "Auto-Cad" class, to take other related classes, and to concentrate more. (Id.). Plaintiff did not agree with this evaluation. (See id.; SMFO ¶ 7).
In addition, for three months out of that year, Mr. Santandreu worked under Jose Dominguez. (See SMF ¶ 7). Dominguez, in evaluating Plaintiff, rated his performance as "Unsatisfactory" in three of four categories. (Id.).
Mr. Santandreu requested a leave of absence due to "illness" on January 27, 2006, and Miami Dade approved the request. (See id. ¶ 8). Plaintiff now disputes that "the conditions were only regarded as an 'illness . . . .'" (SMFO ¶ 8). Mr. Santandreu never returned to work. (See id. ¶¶ 8-21). At the time this leave was initially requested, [*5]  Miami Dade asserts "neither Santandreu nor his supervisors was [sic] aware that he had a disability." (Id. ¶ 8).
When Mr. Santandreu's leave was close to expiring, he requested an extension to March 25, 2006, and then again to January 25, 2007. (See SMF ¶ 9). The Department granted both requests. (See id.).
While still on leave, Mr. Santandreu filed a complaint with the Department's Fair Employment Practices Office ("Department Complaint"). (See id. ¶ 10). In the Department Complaint, Mr. Santandreu alleged "retaliation," but did not further expound on the protected activity he had engaged in to cause the "retaliation." (Id.). While the Department's complaint form contains a box for "'Disability' discrimination," Mr. Santandreu did not "check" the box "because he was not aware at the time that he had a disability." (Id.). Mr. Santandreu now urges that his misunderstanding of the word "disability" should not be determinative of whether or not he had a disability. (SMFO ¶ 10). He asserts Miami Dade still regarded him as disabled. (See id.).
Moreover, the Department Complaint alleged that Benavides harassed Mr. Santandreu and created a hostile work environment because of his disability. [*6]  (See SMF ¶ 11). Miami Dade, however, asserts this alleged harassment occurred prior to the time that even Plaintiff knew he was disabled. (See id.). Further, Benavides never commented on Mr. Santandreu's possibly then-unknown disability. (See id.). And while Mr. Santandreu's Department Complaint alleged Benavides harassed other employees, no other employees are disabled. (See SMF ¶ 12). Miami Dade thus contends any harassment that occurred was not, and could not have been, based on Mr. Santandreu's disability. On the contrary, Mr. Santandreu asserts that while he did not, at the time, know he had an "ADA disability," both he and Miami Dade were aware that he suffered from anxiety, depression, and stress. (SMFO ¶ 11). This is because Plaintiff's doctors had submitted two letters in 2004 explaining to Miami Dade that he had anxiety, depression, stress, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea. (See Mot. Opp'n Exs. 1-2 [ECF Nos. 33-1, 33-2]).
As a remedy for the alleged harassment, Mr. Santandreu requested that Benavides's evaluations of him be rescinded, and that he be reassigned to another supervisor. (See SMF ¶ 13). Mr. Santandreu had made similar transfer requests before, beginning in [*7]  March 2005. (See id.). Miami Dade states all transfer requests were denied before anyone, including Mr. Santandreu, was "aware" of Plaintiff's disability. (Id.).
Mr. Santandreu again sought to extend his leave in January 2007. (See id. ¶ 14). This was approved, and his leave was continued to May 4, 2007. (See id.). Three days before the extension expired, on May 1, 2007, the Department sent Mr. Santandreu a letter via certified mail advising him that he was required to return to work on May 5, 2007. (See id. ¶ 15). After Mr. Santandreu failed to retrieve the letter from the post office, the Department hand-delivered a memorandum advising Plaintiff of this requirement. (See id.). Plaintiff did not return to work, and advised the Department via email on May 15, 2007, "that he would not be returning to work because his physician still considered him unfit for duty." (Id.).
In his email to the Department, Mr. Santandreu stated he expected to remain on leave until at least July 25, 2007. (See id.). But by May 2007, Plaintiff had exhausted all of his leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and under Miami Dade's policy. (See id. ¶ 16). The Department then contacted Mr. Santandreu [*8]  and told him he had three choices: (1) return to work; (2) resign; or (3) be terminated "for inability to perform his duties." (Id.). These choices were provided to Plaintiff and his union representative on June 1st and June 4th, 2007. (See id.).
Following this notice, the Department began processing the paperwork needed to terminate Mr. Santandreu. (See id. ¶ 17). The Department concluded that because Plaintiff had exhausted all of his leave and still could not return to work, he needed to be "dismissed for inability to perform his job." (Id.).
Before Mr. Santandreu was actually fired, he emailed the Department's Personnel Office stating, "'due to my actual health conditions, which do not allow me to reinstate to work [sic]; I hereby request my resignation from my position as an Engineer 1 from the Miami Dade-Dade Water and Sewer Department.'" (Id. ¶ 18) (quoting Mot. Ex. 27 [ECF No. 16-3]). Mr. Santandreu resigned in order to prevent a termination letter from becoming a permanent part of his file and because he was unable to return to work. (See id.; SMFO ¶ 18). Had he been fired and not resigned, Mr. Santandreu had the right to appeal that determination through Miami Dade's civil [*9]  service appeal process, or to "file a grievance under his union's collective bargaining agreement and to pursue binding arbitration." (SMF ¶ 17).
Four days after resigning, Mr. Santandreu attempted to retract his resignation. (See id. ¶ 19). On June 25, 2007, at 7:39 p.m., Plaintiff emailed the Department and stated "'I am not going to resign. I will be there to see you tomorrow.'" (Mot. Ex. 28 [ECF No. 16-3]). The Department replied to this attempted rescindment by email, stating the resignation "would stand," and the attempted rescindment was "untimely and [would] not be accepted." (Id.; SMF ¶ 19). Moreover, Defendant states Plaintiff was "not actually ready to return to work on June 26" because his doctor had not yet cleared him to work. (SMF ¶ 20).
The next day, on June 26, 2007, Plaintiff attempted to submit a "Reasonable Accommodation Request Form" to the Department's Personnel Office. (Id. ¶ 21). Because Mr. Santandreu had already resigned, the form was not accepted. (See id.).
Thereafter, on August 12, 2007, Mr. Santandreu filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") and Florida Commission on Human Rights ("FCHR"). (See SMF ¶ 22; Mot. Ex. 31 [ECF No. [*10]  16-3]). In the form, Plaintiff claimed he was discriminated against based on a "disability." (Id.). There were no retaliation allegations. (See id.). He then filed the instant action in Florida state court in October of 2010. (See Notice of Removal [ECF No. 1]). Mr. Santandreu amended his Complaint on November 2, 2010. (See Notice of Removal, Ex. B [ECF No. 1-3]). Miami Dade then removed the case to federal court on December 27, 2010. (See Notice of Removal).

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment shall be rendered "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In making this assessment, the Court "must view all the evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party," Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997), and "must resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant." United of Omaha Life Ins. Co. v. Sun Life Ins. Co. of Am., 894 F.2d 1555, 1558 (11th Cir. 1990).
"By its very terms, this standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported [*11]  motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (emphasis in original). "As to materiality, the substantive law will identify which facts are material. Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. at 248. Likewise, a dispute about a material fact is a "genuine" issue "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id.
"For factual issues to be considered genuine, they must have a real basis in the record . . . mere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion." Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted). The moving party "always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Summary judgment is proper "against [*12]  a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Id. at 322. In those cases, there is no genuine issue of material fact "since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial." Id. at 323.

III. ANALYSIS

A. Disability Discrimination
Mr. Santandreu's claims center around his assertion that he is disabled under the ADA and the Florida Civil Rights Act.2 (See Am. Compl.). His alleged disability stems from multiple impairments, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, and sleep apnea. (See id. ¶¶ 11, 13). Miami Dade asserts that while Mr. Santandreu may have been impaired, his impairments do not substantially limit any major life activities. (See Mot. 4). Therefore, Miami Dade contends he is not "disabled" within the meaning of the ADA. (Id.).
"'The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating 'against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee [*13]  compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.'" Dantuono v. Davis Vision, Inc., No. 07-CV-2234 (TCP)(ETB), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122119, 2009 WL 5196151, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 29, 2009) (quoting Leahy v. Gap, Inc., No. 07-CV-2008, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58812, 2008 WL 2946007, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. July 29, 2008)). "Employers of disabled persons are 'required to make reasonable accommodations for otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities and are prohibited from retaliating against an employee engaged in activities protected under the statute.'" Id. (quoting Leahy, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58812, 2008 WL 2946007, at *4).
To demonstrate a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, Mr. Santandreu must establish: "'(1) he has a disability; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability." Fikes v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 322 F. App'x 882, 883-84 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000)). A "disability" is defined as "(1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) a record of such an impairment; or3 (3) being regarded as so impaired."4 Id. at 884 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12102). Mr. Santandreu's claimed disability is based on his "mental and psychological disorders, specifically a generalized anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and other medical conditions," which allegedly "substantially impaired [his] daily and major life activities." (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 9-10).

1 . There are Material Issues [*14]  of Fact Concerning Whether Mr. Santandreu Has a "Disability."
a. "Substantially Limits"
Mental impairments may constitute a disability under the ADA if they substantially limit a major life activity. See Satchel v. Sch. Bd. of Hillsborough Cnty., 251 F. App'x 626, 629 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998)). For the impairment to be considered a disability, Plaintiff must demonstrate more than just the impairment; the impairment must also substantially limit a major life activity. See Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328 (citing Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assocs., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910 (11th Cir. 1996)). Moreover, it is not sufficient under the ADA if Mr. Santandreu suffered "some limitation" of a major life activity; it is essential the limitation be "substantial." Fikes, 322 F. App'x at 884.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") defines a mental impairment as "[a]ny mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h)(2). When determining whether Mr. Santandreu's impairments substantially limited a major life activity (thus making him disabled), the Court must consider: "'(1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (3) the permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.'" [*15]  Satchel, 251 F. App'x at 629 (quoting Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328). The EEOC regulations define major life activities as "functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i).
Work is a major life activity. See id. The EEOC regulations further define when an impairment "substantially limits" the major life activity of working. Id. § 1630.2(j). "Under the ADA, a physical impairment does not substantially limit the major life activity of working merely because it precludes the performance of one particular job." Standard, 161 F.3d at 1327 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i)); see also Hollins v. Fulton Cnty., 422 Fed. Appx. 828, 2011 WL 1331978, at *3 (11th Cir. 2011). Rather, "the impairment must significantly restrict 'the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.'" Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i)).
Plaintiff's ability to work was not substantially impaired. Mr. Santandreu admits he was fully capable of performing his job at all times when he was employed by Miami Dade, so long as it was under a different supervisor, and even if not granted the accommodation he sought. (See Am. Compl. ¶ 10 ("[D]espite [Mr. [*16]  Santandreu's] conditions he was able to perform the essential functions of his job even without the requested reasonable accommodation."). Therefore, he cannot be considered disabled by virtue of ADA section 12102(2)(A) as a result of a substantial limit on his ability to work. See Standard, 161 F.3d at 1327. Mr. Santandreu's inability to perform a "single, particular job" while working under Benavides does not "constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." Jones v. STOA Int'l/Fla., Inc., 422 Fed. Appx. 851, 2011 WL 1332182, at *2 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing Rossbach v. City of Miami, 371 F.3d 1354, 1357-58 & n.4 (11th Cir. 2004)); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i). As Miami Dade points out, it appears the only thing Mr. Santandreu was unable to do was work under Benavides. (See Mot. 4).
Although not substantially limited in the major life activity of work, issues of fact exist concerning whether Mr. Santandreu was substantially limited in at least one other major life activity, making him disabled under the ADA. Mr. Santandreu's "sleeping was significantly affected by the sleep apnea." (Mot. Opp'n 11) (citing Santandreu Dep. 107:4-12, Feb. 9, 2011 [ECF No. 17]); (Santandreu Dep. 108:15-109:21). A doctor in 2004 wrote a letter stating Plaintiff suffered from "insomnia."5 (Dr. Lourdes Pola Letter, Mot. [*17]  Opp'n Ex. 16 [ECF No. 33-1]). Further, he was suffering from sleep apnea since at least 2004. (See Dr. Antonio M. Gordon Letter, Mot. Opp'n Ex. 2 [ECF No. 33-2]). Because sleeping is a major life activity, see Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *5 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007), there are material issues of fact concerning whether Mr. Santandreu's major life activities were substantially impaired.7 See Robinson v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., No. 3:05-CV-21 (CDL), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15803, 2007 WL 710155, at *4-5 (M.D. Ga. Mar. 6, 2007) (finding that although plaintiff's major life activity of working was not substantially limited, he was disabled under the ADA because his major life activity of sleeping was substantially impaired by his sleep apnea). As a result, Plaintiff's conditions may qualify as ADA disabilities. That question will be determined by a jury.
b. "Record of" Impairment
Additionally, Plaintiff submits sufficient evidence indicating he has a "record of" impairments. A plaintiff has a "record of" an impairment where he or she "has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(k)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(j)(2)(iii).
"The intent of this provision, in part, is to ensure that people are not discriminated against because of a history of disability. [*18]  . . .
This part of the definition is satisfied if a record relied on by an employer indicates that the individual has or has had a substantially limiting impairment. . . . There are many types of records that could potentially contain this information, including but not limited to, education, medical, or employment records."
Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App. § 1630.2(k) (1997) (alterations in original)). This "record-of-impairment standard" is only satisfied if the plaintiff "actually suffered a physical impairment that substantially limited one or more of her major life activities." Id.
To determine whether Mr. Santandreu has a "record of" impairment, the Court must undertake a three-part inquiry: (1) whether he "has a history of a mental or physical impairment;" (2) "whether the impairment limited an activity qualifying as a major life activity under the Act;" and if the answers to (1) and (2) are yes, (3) "whether the alleged limitation was substantial." Adams v. Rice, 531 F.3d 936, 946, 382 U.S. App. D.C. 207 (D.C. Cir. 2008).
Here, Plaintiff has a record of depression, anxiety, hypertension, insomnia, and sleep apnea that dates to at least 2004. (See Mot. Opp'n Exs. 1-2). There is a paper trail and testimony leading back to 2004 demonstrating that Plaintiff suffered from certain [*19]  impairments. (See id.; Cuervo Dep. 82:2-6, May 6, 2011 [ECF No. 33-18]). Even Defendant concedes that depression and anxiety are impairments, and may be disabilities where they substantially impair a major life activity. (See Mot. 4). Mr. Santandreu thus has a "record of" an impairment.
Considering the second and third points, the Court has already determined that there are at least material issues of fact concerning whether or not Plaintiff's impairments substantially impaired his ability to sleep.
Therefore, Plaintiff has demonstrated there are material issues of fact as to whether he has record of a disability, rendering summary judgment inappropriate.
c. "Regarded As" Disability
Plaintiff also maintains Miami Dade "perceived" him as having a disability. (Am. Compl. ¶ 33). In support, he points to the Disciplinary Action Report ("DAR") dated June 14, 2007 [ECF No. 33-11], where Miami Dade acknowledged that his "physical ailment or defect" was "permanent or chronic." (June 14, 2007 DAR, Mot. Opp'n Ex. 11). Therefore, Mr. Santandreu concludes, Miami Dade "deemed Plaintiff's condition as permanent" and "deemed him disabled and simply wanted him out." (Mot. Opp'n 15).
An individual is "regarded [*20]  as" disabled where he or she
"(1) [h]as a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation; (2) [h]as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or (3) [h]as none of the impairments defined in paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment."
Jones, 422 Fed. Appx. 851, 2011 WL 1332182, at *2 (quoting D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, 422 F.3d 1220, 1228 (11th Cir. 2005)). Under this rubric, an employer violates the ADA where it makes "'an employment decision based on a physical or mental impairment, real or imagined, that is regarded as substantially limiting a major life activity.'" Id. (quoting D'Angelo, 422 F.3d at 1228).
To state a proper claim for "regarded as" disability, Mr. Santandreu must establish two elements: "(1) that the perceived disability involves a major life activity, and (2) that the perceived disability is 'substantially limiting' and significant." Id. (citing Sutton v. Lader, 185 F.3d 1203, 1208 (11th Cir. 1999)).
As discussed, there are material issues of fact as to whether Mr. Santandreu's major life activity of sleeping was substantially limited as a result of his impairments. Miami Dade was aware of [*21]  and considered his ailments "permanent or chronic." (Mot. Opp'n Ex. 11, 2). Thus, even if Plaintiff was not actually substantially limited, there is evidence that Miami Dade regarded him as such. As a result, there are material issues of fact. Summary judgment is denied and this claim may therefore proceed on this ground.

2. There are Issues of Fact Concerning Miami Dade's Knowledge of Mr. Santandreu's Alleged Disability.
Miami Dade asserts it could not have discriminated against Mr. Santandreu "because of" his disability given that it was not aware he was disabled. (Mot. 5). It contends it could not have "known" Mr. Santandreu was disabled when he himself did not know until sometime after April 2006, a point when Plaintiff had already filed discrimination claims. (Id. 6).
In order to discriminate against employees because of their disabilities, the employer must be aware of those disabilities. "An employer cannot be liable under the ADA . . . when it indisputably had no knowledge of the disability . . . ." Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1175 (11th Cir. 2005).8 It is insufficient to say the employer "should have known" of the disability. Id. "[T]he ADA does not presuppose that the employer is always aware that the employee belongs to the protected [*22]  category known as 'the disabled.'" Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., No. 6:01CV1132ORL19KRS, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26624, 2003 WL 21295143, at *8 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 24, 2003). The Eleventh Circuit, quoting and relying on the Seventh Circuit, acknowledged that
[A]n employer cannot be liable under the ADA for firing an employee when it indisputably had no knowledge of the disability. . . . At the most basic level, it is intuitively clear when viewing the ADA's language in a straightforward manner that an employer cannot fire an employee "because of" a disability unless it knows of the disability. If it does not know of the disability, the employer is firing the employee "because of" some other reason
Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 448 (11th Cir. 1996) (emphasis in original) (quoting Hedberg v. Ind. Bell Tel. Co., 47 F.3d 928, 932 (7th Cir. 1995)). "Appellate courts, therefore, have held that recovery under the ADA is foreclosed where plaintiffs cannot show by a preponderance of the evidence that their employers even knew of their disabilities because such knowledge is a logical precondition for the possibility of discrimination." Cordoba, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26624, 2003 WL 21295143, at *8. Like in Cordoba, "[u]nless Plaintiff can adduce probative evidence of Defendant's actual knowledge of [his] disability, [his] case amounts to little more than an example of the logical fallacy post hoc, ergo propter hoc ('after this, therefore because of this.')." [*23]  2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26624, [WL] at *9.
There are material issues of fact concerning Miami Dade's knowledge of Plaintiff's disability (if he has one). It is true Mr. Santandreu conceded during his deposition that his employer was unaware of his disability. (Santandreu Dep. 27:3-23; 51:9-52:1; 120:8-18). There, Mr. Santandreu states he did not know he was disabled until sometime after April 7, 2006. (See id. 87:20-89:12). Further, on his Department Complaint, Mr. Santrandeu did not check-off the box indicating disability discrimination, because he was unaware he was disabled. (See id. 84:18-89:12).
Mr. Santandreu, however, contends that at the time he did not understand the legal definition of "disability" and did not understand "there was a difference between conditions, limitations, and disabilities under the ADA." (Santandreu Decl. ¶ 3, Mot. Opp'n Ex. 15 [ECF No. 33-15]). Furthermore, Mr. Santandreu submits copies of doctors' letters furnished to Miami Dade in 2004, stating which ailments he suffered from. (See Mot. Opp'n Exs. 1, 2). In addition, Mr. Santandreu states he told his supervisors of his depression and anxiety, and personally gave the doctors' letters to his personnel department. (See Santandreu Dep. [*24]  24:13-16, 25:16-25). There is thus evidence that Miami Dade had knowledge of Mr. Santandreu's alleged disabilities as early as 2004 — prior to the alleged discrimination.

3. There are Issues of Fact Concerning Miami Dade's Duty to Accommodate Mr. Santandreu.
Miami Dade insists Mr. Santandreu's ADA claim should be dismissed because the accommodation he sought — a transfer — was "unreasonable as a matter of law." (Mot. 6). It maintains Mr. Santandreu "began demanding" a transfer in 2005 after "a series of negative evaluations . . . ."9 (Id.). It also contends that a transfer was the "only form of accommodation he ever requested." (Id.).
"Under the ADA rubric of discrimination, an employer must make reasonable accommodations that allow a disabled individual to perform her job, unless that accommodation would cause an undue hardship." Standard, 161 F.3d at 1327 (citing Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 519 (11th Cir. 1996); 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). Examples of "[r]easonable accommodations may include job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, and reassignment to another position." Boone v. Rumsfeld, 172 F. App'x 268, 272 (11th Cir. 2006) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o); and Talavera v. Sch. Bd. of Palm Beach Cnty., 129 F.3d 1214, 1217 (11th Cir. 1997)).
"A leave of absence and leave extensions are reasonable accommodations in some circumstances." Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 443 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing Rodgers v. Lehman, 869 F.2d 253, 259 (4th Cir. 1989)). "Whether the leave [*25]  request is reasonable turns on the facts of the case." Id. To be reasonable, the leave request must be temporary and for a set duration; it cannot be indefinite or open-ended. See Fogleman v. Greater Hazleton Health Alliance, 122 F. App'x 581, 586 (3d Cir. 2004). In May 2007, Mr. Santandreu advised that he could not return to work until July 26, 2007 — 11 weeks away — when his doctor's certificate expired. (See Santandreu Dep. 54:21-55:23). Mr. Santandreu asserts he was prepared to return to work as soon as his "certificate" expired on July 26. (Santandreu Dep. 55:8-23). His final leave "request"10 was thus for a definite and set duration, and was temporary in nature.
Generally, an employee does not need to use any magic words or precise phrasing in order to trigger the employer's obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation. See Workplace Accommodations Under The ADA, in ADA Workplace Chapter 4 (2004) ("The request for accommodation does not have to be in writing and no magic language is required, not even the words reasonable accommodation."). For example, the Seventh Circuit found this duty to provide a reasonable accommodation was triggered by an employee simply saying to the employer "'I want to keep working for you — do you have any suggestions?'" Miller v. Ill. Dep't of Corr., 107 F.3d 483, 486-87 (7th Cir. 1997) (citing [*26]  42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B)). That type of conversation invokes the employer's "duty under the Act to ascertain whether he has some job that the employee might be able to fill." Id. at 487 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B)).
In order to determine what is a reasonable accommodation, the EEOC sets forth a "flexible, interactive process involving both the employer and employee or job applicant." Workplace Accommodations Under The ADA, ADA Workplace Chapter 4 (2004). The approach advocated for by the EEOC is as follows:
When a qualified individual with a disability has requested a reasonable accommodation to assist in the performance of a job, the employer, using a problem solving approach, should:
(1) Analyze the particular job involved and determine its purpose and essential functions;
(2) Consult with the individual with a disability to ascertain the precise job-related limitations imposed by the individual's disability and how those limitations could be overcome with a reasonable accommodation;
(3) In consultation with the individual to be accommodated, identify potential accommodations and assess the effectiveness each would have in enabling the individual to perform the essential functions of the position; and
(4) Consider the preference of the individual [*27]  to be accommodated and select and implement the accommodation that is most appropriate for both the employee and the employer.
29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.9. In certain cases, where the appropriate accommodation is not readily apparent, "it may be necessary for the employer to initiate a more defined problem solving process, such as the step-by-step process described above, as part of its reasonable effort to identify the appropriate reasonable accommodation." Id. This problem-solving process "requires the individual assessment of both the particular job at issue, and the specific physical or mental limitations of the particular individual in need of reasonable accommodation." Id. Where consultation between the employer and employee "still does not reveal potential appropriate accommodations," "technical assistance" may be helpful. Id. "[T]he failure to obtain or receive technical assistance from the Federal agencies that administer the ADA will not excuse the employer from its reasonable accommodation obligation." Id. This process may disclose multiple available accommodations. See id. It is then the employer's decision, with the individual's preference considered, as to which accommodation is most appropriate. [*28] 
As discussed, Mr. Santandreu sought an "accommodation in the form of transfers and assistance from employer in abating the hostile environment." (Am. Compl. ¶ 14; see also Santandreu Dep. 36:24-48:6, 93:11-17; Mot. Ex. 32, Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Interrog. No. 12 [ECF No. 16-3]). He also sought to extend his leave. (See SMF ¶ 15). While that specific request for a transfer may not have been for a reasonable accommodation, the request for more time off may have been.11 Given the lax requirements for what triggers an employer's duty to accommodate, the question is whether that request, as well as other requests, imposed a duty on Miami Dade to determine whether there were any available reasonable accommodations for Mr. Santandreu (including additional leave).
A transfer from an incompatible supervisor is not a "reasonable accommodation." Gaul v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 134 F.3d 576, 581 (3d Cir. 1998). The court in Gaul rejected the plaintiff's proposed accommodation "to be transferred away from coworkers who subjected him to prolonged and inordinate stress" as unreasonable as a matter of law." Id. at 581; see also Bradford v. City of Chi., 121 F. App'x 137, 140 (7th Cir. 2005); Felix v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 324 F.3d 102, 108 (2d Cir. 2003) (Jacobs, J. concurring) ("[I]f a nasty supervisor induces a stress level that substantially impairs an employee's sleep (a major life activity), [*29]  I do not think that the employer is required to accommodate the sleep impairment by a transfer to a boss who is nicer."); Wernick v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., 91 F.3d 379, 383-84 (2d Cir. 1996); Prichard v. Dominguez, No. 3:05cv40/RV/MD, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46607, 2006 WL 1836017, at *9, 14 (N.D. Fla. June 29, 2006) (collecting cases).
Mr. Santandreu contends, however, there were reasonable accommodations available. (See Mot. Opp'n 16). He further maintains that just because he did not know the proper way to seek an accommodation, or even know the definition of one, this should not "absolve the County of failing to provide said accommodation." (Id. 16 & n.17).
While transfer away from a specific supervisor may not be a reasonable accommodation, "[a] reasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to, such ameliorations as: (1) additional unpaid leave; (2) job restructuring; (3) part-time or modified work schedules; or even (4) reassignment to a vacant position." Dockery v. N. Shore Med. Ctr., 909 F. Supp. 1550, 1555-56 (S.D. Fla. 1995) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B)).
Because there are no magic words or precise phrasings required to trigger the duty to accommodate, and Plaintiff asserts that providing 11 more weeks of unpaid leave would have satisfactorily accommodated him, summary judgment is not appropriate on the basis that there were no available reasonable accommodations. Furthermore, Mr. Santandreu implies in his deposition [*30]  that he spoke with a "person," as well as a "tall" "dark" "fellow," both of whom worked for Miami Dade, about "wanting" an accommodation. (Santandreu Dep. 43:21-44:11, 47:15-48:6). Considering the relaxed requirements for what is considered an accommodation request, because Mr. Santandreu sought to extend his leave (which may be considered a reasonable accommodation), and because Mr. Santandreu further discussed his desire for an accommodation with the "person" as well as the "tall dark fellow," there is a question of fact as to whether Mr. Santandreu sought a reasonable accommodation. See Rascon v. U.S. W. Commc'ns, Inc., 143 F.3d 1324, 1335 (10th Cir. 1998) (finding a four-month leave accommodation request reasonable). Mr. Santandreu's request was for a limited duration of 11 weeks — it was finite and not open-ended.12 Cf. Fogleman, 122 F. App'x at 586. He planned on returning to work when his certificate expired on July 26, 2007. (See Santandreu Dep. 55:8-23). The Court thus leaves the determination on this question for a jury.

4. There are Issues of Fact Concerning Whether Mr. Santandreu Was "Qualified."
In order to successfully allege an ADA discrimination claim, plaintiffs must prove they are "qualified." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). Mr. Santandreu asserts he was "qualified" for his position. [*31]  (See Compl. ¶ 10; Santandreu Dep. 35:17-23). "The term qualified individual means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Although Defendant contends that Mr. Santandreu "seems to argue" that due to the workplace conditions "he was unable to work at all" (Reply 8), at a minimum, there are material issues of fact concerning whether he was a qualified individual. (See Santandreu Dep. 35:17-23) (stating he was capable of working within his classification despite his ailments).

B. The Hostile Work Environment "Claim" is Untimely.
Plaintiff asserts he was subjected to a hostile and intimidating work environment. (See Am. Compl. ¶ 35). Miami Dade contends these claims are untimely as Plaintiff did not file his EEOC Charge of Discrimination until August 12, 2007. (See Mot. 10; EEOC Charge, Mot. Ex. 31 [ECF No. 16-3]).13 Because Plaintiff began his leave of absence on January 27, 2006 (see Mot. Ex. 11 [ECF No. 16-3]), Miami Dade asserts he could not have been harassed or subjected to a hostile work environment within either 300 or 365 days prior to the date he filed his [*32]  EEOC charge. (See Mot. 10). Plaintiff does not respond to this argument. (See Mot. Opp'n 20-21).
Before filing a court complaint, a plaintiff must first file an EEOC charge. Myers v. Cent. Fla. Invs., Inc., 592 F.3d 1201, 1210 n.2 (11th Cir. 2010). To be timely under the ADA, the plaintiff must file the EEOC charge within 300 days of any violation. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e); Myers, 592 F.3d at 1210 n.2 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)). To be timely under the FCRA, a plaintiff must file an EEOC charge (or complaint with Florida)14 within 365 days of a violation. See Fla. Stat. § 760.11(1); Myers, 592 F.3d at 1210 n.2 (citing Fla. Stat. § 760.11(1)). "'Each discrete discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act.'" Riccard v. Prudential Ins. Co., 307 F.3d 1277, 1291 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 102, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002)). Acts that occurred prior to the 300 or 365 day period are barred as untimely. See Myers, 592 F.3d at 1210 & n.2.
Here, Mr. Santandreu began his leave on January 27, 2006.15 (See Mot. Ex. 11). He therefore was not at work, could not be harassed at work, and could not be subjected to a hostile work environment from that day forward. Plaintiff's earliest discrimination charge was not filed until August 7, 2007. Three hundred days from January 27, 2006 was November 23, 2006, and 365 days from January 27, 2006 was January 27, 2007. To be timely for a claim of at least some harassment, the EEOC charge needed to be filed by those dates. Looking at this [*33]  from the opposite direction, the August 7, 2007 charge was only timely, and Miami Dade could therefore only be liable, for harassment under the ADA that occurred on or after October 11, 2006, and harassment under the FCRA that occurred on or after August 7, 2006. By both August 7, 2006 and October 11, 2006, however, Plaintiff was already on leave and could not possibly have been subjected to harassment at work or a hostile work environment. See Fig. 1 (providing a graphical representation of the above-described timeline). Any harassment or hostile work environments occurred over 365 days before the administrative charge was filed, making the claims untimely and barred by the statute of limitations. See Myers, 592 F.3d at 1210. Summary judgment, therefore, is appropriate on these claims.16 See Fikes, 322 F. App'x at 884 ("Because Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on his hostile work environment claim, summary judgment was due to be granted on this claim.").

C. The Retaliation Claim May Proceed.
The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a charge, testified, [*34]  assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [the ADA]." 42 U.S.C. § 12203. Because the ADA's prohibition on retaliation is similar to Title VII's prohibition on retaliation, courts "assess ADA retaliation claims under the same framework employed for retaliation claims arising under Title VII." Satchel, 251 F. App'x at 629.
To establish a prima facie case of ADA retaliation, Mr. Santandreu must show: "'(1) that he engaged in statutorily protected activity;17 (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action.'" Id. (alterations omitted) (quoting Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328). If Mr. Santandreu establishes a prima facie case, then Miami Dade has the "'opportunity to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action.'" Id. (quoting Pennington v. City of Huntsville, 261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir. 2001)).
"An adverse employment action is an ultimate employment decision, such as discharge or other conduct that 'alters the employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an employee.'" Cavicchi v. Chertoff ex rel. U.S. Bureau of Customs & Border Prot., No. 06-21406-CIV, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6192, 2008 WL 239157, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 28, 2008) [*35]  (quoting Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 212 F.3d 571, 587 (11th Cir. 2000)). When a performance evaluation is "inextricably intertwined" with compensation or benefits, it may constitute an adverse employment action. Rainey v. Holder, 412 Fed. Appx. 235, 2011 WL 311707, at *2 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 971-72 (11th Cir. 2008)). "However, when a lower performance evaluation does not result in a 'loss of pay or benefits or further discipline,' it does not constitute an adverse employment action" Id. (quoting Davis v. Town of Lake Park, 245 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir. 2001)). Plaintiff asserts his termination by Miami Dade (no matter how it officially occurred) and Miami Dade's issuance of the DAR constituted adverse employment actions.

1. Mr. Santandreu's Resignation
Miami Dade asserts Mr. Santandreu is not entitled to damages resulting from the loss of employment because he voluntarily resigned, and resignations are not adverse employment actions. (See Mot. 13). Further, Miami Dade maintains Plaintiff was not constructively discharged. (See id. 15-16). And finally, Miami Dade insists that because Mr. Santandreu had the right to appeal in the event he was fired, his resignation could not, as a matter of law, have been involuntary. (See id. 16-17). Plaintiff responds that Miami Dade describes the choices incorrectly. (See Mot. Opp'n 19). According to Mr. Santandreu, the choice was not between resigning and possible termination, but between "'resigning and returning to work against his doctor's certificate,' and 'resigning and having his record tarnished with a DAR." (Id.) (emphasis omitted) (quoting nothing).
a. Plaintiff Voluntarily Resigned.
"[E]mployee resignations are presumed to be voluntary." Hargray v. City of Hallandale, 57 F.3d 1560, 1568 (11th Cir. 1995) (citations omitted). "'This presumption will prevail [*36]  unless [the employee] comes forward with sufficient evidence to establish that the resignation was involuntarily extracted.'" Id. (quoting Christie v. United States, 518 F.2d 584, 587, 207 Ct. Cl. 333 (Ct. Claims 1975)). A resignation is involuntary in two situations: "(1) where the employer forces the resignation by coercion or duress; or (2) where the employer obtains the resignation by deceiving or misrepresenting a material fact to the employee." Id. (citations omitted).
In determining whether a resignation was coerced or the result of duress, the Court must consider "whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the employer's conduct in obtaining the employee's resignation deprived the employee of free will in choosing to resign." Id. In making this decision, certain non-dispositive factors may guide the Court:
(1) whether the employee was given some alternative to resignation; (2) whether the employee understood the nature of the choice he was given; (3) whether the employee was given a reasonable time in which to choose; (4) whether the employee was permitted to select the effective date of the resignation; and (5) whether the employee had the advice of counsel.
Id. (citations omitted). Whether "'real alternatives were offered is gauged by an objective [*37]  standard rather than by the employee's purely subjective evaluation; that the employee may perceive his only option to be resignation . . . is irrelevant.'" Id. (quoting Stone v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys., Corp., 855 F.2d 167, 173 (4th Cir. 1988)).
"'[T]he mere fact that the choice is between comparably unpleasant alternatives . . . does not of itself establish that a resignation was induced by duress or coercion, hence was involuntary." Id. (quoting Stone, 855 F.2d at 174). A resignation may still be voluntary where the only other choice is "facing possible termination for cause or criminal charges." Id. (citing Pitt v. United States, 420 F.2d 1028, 1033-34, 190 Ct. Cl. 506 (Ct. Claims 1970)); see also Paasch v. City of Safety Harbor, 915 F. Supp. 315, 322 (M.D. Fla. 1995) ("The plaintiff, therefore, cannot rebut the presumption that his resignation was voluntary simply by showing that he resigned because he was facing termination."). "Resignations obtained in cases where an employee is faced with such unpleasant alternatives are nevertheless voluntary because 'the fact remains that plaintiff had a choice. [Plaintiff] could stand pat and fight.'" Hargray, 57 F.3d at 1568 (quoting Christie, 518 F.2d at 587).
In Hargray, the district court found the plaintiff's resignation was involuntary as he did not have a real alternative to resigning because
(1) Hargray was not given advance notice of the nature of the charges against him; (2) he did not have an opportunity to consider alternatives; [*38]  (3) he did not have an opportunity to consult an attorney; (4) he did not have a reasonable amount of time to make a carefully-considered decision; and (5) he did not have the opportunity to select the effective date of his resignation . . . [and (6)] Hargray felt intimidated during the interview.
Id. at 1568-69. The Eleventh Circuit reversed, finding plaintiff's argument was "reduced to" "that he was forced to make an unpleasant decision in a short period of time, while he felt intimidated, without the advice of an attorney." Id. at 1569. The court then determined that "[u]nfortunately for Hargray, the mere fact that he was forced to choose between two inherently unpleasant alternatives does not in itself mean that his resignation was submitted under duress." Id. It was insufficient to support duress "that Hargray was forced to make the decision to resign while under time pressure and that he did so without the advice of counsel." Id. at 1570.
Under the framework outlined in Hargray, there are no issues of material fact; the resignation was voluntary. Although Mr. Santandreu was aware he had the option to "stand pat and fight," Paasch, 915 F. Supp. at 322, and had the right to appeal any termination (see Santandreu Dep. 68:19-23, 70:4-7), Mr. Santandreu [*39]  chose to resign. Further, Mr. Santandreu fully admitted that he did not have to resign, but could have waited to see if he was fired. (See id. 73:16-74:1). He simply wanted to save himself the aggravation of being fired and then appealing. (See id. 73:25-74:1).
Finally, Plaintiff's alternative framing of his choices, between "'resigning and returning to work against his doctor's certificate,'" or "'resigning and having his record tarnished with a DAR'" (Mot. Opp'n 19), are not persuasive. These were not the actual choices facing Plaintiff. Regarding the first alternative, this is simply not true. Plaintiff could have remained on leave, kept asserting further leave should have been approved, and waited to see what happened. While this possibly could have led to termination, he would then have had the ability to challenge that termination via an appeal.
Regarding the second alternative, this too is inaccurate. Because Plaintiff had adequate legal remedies to challenge either the DAR or possible termination, the threatened actions do not constitute duress. See City of Miami Dade v. Kory, 394 So. 2d 494, 499 (Fla. 3d DCA 1981); see also Driggers v. City of Owensboro, Ky., 110 F. App'x 499, 506-07 (6th Cir. 2004) (finding no constructive discharge where the city employer threatened "some form of discipline that might include dismissal" [*40]  because it was "speculative" to conclude the inevitable result was termination since plaintiff had the right to challenge that decision). Furthermore, even if Plaintiff is correct that he had two difficult decisions, "the mere fact that he was forced to choose between two inherently unpleasant alternatives does not in itself mean that his resignation was submitted under duress." Hargray, 57 F.3d at 1569. The Court cannot say, on the presented facts, that there is an issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff was coerced into resigning.
b. Miami Dade Made No Misrepresentations.
In determining whether a resignation was obtained through misrepresentation, "a court may find a resignation to be involuntary if induced by an employee's reasonable reliance upon an employer's misrepresentation of a material fact concerning the resignation." Id. at 1570 (citing Scharf v. Dep't of the Air Force, 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983)). There is no evidence of any misrepresentations here.
c. Plaintiff Was Not Constructively Discharged.
Next, Miami Dade maintains that Mr. Santandreu has not alleged in the Complaint a constructive discharge, and even if he had, he does not meet the high threshold to prevail on this theory. (See Mot. 15-16).
"Under the constructive discharge doctrine, an employee's reasonable decision [*41]  to resign because of unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes." Pa. State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 141, 124 S. Ct. 2342, 159 L. Ed. 2d 204 (2004) (citing 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 838-39 (3d ed. 1996)). "An employer 'is responsible for a constructive discharge in the same manner that it is responsible for the outright discriminatory discharge of a charging party.'" Id. at 142 (quoting 2 EEOC Compliance Manual § 612.9(a) (2002)). In making this determination, the Court must determine whether, objectively, "working conditions [became] so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign." Id. at 141 (citing C. Weirich et al., 2002 Cumulative Supplement to Lindemann & Grossman 651-52, & n.1). In order for Plaintiff to prove this, he must come forward with "substantial evidence" of the "intolerable conditions." Figueira v. Sch. Bd. of Miami Dade-Dade Cnty., Fla., No. 06-21828-CIV, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84713, 2007 WL 3286758, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 11, 2007) (citing Akins v. Fulton Cnty., 420 F.3d 1293, 1302 (11th Cir. 2005)).
"The threshold for establishing constructive discharge . . . is quite high." Hipp v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 252 F.3d 1208, 1231 (11th Cir. 2001). The standard is higher than proving a hostile work environment existed. See id. To demonstrate a constructive discharge occurred, there must have been "pervasive conduct." Id. Further, "[p]art of an employee's obligation to be [*42]  reasonable is an obligation not to assume the worst, and not to jump to conclusions too fast." Garner v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 807 F.2d 1536, 1539 (11th Cir. 1987). "'[D]issatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized, or difficult or unpleasant working conditions are not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign.'" Williams v. Russell Corp., 218 F. Supp. 2d 1283, 1299 (M.D. Ala. 2002) (quoting Matvia v. Bald Head Is. Mgmt., Inc., 259 F.3d 261, 273 (4th Cir. 2001)); see also Jones v. Fitzgerald, 285 F.3d 705, 716 (8th Cir. 2002) ("Constructive discharge requires considerably more proof than an unpleasant and unprofessional environment.").
On the evidence provided, the Court finds that no reasonable juror could conclude that Mr. Santandreu's conditions were so intolerable that he was compelled to resign. At worst, he was unfairly criticized and suffered through some unpleasant working conditions. This is insufficient to support a constructive-discharge claim. See Matvia, 259 F.3d at 273. Reprimands and threats of firing do "not automatically translate into constructive discharge." Summit v. S-B Power Tool, 121 F.3d 416, 421 (8th Cir. 1997); see also Hill v. St. Louis Univ., 923 F. Supp. 1199, 1209 (E.D. Mo. 1996) ("[M]erely being informed of termination cannot constitute a 'constructive discharge.'"). Furthermore, Miami Dade's remedial scheme, whereby Mr. Santandreu could have challenged any termination, is a consideration that weighs against finding constructive discharge. See Pa. State Police, 542 U.S. at 151-52. Failing to avail himself of Miami Dade's administrative remedies [*43]  deals a crippling body blow to his constructive-discharge claim. See Matias v. Sears Home Improvement Prods., Inc., 391 F. App'x 782, 788 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Bryant v. Jones, 575 F.3d 1281, 1298 (11th Cir. 2009)). This conclusion that there was no constructive discharge is especially true in light of the fact that at the time of his resignation, Mr. Santandreu had not been at work for over 18 months, and was therefore not subject to any working conditions, less unbearably hostile ones. See Jones, 285 F.3d 716. Based on the record, there are no material questions of fact on this issue; Plaintiff voluntarily resigned, and there was no constructive discharge.

2 . There are Issues of Fact Concerning Whether the DAR was an Adverse Employment Action.
Although Plaintiff was not fired as an adverse employment action, the retaliation claim may survive. While out on leave, Miami Dade issued Plaintiff a DAR. (See Mot. Opp'n 18). Plaintiff asserts that when Miami Dade issued him the DAR it was retaliating for his "insistence" of "additional time off." (Id.). The DAR was issued on June 16, 2007, making this claim timely18 because the act occurred less than 300 days before August 7, 2007. (See Mot. Opp'n Ex. 11 [ECF No. 33-11]). Plaintiff asserts the DAR "adversely affected Plaintiff's [employment] status." (Mot. Opp'n 19) (citing Mot. Opp'n Ex. 11). [*44] 
The DAR, while not explicitly stating it would affect Plaintiff's status as an employee, strongly indicates that there would be adverse consequences to Plaintiff's "salary, benefits, title, or job duties." Summerlin v. M&H Valve Co., 167 F. App'x 93, 97 (11th Cir. 2006). By providing an option of resigning rather than having the DAR as part of his file, Miami Dade was indicating having the DAR in his file would have severe enough repercussions that resigning was a better option. Further, taking leave under the FMLA is protected activity. See Terry v. Real Talent, Inc., No. 8:09-cv-1756-T-30TBM, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98247, 2010 WL 3749224, at *8 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 20, 2010). Finally, a potential causal relationship is demonstrated by the DAR's reference to his medical leave. (See Mot. Opp'n Ex. 11). There are thus material issues of fact as to whether Miami Dade was retaliating against Plaintiff in issuing the DAR, and summary judgment is not appropriate on this claim. Moving forward, however, Plaintiff may not rely on any alleged retaliation that occurred before October 11, 2006 for ADA purposes, or before August 7, 2006 for FCRA purposes.

D. The Negligent Retention and Supervision Claim Fails.
Plaintiff's third claim is a state-law claim for "Negligent Retention/Supervision." (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 45-50). Defendant asserts this [*45]  claim should be dismissed because "Florida does not recognize such a cause of action." (Mot. 18). It maintains that "negligent retention or supervision . . . based on the hostile environment [a] supervisor . . . created" is simply not cognizable. (See id.). "Under Florida law, the underlying wrong allegedly committed by an employee in a negligent supervision or negligent retention claim must be based on an injury resulting from a tort which is recognized under common law." Scelta v. Delicatessen Support Servs., Inc., 57 F. Supp. 2d 1327, 1348 (M.D. Fla. 1999). Defendant characterizes the underlying tort as failing to maintain a work environment free of harassment. (See Mot. 18). Plaintiff disagrees with this characterization.
Plaintiff contends this claim arises from Defendant's "negligence in supervising and training an employee (Benavides) while they [sic] had been put on notice of employee's dangerous propensities." (Mot. Opp'n 21). In support, Plaintiff cites a case where the employee shot the plaintiff, Mallory v. O'Neil, 69 So. 2d 313, 314 (Fla. 1954). (See id.). Plaintiff's citation highlights an important theme in these sorts of cases — they often concern violence. See, e.g., DeJesus v. Jefferson Stores, Inc., 383 So. 2d 274, 274 (Fla. 3d DCA 1980) (dismissing claim because no history of violence); Williams v. Feather Sound, Inc., 386 So. 2d 1238, 1239-41 (Fla. 2d DCA1980) (after a physical assault, remanded to determine the required level of inquiry into [*46]  the perpetrator's background where he had a history of "prowling"); but see Friedman v. Mut. Broad. Sys., 380 So. 2d 1313, 1314 (Fla. 3d DCA 1980) (dismissing negligent hiring claim where no facts demonstrating perpetrator's propensity to defraud).
As mentioned, "[u]nder Florida law, the underlying wrong allegedly committed by an employee in a negligent supervision or negligent retention claim must be based on an injury resulting from a tort which is recognized under common law." Scelta, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 1348. The court in Scelta held that because "Florida law does not recognize a common law cause of action for sexual harassment," "Florida law does not recognize a common law cause of action based on the negligent failure to maintain a workplace that is free of sexual harassment." Id. (citations omitted). In Scelta, the plaintiff alleged that her superiors sexually harassed her and other employees, creating a "sexually hostile work environment." Id. at 1335-36. Nevertheless, this was insufficient to support the negligent-retention claim. See id. at 1348; see also Merrick v. Radisson Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 8:06-cv-01591-T-24TGW, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39021, 2007 WL 1576361, at *5 (M.D. Fla. May 30, 2007).
Mr. Santandreu's claim is also akin to the claim considered in Castleberry v. Edward M. Chadbourne, Inc., 810 So. 2d 1028 (Fla. 1st DCA 2002). There, the plaintiff's underlying claim was for sexual harassment under the Florida Civil Rights Act. See Castleberry, 810 So. 2d at 1029. The court [*47]  allowed the sexual-harassment claims to proceed, but affirmed the trial court's entry of summary judgment against the plaintiff for claims of "negligent retention, negligent supervision, and negligent training." Id. at 1030. Those claims were based on the employer's "actual or constructive knowledge of its employees' propensity to speak and act in a sexist, harassing, and retaliatory fashion, and that [the employer] retained those individuals in its employ, and that [the employer] failed to properly train and supervise its employees and supervisors." Id. There were no allegations of a physical injury. See id. The court determined "Florida does not recognize a common law cause of action for negligent failure to maintain a workplace free of sexual harassment." Id. (citing Scelta, 57 F. Supp. 2d 1327).
Mr. Santandreu's Florida claims, like the claims in Castleberry and Scelta, stem from the Florida Civil Rights Act. Therefore, the Court finds Castleberry and Scelta persuasive and finds this claim may not proceed. The underlying wrong here is disability discrimination — which is a creature of statute under Florida law. See Fla. Stat. § 760.01 et seq. Although Plaintiff attempts to save this claim by alluding to Benavides's "harmful propensities," he [*48]  fails to provide any insight — or evidence — of these propensities beyond possibly discriminating against Plaintiff due to his alleged disability. There are simply no allegations of any other common-law tort or common-law claims.19 Defendant is therefore entitled to summary judgment on this claim.
