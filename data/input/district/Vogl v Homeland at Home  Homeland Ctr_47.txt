REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. Introduction
Pending before the court is a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Homeland at Home and Homeland Center (collectively, "Homeland"). (Doc. 62). The plaintiff, Patricia Vogl, a former employee of Homeland, filed this suit against Homeland alleging that she was unlawfully terminated from her position as Assistant Director of Social Services in October of 2017. Her complaint asserts a retaliation claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, a failure to accommodate claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), and violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") and the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA").
Homeland has filed the instant motion for summary judgment, arguing that Vogl's claims fail as a matter of law. For her part, the plaintiff does not oppose summary judgment as to her ADEA and FMLA claims. However, after a review of the record, [*2]  we conclude that there are genuine disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment on the plaintiff's Title VII and ADA claims. Accordingly, for the following reasons, we recommend that the defendants' motion be granted as to the ADEA and FMLA claims but denied as to the Title VII and ADA claims.

II. Statement of Facts and of the Case
Patricia Vogl was hired by Homeland in October of 2012 as a social worker. (Doc. 62-3, ¶ 2). Homeland Hospice, a division of Homeland, provides end-of-life services to patients and their families. (Id., ¶ 1). In July of 2013, Vogl was promoted to Assistant Direct of Social Services, a title she held until her employment with Homeland ended in October of 2017. (Id., ¶ 3). In this position, Vogl oversaw social workers, chaplains, bereavement counselors, and a volunteer coordinator, and she also took a small caseload of six to eight patients. (Id., ¶¶ 5-6).
In October of 2016, Vogl was indirectly involved in an incident of alleged racial discrimination against an African American nurse, Ms. Hardy, who was employed by Homeland. Ms. Hardy was on her way to a new client's home when she received a call from the social worker on the case, Ms. Brandt, that [*3]  she should turn around and send another nurse to the patient's home. (Id., ¶ 62). The patient's caregiver, her granddaughter, told Ms. Brandt that her grandmother "[didn't] want any black people coming here." (Id., ¶ 60). Ms. Brandt, whom Vogl supervised, was told by Sue Minarick, Homeland's Executive Director, to tell Ms. Hardy to return and to call a Caucasian nurse to go to the patient's home. (Id., ¶ 62). Vogl was on vacation at this time, but when she returned the following week, Ms. Brandt explained that the situation made her very upset. (Id., ¶¶ 63-64).
Thus, after the issue was raised at a Social Work Department Meeting, Vogl brought the issue to Homeland's Ethics Committee, of which she was the chairman. (Id., ¶ 65). During this meeting, the Committee came up with several recommendations of how to handle such incidents in the future, one being an anti-discrimination policy notice for clients on their admission forms. (Id., ¶¶ 66-67). According to the plaintiff, the agency's CEO, Barry Ramper, rejected all of the recommendations proposed by the Committee. (Doc. 75, at 8). Instead, he authorized Ms. Vogl and Ms. Brandt to meet with the patient and speak with her about the situation. [*4]  (Doc. 75-6, at 20). Ms. Brandt stated that, rather than address the Committee's concerns about discrimination and its recommendations to combat racial bias, Mr. Ramper's apparent solution was to consider hiring a driver to drive the patient and her granddaughter through Harrisburg to expose them to diversity. (Id., at 21-22).
Vogl claims that even though she was the chair of the Ethics Committee, Mr. Ramper called another meeting of the Committee while she was away at a professional conference. (Doc. 62-4, at 23). There was also a third meeting called while Vogl was away, during which Ms. Brandt resigned her position as a social worker. (Id.; Doc. 75-6, at 18). Ms. Brandt stated that during the meetings she attended, Mr. Ramper's tone was angry, he would not let anyone else speak, and he got upset when people questioned what the agency was doing. (Doc. 75-6, at 22-23). For her part, Vogl stated that after this incident, she was called into meetings with short notice, and she would be berated for her role in the alleged discrimination incident. (Doc. 62-4, at 23). She stated that at each meeting, she was told that she had exercised poor professional judgment, that her Committee recommendations [*5]  put the agency at risk, and that she should not have handled the incident the way that she did. (Id.) She noted that at one point in December of 2016, she left one of these meetings, and she was told by Sue Minarick that she would be required to attend another meeting the following morning if she wanted to remain the Assistant Director of Social Services. (Id., at 25; Doc. 75-27, at 2).
Vogl further noted that after the incident, her judgment on new hires was called into question by Nicol Brown of Human Resources and Mr. Ramper, who wanted to review all of the resumes and requirements before she hired a new social worker, which had never been the case prior to the alleged discrimination incident. (Doc. 62-4, at 24). From Vogl's perspective, these meetings and the attitudes toward her professional judgment were because she had made recommendations to prevent further instances of racial discrimination like the one that had occurred with Ms. Hardy. (Doc. 75-22, at 13).
In June of 2017, Vogl's son tragically died in an accidental drowning incident. (Doc. 62-4, at 27). Vogl notified Ms. Minarick and Deb Klinger, and she took three days of bereavement leave, as well as a few personal days [*6]  until after her son's funeral. (Id.) Vogl expressed that she needed some time off, and she was advised to take FMLA leave, as well as apply for short term disability benefits. (Id., at 28). Initially, Vogl was going to take one month of leave, but her physician recommended that she be off from full-time work for the total twelve weeks of her FMLA leave. (Doc. 62-4, at 81; Doc. 75-12, at 2; Doc. 75-13, at 2). Her physician's notes indicated that she was experiencing lack of concentration, insomnia, crying spells, daytime fatigue, and anxiety, and thus, her physician opined that Vogl could not work in the hospice field in any capacity at that time. (Doc. 62-4, at 81-82). Thus, Vogl took the entire twelve weeks she was allowed under the FMLA, which expired on October 6, 2017. (Doc. 75-12, at 2).
Prior to the expiration of her FMLA leave, Vogl's physician filled out paperwork related to her claim for short term disability benefits. (Doc. 75-17, at 3). Dr. Rubertone stated that Vogl "continues to process grief from sudden, tragic loss of her son, is on medications and undergoing therapy for same." (Id.) Dr. Rubertone opined that the plaintiff could return to full-time work on January 1, [*7]  2018. (Id.) At this time, Vogl sent an email to Deb Klinger, Sue Minarik, and Barry Ramper, indicating that she was not ready to return to work when her FMLA leave expired. (Doc. 75-19, at 2). While Vogl contends that she believed she could have returned to work on a part-time or hybrid basis of working in the office and working from home, she requested a Medical Leave of Absence from October 6, 2017 until December 31, 2017. (Doc. 75-14, at 2). This request was ultimately denied. (Id.)
On this score, the defendant contends that Vogl's leave of absence was denied because the agency needed a person in the position who could work full-time in person. Rachael Young, who had taken over Vogl's duties while she was on FMLA leave, expressed that she did not want to continue in Vogl's position and instead wanted to return to her social work caseload. (Doc. 62-4, at 55). Deb Klinger explained that when Vogl took leave and Young took over her assistant director responsibilities, both of their caseloads were distributed among the other social workers, which caused a strain on the workload. (Id.) Ms. Klinger further stated that it would be hard for a supervisory employee such as Vogl to work from [*8]  home. (Id., at 55-56). Nicol Brown, Homeland's HR director, stated that the decision to deny Vogl's request for leave was made in part due to her physician's documentation, and further, that it was ultimately Mr. Ramper's decision based on the needs of the operation of Vogl's department. (Id., at 61-62). Ms. Brown further stated that Homeland did not regularly permit employees to work from home for as long a period as Vogl had requested. (Id.) Mr. Ramper testified similarly, stating that Vogl's responsibilities as assistant director of the department required her to be in person and available to her staff. (Id., at 70).
Ultimately, Vogl's employment ended on October 6, 2017, when her FMLA leave expired. (Doc. 75-18, at 2). A letter from Nicol Brown informed Vogl that due to medical documentation that she provided, her medical leave request was denied, and because she was unable to return to full-time work upon the expiration of her FMLA leave, her employment was being terminated. (Id.) Following her termination, Vogl spoke with Brown to arrange to get her things from her office and turn in her computer and phone. (Doc. 75-26). Brown explained that it was necessary for staff to be there [*9]  to collect her laptop and phone and obtain signatures, and Sue Minarik and Deb Klinger were included on this email chain. (Id.)
Within this email chain, Ms. Minarik and Ms. Klinger appeared to voice some frustration about Vogl's availability to pick up her things. On this score, Ms. Brown, when proposing a date for Vogl to come in, replied to Ms. Klinger: "It could be a Monday if you prefer? I see no point in dragging this out." (Doc. 75-23, at 5). Ms. Minarik replied to another email regarding Vogl's schedule, stating: "I'm tired of this already! I am not doing this during the work day!!!!! Opinions???" (Doc. 75-26, at 4). Ms. Klinger agreed, stating: "There will be enough questions and remarks to deal with when the official email goes out. We do not need chaos during a work day." (Id., at 5). Klinger additionally replied that Sunday would work, stating: "As Barry implied, the least amount of conversation outside of HR, probably the better." (Id.) This email appears to be in reference to Mr. Ramper's October 6 email to Ms. Minarik, in which he stated: "In the best interest of all involved she should come after hours when no staff are present, i.e., 6PM. Deb, Sue and Laura should be [*10]  there. All involved should be very selective in all that is said for all's best interest." (Doc. 75-23, at 5).
Following her termination, Vogl filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") on July 19, 2018. (Doc. 1, ¶ 5). She received her Right to Sue letter on March 11, 2019. (Id., ¶ 6; Ex. A). She then filed the instant action on May 30, 2019. (Doc. 1). In her complaint, Vogl asserts that Homeland violated Title VII, the ADA, the FMLA, and the ADEA when it terminated her employment in 2017. Specifically, Vogl contends that she was terminated in retaliation for her opposition to the way the racial discrimination incident was handled. She further asserts that Homeland failed to accommodate her disability in good faith.
In their motion for summary judgment, the defendants contends that Vogl's claims fail as a matter of law. As we have noted, the plaintiff has not opposed summary judgment as to her FMLA and ADEA claims. With respect to her Title VII claim, Homeland argues that Vogl cannot show that her 2017 termination was causally connected to the October 2016 incident involving alleged racial discrimination. Additionally, the defendants contend that Vogl [*11]  was not disabled under the ADA, and further, that Homeland had a legitimate nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reason for terminating Vogl's employment.
This motion is fully briefed and is ripe for resolution. (Docs. 62, 63, 71, 72, 75, 78). For the reasons that follow, recognizing that issues of human motivation often entail disputed questions of fact which are not amenable to summary judgment, we recommend that the motion be granted with respect to the plaintiff's FMLA and ADEA claims but denied as to her Title VII and ADA claims.

III. Discussion

A. Motion for Summary Judgment — Standard of Review
The defendants have moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Through summary adjudication, a court is empowered to dispose of those claims that do not present a "genuine dispute as to any material fact," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and for which a trial would be "an empty and unnecessary formality." Univac Dental Co. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 702 F.Supp.2d 465, 468 (M.D. Pa. 2010). The substantive law identifies which facts are material, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of [*12]  the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis that would allow a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id., at 248-49.
The moving party has the initial burden of identifying evidence that it believes shows an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Conoshenti v. Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2004). Once the moving party has shown that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's claims, "the non-moving party must rebut the motion with facts in the record and cannot rest solely on assertions made in the pleadings, legal memoranda, or oral argument." Berckeley Inv. Group. Ltd. v. Colkitt, 455 F.3d 195, 201 (3d Cir. 2006), accord Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the non-moving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden at trial," summary judgment is appropriate. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. Summary judgment is also appropriate if the non-moving party provides merely colorable, conclusory, or speculative evidence. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. There must be more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the non-moving party and more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. Id., at 252; see also [*13]  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In making this determination, the Court must "consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Schs., 486 F.3d 791, 794 (3d Cir. 2007).
Moreover, a party who seeks to resist a summary judgment motion by citing to disputed material issues of fact must show by competent evidence that such factual disputes exist. Further, "only evidence which is admissible at trial may be considered in ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Countryside Oil Co., Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., 928 F. Supp. 474, 482 (D.N.J. 1995). Similarly, it is well-settled that: "[o]ne cannot create an issue of fact merely by . . . denying averments . . . without producing any supporting evidence of the denials." Thimons v. PNC Bank, NA, 254 F. App'x 896, 899 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Thus, "[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported . . ., an adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations or denial." Fireman's Ins. Co. of Newark New Jersey v. DuFresne, 676 F.2d 965, 968 (3d Cir. 1982); see Sunshine Books, Ltd. v. Temple University, 697 F.2d 90, 96 (3d Cir. 1982). "[A] mere denial is insufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact, and an unsubstantiated doubt as to the veracity of the opposing affidavit is also not sufficient." Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 458 (3d Cir. 1969). Furthermore, "a party resisting a [Rule 56] motion cannot expect to rely merely upon bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions." Gans v. Mundy, 762 F.2d 338, 341 (3d Cir. 1985) (citing Ness v. Marshall, 660 F.2d 517, 519 (3d Cir. 1981)).
Finally, it is emphatically not the province of the court to weigh evidence or assess credibility when passing upon a motion [*14]  for summary judgment. Rather, in adjudicating the motion, the court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the opposing party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). Where the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, then the non-movant's must be taken as true. Id. Additionally, the court is not to decide whether the evidence unquestionably favors one side or the other, or to make credibility determinations, but instead must decide whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1363. In reaching this determination, the Third Circuit has instructed that:
To raise a genuine issue of material fact . . . the opponent need not match, item for item, each piece of evidence proffered by the movant. In practical terms, if the opponent has exceeded the "mere scintilla" threshold and has offered a genuine issue of material fact, then the court cannot credit the movant's version of events against the opponent, even if the quantity of the movant's evidence far outweighs that of its opponent. It thus remains the province of the fact finder to ascertain [*15]  the believability and weight of the evidence.Id. In contrast, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); NAACP v. North Hudson Reg'l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d 464, 476 (3d Cir. 2011).
These principles apply with particular force to factual disputes which relate to matters of motive or intent. In this regard, it is well-settled that: "The motive or absence of motive of a party to engage in conduct alleged by another party is relevant to determining whether a genuine issue of fact exists. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 596, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)." Berda v. CBS Inc., 800 F.Supp. 1272, 1276 (W.D.Pa), aff'd., 975 F.2d 1548 (3d Cir. 1992).

B. The Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment Should be Granted in Part and Denied in Part.
The parties in this case have starkly competing views regarding fundamental questions of intent and motivation. In the instant case, the defendants move for summary judgment contending that Vogl's claims fail as a matter of law. On this score, Homeland asserts that Vogl's termination is not causally connected to the October 2016 racial discrimination incident, and moreover, that Homeland had a legitimate nonretaliatory reason to terminate Vogl's employment. Similarly, the defendants argue that Vogl was not disabled under the ADA, [*16]  and thus, it did not fail to accommodate a disability. However, it contends that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for her termination. Thus, the lynchpin of the defendants motion is their assertion that they acted out of a legitimate motive.
In contrast, Vogl asserts that it was longstanding animus against her for opposing racial bias, and not legitimate business justifications, that motivated the defendants as they considered her bereavement leave in the wake of her son's tragic death. Thus, the parties invite us, as a matter of law, to draw inferences regarding human motivation from a record which would permit competing inferences to be drawn.
For her part, as we have noted, Vogl has not opposed summary judgment as to her FMLA and ADEA claims, and so we will recommend that these claims be dismissed. However, after a review of the record, which we must consider in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, we conclude that Vogl has set forth sufficient evidence from which a factfinder could conclude that her termination was a pretext for retaliation, and that Homeland failed to accommodate Vogl in good faith. Accordingly, we will recommend that the motion be denied as to [*17]  the Title VII and ADA claims.

1. Title VII Retaliation
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from retaliating against an employee for his or her opposition to any practice made unlawful by Title VII. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). To make out a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show (1) that she engaged in protected activity; (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. Carvalho-Grevious v. Delaware State Univ., 851 F.3d 249, 257 (3d Cir. 2017). "With respect to 'protected activity,' the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII protects those who participate in certain Title VII proceedings (the 'participation clause') and those who oppose discrimination made unlawful by Title VII (the 'opposition clause')." Moore v. City of Phila., 461 F.3d 331, 341 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Slagle v. County of Clarion, 435 F.3d 262, 266 (3d Cir. 2006)). Regardless of the distinction between the two theories of retaliation, "the employee must hold an objectively reasonable belief, in good faith, that the activity they oppose is unlawful under Title VII." Id. (citing Clark County v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 271, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) (per curiam)).
Ultimately, a plaintiff bringing a Title VII retaliation claim must be able to show that her participation in protected activity was the but-for cause of any alleged adverse employment action that she suffered. Univ. of Texas v. Univ. of Tex. Southwestern Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013) ("Title VII retaliation [*18]  claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test stated in § 2000e-2(m). This requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer"); see also Grevious, 851 F.3d at 257 (noting that a plaintiff alleging Title VII retaliation "has a higher causal burden than a plaintiff asserting a claim of direct status-based discrimination under Title VII"). "The ultimate question in any retaliation case is an intent to retaliate vel non." Jensen v. Potter, 435 F.3d 444, 449 n.2 (3d Cir. 2006).
Title VII retaliation claims are subject to the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Thus, If the employee establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the employer to advance a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its conduct, and if the employer does so "the plaintiff must be able to convince the factfinder both that the employer's proffered explanation was false, and that retaliation was the real reason for the adverse employment action." Moore, 461 F.3d at 342 (quoting Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500-01 (3d Cir. 1997)).
In the instant case, Vogl asserts that she was terminated because she opposed the way Homeland handled the racial discrimination incident involving Ms. Brandt and Ms. Hardy. [*19]  In our view, casting the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, Vogl has made a prima facie showing that she engaged in protected activity, she suffered an adverse action, and that there was a causal connection between her protected activity and her termination. On this score, Vogl asserts that after she opposed the unlawful discrimination, she was subjected to constant meetings, at which she would be berated for her handling of the situation. Vogl emailed Sue Minarik about the frequency of these meetings, stating that she felt harassed ever since the October 2016 incident. Ms. Minarik responded that Vogl would be required to attend yet another meeting if she wished to remain the Assistant Director. In addition, following the October 2016 incident, Vogl was no longer trusted to hire social workers on her own; instead, she was told she needed to review the applicants with Nicol Brown and Mr. Ramper before selecting someone to hire.
Ultimately, Vogl's employment was terminated. While this happened about one year from the October 2016 incident, and thus, the temporal proximity is not so close in time as to suggest an inference of retaliatory motive, the Third Circuit has [*20]  found that "[w]hen temporal proximity between protected activity and allegedly retaliatory conduct is missing, courts may look to the intervening period for other evidence of retaliatory animus." Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d 271, 281 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting Krouse, 126 F.3d at 503) (internal quotations omitted). Given the evidence Vogl has put forward regarding the hostility she allegedly confronted, the constant meetings and questioning her judgment after the incident and after she opposed the way Homeland handled this racially charged incident, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that the opposition to discrimination was the ultimate cause of Vogl's termination.
While Homeland has proffered a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for Vogl's termination—the expiration of her FMLA leave—we conclude that there is sufficient evidence, when cast in a light most favorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party, that suggests that this reason may have been a pretext for retaliation. As we have described, Vogl was subjected to meeting after meeting following her opposition to the discriminatory incident. Ms. Brandt testified that Mr. Ramper was angry at the way Vogl handled the situation, particularly with respect to the Ethics [*21]  Committee's recommendations. Vogl stated that Mr. Ramper specifically called her professional judgment into question and told her she handled the situation in a way that put the agency at risk. Ultimately, it was Mr. Ramper's decision to deny Vogl's extended medical leave request. On this score, it is well settled that "[t]he motive or absence of motive of a party to engage in conduct alleged by another party is relevant to determining whether a genuine issue of fact exists." Berda v. CBS Inc., 800 F.Supp. 1272, 1276 (W. D. Pa), aff'd., 975 F.2d 1548 (3d Cir. 1992) (citing Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 596, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)).
Thus, at the summary judgment stage, where we must view the evidence in a light favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that there exists a question for a jury as to the motive behind Vogl's termination and whether it was in retaliation for her opposition to the racially discriminatory incident. Accordingly, the defendants' motion for summary judgment should be denied with respect to this Title VII retaliation claim.

2. ADA Failure to Accommodate
The purpose of the ADA is to "prevent employment discrimination of qualified individuals on account of their disability." Koller v. Riley Riper Hollin & Colagreco, 850 F. Supp. 2d 502, 512 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). The Act requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of [*22]  an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, unless the employer demonstrates that such accommodations would impose an undue hardship in the operation of their business." Id. (quoting Fleck v. WILMAC, Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54039, 2011 WL 1899198, at *4 (E.D. Pa. May 19, 2011) (internal quotations omitted).
On this score, to state a claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: 1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith. Moore v. CVS Rx Servs., Inc., 142 F.Supp.3d 321, 335 (M.D. Pa. 2015). "Reasonable accommodation" means measures such as "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, ... and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." Turner v. Hershey Chocolate USA, 440 F.3d 604, 608 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting § 12111(9)).
With respect to an employer's alleged burden resulting from a requested accommodation, undue hardships involve "significant difficulty or expense in, or resulting from, the provision of the accommodation." Bisker v. GGS Information Servs., Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, 2010 WL 2265979, at *2 (M.D. Pa. June 2, 2010) (quoting Walton v. Mental Health Ass'n of Southeastern Pennsylvania, 168 F.3d 661, 670 (3d Cir. 1999)) (quotation marks omitted); 29 C.F.R. § 1630, App. § 1630.2(p). [*23]  The plaintiff bears the initial burden of "identifying an accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits." Walton, 168 F.3d at 670. The burden then shifts to the defendant to either prove that "the accommodation is unreasonable or that it creates an undue hardship for the defendant." Id. Summary judgment is thus only appropriate where the plaintiff's proposal "is either clearly ineffective or outlandishly costly." Bisker, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, 2010 WL 2265979, at *2 (quoting Walton, 168 F.3d at 670) (quotation marks omitted).
In the instant case, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that the accommodation that Vogl requested was unreasonable, or that the alleged burden on the defendant would be "clearly ineffective or outlandishly costly." Vogl requested to return to work in a hybrid fashion following the expiration of the FMLA leave, working part time in the office and part time from home. While Mr. Ramper testified that Vogl's position required in-person work, Vogl has proffered that other employees were granted accommodations for temporary leave or to work from home for a temporary time period. Finally, as we have noted the ADA requires a good faith effort at accommodation, and there is a factual dispute concerning the motivations of the parties [*24]  which cannot be resolved as a matter of law. Thus, in our view, there is a dispute of material fact regarding whether Vogl's request for an accommodation was unreasonable, and whether the burden on Homeland to honor the accommodation request was undue.
Moreover, given the evidence of pretextual reasons for Vogl's termination, we further conclude that this evidence casts doubt on Homeland's good faith in meeting with Vogl to determine what might have constituted a reasonable accommodation in her situation. Thus, given these factual disputes and ambiguities, and mindful of our duty to construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, we recommend that summary judgment be denied with respect to this ADA claim.

IV. Recommendation
For the foregoing reasons, IT IS RECOMMENDED that the defendant's motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 62), be GRANTED as to the plaintiff's ADEA and FMLA claims but DENIED with respect to the Title VII and ADA claims.
The parties are hereby placed on notice that pursuant to Local Rule 72.3:
Any party may object to a magistrate judge's proposed findings, recommendations, or report addressing a motion or matter described in 28 U.S.C. § 636 (b)(1)(B) or making a recommendation [*25]  for the disposition of a prisoner case or a habeas corpus petition within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy thereof. Such party shall file with the clerk of court, and serve on the magistrate judge and all parties, written objections which shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings, recommendations or report to which objection is made and the basis for such objections. The briefing requirements set forth in Local Rule 72.2 shall apply. A judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made and may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge, however, need conduct a new hearing only in his or her discretion or where required by law, and may consider the record developed before the magistrate judge, making his or her own determination on the basis of that record. The judge may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses, or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.
