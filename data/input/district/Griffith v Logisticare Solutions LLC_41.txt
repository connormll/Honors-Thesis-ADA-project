CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): Order GRANTING Defendant's Motion to Dismiss WITH LEAVE TO AMEND
Before the Court is Defendant Logisticare Solutions, LLC's motion to dismiss Plaintiff Raven Griffith's First Amended Complaint ("FAC"), or, in the alternative, to strike superfluous allegations. See Dkts. # 18, 19 (amended motion). The Court finds the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. After considering the papers, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. Plaintiff may file a Second Amended Complaint consistent with this Order no later than April 7, 2017. Because the Court dismisses all the allegations for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court does not reach Defendant's motion to strike superfluous allegations.
I. Background
Plaintiff Raven Griffith, a Belizean woman, was employed by Defendant Logisticare Solutions, LLC from March 31, 2014 to September 11, 2015. See FAC ¶ 13. While employed by the Defendant, Plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to "severe and pervasive" [*2]  racial comments because of her "darker skin." See id. ¶ 14. Experiencing these comments allegedly caused Plaintiff to develop an anxiety disorder, including loss and shortness of breath. Id. ¶¶ 17-18. Plaintiff visited a doctor for her anxiety and provided Defendant with a doctor's note, but Defendant nonetheless wrote Plaintiff up for missing work. Id. ¶ 19. She requested additional time off but was allegedly denied. Id. ¶ 22. After her visit to the doctor, employees allegedly told Plaintiff that she was "playing the victim." Id. ¶ 20. When Plaintiff complained to Defendant about the comments, Defendant allegedly gave Plaintiff less desirable work, yelled and falsely accused Plaintiff of poor performance, and wrote up Plaintiff unfairly. Id. ¶¶ 20-24. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant created "false reasons" for her termination, and that the real reasons for her termination were race and disability discrimination, and retaliation for Plaintiff's complaints of harassment. Id. ¶¶ 23-25.
Plaintiff filed a claim with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and received a right-to-sue letter. Id. ¶ 9. Plaintiff then filed this lawsuit in the Superior Court of California [*3]  on September 20, 2016. See Notice of Removal, Dkt. # 1, ¶ 1. Defendant removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction on November 21, 2016. See id.
The operative complaint is the FAC, filed on December 28, 2016. Dkt. # 13. It asserts nineteen causes of action for: (1) race/color discrimination in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), (2) race/color discrimination in violation of public policy, (3) retaliation for complaints of race/color discrimination and/or harassment in violation of FEHA, (4) retaliation for complaints of race/color discrimination and/or harassment in violation of public policy, (5) race/color harassment in violation of FEHA, (6) disability discrimination in violation of FEHA, (7) disability discrimination in violation of public policy, (8) disability harassment in violation of FEHA, (9) retaliation for complaints of disability discrimination and/or harassment in violation of FEHA, (10) retaliation for complaints of disability discrimination and/or harassment in violation of public policy, (11) family and medical leave discrimination/interference in violation of FEHA, (12) family and medical leave discrimination/interference [*4]  in violation of public policy, (13) retaliation for requests for family and medical leave, complaints of family and medical leave discrimination, and/or harassment in violation of FEHA, (14) retaliation for request for family and medical leave, complaints of family and medical leave, discrimination and/or harassment in violation of public policy, (15) tortious discharge against public policy relating to employees who make reports of workplace injuries, (16) failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA, (17) failure to accommodate in violation of FEHA, (18) failure to do everything reasonably necessary to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation from occurring in violation of FEHA, and (19) failure to take immediate appropriate action to stop harassment. See generally FAC.
Defendant now moves to dismiss all the causes of action in the FAC as conclusory and failing to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). See Motion to Dismiss ("Mot."), 1-5. Defendant also moves to strike paragraphs 26-280 of the FAC, which lay out Plaintiff's causes of action, as redundant and irrelevant. See id. 5:15-17. Plaintiff opposes the motion. See Opposition ("Opp."), Dkt. # 20.
II. Legal Standard [*5] 
A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests whether the complaint "contain[s] sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). When deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must accept the facts pleaded in the complaint as true, and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Faulkner v. ADT Sec. Servs., Inc., 706 F.3d 1017, 1019 (9th Cir. 2013); Cousins v. Lockyer, 568 F.3d 1063, 1067-68 (9th Cir. 2009). The Court, however, is not required to accept "legal conclusions . . . cast in the form of factual allegations." W. Mining Council v. Watt, 643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir. 1981); see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.
After accepting all non-conclusory allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, the court must determine whether the complaint alleges a plausible claim to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679-80. "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. . . . The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Id. at 678.
III. Discussion
FEHA prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of, inter alia, race, color, and physical and mental disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). The California Family Rights Act ("CFRA") [*6]  is a portion of FEHA that allows eligible employees to take unpaid medical leave to care for themselves or a sick family member. Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2. Plaintiff asserts eighteen of her nineteen causes of action under FEHA, and one tort law cause of action (tortious discharge) under various sections of the California Labor Code. Although Plaintiff asserts that some of Defendant's conduct is in "violation of public policy," the Court construes these "public policy" claims as FEHA claims because the only "public policy" alleged in these causes of action is FEHA. See FAC ¶¶ 42, 68, 113, 160, 188, 217.
The Court groups Plaintiff's nineteen causes of action into eight sections: (A) race/color discrimination, (B) disability discrimination, (C) harassment, (D) retaliation, (E) medical leave interference and retaliation, (F) failure to engage in interactive process and to provide reasonable accommodations, (G) failure to stop harassment, and (H) tortious discharge. Because the Court ultimately GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss all the causes of action in the FAC, the Court concludes by discussing whether to grant leave to amend, and does not reach Defendant's motion to strike, which is rendered moot by this [*7]  Order.
A. Claims One and Two: Race/Color Discrimination
Plaintiff's first and second claims are for race and color discrimination under FEHA. To state a claim for race and color discrimination under FEHA, Plaintiff must assert sufficient facts to state a prima facie claim that she (1) was a member of a protected class, (2) was qualified for the position sought or was performing competently in the position held, (3) had suffered an adverse employment action, such as a termination, and (4) the action occurred under circumstances suggesting discriminatory motive, such as a person outside of the protected class being treated more favorably. Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000).
Here, the FAC fails because it does not assert sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that Plaintiff performed competently in the position, or that her termination occurred under circumstances suggesting discriminatory motive. The only allegation that Plaintiff makes about her performance appears in paragraph 25 of the FAC where Plaintiff alleges that she "was a competent employee and was terminated for a false reason." FAC ¶ 25. This allegation is insufficient because it is a legal conclusion, not a fact. Plaintiff does not allege, for example, [*8]  that she received positive performance reviews or past promotions, and she does not state the types of activities that her job entails. Without knowing anything about Plaintiff's job or the employer's business, the Court is at a loss as to how to determine whether Plaintiff was qualified to perform the job. Plaintiff must assert additional facts to put Defendant on notice and to facilitate discovery around whether, in fact, Plaintiff could competently perform the position that she held. As it currently stands, however, the FAC provides Defendant with no notice of the factual basis for Plaintiff's allegation that she was a "competent" employee. The allegations thus fail as conclusory and incomplete.
The FAC also fails to plead sufficient factual allegations to state a plausible claim that Plaintiff was terminated under circumstances suggesting discriminatory motive. The only allegations in the FAC about the termination are in paragraphs 24 and 25 where Plaintiff alleges that Defendant asserted "false reasons . . . to hide the true, illegal reason for her termination." See FAC ¶¶ 24-25. These allegations too are conclusory. The FAC makes no factual allegations about the termination. At [*9]  this phase, Plaintiff does not even offer basic facts about the termination, including which of Defendant's employees communicated with Plaintiff about the termination and what Defendant proffered as the reason for the termination. Even Plaintiff's allegations about the comments made by other employees alone do not suffice to establish the employer's discriminatory motive because the Plaintiff makes no mention of whether the employees played a role in the termination decision or whether the employer was aware of the conduct.
Given the above, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for race or color discrimination under FEHA. The Court thus GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss claims one and two.
B. Claims Six and Seven: Disability Discrimination
Plaintiff's sixth and seventh claims are for disability discrimination. FAC ¶¶ 94-127. To establish disability discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must assert sufficient facts to state a plausible claim that she "(1) suffered from a disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability, (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because [*10]  of the disability or perceived disability." Wills v. Superior Court, 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 159-60, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To satisfy the third element of a disability discrimination claim, the plaintiff's disability must have been a "substantial motivating factor in the particular employment decision." Harris v. Santa Monica, 56 Cal. 4th 203, 232, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 294 P.3d 49 (2013).
Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a claim under the second and third prongs of the FEHA disability discrimination test. Again, the FAC asserts only that Plaintiff "was a competent employee and was terminated for a false reason." FAC ¶ 25. This allegation is conclusory because it merely asserts the legal conclusion that the Plaintiff wishes the Court to reach without offering any factual basis for the conclusion. Twombly and Iqbal explicitly reject such allegations, which "amount to nothing more than a 'formulaic recitation of the elements' of a constitutional discrimination claim." See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681 (citing Twombly). Even if the Court were to find that Plaintiff pled sufficient facts to assert a disability because of her anxiety, Plaintiff has offered no factual allegations to support a claim that Plaintiff could perform the essential duties of her job or that she was terminated because of her disability. The [*11]  FAC does not even allege the "pretextual" reason that the employer offered for the termination.
Plaintiff has therefore failed to state a claim for disability discrimination under FEHA. Defendant's motion to dismiss claims six and seven is GRANTED.
C. Claims Five and Eight: Harassment
Plaintiff's fifth and eighth claims are for race, color, and disability harassment under FEHA. See FAC ¶¶ 128-43. To state a prima facie case for harassment, a plaintiff must allege that she (1) was a member of a protected class, (2) was subjected to unwelcome harassment, (3) the harassment was based on race, color, or disability; (4) the harassment unreasonably interfered with her work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (5) the employer is liable for the harassment. See Thompson v. City of Monrovia, 186 Cal. App. 4th 860, 876, 112 Cal. Rptr. 3d 377 (2010).
Under FEHA, "harassment consists of conduct outside the scope of necessary job performance, conduct presumably engaged in for personal gratification, because of meanness or bigotry, or for other personal motives." Roby v. McKesson Corp., 47 Cal. 4th 686, 707, 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 773, 219 P.3d 749 (2009) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Harassment is "generally concerned with the message conveyed to an employee, and therefore with the social environment of the [*12]  workplace, whereas discrimination is concerned with explicit changes in the terms or conditions of employment." Id. For harassment to be actionable, "it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive 'to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.'" Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., 21 Cal.4th 121, 130, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 132, 980 P.2d 846 (1999) (quoting Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986)). "Harassment cannot be occasional, isolated, sporadic or trivial; rather, the plaintiff must show a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated, routine or generalized nature." Id. at 130-31; see also Christ v. Staples, Inc., No. CV 14-07784 MMM (JEMx), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6243, 2015 WL 248075, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 20, 2015) (quoting Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal. 4th 1035, 1043, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009)).
Plaintiff's harassment allegations are insufficient because, as plead, they do not describe conduct that is "sufficiently severe or pervasive." Plaintiff alleges that she "was subjected to unwanted racial comments because she was from Belize and had darker skin" and that other employees said that Plaintiff was "playing a victim" when she requested sick leave. See FAC ¶¶ 14, 20. As alleged, these instances are not sufficient to state a claim for harassment. Plaintiff does not allege how frequently the comments occurred, who made them, when they were made, or when management came to know about them. As to her claim of racial harassment, Plaintiff does not [*13]  even describe the content of the "comments" made about her race. Because Plaintiff has not plead sufficient facts to raise a plausible inference that the comments would interfere with a reasonable employee's work performance, or to put Defendant on notice of the factual basis for the claims, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for race- and color-based or disability harassment.
The Court therefore GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's harassment claims (Claims Five and Eight).
D. Claims Three, Four, Nine, and Ten: Retaliation for Filing Disability/Race Complaints
Plaintiff's third, fourth, ninth, and tenth claims are for retaliation under FEHA. See generally FAC. To assert a prima facie retaliation claim under FEHA, "the plaintiff must show that [s]he engaged in a protected activity, [her] employer subjected [her] to adverse employment action, and there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." Strother v. S. Cal. Permanente Med. Grp., 79 F.3d 859, 868 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing Flait v. North Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal.App.4th 467, 476, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992)). "Protected activity" means that the employee "has opposed any practices forbidden under [FEHA] . . . or has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under [FEHA]." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(h). Plaintiff's retaliation claims fail because Plaintiff [*14]  has not alleged sufficient facts to establish that she engaged in a protected activity, or that there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action.
Plaintiff makes two allegations about "protected activity." First, she asserts that she requested time off of work to visit a doctor for her anxiety disorder, and additional time off to recover. See FAC ¶ 22. Second, she asserts that she filed "complaints of harassment." Id. ¶ 23. Both allegations are lacking. Turning to the second allegation first, the Court finds this allegation deficient because it is conclusory and lacking in factual support. Plaintiff does not assert when she filed the complaints, who she filed them with, or how regularly she filed complaints. Because the allegation as plead asserts only a legal conclusion, it is insufficient to state a claim that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity.
Plaintiff's allegation about her request for time off is similarly deficient. Plaintiff asserts that the request for time off is a request for reasonable accommodations that qualifies as a "protected activity" under FEHA. See Opp. 13:6-14:26. Although Plaintiff is correct about current FEHA law, Plaintiff [*15]  is incorrect about the law at the time that Plaintiff alleges that the conduct in this case occurred. The California legislature amended FEHA on January 1, 2016 to provide protection for retaliation when an individual makes a request for reasonable accommodations, see Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 245-46, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016), but such was not the law at the time that Plaintiff alleges that the conduct in this case occurred. In 2014 and 2015, California courts followed the rule that a "request for an accommodation, without more, was insufficient to constitute 'protected activity.'" See, e.g., Rope v. Auto Chlor Sys. of Wash., Inc., 220 Cal. App. 4th 635, 652, 163 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392 (2013), superseded by statute as recognized in Moore, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 245-46. In Moore, the court held that the legislature's 2016 FEHA amendments did not apply retroactively. See Moore, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 247 ("Because the recent amendment is prospective in application, in 2011, at the time Moore alleges Defendant engaged in the asserted retaliation, the law was consistent with the holding in Rope . . . [a]s a result, Moore cannot base her claim for retaliation under FEHA on her alleged request for an accommodation, i.e., her request for time off for surgery."). Thus, Moore concluded that, because the conduct alleged in the complaint occurred before January 1, 2016, Rope applies, and Plaintiff's request for reasonable [*16]  accommodation was not a protected activity. Because the conduct in Griffith's complaint, like the conduct in Moore, occurred in 2014 and 2015 before the legislative changes, the Court follows Moore and concludes that Plaintiff's request for time off is not a protected activity.
Because Plaintiff has made only conclusory allegations about her protected activity, or has alleged activities that were not considered "protected" at the time the conduct occurred, Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to show that she engaged in protected activity. Plaintiff's allegations as to the causal link between the protected activity and the termination are similarly deficient. In the Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the "corresponding timing of events" establishes that the protected activity caused the termination, but the FAC alleges nothing about timing. See Opp. 12:26-28. Reading it, it is impossible to tell when Plaintiff requested time off or made her complaints of harassment, and how soon thereafter Defendant made the decision to terminate her from employment.
In sum, the FAC is far too conclusory to state a claim for retaliation under FEHA. The Court therefore GRANTS Defendant's motion to [*17]  dismiss.
E. Claims Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, and Fourteen: Medical Leave Interference and Retaliation
Plaintiff's eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth causes of action are for medical leave interference and retaliation under FEHA. CFRA is the section of FEHA that addresses medical leave claims. CFRA makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer of fifty or more persons to refuse to grant a request by an "eligible employee" to take up to 12 workweeks in any 12-month period for family care and medical leave. Cal. Gov. Code § 12945.2(c). To be eligible for CFRA protection, the claimant must be an "employee with more than 12 months of service with the employer, and who has at least 1,250 hours of service with the employer during the previous 12-month period." Id. "Violations of . . . CFRA generally fall into two types of claims: (1) 'interference' claims in which an employee alleges that an employer denied or interfered with her substantive rights to protected medical leave, and (2) 'retaliation' claims in which an employee alleges that she suffered an adverse employment action for exercising her right to CFRA leave." Bareno v. San Diego Cmty. College Dist., 7 Cal. App. 5th 546, 558-59, 212 Cal. Rptr. 3d 682 (2017) (citing Rogers v. Cty. of L.A., 198 Cal. App. 4th 480, 487-88, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 350 (2011)). Plaintiff here alleges both interference and retaliation CFRA claims. [*18] 
As an initial matter, the FAC fails to state a claim for CFRA protection because the FAC fails to establish that CFRA applies to this case. The Complaint contains no allegations that Defendant employs fifty or more people. Also, because the FAC does not allege when Plaintiff developed the anxiety disorder or requested time off to visit the doctor, it does not state how long Plaintiff was in the "service" of her employer before she filed her request, and does not assert that Plaintiff worked more than 1,250 hours during the 12-month period prior to the request. Absent additional facts, the Court cannot conclude that Defendant is covered under CFRA, or that Plaintiff is an eligible employee.
Even if CFRA applies, Plaintiff has not stated an interference claim. A CFRA interference claim "consists of the following elements: (1) the employee's entitlement to CFRA leave rights; and (2) the employer's interference with or denial of those rights." Moore, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 250. "Interference" includes "not only refusing to authorize [] leave, but discouraging an employee from using such leave." Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1133 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(b) and instructing courts to interpret CFRA in the same way as the FMLA). An employer cannot "use the taking of [] leave [*19]  as a negative factor in employment actions." See id. Although the FAC alleges that Plaintiff "was written up" for visiting the doctor and that Plaintiff was "treated negatively in response to her requests," FAC ¶¶ 19, 22, these statements are too conclusory to state a claim for interference. Without additional facts, the Court cannot conclude that the employer used the "write up" as a negative factor in its employment decision. Also, the statement that Plaintiff was treated "negatively" is conclusory because it simply asserts a legal conclusion without a basis in fact. Therefore, even if Plaintiff plead sufficient facts to show that CFRA applies, the FAC would still not allege sufficient facts to assert an interference claim under CFRA.
Plaintiff also fails to state a claim for retaliation. "The elements of a cause of action for retaliation in violation of CFRA are: '(1) the defendant was an employer covered by CFRA; (2) the employee was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, fine, or suspension, because of her right to [*20]  CFRA [leave]." Bareno, 7 Cal. App. 5th at 560. The Court has already pointed out that the FAC fails to satisfy the first and second prongs of the test by failing to show that Defendant is covered under FEHA and that Plaintiff is eligible for coverage. The FAC also does not allege sufficient facts to support the fourth prong. Plaintiff asserts that she was "written up" for missing work, but does not provide any additional facts to show how this write up interacted with the employer's later decision to terminate Plaintiff. See FAC ¶ 19. Without additional facts about the causal link, the Complaint is deficient.
In light of the above, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims of interference and retaliation under CFRA.
F. Claims Sixteen, Seventeen, and Eighteen: Failure to Engage in a Timely, Good Faith, Interactive Process to Determine Reasonable Accommodations, and Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations
Plaintiff's sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth claims are for failure to timely and in good faith engage in the interactive process and for failure to provide reasonable accommodations. FAC ¶¶ 243-74. Plaintiff asserts that she requested reasonable accommodations when she requested [*21]  time off of work to seek treatment and to recover from a severe anxiety disorder, and that Defendant's denial of the request was unreasonable.
FEHA requires employers "to engage in a timely, good faith, and interactive process with [a disabled] employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodations by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). This requires "communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identify[ing] an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008).
A reasonable accommodation is "a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal.-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1010, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "A term of leave from work can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA, and therefore, a request for leave can be considered to be a request for accommodation under FEHA." Moore, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 243 (citing Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999)). To assert a claim for failure to provide reasonable accommodations, the plaintiff must assert that (1) she has a disability covered by FEHA; (2) she [*22]  is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position; and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability. Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal.-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1010, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). To prevail on a claim under this section, "[a]n employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1009-10.
Plaintiff fails to state a claim for reasonable accommodations or failure to engage in an interactive process because the facts, as plead, do not establish whether Plaintiff's request for time off was reasonable, and whether Plaintiff was otherwise qualified to perform the functions of the position. The Court has already addressed the deficiencies in Plaintiff's claim that she was capable of performing the "essential functions" of the job. Plaintiff also fails to show that her request for time off was reasonable. Although the allegations in the FAC might suffice to establish that Defendant knew about Plaintiff's disability, Plaintiff must plead additional facts to establish that Plaintiff's request for accommodations was reasonable, and that Defendant nonetheless denied the accommodation. For example, she provides no information about the timing of the [*23]  request, when Defendant denied it, or about how much time off she requested. Without these additional facts, the Complaint fails to put Defendant on notice of the nature of the violation, and is too conclusory to proceed.
The Court therefore GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth claims in the FAC.
G. Claim Nineteen: Failure to Stop Harassment
FEHA holds employers liable for failing to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination, and harassment. See Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(k). Plaintiff cannot assert a failure to stop claim without successfully pleading a predicate claim for harassment, discrimination or retaliation. Because Plaintiff cannot state a claim for harassment, "[her] claim for failure to prevent harassment also fails." Harris v. Lynwood Unified School Dist., No. CV 07-05058 DDP (CTx), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87655, 2009 WL 2900313 at *7 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2009); see also Trujillo v. N. Cnty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal.App.4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998) ("[T]here's no logic that says an employee who has not been discriminated against can sue an employer for not preventing discrimination that didn't happen, for not having a policy to prevent discrimination when no discrimination occurred . . ."). The Court therefore GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Claim Nineteen for failure to stop harassment.
H. Claim Fifteen: [*24]  Tortious Discharge
Plaintiff's fifteenth cause of action is for tortious discharge in violation of public policy. FAC ¶¶ 228-42. In California, at will employees may bring a tort action for wrongful discharge if their employer discharges them for a reason that violates fundamental public policy. See Nelson v. United Techs., 74 Cal. App. 4th 597, 608, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 239 (1999) (citing Tameny v. Atl. Richfield Co., 27 Cal. 3d 167, 176, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330 (1980)). The availability of the tort helps prevent employers from using the threat of termination to coerce employees to conceal wrongful acts or engage in conduct harmful to the public welfare. See id. Here, Plaintiff's claims are identical to her claims of retaliation. Plaintiff asserts that she engaged in a "protected activity" of complaining of "workplace injury" and that she was terminated because of the "protected activity." Id. ¶¶ 234-41. She asserts that various sections of the California Labor Code embody a public policy of "assuring safe and healthful work conditions for all California working men and women." Id. ¶ 231. Because the Court has already established that Plaintiff has failed to adequately allege a "protected activity" or a causal link between her complaints of harassment and her termination, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss this cause of action without [*25]  further discussion.
I. Leave to Amend
Because the Court dismisses the FAC in its entirety, the Court must decide whether to grant Plaintiff leave to file a Second Amended Complaint ("SAC"). "Generally, [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 15 advises the court that 'leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.' This policy is 'to be applied with extreme liberality.'" Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1051 (9th Cir. 2001). Factors such as "undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [and] futility of amendment" may be considered in making this determination. Id. at 1052 (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962)). Plaintiff requests leave to amend. Opp. 19:14-20:13.
Here, Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff should be granted leave to amend and to file a SAC. See Reply 14:2-5. The Court concurs. Because Plaintiff could theoretically state a claim against her former employer by asserting additional facts, leave to amend is not futile. Moreover, although Plaintiff has already once amended the Complaint, Plaintiff has not yet had the benefit of addressing the specific issues raised by the Court. Accordingly, the Court will grant leave to [*26]  amend.
IV. Conclusion
Plaintiff asserted nineteen causes of action against her former employer. Because the Complaint's allegations are conclusory or otherwise deficient, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss all nineteen causes of action. Plaintiff may file a SAC consistent with this Order no later than April 7, 2017. If Plaintiff does not file a SAC by that date, the Court will dismiss the action with prejudice.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
