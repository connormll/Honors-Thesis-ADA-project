Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION AND ORDER
The above-styled matter is before the court on the following motions:
(1) Defendant Lockheed Martin Corporation's motion for summary judgment [Doc. 37]; and
(2) Plaintiff's motion for sanctions against Defendant Lockheed Martin Corporation and defense counsel [Doc. 57].
For the reasons stated below, I RECOMMEND that Defendant's motion for summary judgment [Doc. 37] be GRANTED. Plaintiff's motion for sanctions [Doc. 57] is DENIED.

I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff Rasheed Oshodi ("Plaintiff") currently has two employment discrimination lawsuits pending in this court against his present employer, Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Defendant" or "Lockheed Martin"). Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit on May 19, 2009, contesting his placement on an unpaid medical leave of absence and subsequent [*2]  appointment to a different position. [Case No. 1:09-cv-1341-JEC-GGB, Doc. 1, complaint]. In his complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Lockheed Martin violated his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), the Rehabilitation Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA").
During the course of the litigation, Plaintiff conducted some written discovery, but took no depositions. Plaintiff also failed to file any certificates of service of discovery with the court as required by Local Rule 26.3(A). The extended discovery period closed on March 11, 2010. Pursuant to this court's order (by docket entry only) granting the parties' motions to extend the due date for filing motions for summary judgment [Docs. 33 & 34], Lockheed Martin timely filed its motion for summary judgment on April 16, 2010. [Doc. 37]. Plaintiff filed his response in opposition on May 17, 2010. [Doc. 46]. Lockheed Martin filed its reply brief on June 3, 2010. [Doc. 50]. Immediately thereafter, Plaintiff's counsel, with Plaintiff's consent, filed motions to withdraw, which were granted on July 1, 2010. [Doc. 56]. Since then, Plaintiff has been proceeding [*3]  pro se.
On April 26, 2010, Plaintiff (proceeding pro se) initiated a second lawsuit against Lockheed Martin, based on a second EEOC charge of discrimination that he had filed and notice of right to sue issued by the EEOC. [See Oshodi v. Lockheed Martin Corp., No. 1:10-cv-1239-JEC-GGB, Doc. 1]. That related action remains pending before this court. Unless otherwise noted, Plaintiff's second lawsuit is not addressed in this Report and Recommendation.

II. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
On July 6, 2010, Plaintiff (proceeding pro se) filed in the case presently before this court [Case No. 1:09-cv-1341] a motion for sanctions [Doc. 57] against Lockheed Martin and its lead counsel, Richard M. Escoffery, pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In his motion for sanctions, Plaintiff accuses Defendant and its counsel of seeking to mislead and confuse the court by willfully providing inconsistent, false and falsified documents "intended to suppress true events and facts of the case," including "the suppression of all witnesses, statements and depositions." [Doc. 57 at 1-2]. Based on the alleged misconduct, Plaintiff asks the court to dismiss Defendant's motion for summary judgment and to impose other unspecified sanctions. [*4]  In addition, Plaintiff contends that Defendant's earlier request for an extension of ten days to file its summary judgment motion (because one of Lockheed Martin's defense attorneys had not yet returned from maternity leave) was merely a ruse to add late-signed declarations to its motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 57-1 at 2].
Lockheed Martin has filed a response in opposition to Plaintiff's motion for sanctions [Doc. 60], arguing that the motion should be denied on numerous grounds, including: (1) Plaintiff failed to comply with Rule 11's service and "safe harbor" requirements prior to filing his motion with the court; (2) Plaintiff to date has never served his motion for sanctions on Defendant, as required by Rule 11; (3) by failing to diligently pursue discovery during the extended discovery period, Plaintiff and his former counsel are solely responsible for failing to take the depositions that Plaintiff asserts Lockheed Martin has somehow "suppressed"; (4) Plaintiff has failed to show that Defendant has presented any false or misleading medical records; (5) Plaintiff has failed to show that Defendant improperly withheld any discoverable documents or otherwise failed to comply with its obligations [*5]  during discovery; and (6) Plaintiff's motion amounts to nothing more than an improper surreply through which Plaintiff attempts to rebut the testimony offered in support of Lockheed Martin's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff has not filed a reply brief in conjunction with his motion for sanctions refuting or attempting to refute Lockheed Martin's arguments. The time has run for filing a reply.

A. Legal Standard
Under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, sanctions are properly assessed when: (1) a party files a pleading that has no reasonable factual basis; (2) a party files a pleading based on a legal theory that has no reasonable chance of success and cannot be advanced as a reasonable argument to change existing law; or (3) a party files a pleading in bad faith for an improper purpose. Thompson v. RelationServe Media, Inc., 610 F.3d 628, 637 n.12 (11th Cir. 2010)(citing Massengale v. Ray, 267 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir. 2001)). See also Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1106 (11th Cir. 2001) (noting that Rule 11 "is aimed primarily at pleadings" and addresses the conduct of both parties and attorneys).

B. Discussion
Applying this standard, I find that Plaintiff's motion for sanctions should be denied. After careful review and consideration of Plaintiff's motion, Defendant's response in opposition, and the arguments contained therein, I find that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Lockheed Martin and/or [*6]  Mr. Escoffery (1) filed a pleading that has no reasonable factual basis; (2) filed a pleading based on a legal theory that has no reasonable chance of success and cannot be advanced as a reasonable argument to change existing law; or (3) filed a pleading in bad faith for an improper purpose. Thompson, 610 F.3d at 637 n.12.
In addition, Rule 11(c)(2) provides that before filing a motion for sanctions with the court, the party bringing the motion must first serve the motion on the party or parties that allegedly violated the rule or that are responsible for the violation, as required under Rule 5. Rule 5 requires the movant to include a certificate of service which identifies the document served, the date of service and the manner of delivery. Second, a motion for Rule 11 sanctions may not be filed with the court until 21 days after service upon the opposing party. Montoya v. Emergency Ice LLC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44995, 2009 WL 1362619, at *1 (S.D. Fla. 2009). The purpose of the Rule 11(c)(2) "safe harbor" provision is to allow the alleged offender to withdraw or correct "the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial" within the 21-day time frame. Id. If the document is withdrawn or corrected, the motion for Rule 11 sanctions may not be filed with the court and no sanctions may be imposed. Id.
Here, Plaintiff has not shown that he made any efforts [*7]  to comply with the service and "safe harbor" requirements of Rules 5 and 11. On that basis alone, Plaintiff's failure to comply with the procedural requirements precludes the imposition of the requested sanctions. See Brickwood Contractors, Inc. v. Datanet Eng'g, Inc., 369 F.3d 385, 396 (4th Cir. 2004)(concluding that the safe-harbor provisions of Rule 11 are inflexible claim-processing rules and that a district court exceeds its authority by imposing sanctions requested through a procedurally-deficient Rule 11 motion); see also Dzwonkowski v. Dzwonkowski, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103622, 2008 WL 2163916, at *30 & n.7 (S.D. Ala. 2008)(listing other circuits that have reached the same conclusion). Plaintiff has also failed to refute or controvert Defendant's arguments that Plaintiff's motion is procedurally deficient. In this circuit, such inaction supports a finding of abandonment. See Hudson v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 209 F. Supp. 2d 1301, 1324 (N.D. Ga. 2001)(providing that "[w]hen a party fails to respond to an argument or otherwise address a claim, the Court deems such argument or claim abandoned.")(citing Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995)(other citation omitted)); Bowden ex rel. Bowden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 124 F. Supp. 2d 1228, 1236 (M.D. Ala. 2000) ("It is not for the court to manufacture arguments on Plaintiff's behalf").
Even if Plaintiff had satisfied the procedural requirements of Rules 5 and 11, his motion is still due to be denied based on his failure to demonstrate why or how the alleged inconsistencies, errors, omissions or variations in documents, declarations, [*8]  and other testimony proffered in support of Defendant's motion for summary judgment warrant the imposition of sanctions, under Rule 11. For example, Plaintiff accuses Lockheed Martin of falsifying documents, as evidenced by its production of two different versions of its Medical Department's office notes concerning Plaintiff. [See "Employee Medical Record," Oshodi Dep. Ex. 19, and Ex. B to the declaration of Cheryl Larsgaard]. However, Plaintiff's conclusion that the documents were deliberately falsified suffers from a complete lack of factual support. An equally if not more plausible explanation for why Exhibit 19 contains one additional entry is that it is a later-generated printout of the Medical Department's notes. Speculation about inconsistencies does not provide a sufficient basis for imposing sanctions.
Plaintiff also suggests that Defendant has in some way obstructed the discovery process by attaching declarations to its motion for summary judgment of a person or persons that Plaintiff believes should have been deposed. [Doc. 57-1 at 5]. The record reflects, however, that during the discovery period, Plaintiff made no attempt to notice or take any depositions during the initial or [*9]  extended discovery periods; nor did he seek a conference with the court to discuss any discovery disputes or file a motion to compel discovery pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Nor has Plaintiff asked for relief pursuant to Rule 56(f) or followed the procedures specified in that rule since Defendant filed its motion for summary judgment.1 See Harbert Int'l v. James, 157 F.3d 1271, 1280 (11th Cir. 1998)("A Rule 56(f) motion must be supported by an affidavit which sets forth with particularity the facts the moving party expects to discover and how those facts would create a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment."). Plaintiff has also failed to identify what "witnesses" Defendant has allegedly "suppressed," and how the anticipated testimony would create a genuine issue of material fact on any of his claims. Nor has Plaintiff explained why he did not make use of the various discovery mechanisms available to obtain this material or testimony, such as depositions and/or a motion to compel. Thus, Plaintiff has made no showing that would justify relief based on the alleged "suppression of all witnesses, statements and depositions" by Defendant during either the original or extended discovery period. Plaintiff's remaining arguments are [*10]  similarly unsupported and unavailing.

C. Conclusion
For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff's motion for sanctions [Doc. 57] is DENIED.

III. DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Also pending before the court is Defendant Lockheed Martin's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's employment discrimination complaint. Plaintiff's complaint states five causes of action against Lockheed Martin. In Counts I and IV, Plaintiff alleges that Lockheed Martin unlawfully harassed, disciplined, and discriminated against Plaintiff and failed to reasonably accommodate him, on the basis of disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Count I) and the Rehabilitation Act (Count IV). Count II alleges that Lockheed Martin unlawfully harassed, disciplined, and discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of race, and subjected him to a [*11]  hostile work environment, by placing him in "out of work pending placement" status and by failing to put him back in his original position when he returned, in violation of Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981. In Count III, Plaintiff claims that Lockheed Martin violated Title VII and the ADA by unjustly harassing and disciplining him (again by placing him in "out of work pending placement" status and by failing to put him back in his original position when he returned) in retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in March 2008 ("EEOC charge"). Finally, in Count V, Plaintiff alleges that Lockheed Martin interfered with Plaintiff's FMLA rights and retaliated against Plaintiff in violation of the FMLA by requiring him to take more leave than he sought or was medically necessary, and by failing and refusing to return him to the same or similar position that he held prior to his leave, with equal pay.
Defendant's motion for summary judgment has been briefed by the parties and is ripe for review.

A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issues of material fact are present and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter [*12]  of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The movant carries its burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the nonmoving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991). The nonmovant is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, answers to interrogatories, depositions, admissions and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). "Mere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to create a dispute to defeat summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (citation omitted). Resolving all doubts in favor of the nonmoving party, the court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." Id. at 252.

B. Facts
As a preliminary matter, the court notes that the following facts are derived from Defendant's Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is no Genuine Issue to be Tried [Doc. 37-3](hereinafter "DSMF"), Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts Which Are in Dispute [Doc. 47]("PSMF"), [*13]  Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts Which Are in Dispute [Doc. 50-1]("DRPSMF"), as well as uncontroverted record evidence. The court further notes that a number of "facts" set out in Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts do not conform to this court's scheduling order and instructions. [See Doc. 16 at 3, Magistrate Judge's Scheduling Order and Instructions Regarding Summary Judgment Motions, issued to the parties on November 24, 2009 ("The court will not consider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (b) supported by a citation to a pleading rather than to evidence; [and] (c) stated as an issue or legal conclusion....")]. Accordingly, the court has considered only those facts in Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts which comply with the requirements of Local Rule 56.1(B)(2)(a).
In addition, Plaintiff filed no response of any sort to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts. Under Local Rule 56.1 of the Northern District of Georgia, a party moving for summary judgment must include "a separate, concise, numbered statement of the material facts to which the movant contends there is no genuine issue to be tried." L.R. 56.1(B)(1). The court deems the movant's [*14]  facts admitted unless the opposing party either refutes the facts with citations to evidence or law, or states a valid objection to the movant's evidence.2 This rule was also set out in the court's Scheduling Order. [See Doc. 16 ("The Court will deem as admitted those facts in the moving party's statement that the non-moving party has not directly refuted with a concise response supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number)")]. Because Plaintiff has neither refuted nor stated valid objections to the material facts as set forth in Defendant's Statement of Material Facts, these facts are deemed admitted by operation of law. LR 56.1(B)(2); Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1267-69 (11th Cir. 2008).
In light of the foregoing summary judgment [*15]  standard, the court finds the following facts for the purpose of resolving Defendant's motion for summary judgment only. Lockheed Martin designs, manufactures, and supports military aircraft. [DSMF ¶ 1]. Plaintiff was hired by Lockheed Martin in March 2003 to work at its Marietta, Georgia facility. [DSMF ¶ 3; PSMF ¶ 2]. In 2007, Plaintiff was working as a Flight Line/Test Electrician on Defendant's C-130 program. The flight line is where aircraft are taken (after production is complete) for testing before being delivered to the client. [DSMF ¶ 5].
As a Flight Line/Test Electrician, Plaintiff was responsible for inspecting, testing, troubleshooting, and reworking the functional electrical systems of the aircraft. A number of his duties included working near moving vehicles, including at times "live" aircraft, with the resulting potential for injury due to electric shock and movement of hydraulically activated components. [Pl.'s Dep. at 90-91; DSMF ¶¶ 6 & 7]. Plaintiff's job duties also required him to perform work at heights in order to access certain interior and exterior areas of the aircraft. To get into the aircraft, it was necessary to climb up five to six steps. [PSMF ¶ 21]. When [*16]  working on components such as wing flaps, ailerons, elevator, and rudder, Flight Line/Test Electricians perform their work on elevated stands or lifts. [DSMF ¶ 11]. Inside the body of the aircraft, electricians routinely stand on step stools or ladders to perform work on bundles of wires that are contained in a rack mounted to the ceiling of the aircraft. [DSMF ¶ 12; PSMF ¶ 20]. Flight line employees also help move aircraft from one part of the flight line to another. [DSMF ¶ 13].
Plaintiff had his first seizure at work on April 18, 2003. Plaintiff's doctors were unable to determine the cause of that seizure. However, Plaintiff believes that it was caused by coming in contact with a coating that was being sprayed on an F-22 aircraft at work. [DSMF ¶¶ 15-16]. The hospital records indicate that he had a second seizure that same day in the emergency room after being transported to the hospital. [Pl.'s Dep. at 27; Pl.'s Dep. Exs. 6-8]. During the seizures, Plaintiff lost consciousness, and afterwards, he did not remember the seizures. [Pl.'s Dep. at 27, 31, 35-39, 45, 56, 69-70, Exs. 10-11, 14]. After dismissal from the hospital, Plaintiff states that his seizure condition "was controlled [*17]  through medication, specifically Dilantin." [PSMF ¶ 7]. On September 2, 2003, Plaintiff received injuries to his head when he sustained a powerful electrical shock at work. Plaintiff alleges that his injuries in 2003 "caused a temporary impairment or condition of seizure like activity." [Compl. ¶ 7; Pl.'s Dep. at 46].
On March 4, 2004, Plaintiff had a seizure in the Lockheed Martin parking lot as he was leaving work. [PSMF ¶ 8; Pl.'s Dep. at 40-41 & Ex. 12]. He was taken to the emergency room at nearby Kennestone Hospital, prescribed Dilantin, and referred to a neurologist for follow-up. Lockheed Martin's Medical Department records, dated March 8, 2004, note the following restrictions: "#34, Emp[loyee] is not to work around hazardous machinery. #37, Emp[loyee] is not to work at heights unless adequately protected." [Pl.'s Dep. Exs. 12-13].
Plaintiff's next seizure at work occurred on June 18, 2007. Following the seizure, Plaintiff received treatment at the hospital. [Pl.'s Dep. at 53]. On August 7, 2007, Plaintiff experienced another seizure at work while helping guide an aircraft that was being towed into position. [DSMF ¶¶ 18-20]. The weather that day was extremely hot and humid. [Pl.'s Dep. at 56-57; [*18]  PSMF ¶ 9]. When fire department personnel arrived to render aid, they found him still in a postictal state.3 [Pl.'s Dep. at 56-58]. Plaintiff was subsequently transported to the hospital by ambulance, where he was treated for epilepsy, dehydration and seizure disorder. [DSMF ¶¶ 21-22; Pl.'s Dep. at 58-61; Exs. 21-22].
On August 31, 2007, Plaintiff was in the break room at work. Coworkers reported a brief episode where Plaintiff's eyes started to roll back in his head, he was non-responsive and appeared to be losing consciousness. [DSMF ¶ 23]. One of the coworkers called the fire department and reported to his supervisor that Plaintiff was having a seizure. [Pl.'s Dep. at 70]. Per Lockheed Martin's protocol, Plaintiff was transported by ambulance to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a possible seizure. [DSMF ¶¶ 24-25]. Plaintiff does not believe he had a seizure at work that day. [PSMF ¶¶ 10-11].
Nevertheless, the increased frequency and severity of Plaintiff's seizures during the summer of 2007 caused Plaintiff's managers to become concerned about his ability to safely perform his required duties as a Test Electrician on the flight line. [Newsome Decl. Ex. A]. In September [*19]  2007, Lockheed Martin's Medical Department placed Plaintiff on temporary restrictions (no working at heights, no working around hazardous machinery, and no driving of company vehicles) while it sought the input and advice of Plaintiff's treating neurologist, Dr. Robert Bashuk. [PSMF ¶¶ 12-13; DSMF ¶¶ 26-27]. To help Dr. Bashuk understand the duties that Plaintiff was required to perform, the Medical Department provided the physician with a copy of Plaintiff's job description. [DSMF ¶ 28]. In response, Dr. Bashuk wrote back that he agreed that Plaintiff "should not work with heavy equipment or work at unguarded heights." [DSMF ¶ 29; Ex. 30].
At Lockheed Martin, when an employee cannot perform his normal job duties due to restrictions, the matter is referred to the designated Employee Placement Coordinator ("EPC") for the employee's work area to try and identify another position in which the employee may be placed. [DSMF ¶ 30]. The EPC investigates possible placement opportunities, then provides a report on his findings to the company's Work Accommodation Committee ("WAC"). [DSMF ¶ 31]. The WAC is comprised of representatives from several different departments, including Human Resources, [*20]  Labor Relations, Medical Services, Environmental Safety & Health (which includes Workers' Compensation), Equal Opportunity Programs, and Productions Operations. The WAC is tasked with considering all work opportunities that may be available to the affected employee. [DSMF ¶ 32].
In Plaintiff's case, the matter was referred to Bob Fetter, who was the designated EPC for Plaintiff's work area. [DSMF ¶ 33]. Fetter conducted an investigation into possible placement opportunities for Plaintiff. As part of his investigation, Fetter discussed Plaintiff's specific job duties with Plaintiff. He also spoke with department management personnel, relied upon his observations of the job being performed, and reviewed the written job description and a workers' compensation analysis form that described the duties of the position. [DSMF ¶ 35]. Plaintiff's immediate supervisor, Henry Jenkins, was not consulted. [Doc. 47-3, Jenkins Aff. ¶ 11]. Fetter concluded that there were no accommodations available that would enable Plaintiff to continue working in the Flight Line/Test Electrician position. [DSMF ¶ 36].
At all relevant times, the WAC was chaired by Kristen Madison, lead representative for Lockheed Martin's [*21]  Equal Opportunity Program office. Madison is African-American. [DSMF ¶¶ 37-38]. The WAC determined that it needed more information from Dr. Bashuk regarding the nature, extent and probable duration of Plaintiff's medical restrictions. At the committee's request, Lockheed Martin's Medical Department extended an invitation to Plaintiff's physician to personally tour the flight line area so that he could more fully understand the requirements of Plaintiff's job before making his recommendations. [DSMF ¶¶ 40-41].
In the meantime, the WAC assigned Plaintiff to the company's Temporary Work Program ("TWP"), which is designed to provide productive work assignments within an employee's work restrictions (but not necessarily within his or her occupation or classification) so that the employee may continue working. [Fetter Decl. Ex. A]. Under the company's policy, an employee may remain in the TWP for a total of sixty days, with the possibility of one thirty-day extension in appropriate cases. [Madison Decl. ¶ 8].
Plaintiff performed temporary work in the TWP until the sixty-day period expired on or about November 5, 2007. [DSMF ¶¶ 42-43; Madison Decl. ¶ 10]. While assigned to the TWP (also known [*22]  as the "magic shop"), Plaintiff's duties at times included cleaning binders in a storage room in Building 27. [Compl. ¶ 15; Pl.'s Dep. at 220; Fetter Decl. ¶ 27]. Plaintiff testified that the room was isolated and dirty, and the air conditioning system made working conditions there uncomfortably cold. [Pl.'s Dep. at 220-24].
By the end of the sixty days, Dr. Bashuk had not yet toured the flight line, and the WAC determined that there was no work available that Plaintiff could perform in his job classification, with his current restrictions. [DSMF ¶ 44]. The WAC further determined that Plaintiff could safely perform only about thirty percent of the duties essential to his flight line position. [Madison Decl. ¶ 11]. Because there was not enough work that Plaintiff could safely perform in his flight line position, the duration of his medical restrictions had remained unchanged, and his time in the TWP had expired, the WAC placed Plaintiff on an unpaid medical leave of absence (also known as "out pending placement") effective November 13, 2007, and directed Mr. Fedder to complete his investigation into placement options for Plaintiff. [Id.; DSMF ¶ 45].
Kristen Madison was the person who [*23]  had final authority to put Plaintiff "out pending placement." [DSMF ¶ 46]. In making the decision to put Plaintiff on unpaid leave, Madison did not review any of Plaintiff's medical records, nor was she aware of any requests that Plaintiff may have made to the company for Family and Medical Leave. [Madison Decl. ¶¶ 47-48]. At the time she made the decision, Madison also was not aware that Plaintiff had either filed, or intended to file, a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. [Id. ¶ 49].
On December 6, 2007, Plaintiff's neurologist, Dr. Bashuk, visited Plaintiff's work area at Lockheed Martin and spoke with the department's manager concerning the specific duties that flight line/test electricians were required to perform in that environment. [DSMF ¶ 52]. During the tour, Dr. Bashuk informed Plaintiff's manager that Plaintiff could not perform the flight line/test electrician position with Plaintiff's restrictions. [DSMF ¶ 52]. After the visit, Dr. Mark S. Wood, with Lockheed Martin's Medical Department, in a letter dated December 8, 2007, wrote Dr. Bashuk to thank him for touring Plaintiff's work area on the flight line. The letter stated, "Our group here has had some concern about [*24]  the spinning propeller blades, unguarded elevations, and other flight line moving vehicles. We have felt that this work area presents a direct threat of imminent harm to this person. Please relate your input on this concern, from your point of view in the space below...." [Madison Decl. Ex. J]. In response, Dr. Bashuk wrote, "I agree that [Plaintiff] should not work on unguarded elevations, propeller blades and in a location that could cause harm to other workers if he were to have a seizure." [DSMF ¶ 53; Madison Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex. J]. After a seizure follow-up visit on December 18, 2007, Dr. Bashuk noted in his office records that Plaintiff "should not perform any hazardous duties. He should not be in a situation where if he had a seizure he would severely injure himself or a coworker. He should not operate heavy or dangerous equipment. He should not be off the ground more than a foot for an extended period of time without some type of harness or protection. He is able to perform sedentary activities" with no restrictions on walking, sitting, standing, reaching, grasping, pushing or pulling. [Pl.'s Dep. Ex. 38; DSMF ¶ 54; Pl.'s Dep. at 110].
After Plaintiff was placed on leave, Fetter [*25]  continued to look for positions that Plaintiff could perform. As part of his efforts, Fetter contacted all of the department managers within the C-130 Program to determine whether there were any open positions in Plaintiff's classification that could be performed with Plaintiff's limitations and restrictions, but there were none. [DSMF ¶¶ 55-56]. Fetter also contacted the EPCs assigned to core Production Operations, the F-22 Program and the C-5 Program to determine whether they had any positions available. They did not. [DSMF ¶ 57]. Fetter concluded that there were no available positions outside of Plaintiff's job classification for which he was qualified and that he could do with his limitations. [DSMF ¶ 58].
In March 2008, an Electrical and Electronics Mechanic position that was not on the flight line became available. The job involved working on a bench located on ground level, putting together bundles of wires, called harnesses, that were not live. [Pl.'s Dep. at 101-02, 111-12 &Ex. 34]. The company offered the position to Plaintiff. Plaintiff accepted the position and returned to work on March 29, 2008. The position pays less than the Flight Line/Test Electrician position. [Pl.'s [*26]  Dep. at 24]. Plaintiff has been continuously employed in the Electrical and Electronics Mechanic position since March 29, 2008 and remains in that position today. [DSMF ¶¶ 59-62].
Since Plaintiff returned to work, he has continued to have seizures, and his work restrictions remain unchanged — i.e., no work around hazardous machinery, no work at heights, no driving company vehicles. [Pl.'s Dep. Ex. 39; DSMF ¶ 63; Pl.'s Dep. at 111, 114-16, 123-24; Exs. 40-48].
On March 21, 2008, shortly before Plaintiff returned to work, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, alleging that Lockheed Martin had discriminated and retaliated against him on the basis of race and disability. [Pl.'s Dep. Ex. 55]. In his EEOC charge, Plaintiff alleged that on August 10, 2007, his employer placed him on medical restrictions due to a perceived disability and that his physician had not approved the restrictions. Plaintiff further alleged that when he complained, he was assigned to several different work areas but never allowed to return to his original position. On November 13, 2007, after Plaintiff complained again, he was removed from employment pending placement, while similarly situated employees [*27]  not of Plaintiff's race with recorded disabilities were allowed to remain working with the company. Id. Plaintiff closed by stating, "I believe that I was discriminated against due to a perceived disability in violation of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, and due to my race (African American) and in retaliation for opposing unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended." Id.
On March 30, 2008, nine days after he filed his charge with the EEOC, Plaintiff filed a voluntary petition to declare bankruptcy with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia. [DSMF ¶ 64]. In the petition's Statement of Financial Affairs, Plaintiff was asked to disclose "all suits and administrative proceedings to which the debtor is or was a party within one year immediately preceding the filing of this bankruptcy case." [Pl.'s Dep. Ex. 59 at 23 ¶ 4]. Plaintiff checked the box for "None" and signed the petition under penalty of perjury, swearing that "the information provided in this petition is true and correct." [DSMF ¶ 65; Pl.'s Dep. at 234-38]. Plaintiff did not amend his bankruptcy petition to disclose [*28]  the filing and pendency of his EEOC charge. [DSMF ¶ 67; Pl.'s Dep. at 239].
On August 27, 2008, approximately five months after he returned to work, Plaintiff had a seizure while driving his car, and suffered an intracranial hemorrhage in the accident. [Pl.'s Dep. at 114-16, 123-24, Exs. 40-43]. Plaintiff's treating physician later released him to return to work with no additional work restrictions beyond what Dr. Bashuk had recommended. [PSMF ¶ 44].
On February 20, 2009, the EEOC issued a notice of right to sue in connection with Plaintiff's charge. [Pl.'s Dep. Ex. 57]. Plaintiff filed this civil action on May 19, 2009. [Doc. 1, Complaint]. On July 30, 2009, Plaintiff had a seizure at home for which he was admitted and treated at Wellstar Cobb Hospital and discharged two days later. [Pl.'s Dep. at 123-24 &Exs. 47-48].

C. Discussion

1. Judicial Estoppel
Defendant first argues that Plaintiff's claims are barred by judicial estoppel because Plaintiff failed to disclose in his bankruptcy petition that he had recently filed (nine days earlier) an EEOC charge of discrimination.
The equitable doctrine of judicial estoppel precludes a party from "asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that is [*29]  inconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a previous proceeding." Barger v. City of Cartersville, 348 F.3d 1289, 1293 (11th Cir. 2003)(citation omitted). The doctrine bars a plaintiff from pursuing employment discrimination claims for damages that were not disclosed in a prior bankruptcy proceeding, where the plaintiff knew of the claims and had a motive to conceal them from the court. See De Leon v. Comcar Indus., Inc., 321 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir. 2003)(citing Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., 291 F.3d 1282, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 2002)); Barger, 348 F.3d at 1293-97.
"[T]he Bankruptcy Code and Rules impose upon bankruptcy debtors an express, affirmative duty to disclose all assets, including contingent and unliquidated claims," such as a cause of action. See In re Coastal Plains, Inc., 179 F.3d 197, 207-08 (5th Cir. 1999); see also 11 U.S.C. §§ 521(a)(1)(B)(i), 541(a)(1). In a Chapter 13 case, the duty to disclose applies to property (including causes of action) acquired both before and after a petition is filed. 11 U.S.C. § 1306(a)(1). "The debtor need not know all the facts or even the legal basis for the cause of action; rather, if the debtor has enough information ... to suggest that it may have a possible cause of action, then that is a 'known' cause of action such that it must be disclosed. Any claim with potential must be disclosed, even if it is contingent, dependent, or conditional." In re Coastal Plains, 179 F.3d at 208 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
"In the Eleventh Circuit, courts consider two factors in the application of judicial estoppel [*30]  to a particular case. First, it must be shown that the allegedly inconsistent positions were made under oath in a prior proceeding. Second, such inconsistencies must be shown to have been calculated to make a mockery of the judicial system." Burnes, 291 F.3d at 1285 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). "[T]hese two enumerated factors are not inflexible or exhaustive; rather, courts must always give due consideration to all of the circumstances of a particular case when considering the applicability of this doctrine." Id. at 1286. "[J]udicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine, and the decision whether to invoke it [is] within the court's discretion ...." In re Coastal Plains, 179 F.3d at 205.
Generally, a finding of bad faith is required before a court may exercise its inherent sanctioning powers such as judicial estoppel. See Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 767, 100 S. Ct. 2455, 65 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1980) (stating that a "specific finding" of bad faith "would have to precede any sanction under the court's inherent powers"); see also Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 50, 111 S. Ct. 2123, 115 L. Ed. 2d 27 (1991) ("A court must, of course, exercise caution in invoking its inherent power, and it must comply with the mandates of due process, both in determining that the requisite bad faith exists and in assessing fees.").
Although the Eleventh Circuit has not explicitly stated that bad faith is a requirement for application [*31]  of judicial estoppel, the language used by the Court to describe the doctrine implies as much. See Strauss v. Rent-A-Center, Inc., 192 F. App'x 821, 823 (11th Cir. 2006) (declining to apply judicial estoppel in part due to absence of finding that "the debtor intentionally misled the bankruptcy court as to the existence and then character of her employment lawsuit"); Burnes, 291 F.3d at 1288 (finding that the district court correctly concluded that Plaintiff "possessed the requisite intent to mislead the bankruptcy court and correctly barred him from pursuing his discrimination claims") (emphasis added). Other courts have explicitly stated that a finding of bad faith is required. See, e.g., Johnson v. Oregon Dep't of Human Res., 141 F.3d 1361, 1370 (9th Cir. 1998); Ryan Operations G.P. v. Santiam-Midwest Lumber Co., 81 F.3d 355, 362-65 (3rd Cir. 1996); see also In re Cassidy, 892 F.2d 637, 642 (7th Cir. 1990)(judicial estoppel should not be applied "where it would work an injustice, such as where the former position was the product of inadvertence or mistake").
It is undisputed that the Statement of Financial Affairs ("SFA") that Plaintiff filed in his bankruptcy case did not disclose his EEOC charge. Even though Plaintiff did not file a lawsuit before or during the pendency of his bankruptcy petition, the pending EEOC charge constitutes "administrative proceedings" and "[o]ther contingent and unliquidated claims" that Plaintiff was required to disclose on his SFA. All potential causes of [*32]  action that exist at the time the petitioner files for bankruptcy are the property of the bankruptcy estate. See 11 U.S.C. § 541(a); Barger, 348 F.3d at 1292; Casanova v. Pre Solutions, Inc., 228 F. App'x 837, 841 (11th Cir. 2007).
Nevertheless, the evidence in this case does not support a finding that Plaintiff acted in bad faith or that he intended to manipulate the court system to his advantage. Plaintiff denies any such intent, and the facts of this case do not imply otherwise. Thus, the present case is readily distinguishable from Burnes, the case relied on by Defendant, where the Eleventh Circuit found, inter alia, "sufficient evidence from which to infer intentional manipulation." 291 F.3d at 1287.
"Because of their very potency, inherent powers must be exercised with restraint and discretion.... [O]utright dismissal of a lawsuit ... is a particularly severe sanction ...." Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44-45. As explained by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, judicial estoppel should be invoked only when a miscarriage of justice or damage to the integrity of the judicial system would otherwise result:
[J]udicial estoppel is an "extraordinary remed[y] to be invoked when a party's inconsistent behavior will otherwise result in a miscarriage of justice." It is not meant to be a technical defense for litigants seeking to derail potentially meritorious claims, especially [*33]  when the alleged inconsistency is insignificant at best and there is no evidence of intent to manipulate or mislead the courts. Judicial estoppel is not a sword to be wielded by adversaries unless such tactics are necessary to "secure substantial equity."
Ryan Operations, 81 F.3d at 365 (internal citations omitted). Under the circumstances of this case, application of judicial estoppel would be unduly harsh and inequitable. I therefore RECOMMEND that Defendant's motion with respect to judicial estoppel be DENIED.

2. Failure to Satiny Statutory Prerequisites
Title VII, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act all require an individual alleging employment discrimination to first file a charge with the EEOC and to completely exhaust the administrative remedies available from the EEOC before filing suit in federal court. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1); Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir. 2001); 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a); Maxwell v. Inner Harbour, Ltd., No. 1:08-CV-2925-RWS, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33574, 2009 WL 1045478, at *1-2 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 20, 2009)(stating that the administrative filing requirements are the same for claims brought under Title VII and the ADA); Doe v. Garrett, 903 F.2d 1455, 1461 (11th Cir. 1990)(same with regard to claims brought pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act). As a general rule, a plaintiff may not bring any claim in his lawsuit that was not included in his EEOC charge. See Gregory v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., 355 F.3d 1277, 1279-80 (11th Cir. 2004)(citing Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970)("the 'scope' of the judicial complaint is [*34]  limited to the 'scope' of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination")). A plaintiff is precluded from pursuing any claims in a federal court action that are not "like or related" to the claims asserted by the plaintiff in his EEOC charge, or that could not reasonably be expected to arise during the course of the EEOC investigation. Id.; see also Coon v. Ga. Pac. Corp., 829 F.2d 1563, 1568-69 (11th Cir. 1987)(limiting plaintiff's action in court to the single claim contained in plaintiff's EEOC charge).
In this case, Plaintiff testified that the only claims he included in his EEOC charge were a "perceived as" ADA claim, a race discrimination claim, and a retaliation claim. [Pl.'s Dep. at 227; Ex. 55 (EEOC charge)]. As mentioned above, Plaintiff's 2008 EEOC charge alleges that on August 10, 2007, Lockheed Martin placed Plaintiff on medical restrictions due to a perceived disability and that his physician had not approved the restrictions. The charge further alleges that when Plaintiff complained, he was assigned to several different work areas but never allowed to return to his original position. Then on or about November 13, 2007, after Plaintiff complained again, Plaintiff alleges that he [*35]  was removed from employment pending placement, while similarly situated employees not of Plaintiff's race with recorded disabilities were allowed to remain working with the company. [Pl.'s Dep. Ex. 55]. Plaintiff summarized his claims by stating, "I believe that I was discriminated against due to a perceived disability in violation of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, and due to my race (African American) and in retaliation for opposing unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended." Id.
Defendant argues that because Plaintiff's 2008 EEOC charge fails to specifically mention or allege that Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of an actual or "record of" disability, that his employer failed to reasonably accommodate him, or that he was subjected to unlawful harassment or a hostile work environment on the basis of race and disability, those claims are barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In response, Plaintiff asserts that these claims are sufficiently like or related to the claims asserted in his EEOC charge that they should reasonably have been expected to arise out [*36]  of the charge that he filed.
I find that the disputed ADA and Title VII claims that Plaintiff raises before this court are arguably within the scope of those raised in his 2008 EEOC charge. Therefore, the court will consider them.
With regard to Plaintiff's claims pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act, Defendant contends that those claims also are barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Even if Plaintiff had included a claim under the Rehabilitation Act in his EEOC charge, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claims because Section 504 of the Act does not apply to Lockheed Martin. Defendant asserts that the Act prohibits disability discrimination "under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance...." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). "Federal financial assistance" means the federal government's provision of a subsidy to an entity, and Lockheed Martin states that it does not receive any subsidies. Shotz v. American Airlines, Inc., 420 F.3d 1332, 1335 (11th Cir. 2005); [Madison Decl. ¶ 2]. See also Rylee v. Chapman, No. 2:06-cv-0158-RWS, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61055, 2008 WL 3538559, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 11, 2008)(granting summary judgment to employer because plaintiff failed to show that employer received or was directly benefitted by federal financial assistance).
In Plaintiff's response to [*37]  Defendant's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff has not addressed Defendant's argument that the Rehabilitation Act does not apply. Consequently, this court concludes that Plaintiff has abandoned his claim or claims under the Rehabilitation Act. See Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir. 2001)(deeming claim abandoned where argument was not presented in initial response to motion for summary judgment); see also White v. Ga. Dep't of Motor Vehicle Safety, No. 1:06-CV-0124-TWT, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36497, 2006 WL 1466254, at *1 (N.D. Ga. May 19, 2006) ("[I]t is well-accepted in this district that the failure to respond to arguments relating to a claim constitutes abandonment of the claim.").
Based upon the foregoing, I RECOMMEND that summary judgment be GRANTED in favor of Lockheed Martin as to Plaintiff's Count IV claims under the Rehabilitation Act.

3. Plaintiff's Claims Under the ADA
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the ADA (1) by failing to place him in a job within his restrictions; (2) by placing him in the TWP for 60 days and then on unpaid medical leave (or out pending placement) for four months; and (3) upon his return to work, by placing him in a lower-paying job because of an alleged disability, all in violation of the ADA.4 Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's [*38]  ADA claims because Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case or show that Defendant's proffered reasons are pretextual.
Under the controlling law in this Circuit, "[t]he [McDonnell Douglas] burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims is applicable to ADA claims." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under this analysis, Plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of disability discrimination. See Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001). If Plaintiff puts forth a prima facie case, which establishes a presumption of discrimination, the burden then shifts to Lockheed Martin to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged employment action or actions. Id. Lockheed Martin simply has the burden of production, and does not need to persuade the court that it was motivated by the reason or reasons. Id. After the articulated reason or reasons are given, the inferential presumption of discrimination is eliminated, the McDonnell Douglas framework disappears, and Plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of proving that Lockheed Martin intentionally discriminated against him because of his disability. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). In order to prove this intentional discrimination, Plaintiff must show [*39]  that Lockheed Martin's reasons are "unworthy of credence" and a pretext for discrimination. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255-56.
The ADA provides that no covered employer shall discriminate against "a qualified individual on the basis of disability" in regard to any of the "terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff must show that: (1) he has a disability; (2) he was a "qualified individual" at the relevant time, meaning he could perform the essential functions of the job in question with or without reasonable accommodations; and (3) he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability. Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted); Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). The ADA defines "disability" as: (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A-C). Plaintiff has not established or satisfied any of the three "disability" prongs.5

a. Actual Disability
To qualify as disabled under the first part of the ADA's definition of disability, a plaintiff must initially prove that he or she has a physical or mental impairment. Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 194, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002).6 To the [*40]  extent Plaintiff argues that he indeed suffers from an actual disability, Plaintiff has presented evidence that he suffered injuries to his head in 2003, causing a "temporary impairment or condition of seizure like activity." [Oshodi Dep. at 46].
Merely showing that one has an impairment, however, is not enough. Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the impairment "substantially limits a major life activity." Toyota, 534 U.S. at 195; 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). "'Major' in the phrase 'major life activities' means important." Toyota, 534 U.S. at 197. The phrase "major life activities" therefore refers to "those activities that are of central importance to daily life." Id. Similarly, the word "substantial" in the phrase "substantially limits" "suggests 'considerable' or 'to a large degree,'" and thus, "clearly precludes impairments that interfere in only a minor way with the performance of manual tasks from qualifying as disabilities." Id. at 196-97.
Pre-ADAAA, the major life activities enumerated by the EEOC included "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and [*41]  working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i).7 Plaintiff testified that the two major life activities that he is limited in are the ability to operate heavy equipment and the ability to stand at unguarded heights. [Pl.'s Dep. at 136]. Neither activity has been found to constitute a "major life activity" for purposes of the ADA. See Dorsey v. Atlanta Cmty. Food Bank, No. 1:05-CV-3151-RWS, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17596, 2007 WL 788936, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 14, 2007)(stating that operating heavy machinery does not constitute a major life activity)(listing cases); Schuler v. SuperValu, Inc., 336 F.3d 702, 703, 706 (8th Cir. 2003)(holding that epileptic plaintiff could not demonstrate that his employer regarded him as substantially limited in a major life activity even though he was "medically restricted ... from working around unprotected dangerous equipment or unprotected heights.").
To the extent that Plaintiff argues that his seizure condition substantially limits the major life activity of work, a plaintiff alleging such a limitation must "show an inability to work in a 'broad range of jobs,' rather than a specific job." Toyota, 534 U.S. at 200 (citation omitted). "To be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, an individual must be precluded from more than one type of job, even if the job foreclosed is the individual's job of choice." Cash v. Smith, 231 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir. 2000). "If jobs utilizing an individual's [*42]  skills are available, that individual is not considered substantially limited in [his] ability to work." Id.
Here, Plaintiff has failed to show that his seizure condition prevented or precluded him from working in a broad range of jobs. At most, Plaintiff has presented evidence indicating that his seizures have occurred periodically since his diagnosis in 2003 and that they required only brief hospitalizations or evaluations. In addition, the evidence in the record shows that Plaintiff's seizure condition is controlled by medication and that, except for driving company vehicles, working with heavy equipment and working at heights, he can participate in work activities and activities of daily living without limitation or accommodation. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to show that he has an actual physical or mental impairment that satisfies the requirements of the ADA.

b. Record of Impairment
Plaintiff next argues that he is disabled for purposes of the ADA because he has a record of an impairment. "The intent of the 'record of' prong of the ADA, in part, 'is to ensure that people are not discriminated against because of a history of disability.'" Couts v. Beaulieu Group, LLC, 288 F. Supp. 2d 1292, 1305 (N.D. Ga. 2003)(citation omitted). A person has a record of [*43]  a disability if "'a record relied upon by an employer indicates that the individual has or had a substantially limiting impairment.'" Id. (quoting 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630 App. § 1630.2(k)).
Plaintiff has failed to show that he has a record of a disability, as defined in the ADA. First, Plaintiff has failed to show the existence of any record that indicates that Plaintiff has, or had, a substantially limiting impairment. Second, even if such a record exists, no evidence before the court even hints that Kristen Madison, who made the decision to place Plaintiff on unpaid medical leave, had seen or was familiar with Plaintiff's medical records (or any other records that might suggest that he was substantially limited in a major life activity), and no such records were brought to the WAC for its consideration. [Madison Decl. ¶ 19]. Under these circumstances, Plaintiff has failed to show that he has a record of an impairment, as defined by the ADA. Couts, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 1305 (citing Lawson v. CSX Transp., Inc., 245 F.3d 916, 927 n.10 (7th Cir. 2001)("Along with a showing that a record of a substantially limiting impairment exists, a plaintiff must also demonstrate that the employer knew of that record.")).

c. Regarded As Having Such an Impairment
Plaintiff also argues that Defendant regarded Plaintiff as disabled. [*44]  To prevail on a "perception" theory under the Act, Plaintiff must show that Lockheed Martin refused to allow him to return to his original position because it regarded him as having a physical impairment as that term is defined by the Act. Sutton v. Lader, 185 F.3d 1203, 1208 (11th Cir. 1999)(citing Gordon v. E.L. Hamm &Assocs., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 913 (11th Cir. 1996)).
To the extent Plaintiff claims that Defendant was aware that Plaintiff suffered from a seizure condition, such an awareness, without more, is not sufficient to show that Defendant regarded Plaintiff as disabled for purposes of the ADA. Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1230 (11th Cir. 1999). Instead, the "perceived impairment must be believed to substantially limit a major life activity of the individual." Id. Here, Plaintiff has presented no evidence that even suggests that Defendant believed that Plaintiff had an impairment that substantially limited any major life activities. Moreover, from the evidence, it is clear that Lockheed Martin perceived Plaintiff to have merely an incapacity to perform safely certain essential functions of his job as a Flight Line/Test Electrician. An employer's perception that an employee cannot perform a particular task safely does not establish that the employer regarded the employee as disabled. Sutton, 185 F.3d at 1209 (citing Chandler v. City of Dallas, 2 F.3d 1385, 1393 (5th Cir. 1993)).
Further, as the Supreme Court has explained, the essence [*45]  of a "regarded as disabled" claim is misperception:
There are two apparent ways in which individuals may fall within this statutory definition: (1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. In both cases, it is necessary that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the individual--it must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting.
Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999), superseded by statute, ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub.L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008).
Here, both Plaintiff and Defendant agree that Plaintiff has a seizure condition. Nonetheless, Plaintiff contends that he is capable of performing his original job duties in his Flight Line/Test Electrician position, and that Lockheed Martin's Medical Department placed him on more restrictive limitations than what his personal physicians recommended (for example, no working at heights versus no working at unguarded heights). Plaintiff, however, has [*46]  failed to show that any misperceptions existed on Defendant's part with respect to Plaintiff's condition. Moreover, to date, Plaintiff's physicians have never released Plaintiff to return to his Flight Line/Test Electrician position. Instead, Lockheed Martin made available to Plaintiff — and Plaintiff accepted — an alternative position for which he was qualified and that he could safely perform with his limitations. Under these circumstances, Plaintiff cannot contend that Defendant regarded Plaintiff as disabled for purposes of the ADA. McCollough v. Atlanta Beverage Co., 929 F. Supp. 1489, 1498 (N.D. Ga. 1996) (noting defendant did not regard plaintiff as disabled for purposes of ADA simply because defendant discontinued plaintiff's gifting duties as a result of representations made by plaintiff and plaintiff's physician); see also Hilburn, 181 F.3d at 1230 (concluding defendant did not regard plaintiff as disabled for purposes of ADA where defendant's recognition of plaintiff's limitations was recognition of fact, rather than erroneous perception); Bute v. Schuller Int'l, Inc., 998 F. Supp. 1473, 1477 (N.D. Ga. 1998)(the fact that employer considered employee to be unable to perform duties of machine attendant did not establish that employer regarded employee as disabled). Because a job utilizing Plaintiff's skills became available and was offered [*47]  to him by Defendant, it is clear that Defendant did not regard him as having a disability within the meaning of the ADA. See Cash, 231 F.3d at 1307 ("Not only were jobs utilizing [the plaintiff's] skills available, but [the defendant] was in fact employing [the plaintiff] in such a job at the time of the actions complained of, and it continued to do so.").

d. Qualified Individual
Plaintiff has also failed to show that he meets the ADA's definition of a "qualified individual." Under the ADA, a "qualified individual" is one who "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation. Thus, if Plaintiff is unable to perform an essential function of his Flight Line/Test Electrician job, even with an accommodation, he is — by definition — not a "qualified individual" under the ADA. See Davis v. Fla. Power &Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000)("[T]he employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential and the employer's written description for that job" shall [*48]  be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job).
At Lockheed Martin, Flight Line/Test Electricians are responsible for performing the electrical work necessary to bring the C-130s from non-functioning "dead" planes to "live," functioning military transport aircraft. [McGagin Decl. ¶ 4]. As an electrician on the C-130 flight line, the essential functions of Plaintiff's job included reworking, inspecting, testing, troubleshooting, making design changes, and servicing the complete electrical systems and related accessories of the aircraft on the flight line. [Pl.'s Dep. at 23 & Ex. 5; Fetter Decl. Ex. C, job description]. The position required Plaintiff to work with and around heavy equipment and machinery, including moving vehicles and live aircraft. Other required functions included exposure to excessive noise; exposure to extreme temperatures and humidity; exposure to gas, fumes and chemicals; and working at guarded heights. [Fetter Decl. Ex. G].
According to the senior manager of the C-130 flight line, Kevin McGagin, many of the job's essential functions involve hazardous duties, and "virtually all such duties would be hazardous for an individual who has seizures" or who [*49]  is at risk for losing situational awareness. [McGagin Decl. ¶ 5]. For instance, electricians on the flight line conduct high amperage relays to verify that the aircraft's power voltage levels are accurate, and improper or accidental contact with the wires can be fatal. The job also involves testing and verifying the proper functioning of numerous moving parts, including the hydraulically-operated components of the aircraft that enable it to fly, such as wing flaps, ailerons, the rudder, and loading ramps and doors. This involves working at significant heights (12-15 feet) on step stools, ladders and elevated stands from which a fall could cause serious injury, as well as working around spinning propeller blades and numerous moving vehicles and other aircraft on the busy flight line. [McGagin Decl. ¶¶ 8-9]. Even with a safety harness, safety belt, or other protective gear, an unconscious employee is at high risk for serious injury to himself and others, or even death by electrocution, if he falls or comes into accidental contact with the aircraft's electrical system, numerous moving parts or other hazards in his immediate vicinity. As a result, Flight Line/Test Electricians must be [*50]  highly aware of their surroundings at all times in order to prevent serious harm both to themselves and to other flight line employees. [McGagin Decl. ¶ 6].
In support of Plaintiff's claim that he is eligible and able to perform the essential functions of his Flight Line/Test Electrician position, Plaintiff has produced an affidavit from his direct supervisor, Henry Jenkins, stating that "At all relevant times I had work that Mr. Oshodi was able to perform give[n] his medical restrictions." [Doc. 47-3 at 1, Jenkins Aff.]. However, there is no indication that Mr. Jenkins had medical training or that he was otherwise competent to render such an opinion. Nor was Jenkins authorized to make (or responsible for making) job placement decisions or determinations on behalf of Lockheed Martin for workers with medical restrictions. Moreover, the fact that Plaintiff's supervisor had some work that Plaintiff could do within his restrictions does not rebut Lockheed Martin's contention that Plaintiff could safely perform only about 30 percent of the duties essential to his flight line position. [Madison Decl. ¶ 11].
In addition, Plaintiff insists that the only job function his neurologist, Dr. Bashuk, restricted [*51]  him from doing was working at unguarded heights (and his job description did not require that). However, the record indicates that Plaintiff's medical restrictions also prohibited him from working around hazardous machinery, as Dr. Bashuk personally confirmed to Plaintiff's manager, McGagin, during their tour of Plaintiff's work area. [McGagin Decl. ¶ 20 ("During the tour, Dr. Bashuk informed me in no uncertain terms that Mr. Oshodi could not work in this work area with his restrictions."); Ex. C].
Because Plaintiff has not shown that he is able to perform the essential functions of his Flight Line/Test Electrician job, even with an accommodation, he is — by definition — not a "qualified individual," and, therefore, not covered under the ADA. Davis, 205 F.3d at 1305. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the second prong of his prima facie case of disability discrimination.

e. No showing of pretext
Even if Plaintiff had established a prima facie case of disparate treatment disability discrimination, his claim would still fail because Lockheed Martin has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its decisions: specifically, (1) that Plaintiff was placed on a medical leave of absence and not returned [*52]  to the Flight Line/Test Electrician position because he was unable to perform the essential functions of the job with his restrictions; and (2) Plaintiff was not given another position at the same pay rate because no such position was available for which Plaintiff was qualified, that he could do with his restrictions, and for which he had rights under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Lockheed Martin has submitted several declarations from Plaintiff's management which testify to the bases for those decisions. This evidence satisfies Lockheed Martin's burden of production. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255.
The burden then shifts back to Plaintiff to raise a genuine factual question as to whether his employer's proffered reasons are false and a mere pretext for disability discrimination. Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Publ'g Co., 9 F.3d 913, 921 (11th Cir. 1993). Plaintiff may show pretext "either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256.
To show pretext, Plaintiff argues that Lockheed Martin's decisions could not have been based solely on Plaintiff's medical restrictions because the only restriction placed on him by his physician [*53]  was that he not work at unguarded heights, and his Flight Line/Test Electrician position did not require him to work at unguarded heights. In addition, Plaintiff's direct supervisor told him that he had work that Plaintiff could do within his restrictions. [Doc. 47-2, Pl.'s Resp. Br., at 23]. Also, despite its denial, Lockheed Martin clearly had knowledge of Plaintiff's seizure condition.
Apart from Jenkins' affidavit, however, Plaintiff's only other "proof" of pretext lies in his deposition, in which he claims that he was able to perform his job duties, even with his restrictions. These submissions do not meet Plaintiff's burden of showing the defendant's reasons to be pretextual. Plaintiff's entire case against Lockheed Martin consists of repeated, yet unsupported allegations of discrimination. "'[C]onclusory allegations of discrimination, without more, are not sufficient to raise an inference of pretext of intentional discrimination where [an employer] has offered . . . extensive evidence of legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions.'" Coutu v. Martin County Bd. of County Comm'rs, 47 F.3d 1068, 1073-74 (11th Cir. 1995)(citations omitted).
The court concludes, therefore, even giving every reasonable inference to the Plaintiff, that he has failed to demonstrate a [*54]  triable issue of disability discrimination under the ADA. For this reason and the reasons stated above, Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination under the ADA should be GRANTED.

f. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff has also failed to show that Lockheed Martin is liable for failure to accommodate.8 An employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer fails to provide "reasonable accommodations" for the disability--unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a); Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255. "The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job's essential functions." Id. at 1255-56 (citing Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997)).
A reasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to, such ameliorations as: (1) job restructuring; (2) part-time or modified work schedules; or even (3) reassignment to a vacant position. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). An employee is not entitled to his or her preferred accommodation, however -- only one that is reasonable. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86. Furthermore, "where a plaintiff [*55]  cannot demonstrate 'reasonable accommodation,' the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997). Before an employer has a duty to show undue hardship, the plaintiff first must show that a reasonable accommodation exists. See id. at 286.
Plaintiff contends that Lockheed Martin should have found a way to keep him in his Flight Line/Test Electrician position because his supervisor told him he needed him and could use him there. [Pl.'s Dep. at 175]. However, such accommodation would not have been reasonable, as Plaintiff could only perform about thirty percent of the essential functions of that position. [Madison Decl. ¶ 25]. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260 (stating that "employers are not required to transform the position into another one by eliminating functions that are essential to the nature of the job as it exists.").
Plaintiff also contends that Lockheed Martin should have moved him into a job in the "tool crib." [Pl.'s Dep. at 176]. Lockheed Martin, however, has produced evidence indicating that there was no budget for an additional position there, nor did Plaintiff have rights to such a position under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. [McGagin Decl. ¶ 16; Fetter Decl. [*56]  ¶ 17]. The ADA "does not require the employer to bump another employee from a position in order to accommodate a disabled employee." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1256. Moreover, "[a]n employer is not required to grant an employee a transfer to a different position if such a transfer violates a collective bargaining agreement because such an accommodation is not reasonable." Woodruff v. School Bd. of Seminole County, Fla., 304 F. App'x 795, 800 (11th Cir. 2008)(citation omitted).
In Plaintiff's case, Lockheed Martin went to great lengths to accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions. The EPC conducted a wide-ranging investigation into placement opportunities; the company found alternative work for Plaintiff to do for sixty days in the TWP; and the WAC met three times in an attempt to find another position that Plaintiff could safely perform. [Fetter Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6-10, 13-21, 24; Madison Decl. ¶¶ 5-9, 11-14; McGagin Decl. ¶¶ 14-17, 20-21, 25]. To ensure that Plaintiff's work restrictions were accurate and appropriate, Lockheed Martin requested input from Plaintiff's neurologist and even provided a personal tour of Plaintiff's work area. [Pl.'s Dep. at 105; Madison Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12; McGagin Decl. ¶ 20]. As soon as an appropriate position became available, Lockheed Martin notified Plaintiff and arranged to place him [*57]  there. Plaintiff remains employed in that position to this day. [Pl.'s Dep. at 24-25; Fetter Decl. ¶ 24; Newsome Decl. ¶ 16]. While Plaintiff may have preferred a different accommodation, an employee with a disability is "not entitled to the accommodation of [his] choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation." Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86 (citation omitted). The record clearly shows that Lockheed Martin met its burden to accommodate Plaintiff's limitations.
For the stated reasons, I recommend that Lockheed Martin be GRANTED summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim.

4. Racial Discrimination Claims under Title VII and § 1981
Plaintiff alleges that Lockheed Martin also unlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of race, in violation of Title VII and Section 1981,9 by treating Plaintiff differently than white employees with restrictions, by placing him on unpaid medical leave, and by failing to return him to his original or a comparable position. [Compl. ¶ 62; Pl.'s Dep. at 187]. To establish a prima facie case, Plaintiff must establish that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (4) he was treated differently than a similarly situated [*58]  employee outside his protected class. See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir. 2004).
Plaintiff contends that Lockheed Martin treated him differently than it treated white employees with restrictions because it "loaned" white employees with restrictions to other departments to keep them working, while it put Plaintiff out pending placement. [Pl.'s Dep. at 188]. To make a comparison of the plaintiff's treatment to that of non-minority employees, the plaintiff must show that he and the employees are similarly situated in all relevant respects. Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997).
Here, Plaintiff has failed to identify any similarly situated comparator who had medical restrictions due to a seizure disorder and who was "loaned" to another department rather than placed on medical leave. [See, e.g., Pl.'s Dep. at 149, discussing coworker Corey's fractured arm; Newsome Decl. ¶ 28]. With regard to Plaintiff's placement on unpaid leave, Plaintiff offers no probative evidence — and there is no evidence in the record — showing that Plaintiff was similarly situated to any non-African-American comparator who was treated more favorably than he. See Abel v. Dubberly, 210 F.3d 1334, 1339 (11th Cir. 2000) (stating that absent some other similarly situated but differently treated worker, there can [*59]  be no disparate treatment). Plaintiff has also failed to controvert Lockheed Martin's evidence that at the time Plaintiff was placed out on leave, there were no available positions into which Plaintiff could have been "loaned." [Fetter Decl. ¶ 18]. Indeed, apart from Plaintiff's allegations of disparate treatment with regard to medical restrictions, the only "similarly situated" comparators offered by Plaintiff as employees who were permitted to work in the "magic shop" for extended periods rather than placed out on leave were African Americans, the same race as Plaintiff. [Pl.'s Dep. at 190-94]; Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1563-64 (finding no prima facie case of race discrimination under Title VII where plaintiff failed to point to a non-minority employee who was treated more favorably than plaintiff). Plaintiff's unsupported and conclusory allegations that Lockheed Martin discriminated against him because of his race do not constitute evidence that Lockheed Martin's actions were racially motivated. Evers v. General Motors Corp., 770 F.2d 984, 986 (11th Cir. 1985) (stating that conclusory allegations without specific supporting facts have no probative value).
Nor has Plaintiff even attempted to show that the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons proffered by Lockheed Martin for its [*60]  employment actions were pretextual. Plaintiff has also failed to address the fact that the decisionmaker who placed Plaintiff on unpaid medical leave, Kristen Madison, is African American, like Plaintiff. [Madison Decl. ¶ 3]. "When the decision-maker is in the same class as the plaintiff, it is very difficult to show a discriminatory motive." Robinson v. UPS, Inc., No. 1:06-CV-2601-RLV, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84497, 2007 WL 3484743, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 14, 2007). Other than speculation, Plaintiff has shown nothing that would reasonably overcome this particular difficulty. See id.; [Pl.'s Dep. at 195-96].
For the stated reasons, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's Title VII and Section 1981 race discrimination claims.10

5. Retaliation claims under Title VII and the ADA
Plaintiff's retaliation claims also fail. To prevail on a claim of retaliation under Title VII or the ADA, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he engaged in conduct protected by the statute; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action at the time or after the protected conduct took place; and (3) there is a causal connection between the two. See Bigge v. Albertsons, Inc., 894 F.2d 1497, 1501 (11th Cir. 1990)(Title VII); Collado v. UPS, 419 F.3d 1143, 1158 (11th Cir. 2005)(ADA).
Here, it is undisputed that at the time Plaintiff was placed on unpaid medical leave in November 2007, the decisionmaker, Madison, had no knowledge that Plaintiff [*61]  had filed or intended to file an EEOC charge — and indeed, she could not have known because Plaintiff did not file his charge until four months later, in March 2008. See Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000)("A decision maker cannot have been motivated to retaliate by something unknown to him."). Plaintiff cannot establish a causal connection when the adverse employment activity precedes his protected activity. King v. Kennesaw State Univ., No. 1:05-CV-3169-TWT, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68195, 2007 WL 2713252, at *17 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 13, 2007). Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's Count III retaliation claims.

6. Hostile Work Environment Claims
Among other allegations, Paragraphs 46, 55, 63, and 71 of Plaintiff's Complaint assert that Plaintiff was subjected to harassment and a hostile work environment on the basis of disability and race. Lockheed Martin maintains that Plaintiff has failed to establish a hostile work environment claim. To establish a prima facie case, Plaintiff must show that (1) he belongs to a protected group; (2) he has been subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on a protected characteristic of the employee; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily [*62]  abusive working environment; and (5) the employer is responsible for such environment under either a theory of vicarious or of direct liability. McCann v. Tillman, 526 F.3d 1370, 1378 (11th Cir. 2008).
Plaintiff must show that he was subjected to a workplace that was "permeated with 'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.'" Harris v. Forklift Sys., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)(quoting Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986)). The discriminatory atmosphere must be "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [his] employment and create an abusive working environment." Id. (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67).
The "severe and pervasive" element contains both an objective and a subjective component. To be actionable, the challenged conduct must create an environment that is both objectively hostile or abusive (the reasonable person standard) and an environment that the plaintiff himself perceives to be abusive (the subjective standard). Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., 277 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2002). The court looks to all the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance. Harris, 510 U.S. at 21-22; Miller, 277 F.3d at 1276.
Plaintiff's hostile work environment claims are without merit. As an initial matter, Plaintiff has not identified any harassment [*63]  that was based on his alleged disability, much less provided evidence of harassing acts so severe or pervasive that they altered the terms and conditions of Plaintiff's employment. Nor has Plaintiff established that he belonged to a protected group on the basis of disability.
With regard to harassment based on race, Plaintiff alleges that coworkers have called him names like "uppity nagger" [sic] and made other negative comments like, "Lockheed waste money working with these cons." [Compl. ¶ 13]. In addition, Plaintiff contends that in 2003, he was forced to work around hazardous chemicals without proper protection and subjected to malicious pranks by coworkers. [Id. ¶¶ 13-14]. Plaintiff testified that unnamed white individuals called him a monkey and laughed behind his back because he was black. [Pl.'s Dep. at 210-13, 218-19]. He was also offended by a poster of President Obama that someone placed in Plaintiff's general work area. [Id. at 281]. In addition, Plaintiff complains that Lockheed Martin retaliated against him for filing his EEOC claim by assigning him to work in a cold, uninhabited room with old folders, rusty cabinets and junk. Plaintiff asserts that the company also failed to provide [*64]  him access to certain blueprints and instructions that he felt he needed to properly complete certain tasks that he was working on. [Id. at 167].
Based on Plaintiff's allegations and testimony, these incidents lack both the severity and pervasiveness that have been found to constitute a hostile work environment. The isolated comments that Plaintiff reports -- as offensive as they may have been to Plaintiff -- are no more than "a mere utterance that engendered negative feelings," and do not rise to the level of a hostile work environment. See Harris, 510 U.S. at 21-22 ("As we pointed out in Meritor, mere utterance of an ... epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII"); see also Edwards v. Wallace Cmty. Coll., 49 F.3d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir. 1995) (noting that "racial slurs allegedly spoken by co-workers had to be so 'commonplace, overt and denigrating that they created an atmosphere charged with racial hostility'"). Plaintiff's complaints about working in a "cold, uninhabited room" arose before, not after, Plaintiff filed his EEOC charge. Therefore, Plaintiff's reliance on his temporary assignment to Building 27 after he filed his charge is unavailing.11 Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence [*65]  that Lockheed Martin harassed him or subjected him to a hostile work environment on the basis of race or disability.
Plaintiff has also failed to show that Lockheed Martin "knew or should have known of the harassing conduct but failed to take prompt remedial action." Miller, 277 F.3d at 1278. Plaintiff has neither cited nor presented any evidence that Lockheed Martin knew or should have known of the racial comments or any other harassing conduct that Plaintiff alleges. [Cf. Larsgaard Decl. ¶¶ 18-20; Newsome Decl. ¶ ¶ 21, 24]. For this reason and the reasons stated above, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's hostile work environment claims.

7. Plaintiff's FMLA claims
Plaintiff's claims under the FMLA also fail. The FMLA creates two types of claims: (1) interference claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act, see 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1); and (2) retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act, see 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2); 29 U.S.C. 825.220(c). Strickland v. Water Works and Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001). When evaluating claims of retaliation under the FMLA, absent direct evidence of discrimination, courts apply the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting [*66]  framework for evaluating Title VII discrimination claims. Id. at 1207.
Plaintiff has alleged both types of claims: (1) that Lockheed Martin interfered with his right to take protected leave under the FMLA by requiring him to take more leave than he sought or than was medically necessary, and (2) that Lockheed Martin failed and refused to return him to his original position or a comparable position with equal pay in retaliation for taking FMLA leave.

a. Interference Claim
To prove FMLA interference, an employee must demonstrate that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled under the FMLA. Martin v. Brevard County Pub. Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1266-67 (11th Cir. 2008)(citing 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1); Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1206-07). An employee need not "allege that his employer intended to deny the right; the employer's motives are irrelevant." Id. (quoting Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208).
Plaintiff complains that Lockheed Martin required him to use FMLA leave while he was out pending placement. [Pl.'s Dep. at 177-78, 183-86]. However, Lockheed Martin's standard policy is that employees must use FMLA leave while on medical leaves for qualifying events, and the policy applies to all employees. [Larsgaard Decl. ¶ 17]. In addition, the FMLA statute expressly provides that "[t]he employer is responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as FMLA-qualifying." [*67]  29 C.F.R. § 825.300. Moreover, "[a]n employer may ... construe as FMLA leave any leave that an employee is taking as a result of a qualifying event, without express notice to the employee." Johnson v. Morehouse Coll., Inc., 199 F. Supp. 2d 1345, 1356 (N.D. Ga. 2002)(citing McGregor v. Autozone, 180 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir. 1999)). Plaintiff has not shown (nor has he cited any legal authority showing) that Lockheed Martin violated the FMLA when it designated Plaintiff's out-pending-placement leave as FMLA leave.
Plaintiff also complains that he was not restored to his Flight Line/Test Electrician (or equal) position. Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee is entitled to be restored to the same position held prior to the beginning of the leave, or its equivalent, in terms of benefits, pay and other terms and conditions. 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(1). "However, an employee is not entitled to restoration if, at the end of the FMLA leave period, the employee is still unable to perform an essential function of the job." Bloom v. Metro Heart Group of St. Louis, Inc., 440 F.3d 1025, 1029 (8th Cir. 2006) (citations omitted).
Although Plaintiff has continually maintained that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job, the record refutes this. When Plaintiff's condition did not change during his unpaid leave, Lockheed Martin was not required to reinstate him. "As long as an employer can show a lawful reason, i.e., a reason unrelated to an [*68]  employee's exercise of FMLA rights, for not restoring an employee on FMLA leave to [his] position, the employer will be justified to interfere with an employee's FMLA leave rights." Id. (citation omitted); Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208 ("if an employer can show that it refused to reinstate the employee for a reason wholly unrelated to the FMLA leave, the employer is not liable."). See also Colburn v. Parker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Div., 355 F. Supp. 2d 566, 574 (D. Me. 2005)(holding that "If the employee is unable to perform an essential function of the position which he held at the time he took FMLA leave because of a physical condition, including the continuation of a serious health condition, he has no right to restoration to another position under the FMLA upon expiration of the period of leave to which he is entitled."). Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled under the FMLA. Accordingly, as to Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim, Lockheed Martin's motion for summary judgment is due to be GRANTED.

b. Retaliation Claim
In order to establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he availed himself of a protected right under the FMLA; (2) he suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) the decision was causally [*69]  related to the protected activity. Parris v. Miami Herald Publ'g Co., 216 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir. 2000). Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the third element.
Plaintiff contends that Defendant's decision not to return him to his Flight Line/ Test Electrician position (or to a position of equal pay) was motivated by an intent to retaliate against him for taking intermittent FMLA leave while he was in the TWP. [Pl.'s Dep. at 179-86]. Plaintiff's chief evidence of causation is that Lockheed Martin required him to provide additional paperwork in support of his FMLA requests. [Doc. 47-2 at 28; Pl.'s Dep. 182-83; Larsgaard Decl. ¶¶ 15-16, Ex. B]. It is uncontroverted, however, that Plaintiff was asked to provide additional paperwork in support of his FMLA requests because the initial information that he provided was incomplete. Whenever an employee's paperwork does not contain sufficient information for Lockheed Martin to determine whether the employee is eligible for FMLA leave, the Medical Department requests that the missing information be provided. That clearly is what occurred here. [Larsgaard Decl. ¶ 15].
In any event, Plaintiff cannot show causation because the decisionmaker who put Plaintiff out on unpaid leave in November 2007 was [*70]  not aware that Plaintiff had requested intermittent FMLA leave. [Madison Decl. ¶¶ 17-18; Pl.'s Dep. at 178-87]. See Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 2010 WL 1267238, at *4 (11th Cir. 2010)(stating that plaintiff must show decisionmaker was aware of FMLA leave request). Even if Plaintiff had shown a causal relationship, he has not shown that Lockheed Martin's articulated reasons for the challenged employment decisions were pretextual. Accordingly, Lockheed Martin is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA interference and retaliation claims.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated, Plaintiff's motion for sanctions [Doc. 57] is DENIED. I RECOMMEND that Defendant Lockheed Martin's motion for summary judgment [Doc. 37] be GRANTED as to all of Plaintiff's claims.
IT IS SO ORDERED AND RECOMMENDED, this 6th day of January, 2011.
