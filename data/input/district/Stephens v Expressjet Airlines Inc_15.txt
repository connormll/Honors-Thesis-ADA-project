Opinion



ORDER
Pending before the Court are Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, (Instrument No. 49), and Plaintiff's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment. (Instrument No. 52).

I.

A.
ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. ("Defendant") is an air carrier that hired Iraina Stephens ("Plaintiff") as a flight attendant in 1999. (Instrument No. 49 at 8). The type of aircraft Plaintiff flies as part of her employment requires a three-person crew: the pilot, co-pilot, and a flight attendant. Id. Plaintiff is the sole flight attendant on each of her trips. Id. Defendant considers the position of a flight attendant a "safety-sensitive" one. Id. Defendant tasks flight attendants with passenger safety, including responding to any type of emergency situation and treating medical conditions in-flight.  [*2] Id. Defendant further requires that its flight attendants have the ability to withstand work environments that include, but are not limited to, a rotating schedule with variable hours that include up to 16-hour duty days, holidays, and weekends, confined spaces, and frequent and continuous contact with others. Id. Defendant asserts that this availability is necessary because of the complicated scheduling systems in the airline industry, such as customer demand, seasonal travel, aircraft maintenance, aircraft repositioning (i.e., getting a new plane or crew to a specific location for an assignment), and weather. (Instrument No. 50-1 at 5).
Defendant is covered by the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. § 151 et seq. (Instrument No. 49 at 8). Defendant's flight attendants are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers ("Union"). Id. at 8. Accordingly, Plaintiff's employment is governed by the Union's Collective Bargaining Agreement ("Collective Bargaining Agreement"), which contains agreements relating to, among other things: Job Qualifications; Seniority-Based Scheduling; Pay; Leaves of Absences, including Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"); Fitness for Duty Medical Examinations; Discipline; [*3]  and Dispute Resolution. Id. at 8.
The Collective Bargaining Agreement requires that flight attendants "be available for a full schedule." (Instrument No. 50-2 at 107). While the Collective Bargaining Agreement does not fully define a "full schedule," it provides that trips may be scheduled for six consecutive days of travel. Id. at 111. Defendant assigns flight attendants' schedules through seniority-based bidding. (See Instrument No. 50-2 at 61, 111-19). Pursuant to Section 4 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Defendant creates a "line," which are the trip schedules available to flight attendants to bid on each month. Id. at 111. Defendant governs bids by seniority and does not customize a line or trip schedule for any flight attendant. (Instrument No. 50-5 at 9-10). Defendant does not control what trips an active flight attendant bids on, and it does not mandate that a flight attendant only bid on certain lines. (Instruments No. 50-1 at 5-6; No. 50-2 at 66). To fulfill their obligation under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, flight attendants must be available to fly a full schedule without medical restrictions on their hours or number of days of travel. (Instrument No. 49 at 9).

1.
Beginning in 2005, Plaintiff [*4]  began seeing a psychiatrist for her mental health issues. (Instrument No. 53 at 7). Plaintiff suffers from Bipolar Disorder Type II; Attention Deficit Disorder ("ADHD"), inattentive type; anxiety; and depression. Id.; (Instrument No. 51-1 at 8). Plaintiff's conditions are chronic. (Instrument No. 53 at 8). Plaintiff takes medications to treat her anxiety and ADHD issues and notified Defendant of her medications from 2012 until 2015. Id. Plaintiff admits that she is afraid of flying and often believes that something will happen to the plane. (Instrument No. 50-2 at 30). She never shared her fears with her supervisors. Id. at 31.
In 2012, Plaintiff's psychiatrist assigned Plaintiff to psychiatric nurse practitioner Angela Alesi ("Alesi") to continue Plaintiff's treatment.1 Alesi testified that Plaintiff has anxiety, not necessarily specific to flying, but rather based on a fear of leaving her home and being around people. (Instruments No. 49 at 10; No. 51-1 at 23-24). Alesi further testified that Plaintiff's anxiety manifests itself as a very paralyzing feeling, a nervousness that shuts Plaintiff down and leads her to experience irrational fears. (Instrument No. 51-1 at 23-24). Alesi testified [*5]  that Plaintiff's anxiety episodes are sudden onset and could occur at any moment in time. Id. at 29-30.
Alesi personally filled out Plaintiff's applications for leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") from 2013 to 2015. (See Instrument No. 51-1 at 89-106). Alesi testified that in her opinion Plaintiff would not be able to perform her job as a flight attendant if she were to have a panic attack in flight. Id. at 29. Specifically, Alesi opined that Plaintiff's anxiety attacks could jeopardize passenger safety because Plaintiff's anxiety paralyzes her and makes her unable to think rationally. Id. In 2013, Alesi certified that Plaintiff would be unable to perform any of her flight attendant responsibilities 2-3 times per month, with each episodic occurrence potentially lasting 1-4 days. (Instrument No. 51-1 at 89-94). In 2014 and 2015, Alesi intended to certify Plaintiff again for one to four days per month, but was confused by the change in Defendant's forms and instead indicated that Plaintiff might be unable to travel or perform her flight duties 12-16 times per month. Id. at 36-37, 95-106.

2.
Defendant requires its flight attendants to report on time for a scheduled trip. (Instrument No. 49 at 11). Defendant [*6]  treats any failure to report on time for a scheduled trip as an "instance" that can result in a flight attendant's termination. Id/, (Instrument No. 50-2 at 92). Approved FMLA is not counted as an instance. (Instrument No. 50-2 at 90). Moreover, Defendant requires its flight attendants to provide it with two hours' advance notice of any absence. (Instrument No. 50-2 at 90). The failure to provide two hours' advance notice results in a "Missed Trip," an automatic step of discipline. Id. at 92. Three Missed Trips in a rolling twelve-month period will result in termination. Id.
Plaintiff submitted a request for intermittent FMLA leave twice in 2014, on February 7, 2014 for the period of February 26, 2014 through August 26, 2014, and on August 6, 2014 for the period of August 26, 2014 through August 24, 2015. (Instrument No. 49 at 11 n.14). For the February 26, 2014 through August 26, 2014 FMLA leave period, Plaintiff had exhausted her available hours by July 2014. (Instrument No. 50-1 at 33-34). For her next FMLA leave period, August 2014 through August 2015, Plaintiff had exhausted her leave within the first month. Id. at 42.
On October 8, 2014, Defendant issued to Plaintiff an attendance-based termination [*7]  warning. (Instrument No. 49 at 12). Plaintiff applied for a personal leave of absence from October 22, 2014 to November 30, 2014. Id. Plaintiff received another termination warning in April 2015. (Instrument No. 50-2 at 170).

3.
Plaintiff's sick calls were mostly covered under her intermittent FMLA leave. (Instrument No. 49 at 12). At times, when Plaintiff was unable to report for duty and failed to give Defendant two-hours' advance notice, she would convert the cancellation into intermittent FMLA leave, providing Defendant with documentation of her anxiety and disorder. (Instrument No. 53 at 9). Plaintiff had to appeal to Defendant's Leave of Absence department to convert any Missed Trip to FMLA intermittent leave. (Instrument No. 49 at 12). On May 15, 2015, Plaintiff appealed several missed trips; she stated that she had an episode while getting ready for work on March 6-8 and March 28; and she also had an episode while driving to work on April 16-17. (Instrument No. 50-1 at 37). Janette Geiser ("Geiser"), Defendant's Leave of Absence Department Director, reviewed Plaintiff's Missed Trip appeal and approved them for FMLA leave. (Instrument No. 49 at 12).
Geiser testified that after [*8]  reviewing Plaintiff's Missed Trip appeal, which showed an increased number of episodes between her 2013 and 2014 FMLA certifications, she became concerned about Plaintiff's ability to safely perform her position. (Instrument No. 50-3 at 12-16). Geiser referred the matter to Defendant's Employee Relations, which referred Plaintiff for a fitness for duty exam under the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. (Instrument No. 49 at 13). Defendant subsequently held a meeting with Plaintiff to notify her that Defendant had requested the fitness for duty exam because of Plaintiff's excessive absenteeism, Missed Trips, and medications. Id.
On May 29, 2015, Plaintiff was examined by a licensed psychologist, Dr. Camille Shea. (Instrument No. 51-3 at 11-12). Dr. Shea concluded that in her opinion Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job within the restriction of flights limited to 1-2 days (24-48 hours) of travel. Id. Dr. Shea did not believe that Plaintiff posed a safety risk to herself or others. Id. at 12. Dr. Shea's report also noted that Plaintiff's inability to perform her job functions was a result of her panic attacks, not from adverse medication effects. Id. at 14.
After Defendant [*9]  received the results of the fitness for duty exam, management discussed it to see if Defendant could accommodate Plaintiff to a 1-2 day trip restriction. (Instrument No. 50-4 at 15). Defendant ultimately determined that, under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, seniority, and how trips are built, it could not accommodate Plaintiff. Id. On June 16, 2015, Defendant explained to Plaintiff that she was not clear to fly based on her restricted travel and presented her with two options: (1) take a Medical Leave of Absence to seek treatment for her anxiety; or (2) seek a second medical opinion. (Instrument No. 49 at 14). Plaintiff chose to go on medical leave and seek treatment. Id.
Plaintiff began seeing a therapist, Dr. Rita Cowan, for treatment. (Instrument No. 49 at 14). Dr. Cowan testified that she understood that the purpose of her sessions with Plaintiff was to help Plaintiff handle the stress of four day trips so that Plaintiff could work trips of over 1-2 days in duration. Id. Dr. Cowan believed that Plaintiff could improve her anxiety with 10-12 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy. Id. By August, Dr. Cowan perceived that Plaintiff had lost interest in therapy. Id. After six [*10]  months, Plaintiff voluntarily quit her treatment with Dr. Cowan. Id. at 15. Plaintiff never obtained a release from Dr. Cowan or requested to return to work. Id. Plaintiff remains on Medical Leave of Absence, which may last up to five years pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Id.
On August 4, 2015, while Plaintiff was still on Medical Leave of Absence, Plaintiff emailed the Leave of Absence department to "extend" her FMLA without reapplying for it. (Instrument No. 50-1 at 36-37). Plaintiff was told that she must reapply, which she did on August 10, 2015, with the certification of her psychiatric nurse practitioner, Angela Alesi. Id. at 19. Defendant denied her FMLA leave because she did not meet the required minimum hours worked to be eligible. Id. at 23.

B.
Plaintiff filed her Original Complaint against Defendant on April 2, 2016. (Instrument No. 1). Plaintiff amended her Complaint on August 3, 2016. (Instrument No. 19). Plaintiff brings causes of action for discrimination based on the FMLA, discrimination based on the ADA, constructive discharge, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and retaliation. Id. Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss, contending that any interpretation of the Collective [*11]  Bargaining Agreement had to be done in arbitration. (Instrument No. 24). The Court denied Defendant's Motion to Dismiss on February 27, 2017. (Instrument No. 29).
On February 1, 2018, Defendant filed its Motion for Summary Judgment. (Instrument No. 49). Plaintiff filed its Cross Motion for Summary Judgment on February 1, 2018. (Instrument No. 52). Plaintiff filed its Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on February 15, 2018, (Instrument No. 61), and later amended its Response on February 21, 2018, (Instrument No. 64), after Defendant objected that Plaintiff improperly incorporated by reference the entirety of her Motion for Summary Judgement, Memorandum in Support, and the attached exhibits to her Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Instrument No. 63). Defendant filed its Reply in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment on February 20, 2018. (Instrument No. 62). Defendant also filed its Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on March 9, 2018. (Instrument No. 70).

II.
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is [*12]  no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); Warfield v. Byron, 436 F.3d 551, 557 (5th Cir. 2006).
The "movant bears the burden of identifying those portions of the record it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Triple Tee Golf Inc. v. Nike, Inc., 485 F.3d 253, 261 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-25). "A fact is 'material' if its resolution in favor of one party might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing law." Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Tex., 560 F.3d 316, 326 (5th Cir. 2009). An issue is "genuine" if the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
If the burden of proof at trial lies with the nonmoving party, the movant may satisfy its initial burden by "showing — that is, pointing out to the district court — that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. While the party moving for summary judgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, it does not need to negate the elements of the nonmovant's case. Boudreaux v. Swift Transp. Co., 402 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). "If the moving party fails to meet [its] initial burden, the motion [for summary judgment] must be denied, regardless of the nonmovant's response." United States v. $92,203.00 in U.S. Currency, 537 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc)).
After the moving party has met its burden, in order to "avoid a [*13]  summary judgment, the nonmoving party must adduce admissible evidence which creates a fact issue concerning the existence of every essential component of that party's case." Thomas v. Price, 975 F.2d 231, 235 (5th Cir. 1992). The party opposing summary judgment cannot merely rely on the contentions contained in the pleadings. Little, 37 F.3d at 1075. Rather, the "party opposing summary judgment is required to identify specific evidence in the record and to articulate the precise manner in which that evidence supports his or her claim," Ragas v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir. 1998); Baranowski v. Hart, 486 F.3d 112, 119 (5th Cir. 2007). Although the court draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Connors v. Graves, 538 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir. 2008), the nonmovant's "burden will not be satisfied by some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, by conclusory allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a scintilla of evidence." Boudreaux, 402 F.3d at 540 (quoting Little, 37 F.3d at 1075). Similarly, "unsupported allegations or affidavit or deposition testimony setting forth ultimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment." Clark v. Am.'s Favorite Chicken, 110 F.3d 295, 297 (5th Cir. 1997).
In deciding a summary judgment motion, the district court does not make credibility determinations or weigh evidence. E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., LP, 570 F.3d 606, 612 n.3 (5th Cir. 2009). Nor does the court "sift through the record in search of evidence to support a party's opposition [*14]  to summary judgment." Jackson v. Cal-Western Packaging Corp., 602 F.3d 374, 379-80 (5th Cir. 2010); Malacara v. Garber, 353 F.3d 393, 405 (5th Cir. 2003); Ragas, 136 F.3d at 458; Nissho-Iwai Am. Corp. v. Kline, 845 F.2d 1300, 1307 (5th Cir.1988) (it is not necessary "that the entire record in the case ... be searched and found bereft of a genuine issue of material fact before summary judgment may be properly entered"). Therefore, "[w]hen evidence exists in the summary judgment record but the nonmovant fails even to refer to it in the response to the motion for summary judgment, that evidence is not properly before the district court." Malacara, 353 F.3d at 405.
When the parties cross-move for summary judgment, the court must review "each party's motion independently, viewing the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Ford Motor Co. v. Texas Dep't of Transp., 264 F.3d 493, 498 (5th Cir. 2001).

III.

A.
Defendant moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims of discrimination and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code. (Instrument No. 49). Defendant contends that (1) Plaintiff does not qualify for her position as a flight attendant because of her fear of flying and anxiety; (2) she did not engage in an ADA protected activity when she applied for FMLA leave; (3) Defendant's conduct was legitimate, non-discriminatory, and non-retaliatory; (4) Defendant's referral of Plaintiff for a fitness for duty examination [*15]  was not a violation of the ADA; (5) Defendant did not fail to accommodate Plaintiff because FMLA leave is not a reasonable accommodation request; and (6) Plaintiff is a direct threat to the safety of herself and others. Id.
Plaintiff cross-moves for summary judgment on her claims of discrimination and retaliation under the ADA. (Instrument No. 52). Plaintiff broadly contends that the "record makes it clear that Iraina Stephens was qualified for the job of a flight attendant." (Instrument No. 53 at 22). Plaintiff essentially argues that because she was never reprimanded on the job and because she performed as a flight attendant for many years without any concern from her supervisor, she was qualified for her job. Id.; (Instrument No. 64 at 3). Plaintiff further contends that Defendant only took Plaintiff off flight attendant duty and mandated a fitness for duty examination after it learned that Plaintiff took medication for bipolar and ADHD. Id. Plaintiff contends that Defendant's conduct was based on its negative perceptions of people who are bipolar and therefore was discriminatory. Id. at 22-23. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant should not have held Alesi's errors on her FMLA paperwork against [*16]  Plaintiff and that Plaintiff's missed call outs had not changed in number by 2015. (Instrument No. 64 at 8-9). Plaintiff also contends that she asked to be allowed to use Defendant's system to manage her own schedule to be compliant with the fitness for duty examination, but that Defendant refused to accommodate her and placed her on medical leave. (Instrument No. 53 at 29-30).

1.
The Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") prohibits an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112. Because one purpose of Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code is to "bring Texas law in line with federal laws addressing discrimination, federal case law may be cited as authority" for Chapter 21.2Specialty Retailers, Inc. v. DeMoranville, 933 S.W.2d 490, 492 (Tex. 1996). To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that she has a disability; (2) that she was qualified for the job; and (3) that she was subject to an adverse employment decision on account of her disability. E.E.O.C. v. LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 697 (5th Cir. 2014). If an employee meets her burden in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action. Id. at 701. Once the [*17]  employer meets its burden, the burden shifts back to the employee to offer evidence that the employer's proffered reason is not true, but a pretext for the employer's conduct. Id. at 702.

Qualified Individual
Here, the parties dispute whether Plaintiff is a "qualified individual" to perform her job as a flight attendant. An otherwise qualified person is one who is able to meet all of the program's requirements in spite of her handicap. Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, 174 F.3d 615, 619 (5th Cir. 1999). To avoid summary judgment, a plaintiff needs to show that (1) she could perform the essential functions of the job in spite of her disability; or (2) that a reasonable accommodation of her disability would have enabled her to perform the essential functions of the job. Id. A court considers on a case-by-case basis the employer's written description of the job and actual requirements of the job to determine whether a function of the job is "essential" LHC Grp., 773 F.3d at 698. "'Essential functions' are 'fundamental,' as opposed to 'marginal,' job duties, such that a job is 'fundamentally altered' if an essential function is removed." Credeur v. La. through Credeur, 860 F.3d 785, 792 (5th Cir. 2017) (citations omitted).
Defendant's "Flight Attendant" written job duties include "Resassur[ing] passengers in the event of any safety [*18]  related incidence encountered during flight," and require an ability to withstand a work environment that may include "Rotating schedule with variable hours that could include up to 16 hour duty days, holidays and weekends," "Confined spaces," and "Frequent and continuous contact with others." (Instrument No. 50-2 at 73). These are the very duties that the record shows that Plaintiff cannot perform on trips longer than 1-2 consecutive days.
Section 4.1 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement requires flight attendants to be available for a "full schedule." (Instrument No. 50-2 at 107). While Section 4.1 does not define a "full schedule," it refers to Section 5, entitled "Scheduling," which states that flight attendants may have six consecutive days of duty. (Instrument No. 50-2 at 111). Defendant asserts that this availability is necessary because of complicated scheduling systems in the airline industry, aircraft maintenance, aircraft repositioning and weather. Defendant's Flight Attendant Handbook further requires that absent flight attendants make call-outs no less than two hours before their scheduled duty-in.
The record shows that Defendant expected its flight attendants to be available to work longer than 1-2 [*19]  consecutive days. Regular attendance is an essential function of most jobs. Hypes v. First Commerce Corp., 134 F.3d 721, 727 (5th Cir. 1998) (affirming the district court's conclusion that it was an essential function of an employee's job to arrive at work as close to normal business hours as possible and work a full schedule). The Court finds that regular attendance for a full schedule is an essential function of Plaintiff's position as a flight attendant. Particularly because constraints such as changing weather, aircraft repositioning, and aircraft maintenance impact the ability for airlines to run on schedule, it is important for airline operations that a flight attendant work a full schedule. Defendant's planes only have a single flight attendant for every plane trip. Thus, it is also imperative for the safety of the flight passengers that flight attendants be able to work a full schedule without suffering from paralyzing anxiety attacks. Plaintiff herself admits that her anxiety prevents her from flying trips over 1-2 consecutive days. Angela Alesi concluded that Plaintiff should not fly more than 1-2 consecutive days because Plaintiff's anxiety attacks could jeopardize passenger safety. Dr. Camille Shea, Plaintiffs fitness for duty examiner, [*20]  also concluded that Plaintiff should not fly more than 1-2 consecutive days. The evidence in the record is clear that Plaintiff cannot fly a full schedule. Plaintiff also cannot always notify Defendant in a timely manner when she cannot fly a scheduled trip. Her anxiety, which is caused by her fear of leaving home, being around other people, and confined spaces, is sudden onset. Accordingly, Plaintiff is not a qualified individual to perform her responsibilities as a flight attendant.
Plaintiff contends that because she was a flight attendant for Defendant for years without any reported issues, she remains qualified to serve as a flight attendant. (Instrument No. 53 at 22). This argument does not establish that Plaintiff is qualified to be a flight attendant. It only establishes that either Defendant did not recognize that Plaintiff was not qualified to serve as a flight attendant for years, or that her inability to serve did not manifest itself for some time. Defendant does not have to wait for Plaintiff to have a debilitating anxiety attack at 30,000 feet before it finds Plaintiff unfit to serve as a flight attendant.
Plaintiff has not shown that she is an individual who can perform [*21]  the essential functions of her job as a flight attendant. Therefore, she cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA.
Even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of discrimination, Defendant has provided a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the fitness for duty examination and her subsequent placement on medical leave. The record shows that Defendant referred Plaintiff for the fitness for duty examination because of its concerns regarding Plaintiffs ability to safely perform her position because of her excessive absenteeism, short callouts, and potentially impairing medication. The only evidence Plaintiff has produced to show pretext is that two of Defendant's employees considered Plaintiff's bipolar and ADHD medications as a reason for the fitness for duty examination. In referring a fitness for duty examination, however, the employer may consider the impact an employee's medications may have on the employee's ability to perform her job safely. See, e.g., Martin v. Bayland Inc., 181 F. App'x 422, 425 (5th Cir. 2006) ("district court did not err in considering safety as one of Balyand's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons."); see also 14 C.F.R. § 91.17(a)(3) ("No person may act or attempt to act as a crewmember of a civil aircraft [*22]  . . . [w]hile using any drug that affects the person's faculties in any way contrary to safety"). Plaintiff's assertion that the fitness for duty examination was based on prejudicial views of people with bipolar and ADHD is mere speculation unsupported by the record. She has shown no evidence that brings Defendant's legitimate reason to doubt.

Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff further contends that Defendant should have accommodated her by accepting her FMLA request and adjusting the bidding procedures to allow her to trade trips and self-select trips under 48 hours. (Instrument No. 53 at 28). Under the ADA, discrimination includes a failure to make "'reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship.'" Feist v. La., Dep't of Justice, Office of the Atty. Gen., 730 F.3d 450, 452 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). To establish a failure to accommodate claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the plaintiff is a "qualified individual with a disability;" (2) the disability and its consequential limitations were "known" by the covered employer; and (3) the employer failed to make "reasonable accommodations" for such known [*23]  limitations. Id. However, the "ADA does not require an employer to relieve an employee of any essential functions of his or her job, modify those duties, reassign existing employees to perform those jobs, or hire new employees to do so." Burch, 174 F.3d at 621 ("Since one of the essential duties of any firefighter is to fight fires, if [plaintiff] cannot perform that duty, then he cannot be reasonably accommodated as a matter of law.").
The record here shows that Plaintiffs request for accommodations was not reasonable. A request for FMLA leave necessarily means that the employee cannot perform the functions of her position, in this case flying in cramped spaces around other people and being away from home for more than 1-2 consecutive days. Hence, the Fifth Circuit has explained that "a request for FMLA leave is not a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." Acker v. Gen. Motors, L.L. C., 853 F.3d 784, 791 (5th Cir. 2017).
Plaintiffs request to adjust the bidding system is also unreasonable. The Collective Bargaining Agreement provides for a seniority-based bidding system. Where a requested accommodation violates the rules of a seniority system, it will ordinarily be unreasonable unless the employee can show special circumstances that would render the accommodation [*24]  reasonable. U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 403-05 (2002). Defendant has shown that adjusting Plaintiffs bids so she can obtain flights of less than 48 hours would violate the seniority-based bidding system in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Plaintiff has produced no evidence showing that in her particular case Defendant should make an exception to its seniority policy. But even if she could, there would still be no guarantee that Plaintiff would fly for less than 48 hours as a result of inclement weather or airplane mechanical issues. Thus, Plaintiffs claim of failure to accommodate fails, and Plaintiff has not met her burden of establishing her prima facie case.

Direct Threat
Defendant has also raised the affirmative defense that Plaintiff poses a direct threat to the safety of herself and others because she is the only flight attendant on her flights. (Instrument No. 49 at 21-22). "The ADA does not protect an employee who poses a direct threat to the health and safety of herself or others in the workplace." E.E.O.C. v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 480 F.3d 724, 731 (5th Cir. 2007). A direct threat means "a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(r).
It is undisputed that Plaintiff's [*25]  position is a safety sensitive one and that she is the only flight attendant on her flights. Defendant cannot guarantee that Plaintiff will have only flight schedules of less than 48 hours because of the nature of her job as a flight attendant. Although Plaintiff contends that she poses no direct threat because she has flown for years as a flight attendant and takes medication to treat her anxiety, the record supports otherwise. Plaintiff cannot work a full schedule because she suffers from paralyzing anxiety from being in cramped spaces and around other people. Alesi testified that this anxiety is sudden onset and results in Plaintiff shutting down and being unable to think rationally. An anxiety episode while Plaintiff is flying could be catastrophic for the passengers and crew on board the plane and is something that no employer should be forced to allow. Plaintiff sought treatment for her anxiety, but voluntarily stopped treatment after she lost interest in it. Consequently, Plaintiff is a direct threat to the health and safety of flight passengers anytime she flies over 1-2 days of travel. Because the nature of her position as a flight attendant means that Defendant cannot guarantee [*26]  that she will not fly less than 48 hours, the Court finds that Plaintiff poses a direct threat in her position as a flight attendant.
Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs claims of discrimination and failure to accommodate under the ADA and Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code is GRANTED. (Instrument No. 49).

2.
Plaintiff contends that the fitness for duty examination violated Plaintiff's ADA rights. (Instrument No. 64 at 8-9). Plaintiff specifically asserts that Defendant should not have held Alesi's errors on Plaintiff's FMLA applications against Plaintiff and that Defendant harbored negative assumptions about people with bipolar and ADHD when it referred Plaintiff for the fitness for duty examination. Id. Defendant contends that it referred Plaintiff for the fitness for duty exam because it became concerned that Plaintiffs increasing absenteeism, short callouts, and impairing medications could impact her ability to safely perform her job. (Instrument No. 49 at 19).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under either the ADA or Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code, a plaintiff must prove that (1) she participated in a protected activity; (2) her employer [*27]  took an adverse employment action against her; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. Feist v. La., Dep't of Justice, Office of theAtty. Gen., 730 F.3d 450, 454 (5th Cir. 2013). As with a discrimination claim under the ADA or Chapter 21, once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its decision. Id. After the employer makes this showing, the burden shifts again to the employee to demonstrate pretext. Id. A showing of pretext requires the employee to show "'a conflict in substantial evidence' on the question of whether the employer would not have taken the action tut for' the protected activity." Id. (quoting Long v. Eastfield Coll., 88 F.3d 300, 308 (5th Cir. 1996)).
Even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Defendant has shown a legitimate, nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reason for referring Plaintiff for the fitness for duty examination. As mentioned previously, Defendant's concern about Plaintiff's ability to safely perform her position as a flight attendant is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reason for a fitness for duty examination referral, especially given that Plaintiff's position as a flight attendant is a safety-sensitive position. [*28]  See section III.A.1.
Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's claims of retaliation under the ADA and Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code is GRANTED. (Instrument No. 49). Plaintiff's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment on these claims is DENIED. (Instrument No. 52).

B.
Defendant moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims of discrimination and retaliation under the FMLA. (Instrument No. 49). Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot establish a FMLA claim because she cannot perform the essential functions of her position and she has not met the minimum hours to entitle her to FMLA leave. Id. at 23-24.
Plaintiff separately moves for summary judgment on her FMLA claims. (Instrument No. 52). Plaintiff contends that Defendant interfered with Plaintiff's FMLA rights when it caused Plaintiff to fall below her minimum hours for FMLA eligibility because of the fitness for duty referral. Id. at 17. Plaintiff further contends that Defendant denied Plaintiff FMLA leave for the August 2015-2016 time period after it took her off active duty and placed on her conditions for reinstatement that make it impossible for her to return to work. Id. at 19.
The FMLA makes it unlawful for an employer to interfere [*29]  with an employee's FMLA rights. 29 U.S.C. § 2615. To establish a prima facie case for FMLA interference, a plaintiff must show that (1) she was an eligible employee; (2) her employer was subject to FMLA requirements; (3) she was entitled to leave; (4) she gave proper notice of her intention to take FMLA leave; and (5) her employer denied her the benefits to which she was entitled under the FMLA. Caldwell v. KHOU-TV, 850 F.3d 237, 245 (5th Cir. 2017). A plaintiff need not show discriminatory intent to establish her claim of FMLA interference. Cuellar v. Keppel Amfels, L.L.C., 731 F.3d 342, 349, 351 (5th Cir. 2013) (Elrod, J. concurring). "As with the ADA, however, even if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, [s]he may not overcome a motion for summary judgment if the employer articulates a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the employment action at issue" unless the plaintiff raises an issue of material fact that the employer's proffered reason was pretextual. Caldwell, 850 F.3d at 245.
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FMLA, a plaintiff must show that (1) she was protected under the FMLA; (2) she suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) either (3a) she was treated less favorably than an employee who had not requested leave under the FMLA, or (3b) the adverse decision was made because she took FMLA leave. [*30]  Bocalbos v. Nat'l W. Life Ins. Co., 162 F.3d 379, 383 (5th Cir. 1998). As with a claim of discrimination under the FMLA, once a plaintiff establishes her prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. Once the employer has done so, the plaintiff has the burden to show pretext. Id.
Plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to her FMLA interference claim. As the Court discussed previously, Plaintiff is not able to perform the essential functions of her job and her performance as a flight attendant working a full schedule poses a direct threat of safety to herself and flight passengers. See Section III.A. Individuals who are unable to perform the essential functions of their job are not entitled to FMLA benefits, including leave. See Hatchett v. Philander Smith Coll., 251 F.3d 670, 677 (8th Cir. 2001) ("The FMLA does not require an employer to allow an employee to stay in a position that the employee cannot perform. This type of claim is addressed under the ADA.").
Plaintiff's contention that Defendant took her off schedule from May 22, 2015 to cause her to fall below her minimum number of hours for FMLA eligibility fails also. Plaintiff has pointed to no caselaw, and the Court has found none, that requires an employer [*31]  to reinstate an employee who is not fit for duty to her position just so she can earn the hourly requirement for FMLA eligibility. "[Ain employee who requests or takes protected leave under the FMLA is not entitled to any greater rights or benefits than he would be entitled to had he not requested or taken leave." Grubb v. Sw. Airlines, 296 F. App'x 383, 391 (5th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation omitted). After Defendant referred Plaintiff for a fitness for duty examination, Defendant gave Plaintiff two options for reinstatement: seek a second medical opinion, or take a medical leave of absence to seek treatment so she could fly trips over 48 hours in duration. Plaintiff chose to seek treatment, but failed to complete her treatment. That failure and Defendant's subsequent refusal to reinstate her does not present a triable issue of fact on Plaintiff's interference claim.
Similarly, Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim fails. Defendant took Plaintiff off duty after the results of her fitness for duty examination. Because she took a medical leave of absence, Plaintiff did not work enough hours to be eligible for FMLA leave during the 2015-2016 period that she applied for. A flight attendant who has not met the minimum FMLA hours is, as a matter of [*32]  law, not entitled to FMLA leave. 29 U.S.C. § 2611(2)(D). Plaintiff cannot seek to circumvent the statutory prerequisites for bringing an FMLA claim by asserting that she hypothetically would have worked enough hours had she not gone on medical leave. Buchanan-Rushing v. Cityof Royse City, Tex., 794 F. Supp. 2d 687, 696 (N.D. Tex. 2011) (rejecting argument that the plaintiff would have qualified as an FMLA eligible employee but for the defendant's adverse employment action). Plaintiff has not only failed to show that she was entitled to FMLA leave, but she has also failed to rebut the evidence in the record that establishes that Defendant's conduct was nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory towards her.
Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA claims is GRANTED. (Instrument No. 49). Plaintiff's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment on her FMLA claims is DENIED. (Instrument No. 52).

C.
Plaintiff has brought a claim against Defendant for intentional infliction of emotional distress because of Defendant's alleged discrimination against Plaintiff. (Instrument No. 19 at 8). Defendant moved for summary judgment on this claim. (Instrument No. 49 at 25). Plaintiff failed to respond to Defendant's motion and therefore she waived her claim of intentional infliction of emotional [*33]  distress. Moreover, Plaintiff's claim is based on the same underlying facts as her employment dispute. Plaintiff does not allege independent facts from her employment discrimination claims and provides no independent basis for her claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Zeltwanger, 144 S.W.3d 438, 448 (Tex. 2004) ("If the gravamen of a plaintiff's complaint is the type of wrong that the statutory remedy was meant to cover, a plaintiff cannot maintain an intentional infliction claim regardless of whether he or she succeeds on, or even makes, a statutory claim.").
Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress is GRANTED. (Instrument No. 49).

D.
Plaintiff has brought a claim against Defendant for constructive discharge. (Instrument No. 19 at 8). Defendant moved for summary judgment on this claim. (Instrument No. 49 at 25). Plaintiff failed to respond to Defendant's motion and therefore she waived her claim of constructive discharge. Constructive discharge is not a separate cause of action, but rather, "permits an employee to satisfy the element of 'adverse employment action' despite having voluntarily quit." Carlton v. Houston Cmty. Coll., 2012 WL 3628890 at *17 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Aug. 23, 2012, no pet.) (citing Cox v. Waste Mgmt. of Tex., Inc., 300 S.W.3d 424, 435 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2009, pet. denied)). Because Plaintiff remains [*34]  employed with Defendant under medical leave, a claim of constructive discharge does not apply here.
Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's claim of constructive discharge is GRANTED. (Instrument No. 49).

V.
For the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. (Instrument No. 49). Plaintiff's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. (Instrument No. 52). Plaintiff's claims are DISMISSED.
The Clerk shall enter this rder and provide a copy to all parties.
