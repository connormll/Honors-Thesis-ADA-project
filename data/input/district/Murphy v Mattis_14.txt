Opinion



SUMMARY JUDGMENT ORDER
An employee of the Defense Logistics Agency at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard brings suit against the Secretary of Defense, alleging that the Secretary discriminated against him on the basis of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and his deafness in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. The employee asserts that the Secretary denied him promotions on account of his age and deafness and continuously denied his reasonable accommodation requests.
Before the Court is the Secretary's motion for partial summary judgment. The Secretary seeks judgment as a matter of law on whether the scope of the employee's discrimination claims is limited to a forty-five day period prior to his initial contact with an EEO counselor. Further, the Secretary moves for summary judgment on the employee's failure to promote claims. [*2] 
The Court concludes that the limitations periods contained in the Rehabilitation Act and the ADEA limit the employee's claims to events that occurred within the forty-five day period prior to his contact with the EEO counselor and that neither equitable exceptions nor federal regulations expand the scope of the employee's claims. Further, the Court concludes that the Secretary is entitled to summary judgment on the employee's failure to promote claims because the human resources representative who rejected the employee's promotion application was unaware of the employee's age or disability. The employee's failure to accommodate claim remains for trial.

I. PROCEDURAL POSTURE

A. Pleadings
On October 10, 2014, Michael Murphy brought suit against the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus. Compl. and Demand for Trial by Jury (ECF No. 1). On January 20, 2015, Secretary Mabus filed a motion to dismiss.1 Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss the Compl. (ECF No. 11). Although the pleadings have been amended several times, for purposes of this motion, the operative pleading is Mr. Murphy's Second Amended Complaint against Secretary of Defense James Mattis, filed on May 25, 2016. Second Am. Compl. (ECF No. 56). The Secretary [*3]  answered the Second Amended Complaint the same day it was filed. Def.'s Answer to Second Am. Compl. (ECF No. 57).
On May 6, 2016, the Secretary filed a notice of intent to move for partial summary judgment. Notice of Intent to Move for Summ. J. (ECF No. 46). On May 24, 2016, the Court held a Local Rule 56 pre-filing conference. Min. Entry (ECF No. 53).

B. The Secretary's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
The parties subsequently agreed to eight stipulated facts. Redacted Documents, Attach. 2, Stipulation and J.R. Solely for Purposes of Summ. J. (ECF No. 102) (Stip.). On August 10, 2016, the Secretary filed a motion for partial summary judgment and a statement of undisputed material facts. Redacted Documents, Attach. 3, Def.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (ECF No. 102) (Def.'s Mot.); Redacted Documents, Attach. 4, Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (ECF No. 102) (DSMF). On October [*4]  5, 2016, Mr. Murphy filed a memorandum of law in opposition to Mr. Murphy's motion, a responsive statement of material facts, and an additional set of material facts. Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (ECF No. 73) (Pl.'s Opp'n); Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts and Pl.'s Statement of Additional Material Facts at 1-12 (ECF No. 74) (PRDSMF); Id. at 12-42 (PSAMF). On October 26, 2016, the Secretary filed a reply memorandum and a reply statement of facts. Def.'s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (ECF No. 96) (Def.'s Reply); Reply Statement of Material Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56(d) and 56(e) Responses (ECF No. 97) (DRPSAMF).2

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT FACTS
The Court recounts the facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Murphy consistent with record support. Alfano v. Lynch, 847 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 2017). Although the Court must draw all reasonable inferences in Mr. Murphy's favor, the Court affords no evidentiary weight to "conclusory allegations, empty rhetoric, unsupported speculation, or evidence which, in the aggregate, is less than significantly probative." Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, 637 F.3d 53, 56 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Rogan v. City of Boston, 267 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2001)).

A. Mr. Murphy's Disability
Michael S. Murphy was born in 1943. Stip. ¶ 1. He became profoundly deaf at seven months old as a result of illness.  [*5] Stip. ¶ 2; PSAMF ¶ 7; DRPSAMF ¶ 7. His deafness is a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities such that he is an individual with a disability. Stip. ¶ 3; PSAMF ¶¶ 6, 125; DRPSAMF ¶¶ 6, 125.
Mr. Murphy communicates in American Sign Language (ASL) as his first language. Stip. ¶ 2. He had late access to language and only began formal language learning in ASL at age eight, which is well after the window for which easy acquisition of language can occur. PSAMF ¶ 8; DRPSAMF ¶ 8. Not every deaf person who communicates with ASL is able to read English text; rather, some deaf individuals only see characters because their language is signing. PSAMF ¶ 13; DRPSAMF ¶ 13. Mr. Murphy's own reading, writing, and vocabulary skills in English are quite limited.3 DSMF ¶ 3; PRDSMF ¶ 3. His reading level does not constitute the true reading process; instead, he functions with a word recognition process.4 PSAMF ¶ 10; DRPSAMF ¶ 10.
Mr. Murphy struggles with closed captioning and texting in English.5 PSAMF ¶ 14; DRPSAMF ¶ 14. Mr. Murphy [*7]  can compose and read very basic text messages on his cellphone, compose and read very basic email messages, and compose and read very basic hand-written or typed correspondence without the aid of a friend, co-worker, or an interpreter; in this context, "very basic" means extremely simplistic, consisting of one or two words. DSMF ¶ 4, PRDSMF ¶ 4.6,7 However, when Mr. Murphy wants to send or read an email, he generally gets help from a co-worker to correct his English or explain words he does not understand. DSMF ¶ 4; PRDSMF ¶ 4. Mr. Murphy prefers that all communications with him be in ASL, because "if it's not in ASL, it's not completely coming to me." PSAMF ¶ 15; DRPSAMF ¶ 15 (quoting Redacted Documents, Attach. 5, Dep. of Michael S. Murphy at 64:13-14 (ECF No. 102) (Murphy Dep. June 2015)).

B. Mr. Murphy's Employment at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard

1. Transfer from the Navy to the DLA
From approximately 1979 until June 5, 2010, Mr. Murphy was employed by the Department of the Navy (Navy) as a civilian Materials Handler, WG-06, Step 5, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. Stip. ¶ 4. On June 6, 2010, Mr. Murphy's employment was transferred to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) pursuant to the Department of Defense's base realignment and closure program. Stip. ¶ 5. Since June 6, 2010, Mr. Murphy has been employed by the DLA as a Materials Handler, WG-06, Step 5, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.8 DSMF ¶ 12; PRDSMF ¶ 12. Mr. Murphy is unsure of when his position transferred from the Navy to the DLA. DSMF ¶ 12; PRDSMF ¶ 12. With respect to Mr. Murphy's employment with the Navy from 1979-2010, many of the individuals in Mr. Murphy's prior chain of command have retired or are now deceased.9 DSMF ¶¶ 8-9; PRDSMF ¶¶ 8-9.
The DLA is a combat support agency [*9]  of the Department of Defense. DSMF ¶ 13; PRDSMF ¶ 13. It is distinct from the Navy, which is a separate agency component of the Department of Defense headed by the Secretary of the Navy.10 DSMF ¶ 13; PRDSMF ¶ 13. The Defendant, James Mattis, is the Secretary of Defense and is ultimately responsible for the oversight of the DLA. DSMF ¶ 14; PRDSMF ¶ 14.
The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) office that services Navy employees at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is located on-site at the Shipyard. DSMF ¶ 15; PRDSMF ¶ 15. DLA employees who work at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, such as Mr. Murphy, are serviced by a separate DLA EEO office located in Columbus, Ohio.11 DSMF ¶ 16; PRDSMF ¶ 16. There was some confusion among DLA employees and management about which EEO office serviced DLA employees. DSMF ¶ 16; PRDSMF ¶ 16; PSAMF ¶ 154; DRPSAMF ¶ 154. The DLA EEO expects that the Navy EEO would apprise them of any DLA complaints that were brought to the Navy's office accidently. PSAMF ¶ 155; DRPSAMF ¶ 155.
In 2010, following his transfer to the DLA, Mr. Murphy participated in a video conference with Paul Gambrell, a DLA EEO Disability Program Manager. [*10]  Decl. of Paul Allen Gambrell ¶¶ 5-7 (ECF No. 68). An ASL interpreter translated the video conference. Id.; DSMF ¶ 17; PRDSMF ¶ 17. During the video conference, Mr. Gambrell told Mr. Murphy that the DLA EEO office located in Columbus, Ohio, would provide EEO services to him as a DLA employee, and that if he had any concerns or issues with the DLA, EEO contacts in the Ohio office would provide him with assistance.12 DSMF ¶ 18; PRDSMF ¶ 18. However, following the video conference, Mr. Murphy did not fully understand that the DLA EEO office in Ohio was his designated EEO office. See Dep. of Sheri Kelley at 93:23-10 (ECF No. 76) (Kelley Dep.).

2. Mr. Murphy's Wage History with the DLA
From the date of his transfer to the DLA until 2013, Mr. Murphy earned an hourly salary of $21.25. DSMF ¶¶ 19-22; PRDSMF ¶¶ 19-22. Mr. Murphy received a raise in 2013 and again in 2014, increasing his hourly salary to $21.47 and $21.69, respectively. DSMF ¶¶ 23-24; PRDSMF ¶¶ 23-24. From the date of his transfer to the DLA through 2015, Mr. Murphy's hourly wage was equal to or greater than that paid to his fellow Materials Handler colleagues. DSMF ¶¶ 19-25; [*11]  PRDSMF ¶¶ 19-25. Mr. Murphy testified that his younger Materials Handler co-workers are paid less than he is.13 DSMF ¶ 26; PRDSMF ¶ 26. However, Mr. Murphy has observed his supervisors encourage his younger and non-disabled co-workers to apply for and obtain promotions, whereas Mr. Murphy has never received a promotion over the course of his employment.14 DSMF ¶ 26; PRDSMF ¶ 26; PSAMF ¶ 106; DRPSAMF ¶ 106.

C. Mr. Murphy's Experience as a Deaf Individual Throughout His Employment at the Shipyard

1. Difficulties Communicating with Co-Workers, Supervisors, and EEO Contacts

a. Need for Interpretation
Mr. Murphy's supervisors and DLA EEO contacts are aware that Mr. Murphy's primary language and means of communication is ASL.15 PSAMF ¶¶ 24-25; DRPSAMF ¶¶ 24-25. The DLA is aware that Mr. Murphy's language level, even in ASL, is minimal, and that qualified ASL interpreters with certain skill levels are necessary for Mr. Murphy to communicate successfully with the hearing world. PSAMF ¶ 27; DRPSAMF ¶ 27. An ASL interpreter is supposed to be available for Mr. Murphy on Thursdays from 7:45 A.M. [*12]  to 8:45 A.M. during the weekly department meetings.16 PSAMF ¶ 58; DRPSAMF ¶ 58. However, there is not always an interpreter present at the weekly department meetings; for example, from mid-2012 through mid-2013, an interpreter was absent from approximately six weekly meetings.17 PSAMF ¶ 60; DRPSAMF ¶ 60. Moreover, the ASL interpreter is sometimes late to the meetings. PSAMF ¶ 61; DRPSAMF ¶ 61.
When an interpreter is not present, Mr. Murphy cannot participate in the discussion with his co-workers. PSAMF ¶ 60; DRPSAMF ¶ 60. The expectation is that the Supply Department will not hold the meeting unless there is an interpreter present for Mr. Murphy. PSAMF ¶ 62; DRPSAMF ¶ 62. When there are last minute meetings in the Supply Department and there is no interpreter present for Mr. Murphy to participate, William Fales—Mr. Murphy's second-line supervisor—has told Mr. Murphy to "just wait until Thursday, we will fill you in then." PSAMF ¶ 63; DRPSAMF ¶ 63.
Mr. Fales would often ask Mr. Murphy's co-worker and friend Tanya Knowles to interpret personal [*13]  conversations between him and Mr. Murphy instead of hiring a certified ASL interpreter. PSAMF ¶¶ 21-22; DRPSAMF ¶¶ 21-22. Ms. Knowles is not an ASL interpreter and only "knows" ASL through interactions with Mr. Murphy at work. PSAMF ¶ 21; DRPSAMF ¶ 21. However, when Ms. Knowles tried to interpret the mandatory weekly meetings for Mr. Murphy when an ASL interpreter was absent, Mr. Fales would not let her; rather, Mr. Fales told Mr. Murphy that he would have to wait until next week's meeting when a certified ASL interpreter was present. PSAMF ¶ 23; DRPSAMF ¶ 23. Ms. Knowles also helped Mr. Murphy draft emails to his supervisors and the DLA EEO.18 PSAMF ¶ 20; DRPSAMF ¶ 20.

a. Mr. Murphy's Communications with His Supervisors
Mr. Fales noted in his September 9, 2010 "Memo to File" that "the communication gap [with Mr. Murphy] is hard for all concerned." PSAMF ¶ 16; DRPSAMF ¶ 16. Mr. Dalfonso, Mr. Murphy's first-line supervisor, testified that Mr. Murphy often approaches Mr. Fales with complaints but that "no one can really understand [what] he's complaining about." Sealed Additional Attachs., Attach. 7, Tr. of Dep. of Anthony R. Dalfonso, at 42:18-43:23 [*14]  (ECF No. 86) (Dalfonso Dep.). When Mr. Murphy goes to Mr. Fales' office and attempts to communicate with him using hand gestures, Mr. Fales does not request the assistance of an interpreter or locate some other communication device.19 PSAMF ¶ 18; DRPSAMF ¶ 18. Mr. Murphy has also communicated with his third-line supervisor, Donna Shepheard, using hand gestures and written notes, with no interpreter present the majority of the time.20 PSAMF ¶ 19; DRPSAMF ¶ 19. Although Mr. Murphy's supervisors believe that he can "read lips," Mr. Murphy is unable to "read lips" or speech read. PSAMF ¶ 26; DRPSAMF ¶ 26.
Mr. Murphy's supervisors are generally unaware that there is a difference in the syntax, morphology, and semantics between English and ASL. PSAMF ¶ 28; DRPSAMF ¶ 28. ASL classes were available to all DLA employees and management. PSAMF ¶ 39; DRPSAMF ¶ 39. Mr. Fales attended six of the seven classes offered in Basic ASL.21 PSAMF ¶ 40; DRPSAMF ¶ 40. Before Mr. Fales attended the class, he believed that Mr. Murphy could read English; however, over the course of the class, he learned that [*15]  "the deaf language is . . . like a foreign language." PSAMF ¶ 41; DRPSAMF ¶ 41; Redacted Document, Attach. 1, Tr. of Dep. of William W. Fales, Jr. at 32:3-5 (ECF No. 91-1) (Fales Dep.). Following the course, Mr. Fales was unsure if Mr. Murphy could read or not. PSAMF ¶ 29; DRPSAMF ¶ 29. However, Mr. Fales believed that Mr. Murphy could read English because he knew Mr. Murphy to send and receive emails on his own.22 PSAMF ¶ 30; DRPSAMF ¶ 30. Despite knowing of Mr. Murphy's limited English abilities, Mr. Murphy's supervisors used written notes to communicate with him.23 PSAMF ¶ 28; DRPSAMF ¶ 28.

2. References to Mr. Murphy's Age and Disability in the Workplace
At some point during the course of his employment with the Navy in the 1980s, Mr. Murphy asked his prior supervisor, Butch Fanjoy, to have an interpreter present at a meeting. Mr. Fanjoy responded, "What do you need an interpreter for? I speak sign language," and he gave Mr. Murphy the middle finger.24 PSAMF ¶ 45; DRPSAMF ¶ 45. At other unspecified times, Richard Tank, James Orfanides, and other of Mr. Murphy's co-workers gave Mr. Murphy the [*16]  middle finger and also made signs at Mr. Murphy that translate to "asshole" and "fuck off."25 PSAMF ¶ 46; DRPSAMF ¶ 46. Mr. Murphy's co-workers also tell him to retire because of his age.26 PSAMF 44; DRPSAMF ¶ 44. Additionally, at some point between 1999 and 2010, a co-worker named John Green teased him about never receiving a promotion.27 PSAMF ¶ 43; DRPSAMF ¶ 43.

3. Lack of Accommodations for Mr. Murphy's Disability
Hearing individuals often improperly assume that deaf individuals cannot perform certain jobs because having speech and being articulate is considered equivalent to being intelligent. PSAMF ¶ 42; DRPSAMF ¶ 42. As of 2013, the Shipyard had not held any specific deaf-awareness trainings, other than a short video in 2012. PSAMF ¶ 47; DRPSAMF ¶ 47. Mr. Fales never received any training on how to effectively supervise a deaf employee. PSAMF ¶ 48; DRPSAMF ¶ 48.
Mr. Murphy's first-line supervisor, Anthony Dalfonso, never heard of any discussions regarding providing Mr. Murphy with reasonable accommodations. PSAMF ¶ 49; DRPSAMF ¶ 49. Mr. Murphy requested that fire alarm [*17]  lights—in addition to just a noise based alarm—be installed in the men's bathroom; management is still unsure whether safety lights have been installed. PSAMF ¶ 50; DRPSAMF ¶ 50. When Mr. Murphy told Mr. Fales that he needed to be informed of the same safety information that was provided to his co-workers, Mr. Fales nodded his head but did nothing about Mr. Murphy's request. PSAMF ¶ 51; DRPSAMF ¶ 51.
Mr. Murphy also requested a reasonable accommodation for a forklift license in 2010. PSAMF ¶ 52; DRPSAMF ¶ 52. Mr. Murphy was told that he could not have a forklift license because he was deaf. PSAMF ¶ 53; DRPSAMF ¶ 53. Five years after the forklift license reasonable accommodation request was made, DLA management still had not addressed the request. PSAMF ¶ 54; DRPSAMF ¶ 54. With regard to this request, Mr. Gambrell, the DLA EEO Disability Program Manager, stated: "We . . . were looking at trying to determine what was going on with the forklift license . . . and the fact [was] there were medical limitations and the documentation provided regarding the ability to step up, use ladders, lift, [and] bend . . . may be impacting the forklift license." PSAMF ¶ 55; DRPSAMF ¶ 55. Mr. Gambrell also [*18]  stated: "What I recall . . . is [Mr. Murphy] was unable to step up onto a forklift because of the height and there are restrictions on climbing for [Mr. Murphy]." PSAMF ¶ 56; DRPSAMF ¶ 56. However, Mr. Murphy's medical evaluation, completed by Dr. Edward McAbee on April 24, 2012, states that while Mr. Murphy should not lift or bend, he was able to climb up steps, and that Mr. Murphy's "medical problem should not interfere with his qualifying for a forklift license." PSAMF ¶ 57; DRPSAMF ¶ 57.
Mr. Murphy has also requested help with respect to interpretation services. PSAMF ¶ 64; DRPSAMF ¶ 64. The DLA requires forty-eight hours to schedule an interpreter, although some supervisors erroneously believe the notice requirement is seventy-two hours. PSAMF ¶ 65; DRPSAMF ¶ 65. When there are last minute meetings and there is no interpreter, Mr. Murphy cannot participate. PSAMF ¶ 63; DRPSAMF ¶ 63. Mr. Murphy has informed his supervisors that he cannot participate in meetings unless an interpreter is present, but he felt that his requests for help in this regard have been brushed aside or briefly addressed with no follow through.28 PSAMF ¶ 64; DRPSAMF ¶ 64. Mr. Murphy has been told that interpreters [*19]  are expensive. PSAMF ¶ 64; DRPSAMF ¶ 64. When Mr. Murphy asked for an interpreter to be present at a meeting or social outing, he was told, "Why don't you just teach everyone sign language?" PSAMF ¶ 67; DRPSAMF ¶ 67. Mr. Fales never independently contacted an interpreter during conversations with Mr. Murphy that were outside the context of the weekly meetings. PSAMF ¶ 66; DRPSAMF ¶ 66.
Furthermore, certain means of communication, such as Video Remote Interpreting, are not the right tool or the proper accommodation for every deaf individual. PSAMF ¶ 69; DRPSAMF ¶ 69. The DLA has two videophones on site; although neither one is located in Mr. Murphy's work area, they are located "close to" Mr. Murphy.29 PSAMF ¶ 70; DRPSAMF ¶ 70. The DLA does not use the video phone or the video relay services often to communicate with Mr. Murphy. PSAMF ¶ 72; DRPSAMF ¶ 72. The management does not know how a video phone works, contributing to the underutilization of the video phones. PSAMF ¶ 73; DRPSAMF ¶ 73. The primary means of communication between Mr. Murphy and hearing individuals is through written notes or, less often, through an interpreter. PSAMF ¶ 74; DRPSAMF ¶ 74.

4. Lack of Responsiveness to Deaf Affinity Group Concerns
The Affinity Group is a group of deaf employees at the Shipyard that was formed to address the need for accommodations for deaf employees at the Shipyard, including accommodations needed to access USA Jobs/USA Staffing, the on-line application portal for promotions within the DLA. PSAMF ¶ 75; DRPSAMF ¶ 75. Mr. Murphy's expert witness testified that it would be very important for management to discover what issues deaf employees have by attending Affinity Group meetings at the Shipyard. PSAMF ¶ 76; DRPSAMF ¶ 76.
Ms. Shepheard, Mr. Murphy's third-line supervisor, does not know why the Affinity Group was formed. PSAMF ¶ 77; DRPSAMF ¶ 77. Ms. Shepheard never attended an Affinity Group meeting because "the management was not involved [and] did not go to the Deaf Affinity Group meetings," even though she knew Mr. Murphy "had a concern that we were not attending the Deaf Affinity Group meetings." PSAMF ¶ 78; DRPSAMF ¶ 78. Sheri Kelley, a DLA EEO Specialist, only attended one to three Affinity Group meetings. PSAMF ¶ 79; DRPSAMF ¶ 79. Mr. Dalfonso has never been to an Affinity Group meeting. PSAMF ¶ 80; DRPSAMF ¶ 80. [*21]  Mr. Gambrell never attended an Affinity Group meeting. PSAMF ¶ 81; DRPSAMF ¶ 81.
Mr. Fales believes he attended somewhere between three to eight meetings, but he stopped attending after he told his supervisor, "I think I'm out of my league here as far as attending these meetings." PSAMF ¶ 82; DRPSAMF ¶ 82. Mr. Fales did not follow-up on the issues discussed at the Affinity Group meetings, including: whether deaf employees should have stickers on their hard hats to indicate that they are deaf in case of emergency situations or fires; how deaf employees can receive feedback regarding active shooter drills; how employees can raise issues regarding communication with supervisors; and how deaf employees can provide feedback on video remote interpreting. PSAMF ¶ 83; DRPSAMF ¶ 83. Mr. Fales testified that the Affinity Group meetings at the Shipyard were a "bitch session." PSAMF ¶ 84; DRPSAMF ¶ 84.

D. Mr. Murphy's Failure to Obtain a Promotion
Mr. Murphy has an excellent employment record: he consistently receives positive performance reviews and feedback from his supervisors and has received a number of awards and recognition for his hard work. PSAMF ¶¶ 2-4; DRPSAMF ¶¶ 2-4. He has helped train [*22]  newer and less experienced co-workers, including co-workers who are not disabled and who are much younger than he is. PSAMF ¶ 5; DRPSAMF ¶ 5.
Despite Mr. Murphy's excellent work ethic, Mr. Murphy has never been given a promotion at the Shipyard, either during his tenure with the Navy from 1979 until 2010 or with the DLA from 2010 to the present. PSAMF ¶¶ 85, 99; DRPSAMF ¶¶ 85, 99. Mr. Murphy has the longest length of experience in the Supply Department of the twelve individuals currently stationed there. PSAMF ¶ 86; DRPSAMF ¶ 86. Only four DLA employees in the Supply Department, including Mr. Murphy, have more than thirty-five years of employment.30 PSAMF ¶ 87; DRPSAMF ¶ 87. Of these four employees, only Mr. Murphy has never been promoted. PSAMF ¶ 88; DRPSAMF ¶ 88. For over thirty-five years, Mr. Murphy has consistently expressed his desire to be promoted to his supervisors, co-workers, EEO Specialists, Shipyard counsel, and others. PSAMF ¶ 100; DRPSAMF ¶ 100. From 2007 to September 2013, Mr. Murphy expressed his desire to be promoted to his supervisors at least nineteen times. PSAMF ¶ 89; DRPSAMF ¶ 89. Mr. Murphy's supervisors are aware that not being promoted has been a longstanding [*23]  concern for Mr. Murphy. PSAMF ¶ 101; DRPSAMF ¶ 101. Mr. Murphy has gone to his third-line supervisor, Ms. Shepheard, "on and off" over the years about not being promoted. PSAMF ¶ 103; DRPSAMF ¶ 103.
Mr. Murphy was told many times that he would never be promoted.31 PSAMF ¶ 90; DRPSAMF ¶ 90. In particular, Mr. Fales, Mr. Murphy's current second-line supervisor, told Mr. Murphy that he would "never get promoted because he was deaf."32 PSAMF ¶ 94; DRPSAMF ¶ 94. Additionally, at some point in the 1980s, Mr. Murphy's then-supervisor, Butch Fanjoy, told Mr. Murphy that he would never get promoted. PSAMF ¶ 91; DRPSAMF ¶ 91. At some point between 2002 and 2012, George Stamos, one of Mr. Murphy's prior supervisors, told him that he was "stuck at this level." PSAMF ¶ 93; DRPSAMF ¶ 93. In 2008 or 2009, another prior supervisor, John Green, told Mr. Murphy that he was going to be promoted to a GS-07 position but then told Mr. Murphy that he was "just kidding" about the promotion. PSAMF ¶ 82; DRPSAMF ¶ 82. Mr. Murphy was frustrated because John Green and George Stamos had failed to follow through on their promises to promote him. PSAMF ¶ 102; DRPSAMF ¶ 102.
Mr. Murphy's first-line supervisor, Mr. Dalfonso, does not know of any employee who has been a WG-06 worker for as long as Mr. Murphy. PSAMF ¶ 95; DRPSAMF ¶ 95. According to Mr. Dalfonso, there is essentially no difference in work responsibility between the lesser paid WG-06 position and the higher paid GS-07 position in the Supply Department; however, going from a WG-06 position to a GS-07 position is considered a promotion. PSAMF ¶ 96; DRPSAMF ¶ 96. Mr. Dalfonso does not know of any reason why Mr. Murphy should not be promoted. PSAMF ¶ 97; DRPSAMF ¶ 97. Similarly, Ms. Shepheard believes that Mr. Murphy would be able to perform the functions of a higher-paid Supply Technician. PSAMF ¶ 98; DRPSAMF ¶ 98.
In 1991, despite his hard work and seniority, Mr. Murphy was denied a promotion as an Inventory Management Specialist. PSAMF ¶ 104; DRPSAMF ¶ 104. After applying in 1991, Mr. Murphy sought a promotion by applying to at least thirty-six positions over the fifteen-year period from 2000 to 2015. PSAMF ¶ 105; DRPSAMF [*25]  ¶ 105.

E. Mr. Murphy's 2013 General Supply Specialist Application

1. USA Jobs/USA Staffing
The DLA uses a web-based talent acquisition system called USA Jobs to recruit non-federal government employees for open DLA positions. DSMF ¶ 33; PRDSMF ¶¶ 33. Applicants who already hold federal government employment apply to open DLA positions through USA Staffing, a web-based system that interfaces with USA Jobs. Id. With limited exceptions—such as for temporary promotions of 120 days or less or for promotions based on negotiated EEO settlements—DLA employees who were seeking a promotion to an open DLA position in 2013 were required to apply through USA Staffing.33 DSMF ¶ 34; PRDSMF ¶ 34; PSAMF ¶ 134; DRPSAMF ¶ 134.
Employees can learn about job openings through announcements, written in English, on the USA staffing website.34 PSAMF ¶ 116; DRPSAMF ¶ 116. Sometimes, Mr. Fales notified employees of openings through emails, written in English. PSAMF ¶ 117; DRPSAMF ¶ 117. Mr. Fales also brought up job openings at weekly safety meetings.35 DRPSAMF ¶ 108. However, at certain points over the years, Mr. Murphy's supervisors would [*26]  notify his younger, non-disabled co-workers when there were job openings or promotion opportunities, but they would not let Mr. Murphy know about these opportunities. PSAMF ¶ 108; DRPSAMF ¶ 108. Sometimes, Mr. Murphy's co-workers would forward emails about job openings or promotion opportunities to him. PSAMF ¶ 109; DRPSAMF ¶ 109. On many occasions, Mr. Murphy emailed the Human Resources Office directly to express his interest in the positions. PSAMF ¶ 110; DRPSAMF ¶ 110. Mr. Murphy generally would not receive a response, or the response would be a "no." PSAMF ¶ 111; DRPSAMF ¶ 111.
To apply for a job opening through USA Staffing, DLA employees complete an electronic questionnaire. DSMF ¶ 35; PRDSMF ¶ 35. For some questions, applicants select answers from a drop-down menu that generally contains five answer choices. PSAMF ¶ 120; DRPSAMF ¶ 120. The questionnaire also asks the applicants to rate themselves as "proficient, expert, some knowledge, full knowledge." PSAMF ¶ 121; DRPSAMF ¶ 121. As an example, the questionnaire asks applicants to choose between two different options regarding their knowledge, skills, and abilities:
(1) "I have performed [*27]  this task as a regular part of my job. I have performed it independently and normally without review by a supervisor or senior employee."
(2) "I have performed this task on the job. My work was monitored closely by a supervisor or senior employee to ensure compliance with proper procedures."
PSAMF ¶ 122; DRPSAMF ¶ 122. Based on the applicants' answers, the electronic system generates a numerical ranking. DSMF ¶ 35; PRDSMF ¶ 35. The DLA then reviews the ranking to determine which DLA job applicants are qualified for the positions to which they applied and which candidates to interview. Id.
Mr. Murphy's supervisors admit that the USA Staffing application process is difficult to access and understand. PSAMF ¶ 113; DRPSAMF ¶ 113. Mr. Murphy's supervisors and some members of the DLA EEO do not thoroughly understand the USA Staffing application process, including what information Mr. Murphy needed to provide in order to successfully apply. PSAMF ¶ 130; DRPSAMF ¶ 130. The USA Staffing website and application questionnaire are written in college-level English. PSAMF ¶ 115; DRPSAMF ¶ 115. This makes it essentially inaccessible for someone like Mr. Murphy, whose reading, writing, and vocabulary [*28]  in English are quite limited.36,37 PSAMF ¶ 114; DRPSAMF ¶ 115.
If applicants have questions during the USA Staffing application process, they can reach out to a Human Resources specialist by phone or email; no similar assistance is provided to deaf individuals. PSAMF ¶ 118; DRPSAMF ¶ 118. Some of Mr. Murphy's supervisors and members of the DLA EEO believe that, despite the website being written in English, the USA Jobs application process should not be more difficult to understand if the applicant communicates in ASL or is not fluent in English. PSAMF ¶ 119; DRPSAMF ¶ 119.
The Shipyard arranged an ASL USA Staffing training and instructed the participants on how to navigate the online system.38 PSAMF ¶ 131; DRPSAMF ¶ 131. Mr. Murphy did not attend this training because he was sick. PSAMF ¶ 132; DRPSAMF ¶ 132. The Shipyard informed Mr. Murphy that the ASL USA Staffing navigation training would be rescheduled so that he could attend; however, the training was never rescheduled. Id. DLA management received negative feedback about the ASL USA Staffing navigation training that it did hold. PSAMF ¶ 133; DRPSAMF ¶ 133. No one, however, attempted to reconstruct and reschedule the training. Id.

2. Mr. Murphy Applies Using the USA Staffing Website
Mr. Murphy has been told repeatedly that he must apply through USA Staffing in order to be promoted. PSAMF ¶ 135; DRPSAMF ¶ 135. However, Mr. Murphy did not realize that he had to apply for a promotion using the USA Staffing system until approximately five years ago.39 PSAMF ¶ 112. The first time in 2013 that Mr. Murphy submitted an application for a promotion was on May 4, for the position of Distribution Facilities Specialist.40,41 DSMF ¶ 36; PRDSMF ¶ 36. On May 9, 2013, Mr. Murphy was informed that he had not been selected to interview for the position. DSMF ¶ 37; PRDSMF ¶ 37. Next, Mr. Murphy submitted an application for the position of General Supply Specialist on August 16, 2013, at both the GS-07 and GS-09 levels.42 DSMF ¶ 38; PRDSMF ¶ 38. Although Mr. Murphy has made numerous attempts to obtain a promotion throughout his career at the Shipyard, his August 2013 application to the General Supply Specialist position is the only specific instance he cites in his Second Amended Complaint.43 DSMF ¶ 39; PRDSMF ¶ 39.
The DLA General Supply Specialist position was posted on the USA Staffing system on August 9, 2013, for both the GS-07 and GS-09 levels. DSMF ¶ 40; PRDSMF ¶ 40. Mr. Murphy applied for both the GS-07 and GS-09 positions on August 16, 2013. DSMF ¶ 41; PRDSMF ¶ 41. To apply for the positions, Mr. Murphy electronically filled out and submitted answers to a questionnaire on the USA Staffing system.44 DSMF ¶ 42.
Mr. Murphy was unable to complete the application accurately on his own. PRDSMF ¶ 42. For instance, the electronic questionnaire contained the following question:
6. I am applying for this position to be considered as a:
Person with Disabilities. You must submit a certification statement from a Vocational Rehabilitation Service (state or private), Department of Veterans Affairs, a licensed medical professional (e.g., a Physician or other medical professional duty certified by a State, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory, to practice medicine or provide disability benefits.
A. [*31]  Yes
B. No.
DSMF ¶ 43; PRDSMF ¶ 43. Mr. Murphy answered "B. No" to Question Number 6 of the General Supply Specialist questionnaire. DSMF ¶ 61; PRDSMF ¶ 61. Question Number 6 of the questionnaire was the only solicitation of, or reference to, information regarding disabilities. DSMF ¶ 44; PRDSMF ¶ 44. The questionnaire did not seek or make any reference to the applicants' ages. DSMF ¶ 44; PRDSMF ¶ 44.
The USA Staffing system used the applicants' answers to the General Supply Specialist questionnaire to automatically generate a score of between 70 and 100. DSMF ¶ 46; PRDSMF ¶ 46. This score then automatically generated a ranking list of the applicants, from the highest score to the lowest score. DSMF ¶ 47; PRDSMF ¶ 47. DLA Human Resources Specialist Lori Kendrick was the DLA contact for the General Supply Specialist job announcement at both the GS-07 and GS-09 levels. DSMF ¶ 48; PRDSMF ¶ 48.

3. Mr. Murphy Is Not Selected for the GS-07 General Supply Specialist Position
Ms. Kendrick was the only DLA employee responsible for reviewing the ranking list for the General Supply Specialist position at the GS-07 grade and determining which applications merited further review. DSMF ¶ 49; PRDSMF ¶ [*32]  49. The ranking list for the General Supply Specialist position at the GS-07 list included information that Mr. Murphy entered, as well as the eligibilities he selected and his cumulative score based on his answers.45 DSMF ¶ 50; PRDSMF ¶ 50. Ms. Kendrick reviewed the ranking list, made handwritten notations, and initialed the document. DSMF ¶ 51; PRDSMF ¶ 51. Ms. Kendrick used a cut-off score of 88 out of 100 to determine which applicants to refer to have their resumes and applications reviewed for an interview for the General Supply Specialist position at the GS-07 level. DSMF ¶ 52; PRDSMF ¶ 52. Ms. Kendrick indicated this cut-off score by drawing a line on the ranking list separating the applicants who scored an 88 from those who scored an 87. DSMF ¶ 53; PRDSMF ¶ 53. She did not review the application materials of any candidate with a score of 87 or lower. DSMF ¶ 54; PRDSMF ¶ 54.
Mr. Murphy's answers to the General Supply Specialist questionnaire automatically generated a score of 85, which was below the cut-off. DSMF ¶ 55; PRDSMF ¶ 55. Ms. Kendrick therefore did not review Mr. Murphy's application materials or consider him for referral for an interview. DSMF ¶ 56; PRDSMF ¶ 56. The [*33]  only information Ms. Kendrick possessed and reviewed concerning Mr. Murphy was that contained on the ranking list: his name, address, telephone number, email address, the last four digits of his social security number, that he was a candidate for competitive promotion ("C-PROM"), and that he scored an 85. DSMF ¶ 57; PRDSMF ¶ 57.
If Mr. Murphy had answered "A. Yes" to Question Number 6 of the General Supply Specialist questionnaire indicating that he had applied as a Person with Disabilities, the ranking list would have indicated a designation of "N-PWD" beside his name. DSMF ¶ 59; PRDSMF ¶ 59. Because Mr. Murphy answered "B. No" to Question Number 6 of the questionnaire, a designation of "N-PWD" was not present beside Mr. Murphy's ranking information. DSMF ¶ 58; PRDSMF ¶ 58. Even with a score below the 88 cut-off, had he self-identified as N-PWD, Mr. Murphy's application for General Supply Specialist at the GS-07 grade would have received additional review by Ms. Kendrick. DSMF ¶ 60; PRDSMF ¶ 60; PSAMF ¶ 126; DRPSAMF ¶ 126. If the ranking list indicated that he was N-PWD, his resume would have been reviewed and his application would have been forwarded to the selecting official. Id. [*34] 
Besides the information concerning Mr. Murphy's name, address, telephone number, email address, the last four digits of his social security number, that he was a C-PROM candidate, and that he scored an 85, Ms. Kendrick did not know any other details concerning Mr. Murphy as of August 2013. DSMF ¶ 62; PRDSMF ¶ 62. She did not review any information regarding whether Mr. Murphy had a disability and did not know how old he was when she determined which candidates to select for interviews for the General Supply Specialist positions. DSMF ¶ 63; PRDSMF ¶ 63. She did not review Mr. Murphy's resume, nor did she review any other materials submitted by Mr. Murphy in connection with his application. Id. As of August 2013, Ms. Kendrick did not know whether Mr. Murphy had a disability, and she did not know Mr. Murphy's age. DSMF ¶ 64; PRDSMF ¶ 64.
Ms. Kendrick wrote "IRAT" beside Mr. Murphy's ranking information for the General Supply Specialist position at the GS-07 grade to indicate that he had scored below the cut-off. DSMF ¶ 65; PRDSMF ¶ 65. Mr. Murphy's IRAT rating was provided to him on August 22, 2013, by an email alert from the USA Staffing system, stating in part, "We have not reviewed your [*35]  qualifications for this position because there are higher preference veterans and/or higher ranking candidates that must first be certified and considered." DSMF ¶ 66; PRDSMF ¶ 66.

4. Mr. Murphy Is Not Selected for the GS-09 General Supply Specialist Position
The General Supply Specialist questionnaire contained a question regarding the applicants' minimum qualifications, which asked the applicants to select an answer which best described their highest level of education and/or experience they possessed for the General Supply Specialist position. DSMF ¶ 67; PRDSMF ¶ 67. Mr. Murphy selected the following answer to the question regarding his minimum qualifications:
A - At the GS-07 level. I possess one (1) year of specialized experience that equipped me with the particular knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to successfully perform the duties of the position, and is directly in or related to this position. To be creditable, specialized experience must be at the GS-05 grade level or equivalent under other pay systems in the Federal service, military, or private sector. Examples of specialized experience are listed in the vacancy announcement.46
DSMF ¶ 68; PRDSMF ¶ 68. This answer automatically [*36]  disqualified Mr. Murphy for the General Supply Specialist at the GS-09 grade, because he answered that he had experience equivalent to the GS-07 level. DSMF ¶ 69; PRDSMF ¶ 69. Mr. Murphy's name did not appear on a ranking list for the General Supply Specialist position at the GS-09 grade. DSMF ¶ 70; PRDSMF ¶ 70. Ms. Kendrick did not review any of Mr. Murphy's information with respect to his application for that grade. DSMF ¶ 71; PRDSMF ¶ 71. Mr. Murphy was notified on August 22, 2013, by email alert from the USA Staffing system that he rated "ID" for the General Supply Specialist GS-09 grade, stating, "You do not meet the minimum education and/or experience requirements for this specialty and grade." DSMF ¶ 72; PRDSMF ¶ 72. Mr. Murphy was not selected to interview for the General Supply Specialist position at either the GS-07 or GS-09 level and was informed of this on August 22, 2013. DSMF ¶ 73; PRDSMF ¶ 73. The individuals ultimately selected for the General Supply Specialist position at the GS-07 or GS-09 levels were not disabled and were younger than Mr. Murphy. DSMF ¶ 74; PRDSMF ¶ 74.

F. Mr. Murphy Approaches the EEO

1. The Reasonable Accommodation Process Generally
Reasonable accommodation [*37]  requests are processed by the EEO. PSAMF ¶ 139; DRPSAMF ¶ 139. When a deaf employee requests a reasonable accommodation, the EEO's expectation is that an EEO Specialist will engage an interpreter to determine exactly what the employee is requesting. PSAMF ¶ 140; DRPSAMF ¶ 140. It is the employer's responsibility to discuss with the individual what the request is in order to provide the appropriate reasonable accommodation. PSAMF ¶ 141; DRPSAMF ¶ 141. A reasonable accommodation depends on the individual situation and the individual who is involved. PSAMF ¶ 142; DRPSAMF ¶ 142.
The parties agree that in order to provide an appropriate reasonable accommodation, it is important and helpful to know the reading level of a deaf employee. PSAMF ¶ 143; DRPSAMF ¶ 143. A reasonable accommodations request triggers an "interactive process" between the requesting individual and the management. PSAMF ¶ 144; DRPSAMF ¶ 144. An interactive process is one in which the EEO Specialist communicates with the employee and discusses the requested and necessary accommodations. PSAMF ¶ 145; DRPSAMF ¶ 145. The EEO Specialist will also involve all necessary parties and will sit in a meeting with the employee and [*38]  their supervisor to facilitate the conversation if necessary. Id.
DLA employees are educated about the reasonable accommodations process through policy statements posted throughout the building, which are written in English; there is no employee training. PSAMF ¶ 146; DRPSAMF ¶ 146. There are two methods of educating supervisors about the reasonable accommodation process, one through new supervisor orientation training and one through supervisory mandatory trainings. PSAMF ¶ 147; DRPSAMF ¶ 147. There was no training given to Mr. Murphy's supervisors, Mr. Fales and Mr. Dalfonso, about the reasonable accommodations policy or the reasonable accommodation request procedure. PSAMF ¶ 148; DRPSAMF ¶ 148. Ms. Shepheard cannot describe what constitutes an "interactive process." PSAMF ¶ 149; DRPSAMF ¶ 149. Ms. Shepheard required reasonable accommodation requests to be in writing. PSAMF ¶ 150; DRPSAMF ¶ 150. EEO Specialist Sheri Kelley testified that an employee does not have to use the words "reasonable accommodation" or even submit a written request to trigger the reasonable accommodations process; employees should also be able to make a reasonable accommodation request in ASL. PSAMF ¶ 151; [*39]  DRPSAMF ¶ 151.
EEO Staffing Specialist Charlee Swingle testified that reasonable accommodations can be provided for the USA Staffing application process, where a Staffing Specialist helps the applicant manually fill out the application and upload the requisite documents. Alternatively, applications can also be accepted via fax if the applicant fills out the PDF version of the online application. PSAMF ¶ 152; DRPSAMF ¶ 152. Mr. Murphy's second-line supervisor, Mr. Fales, is the ultimate decision-maker for all of Mr. Murphy's reasonable accommodation requests, even if Mr. Murphy first contacts the Program Disability Manager. PSAMF ¶ 153; DRPSAMF ¶ 153.

2. Mr. Murphy's Pre-2013 Contacts with the EEO
After years of attempting to get a promotion, Mr. Murphy contacted the EEO in 2005 during his employment with the Navy. PSAMF ¶ 157; DRPSAMF ¶ 157. In or about October 2005, Mr. Murphy contacted Terry Burk, an EEO Specialist at the Navy's Shipyard EEO Office, who said he would investigate his claim. PSAMF ¶ 158; DRPSAMF ¶ 158. Terry Burk summarized Mr. Murphy's complaint as follows:
I'm being discriminated by Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Code 500 Management and specifically Jonathan Green due to [*40]  my disability (deaf) with the full support of his supervisor (George Stamos). I have the most experience and have the qualifications necessary, as evidenced by my being placed on the certificate of eligibles [sic] by HRSC-Northeast. I have not been selected for promotion although Jonathan Green has frequently promised that I would get the next promotion. My last promotion which was to WG-06 was effective on July 19, 2007. I believe that if I were not a deaf employee I would have been promoted by now.
For Resolution...I seek to work in an environment that is free from this discriminatory behavior. I seek fair and equal treatment in regards to promotion opportunities, and that management promote me immediately.
PSAMF ¶ 159; DRPSAMF ¶ 159 (alteration in original).
Four months later, Mr. Murphy received an email, written in English, from Lorrie Oeser, EEO Manager of the Navy Shipyard, which stated:
The EEO Office cannot take sides in an issue, but can try to help resolve issues . . . After talking to you and to management, it looks to me like the key here is for you to be viewed by management as the best candidate for promotions. The viewpoint right now is that you are not a top candidate. [*41]  Part of the reason for this is because you are not seen as doing an excellent job in all aspects of your current job.
Here's an idea that might help. Terry Burk can arrange for a job coach to come in on a daily basis to work with you on all tasks involved in your better understanding [sic] of what management says it is looking for. The state (Maine) vocational rehabilitation office offers this service, but we have to be prioritized on a waiting list.
PSAMF ¶ 160; DRPSAMF ¶ 160 (alterations in original). Mr. Murphy disagreed with Ms. Oeser's assessment that he was not the "best candidate" for promotion; rather, he has believed that he was not being promoted due to his disability. PSAMF ¶ 161; DRPSAMF ¶ 161. Mr. Dalfonso did not understand why a job coach was assigned to Mr. Murphy because Mr. Murphy knew how to do his job. PSAMF ¶ 162; DRPSAMF ¶ 162.
In 2006, Mr. Murphy complained to the Navy EEO again about not being promoted, resulting in a mediation. PSAMF ¶ 163; DRPSAMF ¶ 163. Ms. Shepheard attended the mediation. PSAMF ¶ 164; DRPSAMF ¶ 164. No remedy was offered during the mediation. PSAMF ¶ 165; DRPSAMF ¶ 165.
In April 2007, Mr. Murphy contacted the Navy EEO again when he was not [*42]  selected for a promotion. PSAMF ¶ 166; DRPSAMF ¶ 166. Despite contacting the EEO, Mr. Murphy was still not provided with reasonable accommodations that would enable him to effectively navigate and apply for promotions through USA Staffing. PSAMF ¶ 162; DRPSAMF ¶ 162.
On November 18, 2010, following Mr. Murphy's transfer to the DLA, Mr. Murphy informed Mr. Fales that "he wanted to leave supply and get another job on the Shipyard." PSAMF ¶ 168; DRPSAMF ¶ 168. He also said that "he wanted to go to the EEO to get some help with getting another job." PSAMF ¶ 168; DRPSAMF ¶ 168. At a meeting on March 31, 2011, between Mr. Murphy, Mr. Fales, and Ms. Shepheard, Mr. Murphy communicated his desire to seek a promotion.47 PSAMF ¶ 169; DRPSAMF ¶ 169. Mr. Murphy states that he received no assistance at this meeting. Id. However, Mr. Fales' contemporaneous notes summarizing the meeting suggest that they discussed Mr. Murphy "getting in touch with Shipyard EEO for help in placement" and that the supervisors offered Mr. Murphy points of contact at the DLA to assist him. DRPSAMF ¶ 169; Varga Decl., Ex. D, Handwritten Mem. at 5 (ECF No. 86-9). In April 2011, Mr. Murphy contacted the Navy EEO and requested [*43]  help in applying for a promotion; he was not given any help.48 PSAMF ¶ 170; DRPSAMF ¶ 170. At this point, there was some confusion about whose responsibility it was to deal with Mr. Murphy's request due in part to the transfer from the Navy to the DLA.49 PSAMF ¶ 174; DRPSAMF ¶ 174.

3. Mr. Murphy Approaches the EEO After He Was Not Hired for the General Supply Specialist Positions
On August 23, 2013, a day after learning that he was not hired for the General Supply Specialist position at either the GS-07 or GS-09 level, Mr. Murphy went to a Navy EEO Specialist at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard named Ava Drost to make a complaint about not being hired due to his age—Mr. Murphy was 69 years old at the time—and his disability.50 DSMF ¶¶ 75, 79; PRDSMF ¶¶ 75, 79; PSAMF ¶ 175; DRPSAMF ¶ 175. Mr. Murphy arrived at the Navy EEO office as a walk-in on August 23, 2013, without an appointment or notifying the Navy EEO beforehand, and therefore an ASL interpreter was not present.51,52 DSMF ¶ 76; PRDSMF ¶ 76. Although an ASL interpreter was not present, Mr. Murphy brought with him printed notifications that he had [*44]  not been selected for the DLA job opening. DSMF ¶ 77; PRDSMF ¶ 77.
Ms. Drost did not discuss Mr. Murphy's complaint with him; rather, in a handwritten note, Ms. Drost wrote, "Unfortunately, we don't [*45]  service DLA. I can't step in."53 DSMF ¶ 78; PRDSMF ¶ 78; PSAMF ¶ 171; DRPSAMF ¶ 171. She provided him with a print-out of the DLA EEO contacts in Columbus, Ohio, but she took no other steps to ensure Mr. Murphy's understanding. Id.; PSAMF ¶ 178; DRPSAMF ¶ 178.
Mr. Murphy did not fully understand his meeting with Ms. Drost and complained to his department supervisor, who then directed him to speak with his immediate supervisor.54 PSAMF ¶ 182; DRPSAMF ¶ 182. His immediate supervisor contacted Ms. Shepheard, who then communicated with Mr. Gambrell, the Disability Program Manager of the EEO for the DLA Land and Maritime, on August 23, 2013. Id.; PSAMF ¶ 172; DRPSAMF ¶ 172. In her email to Mr. Gambrell, Ms. Shepheard wrote:
I have a deaf employee who is having issues qualify [sic] for jobs, I believe he's having problems completing his resume. Is there assistance available for this gentleman, he's currently a WG-06 Warehouse worker and is not that familiar with computers etc.
He's brought his status paperwork for a GS-07 Supply Tech register which says "you do not meet the minimum education and/or experience requirements for this specialty [*46]  and grade" and has asked me for assistance.
Dep. of Sheri Kelley, Attach. 4, Emails Re: Murphy Resume at 9 (ECF No 76). On August 23, 2013, Mr. Gambrell sent Ms. Shepheard an email and requested that Mr. Murphy send him a copy of his resume. PSAMF ¶ 185; DRPSAMF ¶ 186. Ms. Shepheard does not remember Mr. Murphy ever asking for help with his resume. PSAMF ¶ 186; DRPSAMF ¶ 186. Ms. Shepheard did not follow up with Mr. Gambrell or Mr. Murphy regarding the August 2013 emails. PSAMF ¶ 188; DRPSAMF ¶ 188.
Neither Mr. Gambrell nor Ms. Shepheard viewed Mr. Murphy's request for help with the application and promotion process as a reasonable accommodation request. PSAMF ¶ 184; DRPSAMF ¶ 184. Rather, Mr. Gambrell viewed this as a "request for assistance." PSAMF ¶ 184; DRPSAMF ¶ 184. Mr. Gambrell does not like to "get involved in a tightrope of this is or isn't an actual reasonable accommodations request," despite the fact that his job is to oversee reasonable request accommodation requests. Id.
After emailing Mr. Gambrell his resume the first time and hearing no reply, Mr. Murphy sent Mr. Gambrell his resume again on October 24, 2013. PSAMF ¶ 189; DRPSAMF ¶ 189. On Mr. Murphy's resume, it states: "Language [*47]  Skills: Language Spoken Written Read, American Sign Language Advanced Advanced Advanced"; English was not listed. PSAMF ¶ 190; DRPSAMF ¶ 190. On November 4, 2013, Mr. Gambrell provided Mr. Murphy with instructions—written in English—on how to improve his resume.55 PSAMF ¶ 191; DRPSAMF ¶ 191. Mr. Murphy understood that the email had something to do about his resume, but he did not fully understand Mr. Gambrell's email. PSAMF ¶ 192; DRPSAMF ¶ 192. Mr. Murphy was not seeking job or resume counseling from the EEO; rather, he wanted to file a complaint due to discrimination based on his disability and age, and the resultant inability to obtain a new job, a raise, or a promotion. PSAMF ¶ 194; DRPSAMF ¶ 194. Mr. Murphy was upset with the little help he received from Mr. Gambrell and that Mr. Gambrell did not offer to help him file a complaint.56 PSAMF ¶ 193; DRPSAMF ¶ 193.
Mr. Gambrell believed sending Mr. Murphy an email and making edits to his resume—without any follow-up—constituted an "interactive process." PSAMF ¶ 195; DRPSAMF ¶ 195. For Mr. Murphy's [*48]  request, Mr. Gambrell did not "go through an actual reasonable accommodation analysis and determination." PSAMF ¶ 197 (quoting Dep. of Paul Gambrell at 136:3-5 (ECF No. 78) (Gambrell Dep.)); DRPSAMF ¶ 197. Although it is Mr. Gambrell's policy to follow-up with an employee after receiving information from the employee's supervisor about a reasonable accommodation request, Mr. Gambrell did not contact Mr. Murphy when he received an accommodation request from Ms. Shepheard and instead relied solely on the information that was provided to him. PSAMF ¶ 198; DRPSAMF ¶ 198. Mr. Gambrell never communicated with Mr. Murphy through an interpreter during the process to determine the root of Mr. Murphy's concerns. PSAMF ¶ 196; DRPSAMF ¶ 196. Mr. Gambrell believed that Mr. Murphy's difficulty with computers was more of an information technology issue than a language barrier. PSAMF ¶ 199; DRPSAMF ¶ 199. According to Mr. Gambrell, if he had known that Mr. Murphy was not able to answer the questions on the USA Staffing site and was not able to understand the language, then Mr. Gambrell would have told him, "[L]et's get an interpreter in here to help you understand the questions so you can respond appropriately." [*49]  PSAMF ¶ 200; DRPSAMF ¶ 200.
Ms. Shepheard's August 23, 2013 email informed Mr. Gambrell that Mr. Murphy was "not that familiar with computers." PSAMF ¶ 35; DRPSAMF ¶ 35. Mr. Gambrell also received an email from Ms. Shepheard on December 19, 2013, stating that Mr. Murphy's English is very limited, and that he "really relies on signing." PSAMF ¶ 36; DRPSAMF ¶ 36. Additionally, Mr. Gambrell received emails from Ms. Oeser stating that Mr. Murphy "does not use emails." PSAMF ¶ 34; DRPSAMF ¶ 34. Nevertheless, Mr. Gambrell used email to communicate with Mr. Murphy "[b]ased on the fact that Mr. Murphy provided [him] emails and responded to [his] emails."57 PSAMF ¶ 37; DRPSAMF ¶ 37. According to Mr. Gambrell, this "indicated to [him] at the time that he was capable of corresponding back and forth using emails in the computer." Id. Paul Gambrell stated that even if he learned that a co-worker edited Mr. Murphy's emails, this "in and of itself would not change" his assessment of Mr. Murphy's abilities to communication in English.58 PSAMF ¶ 38; DRPSAMF ¶ 38.
By at least November 21, 2013, DLA EEO contacts were aware that Mr. Murphy felt that his management [*50]  and the servicing EEO office were unresponsive to his request for accommodations. PSAMF ¶ 202; DRPSAMF ¶ 202.59,60 In particular, on November 21, 2013, Ms. Kelley, a DLA EEO Specialist, attended a teleconference with Ms. Oeser to discuss concerns that Mr. Murphy raised at a Deaf Affinity Group meeting, including his inability to get a promotion and his confusion regarding which EEO office serviced him. Dep. of Sheri Kelley, Attach. 1, Memo for Record at 1 (ECF No. 76) (Memo for Record). Following the teleconference, Ms. Kelley wrote to Mr. Gambrell and Ms. Oeser, "Tasks I have taken on: 1. Make sure DLA management at your site is fully aware of how to contact us, EEO and all employees there know how to request reasonable accommodations." PSAMF ¶ 201; DRPSAMF ¶ 201.
On December 10, 2013, Ms. Kelley met with Mr. Murphy, Mr. Dalfonso, and Mr. Fales, and an ASL interpreter via video conference. PSAMF ¶ 179; DRPSAMF ¶ 179; Memo for Record at 1. She informed Mr. Murphy that the EEO that serviced DLA employees was located in Columbus, Ohio, and provided him with contact information. PSAMF ¶ [*51]  179; DRSPAMF ¶ 179; Memo for Record at 1. She also explained to Mr. Murphy how to request an interpreter. PSAMF ¶ 33; DRPSAMF ¶ 33. Additionally, she informed Mr. Murphy that the Shipyard was planning to conduct a second USA Staffing training event and that if it did not take place, she would personally arrange a training session for him. Memo for Record at 1-2. Mr. Murphy could not understand the ASL interpreter because the video teleconference kept freezing. PSAMF ¶ 180; DRPSAMF ¶ 180. Following the video teleconference, Mr. Murphy still did not know how to contact the DLA EEO.61 PSAMF ¶ 181; DRPSAMF ¶ 181.
Although she was aware of Mr. Murphy's limited English language ability and that he was "not that familiar with computers," Ms. Kelley sent Mr. Murphy an email, written in English, following the video conference to inform him that he could contact her at any time if he needed anything or was not comfortable.62 PSAMF ¶¶ 31-33, 35; DRPSAMF ¶ 31-33, 35. She received no indication that he did not understand her email. PSAMF ¶ 32; DRPSAMF ¶ 32. However, on December 19, 2013, she received an email from Ms. Shepheard reiterating that Mr. Murphy's English is very limited, [*52]  and that he "really relies on signing." PSAMF ¶ 36; DRPSAMF ¶ 36.
On December 19, 2013, Mr. Murphy requested training for the USA Staffing application process from the DLA EEO through Ms. Shepheard. PSAMF ¶ 204; DRPSAMF ¶ 204. Ms. Shepheard contacted Mr. Gambrell about the reasonable accommodation, who provided broad, "high level" responses with virtually no specific reference to Mr. Murphy's individual situation. PSAMF ¶ 187; DRPSAMF ¶ 187. Ms. Kelley, who was responsible for responding to accommodation requests at the time, never followed up with Mr. Murphy about USA Staffing training, despite telling Mr. Murphy previously that she would personally set up a USA Staffing training with Mr. Murphy and an interpreter if he ever requested it. PSAMF ¶ 205; DRPSAMF ¶ 205. The only person who agreed to help Mr. Murphy translate the application questionnaire was his friend and co-worker, Ms. Knowles. PSAMF ¶ 206; DRPSAMF ¶ 206. Ms. Knowles is not a supervisor, not a member of DLA management, and is not an ASL interpreter. PSAMF ¶ 206; DRPSAMF ¶ 206.
In total, Mr. Murphy complained to Mr. Fales, Ms. Shepheard, Mr. Dalfonso, Ms. Oeser, and Ms. Kelley fifteen times in 2013 that he was still not [*53]  getting promoted due to his deafness and requested assistance with getting a promotion and the USA Staffing website. PSAMF ¶ 173; DRPSAMF 173.

G. Mr. Murphy Files a Formal Complaint
Mr. Murphy filed his formal EEO complaint of discrimination with the DLA EEO office on February 7, 2014, which was then provided to the DLA Land and Maritime Office of Equal Employment Opportunity & Diversity for investigation on February 13, 2014.63 DSMF ¶ 80; PRDSMF ¶ 80. Mr. Murphy received little help with filing a complaint. PSAMF ¶ 207; DRPSAMF ¶ 207. The formal EEO complaint of discrimination indicated that Mr. Murphy had discussed his complaint with Navy EEO Specialist Ms. Drost—and had first asked to see an EEO counselor—in August 2013.64 DSMF ¶ 81; PRDSMF ¶ 81. However, Mr. Murphy sought assistance from an EEO counselor at least nine times before August 2013. PRDSMF ¶ 81.
The formal EEO complaint of discrimination detailed the alleged discrimination and adverse employment actions to which Mr. Murphy believed he had been subjected. DSMF ¶ 82; PRDSMF ¶ 82. Specifically, besides his failure to accommodate claim, Mr. Murphy asserted "Loss [*54]  of Opportunity/Failure to Promote" and "Unequal Pay" as the illegal employment discrimination adversely affecting his employment.65 DSMF ¶ 83; PRDSMF ¶ 83. Regarding his asserted "Loss of Opportunity/Failure to Promote," Mr. Murphy stated that despite his numerous efforts to obtain a promotion over the years, he had never been given one, with the most recent example being his application for the position of General Supply Specialist at the GS-07 and GS-09 levels in August 2013. DSMF ¶ 84; PRDSMF ¶ 84. Regarding his asserted "Unequal Pay," Mr. Murphy stated that "[f]or years and even now, I have been doing the same work that co-workers do and they are paid more." DSMF ¶ 85; PRDSMF ¶ 85.
As part of the subsequent EEO investigation, Mr. Murphy was asked clarifying questions about his claims.66 PSAMF ¶ 209; DRPSAMF ¶ 209. Specifically, Mr. Murphy's EEO Declaration contains the following question and response:
3. During the period at issue (August 22, 2013), what was your position, series, grade, and geographical location?
A. Actually, August 22, 2013 is not the period at issue necessarily. This complaint has been filed because I have never been promoted or given any other opportunities over the decades [*55]  I have been here and I have been stuck in the same position and WG 6 since about 1985 while my peers and co-workers have moved on to better situations.
Id.; Redacted Document, Attach. 1, Decl. Under Penalty of Perjury at 2 (ECF No. 104) (Murphy EEO Decl.).
On December 11, 2014, Plaintiff received the final agency decision by the DLA on his formal EEO complaint. DSMF ¶ 86; PRDSMF ¶ 86. The decision focused on the August 22, 2013 failure to promote and characterized Mr. Murphy's failure to accommodate claim as a request to create a "deaf friendly culture." PSAMF ¶ 210; DRPSAMF ¶ 210. The decision did not address the allegations [*56]  that the Secretary had failed to promote Mr. Murphy "over the decades" as a result of his disability. Id. (quoting Murphy EEO Decl. at 2).

III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS

A. Mr. Murphy's Second Amended Complaint
Mr. Murphy asserts the following claims:

1. Count I: Failure to Promote on the Basis of Disability
In Count I of Mr. Murphy's Second Amended Complaint, Mr. Murphy alleges that the Secretary breached his legal obligations under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 791 et seq., by denying Mr. Murphy employment opportunities due to his deafness. Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 47-55. Mr. Murphy asserts that despite being qualified and able to perform the essential duties of the available positions, he was passed over for employment in favor of less qualified, non-disabled candidates. Id. ¶ 50.

2. Count II: Failure to Accommodate
In Count II, Mr. Murphy alleges that the Secretary failed to make reasonable accommodations for his disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act and that the Secretary failed to engage in a good faith, interactive process with Mr. Murphy concerning his need for accommodations. Id. ¶¶ 56-65. Further, Mr. Murphy asserts that the Secretary did not select Mr. Murphy for the General Supply Specialist [*57]  position or other positions due in part to a fear that Mr. Murphy would require continuing job accommodations. Id. ¶¶ 62-63.

3. Count III: Failure to Promote on the Basis of Age
In Count III, Mr. Murphy alleges that the Secretary intentionally and willfully denied Mr. Murphy a promotion to the General Supply Specialist positions and other positions due in part to his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. Id. ¶¶ 66-75.

B. The Secretary's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment: The Parties' Positions
The Secretary moves for judgment as a matter of law that Mr. Murphy's action is limited to events that occurred forty-five days prior to his contact with an EEO counselor on August 23, 2013, in accordance with the timing and administrative exhaustion requirements of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADEA. Def.'s Mot. at 11-13. The Secretary contends that the only allegedly discriminatory conduct that falls within this forty-five day lookback period is the DLA's decision not to promote Mr. Murphy to the General Supply Specialist positions in August 2013. Id. at 14-15. Because the DLA Human Resources Specialist who rejected Mr. Murphy for the General Supply Specialist positions was unaware [*58]  of his deafness or his age at the time she reviewed his application, the Secretary maintains that the Court should further enter summary judgment in the Secretary's favor on Counts I and III. Id. at 17-20. This would leave only Count II—Mr. Murphy's failure to accommodate claim—for trial.
In response, Mr. Murphy argues that the Court should not limit his lawsuit to events that occurred forty-five days prior to his contact with an EEO counselor on August 23, 2013. Pl.'s Opp'n at 7-15. He contends that the forty-five day limitation, although mandatory, is not jurisdictional, and therefore is subject to equitable limitations such as waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling. Id. at 8 (citing Mercado v. Ritz Carlton San Juan Hotel, Spa & Casino, 410 F.3d 41, 50 n.6 (1st Cir. 2005)). In this case, Mr. Murphy argues that the Secretary waived his argument that Mr. Murphy's claims are time barred and that the Court should equitably toll the limitations period to encompass claims outside the forty-five day window. Id. at 8-15.
Mr. Murphy also contends that "[w]ell-settled case law and triable issues of fact . . . prevent summary judgment on the merits of Counts I and III." Id. at 17. He dismisses the Secretary's stated rationale for failing to interview Mr. Murphy—i.e., that Ms. Kendrick relied on an automatically generated score [*59]  without knowing of Mr. Murphy's age or disability—as "pretext." Id. He relies on the so-called "cat's paw" analysis and argues that despite Ms. Kendrick's apparent impartiality, the Secretary may still be liable because Mr. Murphy's supervisors exhibited discriminatory animus by repeatedly ignoring his requests for accommodations and help with the job applications, and because Ms. Kendrick acted as a conduit of their prejudice. Id. at 17-22.
In reply, the Secretary argues that he has not waived his objections to timeliness or otherwise forfeited his ability to challenge Mr. Murphy's claims. Def.'s Reply at 3. Contrary to Mr. Murphy's assertions, the Secretary contends that Mr. Murphy "was afforded every opportunity to clarify the scope of his claims yet failed to do so." Id. at 3-6. Moreover, the Secretary argues that Mr. Murphy failed to meet the "heavy burden of providing the exceptional circumstances necessary for equitable tolling." Id. at 7-10. Additionally, he argues that Mr. Murphy's formal EEO complaint precludes him from asserting decades-spanning claims against the Navy and the DLA because those claims fall beyond the scope of any EEO investigation that could reasonably have grown from his formal EEO complaint. [*60]  Id. at 10.
With respect to the merits of summary judgment on Counts I and III, the Secretary contends that Mr. Murphy improperly characterizes the DLA's purported failures to accommodate as materially adverse employment actions in themselves. Id. at 12-13. According to the Secretary, "[c]laims based on adverse employment action because of an employee's disability are factually and substantively distinct from those involving failures to accommodate." Id. at 13. Finally, the Secretary argues that the "cat's paw" analysis is inapplicable, and that Mr. Murphy has not shown that the DLA's justification for failing to interview Mr. Murphy was pretext. Id. at 13-15.

IV. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). A fact is "material" if it "has the potential to change the outcome of the suit." Tropigas, 637 F.3d at 56 (quoting Borges ex rel. S.M.B.W. v. Serrano-Isern, 605 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2010)). A dispute is "genuine" if "a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party." Id. (quoting McCarthy v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 313, 315 (1st Cir. 1995)).
Once this evidence is supplied by the moving party, the nonmovant must "produce 'specific facts, in suitable evidentiary form, to . . . establish the presence of a trialworthy issue.'" [*61]  Triangle Trading Co., Inc. v. Robroy Indus., Inc., 200 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Morris v. Gov't Dev. Bank of Puerto Rico, 27 F.3d 746, 748 (1st Cir. 1994)). In other words, the non-moving party must "present 'enough competent evidence' to enable a factfinder to decide in its favor on the disputed claims." Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1116 (1st Cir. 1993)). The Court then "views the facts and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party." Ophthalmic Surgeons, Ltd. v. Paychex, Inc., 632 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2011). However, the Court "afford[s] no evidentiary weight to 'conclusory allegations, empty rhetoric, unsupported speculation, or evidence which, in the aggregate, is less than significantly probative.'" Tropigas, 637 F.3d at 56 (quoting Rogan, 267 F.3d at 27); accord Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist., 584 F.3d 314, 325 (1st Cir. 2009).

V. DISCUSSION

A. Forty-Five Day Time Bar
The Secretary argues that procedural constraints imposed under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADEA limit the scope of Mr. Murphy's action to events that occurred forty-five days prior to when Mr. Murphy contacted an EEO counselor on August 23, 2013. Def.'s Mot. at 11-15. The Rehabilitation Act does not establish its own procedures for claims of discrimination brought under Section 501, 29 U.S.C. § 791. See Vazquez-Rivera v. Figueroa, 759 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 2014). Rather, the Act incorporates the procedures set forth in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. See id. Title VII, in turn, authorizes the EEOC to issue rules and regulations to establish applicable procedures and time limits for filing administrative complaints. See id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(b)). [*62]  One such rule is that an employee must contact his or her agency's EEO counselor "within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory . . . ." 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1). The employee must contact an EEO counselor within this limitations period in order to exhaust the employee's administrative remedies. See Velazquez-Rivera v. Danzig, 234 F.3d 790, 794 (1st Cir. 2000). Failure to do so bars the employee from bringing a later court action based on that allegedly discriminatory conduct. See Randall v. Potter, 366 F. Supp. 2d 104, 113 (D. Me. 2005) (citing Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 520 (1st Cir. 1990)).
Turning to the ADEA, federal employees who allege age discrimination in violation of federal law have two enforcement options. See Rossiter v. Potter, 357 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 2004). An employee may file an administrative complaint against the agency and then bring suit in a federal district court if dissatisfied with the administrative outcome. Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 633a(b)-(c)). Alternatively, the employee may bypass the administrative process altogether and file a civil action directly in the federal district court. Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 633a(c)-(d)). When—as here—an employee choses the administrative route, the employee must notify an EEO counselor within forty-five days of the alleged discriminatory conduct. Maziarz v. Brennan, No. 15-cv-30098-MAP, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130619, at *10 (D. Mass. Aug. 3, 2016); 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1).
Hence, in order to exhaust his administrative remedies under both the Rehabilitation Act and the [*63]  ADEA, Mr. Murphy was required to contact a DLA EEO counselor within forty-five days of date "of the matter alleged to be discriminatory. . . ." 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1). In other words, events that occurred more than forty-five days prior to the date that he contacted the EEO counselor are time barred because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to those instances of discrimination. The First Circuit makes clear that "[t]his exhaustion requirement is no small matter; it 'is a condition of the waiver of sovereign immunity' and thus 'must be strictly construed.'" Vazquez-Rivera, 759 F.3d at 47-48 (quoting Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 94, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1990)).
Strong policy considerations undergird the strict application of the forty-five day limitations period. In particular, the limitations period "provid[es] the government an opportunity to conciliate while the complaint is fresh and giv[es] early notice to the employer of possible litigation." Bartlett v. Dep't of the Treasury (I.R.S.), 749 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of Am., 861 F.2d 746, 753 (1st Cir. 1988). By receiving prompt notice of allegedly discriminatory conduct, the government is better able to investigate the allegations and resolve the claim before the parties resort to costly and time-consuming litigation. Furthermore, the longer the complainant waits to file a claim, the more difficult it becomes for the government to defend itself, [*64]  especially as government witnesses move, retire, pass away, or simply forget the underlying circumstances of the case. Hence, to avoid unfairness to the government and to promote the quick resolutions of complaints, courts strictly construe the applicable forty-five day limitations period.
In this case, Mr. Murphy contacted an EEO counselor on August 23, 2013. Thus, pursuant to the forty-five day cut-off period, no events that occurred prior to July 9, 2013 may provide a basis for relief under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADEA. Based on the record, the only allegedly discriminatory conduct that falls within this limitations period was the decision not to interview Mr. Murphy for the General Supply Specialist positions on August 22, 2013.
However, Mr. Murphy explains that the forty-five-day limitations period "is mandatory but not jurisdictional and, like a statute of limitations, is subject to equitable exceptions." Pl.'s Opp'n at 8 (quoting Mercado, 410 F.3d at 50 n.6). He argues that the exceptions of waiver and equitable tolling apply in the present case, and that as a result, he may assert claims that fall outside the forty-five-day cut-off period. Id. at 7-8. The Court addresses the exceptions of waiver and equitable [*65]  tolling in turn.

1. Waiver
Mr. Murphy claims that he "repeatedly made clear throughout the EEO process that he intended to submit a complaint that encompassed significantly more issues than the limited discriminatory action on August 22, 2013 . . . ." Pl.'s Opp'n at 8. Put differently, Mr. Murphy asserts that he intended to complain to the DLA EEO about discrimination that occurred outside the forty-five-day limitations period. Mr. Murphy states that even though "the DLA was on notice of the full extent of Mr. Murphy's claims," the DLA limited its final decision to events that occurred within the forty-five-day period—namely, the August 22, 2013 decision not to interview Mr. Murphy for the General Supply Specialist positions. Id. As such, Mr. Murphy contends that the DLA waived its right to argue that any of his claims are time barred because (a) the DLA was on notice that some of his claims fell outside the forty-five day limitations period and (b) the DLA failed to object to those untimely claims while reaching the merits of Mr. Murphy's timely claims. Id. Both aspects of Mr. Murphy's two-part argument fail because (a) the DLA was not on notice of the full extent of Mr. Murphy's claims [*66]  and (b) the DLA did not reach a decision on the merits of Mr. Murphy's untimely claims.

a. Mr. Murphy Failed to Clarify Claims
First, the record does not reveal that the DLA was actually "on notice of the full extent of Mr. Murphy's claims." Id. Rather, the record reveals that Mr. Murphy largely failed to clarify the extent of his claims despite numerous requests and opportunities to do so. The record indicates that on October 25, 2013, Mr. Murphy filed a pre-complaint with the DLA EEO office. Decl. of A.U.S.A. Andrew K. Lizotte, Attach. 3, EEO Counselor's Rep. at 9 (ECF No. 98) (EEO Counselor's Rep.). In his pre-complaint, Mr. Murphy asserted illegal employment discrimination, including a failure to promote and unequal pay, and a failure to accommodate. Id. at 9-11. With respect to the failure to promote claim, Mr. Murphy stated, "Despite numerous efforts to obtain a promotion over the years, I have never been given one. The most recent example is my application for the position of General Supply Specialist, Vacancy 837027, both GS 7 and 9 in August, 2013." Id. at 9. Mr. Murphy goes on to describe the circumstances surrounding his unsuccessful August 2013 application and his subsequent interactions with the Navy and DLA EEO offices. [*67]  Id. at 9-10. He does not discuss any specific adverse employment actions beyond the August 2013 occurrence. Id. at 9-11. However, at the end of his pre-complaint, Mr. Murphy writes:
4. Timing of the Complaint. One of the obstacles for my filing of a charge of discrimination has been the barriers maintained by the Navy and its EEO Office. I cannot hear and I do not read or write English very well. I am literate only in American Sign Language. Very little if anything in the DOD/Navy/DLA environment is accessible for someone like me.
Id. at 11.
On November 6, 2013, the DLA EEO sent Mr. Murphy's attorney, John Lambert, a "Notice of EEO Rights and Responsibilities" and asked counsel for information regarding "[t]he Job Opportunity Announcement/Vacancy Announcement for which Mr. Murphy was not selected." Id. at 27. On November 20, 2013, Attorney Lambert responded with information "about the August position." Id. at 26. Mr. Murphy's attorney provided no indication that Mr. Murphy's claim encompassed more than the August 2013 decision not to hire Mr. Murphy.
On January 7, 2014, Mr. Murphy and Attorney Lambert signed an "Agreement to Mediate Dispute." Decl. of A.U.S.A. Andrew K. Lizotte, Attach. 2, Agreement to Mediate Dispute—EEO Pre-Compl. (ECF [*68]  No. 98). The agreement contained a description of Mr. Murphy's claims. Id. at 2. In describing the failure to promote claim, the agreement focused exclusively on the August 22, 2013 incident:
Was Mr. Michael Murphy discriminated against based on Age (over 40; month and year not provided) and Disability (Physical: Deaf) when [on] August 22, 2013 he believes the Agency failed to promote him for [the General Supply Specialist positions], and he believes coworkers he has had to train are in a higher wage grade (no dates provided for the occasions he trained coworkers that were of a higher grade).
Was Mr. Murphy discriminated against based on Disability (Physical: Deaf) when he alleges there is a failure to accommodate because of a lack of Deaf friendly culture and despite a[] Deaf [Affinity] group [] in place for Deaf employees, profound changes are still needed (no date(s) provided when he requested accommodations or when they were denied.
Id. There is no evidence that Mr. Murphy or Attorney Lambert disagreed with the description of Mr. Murphy's claims.
On January 23, 2014, the DLA EEO provided Attorney Lambert with an "EEO Counselor's Report." See EEO Counselor's Rep. The report contained a "Precise [*69]  Description of the Claim(s) Mediated," which replicated the description of the claims set forth in the "Agreement to Mediate Dispute" that Mr. Murphy and Attorney Lambert signed on January 7, 2014. Id. at 2-3. Also on January 23, the DLA EEO sent Attorney Lambert a notice of a right to file a formal complaint of discrimination. Decl. of A.U.S.A. Andrew K. Lizotte, Attach. 4, Agreement to Mediate Dispute—EEO Pre-Compl. at 2 (ECF No. 98) (Notice of Right to File). The notice contained instructions for filing, including the requirement that the complaint must:
b. Specifically describe your client's claim or claims . . . (Please Note: Your client's claim must contain only those issues either specifically discussed with your client's EEO Counselor or issues that are like or related to the issues that you discussed with your client's EEO Counselor.)
Id. at 2. The notice provided a list of the "issues specifically discussed with [the] EEO Counselor," which again mirrored the description of the claims in the "Agreement to Mediate Dispute." Id. at 3. Again, there is no evidence that Mr. Murphy or Attorney Lambert objected to the DLA EEO's characterization of Mr. Murphy's claims in either the EEO Counselor's Report or [*70]  the notice.
On February 7, 2014, Mr. Murphy filed his formal complaint, but instead of using the opportunity to correct the DLA EEO's characterization of the claims, Mr. Murphy attached the original October 25, 2013 pre-complaint as the statement of his claim. Stip., Attach. 3, Formal Compl. of Discrimination in the Fed. Gov't at 4-7 (ECF No. 60) (Formal Compl.). On February 21, 2014, the DLA EEO sent Attorney Lambert a letter requesting, among other things, confirmation of its interpretation of Mr. Murphy's claim. Redacted Documents, Attach. 7, Feb. 21, 2014 Letter (ECF No. 102) (Clarification Letter). The DLA EEO once again set forth the same description of Mr. Murphy's complaint that appeared in the "Agreement to Mediate Dispute," the EEO Counselor's Report, and the notice of Mr. Murphy's right to file. Id. at 2. The letter stated, "Please clarify in writing if the above incidents are not correctly defined." Id.
On March 3, 2014, Attorney Lambert responded, "I see little point in going through the time and effort to respond to this information with the mediation coming up. Accordingly, I will plan to respond to your information in the event that mediation is not successful . . . ." Decl. of A.U.S.A. Andrew K. Lizotte, Attach. 6, Mar. 3, 2014 Letter [*71]  (ECF No. 98). On March 14, 2014, after mediation proved unsuccessful, the DLA EEO sent another letter to Attorney Lambert that again included the DLA EEO's description of Mr. Murphy's claims. Redacted Documents, Attach. 8, Mar. 14, 2014 Letter (ECF No. 102). The letter stated:
If you or your client believe the above claim is not correctly defined, please notify me . . . within five calendar days after your receipt of this letter, specifying why you and your client believe the claim is not correctly defined. If you and your client fail to contact me, I will conclude you both agree the claim is properly defined.
Id. at 2. There is no evidence that Mr. Murphy or Attorney Lambert responded to clarify that the failure to promote claim encompassed more than the August 22, 2013 incident.
The DLA's investigation into Mr. Murphy's formal complaint stretched from March 18 to April 24, 2014. Redacted Documents, Attach. 10, Report of Investigation at 2 (ECF No. 102). On May 1, 2014, Mr. Murphy completed a "Declaration Under Penalty of Perjury" that requested further details about the factual circumstances of the case. Murphy EEO Decl. at 1-13. Near the top of the Declaration appeared the same description [*72]  of Mr. Murphy's claims that appeared throughout the pre-complaint and investigatory stages. Id. at 1. Below that description, Mr. Murphy wrote:
Disclaimer.
Mr. Murphy, through Counsel, disputes that the statements above constitute a correct description of his claims. He relies on the responses below to articulate the full scope of his claims.
Id. The Declaration also contained the following question and response:
3. During the period at issue (August 22, 2013), what was your position, series, grade, and geographical location?
A. Actually, August 22, 2013 is not the period at issue necessarily. This complaint has been filed because I have never been promoted or given any other opportunities over the decades I have been here and I have been stuck in the same position and WG 6 since about 1985 while my peers and co-workers have moved on to better situations.
Id. at 2.
On May 27, 2014, the DLA EEO sent Attorney Lambert a copy of the completed Report of Investigation. See Report of Investigation. The Report was based on the DLA EEO's interpretation of Mr. Murphy's claims—namely, that Mr. Murphy only intended to assert a failure to promote claim related to the August 22, 2013 incident. Id. at 2. That same day, the DLA [*73]  EEO contacted Attorney Lambert to notify him of Mr. Murphy's option to elect either a hearing and decision before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) or a final decision directly from the DLA. Decl. of A.U.S.A. Andrew K. Lizotte, Attach. 10, May 27, 2014 Letter at 5-6 (ECF No. 98). By letter dated June 4, 2014, Attorney Lambert "disagree[d]" that the Report of Investigation was complete; however, Attorney Lambert did not specifically dispute the Report's characterization of the claims. Decl. of A.U.S.A. Andrew K. Lizotte, Attach. 10, June 4, 2014 Letter at 3 (ECF No. 98). Nevertheless, Attorney Lambert requested a final DLA decision. Id.
The DLA issued the Final Agency Decision on December 11, 2014. Decl. of Abigail C. Varga, Esq., Ex. B, Final Agency Decision of the DLA in the Discrimination Compl. of Mr. Michael Murphy (ECF No. 80). The decision noted that the DLA "requested clarification of [Mr. Murphy's] claims" and that the DLA "made attempts to obtain clarification of [Mr. Murphy's] claim during the EEO Informal Pre-Complaint stage of the process but was unsuccessful." Id. at 6.
The Court provides this extensive background to demonstrate that the record does not establish—as Mr. Murphy contends—that [*74]  "the DLA was on notice of the full extent of Mr. Murphy's claims . . . ." See Pl.'s Opp'n at 8. The way that Mr. Murphy worded his pre-complaint and subsequent formal complaint strongly suggested that he intended to complain specifically about the August 2013 failure to hire. In particular, he wrote, "Despite numerous efforts to obtain a promotion over the years, I have never been given one. The most recent example is my application for the position of General Supply Specialist, Vacancy 837027, both GS 7 and 9 in August, 2013." EEO Counselor's Rep. at 9. He then went on to describe in detail the circumstances surrounding his unsuccessful August 2013 application without mentioning any other specific adverse employment actions. Id. at 9-11. From this, it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Murphy referred to his failure to receive a promotion "over the years" as a way to place the August 2013 episode in context and not as a way to complain about specific instances of discrimination in the past.
Even assuming that Mr. Murphy did intend to assert decades' worth of employment discrimination in his formal complaint, the EEO process afforded him numerous opportunities to clearly define the extent of his claims. Contrary to Mr. [*75]  Murphy's assertion, the record simply does not show that he "repeatedly made clear throughout the EEO process that he intended to submit a complaint that encompassed significantly more issues than the limited discriminatory action on August 22, 2013." Pl.'s Opp'n at 8. Rather, the record indicates that the DLA repeatedly asked Mr. Murphy if its interpretation of his failure to promote claim was correct. Only once, on May 1, 2013—after the official investigation into Mr. Murphy's claim was complete—did Mr. Murphy call into question the DLA's characterization of his claims. Even then, his qualification was cryptic. See Murphy EEO Decl. at 2 ("Actually, August 22, 2013 is not the period at issue necessarily . . . never promoted . . . over the decades"). It is also significant that Mr. Murphy did not attempt to clarify his claim again on May 27, 2014, when he obtained the Report of Investigation based on the DLA's supposedly flawed characterizations of his claims. Rather, Mr. Murphy opted to move directly to a final decision by the DLA. Given this record, the Court cannot say that "the DLA was on notice of the full extent of Mr. Murphy's claims," much less that the DLA waived any argument [*76]  that Mr. Murphy's claims are time barred.
In sum, the Court finds that throughout the pre-complaint, complaint, and investigatory stages at the administrative level, Mr. Murphy placed the onus on the DLA to interpret the meaning of his claims, while providing minimal effort to clarify his complaint or correct the DLA's interpretations. Mr. Murphy may not now argue that because the DLA interpreted his claims too narrowly, the Secretary is precluded from seeking summary judgment on other claims that Mr. Murphy had in mind. To hold otherwise would be to reward Mr. Murphy for his lack of responsiveness at the administrative level. Accordingly, the Court holds that the Secretary has not waived his objections to timeliness or otherwise forfeited his ability to challenge Mr. Murphy's claims.

b. The DLA Did Not Reach the Merits of Untimely Claims
The Court turns to the second part of Mr. Murphy's waiver argument. Mr. Murphy contends that the DLA's failure to object to his untimely claims—those that arose before July 9, 2013—while reaching the merits of Mr. Murphy's timely claims—the August 22, 2013 failure to promote—bars the DLA from now raising timeliness objections to any of Mr. Murphy's claims. [*77] 67 Id. at 10-11. (citing Formella v. Brennan, 817 F.3d 503, 511 (7th Cir. 2016) (quoting Ester v. Principi, 250 F.3d 1068, 1071-72 (7th Cir. 2001)); Ramirez v. Sec'y, U.S. Dept. of Transp., 686 F.3d 1239, 1252 (11th Cir. 2012).
The cases that Mr. Murphy cites in support of this proposition differ in critical ways from the present situation. In Formella, the Seventh Circuit held that an agency waived a timeliness objection regarding an otherwise untimely claim because the agency reached the merits of the untimely claim in its Final Agency Decision without addressing the timeliness issue. 817 F.3d at 511. In Ester, the agency ruled on the merits of the plaintiff's formal complaint and the plaintiff filed suit in federal district court. 250 F.3d at 1071. The agency then asserted for the first time that the plaintiff did not file his formal complaint with the agency in a timely manner. Id. The Seventh Circuit held that because the agency reached the merits of the complaint, without addressing the question of timeliness, it waived its timeliness defense. Id. at 1071-72.
In Ramirez, the agency dismissed the plaintiff's formal complaint of discrimination as time barred. 686 F.3d at 1246. On appeal, the EEOC reversed and remanded the agency's decision because it found that the plaintiff had no way of knowing about the forty-five-day time bar. Id. The agency did not appeal the ruling or move for reconsideration; instead, it began an investigation into [*78]  the merits of the plaintiff's claims and found that there was no discrimination. Id. The plaintiff brought suit in federal district court, and the agency again raised a timeliness objection. Id. at 1247. The Eleventh Circuit held that because the agency failed to challenge the EEOC finding of timeliness, it waived any subsequent objection on timeliness grounds. Id. at 1252. Thus, in Formella, Ester, and Ramirez, the agencies reached the merits of the untimely claims without raising timeliness objections—or, in the case of Ramirez, challenging the EEOC finding of timeliness. As such, the agencies waived their rights to subsequently raise timeliness objections at the district court.
In this case, however, the DLA did not reach the merits of Mr. Murphy's untimely claims. There was no reason to. The only claims that the DLA investigated and adjudicated were Mr. Murphy's timely claims, including the claim that arose as a result of the August 22, 2013 decision not to promote Mr. Murphy. Because the DLA did not adjudicate the untimely claims, it did not need to object to the untimely claims. Consequently, the DLA has not waived its right to object to Mr. Murphy's current efforts to insert untimely claims into his [*79]  suit against the DLA. See Mercado, 410 F.3d at 45 (holding that an employer did not waive its timeliness defense by failing to raise an objection before the EEOC because the EEOC never reached the merits of the employees' allegedly untimely claims).

2. Equitable Tolling68
Mr. Murphy also urges the Court to equitably toll the forty-five-day time limit because had no notice or other knowledge of the limitations period. Pl.'s Opp'n at 11-15. At the outset, the Court notes the First Circuit's instruction to "interpret the doctrine of equitable tolling quite narrowly, particularly in suits against the government." Farris v. Shinseki, 660 F. 3d 557, 563 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Benitez-Pons v. Com. of Puerto Rico, 136 F.3d 54, 61 (1st Cir. 1998)). It is "[o]nly in exceptional circumstances" that equitable tolling will extend a filing deadline, and the "heavy burden" of "prov[ing] entitlement to equitable relief lies with the complainant." Bartlett, 749 F.3d at 10 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting Irwin, 498 U.S. at 94) (internal quotation marks omitted).
When deciding whether to allow equitable tolling, courts generally weigh five factors: "(1) the lack of actual notice of the filing requirement; (2) lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement; (3) diligence in pursuing one's rights; (4) absence of prejudice to the defendant; and (5) a plaintiff's reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the [filing] [*80]  requirement." Mercado, 410 F. 3d at 48. In Kale v. Combined Insurance Company of America, 861 F.2d 746, 753 (1st Cir. 1988), the First Circuit set out the proper analytical path.69 First, the district court should determine whether the plaintiff had actual or constructive knowledge of his rights under the ADEA or Rehabilitation Act. Bartlett, 749 F.3d at 10 (quoting Kale, 861 F.2d at 753). "Actual knowledge occurs where an employee either learns or is told of his [] rights, even if he becomes only generally aware of the fact that there is a statute outlawing [] discrimination and providing relief therefor." Id. (quoting Kale, 861 F.2d at 753) (alteration added). By contrast, "constructive knowledge . . . is 'attributed' to an employee in situations where he has retained an attorney, or where an employer has fulfilled his statutory duty by conspicuously posting the official EEOC notices that are designed to inform employees of their [] rights." Id. (quoting Kale, 861 F.2d at 753) (alteration added) (citations omitted).
If the court determines that the plaintiff had actual or constructive knowledge of his rights, then "ordinarily there could be no equitable tolling based on excusable ignorance." Id. (quoting Kale, 861 F.2d at 753) (emphasis omitted). However, if the employee has no actual or constructive knowledge of his rights and his ignorance is due to the defendant's [*81]  misleading conduct or the defendant's failure to post the required EEOC notices, then "[t]he court should also assess any countervailing equities against the plaintiff." Kale, 861 F.2d at 753. In particular, the court should ask:
[D]id he diligently pursue his claim, was his ignorance of his rights reasonable under the circumstances, and would allowing equitable tolling still fulfill the basic purposes behind the limited filing period—namely, providing the government an opportunity to conciliate while the complaint is fresh and giving early notice to the employer of possible litigation.
Bartlett, 749 F.3d at 10 (quoting Kale, 861 F.2d at 753). Finally, even if the court finds that the above factors call for equitable tolling, it must then take into account the degree to which the delay prejudices the defendant. Id. at 11 (quoting Kale, 861 F.2d at 753).
Based on the record in this case, the Court concludes that Mr. Murphy had "actual knowledge" of the filing requirements. That is, the record reflects that Mr. Murphy was "generally aware of the fact that there is a statute outlawing [age and disability] discrimination and providing relief therefor." Id. at 10 (quoting Kale, 861 F.2d at 753). In his interrogatory responses, Mr. Murphy states, "I went to the EEO Office because I was told that was the appropriate place to [*82]  assert a discrimination complaint based on my age and disability." Murphy Interrogs. I at 15. Although it is not clear from this interrogatory response exactly when Mr. Murphy was informed that he could go to the EEO to file a complaint, the factual record reveals that as early as 2005, Mr. Murphy approached the Navy EEO to complain about not receiving a promotion on account of his disability. PSAMF ¶¶ 157-59; DRPSAMF ¶¶ 157-59.
In 2006, Mr. Murphy again complained to the EEO about not being promoted. PSAMF ¶ 163; DRPSAMF ¶ 163. Also in 2006, Mr. Murphy obtained legal counsel, who communicated with Shipyard attorneys regarding Mr. Murphy's inability to obtain a promotion. See Murphy Interrogs. I at 6-7; Decl. of A.U.S.A. Andrew K. Lizotte, Attach. 12, December 4, 2006 Letter at 2 (ECF No. 98) (Attorney Wiant Letter). In 2007, Mr. Murphy filed another complaint with the Navy EEO after being passed over for a promotion. Murphy Interrogs. I at 15-16. In connection with that complaint, the EEO sent Mr. Murphy a "Notice of Complainant's Rights and Responsibilities," which Mr. Murphy signed. Decl. of A.U.S.A. Andrew K. Lizotte, Attach. 13, Notice of Complainant's Rights and Responsibilities at 2-9 (ECF No. 98).
Moreover, in 2010, following his transfer [*83]  to the DLA, Mr. Murphy participated in a video conference with a DLA EEO Disability Program Manager translated by an ASL interpreter. DSMF ¶ 17; PRDSMF ¶ 17. During the video conference, Mr. Murphy was notified that the DLA EEO office located in Columbus, Ohio, would provide EEO services to him as a DLA employee, and that if he had any concerns or issues with the DLA, that EEO contacts in the Ohio office would provide him with assistance. DSMF ¶ 18; PRDSMF ¶ 18.
These facts indicate that Mr. Murphy was at least "generally aware" that there were laws prohibiting employment discrimination and providing avenues for relief. Further, the record demonstrates that Mr. Murphy knew to approach the EEO to complain about perceived discrimination, and upon his transfer to the DLA, Mr. Murphy was notified through an ASL interpreter that the DLA EEO would provide service to him.70 As such, the Court concludes that Mr. Murphy possessed "actual knowledge" of his rights under the ADEA and the Rehabilitation Act for purposes of the equitably tolling analysis.
Furthermore, "constructive knowledge" can be attributed to an employee "where an employer has fulfilled his statutory duty by conspicuously [*84]  posting the official EEOC notices that are designed to inform employees of their [] rights." Bartlett, 749 F.3d at 10 (quoting Kale, 861 F.2d at 753). Mr. Murphy does not appear to assert that the DLA failed to post the required DLA notices conspicuously.71 Indeed, Ms. Shepheard testified that the DLA posted the required EEO notices on the official bulletin board in the same building that houses the majority of DLA employees, as well as a cafeteria. Shepheard Dep. at 123:15-22. Rather, Mr. Murphy argues that as a result of his deafness and corresponding inability to read, the postings were not reasonably geared to inform him of the applicable time limits. Pl.'s Opp'n at 73.
The Court is sensitive to Mr. Murphy's concerns. Even a conspicuous EEO notice is of little use to an employee who has limited reading abilities or is unable to fully understand the information contained in the posting. At the same time, the Secretary points out that Mr. Murphy signed a "Notice of Complainant's EEO Rights and Responsibilities" in April 2007 in connection with his previous EEO complaint. Def.'s Reply at 9 n.7. Additionally, other courts have held that an employee's illiteracy or learning [*85]  disability do not justify tolling the limitations period as long as the employer conspicuously posts the required EEO notices. See Everage v. Runyon, 998 F.2d 1016, 1016 (7th Cir. 1993) (unpublished) (affirming the conclusion that the plaintiff's poor reading ability did not justify tolling the time limit where the plaintiff was given constructive notice of the applicable time limits by way of posted notices on bulletin boards at his workplace); Everage v. Frank, No. 90-C-0712, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21585, at *11-12 (E.D. Wis. Jul. 13, 1992); Gessner v. Runyon, Civil Action No. 96-7521, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16642 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 22, 1997) (refusing to grant equitable tolling where agency posted required notices even though employer was "well aware of Plaintiff's learning and mental disabilities"); see also Fisher v. Johnson, 174 F.3d 710, 715 (5th Cir. 1999) (noting that illiteracy and deafness do not support equitable tolling of the AEDPA statute of limitations). As a practical matter, whether an employee actually reads (or is able to read) the notice would seem to be a question of actual, not constructive notice.72
To complicate the question of constructive notice, Mr. Murphy's 2006 consultation with an attorney may well be enough to constitute constructive notice of the filing requirements. Attached to the Secretary's reply to Mr. Murphy's response to the statements of material fact is a copy of a letter dated December 4, 2006, from Attorney Wiant of the Disabilities Rights Center [*86]  of Concord New Hampshire to Scott W. Flood, Assistant Counsel of the Department of the Navy in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, following up on "Michael Murphy's concerns regarding regularly being passed over for promotion." Attorney Wiant Letter at 2. In Cano v. U.S. Postal Serv., 755 F.2d 221 (1st Cir. 1985), the First Circuit wrote that "[s]ince Cano had consulted with an attorney about her employment difficulties just prior to the beginning of the limitations period and subsequently, she could be charged with constructive notice of the relevant Title VII provisions and the procedural requirements of filing an EEO complaint." Id. at 222. "[C]ourts generally impute constructive knowledge of filing and service requirements to plaintiffs who . . . consult with an attorney." Farris, 660 F.3d at 565 (quoting Kelley v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd., 79 F.3d 1238, 1249 (1st Cir. 1996)).
However, the Secretary presented evidence of the 2006 Attorney Wiant letter in support of his qualified response to Mr. Murphy's additional statement of fact paragraph 156, which reads: "Mr. Murphy was never informed of a 45-day time limitation for EEO Complaints during this or any other meeting with or without an ASL interpreter." PSAMF ¶ 156; DRPSAFM ¶ 156. Because it was revealed only in the Secretary's reply, Mr. Murphy has never had an opportunity to respond to the Wiant letter, to [*87]  admit or deny its authenticity, or to explain his view of the letter. Moreover, the Secretary raised the letter only in a footnote in his reply memorandum. Def.'s Reply at 8, n.7. Although it may provide a separate basis for finding constructive notice of the filing requirements, the Court is reluctant to grant summary judgment on the theory of constructive notice based on legal representation since it was not raised in the Secretary's motion and since Mr. Murphy has never had the opportunity to respond to it.73
Nevertheless, the Court concludes that the Secretary has demonstrated that he conspicuously posted the DLA notice, and under Bartlett, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Court concludes that Mr. Murphy "has not carried [his] burden of showing a lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirements." Bartlett, 749 F.3d at 11.
The Court could stop here. See Kale, 861 F.2d at 753 ("If the court determines that the plaintiff had actual or constructive knowledge of his rights, then 'ordinarily there could be no equitable tolling based on excusable ignorance'"). For completeness, the Court briefly addresses one other equitable tolling factor that weighs heavily against Mr. Murphy—namely, prejudice to the Secretary. [*88]  Mr. Murphy's allegations of employment discrimination span multiple decades and two distinct agencies within the Department of Defense. See, e.g., PSAMF ¶ 99 ("Mr. Murphy has never received a promotion in his 37 year tenure at the Shipyard"); PSAMF ¶ 100 ("For over thirty-five (35) years, Mr. Murphy has consistently expressed to his supervisors, co-workers, EEO Specialists, Shipyard counsel, and others, his desire to be promoted); PSAMF ¶ 91 (asserting that Butch Fanjoy—Mr. Murphy's supervisor at the Navy during the 1980's—told him that he would never get promoted).
As discussed previously, the purpose of the limitations period is to "provid[e] the government an opportunity to conciliate while the complaint is fresh" and to "giv[e] early notice to the employer of possible litigation." Bartlett, 749 F.3d at 10 (quoting Kale, 861 F.2d at 753). Permitting Mr. Murphy to assert claims of discrimination stretching back several years would frustrate the purposes of the limitations period and prejudice the Secretary. The Secretary did not have the opportunity to conciliate or investigate these untimely claims when they occurred, and any investigation into the older claims would necessarily be complicated by the fact that many of the individuals in Mr. [*89]  Murphy's prior Navy chain of command have retired or are now deceased. DSMF ¶¶ 8-9; PRDSMF ¶¶ 8-9.74
The Court therefore concludes that the Mr. Murphy has not met his "heavy burden" of proving that he is entitled to equitable tolling. Bartlett, 749 F.3d at 10. The instant case does not present the "exceptional circumstances" necessary to justify extending the filing deadline. Id. Rather, the Court finds that Mr. Murphy had "actual knowledge" of the filing deadline as that term applies in the First Circuit, and that extending the deadline would prejudice the Secretary and run counter to the purposes of the limitations period.

3. 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(2)
Mr. Murphy also attempts to justify extending the limitations period by pointing directly to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(2), which states that "The agency or the Commission shall extend the 45-day time limit . . . when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them . . . ."
In Harris v. Gonzales, 488 F.3d 442, 376 U.S. App. D.C. 289 (D.C. Cir. 2007), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that given subsection (a)(2)'s mandatory language—"the agency . . . shall extend the 45-day time limit"—an agency must grant an extension if the employee [*90]  shows that he "was not notified" or "otherwise aware" of the time limit. Id. at 444. That is, subsection (a)(2) provides an independent basis for extending the time limit that does not need to meet the more demanding common law standard of equitable tolling, which is granted only in "extraordinary and carefully circumscribed circumstances." Id. (quoting Smith-Haynie v. District of Columbia, 155 F.3d 575, 580, 332 U.S. App. D.C. 182 (D.C. Cir. 1998)). Accordingly, courts should extend the time limit unless the employee had actual knowledge of the filing requirement, or else constructive notice—namely, notice that was "reasonably geared to inform the complainant of the time limits." Id. at 445 (quoting Johnson v. Runyon, 47 F.3d 911, 918 (7th Cir. 1995)).75
Although the First Circuit has addressed 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1) on a number of occasions, the parties have cited and the Court has found no First Circuit caselaw interpreting 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(2).76 It is unknown, therefore, whether in light of the strict standard the First Circuit has imposed on equitable tolling, the First Circuit would join the District of Columbia, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits in applying a more lenient standard to the application of § 1614.105(a)(2) than the First Circuit applies to equitable tolling. As those circuits discussed, the language "shall extend" provides a textual justification for viewing § 1614.105(a)(2) as directing more relaxed treatment of the 45-day notice [*91]  provision than general equitable tolling would allow.
Yet even if the Court follows Harris' lead, the Court still concludes that extending the limitations period in this case would be inappropriate. As discussed above, based on this record, the Court finds that Mr. Murphy had "actual notice" of the filing requirement as that term is understood in the First Circuit. To briefly summarize, the record indicates that as early as 2005, Mr. Murphy approached the Navy EEO to complain about not receiving a promotion on account of his disability. PSAMF ¶¶ 157-59; DRPSAMF ¶¶ 157-59. Likewise, in 2006, Mr. Murphy complained to the EEO about not being promoted, PSAMF ¶ 163; DRPSAMF ¶ 163, and obtained outside legal counsel. See Murphy Interrogs. I at 6-7. In 2007, Mr. Murphy filed another complaint with the Navy EEO after being passed over for a promotion and received written notice of his rights and responsibilities in connection with the EEO process. Murphy Interrogs. I at 15-16; Notice of Rights and Responsibilities. In 2010, after transferring to the DLA, Mr. Murphy and an interpreter participated in a video conference with a DLA representative who notified him that the DLA EEO office [*92]  located in Columbus, Ohio, would provide EEO services to him. DSMF ¶¶ 17-18; PRDSMF ¶¶ 17-18. Taken together, these facts indicate that Mr. Murphy was familiar with the EEO process and was aware of the associated administrative procedures. Accordingly, the Court declines to extend the limitations period on the basis of 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(2).

B. Merits of Counts I (Disability Discrimination) and III (Age Discrimination
The Rehabilitation Act prohibits the DLA from discriminating against its employees on the basis of disability. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Likewise, under the ADEA, the DLA must undertake all personnel actions "free from any discrimination based on age." 29 U.S.C. § 633a(a). The parties agree that the Court must test the validity of disability and age discrimination claims under the familiar burden-shifting framework in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).77 See Rios-Jimenez v. Principi, 520 F.3d 31, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2008) (applying the McDonnell Douglas test in the context of the Rehabilitation Act); Bonefont-Igaravidez v. Int'l Shipping Corp., 659 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2011) (applying McDonnell Douglas test in the context of the ADEA).
Under the McDonnell Douglas test, Mr. Murphy must first make out a prima facie case of discrimination. To make out a prima face case of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, Mr. Murphy must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) "[he] was disabled [*93]  within the meaning of the statute"; (2) "[he] was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, either with or without a reasonable accommodation"; and (3) "the employer took adverse action against [him] because of the disability." Rios-Jimenez, 520 F.3d at 41 (citing Bailey v. Georgia-Pac. Corp., 306 F.3d 1162, 1166 (1st Cir. 2002)). The formulation for establishing a prima facie case under the ADEA is only slightly different. The plaintiff must show that: (1) he was at least forty years old; (2) he applied and was qualified for the position; (3) the employer took an adverse employment action against him; and (4) the employer subsequently filled the position. Cameron v. Idearc Media Corp., 685 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 2012) (citing Velez v. Thermo King de P.R., Inc., 585 F.3d 441, 447 n.2 (1st Cir. 2009)).
Once the plaintiff has made a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the DLA to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action. See Rios-Jimenez, 520 F.3d at 41 (disability discrimination); Cameron, 685 F.3d at 48 (age discrimination). Finally, if the DLA meets its burden, the burden shifts back to Mr. Murphy to establish that "the proffered reason is pretext intended to conceal discriminatory intent." Rios-Jimenez, 520 F.3d at 41 (disability discrimination); see also Cameron, 685 F.3d at 48 (age discrimination).

1. Prima Facie Case

a. Disability Discrimination
Mr. Murphy has not made out a prima facie case of disability discrimination. The parties agree that Mr. Murphy's deafness constitutes [*94]  a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. Stip. ¶ 3. Additionally, the record reflects that Mr. Murphy is qualified to perform the functions of a Supply Technician. See PSAMF ¶¶ 96-98; DRPSAMF ¶¶ 96-98. However, there is no evidence in the record that the DLA took adverse action against him "because of the disability." Rios-Jimenez, 520 F.3d at 41.
DLA Human Resources Specialist Lori Kendrick was the DLA contact for the General Supply Specialist positions at the GS-07 and GS-09 levels. DSMF ¶ 48; PRDSMF ¶ 48. In that capacity, she was responsible for reviewing the ranking list automatically generated by the USA Staffing system and determining which applicants to mark for further review and interviews. DSMF ¶ 49; PRDSMF ¶ 49. In August 2013, when Ms. Kendrick reviewed the automated ranking lists for the GS-07 and GS-09 positions and determined that Mr. Murphy's application did not warrant further review, she was not aware of Mr. Murphy's disability. DSMF ¶ 64; PRDSMF ¶ 64. In fact, his application indicated that he did not have a disability; in response to a question that asked whether he was disabled, Mr. Murphy answered "No." DSMF ¶ 58-61; PRDSMF ¶ 58-61. Because Ms. Kendrick was not aware of [*95]  Mr. Murphy's disability at the time she rejected his application, it is patent that the DLA did not take adverse action against him "because of his disability." Therefore, the Court concludes that Mr. Murphy has not made out a prima facie case of disability discrimination.

b. Age Discrimination
The Court also concludes that Mr. Murphy has failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. The factual record demonstrates that Mr. Murphy is at least forty years old, Stip. ¶ 1, that he applied and was qualified for the General Supply Specialist positions, DSMF ¶ 41; PRDSMF ¶ 41; PSAMF ¶ 96-98; DRPSAMF ¶ 96-98, and that the individuals ultimately selected for the General Supply Specialist positions were not disabled and were younger than Mr. Murphy. DSMF 74; PRDSMF ¶ 74. Ordinarily, this would "give[] rise to an inference that the employer discriminated due to the plaintiff's advanced years." Acevedo-Parrilla v. Novartis Ex-Lax, Inc., 696 F.3d 128, 138 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir. 1991)).
However, this inference cannot follow under the circumstances of this case. Ms. Kendrick was unaware of Mr. Murphy's age when she reviewed the applicant ranking list that the USA Staffing system automatically generated. DSMF ¶ 64; PRDSMF ¶ 64; see Harris v. Dow Chem. Co., 586 Fed. Appx. 843, 846 (3rd Cir. 2014) (holding that an inference of [*96]  discriminatory action in the context of the McDonnell Douglass framework "may be raised only if the relevant decision-maker has knowledge of the plaintiff's status as a protected class member"); Geraci v. Moody-Tottrup, Int'l, Inc, 82 F.3d 578, 581 (3rd Cir. 1996) ("[I]t is counter-intuitive to infer that the employer discriminated on the basis of a condition of which it was wholly ignorant, and in this situation the bare McDonnell Douglas presumption no longer makes sense"). Because there is no evidence that Ms. Kendrick was at all aware of Mr. Murphy's age when she made the personnel decisions, the Court concludes that Mr. Murphy has failed to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination under the ADEA.

2. Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reason
Assuming arguendo that Mr. Murphy established a prima facie case for disability and age discrimination, the burden shifts to the Secretary to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action. See Rios-Jimenez, 520 F.3d at 41 (disability discrimination); Cameron, 685 F.3d at 48 (age discrimination). The Court readily concludes that the Secretary has met its burden. First, the facts indicate that Ms. Kendrick did not designate Mr. Murphy's application for further review for the GS-07 position because the answers he submitted to the electronic USA Staffing [*97]  questionnaire automatically generated a score below that necessary to qualify for further review. DSMF ¶¶ 52-55; PRDSMF ¶¶ 52-55. Ms. Kendrick did not review the application materials of any candidate for the GS-07 level whose score fell below the cut-off. DSMF ¶ 54; PRDSMF ¶ 54. Likewise, Ms. Kendrick did not select Mr. Murphy's application for further review for the GS-09 position because his answers to the USA Staffing questionnaire automatically disqualified him from consideration; consequently, his name never appeared on the ranking list that Ms. Kendrick reviewed. DSMF ¶¶ 68-70; PRDSMF ¶¶ 68-70. Furthermore, as discussed above, Ms. Kendrick was not aware of his disability or age at the time she rejected Mr. Murphy's application to the General Supply Specialist positions. DSMF ¶ 64; PRDSMF ¶ 64.
Based on these facts, the Court finds that there was a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Ms. Kendrick's decision not to mark Mr. Murphy's application for further review. Specifically, Ms. Kendrick relied on the ranking lists that the USA Staffing system automatically generated from the applicants' completed questionnaires. The responses that Mr. Murphy submitted to USA Staffing [*98]  did not qualify him for further review, and as such, Ms. Kendrick did not designate his application for additional processing.

3. Pretext
Because the Secretary has offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the decision not to select Mr. Murphy's application for further review, the burden shifts back to Mr. Murphy to prove that "the proffered reason is pretext intended to conceal discriminatory intent." Rios-Jimenez, 520 F.3d at 41. Mr. Murphy presents no evidence that the final decision maker—Ms. Kendrick—had discriminatory intent. Instead, he urges this Court to apply the "cat's paw" theory, under which the Secretary can be liable for discrimination if the discriminatory animus of Mr. Murphy's supervisors tainted Ms. Kendrick's decision. See Harlow v. Potter, 353 F. Supp. 2d 109, 115 (D. Me. 2005). To invoke the cat's paw analysis, Mr. Murphy must establish two conditions: (1) that his supervisors exhibited discriminatory animus and (2) that Ms. Kendrick acted as the conduit of the supervisors' prejudice. See id. (citing Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture, 235 F.3d 219, 227 (5th Cir. 2000)); see also Cariglia v. Hertz Equipment Rental Corp., 363 F.3d 77 (1st Cir. 2004). That is, an employer may be held liable if the final decision maker merely acted as a rubber stamp, or "the cat's paw," of others who were acting from discriminatory motives and who possessed leverage, or exerted influence over [*99]  the "titular decisionmaker." Id. at 117 (citing Russell, 235 F.3d at 227).
Mr. Murphy argues that his supervisors and disability program representatives repeatedly failed to respond to his requests for help and training on the USA Staffing website. Pl.'s Opp'n at 20. He asserts that "[b]ecause Mr. Murphy was not provided accommodations, much less even assistance, in his attempts to apply for promotions, his job application was inaccurate." Id. at 20-21. In other words, Mr. Murphy contends that his supervisors exhibited discriminatory animus by failing to help Mr. Murphy with the USA Staffing website, and therefore Ms. Kendrick acted as a conduit of the supervisors' prejudice when she rejected his inaccurate application.
The Court concludes that the "cat's paw" analysis is inapplicable in the present case because Mr. Murphy's supervisor's involvement in Ms. Kendrick's decision was too attenuated. The cases that apply the "cat's paw" analysis—including all of the cases that Mr. Murphy cites—involve biased individuals who engaged in conduct that directly manipulated the information that an impartial final decision maker relied upon to come to a decision. See Staub v. Proctor Hosp., 562 U.S. 411, 421, 131 S. Ct. 1186, 179 L. Ed. 2d 144 (noting that "any case of cat's paw liability" requires reliance on "facts provided [*100]  by the biased supervisor"). Thus, in Cariglia, the First Circuit applied the "cat's paw" analysis where an employee argued that a supervisor, who harbored discriminatory age-based animus against him, withheld exculpatory evidence from decision makers and thereby the supervisor's "animus impermissibly tainted the decisionmaking process." 363 F.3d at 83.
Consistent with Cariglila, in Harlow, this Court applied the "cat's paw" analysis where an allegedly discriminatory supervisor who suspected an employee of falsifying time reports submitted a biased report to the acting plant manager, who in turn forwarded the information to a labor specialist. 353 F. Supp. 2d. at 112. The labor specialist relied on the biased information provided directly by the employee's supervisor and recommended dismissing the employee. Id. at 112.
Similarly, in Cote v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 168 F. Supp. 3d 313 (D. Me. 2016), this Court applied the "cat's paw" analysis where an allegedly discriminatory supervisor provided misleading information directly to an unbiased decision maker who in turn fired the employee. Id. at 336-37.
In these cases, the supervisor whom the employee accused of discriminatory animus directly provided misleading information to or withheld exculpatory information from the unbiased decision maker. This direct involvement [*101]  in the decision making process raises the possibility that the supervisors' discrimination tainted the supposedly unbiased decision. Yet here, there is no evidence that Mr. Murphy's supervisors communicated with Ms. Kendrick whatsoever. Nor is there any indication that any of Mr. Murphy's supervisors meddled with the information that Ms. Kendrick used to arrive at her decision not to designate Mr. Murphy's application for further review. As such, Ms. Kendrick did not act as anyone's "cat's paw"; rather, she relied solely on the information that Mr. Murphy himself submitted on the USA Staffing questionnaire.
The Court is sympathetic to Mr. Murphy's assertion that he never received accommodation or training on how to navigate the USA Staffing website, and the Court appreciates that it could be very difficult to navigate the online system with minimal English skills. Yet these concerns are applicable to Mr. Murphy's claim that the Secretary failed to provide reasonable accommodations. Notably, the Secretary has not moved for summary judgment on this count, and thus Mr. Murphy will be able to press his argument that the DLA's failure to accommodate him on the USA Jobs website led to his [*102]  failure to receive a promotion.
In sum, because Ms. Kendrick was not aware of Mr. Murphy's age or disability at the time she made the decision not to select Mr. Murphy's application for further review, and because Mr. Murphy's supervisors were not directly responsible for providing Ms. Kendrick with misleading information relating to Mr. Murphy's application, the Court concludes that the Secretary is entitled to summary judgment on Counts I and III of Mr. Murphy's complaint.
