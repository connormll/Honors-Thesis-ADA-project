MEMORANDUM ORDER
Ethan C. Brown brought this action against his former employer Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. ("Martin Marietta") for alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), and a jury trial commenced on August 23, 2021. At the conclusion of Brown's evidence, Martin Marietta moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Because Brown did not provide sufficient evidence to support his claim, the motion is granted.
A court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law "[i]f a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue". Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). Viewing the evidence and making reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, "[a] district court should grant judgment as a matter of law 'if the nonmoving party failed [*2]  to make a showing on an essential element of his case with respect to which he had the burden of proof.'" McKiver v. Murphy-Brown, LLC, 980 F.3d 937, 965 (4th Cir. 2020) (quoting Russell v. Absolute Collection Servs., Inc., 763 F.3d 385, 391, 392 (4th Cir. 2014)); see also Gairola v. Va. Dep't of Gen. Servs., 753 F.2d 1281, 1285 (4th Cir. 1985) (explaining that a motion for directed verdict should be granted "when any verdict in favor of the nonmoving party necessarily will be premised upon 'speculation and conjecture'").
Brown, who has epilepsy, suffered a seizure at home on December 24, 2016. (Trial Tr. Day 2 152:22-153:8, 155:7-11 [Doc. #102].) At the time, he was employed as a Truck Driver — Heavy Off Highway1 for Martin Marietta at its Woodleaf quarry but also traveled to several of the company's other quarries. (Trial Tr. Day 1 51:11-53:3 [Doc. #101].) As a result of his seizure, Brown's physician restricted him from driving until June 24, 20172 , six months past his seizure. (Trial Tr. Day 1 54:24-56:11; Pl.'s Ex. 28.) After Brown's FMLA leave expired on March 21, 2017, he was terminated. (Trial Tr. Day 1 63:14-18, 66:5-8; Pl.'s Ex. 8.) At trial, he alleged that Martin Marietta violated the ADA when it failed to offer reasonable accommodation for his disability such as extending his leave or reassigning him to a vacant position and failed to participate in good faith in the interactive process [*3]  to identify a reasonable accommodation.
Under the ADA, a covered employer is prohibited from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability". 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). A "qualified individual" is defined as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). As is relevant here, discrimination not only includes termination, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a), but also the failure to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee", 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
A reasonable accommodation is a "[m]odification[] or adjustment[] to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held . . . is customarily performed, that enable[s] an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position". 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii)3 . Reasonable accommodations may include job restructuring, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B), by "reallocating or redistributing nonessential, marginal job functions", 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o) App.; reassignment to a vacant position4 , 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); or "the use of accrued paid leave or prov[ision] [of] additional unpaid leave for necessary [*4]  treatment", 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o) App. "To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation" that "identif[ies] the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). "A reasonable accommodation is one that is feasible or plausible." Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cty., 789 F.3d 407, 414 (4th Cir. 2015) (citing U.S. Airways v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 402 (2002), 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589).
To prove that Martin Marietta failed to accommodate him in violation of the ADA, Brown had to show "(1) that he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that [Martin Marietta] had notice of his disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the position . . .; and (4) that [Martin Marietta] refused to make such accommodations", Wilson v. Dollar General Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal quotations omitted) (alterations in original). At issue for the jury were the last two elements.
As for leave as a reasonable accommodation, Brown's physician restricted him from driving from December 24, [*5]  2016 to June 24, 2017, (see, e,g., Pl.'s Ex. 28), and he was on FMLA leave until March 21, 2017, (Pl.'s Ex. 8). Viewing the evidence and making reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Brown, any leave for the remainder of his driving restriction at the expiration of his FMLA leave would have been finite. However, there is insufficient evidence that the three months of leave would have been reasonable or, in other words, feasible or plausible. The only evidence of the feasibility or plausibility of the leave is the Reasonable Accommodation Analysis completed by HR Safety Manager Kirk Grissett who did not testify at trial. (See Trial Tr. Day 2 98:11-12 (identifying Grissett as the HR Safety Manager).) As instructed by company policy and the accommodation analysis, on February 20, 2017 Grissett considered whether leave was a reasonable accommodation and answered "No". (Pl.'s Ex. 17 (Accommodating Employee and Applicant Work Restrictions); Pl.'s Ex. 18 (Reasonable Accommodation Analysis).) The accommodation analysis asked if the accommodation "burden[ed] . . . co-workers, create[d] a financial burden on the facility or the Company, or otherwise change[d] an essential function [*6]  of operations at [the] location". Grissett answered "Yes" and explained that "[t]he location has to have all haul trucks running to meet production needs." (Pl.'s Ex. 18.) To do so, it is reasonable to infer that, for three months, other employees would have to have been brought in to drive Brown's truck and other employees would have to have been paid overtime to cover his absence. In response to Martin Marietta's motion for judgment as a matter of law, Brown's counsel argued, "[W]e haven't had a chance to talk to Mr. Grissett about this", (Trial Tr. Day 2 181:20-182:1), but he chose not to call Grissett as a witness, apparently also not having deposed him earlier, (Trial Tr. Day 2 182:2-12). Because Brown did not provide evidence that leave was reasonable, the question of whether Martin Marietta should have provided leave as an accommodation need not go to the jury.
As for reassignment to a vacant position as a reasonable accommodation, there was testimony that Brown had experience at Martin Marietta welding, working as a weighmaster, doing repairs, and working as a mechanic, among other things, in addition to driving trucks. (Trial Tr. Day 1 31:14-34:2, 42:15-43:5; Trial Tr. Day [*7]  2 54:22-55:6, 62:16-63:14.) There was testimony that employees filled in for each other when they were out and that Brown was willing to do so. (Trial Tr. Day 1 33:19-24, 59:5-8; Trial Tr. Day 2 15:5-15, 65:13-15.) But, "identifying specific, isolated tasks he could have performed despite his physician's restrictions is not sufficient", Fields v. Clifton T. Perkins Hosp., No. RDB-12-3254, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83482, 2014 WL 2802986, at *5 (D. Md. June 19, 2014), aff'd, 605 F. App'x 200 (4th Cir. June 3, 2015), and Martin Marietta was not required to create a new position, Perdue v. Sanofi-Aventis U.S., LLC, 999 F.3d 954, 960 (4th Cir. 2021) (citing Laird v. Fairfax Cty., 978 F.3d 887, 892 n.3 (4th Cir. 2020)). There was also testimony that there may have been vacant positions. (Trial Tr. Day 2 64:8-15, 66:15-67:4, 68:1-4 (Hogue testifying that the Kannapolis facility "was always needing men"; a woman was hired as a weighmaster at the Kannapolis facility in 2017; several employees retired or stopped working in the first part of 2017).)
But, there was no evidence of a specific vacancy between January 2017 and March 21, 2017, the period about which Brown's counsel examined witnesses, for which Brown was qualified. (Trial Tr. Day 1 81:4-82:6 (Brown testifying that he looked online while out on FMLA leave to see if Martin Marietta had any vacancies nearby but he never found anything he could have taken); Trial Tr. Day 2 66:11-67:7, 68:1-13 (Hogue testifying that he did not know [*8]  of a specific vacancy at Kannapolis that did not require driving, did not know when in 2017 the woman was hired as the weighmaster at Kannapolis, and did not identify from which positions employees retired or stopped working, whether Brown was qualified for them, or when during the first part of 2017 they were available); 135:12-14, 136:7-138:3 (Kerns testifying she did not know how many positions were available in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, or how many vacancies there were between January and March 21, 2017 at the quarries within fifty miles of Woodleaf5 , or whether they were non-driving positions); 57:16-20 (Robertson testifying he did not know the dates of any job openings). Even Brown's counsel admitted that Brown had not presented evidence that specifically identified a vacant position. (Trial Tr. Day 2 174:16-17.)
However, he argued that "[t]he reason we don't have any information about available positions is because Defendants failed to engage in the interactive process that they are required to engage in." (Trial Tr. Day 2 174:24-175:1.) Courts recognize that an employer is often in a better position to know of vacancies and that the employee may be unaware [*9]  of open positions at the time he needs an accommodation. See, e.g., Wehner v. Best Buy Stores, L.P., No. MJG-15-2163, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34349, 2017 WL 952685, at *11 (D. Md. Mar. 10, 2017). This is among the reasons that an employer has "a good-faith duty 'to engage in the interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation.'" Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Cts., 780 F.3d 562, 581 (4th Cir. 2015) (citing Wilson, 717 F.3d at 346). And, during the pendency of this action, Brown had the opportunity to discover what specific vacant positions for which he was qualified were available during the relevant period, so that at trial he could present the requisite evidence of an actual position to which he could have been reassigned. See Wehner, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34349, 2017 WL 952685, at *12. This Brown concedes he did not do. Because Brown presented no evidence of any reasonable accommodation that Martin Marietta could have offered him, it matters not the extent to which Martin Marietta engaged with him. In other words, Martin Marietta cannot be liable for any alleged failure to participate in good faith in the interactive process because the evidence failed to show there were any reasonable accommodations that could have been identified. See Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 581 (citing Wilson, 717 F.3d at 347). On the evidence, no reasonable juror could find in favor of Brown in this action.
For the reasons explained in this Memorandum, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.'s motion for [*10]  judgment as a matter of law is GRANTED and that this action is DISMISSED. A Judgment dismissing this action will be entered contemporaneously with this Memorandum Order.
