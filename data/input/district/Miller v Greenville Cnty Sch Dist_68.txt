Opinion



ORDER
This matter is before the court on the defendants' motion for summary judgment (doc. 199). In her second amended complaint, the plaintiff, who is proceeding pro se, alleges disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, religious and national origin discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and state law claims for civil conspiracy, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, tortious interference with contract/breach of contract/wrongful discharge, negligent supervision, and abuse of process (doc. 31, 2nd amended comp. pp. 95-96).1
As the plaintiff alleges employment discrimination claims, the case [*2]  was originally referred to the undersigned for pretrial handling pursuant to the provisions of Title 28, United States Code, Section 636(b)(1)(A), and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g) DSC. On May 22, 2012, the parties consented to have a United States Magistrate Judge conduct all proceedings in this case including trial, the entry of final judgment, and all post-trial proceedings (doc. 58). Accordingly, the case was referred to the undersigned for disposition on May 29, 2012, pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, Section 636(c), and Local Civil Rule 73.01(B) DSC, upon consent of the parties and by order of the Honorable Henry M. Herlong, Jr, Senior United States District Judge (doc. 67).
The defendants filed their motion for summary judgment on March 27, 2013. On March 28, 2013, an order was issued pursuant to Roseboro v. Garrison, 528 F.2d 309 (4th Cir. 1975) advising the plaintiff of the motion for summary judgment procedure and the possible consequences if she failed to adequately respond to the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff's response to the motion for summary judgment was due on May 2, 2013. On April 11, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion for clarification/extension of the response date to the motion for summary judgment (doc. 214). On April 29, 2013, the court granted the motion and gave the plaintiff until May 7, 2013, to file her response (doc. [*3]  221). On May 6, 2013, the plaintiff filed a second motion for extension of time to file her response to the summary judgment motion with consent of the defendants because of an injured wrist (doc. 225). The defendants agreed to her request of a six week extension. On the same day, the court granted this motion, stating that "the plaintiff's complete response to the motion for summary judgment must be received by the Clerk of Court on or before June 18, 2013" (doc. 227). The order stated that no further extensions of time to respond to the motion for summary judgment would be granted.
On the morning of June 18, 2013, the plaintiff called the Clerk's Office to request a third extension of time. This oral request was denied, and at 4:40 p.m., the plaintiff arrived at the Clerk's Office to file her response to the motion for summary judgment2 (doc. 230). The plaintiff's response to the motion for summary judgment consists of an affidavit attesting to the veracity of her previous filings, several compact discs, and over 800 pages of documents, most of which include the plaintiff's handwritten notes and arguments in the margins3 (see id.). The plaintiff filed no memorandum citing to particular [*4]  material in the record and no descriptive documentation nor index with her voluminous documents, and her affidavit does not address the factual allegations in this case (see id.).

FACTS PRESENTED
The plaintiff was interviewed and hired by the principal of Travelers Rest High School ("TRHS"), defendant Louis E. Lavely, Jr., in the summer of 2007 (doc. 199-2, Lavely aff. ¶ 3; doc. 199-3, pl. dep. 56-69). She was hired as an art teacher at TRHS pursuant to an annual contract under South Carolina Code Annotated Section 59-26-40 (Lavely aff. ¶¶ 3-4).
The plaintiff alleges that "within 20 minutes of receiving [her] students on the first day [as a teacher at TRHS] . . . [she] heard loud whispers - Jew, Christ killer, Satan, the devil - looking right at [her]" (pl. dep. 160-61). The plaintiff alleges that she told Tim Brown and Assistant Principal Larry Ertzberger about [*6]  what she heard the students say (id. 162). Also, in the fall of 2007, the plaintiff found a student's drawing of a swastika on a piece of paper on her desk (id. 167). According to the plaintiff, she immediately told defendant Lavely about it (id. 168). At the beginning of the 2007-08 school year, the plaintiff complained to defendant Lavely about a school assembly in which a Christian minister was invited to speak and they "all had to pray for Our Lord Jesus Christ" (id. 171-74). The plaintiff also states that she complained regarding a school concert in December 2007 that included the songs "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," "Kings of Orient," and "Oh Come, Oh Come, Emmanuel" (id. 176; see doc. 31-2 at p. 36).
Upon the conclusion of the 2007-08 school year, defendant Lavely recommended that the plaintiff be hired pursuant to a second annual contract for the 2008-09 school year, during which she was scheduled for evaluation in accordance with the statute (id. ¶ 4). See S.C. Code Ann. § 59-26-40(D), (E).4
Early in the 2008-09 school year, defendant Lavely noticed that the plaintiff was habitually late for work (Lavely aff. ¶ 5). According to defendant Lavely's affidavit, all teachers at the school were expected to arrive at school by 8:15 a.m. unless otherwise excused, and prompt arrival was an essential function of the job for reasons of safety, student supervision, and efficient use of class [*8]  time (id.). The plaintiff concedes that she was "constantly just a few minutes late" for work in the 2007-08 school year (pl. dep. 132-39). The plaintiff testified that she was not late for her classes and she "stayed many hours late" (id. 132). After defendant Lavely wrote a memo to the plaintiff's file regarding tardiness, the plaintiff requested that she be allowed to arrive "5 to 8 minutes late" without consequence as an accommodation of her Attention Deficit Disorder ("ADD") (Lavely aff. ¶ 6). On August 22, 2008, the plaintiff's request was denied on the grounds that prompt arrival at school to start the work day was an essential function of her job that could not be altered for her benefit. The plaintiff did not provide any medical documentation to support her request (id. & ex. C).
During the 2008-09 school year, a three member formal evaluation team composed of a District-level evaluator (Brana Myers), the Principal (defendant Lavely) and a content-area specialist (Dianne McGee) assessed the plaintiff's job performance using the defendant School District's Performance Assessment for Teachers ("PAS-T") criteria used for evaluating all teachers (Lavely aff. ¶ 7 & ex. D). The evaluation [*9]  team noted concerns with the plaintiff's performance in her preliminary evaluation in December 2008. Specifically, she received "not evident" ratings in PS3 (Instructional Delivery) and PS5 (Learning Environment) (id.). A statement in her evaluation notes that "a climate of mutual trust and respect is not evident" in the plaintiff's classroom (id.). In emails, the plaintiff accused her evaluators of bias and lack of transparency (id. ¶ 8 & ex. E).
By memorandum dated February 5, 2009, defendant Lavely advised the plaintiff that, due to the need to complete her current PAS-T evaluation, he was deferring until March 13th his decision on whether to recommend her re-employment for the 2009-10 school year (Lavely aff. ¶ 9 & ex. F).
On February 20, 2009, the plaintiff met with defendant Lavely regarding incidents that occurred in her classroom on February 18, 2009. At the plaintiff's request, Assistant Principal Larry Ertzberger and School Resource Officer Scott White also attended the meeting. Additionally, Assistant Principal Greg Wynder was present. The incidents included the plaintiff accidentally splashing paint on a student's clothing and becoming involved in a confrontation with the [*10]  student. She also confronted a second student telling the student, "Keep your mouth closed" and "I am tired of you talking back to me, cut it out!" The plaintiff also slept through portions of her second block planning time (Lavely aff. ¶¶ 10-11 & ex. G). During the meeting with defendant Lavely, the plaintiff attributed her conduct to accidentally switching her personal medication (id.; see also doc. 199-2 at p. 52, doc. 230-4 at p. 116). Defendant Lavely summarized his concerns in a letter to the plaintiff dated February 23, 2009 (Lavely aff., ex. G). Defendant Lavely stated that "[a]n immediate and sustained improvement in [the plaintiff's] performance [was] required" and that "[f]ailure to do so [would] result in [his] recommendation to the superintendent for [the plaintiff's] separation of employment from Greenville County Schools" (id.).
Subsequently, defendant Lavely requested that the plaintiff provide her teaching portfolio to members of the evaluation team for review (Lavely aff. ¶¶ 12-13). The plaintiff refused to provide defendant Lavely with the portfolio after repeated requests and accused defendant Lavely of attempting to tamper with her portfolio (id. & ex. H). Patty Fox, the School [*11]  District's Coordinator for Mentoring and Evaluation, explained to the plaintiff the need to provide defendant Lavely with her portfolio and to allow him to observe her class (id. ¶ 13 & ex. H). The plaintiff admits that she accused defendant Lavely and Ms. Fox of "falsehoods," untruths, bullying, and manipulation (pl. dep. 182-86). Ms. Fox met with the plaintiff on March 5, 2009, regarding the plaintiff's refusal to release her portfolio to defendant Lavely and the plaintiff's request that an Assistant Principal join defendant Lavely when he conducted his observation of the plaintiff (id., ex. H at p. 51). Ms. Fox advised the plaintiff that defendant Lavely was capable of conducting a teacher observation and he would not need to have someone sit in with him. However, Ms. Fox agreed to add an additional observer to the plaintiff's evaluation team. The plaintiff accused Ms. Fox of being untruthful. In her summary of the meeting, Ms. Fox noted that after talking for 30 minutes she felt that she was not making any headway with the plaintiff, and the plaintiff "was becoming irate and continued to raise her voice and interrupt [her] as [she] was trying to make [her] point" (id., ex. H at pp. 54-55).
Defendant Lavely [*12]  placed the plaintiff on administrative leave on March 9, 2009 (Lavely aff. ¶¶ 13-14 & ex. I). In a letter dated March 18, 2009, to Dr. Phinnize J. Fisher, who was then Superintendent of the School District, defendant Lavely recommended that the plaintiff's employment be terminated immediately for the reasons set forth below:
• persistent requests (unsupported by a physician's statement) to be late to work due to Attention Deficit Disorder, which were denied as reporting to work on time is an essential job responsibility for a teacher;
• requests for several changes in the PAS-T procedure without valid reason;
• inability to establish a climate of trust and cooperation in her classroom as highlighted by the February 18, 2009, incidents;
• persistent unprofessional verbal and email communications with her supervisors, parents of students, and her evaluation team; and
• repeated insubordination in failing to meet with defendant Lavely to discuss her requests to meet with parents and provide him with her teaching portfolio.
(Id., ex. I). By letter dated March 25, 2009, Dr. Fisher advised the plaintiff that the Board of Trustees accepted her recommendation that the plaintiff's employment be terminated, [*13]  subject to the plaintiff's right to request an informal hearing before her (id., ex. J). Dr. Fisher noted that the plaintiff's employment was being terminated because she "failed to establish a climate of mutual trust and respect in [her] classroom." Specifically, Dr. Fisher noted the incidents of February 18, 2009, and that the students involved walked out of the plaintiff's class and reported that they felt threatened and unsafe. Dr. Fisher also noted that the plaintiff later called a parent of one of the students and accused the students of conspiring against her. Dr. Fisher further cited the plaintiff's "numerous unprofessional, accusatory, and inflammatory statements in written and oral communications with Mr. Lavely, members of [her] PAS-T evaluation team, and other District employees" and the plaintiff's repeated refusals to provide her PAS-T portfolio to defendant Lavely so that he could complete the plaintiff's spring PAS-T observation (id.).
The plaintiff requested a grievance hearing with Dr. Fisher, who conducted the hearing on May 15, 2009 (Lavely aff. ¶ 16). Dr. Fisher heard from defendant Lavely and the plaintiff, and upheld the termination decision for the reasons stated [*14]  in her letter of May 20, 2009 (id., ex. K). The plaintiff further appealed Dr. Fisher's decision to the Board of Trustees, which declined in its discretion to hear her grievance (doc. 230-1 at p. 20).
The plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the South Carolina Human Affairs Commission on or about January 15, 2010 (pl. dep., ex. 1). The plaintiff applied for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration and began receiving disability benefits in approximately February 2011 (id. 105-10).

APPLICABLE LAW AND ANALYSIS
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 states, as to a party who has moved for summary judgment: "The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). As to the first of these determinations, a fact is deemed "material" if proof of its existence or nonexistence would affect the disposition of the case under the applicable law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue of material fact is "genuine" if the evidence offered is such that a reasonable jury might return a verdict for the non-movant. Id. at 257. In determining whether a genuine issue has been raised, the court must construe all inferences and ambiguities against [*15]  the movant and in favor of the non-moving party. United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962).
The party seeking summary judgment shoulders the initial burden of demonstrating to the district court that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the movant has made this threshold demonstration, the non-moving party, to survive the motion for summary judgment, may not rest on the allegations averred in his pleadings; rather, he must demonstrate that specific, material facts exist that give rise to a genuine issue. Id. at 324. "A party asserting that a fact . . . is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by . . . citing to particular parts of materials in the record . . . or showing that materials cited do not establish the absence . . . of a genuine dispute . . . ." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Under this standard, the existence of a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position is insufficient to withstand the summary judgment motion. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. Likewise, conclusory allegations or denials, without more, are insufficient to preclude the granting of the summary judgment motion. Ross v. Communications Satellite Corp., 759 F.2d 355, 365 (4th Cir. 1985), overruled on other grounds by 490 U.S. 228, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1989). "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary [*16]  judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has cautioned that pro se filings are to be held to less stringent standards than the formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. Butler v. Cooper, 554 F.2d 645, 647 (4th Cir.1977). Nonetheless "[t]he 'special judicial solicitude' with which a district court should review such pro se [pleadings] does not transform the court into an advocate. Only those questions which are squarely presented to a court may properly be addressed." Weller v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 901 F.2d 387, 391 (4th Cir.1990).

Disability Discrimination
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA5, the plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) she is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) she was discharged; (3) she was performing the job at a level that met her employer's legitimate expectations at the time of her discharge; and (4) that her discharge occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., 252 F.3d 696, 702 (4th Cir. 2001).
The McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) scheme of proof applies to claims under the ADA. Ennis v. National Ass'n of Business and Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 58 (4th Cir. 1995). Accordingly, [T]he [*17]  plaintiff has the initial burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. If the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation which, if believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action. If the defendant meets this burden of production, the presumption created by the prima facie case "drops out of the picture," and the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of proving that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination. Id. (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)).
In other words, if the defendant meets the burden to demonstrate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff's discharge, the plaintiff must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reason was " 'not its true reason[ ], but [was] a pretext for discrimination.' " Merritt v. Old Dominion Freight, 601 F.3d 289, 294 (4th Cir. 2010) (Title VII case) (quoting Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). Accordingly, the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating pretext "'merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that [the plaintiff] has been the victim of intentional discrimination.'" Id. (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256) (alterations in original). To meet this "merged" burden, the employee may prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision maker's affidavit is untrue or that the employer's proffered explanation is "unworthy of credence." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256. "[A] plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). However, "if the record conclusively reveal[s] some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if the plaintiff create[s] only [*18]  a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred," summary judgment is appropriate. Id. Accordingly, the court must evaluate "the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law." Id. at 148-49. "Notwithstanding the intricacies of proof schemes, the core of every [discrimination] case remains the same, necessitating resolution of the ultimate question of ... whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination." Merritt, 601 F.3d at 294-95.
Assuming for purposes of this motion that the plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability6, the plaintiff has failed to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the third and fourth elements of her prima facie case, that she was performing her job at a level that met her employer's legitimate expectations at the time of her discharge and that her discharge occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful [*19]  discrimination. Specifically, the plaintiff's three-person evaluation team concluded that her teaching failed to meet acceptable performance standards in two of eight criteria. The preliminary evaluation, coupled with the plaintiff's unacceptable conduct toward students in her class and her supervisors, as well as her refusal to provide her portfolio to defendant Lavely, demonstrate that the plaintiff was not performing the job at a level that met her employer's legitimate expectations at the time of her discharge. Moreover, to the extent that the plaintiff contends that her alleged mental or emotional impairments caused her behavior, the defendants have no obligation under the ADA to overlook or accommodate rude behavior or insubordination. See Kiel v. Select Artificials, Inc., 169 F.3d 1131, 1136 (8th Cir.1999) ("[T]he ADA confers no right to be rude"); Halperin v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Sciences, 669 F.3d 454, 465 (4th Cir. 2012) (applying Title III of the ADA and holding that misconduct or unprofessional behavior, whether related to disability or not, may be the basis for dismissal from a covered program).
The plaintiff argues [*21]  that emails between defendant Lavely and Pat Mitchell, the defendant School District's Director of Human Resources, show that they "were intent and well-motivated and working in collusion to try to get [her] fired way before the so-called 'insubordinate' event of 03/06/09. They discuss (in writing) how best to write [her] disciplinary letter, and whether or not [she is] 'speaking to resigning' (as opposed to being fired)" (doc. 230-1 at pp. 7-10) (emphasis in original). The plaintiff states that these emails are located in a "Bates file provided by the Defense"; however, after a review of the documents submitted by the defendants and the plaintiff, the undersigned has been unable to locate the referenced emails in the record.
The plaintiff further argues that defendant Lavely's animus towards her and disparate treatment of her are reflected in the "numerous falsehoods (negative) in his evaluation . . ., his silencing of me & prohibiting me from associating with the TRHS community (as referenced in the supporting materials herein, such as voice mails to me from Mr. Lavely's secretary, Mary Beth Bowers, and emails from Mary Beth Bowers . . . .)" (doc. 230-1 at pp. 12-13). The court has [*22]  listened to the voice mails referenced by the plaintiff, which she submitted on a compact disc. In those voice mails, Ms. Bowers asked that the plaintiff call to set up a time to pick up the rest of her belongings at the school and told the plaintiff that defendant Lavely's requirements were that the plaintiff could not bring a student or student's parent with her, she would need to come after school hours, and defendant Lavely would need to be present.
The plaintiff also cites "the kiln issue" as "very reflective of Mr. Lavely's animus toward me and disparate treatment (at times) and the disparate impact (at other times)" (doc. 230-9 at pp. 43-45). The plaintiff contends that she needed the kiln for her crafts classes, and defendant Lavely promised to have the kiln repaired (doc. 230-1 at p. 16). However, "for almost a year . . . the kiln remained damaged and it impacted [her] curriculum and the students' work. The issue became a 'hot spot' between Mr. Lavely and [the plaintiff]." According to the plaintiff, in mid to late January 2009, she went to the school PTSA President for funds for the kiln repair, and two to three weeks later, defendant Lavely sent her a letter "deferring" her [*23]  contract, and two months later, she was placed on administrative leave (id. at pp. 16-17;see doc. 230-9 at pp. 43-51, 57-65).
While the evidence shows that the plaintiff and defendant Lavely had a history of disagreements, the evidence discussed above fails to show that the plaintiff was performing her job at a level that met her employer's legitimate expectations at the time of her discharge or that her discharge occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. Furthermore, the defendants' have articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating the plaintiff's employment, and the plaintiff has failed to show that such reasons were pretext for discrimination. Here, there is abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that the School District did not discriminate against the plaintiff because of her alleged disability. First, the plaintiff's performance was judged by several different evaluators, and defendant Lavely's recommendation for termination was reviewed independently by the School District's Superintendent and Board of Trustees. Second, defendant Lavely hired the plaintiff and then recommended her re-employment for the 2008-09 school [*24]  year, at which time he knew of the plaintiff's ADD,7 which creates "a strong inference . . . that discrimination was not a determining factor for the adverse action taken by the employer." See Proud v. Stone, 945 F.2d 796, 797-98 (4th Cir. 1991) (same actor inference makes discrimination unlikely).
The plaintiff cites a recent case from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, McCarty v. Marple Twp. Ambulance Corps, 869 F. Supp. 2d 638 (E.D. Pa. 2012) in support of her claim (see doc. 230-2 at pp. 1-18). In that case, the court found that a genuine dispute existed as to whether the plaintiff was disabled under the ADA due to his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ("ADHD"). McCarty, 869 F.Supp.2d at 650. The court further found that, based on the temporal proximity between a memorandum alluding to the plaintiff's ADHD symptoms and his actual termination, a factfinder could reasonably find that the defendant's proffered reason for terminating his employment (tardiness) was pretext for discrimination. Id. at 651. Here, in contrast, the plaintiff has failed to submit such evidence of pretext. [*25]  Based upon the foregoing, summary judgment is appropriate on the plaintiff's disability discharge claim as she has failed to satisfy a prima facie case and present evidence of pretext.
The plaintiff further alleges that the defendants failed to reasonably accommodate her disability (see doc. 230-1 at p. 1) by not allowing her to arrive at work "five to eight minutes" late or by excusing her from providing her portfolio to defendant Lavely. Under the ADA, an employer is prohibited from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability. . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Such unlawful discrimination can include the failure to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee. . . ." Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A). Accordingly, in order for the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case against her employer for failure to accommodate under the ADA, the plaintiff must show: " '(1) that [s]he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of h[er] disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation [s]he could perform the essential functions of the position ...; and (4) that [*26]  the [employer] refused to make such accommodations.' " Wilson v. Dollar General Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Rhoads v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n. 11 (4th Cir.2001)).
Defendant Lavely attests that providing a copy of the teaching portfolio is part of the PAS-T evaluation process for every teacher being evaluated (Lavely aff. ¶ 12). As argued by the defendants, the record clearly shows that the plaintiff went far beyond a "request" that defendant Lavely review her portfolio in her presence. She directly accused both defendant Lavely and Ms. Fox of untruthfulness, bad faith, lack of transparency, and lack of partiality (id. ¶¶ 12-13 & ex. H; pl. dep. 181-84).
With regard to the plaintiff's request to come to work late as needed, defendant Lavely states in his affidavit that "[a]ll teachers were required to be at school by 8:15 a.m. for student supervision purposes. Although classes did not start until 8:30, students were released to class from common areas at 8:15 a.m., and teachers were needed for supervision by 8:15. Arrival at school by 8:15 was an essential function of every teacher's job at the school" (Lavely aff. ¶ 5). Defendant Lavely's testimony is supported by a document submitted by the plaintiff from the "Teacher Attendance" section of the 2008-2009 TRHS Handbook, which provides [*27]  in pertinent part, "Teachers should be in their room by 8:15 am preparing for the arrival of students. . . . Teachers assigned early morning duty should report by 8:00 am to their assigned duty stations and remain on duty until just prior to 8:30 am, so they can be in their classrooms when students arrive. . . ." (doc. 230-9 at p. 26). The plaintiff submitted a list of the TRHS Duty Stations for teachers for the first quarter of the 2008-2009 school year (doc. 230-9 at pp. 41-42). She argues that the teachers with early morning duty "did not have to do their 'essential duty' by being in their classrooms at 8:15" a.m. as testified to by defendant Lavely (id. at p. 42). However, the fact that some of the teachers were required to be at work at 8:00 a.m. rather than 8:15 a.m. and that their duty stations for student supervision were in different places rather than their own classrooms prior to 8:30 a.m., does not conflict with defendant Lavely's testimony that "all teachers were required to be at school by 8:15 a.m. for student supervision purposes."
The plaintiff submitted an email from defendant Lavely to the staff at TRHS dated August 26, 2008, in which he stated, "Please remember that you are [*28]  to be in your classroom ready to receive students at 8:15. Walking in the door at 8:15 is not considered to be on time for work" (doc. 230-9 at p. 25). The plaintiff argues that "[e]vidently, there were a number of TRHS staff late to work" (id.). However, the plaintiff has failed to submit any evidence showing that she was treated differently than other teachers with regard to tardiness in such a manner that creates an inference of discrimination. Moreover, the email tends to show that timeliness was an essential function of the position of teacher at TRHS.
The modification the plaintiff requested was that the school change the essential function of timely arrival and a defined start time necessary for supervision of students and use of class time. An accommodation that would eliminate an essential function of a job is not "reasonable" as a matter of law. See Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1366-67 (11th Cir. 2000) (punctuality was essential function of job and request that tardiness be excused was not a reasonable accommodation as a matter of law).
The plaintiff argues that "[a] genuine, material fact remains in that Defendants and I did not engage in an authentic interactive process" (doc. 230-2 at p. 1). However,
The duty to engage in an interactive [*29]  process to identify a reasonable accommodation is generally triggered when an employee communicates to his employer his disability and his desire for an accommodation for that disability. . . .
But the interactive process "is not an end in itself; rather it is a means for determining what reasonable accommodations are available to allow a disabled individual to perform the essential job functions of the position sought." Rehling v. City of Chi., 207 F.3d 1009, 1015 (7th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, even if an employer's duty to engage in the interactive process is triggered, the employer's liability for failing to engage in that process may collapse for a number of reasons.
For example, an employer who fails to engage in the interactive process will not be held liable if the employee cannot identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been possible. . . .
Wilson, 717 F.3d at 346-47. Here, the plaintiff's request to come in late to work as needed would require the defendants to change the essential functions of the plaintiff's job, and thus it is not a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, the plaintiff has not come forward with any evidence indicating that the defendants' failure to engage in an interactive process resulted in a failure [*30]  to identify an appropriate accommodation for her. See Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367. Based upon the foregoing, this claim fails.

Title VII Discrimination and Retaliation
Title VII prohibits an employer from "fail[ing] or refus[ing] to hire or . . . discharg[ing] any individual, or otherwise . . . discriminat[ing] against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). The plaintiff alleges that she was discriminated against because of her race and national origin and that the defendants retaliated against her (2nd amended comp. at p. 95). To state a prima facie claim of religious or national origin discrimination, the plaintiff must prove: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was performing satisfactorily; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) similarly-situated employees received more favorable treatment. Coleman v. Maryland Ct. of Appeals, 626 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the plaintiff must prove that (1) she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer acted adversely against her, and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the asserted adverse action. Id. If [*31]  the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation, and the defendants offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, the plaintiff 'bears the burden of establishing that the employer's proffered explanation is pretext.'" Hoyle v. Freightliner, LLC, 650 F.3d 321, 337 (4th Cir. 2011) (quoting Yashenko v. Harrah's Casino, 446 F.3d 541, 551 (4th Cir. 2006)).
As discussed above with regard to the plaintiff's disability discrimination claim, the plaintiff has not shown that she was performing her job satisfactorily at the time she was discharged, and she has failed to show that similarly-situated employees received more favorable treatment. Moreover, for the same reasons that the plaintiff cannot show that the School District's articulated reasons for her discharge were a pretext for purposes of disability discrimination claim, she cannot show that those reasons were a pretext for purposes of her religious or national origin discrimination claims. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate on these claims.
Furthermore, the ethnic/religious slurs the plaintiff allegedly heard from students, the assembly prayer to which she was exposed, and the concert featuring Christmas songs all occurred in her first year at the school (pl. dep. 158-81) and are separated [*32]  from her termination by more than a year. Accordingly, any alleged causal link would be broken by (1) the plaintiff's new contract for the 2008-09 school year; and (2) the plaintiff's poor job performance and misconduct during late 2008 and early 2009. Assuming arguendo that the plaintiff engaged in protected activity by "promptly" reporting these incidents as she alleges (see pl. dep. 160-76), she has failed to demonstrate a causal connection between any protected activity and her termination. Moreover, for the same reasons her discrimination claims fail, the defendants have articulated non-retaliatory reasons for her termination, and the plaintiff has failed to offer any evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that those reasons were a pretext for retaliation. As such, summary judgment is appropriate on the plaintiff's retaliation claim as well.

State Law Claims
The only remaining causes of action are state law claims. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has held that "the federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction." McQuillen v. National Cash Register Co., 112 F.2d 877, 881 (4th Cir.1940). This court can decline to continue the action as to any supplemental state claims if it "has dismissed all claims over which it [*33]  has original jurisdiction." 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3). Because this court has dismissed all claims over which it had original jurisdiction, the court finds that the remaining state law causes of action should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. See Williams v. Sims, C.A. No. 3:10-862-CMC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134534, 2012 WL 4322085, at *5 (D.S.C. Sept. 20, 2012) ("It is this court's customary practice to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims when the federal claims are dismissed in advance of trial.").

CONCLUSION
Wherefore, based upon the foregoing, the defendants' motion for summary judgment (doc. 199) is granted as to the plaintiff's federal claims. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3), the plaintiff's state law claims are dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The parties' pending nondispositive motions (docs. 165, 185, 187, 202, 203, 204, 205, 209, 211) are hereby rendered moot.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
