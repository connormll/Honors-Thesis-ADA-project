Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This is a pro se civil rights action, initiated upon the filing of the original complaint in this matter by prisoner-Plaintiff Quintez Talley (hereinafter referred to as "Talley") on October 11, 2016. (Doc. 1). Along with his complaint, Talley filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (Doc. 4), which this Court granted in an Order entered on January 5, 2017 (Doc. 6). At the time he initiated this action, Talley was incarcerated at the State Correctional Institution in Benner Township ("SCI-Benner") in Centre County, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 1, at 2, ¶3). He is currently incarcerated at SCI-Fayette in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 80, at 5).
On December 20, 2017, the Court issued a Report and Recommendation, adopted by the [*2]  District Court in full, dismissing Talley's complaint in part and granting him leave to file an amended complaint. (Doc. 20); (Doc. 26). Importantly, the Court dismissed with prejudice Talley's claims brought against the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. (Doc. 26, at 1). Talley filed the now operative amended complaint (the "Complaint") on April 4, 2018. (Doc. 28). In his Complaint, Talley asserts a number of claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") stemming from events that occurred while he was incarcerated at SCI-Benner. Specifically, Talley brings claims against the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections ("DOC"), the Bureau of Health Care Services ("BHCS"), the Chief Safety and Environment Protection Division ("SEPD"), Psychologist Jerrold Lincoln ("Dr. Lincoln"), and the following DOC officials and staff members: DOC Secretary John E. Wetzel, Superintendent Tammy Ferguson, Chief Grievance Officer Dorina Varner, Deputy Superintendent Bobbi Jo Salamon, Safety Manager Tammy S. Fagan, Hearing Examiner Scott Ellenberger, Major Timothy Graham, Major Brian Anstead, Unit Manager Dave Link, Lieutenant ("Lt.") Larry Shaw, Sergeant ("Sgt.") Shayne [*3]  Reiter, Corrections Officer ("CO") Nathan Balko, and CO Jon Saylor. (Doc. 28, at 2-3, ¶¶ 4-19). All Defendants have entered their appearance in this matter through counsel.
Now pending before the Court are two Motions for Summary Judgment brought by Defendants. (Doc. 74); (Doc. 76). One of these motions, (Doc. 74), is brought by Defendants Anstead, Ellenberger, Fagan, Ferguson, Graham, Lincoln, Link, Salamon, Saylor, Varner, Wetzel, BHCS, SEPD, and DOC (collectively, "Supervisory Defendants"). The other motion, (Doc. 76), is brought by Defendants Balko, Reiter, and Shaw (collectively, "Correctional Officer Defendants"). These motions have been fully briefed by Defendants, (Doc. 75) (Doc. 77), and Plaintiff has failed to file a brief in opposition on or before the deadline of September 17, 2019. (Doc. 81). This matter is now ripe for disposition.

I. Summary of Material Facts1
The events that give rise to this action took place in October of 2014, while Talley was assigned to SCI-Benner's Restricted Housing Unit ("RHU"). (Doc. 78, at ¶ 39; Doc. 28, at 2, ¶3). Specifically, on October 16, 2014, Talley reported to Lt. Shaw, Sgt. Reiter, and CO Balko that he was feeling suicidal. (Doc. 78, [*4]  at ¶ 40; Doc. 28, at 6, ¶31). Shaw, Reiter, and Balko walked away, leaving Talley alone. (Doc. 78, at ¶ 41). Dr. Lincoln, a psychiatrist, was notified of Talley's suicidal ideations and reported to Talley's cell. (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 42-44; Doc. 78-7, at 51; Doc. 28, at 6, ¶31). Dr. Lincoln then left Talley alone for an unknown amount of time, during which, at some point, his cell caught fire. (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 45-47). Talley does not remember starting the fire, but testified in his deposition, under oath, that he was the only one in his cell. (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 48-49).
While the individual RHU cells at SCI Benner do not have sprinklers, the RHU itself is equipped with a sprinkler system. (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 36-3). This is in accordance with an approved variance from the Uniform Construction Code, obtained when the RHU was being designed and during which SCI Benner was being built in 2010. (Doc. 78, ¶¶ 29-37).
Because of this incident, Talley file a grievance (#538116) on November 19, 2014, in which he complained that Balko, Reiter, and Shaw walked away from his cell when he told them he was going to kill himself. (Doc. 78, ¶ 62). The grievance was initially answered by Defendant Link; the appeal [*5]  to the Facility Manager was answered by Defendant Ferguson. (Doc. 78, ¶¶ 63-64). Talley then appealed to SOIGA, which appeal was answered by Defendant Varner. (Doc. 78, ¶¶ 65-66).
As further result of the incident, Talley was issued a misconduct for arson and destroying property. (Doc 78, at ¶ 73). A misconduct hearing was held, but Talley did not attend; the hearing was held in his absence. (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 74-77). At the conclusion of the hearing, Talley was sanctioned by Ellenberger to ninety (90) days in the RHU for the arson charge and 30 days for destroying property, to be served concurrently. (Doc. 78, at ¶ 77). Talley, however, did not discover the imposition of discipline until November 25, 2014, which prompted him to submit an appeal to the Program Review Committee ("PRC"). (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 78-79). That appeal was dismissed by the PC as untimely. (Doc. 78, at ¶ 79).
Remaining before this Court are Talley's claims of deliberate indifference and conspiracy related to fire safety at SCI Benner and his mental health treatment. The Correctional Officer Defendants have moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the record establishes that they were not deliberately indifferent [*6]  to Talley's needs, that Talley's conspiracy claim fails, and that they are entitled to qualified immunity against Talley's claims. The Supervisory Defendants have moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Talley failed to exhaust his claims against them; that the Department and BHCS are not "persons" subject to liability under § 1983; that Talley's claims related to mental health treatment, fire safety, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and conspiracy fail; and finally, that they are entitled to qualified immunity. Both sets of defendants submit in their Motions for Summary Judgment that there are no material facts in dispute and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Doc. 75); (Doc. 77).

II. Motion for Summary Judgment Standard
Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment should be granted only if "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is "material" only if it might affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute of material fact is "genuine" if the evidence "is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. In deciding a summary judgment motion, all inferences "should be drawn [*7]  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and where the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, then the non-movant's must be taken as true." Pastore v. Bell Tel. Co. of Pa., 24 F.3d 508, 512 (3d Cir. 1994).
A federal court should grant summary judgment "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d 271, 278 (3d Cir. 2000). The Court need not accept mere conclusory allegations, whether they are made in the complaint or a sworn statement. Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888, 110 S. Ct. 3177, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1990). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court's function is not to make credibility determinations, weigh evidence, or draw inferences from the facts. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. Rather, the court must simply "determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Id.
"Although the party opposing summary judgment is entitled to the 'benefit of all factual inferences in the court's consideration of a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must point to some evidence in the record that creates a genuine issue of material fact.'"2 Velentzas v. U.S., No. 4: CV - 07-1255, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102928, 2010 WL 3896192, *7 (M.D. Pa. August 31, 2010) (quoting Goode v. Nash, 241 F. App'x 868, 868 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). The opposing party 'cannot [*8]  rest solely on assertions made in the pleadings, legal memorandum, or oral argument.' Id. If the non-moving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [the non-movant's] case, and on which [the non-movant] will bear the burden of proof at trial," Rule 56 mandates the entry of summary judgment because such a failure "necessarily renders all other facts immaterial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Jakimas v. Hoffmann—La Roche, Inc., 485 F.3d 770, 777 (3d Cir.2007).

III. Discussion
A. Section 1983 Claims
Talley's complaint asserts several federal civil rights claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This law provides a private cause of action with respect to violations of federal constitutional rights. The statute provides in pertinent part:
Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .
42 U.S.C. § 1983.
The § 1983 statute does not create substantive [*9]  rights, but instead provides remedies for rights established elsewhere. City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 816, 105 S. Ct. 2427, 85 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1985). To state a § 1983 claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendants, acting under color of state law, deprived the plaintiff of a right secured by the United States Constitution. Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, 51 F.3d 1137, 1141 (3d Cir. 1995).
B. Supervisory Defendants

1. Defendant Saylor
Supervisory Defendants note that Defendant Saylor is only mentioned in the operative complaint as having issued the grievance, and as included in the list of Defendants. Talley does not allege that Saylor has violated any of his rights, and Talley has not filed anything with the Court in opposition to that statement or otherwise disputing that. As such, summary judgment will be granted to Defendant Saylor.

2. The Department and BHCS
Defendants, the Department of Corrections and its Bureau of Health Care Services, move for summary judgment on the ground that these entities are not "persons" capable of liability under § 1983. Suits against states are barred by the Eleventh Amendment's grant of sovereign immunity. Winn v. State Corr. Inst. Camp Hill, No. 1:CV-16-1641, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115302, 2016 WL 4502378, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 29, 2016); Koslow v. Pennsylvania, 302 F.3d 161, 167-68 (3d Cir. 2002). State agencies, such as the Department of Corrections, and bureaus within the DOC such as the BHCS, enjoy the same level of immunity as the state. Winn, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115302, 2016 WL 4502378, at *4;  [*10] see Cloverland—Green Spring Dairies, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Milk Mktg. Bd., 298 F.3d 201, 205 n. 2 (3d Cir. 2002). Moreover, neither the DOC nor BHCS is a "person" contemplated under §1983. See Pettaway v. SCI-Albion, 487 F. App'x 766, 768 (3d Cir. 2012)(nonprecedential). Accordingly, the Department and BHCS are entitled to summary judgment.

3. Exhaustion
Supervisory Defendants submit that all claims against them must fail because Talley failed to exhaust his administrative remedies against the Supervisory Defendants. Specifically, Supervisory Defendants submit that in the one grievance Talley filed related to this suit, he failed to identify any of the Supervisory Defendants. (Doc. 75, at 19).
The Prison Litigation Reform Act ("PLRA") requires inmates to exhaust administrative remedies, i.e. the prison grievance process, prior to bringing a federal lawsuit. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). To properly exhaust a grievance so as to be able to bring suit in court, the inmate must satisfy the administrative requirements set forth by the prison. Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 230 (3d Cir. 2004). If the prison's administrative requirements are not met, then the action is deemed procedurally defaulted and cannot be brought in federal court. Spruill, 372 F.3d at 230. The purpose of this exhaustion requirement is to alert prison officials to an issue and give them the opportunity to remedy it before it is presented to the federal courts. Williams v. Beard, 482 F.3d 637, 640 (3d Cir. 2007).
DOC Administrative [*11]  Directive 804 (DC-ADM 804) provides inmates with specific requirements for filing grievances and appeals to grievance responses. (Doc. 78, at ¶ 50). An inmate may file a grievance within fifteen working from the event upon which the grievance is based. (Doc. 78, at ¶ 51). The inmate must include a statement of facts relevant to the claim, identify individuals directly involved in the event, and specifically state any claims he wishes to make. (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 52-54). If an inmate is dissatisfied with the initial response to his grievance, he may file an appeal to the Facility Manger. (Doc. 78, at ¶ 56). An inmate dissatisfied with the decision of the Facility Manager may appeal to final review with the Chief of the Secretary's Office of Inmate Grievances and Appeals ("SOIGA"). (Doc. 78, at ¶58).
Defendants move for summary judgment for failure to exhaust on the grounds that Talley failed to identify any of the Supervisory Defendants in his grievance. There is no dispute that Talley did appeal this grievance through to a final appeal with SOIGA. (Doc. 78, at ¶ 65-67). There is also no dispute that the grievance (Doc. 78-7, at 51) does not identify any of the Supervisory Defendants. Defendants [*12]  do not submit or argue that the names of the supervisors were not known throughout the grievance procedure, only that they are not specifically named in the grievance.
An inmate's failure to name individuals in his grievances is not dispositive as to whether he properly administratively exhausted his claims. Wood v. Detwiler, 782 F. App'x 103, 105 (3d Cir. 2019); Cf. Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 234 (3d Cir. 2004) (holding that a prison can excuse an inmate's failure to identify "by identifying the unidentified persons and acknowledging that they were fairly within the compass of the prisoner's grievance"). When an inmate's allegations "have been fully examined on the merits" and "at the highest level," they are, in fact, exhausted. Rinaldi v. United States, 904 F.3d 257, 271 (3d Cir. 2018); Camp v. Brennan, 219 F.3d 279, 281 (3d Cir. 2000).
In this case, despite the Supervisory Defendants not being named in the grievance, it does appear from the undisputed record that Talley's grievance related to his claims were fully examined on the merits at the highest level. As such, and in accordance with the Third Circuit's rulings in Wood and Rinaldi, supra, it is recommended that the Supervisory Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the grounds of exhaustion be denied.

4. Fire Safety Claims
The Supervisory Defendants move for summary judgment on Talley's claims related to fire safety — an Eighth Amendment claim of deliberate indifference [*13]  against Defendants Wetzel, Ferguson, McSurdy, and Fagan; and a Fourteenth Amendment claim against Defendants Wetzel, McSurdy, and Fagan. Specifically, Talley claims that the failure to equip the RHU prison cells at SCI-Benner with a sprinkler system was in deliberate indifference to his health and safety in violation of the Eighth Amendment (Doc. 28, at ¶¶ 56-57), and further, that the failure to ensure that the RHU cells were sufficiently equipped with fire prevention equipment was in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights (Doc. 28, at ¶ 64). For the following reasons, the Court finds that both these claims fail for lack of personal involvement. Each named defendant in a federal civil rights claims brought under § 1983 must be shown to have been personally involved in the events or occurrences which underlie a claim. See Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976); Hampton v. Holmesburg Prison Officials, 546 F.2d 1077 (3d Cir.1976). The Supervisory Defendants could only be held liable under § 1983 for a deprivation of a constitutional right if they had some "personal involvement" in it. Lopez v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., 499 F. App'x 142, 146 (3d Cir. 2012); Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988). Nothing in undisputed record before this Court demonstrates any personal involvement by any of the Supervisory Defendants in the design or use of the sprinkler system. There is no allegation or fact in the record, for example, that the Supervisory Defendants were [*14]  deliberately indifferent to the use of a sprinkler system. Rather, Talley's claims center on the fact that no sprinkler system exists in the RHU cells. The record is clear that the design of the prison, including the RHU cells, the sprinkler system, and the variance obtained for the design, in no way involved any of the Supervisory Defendants. (Doc. 78, ¶¶ 29-37). As such, it is recommended that summary judgment be granted in favor of the Supervisory Defendants on Talley's claims related to fire safety.

5. Mental Health Treatment Claims
Talley alleges that claims that Defendants Salamon, Graham, Anstead, Link, Varner, and BHCS, "abdicated their duty to supervise" and monitor his mental health treatment. (Doc. 28, ¶ 59). He submits that Defendants Wetzel, Ferguson, Salamon, Graham, Anstead, and Lincoln were "willfully blind" to the effect of disciplinary custody on his mental wellbeing. (Doc. 28, ¶ 61). He alleges that Defendant Ellenberger's sanctioning was in violation of the Eighth Amendment (Doc. 28, ¶ 58), that Defendant Lincoln's failure to note his self-injurious behavior on the misconduct form (Doc. 28, ¶ 62), and Defendant Ellenberger's failure to provide him with notice of his decision within [*15]  the time allotted to appeal (Doc. 28, ¶ 63) both violated the Fourteenth Amendment.
a. Lack of Personal Involvement
The undisputed record before this Court demonstrates that Defendants Link, Varner, Ferguson, Ellenberger, and Wetzel had no personal involvement in Talley's mental health treatment. Defendants Link, Varner, and Ferguson are only linked to Talley through their participation in the grievance process. (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 63-66). Defendant Ellenberger is only alleged to have participated as a Hearing Examiner and having issued the 90-day disciplinary custody sanction. (DOC. 78, AT ¶ 78). The allegations against Defendants Salamon, Graham, and Anstead involve their denial of Talley's misconduct appeal (Doc. 78, at ¶ 81). Finally, the only claims against Defendant Wetzel are conclusory statements of supervisory responsibility. These Defendants are entitled to summary judgment in their favor for lack of personal involvement in Talley's § 1983 claims. Their involvement, as reflected in the record, is insufficient as a matter of law to render them defendants liable. Lewis v. Wetzel, 153 F. Supp. 3d 678, 696-97 (M.D. Pa. 2015); see also Rauso v. Vaughn, Civil No. 96-6977, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9035, 2000 WL 873285, at *16 (E.D.Pa., June 26, 2000) ("[T]he failure of a prison official to act favorably on an inmate's grievance is not itself a constitutional violation."); Caldwell v. Beard, Civil No. 2:07-CV-727, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125174, 2008 WL 2887810, at *4 (W.D.Pa. July 23, 2008) [*16]  ("Such a premise for liability [i.e., for performing a role in the grievance process] fails as a matter of law."), aff'd, 324 F. App'x 186 (3d Cir.2009); Caldwell v. Hall, Civil No. 97-8069, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4022, 2000 WL 343229, at *2 (E.D.Pa. March 31, 2000) ("The failure of a prison official to act favorably on an inmate's grievance is not itself a constitutional violation."); Orrs v. Comings, Civil No. 92-6442, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14615, 1993 WL 418361, at *2 (E.D.Pa. Oct.13, 1993) ("But an allegation that a defendant failed to act on a grievance *697 or complaint does not state a Section 1983 claim."); Jefferson v. Wolfe, Civil No. 04-44, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101690, 2006 WL 1947721, at *17 (W.D.Pa. July 11, 2006) ("These allegations [of denying grievances or grievance appeals] are insufficient to establish such Defendants' personal involvement in the challenged conduct under Section 1983.").
For these reasons, it is recommended that Defendants Link, Varner, Ferguson, Ellenberger, Wetzel, Salamon, Graham, and Anstead be granted judgment in their favor for lack of personal involvement in Talley's mental health treatment claims.
b. Lack of Significant or Atypical Hardship as a Result of the Misconduct Process
Finally, as to Defendant Lincoln, Talley's allegation against him related to his mental health treatment stems from Defendant Lincoln's alleged failure to note Talley's self-injurious behavior on the misconduct form (Doc. 28, ¶ 62). The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that a person shall not be deprived of "life, liberty, or property, without [*17]  due process of law." U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Thus, Fourteenth Amendment "procedural due process rights are triggered by a deprivation of a legally cognizable liberty interest." Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 531 (3d Cir. 2003). For an inmate, such a deprivation occurs when the prison "imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life." Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S. Ct. 2293, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1995). In determining whether such a hardship was imposed on the inmate, courts look to (1) the duration of the disciplinary confinement and (2) the conditions of that confinement in relation to other prison conditions. Sandin; see also Shoats v. Horn, 213 F.3d 140, 144 (3d Cir. 2000). Here, Defendant Lincoln is entitled to summary judgment on Talley's Fourteenth Amendment claim.
The undisputed record before the Court reflects that there was no requirement by Defendant Lincoln to note that the fire in Talley's cell was a purported act of self-injurious behavior. (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 71-72). Further, being subjected to the sanction of 90 days in disciplinary custody is not within the parameters of an "atypical or significant hardship." See Goode v. Nutter, No. CV 13-3682, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137600, 2017 WL 3710792, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 28, 2017); Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 653 (3d Cir. 2002) (holding that seven months in disciplinary custody was not a deprivation of a cognizable liberty interest); Griffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir. 1997) (concluding that the placement of a prisoner in administrative custody for a period [*18]  of fifteen months did not impose an atypical and significant hardship which deprived the prisoner of a liberty interest and thus did not implicate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment). Moreover, the record contains no other evidence of any conditions resulting from Defendant Lincoln's conduct which could be construed as imposing such a hardship. As such, it is recommended that Defendant Lincoln be granted summary judgment on Talley's mental health treatment claims.

6. Mental Illness Does Not Provide "Immunity" From Disciplinary Sanctions
Talley brings claims against Defendants Lincoln, Salamon, Graham, and Anstead pursuant to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") alleging that he did not receive any reasonable accommodation of his mental illness during the disciplinary process and was thus denied the benefit of immunity from disciplinary sanctions. (Doc. 28, at ¶ 65).
Title II of the ADA provides, in relevant part, that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services or activities of a public entity or be subjected to discrimination by such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. The Act's definition of the term "public [*19]  entity" has been held to include state prisons. Parms v. Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr., No. CA 14-84, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37821, 2015 WL 1326323, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 25, 2015); Pennsylvania Dept. of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 210, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1998), citing 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(B). Talley's claim that he could not be disciplined by being placed in the RHU because it would be detrimental to his mental health and thus violative of the ADA ... does not constitute a denial of a service or program under the statute. Goins v. Beard, No. CIV.A. 09-1223, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104442, 2011 WL 4345874, at*12 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 15, 2011) (quoting Scherer v. Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr., No. CIV.A. 3:2004-191, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84935, 2007 WL 4111412, at *10 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 16, 2007)). Further, Talley's assertion that his mental illness was not considered in his sanctions is belied by the record before this Court, which indicates that his arson misconduct noted his mental illness. (Doc. 78, at ¶ 74).
For these reasons, it is recommended that Defendants Lincoln, Salamon, Graham, and Anstead be granted summary judgment on Talley's ADA claim.

7. Conspiracy Claims
Finally, Talley asserts a conspiracy claim against Defendants Ferguson, BHCS, Link, and Varner. (Doc. 28, ¶ 66). In order to prevail on a conspiracy claim under § 1983, Talley must prove that persons acting under color of state law conspired to deprive him of a federally protected right. Martin v. Unknown U.S. Marshals, 965 F. Supp. 2d 502, 547 (D.N.J. 2013), aff'd sub nom. Estate of Martin v. U.S. Marshals Serv. Agents, 649 F. App'x 239 (3d Cir. 2016); see White v. Brown, 408 F. App'x 595, 599 (3d Cir.2010) (citing Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E. ex rel. M.E., 172 F.3d 238, 254 (3d Cir.1999)). The grant of summary judgment is proper on such a claim where a plaintiff cannot establish [*20]  an underlying violation of any constitutional rights. See Young v. County of Fulton, 160 F.3d 899, 904 (2d Cir.1998) ("There was no deprivation of a federal constitutional right, and therefore there can be no civil rights conspiracy to deprive that right."). Having determined that the Supervisory Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Talley's claims that they violated his federal constitutional rights, Talley's conspiracy claim cannot survive. As such, it is respectfully recommended that summary judgment be granted to the Supervisory Defendants on Talley's claim of conspiracy.
For the foregoing reasons, it is recommended that the Court grant the motion for summary judgment of the Supervisory Defendants (Doc. 74) in its entirety.3
C. Correctional Officer Defendants
The Correctional Officer Defendants have also moved for summary judgment as to all claims against them. (Doc. 76). Specifically, the CO Defendants allege that Talley cannot establish a claim of Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference or conspiracy by them, or alternatively, that they are entitled to qualified immunity. (Doc. 77, at 6-13).

1. Deliberate Indifference
The core of Talley's claims against the CO Defendants — Shaw, Balko, and Reiter - is that these Defendants walked away from his [*21]  cell after he reported feeling suicidal. The undisputed facts in the record establish that on October 16, 2014, the CO Defendants did walk away from Talley's cell after Talley reported to them that he was feeling suicidal, leaving him alone in his cell. (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 40-41; Doc. 28, at 6, ¶31).
It is clearly established in this Circuit that the suicide of a pretrial detainee can support a recovery in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action as a Constitutional violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., 946 F.2d 1017, 1023 (1991); Plasko v. City of Pottsville, 852 F. Supp. 1258 (E.D. Pa. 1994); Simmons v. City of Phila., 947 F.2d 1042, 1067 (3d Cir. 1991). Such claims "present[ ] difficult issues because no state actor directly inflicted harm" on the prisoner. Swan by Carello v. Daniels, 923 F. Supp. 626, 631 (D. Del. 1995); quoting Colburn, 946 F.2d at 1023. Instead, a plaintiff must show that prison officials were deliberately indifferent in failing to prevent the self-inflicted harm. When a plaintiff seeks to hold a prison official liable for failing to prevent an inmate's suicide, whether a pre-trial detainee or a convicted prisoner, the plaintiff must show: (1) the individual had a particular vulnerability to suicide, meaning that there was strong likelihood, rather than a mere possibility, of a suicide attempt; (2) the prison official knew or should have known of that vulnerability; and (3) the official acted with reckless indifference to the individual's particular [*22]  vulnerability. Alexander v. Monroe County, 734 Fed. Appx. 801 (2018); Palakovic v. Wetzel, 854 F.3d 209 (3d Cir. 2017); Colburn, 946 F.2d at 1023. A "strong likelihood" of suicide is so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for preventative action. Palakovic, 854 F.3d at 222; quoting Colburn, 946 F.2d at 1025. The Court must determine whether the evidentiary record in this case could support a finding by the jury that Talley had a particular vulnerability to suicide, and that the Defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical need. The Defendants submit that the record does not reflect any deliberate indifference by Defendants towards Talley's particular vulnerability to suicide.
Reckless or deliberate indifference to that risk only demands "something more culpable on the part of the officials than a negligent failure to recognize the high risk of suicide." Palakovic, 854 F.3d at 231 (citing Woloszyn, 396 F.3d at 320). Deliberate indifference is a willingness to ignore a foreseeable danger or risk or conscience shocking behavior for unhurried situations. Kedra v. Schroeter, 876 F.3d 424, 446 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 910 (3d Cir. 1997); Vargas v. City of Phila., 783 F.3d 962, 973 (3d Cir. 2015) ). The proof required is "something less than knowledge that the harm was practically certain." Kedra, 876 F.3d at 446 (quoting Ziccardi v. City of Phila., 288 F.3d 57, 66 (3d Cir. 2002)). A detainee's "strong likelihood" of suicide "must be 'so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for' preventative action." Palakovic, supra. "Liability may not be imposed unless 'there [*23]  is something more culpable on the part of the officials than a negligent failure to recognize the high risk of suicide.' Instead, the 'strong likelihood of suicide must be so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for preventative action.'" Estate of Thomas, 194 F. Supp. 3d 358, 2016 WL 3639887, at *14 (quoting Colburn, 946 F.2d at 1023) (internal citations omitted).
Here, while it is undisputed that Talley did report feeling suicidal to the CO Defendants, the record does not establish that the CO Defendants failed to recognize a risk or failed to recognize the need for preventative action. After Talley reported to the CO Defendants that he was feeling suicidal, these Defendants notified the prison psychiatrist, Dr. Lincoln, of Talley's ideations. (Doc. 78, at ¶¶ 40-42; Doc. 28, at 6, ¶31). As such, the undisputed record before the Court reflects that the CO Defendants recognized a risk and took steps to address the risk. Talley has failed to come forward with evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the CO Defendants Losinger or Kapichok consciously disregarded Talley's particular vulnerability to suicide. As such, Talley's deliberate indifference claim against the CO Defendants fails, and it is recommended that summary [*24]  judgment be granted in CO Defendants favor on Talley's claim of deliberate indifference. See Kelley v. Bradford Cty., No. 3:07-CV-1531, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27290, 2010 WL 1136313, at *6 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 23, 2010).

2. Conspiracy Claims
Talley also asserts a conspiracy claim against the CO Defendants. (Doc. 28, ¶ 66). In order to prevail on a conspiracy claim under § 1983, Talley must prove that persons acting under color of state law conspired to deprive him of a federally protected right. Martin v. Unknown U.S. Marshals, 965 F. Supp. 2d 502, 547 (D.N.J. 2013), aff'd sub nom. Estate of Martin v. U.S. Marshals Serv. Agents, 649 F. App'x 239 (3d Cir. 2016); see White v. Brown, 408 F. App'x 595, 599 (3d Cir.2010) (citing Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E. ex rel. M.E., 172 F.3d 238, 254 (3d Cir.1999)). The grant of summary judgment is proper on such a claim where a plaintiff cannot establish an underlying violation of any constitutional rights. See Young v. County of Fulton, 160 F.3d 899, 904 (2d Cir.1998) ("There was no deprivation of a federal constitutional right, and therefore there can be no civil rights conspiracy to deprive that right."). Having determined that the Supervisory Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Talley's claims that they violated his federal constitutional rights, Talley's conspiracy claim cannot survive. As such, it is respectfully recommended that summary judgment be granted to the CO Defendants on Talley's claim of conspiracy.
For the foregoing reasons, it is recommended that the Court grant the motion for summary judgment of the CO Defendants (Doc. 76) in its entirety.4

IV. [*25]  Recommendation
For the foregoing reasons, it is recommended that the Motion for Summary Judgment brought by Defendants Anstead, Ellenberger, Fagan, Ferguson, Graham, Lincoln, Link, Salamon, Saylor, Varner, Wetzel, BHCS, SEPD, and DOC (Doc. 74) be GRANTED; the Motion for Summary Judgment brought by Defendants Balko, Ryder, and Shaw (Doc. 76) be GRANTED; and that the Clerk of Court be directed to CLOSE this case.
