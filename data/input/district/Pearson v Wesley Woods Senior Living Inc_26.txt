Opinion



NON-FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiff Miguelina Pearson filed the above-captioned action pro se on January 10, 2019, and counsel entered an appearance on her behalf on May 9, 2019. Plaintiff alleges that her former employer Wesley Woods Senior Living, Inc., doing business as Wesley Woods Senior Living Center (Defendant or "Wesley Woods") discriminated against her on the basis of her race and national origin, and maintained a hostile work environment, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq. Plaintiff also claims that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621, et seq. and discriminated against her on the basis of a disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [*2]  ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.
The action is before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Partial Dismissal [7]. Defendant has moved to dismiss the Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the ADA on the ground that Plaintiff failed to exhaust the administrative remedies required under the ADA before bringing this claim. For the reasons set forth below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the Motion for Partial Dismissal [7] be GRANTED, and that Plaintiff's claim under the ADA be DISMISSED on the ground that Plaintiff failed to exhaust the required administrative remedies.

I. BACKGROUND
The following allegations are taken from Plaintiff's Complaint and are assumed to be true for the purpose of this discussion. Plaintiff alleges that she is Hispanic and has broken English, she is over forty years of age, and she has a disability recognized under the ADA. Compl. [1] ¶ 2. Plaintiff alleges that she was employed by Defendant Wesley Woods for "some 15 years" before she was "wrongfully terminated on December 7, 2017. Id. at ¶ 3. She further alleges that, during her employment at Wesley Woods, she was "subjected to repeated disparate treatment discrimination" as well as a "hostile work environment." Id. at [*3]  ¶ 8. She claims that "work rules and policies were applied more strictly to her compared to other similarly situated employees not in her protected class and/or who were not disabled." Id. She further claims that, after she was terminated "under the pretext of not following the rules," she was replaced by "a younger person not in her protected class." Id. at ¶¶ 9, 11. Based on these facts, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her race and national origin, in violation of Title VII; on the basis of her age, in violation of the ADEA; and on the basis of her disability, in violation of the ADA. Id. at ¶¶ 1, 12.
Plaintiff further alleges that, on an unspecified date, she filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), EEOC Charge No. 410-2018-04428. Id. at ¶ 6. She alleges that the EEOC issued a "dismissal and notice of rights letter" with respect to that EEOC Charge on October 12, 2018, she received the letter "several days after it was dated," and she filed this action within ninety days of her receipt of that letter. Id.

II. DISCUSSION
A. Standard on a Motion to Dismiss
Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a complaint need only [*4]  contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief," in order to "give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957)). A plaintiff, however, may not merely plead facts in a complaint sufficient to find a claim to relief is conceivable; instead, the complaint must set forth "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. at 570.
Defendant has moved to dismiss Plaintiff's ADA claim under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court generally cannot consider matters outside of the pleadings, and must accept the allegations of the non-movant's pleadings as true, but "[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Moreover, "a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted).
Iqbal went on to instruct that, while a [*5]  court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true, it need not accept as true legal conclusions recited in a complaint. Repeating that "only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss" the Supreme Court advised that "[d]etermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not 'shown'—'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)) (other citations omitted).
As noted, a court ordinarily cannot consider matters outside the pleadings when evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) without converting the motion to a motion for summary judgment. See Redding v. Tuggle, No. 1:05-CV-2899-WSD, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52718, 2006 WL 2166726, at *5 (N.D. Ga. July 31, 2006). However, "conversion is not always required." Chesnut v. Ethan Allen Retail, Inc., 971 F. Supp. 2d 1223, 1228 (N.D. Ga. 2013); Patterson v. WMW, Inc., No. 1:11-CV-3172-WSD-SSC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116034, 2012 WL 3261290, at *3 (N.D. Ga. June 15, 2012), adopted by 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111350, 2012 WL 3260619 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 8, 2012). When a plaintiff has referred to documents in the complaint and such documents are central to the plaintiff's claims, a court may consider those documents as part of [*6]  the pleadings in the case and may consider them in ruling on a motion to dismiss. See Brooks v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., 116 F.3d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir. 1997) ("where the plaintiff refers to certain documents in the complaint and those documents are central to the plaintiff's claim, then the court may consider the documents part of the pleadings for the purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal").
Further, when a court is considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), documents attached to the motion to dismiss may be considered if the document is both central to the plaintiff's claim and its contents are undisputed. See SFM Holdings, Ltd. v. Banc of Am. Sec., LLC, 600 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir. 2010); Day v. Taylor, 400 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir. 2005); Horsley v. Feldt, 304 F.3d 1125, 1134 (11th Cir. 2002); see also Chesnut, 971 F. Supp.2d at 1228-29 (considering EEOC document without converting motion to dismiss to motion for summary judgment, stating "a document central to the complaint that the defense appends to its motion to dismiss is also properly considered, provided that its contents are not in dispute"). "'Undisputed' means that the authenticity of the document is not challenged." Day, 400 F.3d at 1276.
Moreover, when considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, such as the pending motion, "'it is proper for a judge to consider facts outside of the pleadings and to resolve factual disputes so long as the factual disputes do not decide the merits and the parties have sufficient [*7]  opportunity to develop a record.'" Tillery v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 402 F. App'x 421, 424 (11th Cir. 2010) (unpublished) (quoting Bryant v. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1376 (11th Cir. 2008)); see also Graton v. Owens, No. 7:09-CV-99 (HL), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79979, at *4 (M.D.Ga. July 13, 2010) (noting that "[t]he Eleventh Circuit has held that a district court may consider materials outside of the pleadings and resolve factual disputes regarding exhaustion in conjunction with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss so long as the factual disputes do not decide the merits of the case" (citing Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1376-77)), adopted by 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79960 (M.D.Ga. Aug. 9, 2010).
In particular, "the EEOC charge is a document that courts routinely consider when ruling on motions to dismiss, even if it is not attached to a pleading." Chesnut, 971 F. Supp.2d at 1228; see also Caetio v. Spirit Coach, LLC, 992 F. Supp.2d 1199, 1208 (N.D. Ala. 2014) ("As the EEOC charges are referenced in plaintiffs' complaint and are central to their claims, this court will consider those forms on defendant's motion to dismiss without converting the motion into a motion for summary judgment."). "In addition, 'the court may consider public records on a motion to dismiss without converting the motion to one for summary judgment.'" Patterson, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116034, 2012 WL 3261290, at *3 (internal citation omitted).
In this case, although Plaintiff alleges in the Complaint that she filed EEOC Charge No. 410-2018-04428 against Defendant, she failed to attach a copy of the EEOC Charge to the Complaint. See Compl. at ¶ 6. Defendant, however, filed [*8]  a copy of Plaintiff's EEOC Charge No. 410-2018-04428 as an exhibit to its brief in support of its Motion to Dismiss, and Plaintiff does not challenge the authenticity of that document. See Def. Ex. 1 [7-2], att. to Def. Br. [7-1].
Thus, the Court finds that it may consider the Plaintiff's EEOC Charge because it is central to the Plaintiff's claims, not in dispute, and relevant to the issue of Plaintiff's exhaustion of administrative remedies. See Tillery, 402 F. App'x at 425 ("in ruling on DHS's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss based solely on exhaustion of administrative remedies and not on the merits of Tillery's claims, the district court did not err in considering evidence outside the pleadings or in making fact findings as to exhaustion"); Horne v. Potter, 392 F. App'x 800, 802 (11th Cir. 2010) ("the district court did not err in considering the exhibits attached to the USPS's motion to dismiss, including the Notification of Personnel Action and the March 26, 2009 EEOC right to sue letter, because they were central to the claims in Horne's complaint and were undisputed"); see also Patterson, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116034, 2012 WL 3261290 at *4 ("The undersigned finds that in deciding Defendant's motion, the court may consider the documents attached to Plaintiff's response because they are administrative records; they are central to her [*9]  claims; they are not in dispute; they are relevant to the issue of Plaintiff's exhaustion of administrative remedies; and the EEOC charge is referred to in Plaintiff's complaint."); Sessom v. Wellstar Hosp., No. 1:08-CV-2057-TWT-LTW, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126752, at *6 n. 1 (N.D.Ga. Apr. 27, 2009) (finding that, even though the EEOC charge was not attached to the plaintiff's complaint, it was "properly considered on the motion to dismiss because Plaintiff has not disputed its authenticity and refers to it in her Complaint," and "it is central to Plaintiff's cause of action given that the filing of an EEOC charge is a condition precedent to filing a Title VII claim"), adopted by 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105920 (N.D.Ga. May 28, 2009).
B. Plaintiff's Claim of Disability Discrimination
In the Motion for Partial Dismissal, Defendant has moved to dismiss only Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the ADA. Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to exhaust the required administrative remedies on that claim because she failed to mention any alleged disability in her EEOC Charge, nor did she allege that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her disability.
Before a plaintiff may pursue a claim of employment discrimination under the ADA, she first must exhaust the required administrative [*10]  remedies, which follow the same procedures as those required under Title VII. See Zillyette v. Capital One Financial Corp., 179 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir. 1999) ("It is settled law that, under the ADA, plaintiffs must comply with the same procedural requirements to sue as exist under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a))). The first administrative remedy that must be exhausted is proper filing of a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. See Batson v. Salvation Army, 897 F.3d 1320, 1327 (11th Cir. 2018); see also Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir. 2001).
In "deferral states," or those states with a state agency equivalent to the EEOC, the charge must be filed within 300 days. See Jones v. Dillard's Inc., 331 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir. 2003). In "non-deferral states," however, or states without a state equivalent to the EEOC, an employee aggrieved by discriminatory acts file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days "after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e); see Jones, 331 F.3d at 1263. Georgia is a non-deferral state; therefore, the Plaintiff in this case was required to file an EEOC Charge within 180 days after the last alleged act of discrimination or harassment. See Sheffield v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 403 Fed. Appx. 452, 454 n.2 (11th Cir. 2010).
Pursuant to that requirement, any claim based on a discrete act of discrimination prior to the 180-day period is not actionable. See, e.g., Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light, 135 F.3d 1428, 1435 (11th Cir. 1998); Beavers v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 975 F.2d 792, 796 (11th Cir. 1992). When an employee files a charge of discrimination, the EEOC conducts an investigation [*11]  into the alleged discriminatory practices of the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(b). Only after the EEOC has notified the aggrieved person of its decision to dismiss the charges or its inability to bring a civil action within the requisite time period can that person bring a civil action. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1) (a civil action may be brought against the respondent named in the charge within ninety days after receipt of the right-to-sue notice); see also Park v. Howard University, 71 F.3d 904, 906, 315 U.S. App. D.C. 196 (D.C. Cir. 1995). An employee must completely exhaust the administrative remedies available from the EEOC before filing suit in federal court. See Buffington v. General Time Corp., 677 F. Supp. 1186, 1192 (M.D. Ga. 1988) (citing Beverly v. Lone Star Lead Constr. Corp., 437 F.2d 1136, 1139-40 (5th Cir. 1971)).
Regardless of timeliness, as a general rule, a plaintiff asserting a claim of employment discrimination cannot bring any claim in a lawsuit that was not included in his or her EEOC charge. See Zellars v. Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co., 907 F. Supp. 355, 358 (M.D. Ala. 1995) (citing Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 47, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 39 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1974). In determining the permissible scope of an employment discrimination complaint, the district court must first look to the EEOC charge and investigation. Evans v. U.S. Pipe & Foundry Co., 696 F.2d 925, 929 (11th Cir. 1983). A plaintiff asserting a claim in federal court is precluded from pursuing any claims in a federal court action that are not "like or related" to the claims asserted by the plaintiff in his or her EEOC charge, or that could not reasonably be expected to arise during the course of the EEOC [*12]  investigation. See Coon v. Georgia Pacific Corp., 829 F.2d 1563, 1569 (11th Cir. 1987); Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970); see also Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1522 (11th Cir. 1985); Evans, 696 F.2d at 928; Buffington, 677 F. Supp. at 1192. Therefore, additional charges in the civil complaint which do not arise naturally and logically from the facts presented to the EEOC are not related to the original charge and cannot be pursued in a civil action.
In this case, a review of Plaintiff's EEOC Charge indicates that she did not allege that the Defendant had discriminated against her because of a disability. See Pl. EEOC Charge, Def. Ex. 1 [7-2], att. to Def. Br. [7-1]. Plaintiff's EEOC Charge 410-2018-04228, dated March 20, 2018, alleges that Defendant Wesley Woods discriminated against her because of her national origin (Hispanic) and her age (55), and retaliated against her for opposing unlawful employment practices. Id. Although Plaintiff mentions in her narrative statement that she took "FMLA leave" ending January 30, 2018, she does not allege that she has a disability or that she was discriminated against on the basis of a disability. See id.
As a result of the Plaintiff's failure to mention any alleged disability in her EEOC Charge, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's claim of disability is beyond the scope of the EEOC Charge because nothing in the Charge put the EEOC, or the Defendant, [*13]  on notice that the Plaintiff was claiming disability discrimination. Thus, the Defendant argues, Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the ADA "could not reasonably be expected to grow out of the EEOC's investigation." Def. Br. at 6. Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's ADA claim must therefore be dismissed because she failed to exhaust the required administrative remedies on that claim before asserting that claim in this action.
In response, the Plaintiff does not dispute that she failed to mention any alleged disability or disability discrimination in her EEOC Charge. See Pl. Resp. [15]. Plaintiff notes, however, that she mentioned that she had taken "FMLA leave," "which may have been taken based on a physical condition that is a disability." Id. at 1. It is not entirely clear from Plaintiff's one-page response whether she is opposing the Defendant's Motion for Partial Dismissal. Plaintiff concedes that she failed to mention any disability or disability discrimination in her EEOC Charge. Although Plaintiff refers to "FMLA leave" in her Charge, it is not clear whether Plaintiff is arguing that her reference to "FMLA leave" was sufficient to put the Defendant on notice that [*14]  she was claiming that she had a disability or that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of a disability.
To the extent that Plaintiff intended to make any argument that the reference to "FMLA leave" in her EEOC Charge was sufficient to put the Defendant on notice that she was claiming that she had a disability or was discriminated against based on a disability, the Court notes that Plaintiff failed to cite to any authority in support of that argument. Moreover, courts have generally held that an employer is not placed on notice of an employee's disability merely because the employee takes medical leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq.
Placing an employee on FMLA leave does not mean that an employer regards the employee as disabled for ADA purposes. "ADA's 'disability' and FMLA's 'serious health condition' are different concepts, and must be analyzed separately." 29 C.F.R. § 825.702(b). Further, "[t]he leave provisions of the [FMLA] are wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations of employers covered under the ADA." 29 C.F.R. § 825.702(a).
Morales v. Georgia Dep't of Human Res., No. 7:08-CV-156 HL, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118154, 2010 WL 4639279, at *8 (M.D. Ga. Nov. 8, 2010), aff'd sub nom. Morales v. Georgia Dep't of Human Res., Dep't of Human Res., Div. of Family & Children Servs., 446 F. App'x 179 (11th Cir. 2011); see also Morisky v. Broward Cty., 80 F.3d 445, 448-49 (11th Cir. 1996) ("Vague or conclusory statements [*15]  revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations under the ADA."); Sneed v. Ken Edwards Enterprises, Inc., No. 1:07-CV-1088-RLV-LTW, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135287, 2009 WL 10668429, at *13-14 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 18, 2009) ("[T]he employer's mere awareness of some symptoms of an employee's alleged disability does not put the employer on notice that the employee is suffering from a disability."), report and recommendation adopted as modified, No. 1:07-CV-1088-RLV, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135187, 2009 WL 10672371 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 17, 2009) (employer's awareness that plaintiff injured his back and was "in a lot of pain" was insufficient to establish that employer had actual knowledge of disability); Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 950 (N.D. Ga. 1995) (knowledge that employee suffered from "stress" did not put employer on sufficient notice of employee's disability).
Thus, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's mention of "FMLA leave" in her narrative statement in her EEOC Charge was not sufficient to put the EEOC or the Defendant on notice that she was claiming that she had a disability or that she had been discriminated against on the basis of a disability. Accordingly, the Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff failed to exhaust the administrative remedies required under the ADA before bringing her claim of disability discrimination in this action, and that [*16]  claim must be dismissed.
In Plaintiff's response, Plaintiff also states that she "requests that the Case Management Order to be entered at a later date following the parties' Rule 26(f) conference to allow time to amend and assert any other claims other than the ADA claims if the Court finds no administrative exhaustion occurred." Pl. Resp. [15] at 1. The Court notes that the Scheduling Order [17] entered in this case on July 3, 2019, incorporated the time limit for amending pleadings set forth in the parties' Joint Preliminary Report and Discovery Plan [16] ("JPR"), in which the parties stated that they "do not anticipate that any amendments to the pleadings will be necessary." JPR [16] at ¶ 6(a), (b).

III. RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons discussed above, IT IS RECOMMENDED that the Defendant's Motion for Partial Dismissal [7] be GRANTED, and that Plaintiff's claim under the ADA be DISMISSED on the ground that Plaintiff failed to exhaust the required administrative remedies under the ADA.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 18th day of July, 2019.
