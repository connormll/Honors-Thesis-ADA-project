REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

(Doc. 37)
Steven H. Cullison began working for the Dauphin County Department of Solid Waste and Recycling in 2004 as a part-time recyclable materials collector. When Cullison was hired, the County was aware that he suffered from blood clots in his legs, degenerative disc disease, and diabetes. In 2006, Cullison became a full-time recycling maintenance worker. Cullison was fired in 2009 at age 59 without ever having a negative performance review. Defendants contend Cullison was fired for filing a false report concerning an accident involving his county vehicle.
Cullison brings this complaint for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief raising several claims:
Count  [*2] I - FMLA Interference Claim under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2654.
Count II - FMLA Retaliation Claim
Count III - Age Discrimination Claim (ADA) in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12300;
Count IV - Age Discrimination Claim (PHRA) in violation of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA), 43 P.S. §§ 951-63;
Count V - Disability Discrimination Claim (ADA) in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12300;
Count VI - Disability Discrimination Claim (PHRA) in violation of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA), 43 P.S. §§ 951-63.
Cullison filed his original complaint on April 2, 2010. (Doc. 1). He was granted leave to file an amended complaint on January 4, 2011 after receiving his right to sue letter from the EEOC (Doc. 24-1, Doc. 51).
Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with exhibits on September 1, 2011 (Docs. 37-1 to 37-22), along with a brief and a statement of material facts (SMF) (Docs. 38, 39). Cullison filed an opposing brief on October 11, 2011 (Doc. 46), together with a response to defendants' SMF and counter-statement of material  [*3] facts (Doc. 45), and forty-four exhibits with an appendix (Docs. 45-1 to 45-45). The County filed its reply brief on November 1, 2011 (Doc. 49).
The matter was referred to the undersigned magistrate judge for report and recommendation on September 7, 2011 (Doc. 40) and is now ripe for disposition.

Issues Presented
Defendants seek summary judgment on all claims, and present several issues for the consideration:
1. The FMLA claims against Donna Miller should be dismissed as she is not an "employer" under the Act.
2. Cullison is unable to establish a claim under the FMLA because:
a. His FMLA interference claim fails because he cannot show injury or prejudice.
b. Cullison's FMLA retaliation claim fails because he cannot establish a prima facie case by demonstrating a causal connection between his attempts to exercise FMLA rights and his termination.
3. The ADEA/PHRA age-discrimination claims fail because Cullison has not offered sufficient proof of age discrimination and, further, cannot demonstrate that defendants' reason for his termination is pretextual.
4. Cullison has not established his claims under the ADA/PHRA:
a. His disability discrimination claim fails because, even if Cullison established  [*4] a prima facie case, the County puts forth a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination, and Cullison cannot demonstrate pretext.
b. The failure-to-accommodate claim fails because the County provided Cullison with adequate accommodations.
5. Cullison is not entitled to punitive damages because they are unrecoverable as a matter of law.

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

I. Factual Background
In 2004, Cullison applied for the position of Part-Time Recyclable Material Collector for Dauphin County. (Docs. 39, 45 ¶¶ 30-31). He was interviewed by, and subsequently hired by, Wolf, the Director of the County's Department of Solid Waste Management and Recycling, who would be one of Cullison's supervisors. (Doc. 45-2 at 10:22-25). During the interview, Cullison told Wolf that he had "DVTs 1 [sic] in both legs" as well as a "back condition," but he didn't discuss with her how these conditions affected him. (Doc. 37-4 at 11).
On October 13, 2004, Cullison was hired as a part-time Recyclable Materials Collector by the Dauphin County Department of Solid Waste and Recycling. (Doc. 45-13 at 2). After working part-time for the County for two years, he transferred to a newly-created full-time position of Recycling Maintenance Worker. (Docs. 39, 45 ¶ 33; 45-13 at 9). At this time, he had no physical restrictions. (Docs. 39, 45 ¶ 37).
In September, 2006, Cullison was at work, pushing barrels up an incline, when he experienced severe stomach strains. (Docs. 39, 45 ¶ 65). Shortly afterward, Cullison gave the County a note from Dr. Don DeArmitt, M.D., dated September 20, 2006, stating: "Please amend Mr. Cullison's profile to state 'Limited walking of steps and inclines' and 'No pushing over 100 lb.'" (Doc. 45-13 at 30). Cullison was instructed by his supervisor to request inmate assistance to help  [*6] with duties he could not perform because of his restrictions. (Docs. 39, 45 ¶ 67). Of the hundred or so times that Cullison guessed that he requested inmate assistance, he says he received it about seventy-five times; he otherwise performed the duties in question himself. (Id. at ¶¶ 68-70). For any of those roughly twenty-five times he requested but received no inmates' assistance, he never reported to Wolf or anyone else at the County that the requested help never came. (Id. at ¶ 71).
In March 2008, Wolf asked Cullison to clean up a briar patch. (Id. at ¶ 72). He said he couldn't do that without assistance because of the DVT in his legs. (Id.). As of March 4, 2008, given Cullison's DVT, his assignment to clear a briar patch, and the danger he said that presented him, Cullison was told not to come to work. Schreiber testified that Miller and Wolf told Cullison not to work because of his medical condition. (Doc. 45-6 at 12:15-13:7). Wolf denied having anything to do with that decision. (Doc. 45-3 at 172:21-173:6). Miller, too, denied making such a decision, stating that Cullison's doctor, Dr. DeArmitt, as the one who that made the decision. (Doc. 45-4 at 21:21-22:5; 38:15-23). 2 Following  [*7] the County's receipt of the letter from Cullison's physician, he was instructed not to return to work until clarification was received as to what Cullison's functional restrictions were. (Doc. 45-4 at 22:9-15). 3 As a result, Cullison did not work from March 4 to April 9, 2008, a total of 184 hours. (Doc. 45-13 at 126). Cullison testified that, during this period, no one from Dauphin County ever told him that he could take FMLA leave or that he could possibly apply for unemployment compensation benefits. (Doc. 45-3 at 185:2-10).
After resolving the limitations issues, Miller 4 wrote Cullison a letter dated April 9, 2008, that it was "mandatory" for him to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) "at all times" while doing any outside garden or work "that could risk [his] health[.]" (Doc. 45-13 at 44). Cullison returned to work in the same position on April 10, 2008. (Doc. 45-13 at 126; Doc. 45 ¶ 81). 5 He contends, however, that "he was subjected to a series of [ongoing] harassment, including being denied pay, being written up for unwarranted reasons, being subject to discriminatory comments, and eventually fired." (Doc. 45, ¶ 81).
To accommodate Cullison's limitations, Dauphin County chose a Tyvek suit as an adequate form of PPE that would accommodate Cullison's sensitivity to briars and poison. (Id. at ¶ 83). The Tyvek suit went over Cullison's regular clothing. (Id. at ¶ 84). Cullison does not dispute that this suit adequately protected him from poison ivy and briars (Id. at ¶ 86), but objected to being the only employee in the  [*10] Department who had to wear the suit (Id. at ¶ 85). 6
Additionally, Cullison wanted a chair to be placed in the locker room shower so that he could put on the protective gear. (Id. at ¶ 87). Davies declined to allow Cullison to have a chair in the bathroom, as there was a couch and padded chair in the conference room that Cullison could use for changing. (Id. at ¶¶ 88, 89). Every time Cullison put a chair into the shower area, Davies took it back out again. (Id. at ¶ 88).
In late 2006, Davies issued a memorandum addressed to Cullison addressing automotive-accident procedures. (Doc. 45-13 at 109). This policy required that a police report be filed for any incident involving county vehicles, no matter how minor. (Id.) Dauphin County's own accident-report form also needed to be filled out as soon as possible following any such incident. (Id.).
Subsequently, the vehicle policy was revised as of April 15, 2009. (Doc.  [*11] 37-19 [hereinafter 2009 Vehicle Policy]). The new policy allows, in the event of an accident, twenty-four hours for the completion of a County auto-accident report and a police report, copies of which were required to be submitted to the County's Risk Management Department. (Doc. 37-19 at 6-78). According to the policy, police reports were necessary even if no one was hurt. (Id. at 7). If an employee driving a county vehicle were in an accident and found to be at fault, that employee would be responsible for the first $100 of the resulting cost. (Id.). However, employees were typically not disciplined under the 2009 vehicle policy if they took more than twenty-fours to turn in an accident-investigation form or failed to call the police after being in an accident, and Wolf testified that despite the policy's requirement that employees at fault in accidents had to pay the first $100 of the repair costs, this policy was not enforced during Cullison's employment. (Id. at ¶¶ 103-05).
On May 5, 2009, Cullison was driving his county-owned Ford pick-up truck when an accident occurred that resulted in the passenger-side mirror breaking. (Docs. 39, 45 ¶ 106). Cullison submitted a Vehicle Accident  [*12] Investigation Form the same day. (Id. at ¶ 107). The form indicates that at the time of the accident, Cullison was traveling eastbound on Route 283. (Doc. 45-28 at 2). It was 6:00 AM, and Cullison's report describes the conditions as rainy, wet, and dark. (Id. at 3). Cullison reported that a "bird (Hawk) struck pass[enger] side mirror & broke it." (Docs. 39, 45, ¶ 109, Doc. 45-28, at 2). Davies reviewed the report and signed off on it on the same date. (Doc. 45-28, Exhibit 27). Cullison testified in his deposition that after the accident, Jeffrey Karl, a fellow County employee, told Cullison that he had been following Cullison and saw something fall to the ground from Cullison's vehicle, but he could not identify the object. (Docs. 39, 45 ¶ 110).
The County conducted an investigation into Cullison's accident (Docs. 39, 45 ¶ 113). Davies took some photos of the mirror and sent them to Miller along with an email which stated, "You should have (finally) received the report from Steve's 'bird strike' incident . . . Anyway, I've attached a few photos that I took of the mirror that broke. It looks like he backed into a wall; the edge of the mirror is scraped up and the mirror frame was cracked.  [*13] . .". (Docs. 39, 45 ¶¶ 116-117). Davies testified that at the time he took the photographs, he saw no feathers in the mirror, but that at some point later, feathers appeared in the mirror. (Id. at ¶¶ 118-19).
Miller, who considered Cullison's original accident report incomplete, asked him to "fill out an actual step-by-step description of what happened," so he wrote and signed a one-page supplement to his May 5 accident report. (Doc. 45-4 at 64:3-17; Doc. 37-21). The supplement is undated, but in a different hand is written "Rec'd 5-13-09." (Id.)
The original report listed no witnesses, but the supplement mentioned that Jeffrey Karl said he saw the impact: "At the time I also contacted Jeff Karl . . . on my CB radio and ask[ed] him if he saw what struck my truck. He replied that he did not but he did see 'something flying to the ground off of it, but could not identify what the object was.'" (Id.) And in fact, on the same day that Cullison's supplemental was marked received, Karl sent an email to Donna Miller corroborating several details of Cullison's reports. 7
GPS tracking reports for Cullison's and Karl's vehicles were pulled. (Docs. 39, 45 ¶¶ 121-22). 8 Data from the GPS reports revealed discrepancies between where Cullison and Karl reported they were and the GPS location data for their vehicles. Wolf testified that the GPS report for Cullison's vehicle revealed that the accident could not have occurred where he said it did. Cullison's supplementary report gave the accident location somewhere between the Tollhouse Road and Elizabethtown exits on Route 283 East, but Wolf said that was impossible: "He never was between Toll House Road and Elizabethtown exit. He got off at the Toll House Road. The Elizabethtown exit is a few miles down the road." (Doc. 45-3, Ex. 2 at 237:2-7). The GPS records also revealed that, as long as Karl was actually in his vehicle at the time of the accident, he could not have been a witness.
Although the parties  [*15] dispute whether it was Wolf or Miller who fired Cullison, the evidence suggests that both may have played a part in the process. (See Doc. 45-4 at 12-13 (describing the working relationship between Miller and Wolf). On May 18, 2009, Miller wrote a letter on Dauphin County letterhead to Faye Fisher and Kelly Wolf:
As you can tell the information that Steve has provided is false and not accurate. Steve is not a credible employee. According to the employee handbook, page 33 section 12 any employee who provides false information and falsifys [sic] documents that are submitted for insurance purposes should be terminated.
(Doc. 45-37 at 2). Although he had never received any unsatisfactory performance ratings during his employment with the County, on May 20, 2009, the formal termination letter came, signed by "Kelly J. Wolf" as "Manager," and cited "providing false information" as the reason for termination. (Doc. 45-3 at 192:3-5). 9 After Cullison was fired, he was replaced by Zachary Noss, who was 19 years old and had no disability. (Doc. 45-17 at 4, 5; Doc. 45-16 at 7, 9). The present action followed.

II. Standard of review
Employment-discrimination cases are particularly difficult for an employer-movant to win on a summary-judgment motion, as "the burden of persuasion . . . remains unalterably on the employer as movant." Doe v. C.A.R.S. Prot. Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358, 361 (3d Cir. 2008). The employer's challenge is to persuade the court that even if all inferences that "could reasonably be drawn from the evidentiary materials of record . . . were viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, no reasonable jury could find in the plaintiff's favor." Id. (citing Sorba v. Penn. Drilling Co., Inc., 821 F.2d 200, 201-02 (3d Cir. 1987)). Even under the burden-shifting scheme so frequently applied in several  [*17] of the claims in this case, the employer's need to tip the scales of persuasion in its favor looms in the background.
The general standard of review for summary-judgment motions applies as well: under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), a court "shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed R. Civ. P. 56(a). "[T]his standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine [dispute] of material fact." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
A disputed fact is "material" if proof of its existence or nonexistence would affect the outcome of the case under applicable substantive law. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248; Gray v. York Newspapers, Inc., 957 F.2d 1070, 1078 (3d Cir. 1992). A dispute of material fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 257; Brenner v. Local 514, United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners of Am., 927 F.2d 1283, 1287-88 (3d Cir. 1991).
When  [*18] determining whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact, the court must view the facts and all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Moore v. Tartler, 986 F.2d 682 (3d Cir. 1993); Clement v. Consol. Rail Corp., 963 F.2d 599, 600 (3d Cir. 1992); White v. Westinghouse Elec. Co., 862 F.2d 56, 59 (3d Cir. 1988). In order to avoid or obtain summary judgment, however, parties may not rely on unsubstantiated allegations. Parties seeking to establish that a fact is or is not genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by "citing to particular parts of materials in the record," by showing that an adverse party's factual assertion lacks support from cited materials, or demonstrating that a factual assertion is unsupportable by admissible evidence. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (requiring evidentiary support for factual assertions made in response to summary judgment). The party opposing the motion "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Parties must produce evidence to show the existence  [*19] of every element essential to its case that they bear the burden of proving at trial, for "a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323; see Harter v. G.A.F. Corp., 967 F.2d 846, 851 (3d Cir. 1992). Failure to properly support or contest an assertion of fact may result in the fact being considered undisputed for the purpose of the motion, although a court may also give parties an opportunity to properly provide support or opposition. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).

III. Discussion

(A) Defendant Miller
Defendants first challenge Cullison's claims against Miller, asserting that she is entitled to summary judgment inasmuch as she is not an "employer" under the FMLA. In order for individual liability to attach, the FMLA requires that an individual must maintain control over the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment. See Kilvitis v. County of Luzerne, 52 F. Supp.2d 403, 413 (M.D. Pa.1999). Defendants maintain that Miller, the County Insurance and Safety Program Administrator for the risk management department, was not involved in either the FMLA leave or ADA accommodations.  [*20] Moreover, she was not Cullison's supervisor and had no authority to hire and fire.
Cullison contends, however, that Miller had control over the terms and conditions of his employment because she made determinations as to whether a person could perform the essential functions of a job. He also argues that Miller was the one who concluded he was unable to work for 28.5 days in March and April, 2008 and the she made the determination that he violated county policies, which she advised was a terminable offense.
Section 2611(4)(A)(ii)(I)'s inclusion of "any person who acts, directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer" plainly contemplates that liability for FMLA violations may be imposed upon an individual person who would not otherwise be regarded as the plaintiff's "employer." This has been interpreted to mean "that an individual is subject to FMLA liability when he or she exercises 'supervisory authority over the complaining employee and was responsible in whole or part for the alleged violation' while acting in the employer's interest." Haybarger v. Lawrence County Adult Probation and Parole, 667 F.3d 408, 417 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing Riordan v. Kempiners, 831 F.2d 690, 694 (7th Cir.1987)  [*21] (discussing individual liability under the FLSA's analogous definition of an "employer")).
In examining supervisory control over an employee under the FMLA, as well as the FLSA, most courts look to the "economic reality" of the employment situation, examining whether the individual supervisor carried out the functions of an employer with respect to the employee. 5 "[W]hether a person functions as an employer depends on the totality of the circumstances rather than on 'technical concepts of the employment relationship.'" Id. (citing Hodgson v. Arnheim & Neely, Inc., 444 F.2d 609, 612 (3d Cir. 1971).
Some of the relevant factors in ascertaining the economic reality of the employment situation include whether the individual "(1) had the power to hire and fire the employee [ ], (2) supervised and controlled employee work schedules or conditions of employment, (3) determined the rate and method of payment, and (4) maintained employment records." Herman v. RSR Security Services Ltd, 172 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 1999)  [*22] (quoting Carter v. Dutchess Cmty. Coll., 735 F.2d 8, 12 (2d Cir.1984)) (citation omitted). However, courts must consider "any relevant evidence" and "[n]o one of the four factors standing alone is dispositive." Id. (citing Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb, 331 U.S. 722, 730, 67 S. Ct. 1473, 91 L. Ed. 1772 (1947)).
Applying these factors to the present case, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Miller was Cullison's "employer." Although she may not have had the authority to hire or fire Cullison, Miller had a supervisory role over the terms or conditions of his employment. Miller testified that Cullison was not working in March and April, 2008 because defendants needed clarification from his physician as to the restrictions for his job. (Doc. 45-4, Ex. 3, p. 26:18-20 (deposition p. 25:18-20)). Further, although Miller testified that Cullison's physician, not she, made the decision that he was unable to perform his job in March and April, 2008 due to medical conditions, it was Miller who determined that Cullison could not perform the functions of his job safely. (Id. at 22:13-16 (deposition p. 21:13-16; 22:21-23:8 (deposition p. 21:21-22:8)).
Miller testified that she did not make the decision to fire Cullison,  [*23] nor did she consult about it with Wolf, who was his supervisor and the person who made the decision to terminate him. (Id. at 30:3-11 (deposition p. 29:3-11)). However, Miller did state that she provided Wolf with the "information on documentation from the accident" along with a letter concluding that documents were falsified, which would be grounds for termination. (Id. at 31:18-32:4 (deposition p. 20:18-31:4)).
While there is no evidence to support the third and forth factors, to wit., that Miller determined Cullison's rate or method of pay or maintained records, aside from insurance documents, relating to Cullison, nonetheless the factors are merely guiding and not controlling in ascertaining the economic reality of the employment situation. Therefore, viewing the totality of the circumstances, there in sufficient evidence for a fact-finder to conclude that Miller was Cullison's employer for purposes of FMLA liability. Consequently, Miller is not entitled to summary judgment on Counts I and II. 2

(B) FMLA
The FMLA was enacted to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of employers and to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons. 29 U.S.C. § 2601(b). To accomplish these goals, the act provides that an eligible employee is entitled to 12 work-weeks of leave during any given 12-month period for certain qualifying events, including a "serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). "Serious health condition," in turn, is broadly defined as an "illness, injury, impairment," or other physical or mental condition that "involves" either (a) inpatient care or (b) "continuing treatment by a health care provider." Id. §§ 2611 (11)(A), (B). The FMLA further entitles eligible employees to reinstatement at the end of FMLA leave to the position of employment held before leave or to an "equivalent position." 29 U.S.C. §§ 2614(a)(1)(A), (B). 6
There are two relatively distinct causes of action under the FMLA: (1) interference provisions declare it unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided in FMLA, and (2) the statute prohibits an employer from discriminating or retaliating against an employee for exercising rights under the FMLA. 29 U.S.C.A. § 2615(a) (1, 2). The complaint brings claims for both causes of action. See Hayduk v. City of Johnstown, 386 F. App'x. 55, 59 (3d Cir. 2010) (noting that an employee alleging a discharge in violation of the FMLA may proceed under both theories of recovery) (citing Erdman v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 582 F.3d 500, 509 (3d Cir.2009) (holding that "firing an employee for a valid request for FMLA leave may constitute interference with the employee's FMLA rights as well as retaliation against the employee" (footnote omitted)).

(1) Interference
The statute mandates that employers fully accord their employees the right to FMLA leave: "It shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,  [*26] any right provided under this subchapter." Id. § 2615(a)(1). The FMLA being a statute concerned with protecting employees' rights, it takes relatively little to trigger its FMLA protections. An employee need only show a failure to have received FMLA benefits that the employer had a duty to provide. Callison v. City of Philadelphia, 430 F.3d 117, 119 (3d Cir. 2005) (citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 2612(a), 2614(a)). Questions of discrimination have no bearing on an interference claim, which focuses solely on whether an employee receives FMLA-guaranteed benefits.
To state a claim for interference under the FMLA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she was an eligible employee under the FMLA; (2) the defendant was an employer subject to the FMLA's requirements; (3) the plaintiff was entitled to FMLA leave; (4) the plaintiff gave notice to the defendant of his or her intention to take FMLA leave; and (5) the plaintiff was denied benefits to which he or she was entitled under the FMLA. Johnson v. Community College of Allegheny County, 566 F. Supp.2d 405, 446 (W.D. Pa. 2008). An employee need not specifically mention the FMLA or assert rights under it to satisfy the notice requirement, but only state that  [*27] leave is needed. 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(c); Wilson v. Lemington Home for the Aged, 159 F. Supp.2d 186, 192 (W.D. Pa.2001).
Cullison argues that the defendants failed to provide him notice of his FMLA rights when he was unable to work for 28.5 days in March and April, 2008. Defendants argue that Cullison was not denied FMLA benefits. Rather, the county has a policy requiring an employee to first utilize accrued leave before the application of FMLA leave. 7 Such a policy is not inconsistent with the statute. See 29 U.S.C. § 2612(d)(2)(B) ("[a]n eligible employee may elect, or an employer may require the employee, to substitute any of the accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave, or medical or sick leave of the employee...."); Majewski v. Fischi, 372 F. App'x. 300, 305-06 (3d Cir. 2010) (finding plaintiff's use of any accrued sick and/or personal leave would not have impacted the statutorily required twelve weeks of FMLA leave that he received); Lynch v. Matthews Intern., No. 08-1717, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64261, 2010 WL 2640597, *5 (W.D. Pa. June 29, 2010) (employer's FMLA policies that required employee to use vacation days for medical absences did not run afoul of the FMLA);
Defendants further contend that Cullison cannot establish a claim for FMLA interference in the absence of any injury or prejudice. Although Cullison maintains that defendants' failure to ascertain their responsibilities under the FMLA constitutes a violation of the interference provisions, he fails to note that an injury to the plaintiff is required to establish such a violation. It is well-settled in the Third Circuit that a plaintiff may only "show an interference with his right to leave under the FMLA, within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1), if he is able to establish that this failure to advise [of his rights under the FMLA] rendered him unable to exercise that right in a meaningful way, thereby causing injury." Hofferica v. St. Mary Medical Center, 817 F. Supp.2d 569 (E.D. Pa. 2011) (quoting Conoshenti v. Public Service Electric & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 143 (3d Cir. 2004));  [*29] see also Fogleman v. Greater Hazleton Health Alliance, 122 F. App'x. 581, 587 (3d Cir.2004) ("Conoshenti held that an employer's failure to advise could constitute a violation of one's FMLA rights, but only if the employee could show resulting prejudice.").
Thus, even assuming that they did not apprise Cullison of his FMLA rights, defendants contend he cannot establish an FMLA interference claim because he is unable to demonstrate any injury or prejudice resulting therefrom. To state it another way, had Cullison been notified of his rights under the FMLA, the outcome would have been the same, i.e, his accrued leave time would have been applied to his absence. When the plaintiff has not presented any evidence that he could have made a different choice had the company informed him of his FMLA rights, he has not made a showing of prejudice. Conoshenti, supra at 145; see also Matthews v. New Jersey Institute of Technology, 772 F. Supp.2d 647, 658 (D.N.J. 2011) (plaintiff who claimed he was unaware of his FMLA failed to meet his burden of showing prejudice as there was no evidence that he would have done anything differently had he been informed of his FMLA rights); Yansick v. Temple University Health System, No. 04-4228, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53789, 2006 WL 2243178, *10 n.21 (E.D. Pa. July 27, 2006)  [*30] (noting a plaintiff's obligation to show that he was eligible for FMLA leave and that the alleged interference caused prejudice; interference alone, even a failure to advise, does not entitle a plaintiff to relief).
Accordingly, in the absence of any injury or prejudice to Cullison, no violation has been established. Summary judgment in favor of the defendants is, therefore, warranted on this issue.

(2) Retaliation
An FMLA retaliation claim is contemplated by section 825.220(c) 8 of the regulations implementing 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a). 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c) FN5; see Conoshenti, supra. To establish a prima facie case for retaliation under the FMLA, a plaintiff must show that (1) she took an FMLA leave, (2) she suffered an adverse employment decision, and (3) the adverse decision was causally related to her leave. Conoshenti, 364 F.3d at 146. Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason which provides a basis for plaintiff's discharge. McDonnell Douglas Corp. V. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). If the employer can meet this burden, then the burden shifts back to the employee to prove, by a preponderance  [*31] of the evidence, that the reasons articulated by the defendant were actually a pretext for discriminatory practices. Id. at 804. Summary judgment is appropriate on behalf of the employer if the employee fails to meet her burden at either the prima facie or pretext stage of the framework.
The first two elements are uncontested: Cullison took FMLA leave in March and April, 2008 and he suffered an adverse employment decision when he was fired in May, 2009. The parties dispute whether the third element — a causal relation between his leave and his dismissal — has been established.
With respect to the third  [*32] factor, Third Circuit cases focus on two main factors in determining whether there is a causal link in an FMLA retaliation claim — timing and evidence of ongoing antagonism. Abramson v. Wm. Patterson College of N.J., 260 F.3d 265, 288 (3d Cir.2001) ("Temporal proximity ... is sufficient to establish the causal link. [A] plaintiff can [also] establish a link between his or her protected behavior and subsequent discharge if the employer engaged in a pattern of antagonism in the intervening period."). "[T]he mere fact that adverse employment action occurs after [a protected activity] will ordinarily be insufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating a causal link between the two events." Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh, 120 F.3d 1286, 1302 (3d Cir.1997) (abrogated on other grounds, Burlington No. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006)). However, if "the timing of the alleged retaliatory action is 'unusually suggestive of retaliatory motive' a causal link will be inferred." Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 503 (3d Cir.1997). See also Pressley v. Johnson, 268 F. App'x 181, 185 (3d Cir.2008) ("for an inference of retaliation to be plausible, there must  [*33] not be a significant gap in time between the exercise of protected activity and the purported act of retaliation") (citing Black v. Lane, 22 F.3d 1395, 1407 (7th Cir.1994)). While temporal proximity may allow an inference of causal connection to be drawn, the lack of temporal proximity does not necessarily defeat the ability to demonstrate a causal connection. See Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d 271, 280-81 (3d Cir.2000) (if the timing of the events is not "unduly suggestive," the plaintiff can still show a causal link with other circumstantial evidence, such as evidence of ongoing antagonism or inconsistent reasons for terminating the employee).
Defendants argue that Cullison is unable to establish a causal connection between these two events given the time lapse of 13-14 months between their occurrences. Indeed, for a causal connection to be made, the temporal proximity between the occurrences has generally been in terms of hours or days, not months. See, e.g., Jalil v. Avdel Corp., 873 F.2d 701, 708 (3d Cir.1989) (holding that a causal link can be inferred where only two (2) days passed between the employee's protected activity and the adverse employment action); Whitman v. Proconex, Inc., No. 08-2667, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4016, 2009 WL 141847, at * 10-12 (E.D. Pa. Jan.20, 2009)  [*34] (finding that discharge within minutes of returning from FMLA leave was "unduly suggestive" of a causal link); Reinhart v. Mineral Techs. Inc., No. 05-4203, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89279, 2006 WL 4050695, at *10-11 (E.D. Pa. Nov.27, 2006) (finding that the decision to terminate an employee within twenty-four (24) hours after returning from his initial FMLA leave met "the bare minimum of sufficiency to establish causation"). The lapse between his leave in March and April, 2008 and his termination in May, 2009 is insufficient to establish a causal connection between the two events because they are too attenuated. See Williams v. Philadelphia Housing Authority Police Department, 380 F.3d 751, 760 (3d Cir.2004) (In the absence of very close temporal proximity suggestive of retaliation, additional evidence is required for a causal connection to be made.) Cullison has presented no other evidence to support the existence of a causal connection between his FMLA leave and his termination. Consequently, a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation has not been made. 9

(C) ADEA
Title VII prohibits discrimination against an individual on the basis of that individual's "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. Age is not a proscribed basis for discrimination under Title VII. Id. The ADEA, however, is the legislatively enacted provision that prohibits discrimination on the basis of an individual's age and it mirrors Title VII in its substantive provisions. See e.g., Ahlmeyer v. Nevada System of High Ed., 555 F.3d 1051, 1058 (9th Cir. 2009)  [*36] ("Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides an avenue for plaintiffs to assert claims for employment discrimination based on 'race, color, religion, sex or national origin ... In its substantive provisions, the ADEA mirrors Title VII...."). The PHRA likewise prohibits discrimination by employers on the basis of age. See 43 P.S. § 954(a). 10
In the absence of direct evidence, cases such as Cullison's are examined under the evidentiary framework first set forth by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). With respect to an allegation of age discrimination, under the McDonnell Douglas framework:
the plaintiff bears the burden of proof and the initial burden of production, having to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination by showing first, that the plaintiff is forty years of age or older; second, that the defendant took an adverse employment  [*37] action against the plaintiff; third, that the plaintiff was qualified for the position in question; and fourth, that the plaintiff was ultimately replaced by another employee who was sufficiently younger to support an inference of discriminatory animus. Once the plaintiff satisfies these elements, the burden of production shifts to the employer to identify a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. If the employer does so, the burden of production returns to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer's proffered rationale was a pretext for age discrimination. At all times, however, the burden of persuasion rests with the plaintiff.
Smith v. City of Allentown, 589 F.3d 684, 689-90 (3d Cir. 2009).
"If the employer offers evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision, the plaintiff must produce evidence 'from which a factfinder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer's action.'" Potoski v. Wilkes University, 692 F. Supp. 2d 475, 484 (M.D. Pa. 2010)  [*38] (Vanaskie, J.) (quoting Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994). To prevail on such a claim, the plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that age discrimination was the "but-for" cause of the challenged adverse employment action. Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2351, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009). See Henry v. Northern Westmoreland Career & Tech, Slip Copy, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31337, 2011 WL 1136792, * 9 (W.D. Pa. March 25, 2011); Akin v. York County Prison, No. 1:09-CV-2484, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56223, 2010 WL 2342502, *6 n.4 (M.D. Pa. June 8, 2010) (Rambo, J.) (observing that "[i]n Smith, the Third Circuit reaffirmed that the familiar McDonnell Douglas burden shifting framework applies in ADEA cases despite the Supreme Court's skepticism expressed in Gross"); Starceski v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 54 F.3d 1089, 1095 n. 4 (3d Cir.1995) ("Throughout this burden-shifting exercise, the burden of persuasion, 'including the burden of proving 'but for' causation or causation in fact, remains on the employee.'" (citing Tex. Dep't of Comm. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254-55, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). Although the prima facie inquiry need not adhere to a rigid formula, a plaintiff cannot shift the burden of production  [*39] to the defendant simply by expressing a subjective belief that the challenged employment action was motivated by his or her age. Wilson v. Blockbuster, Inc., 571 F. Supp. 2d 641, 647 (E.D. Pa. 2008).
Cullison has offered evidence to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. The undisputed factual averments demonstrate that Cullison meets the first two (2) elements of a prima facie case of age discrimination, to wit, that he is within the protected class, having been born in 1949 11 and that he was terminated from his position as a Recycling Maintenance Worker. Moreover, as to the third element, Cullison was presumably qualified for the position, having held it for approximately three (3) years. Finally, he was replaced by a person who was 19 years old, a factor which could lead a reasonable jury to infer discriminatory animus. See Sempier v. Johnson & Higgins, 45 F.3d 724, 729 (3d Cir. 1995) (as little as a five year age differential may suffice to raise an inference of age discrimination).
A prima facie case having been put forth, the burden shifts to the defendants to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for their actions. Defendants assert that the basis for terminating Cullison was the falsification of documents related to the broken side mirror of a county-owned vehicle. Accordingly, the burden shifts back to Cullison to establish that the reason proffered by defendant is pretextual. See e.g., Woodson v. Scott Paper Co., 109 F.3d 913, 920 n.2 (3d Cir.1997) (noting that the defendant's burden at this stage is relatively light and that it is satisfied if the defendant articulates a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action).
To rebut defendants' proffered reason and demonstrate pretext, Cullison must offer evidence "from which a fact finder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative  [*41] cause of the employer's action." Showalter v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 190 F.3d 231, 235 (3d Cir. 1999); Keller v. Orix Credit, 130 F.3d 1101, 1108 (3d. Cir. 1997). "To discredit the employer's proffered reason, the plaintiff cannot simply show that the employer's decision was wrong or mistaken . . . Rather, the non-moving plaintiff must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact finder could rationally find them 'unworthy of credence.'" Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765 (citation omitted). The court must then determine whether the plaintiff's evidence is sufficient "to permit a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the [employer's] reasons are incredible[.]" Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co., 100 F.3d 1061, 1072 (3d Cir. 1996).
To show that discrimination was more likely than not a cause for the employer's action (the second method of proving pretext), "the plaintiff must point to evidence with sufficient probative force that a factfinder could conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that" the plaintiff's age "was a motivating or determinative  [*42] factor in the employment decision." Simpson v. Kay Jewelers, Div. of Sterling, Inc., 142 F.3d 639, 644 (3d Cir.1998). Among other things, the plaintiff may show that the employer: (1) has previously discriminated against her; (2) has discriminated against other persons within the plaintiff's protected class or within another protected class; or (3) that the employer has treated more favorably similarly situated persons not within the protected class. Id. at 645 (citing Fuentes). The burden of proving pretext is a difficult one. Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765.
Cullison argues that remarks made by Wolf suggest an age-related bias that may have influenced the decision to terminate him. Cullison testified that in December, 2008, Wolf stated that the County was going to hire a young, physically-fit person for the position of warehouse worker. (Docs. 39, 45 ¶ 152). Cullison further testified that Wolf told him not to apply because he could retire at age 60. (Id. at ¶ 153). Cullison also stated that neither Wolf nor any other person made comments that he felt were discriminatory based on his age. (Doc. 39 ¶ 155; Doc. 37-4, p. 43:15-25 (deposition p. 198:15-25)). 12
Statements or comments by others in the workplace may demonstrate discriminatory intent, and thus the court is required to distinguish between those statements that are truly evidence of the employer's intent and those that are merely "stray remarks." Lloyd v. Washington & Jefferson College, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39118, 2007 WL 1575448 at *20 (W.D. Pa. May 30, 2007), aff'd, 288 F. App'x. 786 (3d Cir.2008) (citing Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 277, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1989)).  [*44] In order to differentiate, the following factors have been utilized: (1) who made the remark, i.e., a decision-maker, a supervisor, or a low-level co-worker; (2) when the remark was made in relation to the employment decision at issue; (3) the content of the remark, i.e., whether a reasonable juror could view the remark as discriminatory; and (4) the context in which the remark was made, i.e., whether it was related to the decision-making process. Id. (citing Pronin v. Raffi Custom Photo Lab., Inc., 383 F. Supp.2d 628, 637-38 (S.D.N.Y.2005)). Further, "stray remarks by decision makers, unrelated to the decision-making process, are rarely given weight, particularly if they are made temporally remote from the date of the decision." Silver v. American Inst. of Certified Public Accountants, 212 F. App'x. 82, 85 (3d Cir.2006) (citing Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, 983 F.2d 509, 545 (3d Cir.1992).
Defendants submit that even if the isolated remarks attributed to Wolf had been made, they are insufficient to cast doubt on its decision to terminate Cullison for making false statements. See Logan v. Countrywide Home Loans, No. 04-5974, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20088, 2007 WL 879010, *8 (E.D. Pa. March 15, 2007)  [*45] (remarks "too stray and too remote from the [termination] decision to support a reasonable indirect inference of age discrimination" as a motivation for termination) (quoting Sosky v. Int'l Mill Serv., Inc., No. 94-2833, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 791, 1996 WL 32139, at *8 (E.D. Pa. Jan.24, 1996). The evidence is clear that the remark is not only isolated, but also that it was remote, having been made approximately five months before he was terminated and unrelated to the decision-making process. Additionally, neither the context not the content of the remark clearly indicate an age-related bias as to Cullison's employment. Consequently, it is insufficient to establish pretext.
Moreover, inasmuch as Wolf was the person who made both the decision to hire Cullison as well as the decision to fire him, defendants contend there is a presumption against a discriminatory animus being drawn. Indeed, the Third Circuit has noted that such evidence, while not dispositive, may be relevant to show that no discrimination occurred. See Waldron v. SL Indus., Inc., 56 F.3d 491, 496 n. 6 (3d Cir.1995) (noting that in some circumstances, it may be appropriate to apply the Fourth Circuit's logic that a strong inference for non-discrimination  [*46] exists where the same actor took both positive and adverse employment actions against plaintiff); Mease v. Wilmington Trust Co., 726 F. Supp.2d 429, 441 n. 19 (D. Del. July 29, 2010) (pretext not shown where person who terminated plaintiff was the same person who promoted him).
Additionally, statements made by Zapata that his father "could ride circles around" Cullison are not material to this claim not only because Cullison testified that he considered no other remarks, aside from the one made by Wolf, as discriminatory based on age but also because it was neither made by a decision-maker nor was it related to the decision-making process. Instead, it was made by made by a low-level co-worker who meant it as a reflection on Cullison's effort, not age. (Doc. 45-7, p. 31 (deposition p. 30)).
Accordingly, Cullison has failed to meet his burden of establishing that the reason put forth by the defendants for his termination, to wit., falsifying records, is pretextual for age discrimination. 13 Summary judgment in favor of the defendants is, therefore, recommended on this claim.

(D) ADA/PHRA

(1) Discrimination
Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 in an effort to prevent otherwise qualified individuals from being discriminated against in employment based on disability. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630. The ADA provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must present evidence that: (1) he has a "disability" within the meaning of the ADA; (2) he was qualified for the position, with or without accommodation; and (3) he suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of the discrimination. Shaner v. Synthes, 204 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir.2000);  [*48] Deane v. Pocono Medical Center, 142 F.3d 138, 142 (3d Cir.1998) (en banc).
The Act defines a "qualified individual with a disability" as "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that individual holds or desires." Id at § 12111(8). An employer discriminates against a qualified individual when it does "not mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of the individual unless the [employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the [employer]." Id. at § 12112(b)(5)(A). "Reasonable accommodation" means measures such as "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, ... and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." Id. at § 12111(9).
The parties agree that a prima facie case of disability discrimination can be established. Accordingly, the burden shifts to the defendants to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action(s). As noted above, Defendants assert  [*49] that the basis for terminating Cullison was the falsification of documents related to the broken mirror of his vehicle. Therefore, the burden shifts back to Cullison to establish that the reason proffered by defendant is pretextual. Cullison identifies the following points in support of his pretext argument: (1) defendants, through Wolf, testified that Cullison did not lie on the May, 2009 accident report; (2) that there were similarly situated employees who were treated more favorably; and (3) defendants failed to follow county policy as to disciplinary action.
In her deposition testimony, Wolf stated that the time, location and cause of the May, 2009 accident as reported by Cullison were not accurate. Although at one point in her testimony, Wolf declined to characterize the mistake as a lie, the substance of Wolf's testimony clearly indicates she considered Cullison's report of the accident to be false. See Doc. 45-3, p. 130-134 (deposition p. 235-239). Cullison mischaracterizes Wolf's testimony on this issue as inconsistent with the termination letter, which stated that the reason for his dismissal was document falsification. Both the dismissal letter and Wolf's testimony consistently  [*50] assert that the defendants considered Cullison's representation of the accident to be inaccurate and contrary to other evidence. Accordingly, there is no inconsistency between his termination letter and Wolf's testimony upon which to base a pretext argument.
Cullison also contends that there are similarly-situated employees who were treated more favorably than he but that those individuals were not disabled, suggesting the reason behind the differential treatment was a discriminatory motive. The persons Cullison identifies as similarly-situated but treated more favorably than he are: Jeff Karl, 14 Hugo Zapata, 15 Roger Thebes, Donna Miller and Matt Davies. 16 Defendants argue, however, that these individuals are improper comparators because they are not similarly-situated to Cullison. Specifically, they assert that none of these individuals were accused of committing the offense for which Cullison was terminated — document falsification concerning a accident in a county vehicle — nor engaged in such behavior and were not terminated.
"In order for employees to be deemed similarly situated, it has been determined 'that the individuals with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare [his] treatment must have dealt with the same supervisor, have been subject to the same standards, and have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them for it.'" Ogden v. Keystone Residence, 226 F. Supp.2d 588, 603 (M.D. Pa. 2002) (emphasis added) (quoting Morris v. G.E. Financial Assurance Holdings, Civ. A. No. 00-3849, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20159, 2001 WL 1558039, at *6 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 5, 2001) (citations omitted)) (alteration in original). See also Bullock v. Children's Hosp. of Phila., 71 F. Supp.2d 482, 489 (E.D. Pa. 1999);  [*52] Opsatnik v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 335 F. App'x. 220, 223 (3d Cir. 2007) ( "While 'similarly situated' does not mean identically situated, the plaintiff must nevertheless be similar in 'all relevant respects.") (quoting Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997)); see Lepore v. Lanvision Sys., Inc., 113 F. App'x. 449, 452 (3d Cir. 2004) (opining that similarly situated employees "work in the same area in approximately the same position") (citing Anderson v. Conrail, 297 F.3d 242, 249-50 (3d Cir. 2002).
Cullison cites the alleged conduct of these individuals as similar to his yet these individuals were not terminated. However, as noted by defendants, none of these individuals is accused of having falsified documents relating to an accident in a county-owned vehicle. Cullison himself does not allege these individuals engaged in such behavior. Rather, he contends that they engaged in the following behaviors: failing to turn in accident reports within 24 hours or failing to include/attach a police report; failing to call the police (presumably with respect to an auto accident in a county-owned vehicle); turning in an insurance claim without a police report; failing to sign  [*53] a report; failing to pull GPS records with respect to other employees/accidents; failing to submit police reports or vehicle accident reports; overpayment of wages; and unauthorized use of a county-owned vehicle. These actions, although potentially improper and noncompliant with county policy, are neither as serious nor sufficiently similar to document falsification regarding a accident in a county-owned vehicle so as to be proper comparisons to Cullison's actions which form the basis for his discharge. See Newring v. PNC Corp., No. 01-1973, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18136, 2006 WL 840347, *9 (W.D. Pa. March 28, 2006) ("To be similarly situated, employees must have engaged in the same behavior[.]") Consequently, an inference of discrimination cannot be drawn thereon.
Finally, Cullison maintains that the county failed to follow its own policies in terminating him. As noted above, the county had an employee handbook which provided the following disciplinary measures may be issued with respect to employee behavior or performance: (1) verbal reprimand; (2) written reprimand; (3) suspension; or (4) discharge. (Doc. 42-27, Ex. 26, p. 38 (county handbook p. 33)). The policy further provides that discharge may be recommended  [*54] "after a conscientious attempt to correct deficient areas or violations." Id.
However, the policy does not state that these different disciplinary measures must be followed sequentially. Accordingly, is does not appear that there has been violation of the county policy with respect to disciplinary action. Defendants correctly observe, moreover, that a failure to follow an internal disciplinary procedures does not suggest either a discriminatory intent or pretext, absent evidence of similarly-situated individuals who were treated differently with respect to such policies. Russell v. Vanguard Group, No. 04-3269, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50315, 2006 WL 2077010, *3 (E.D. Pa. July 24, 2006) (while employer's violation of its own policy "might afford evidence that improper purposes are playing a role," such a violation does not necessarily constitute evidence of pretext)(citing Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 267, 97 S. Ct. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977)); Sidique v. University of Pittsburgh Dept. of Dermatology, No. 02-365, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20473, 2003 WL 22290334, *7 (W.D. Pa. Oct. 3, 2003) (no basis for concluding that the alleged violations of internal policy prejudiced plaintiff more than others nor was there any evidence allowing a reasonable  [*55] inference that the alleged violations were used to mask discriminatory animus); Maull v. Division of State Police, 39 Fed. Appx. 769, 2002 WL 1480774, *4 (3d Cir. 2002) ("simply pointing to violations [of internal policy] is inadequate without evidence that [non-protected applicants] were treated differently by [the] Defendants with respect to [the] policies" than protected members.). Having concluded that no similarly-situated employees have been established as proper comparators, Cullison has also failed to establish pretext suggesting a discriminatory motive with respect to the application of policies outlined in the Department's employee handbook.
Inasmuch as Cullison has failed to meet his burned of establishing pretext with respect to his claim of disability discrimination, summary judgment in favor of defendants is recommended on this claim.

(2) Failure to Accommodate
"Under the ADA, once an individual is unable to perform the essential functions of the position . . . the inquiry shifts to whether reasonable accommodations can be made which would allow the individual to perform those essential functions." Freeman v. Rollins Envtl. Servs. of New Jersey, No. Civ. A. 94-1871, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11585, 1996 WL 451317, at *6 (D.N.J. Aug. 5, 1996)  [*56] (citing Milton v. Scrivner, 53 F.3d 1118, 1123 (10th Cir. 1995)). An employer discriminates against a qualified individual when the employer does "not make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of the individual unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer." Taylor v. Phoenixville School District, 184 F.3d 296, 306 (3d Cir.1999) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)).
Reasonable accommodations include "measures such as 'job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules ... acquisition or modification of equipment or devices ... and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.'" Freeman v. Chertoff, 604 F. Supp. 2d 726, 734 (D.N.J.2009) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B)). When making an accommodation claim, "[a]n employee can succeed . . . only if the employee can demonstrate that a specific, reasonable accommodation would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job." Donahue v. Consol. Rail Corp., 224 F.3d 226, 232 (3d Cir.2000) (internal citations and quotations omitted). If the plaintiff makes this showing, the burden shifts  [*57] to the defendant to prove that the requested accommodations "are unreasonable, or would cause an undue hardship on the employer." Turner v. Hershey Chocolate U.S.A., 440 F.3d 604, 614 (3d Cir.2006). Generally, the question of whether a proposed accommodation is reasonable is a question of fact. See Buskirk v. Apollo Metals, 307 F.3d 160, 170-71 (3d Cir.2002) (citing Hovsons, Inc. v. Township of Brick, 89 F.3d 1096, 1101 (3d Cir.1996)).
Additionally, "[a]n employee can demonstrate that an employer breached its duty to provide reasonable accommodations because it failed to engage in good faith in the interactive process by showing that: (1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; (2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; (3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and (4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith." Colwell v. Rite Aid Corp., 602 F.3d 495, 504 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing Williams, 380 F.3d at 761 (additional citations omitted). However:
[W]hile "an employer who fails to engage in the interactive process runs a serious  [*58] risk that it will erroneously overlook an opportunity to accommodate a statutorily disabled employee, and thereby violate the ADA," Deane v. Pocono Med. Ctr., 142 F.3d 138, 149 (3d Cir.1998) (en banc), failure to engage in the interactive process, in itself, does not constitute such a violation. See Shapiro v. Twp. of Lakewood, 292 F.3d 356, 359 (3d Cir.2002); Mengine, 114 F.3d at 420-21; see also Pathmark Stores, 177 F.3d at 193 (noting that "an employer [who acts on the belief that a perceived disability inherently precludes performance of the essential functions of a job, with or without accommodation] is failing to make an individualized determination, as the ADA requires, and thus acts at its peril," as "the employer must be correct about the affected employee's ability to perform the job in order to avoid liability").
Hohider v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 574 F.3d 169, 194 (3d. Cir. 2009).
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has adopted a "middle course" on the burdens of production and persuasion on the issues of reasonable accommodation and undue hardship. Bisker v. GGS Information Services, Inc., No. 1:07-CV-1465, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, 2010 WL 2265979, *2 (M.D. Pa. June 2, 2010). First, the plaintiff  [*59] bears the initial burden of proving that "she is otherwise qualified; if an accommodation is needed, the plaintiff must show, as part of her burden of persuasion, that an effective accommodation exists that would render her otherwise qualified." Id. (quoting Walton v. Mental Health Ass'n of Southeastern Pennsylvania, 168 F.3d 661, 670 (3d Cir.1999)). With respect to a reasonable accommodation, the plaintiff is required only to "identify[] an accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceeds its benefits." Id. (quoting Walton, supra). Once the plaintiff has met this requirement, the burden shifts to the defendant "to prove either that the accommodation is unreasonable or that it creates an undue hardship for the defendant." Id. (quoting Walton, supra).
Defendants contend that they continually provided Cullison with reasonable accommodations. For instance, Cullison was provided a Tyvek suit as protective gear and he also had a couch and chair available in the conference room to assist him in donning and doffing this equipment. Cullison was also afforded the assistance of inmates in lifting and pushing tasks for which he had medical restrictions. 17
Although the amended complaint alleges that defendants failed to make reasonable accommodations and to engage in the interactive process, Cullison does not address this claim in his opposition brief. Therefore, to the extent Cullison has not contested defendants' position by addressing the issue in his brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, he is deemed to have waived any challenge thereto. See M.D. Pa. L.R. 7.6. Inasmuch as the evidence presented indicates that defendants reasonable accommodated Cullison's disabilities, defendants are, consequently, entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

(E) Punitive Damages
Finally, defendants challenge Cullison's ability to recover punitive damages in this cause of action. The argue that punitive damages are not available for either Cullison's FMLA claims nor for his section §1983 claims. Indeed, the FMLA explicitly sets forth in § 2617(a) the types of damages recoverable,  [*61] and does not include punitive damages. See 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a) (2006). Pennsylvania courts have also interpreted the FMLA as disallowing punitive damages. Spain v. Colonial Penn Ins., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19788, 1997 WL 773053, at * 2-3 (E.D. Pa. Dec.12, 1997) (granting motion to dismiss requested punitive damages, noting that "a plaintiff may not recover punitive damages under the FMLA, and nothing [a] plaintiff pleads, however true, will alter that."). See also Brown v. Nutrition Mgmt. Services Co., No. 06-2034, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5580, 2009 WL 222352, at *3-4 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 26, 2009), aff'd in relevant part, 370 F. App'x 267, 270 (3d Cir. Mar. 17, 2010) (no recovery of compensatory or punitive damages under FMLA); Gagliardo v. Connaught Laboratories, Inc., 311 F.3d 565, 570 (3d Cir.2002) (punitive damages not available under PHRA); Kozempel v. Grand View Hosp., No. 10-6839, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34843, 2011 WL 1196851 (E.D. Pa. March 30, 2011); McKeirnan v. Smith-Edwards-Dunlap Co., No. 95-1175, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6822, 1995 WL 311393, at * 6 (E.D. Pa. May 17, 1995) ("The FMLA does not provide for punitive damages."). Additionally, defendant correctly observe that punitive damages are not recoverable against a governmental entity or its agents in a §1983 action. City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 101 S. Ct. 2748, 69 L. Ed.2d 616 (1981)  [*62] (absent a statute to the contrary, punitive damages cannot be awarded against a government entity); Walker v. North Wales Borough, 395 F. Supp.2d 219, 229 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (Punitive damages may not be awarded against governmental entities or against an officer acting in his or her official capacity).
Moreover, to the extent Cullison has not contested defendants' position by addressing the issue in his brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, he is deemed to have waived any challenge thereto. See M.D. Pa. L.R. 7.6. Consequently, the claim for punitive damages should be stricken.

IV. Conclusion
Accordingly, it is recommended that this defendants' motion for summary judgment be granted.
