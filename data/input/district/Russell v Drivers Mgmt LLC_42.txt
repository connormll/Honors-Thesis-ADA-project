RULING ON MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (DOC. NO. 37)

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff, Kenneth Russell ("Russell"), worked as a truck driver for defendant, Drivers Management, LLC ("Drivers Management"), from March 2016 until June 2017. In May 2017, Russell, who has high blood pressure, requested medical leave to visit a doctor. His employment with Drivers Management ended shortly thereafter. Russell alleges that Drivers Management violated his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act ("CFEPA"), and the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). See Compl. (Doc. No. 1).
Drivers Management has moved for summary judgment on all counts. See Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. No. 37); Sealed Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. No. 39). For the reasons below, the Motion for Summary Judgement is denied in part and [*2]  granted in part.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Kenneth Russell began working for Drivers Management on March 18, 2016. Def.'s Local Rule 56(a)(1) Statement of Undisputed Facts ("Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement") (Doc. No. 39-3) ¶ 1; Pl.'s Local Rule 56(a)(2) Statement of Undisputed Facts ("Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement") (Doc. No. 48-2) ¶ 1.1 He worked as a truck driver. Id. That position requires "knowledge of all applicable Department of Transportation ("DOT") and Motor Carrier Safety Regulations," the ability to "[m]eet all standards (medical, safety, etc.) required by the DOT," and satisfactory performance on various "driver physicals." Id. ¶ 2-3.
Russell has high blood pressure, of which Drivers Management was aware. Id. ¶ 4. He takes a medication called Amlodipine to treat his high blood pressure. Id. In March 2016, Russell underwent a physical exam, and the examiner noted that that Amlodipine "adequately controls" Russell's blood pressure. Id. ¶ 5.
On May 18, 2017, Russell informed his supervisor, Marcus Tomyn ("Tomyn"), that he was not feeling well and needed to visit a doctor. Id. ¶ 7. Russell told Tomyn he had a doctor's appointment the next day. Id. ¶ 8. Drivers Management's policy is to provide 30 days of medical leave, regardless of whether the [*3]  leave may qualify for FMLA protection. Id. ¶ 10. In compliance with that policy, Tomyn gave Russell the day of May 19 off. Id. ¶ 11. Tomyn also reminded Russell that Russell would need to complete a medical release and be cleared to return to work after he received his medical treatment. Id. ¶ 9.
On May 19, 2017, Russell saw Dr. Mandelberg. Id. ¶ 12. At the time, Russell's blood pressure was high. Id. ¶ 13. Russell explained that he had run out of Amlodipine a week prior and had not taken the medication since that time. Id. ¶ 14. The treating nurse advised him that he should not stop taking his medication in that manner, id. ¶ 15, and Dr. Mandelberg's office refilled his prescription for Amlodipine, id. ¶ 16. Russell was given a note that stated that he could return to work on May 24, 2017. Id.
Russell told Tomyn that he intended to visit another doctor. Id. ¶ 19. On May 24, 2017, Russell went to the Eastern Connecticut Health Network Manchester Memorial Hospital. Id. ¶ 20. There, he received another note releasing him to return to work on Friday, May 26, 2017. Id. ¶ 22. He did not return to work on May 26. Id. ¶ 23.
On May 30, Tomyn contacted Russell. Id. Russell did not give Tomyn an [*4]  anticipated return date. Id. Tomyn requested that Russell remove his belongings from his truck and return the keys. Id. ¶ 24. The parties dispute the meaning of that request. Drivers Management's Employee Relations coordinator, Patti Anderson, testified that Drivers Management has a general practice of asking employees to clean out their trucks if they will be on leave for any extended period of time. Id. ¶ 26. She testified that such a request does not mean that the employee is terminated but rather is intended to keep the truck in service until the employee returns. Id. ¶ 27. Russell states that Drivers Management does not have such a policy. Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)(2) Statement ¶¶ 26-27.
On May 31, 2017, Russell called the Veterans' Affairs Call Center, complaining of high blood pressure and noting that he was drinking alcohol more than usual. Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement ¶¶ 28-29. On June 2, 2017, Russell, on the instructions of the Call Center, visited the Veterans' Affairs Substance Abuse Disorder Outpatient Clinic. Id. ¶ 30-35. He was diagnosed with "Alcohol Abuse Disorder." Id. ¶¶ 35-36. On June 3, Russell visited his primary care physician, Dr. Santosh Doddamane. Id. ¶ 38. Dr. Doddamane advised Russell that [*5]  drinking alcohol while taking Amlodipine may "fight[ ] against the Amlodipine" and prevent the medication from controlling Russell's high blood pressure. Id. ¶ 40.
On Dr. Doddamane's recommendation, Russell checked into the Stonington Institute on June 3, 2017, for alcohol detoxification treatment. Id. ¶ 43-47. Before checking in for detoxification treatment, Russell called a Drivers Management employee named Kyle to inform him that he would continue to be absent from work. Id. ¶ 45. Russell remained in treatment at the Stonington Institute until June 8, 2017. Id. Although Russell admits these facts, he states that his "alcohol use did not prevent him from safely operating his truck." Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)(2) Statement ¶¶ 37, 39, 42, 44.
Russell states that he contacted Tomyn upon his June 8 discharge from detoxification treatment. Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement ¶ 49. According to Russell, Tomyn inquired whether Russell was ready to return to work. Id. ¶ 50. Russell said he was. Id. Russell called Tomyn again the next day, June 9. Id. During their conversation, Tomyn asked Russell to clean out his truck. Id. ¶ 51. Based on that conversation, Russell concluded that his employment had been terminated. Id. ¶ 52. The [*6]  next day, Russell cleaned most of his personal belongings out of the truck. Id. ¶ 53.
Russell returned to work again a few days later and saw that the truck he normally drove had been moved. Id. ¶ 56. He contacted Drivers Management's Safety Department and confirmed that another employee was driving his route. Id. ¶ 57. Russell contacted Tomyn, and Tomyn told him that Drivers Management "couldn't leave your truck here because it was costing . . . too much money to have the truck sitting there when we could be moving loads with it, so we had to reassign it." Id. ¶ 58. At this point, Russell believed his employment was terminated. Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)(2) Statement ¶ 59; see also Def.'s Ex. 1, Russell Dep. Russell also states that he believed he was terminated because he was locked out of Drivers Management's messaging system, which he tried to access a few days after Tomyn's request that he clean out his truck. Id.
A few days after his conversation with Tomyn, Russell received a letter from Patti Anderson, Drivers Management's Employee Relations coordinator, stating that he may qualify for FMLA leave. Id. ¶ 60-61; Def.'s Ex. 18 (letter from Patti Anderson, dated June 8, 2017). Although the letter requested [*7]  a response within 15 days and included Anderson's phone number, Russell never completed the FMLA certification or contacted Anderson. Id. ¶ 63. Anderson sent Russell a second letter, dated June 19, 2017, reminding Russell that he may be eligible for FMLA leave and requesting that he provide a certification form on or before June 29, 2017. Id. ¶¶ 64-65; Def.'s Ex. 19 (letter from Patti Anderson, dated June 19, 2017). Russell never returned the FMLA certification or any other documentation indicating that he could return to work. Id. ¶ 70. Anderson converted Russel's employment status to "voluntarily resigned" when he failed to return from medical leave. Id. ¶ 71.
Russell received treatment for Alcohol Abuse Disorder through the Veterans Affairs' Substance Abuse Dependence Program throughout June 2017 and continued to receive such treatment until June 2018. Id. ¶¶ 72-78. Again, Russell states that his struggle with alcohol did not prevent him from being able to perform the essential functions of his job with Drivers Management. Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)(2) Statement at 5.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
A motion for summary judgment may be granted only where the moving party can establish that there is no genuine dispute [*8]  as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). To avoid summary judgment, the nonmoving party "must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial," Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256, and present "such proof as would allow a reasonable juror to return a verdict in [its] favor," Graham v. Long Island R.R., 230 F.3d 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2000). In assessing the record to determine whether there are disputed issues of material fact, the trial court must "resolve all ambiguities and draw all inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought." LaFond v. Gen. Physics Servs. Corp., 50 F.3d 165, 175 (2d Cir. 1995). If, however, there is an "absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case," the moving party is entitled to summary judgment. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).
The Second Circuit has "emphasized 'the need for caution about granting summary judgment to an employer in a discrimination case where, as here, the merits turn on a dispute as to the employer's intent.'" Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 137 (2d Cir. 2008)). Because direct evidence of discriminatory intent "will rarely be available," "affidavits and depositions must be carefully scrutinized for circumstantial proof which, if believed, would show discrimination." Holcomb, 521 F.3d at 137 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Still, even in the discrimination context, [*9]  the party resisting summary judgment must provide more than conclusory allegations and show more than "some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Gorzynski, 596 F.3d at 101 (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)).

IV. DISCUSSION
Russell's Complaint contains eight counts, alleging: disability discrimination under the ADA (Count One), disability discrimination under the CFEPA (Count Two), failure to accommodate under the ADA (Count Three), failure to accommodate under the CFEPA (Count Four), retaliation under the ADA (Count Five), retaliation under the CFEPA (Count Six), interference under the FMLA (Count Seven), and retaliation under the FMLA (Count Eight). See Compl. Drivers Management seeks summary judgment on all counts. See Mot. for Summ. J.
A. Disability Discrimination2
Disability-discrimination claims under the ADA are subject to the burden-shifting analysis established in McDonnell-Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under that analysis, a plaintiff is first required to establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that "(1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation; [*10]  and (4) he suffered adverse employment action because of his disability." McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006) (quotation marks omitted)); see also Stevens v. Rite Aid Corp., 851 F.3d 224, 229 (2d Cir. 2017). Drivers Management does not contest the first two elements. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 22.
Drivers Management argues that Russell cannot prove his disability discrimination claims because he cannot establish the third or fourth elements of his prima facie case; that is, that he cannot establish that he "suffered adverse employment action because of his disability," and that he cannot establish that he was "otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 125; see Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. No. 39-1) at 22-28, 30-31. Russell argues that he did suffer an adverse employment action, because he "was terminated on or about June 9, 2017." Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. No. 48-1) at 19. Russell also argues that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job because he had passed his DOT-mandated medical exams and "simply needed a finite medical leave of absence to overcome symptoms of his disability." Id. at 18.
1. Adverse Employment Action
The parties dispute whether Russell "suffered an adverse employment action because [*11]  of his disability." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 125. Drivers Management argues that Russell "voluntarily resigned" from his work, and the company changed his employment status to reflect that voluntary resignation when he failed to return from medical leave. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 27-28; Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement ¶¶ 63-70. Russell argues that he was terminated on June 9, 2017, when Tomyn told him to "clean out his truck" after Russell said he was ready to return to work. Id. ¶¶ 50-52. In Russell's view, later events—such as the fact that he was locked out of Drivers Management's messaging system and that his route was reassigned to another driver—confirmed his view that he had been terminated. Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. at 6-7; see also Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)(2) Statement ¶ 59; Russell Dep. at 188-192.
Russell's statements in his deposition are sufficient to raise a question of fact as to whether he suffered an adverse employment action. Drivers Management argues that Russell's view that he was terminated is a mere "inference" or "speculation about the concealed meaning of [Tomyn's] comment," which is insufficient to defeat summary judgment. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 27 (citing McAllister v. Price Rite, No. 09-cv-1888 (VLB), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131500, 2013 WL 5187036, at *11-12 (D. Conn. Sept. 13, 2013) [*12]  and Arch. Ins. Co. v. Centerplan Constr. Co., LLC, 368 F. Supp.3d 350, 377 (D. Conn. 2019)). However, in the cases Drivers Management cites, the plaintiffs failed to submit "any competent evidence to the Court" in support of their positions. McAllister, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131500, 2013 WL 5187036 at *12; see also Arch. Ins. Co., 368 F. Supp. 3d at 377 (explaining that an "opinion unsupported by any facts is not evidence of . . . bad faith; it is merely a conclusory label devoid of factual content insufficient to surmount summary judgment.") Here, Russell stated in his deposition that he believed Tomyn's instruction to "clean out his truck" meant that Russell had been terminated and offered other examples that supported his view. See Russell Dep. at 188-192. For example, Russell testified that he had never seen another driver clean out his truck because it was not being used, id. at 189; that he was unable to access the messaging system, id. at 191; and that he was told his route was reassigned to another driver, id. at 191-92. Further, despite Drivers Management's statement that their policy is to "ask[] employees to clean out their trucks if and when the employee will be on leave for any extended period of time," Tomyn asked Russell to "clean out his truck" after Russell stated that he was ready to return to work. Id. ¶ 26 (emphasis added); id. ¶¶ 50-51. Although Russell's evidence is [*13]  by no means overwhelming, the court cannot conclude that there is an "absence of evidence in the record" to support Russell's position, or that a reasonable juror could not resolve the question of whether Russell suffered an adverse employment action in Russell's favor. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325; see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52 (describing the ultimate inquiry at the summary judgment stage, as on a motion for directed verdict, as "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.")
Further, Drivers Management argues that there is no evidence the adverse action was taken "because of" Russell's disability, that is, his high blood pressure. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 28. It argues that there is no basis to conclude that, having known of Russell's high blood pressure since the beginning of his employment, Drivers Management "suddenly developed a discriminatory animus in June 2017." Id. However, shortly after Russell first took time off due to complications relating to his high blood pressure, Russell was told to "clean out his truck," locked out of the Drivers Management messaging system, and told that his route [*14]  had been reassigned to another driver. Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement ¶¶ 50-59. As discussed above, a reasonable juror could conclude that Russell was terminated and that that adverse action occurred about three weeks after Russell first took time off to visit a doctor. See Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement, ¶¶ 7-8, 50-51; Pl.'s Ex. 9 ("Notice of Illness"). A plaintiff's burden to prove a prima facie case is "de minimis." Stoffan v. Southern New England Telephone Co., 4 F. Supp. 3d 364, 374 (D. Conn. 2014). In the Second Circuit, "a plaintiff can indirectly establish a causal connection to support a discrimination or retaliation claim by 'showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse [employment] action.'" Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 110 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Gorman-Bakos v. Cornell Co-op Extension of Schenectady Cty., 252 F.3d 545, 554 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Reed v. A.W. Lawrence & Co., 95 F.3d 1170, 1178 (2d Cir.1996) (citation and quotation marks omitted))); see also Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 720 (2d Cir. 2002) (citations omitted). Given the temporal proximity here, the court cannot conclude that there is an absence of evidence in the record to support Russell's position, and it must leave the question of causation, a question of fact, for the jury.3
2. Essential Functions
Further, there is a dispute of material fact as to whether Russell was otherwise capable of performing his duties. In order to prevail on a claim of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must demonstrate that [*15]  he was "able to perform the essential functions of that job, either with or without a reasonable accommodation." Borkowski v. Valley Cent. School Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 135 (2d Cir. 1995). "'Essential functions' are duties that are 'fundamental' to the job in question." Vandenbroek v. PSEG Power, CT LLC, 356 Fed. App'x. 457, 459 (2d Cir. 2009) (summary order) (citing Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir.1997)); see also Stevens v. Rite Aid Corp., 851 F.3d 224 (2d Cir. 2017). Although the inquiry into whether a function is "essential" is "fact-specific," "a court will give considerable deference to an employer's determination as to what functions are essential." McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 126 (2d Cir. 2013). Of course, factfinders also consider other factors, such as job descriptions and the amount of time spent performing the function. Id.
Pursuant to section 391.11 of title 49 the Code of Federal Regulations, only a "qualified" individual can drive a commercial motor vehicle, and "a motor carrier shall not . . . permit a person to drive a commercial motor vehicle unless that person is qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle." 49 C.F.R. § 391.11(a). A person is "qualified" to drive a motor vehicle if he "is physically qualified," and a "physically qualified" person is defined as a person who "[h]as no current clinical diagnosis of alcoholism." 49 C.F.R. § 391.11(b)(4); 49 C.F.R. § 391.41(b)(13). Russell does not dispute that, in June 2018, he had a clinical diagnosis of alcoholism. See Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement ¶ 39; Def.'s Ex. 17 (Clinical Discharge Summary [*16]  from Stonington Institute, checking "Alcohol Dependence" under the "SA Diagnosis" category). Thus, under the Regulations, Russell was not "physically qualified" to drive a commercial motor vehicle. See 49 C.F.R. § 391.11(b)(4); 49 C.F.R. § 391.41(b)(13).
Even if compliance with the DOT regulation is an essential function of Russell's job,4 an issue of material fact remains as to whether Russell could have performed that "essential function" "with or without a reasonable accommodation." Borkowski v. Valley Cent. School Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 135 (2d Cir. 1995). The plaintiff bears the burden of production as to the requirement that an accommodation be reasonable. That burden "is not a heavy one." Id. at 138.
It is enough for the plaintiff to suggest the existence of a plausible accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits. Once the plaintiff has done this, [ ]he has made out a prima facie showing that a reasonable accommodation is available, and the risk of non-persuasion falls on the defendant.
Id. (citation omitted). As the Second Circuit has explained, the ADA "envisions an interactive process by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated." McBride v. BIC Consumer Prod. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 99-100 (2d Cir. 2009). However, an employer's "failure to engage in a sufficient interactive [*17]  process does not form the basis of a claim under the ADA," and a plaintiff cannot "avoid summary judgment unless [ ]he also establishes that, at least with the aid of some identified accommodation, [ ]he was qualified for the position at issue." Id. at 101.
There is a question of material fact as to whether a finite medical leave of absence would have allowed Russell to perform the essential function in question, that is, to overcome his diagnosis of alcoholism. 49 C.F.R. § 391.41(b)(13). Russell argues that he "simply needed a reasonable accommodation in the form of a finite medical leave of absence." Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. at 14. The Second Circuit has "never resolved the question of whether paid or unpaid leave can constitute a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." Petrone v. Hampton Bays Union Free School Dist., 568 Fed. App'x. 5, 7 n.2 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order). However, "most other circuits and the EEOC have concluded that, under certain circumstances, a finite term of medical leave may constitute a reasonable accommodation." Taylor v. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41411, 2018 WL 1363063, at *7 (D. Conn. 2018) (citation omitted).5
Further, in his deposition, Russell stated that he would have sought to establish a flexible schedule with Drivers Management to enable him to attend outpatient treatment, but "it never came to that" because he was [*18]  terminated before he could request that accommodation. Russell Dep. at 185, 194. Russell states in his deposition that he was prepared to provide Tomyn with a "slip . . . for Safety" explaining the terms on which he could return to work, but Tomyn "didn't want the return back to work slip." Id. at 194. Pursuant to statute, a "part-time or modified work schedule" can be considered a reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). Here, however, Russell was never given the opportunity to seek such a reasonable accommodation from his employer because, in his view, he was fired before he could raise the issue of a flexible work schedule or time off. The court concludes that Russell has met his minimal burden of suggesting a plausible accommodation, that is, either a finite leave of absence or a flexible work schedule. See also Durrant v. Chemical/Chase Bank/Manhattan, N.A., 81 F. Supp. 2d 518 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (denying summary judgment where the employer "made no serious effort to ascertain [the employee's] condition before firing her, let alone to learn whether some brief or reasonable extension of her leave would enable her to return to work.")
There is a question of fact as to whether Russell could have performed the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation. Because such a [*19]  question of fact exists, the Motion for Summary Judgment, as to Counts One and Two, is denied.6
B. Failure to Accommodate
In addition to discrimination, an employer can violate the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation to a plaintiff with a disability. McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125 (2d Cir. 2013); see also Parker v. Columbia Pictures Industries, 204 F.3d 326, 338 (2d Cir. 2000). In order to state a prima facie failure-to-accommodate claim, a plaintiff must show that "(1) plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability;7 (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations." Rodal v. Anesthesia Grp. of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 2004). Drivers Management does not appear to challenge the first two elements. See Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 28-29.
Drivers Management argues that Russell's failure-to-accommodate claim must fail because Russell never requested an accommodation for his illness or, if he did, that that request—time off, from May 18 to June 8—was "indisputably granted." Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 29. However, for the [*20]  reasons discussed above, there is a question of fact as to whether Russell was terminated when Tomyn told him to "clean out his truck" on June 9, 2017. If the jury were to agree with Russell that he was terminated, then it could agree with Russell that Drivers Management "refused to make such accommodations" as were reasonable, e.g., a finite leave or modified work schedule, by firing Russell before he could request such accommodations.
Drivers Management also argues that, even had Russell requested an accommodation, his failure-to-accommodate claim must fail because he is not otherwise qualified to perform his job. For the same reasons as discussed above, there is a question of material fact as to whether Russell could have performed the essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation, that is, a finite leave of absence to overcome his diagnosis of alcohol dependence, or a modified schedule to accommodate his participation in an outpatient program.
For these reasons, Drivers Management has not shown that it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, and the Motion for Summary Judgment, with respect to Counts Three and Four, is denied.
C. Retaliation
Drivers Management [*21]  argues that Russel cannot prove the ADA retaliation claims (Counts Five and Six) because he did not suffer an adverse employment action and has not presented any evidence that any action was taken because of his disability. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 30-31. In order to establish retaliation under the ADA, an employee must first show a prima facie case that (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) the employer was aware of this activity; (3) the employer took an adverse employment action against the employee; and (4) a causal connection exists between the alleged adverse action and the protected activity. Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. 2002). "Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment decision." Id. at 721. If the defendant can do so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff, who must then "point to evidence that would be sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the employer's explanation is merely a pretext for impermissible retaliation." Id.
Drivers' Management does not contest the first element of the prima facie case of ADA retaliation. See Mem. in Supp. of [*22]  Mot. for Summ. J. at 30 ("Plaintiff arguably engaged in protected conduct when he asked for time off.") It does not address the second. Id. at 30-31. Drivers Management does argue that Russell has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA because he has failed to establish either an adverse action or a causal connection. Id. It further argues that Russell has not introduced evidence to raise a question of fact as to whether its explanation for Russell's termination is pretextual. Id. at 31.
First, there are questions of fact as to whether Russell has established a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA. As discussed above, there is a question of material fact as to whether Russell was terminated or voluntarily resigned from his employment with Drivers Management. See supra at 8-11. Further, in this court's view, Russell has set forth sufficient evidence to raise a material question of fact as to whether there is a causal connection between his request for leave related to his disability on May 18 and the adverse employment action, which, in Russell's view, occurred on June 9. For retaliation claims, "a close temporal relationship between a plaintiff's participation in protected activity [*23]  and an employer's adverse actions can be sufficient to establish causation." Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 720 (2d Cir. 2002) (citations omitted). There is evidence of such a close temporal relationship here, because, drawing all inferences in favor of Russell, Russell was terminated about three weeks after he sought leave to visit a doctor for symptoms related to his hypertension. See Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement, ¶¶ 7-8, 50-51; Pl.'s Ex. 9 ("Notice of Illness").
There are also questions of material fact as to whether Drivers Management's explanation—that it terminated Russell's employment because he voluntarily resigned—is merely a pretext for impermissible retaliation. Drivers Management correctly explains that, even if temporal proximity is sufficient to establish a prima facie case, it is "insufficient to defeat summary judgment at the pretext stage," Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 31 (citing Zann Kwan v. Andalex Grp., LLC, 737 F.3d 834, 843 (2d Cir. 2013)). It argues that there is no evidence that "a retaliatory animus, rather than Plaintiff's silence [in response to Anderson's letters], served as the reason for Anderson's decision to convert Plaintiff's employment status to voluntarily resigned." Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 31. Russell argues that a reasonable juror, considering the [*24]  "facts on the ground," could "determine that [Drivers Management's] claim that [Russell] was voluntarily terminated is false;" in his view, the relevant facts are that Russell thought, with reason, that he had been terminated on June 9, and that he did not respond to Anderson's letters "because they arrived after plaintiff was terminated." See Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. at 17-18.
If the jury agreed with Russell that he was terminated on June 9, 2017, when Tomyn told him to "clean out his truck," Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement ¶ 51-52, then Russell's failure to respond to Anderson's letters—dated June 8, 2017, and June 19, 2017, and requesting a response within 15 days or by June 29, respectively—could not have been the reason for his termination. See Def.'s Ex. 18 (June 8, 2017 letter); Def.'s Ex. 19 (June 19, 2017 letter). In other words, Russell's actions after his termination cannot be a non-retaliatory justification for that termination. Rather, if Russell was terminated on June 9, Drivers Management would need to offer to the jury a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason, as of June 9, for terminating Russell's employment. Drivers Management does not give any reason for terminating Russell's [*25]  employment on June 9. If Drivers Management terminated Russell's employment on June 9, then its current stated reason for his termination—that Russell voluntarily left his employment when he failed to respond to Anderson's letters by June 29—would not be credible. A reasonable juror could conclude that Drivers Management's reason was pretextual. See Graziadio v. Culinary Institute of America, 817 F.3d 415, 430 (2d Cir. 2016) (discussing how an employee may be able to show that an employer's explanation that "it properly fired [the employee] because she abandoned her job" could be "unworthy of credence and hence pretextual" by pointing to "the weakness of the evidence supporting defendants' claim of abandonment.") If Russell was fired on June 9, then the lack of a credible reason for his termination and the temporal proximity between the termination and Russell's leave could support a ruling in Russell's favor. Thus, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the reason for Russell's termination.
Because there remains a question of fact as to when Russell was terminated and as to Drivers Management's motivation for that termination, summary judgment, as to Counts Five and Six, is denied.
D. FMLA claims
Finally, Drivers Management argues that Russell cannot [*26]  prove the FMLA claims (Counts Seven and Eight). The FMLA gives eligible employees twelve workweeks per year of unpaid leave, in order to, inter alia, recover from "a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." See 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). Pursuant to regulation, a "serious health condition" includes a "period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition" that involves treatment by a health care provider which results in a "regimen of continuing treatment." See 29 C.F.R. § 825.115(a), (c).8 At the conclusion of an employee's FMLA leave, an employee "has the right to return to the position she held before taking leave, or to an equivalent position." Woods v. START Treatment & Recovery Centers, Inc., 864 F.3d 158, 166 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(1)(B)) (internal quotation mark omitted); see also Serby v. New York City Dep't of Educ., 526 Fed. App'x 132, 133-34 (2d Cir. 2013).
1. Interference (Count Seven)
There are at least two types of FMLA claims: interference and retaliation. Woods, 864 F.3d at 166. Interference claims arise when "[an] employer has prevented or otherwise impeded the employee's ability to exercise rights under the FMLA." Id. A prima facie interference claim requires a plaintiff to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that:
(1) [*27]  [ ]he is an eligible employee under the FMLA; (2) defendants constitute an employer under the FMLA; (3) [ ]he was entitled to leave under the FMLA; (4) [ ]he gave notice to defendants of [his] intention to take leave; and (5) defendants denied [him] benefits to which [ ]he was entitled by the FMLA.
Di Giovanna v. Beth Israel Medical Center, 651 F. Supp. 2d 193, 199 (2d Cir. 2009). Drivers Management does not contest the first two elements of Russell's FMLA interference claim. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 32. Rather, it argues that Russell is not entitled to relief under the FMLA because: first, Russell failed to complete the FMLA certification forms that Anderson sent him in the mail; second, Russell never gave "notice of any intent to use FMLA leave;" and third, Russell "could not possibly have been unfairly denied benefits as he is unable to show that he was ever entitled to them." Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 32-33.
Russell argues that his employment was terminated on June 9, 2018. Prior to that date, he had taken several weeks of sick leave pursuant to company policy. See Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement ¶ 10-11,19, 23, 49-50. If Russell was terminated on June 9, 2018, then he ceased to be an "employee" as of that date. Therefore, if Russell was terminated on [*28]  June 9, 2018, he cannot establish by a preponderance of the evidence the first element of an interference claim, that he is an "eligible employee under the FMLA." Di Giovanna v. Beth Israel Medical Center, 651 F. Supp. 2d 193, 199 (2d Cir. 2009). Any action Drivers Management took after it fired him could not have "interfered" with his FMLA rights, because Russell was no longer an "eligible employee."
Russell could argue, in the alternative, that if the jury finds that his employment was not terminated on June 9, then Drivers Management interfered with his rights under the FMLA. However, this alternative argument would also fail, because Russell never completed the FMLA certification form Drivers Management sent him and never made a good faith effort to do so or explain why he could not do so. Section 825.305 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides that an employer "may require that an employee's leave . . . due to the employee's own serious health condition . . . be supported by a certification issued by the health care provider." 29 C.F.R. § 825.305(a). The employee must provide the certification "unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts." 29 C.F.R. § 825.305(b). "Good faith requires 'at least that the employee contact his employer by telephone and make it aware that [*29]  he is unable to return his certification before the deadline.'"" Allen v. Verizon Wireless, No. 3:12-CV-482 JCH, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80228, 2013 WL 2467923, at *21 (D. Conn. June 6, 2013) (internal citation omitted). If an employee "fails to provide any certification, the employer may deny the taking of FMLA leave." 29 C.F.R. § 825.305(d). Drivers Management mailed two letters to Russell seeking such certification. Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement ¶¶ 60-61, 64-65; Def.'s Ex. 18 (letter from Patti Anderson, dated June 8, 2017); Def.'s Ex. 19 (letter from Patti Anderson, dated June 19, 2017). Russell never responded to either letter. Id. ¶¶ 63, 70; see also Russell Dep. at 196-97. Because Russell never completed the certification forms nor attempted to contact Drivers Management to explain why he could not return the forms, he was not entitled to FMLA leave after June 9, even if he was still a Drivers Management employee. Thus, he has failed to establish an FMLA interference claim. See Di Giovanna, 651 F. Supp. 2d at 199 (employee must establish that "he was entitled to leave under the FMLA" and that "defendants denied [him] benefits to which [ ]he was entitled by the FMLA.")
In summary, if a jury were to find that Russell's employment was terminated on June 9, it could not conclude [*30]  that he had been denied any FMLA rights, because he ceased to be an "eligible employee" as of that date. In the alternative, if the jury were to find that Russell continued to be an employee after June 9, then it could not conclude that Russell was denied benefits to which he was entitled under the FMLA, because there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding Russell's failure to complete the medical certification forms or make a good-faith effort to do so or explain why he could not. Thus, there are no genuine issues of material fact as to Russell's FMLA interference claim, and Drivers Management is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
2. Retaliation (Count Eight)
The FMLA also prohibits retaliation against an employee for engaging in protected activity. Retaliation claims "involve an employee actually exercising her rights or opposing perceived unlawful conduct under the FMLA and then being subjected to some adverse employment action by the employer." Woods, 864 F.3d at 166. A prima facie retaliation claim requires a plaintiff to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that:
1) he exercised rights protected under the FMLA; 2) he was qualified for his position; 3) he suffered an [*31]  adverse employment action; and 4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of retaliatory intent.
Graziadio v. Culinary Inst. of Am., 817 F.3d 415, 429 (2d Cir. 2016). The burden at the first step is "minimal." Di Giovanna, 651 F. Supp. 2d at 204.
As articulated by the Second Circuit, a prima facie FMLA retaliation claim requires a plaintiff to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that "he was qualified for his position." Graziadio, 817 F.3d at 429. Unlike under the ADA, the Second Circuit's test for retaliation under the FMLA does not provide that an employee can be qualified "with . . . reasonable accommodation." Compare Borkowski, 63 F.3d at 135 (to state a claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he was "able to perform the essential functions of that job, either with or without a reasonable accommodation"), and Graziadio, 817 F.3d 415 (under the FMLA, employee must be "qualified for his position"). The question is, is the employee qualified at the time in question, without any accommodation.
As discussed above, the court cannot conclude that a reasonable juror could find that Russell was "qualified for his position" as of June 9. See supra at 12-14. As of June 9, Russell had a clinical diagnosis of alcoholism, and federal regulations specifically prohibit an individual with a current clinical diagnosis [*32]  of alcoholism from driving a commercial motor vehicle. See 49 C.F.R. § 391.11(a), (b)(4); 49 C.F.R. § 391.41(b)(13); Def.'s L.R. 56(a)(1) Statement ¶ 39; Def.'s Ex. 17 (Clinical Discharge Summary from Stonington Institute, checking "Alcohol Dependence" under the "SA Diagnosis" category). Had Drivers Management permitted Russell to drive a motor vehicle, it would have violated federal regulation. 49 C.F.R. § 391.11(a). Russell's personal view that his alcoholism did not prevent him from driving his truck, see Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)(2) Statement at 5, does not change the fact that compliance with federal regulations was a prerequisite for him to be "qualified for his position" without accommodation, and he did not meet that prerequisite. Graziadio, 817 F.3d at 429.
Russell has not introduced sufficient evidence to raise a question of material fact as to whether, as of June 9, he was "qualified for his position," an element of the prima facie case for FMLA retaliation. Rather, there is no question that Russell was prohibited by federal regulation, as of June 9, from driving a motor vehicle. Therefore, even if Russell's employment was terminated on June 9, because Russell has failed to establish a prima facie case of the second element of an FMLA retaliation claim, Drivers Management is entitled to summary judgment [*33]  as a matter of law as to Count Eight.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, Drivers Management's Motion for Summary Judgement is DENIED in part. It is denied as to all counts, except as to Count Eight, for interference and retaliation under the FMLA. The Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED as to Count Eight. The case will proceed to jury trial on the remaining counts.
SO ORDERED.
Dated this 11th day of February, 2020, at New Haven, Connecticut.
