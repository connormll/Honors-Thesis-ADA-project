CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the motion.
Before the Court is a motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Ross Stores, Inc. ("Defendant" or "Ross"). See Dkt. # 18 ("Mot."). Plaintiffs Terry Marshall ("Marshall"), Cindy Rickel ("Rickel"), and M.M., a minor ("M.M") (collectively, "Plaintiffs"), opposed the motion, see Dkt. # 23 ("Opp."), and Defendant replied, see Dkt. # 24 ("Reply"). The Court finds the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. Having considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the motion.
I. Background
Plaintiffs bring this putative class action to address the alleged pattern of arbitrary discrimination at Defendant's dd's Discount stores in Palmdale and Lancaster, California (the "Stores"). See First Amended Complaint, Dkt # 17 ("FAC"), ¶ 1. Plaintiffs, who are Caucasian, allege that on numerous occasions they have been denied access to the restroom at both Stores based on their race. See id. [*2]  ¶¶ 28 30. According to Plaintiffs, they were denied access to the restroom several times while non-white customers, including Marshall's daughter who is Asian, were permitted to use the restroom so long as they "remain quiet about it." See id. Furthermore, Marshall suffers from diabetes, and on one occasion Defendant's denial of restroom access caused him to soil his pants. See id. ¶ 28
Plaintiffs initiated this action on May 27, 2020. See Complaint, Dkt. # 1. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on July 2, see Dkt. # 15, and Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint ("FAC") on July 22, see FAC. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and three subclasses: (1) the "Caucasian/white Class," defined as "[a]ll whites who have been denied restroom access at the stores because of their race;" (2) the "Disabled Subclass," defined as "[a]ll disabled persons who were denied restroom-access at the stores even after informing the employees of their disability or where the disability was apparent;" and (3) the "Associate Subclass," defined as "[a]ll persons who were with or accompanied Plaintiffs or any other class or subclass member on the day when they were denied restroom access at the stores." See FAC ¶ 10. The FAC asserts six causes of action:
First Cause of Action: violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. FAC ¶¶ 31 44.
Second [*3]  Cause of Action: violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12189 and its enacting regulations. FAC ¶¶ 45 53.
Third Cause of Action: discrimination in violation of California's Unruh Civil Rights Act. FAC ¶¶ 54 67.
Fourth Cause of Action: intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED"). Id. ¶¶ 68 69.
Fifth Cause of Action: negligent hiring, supervision or retention of employee. Id. ¶¶ 70 72.
Sixth Cause of Action: negligent infliction of emotional distress ("NIED"). Id. ¶¶ 73 75.
Defendant now moves to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6), arguing that the FAC lacks sufficient facts to support each of Plaintiffs' claims. See generally Mot.
II. Legal Standard
A. Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)
To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must "contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). In assessing the adequacy of the complaint, the court must accept all pleaded facts as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Turner v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 788 F.3d 1206, 1210 (9th Cir. 2015); Cousins v. Lockyer, 568 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir. 2009). The court then determines whether the complaint "allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. However, [*4]  "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id. Accordingly, "for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, the non-conclusory factual content, and reasonable inferences from that content, must be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief." Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).
B. Leave to Amend
Whether to grant leave to amend rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. See Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir. 1995). Courts consider whether leave to amend would cause undue delay or prejudice to the opposing party, and whether granting leave to amend would be futile. See Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe v. United States, 90 F.3d 351, 355 (9th Cir. 1996). Generally, dismissal without leave to amend is improper "unless it is clear that the complaint could not be saved by any amendment." Jackson v. Carey, 353 F.3d 750, 758 (9th Cir. 2003).
III. Discussion
Defendant argues that each cause of action should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. See Mot. at 5 16. The Court addresses each cause of action in turn.
A. First Cause of Action: Violation of § 1981
Section 1981 prohibits discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts by reason of race, national origin, or ancestry. See 42 U.S.C § 1981. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under Section 1981 outside of the employment context, [*5]  a plaintiff must show: (1) membership in a protected class, (2) an attempt to contract for certain services, and (3) denial of the right to contract for such services. See Lindsey v. SLT Los Angeles, LLC, 447 F.3d 1138, 1145 (9th Cir. 2006).1 "Where a plaintiff is not deprived of the right to make and enforce a contract, there is no violation of 42 U.S.C. section 1981." Johnson v. OfficeMax, Inc., No. CIV 2:11 cv 2578 MCE JFM (PS), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142119, 2011 WL 6141280, at *3 (E.D. Cal. 2011).
Defendant argues Plaintiffs' claim fails under the third element the denial of the right to contract because Plaintiffs completed contracts with Defendant on each of their 22 visits to the stores. See Mot. 5:12 14, 6:3 7; see also FAC ¶¶ 36 ("Plaintiffs did purchase or attempt to purchase items from the stores on each of their visits."). Plaintiffs respond that (1) they have been denied the contractual benefit and privilege of using the store's restroom, and (2) they were denied the right to make a contract when they had to leave the store to find a different restroom. See Opp. at 2 6. The Court agrees with Defendant.
First, Plaintiffs' benefit and privilege argument fails because entering a retail store to purchase an item does not create a contractual right to use the restroom the way that eating in a restaurant might create that right. See Arguello v. Conoco, Inc., 330 F.3d 355, 360 (5th Cir. 2003) (noting cases [*6]  involving discriminatory service in restaurants and nightclubs are different than cases involving discrimination in the retail context "because dining at a restaurant generally involves a contractual relationship that . . . entitles the customer to benefits in addition to the meal purchased" and reasoning that "[r]estaurants are, in that respect, significantly different from retail establishments"); see also Brown v. Mydatt Servs. Inc., No. 07-CV-190-BR, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35642, 2008 WL 1925041, at *5 (D. Or. Apr. 28, 2008) ("[A] contract is not created between a patron and a retail establishment merely by virtue of physically crossing the threshold onto the mall's property . . . § 1981 does not support a claim for the 'possible loss of future contract opportunities,' but 'must involve the actual loss of a contract interest.'").
Nor is the Court persuaded by Plaintiffs' argument that their shopping trip was impacted by their need to use the restroom and Defendant's refusal to let them do so. See Opp. 3:23 4:20. Section 1981 does not guarantee an "enjoyable shopping experience," it guarantees the right to make a contract. See Clark v. Safeway, Inc., No. 3:19-CV-00851-HZ, 478 F. Supp. 3d 1080, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144815, 2020 WL 4677514, at *7 (D. Or. Aug. 12, 2020) ("The fact that the discrimination did not occur while Plaintiff was attempting to consummate the contract is fatal to his section 1981 claim"); see also Johnson, No. 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142119, 2011 WL 6141280, at *3 ("Dampening [*7]  a customer's ardor to effectuate a contract, however, is not an actual loss of a contractual interest upon which relief can be granted."). While Plaintiffs' right to contract may have been interrupted when they left to find a restroom, there is a difference between a customer deciding to leave to find a restroom and a store preventing a customer from making a contract by expulsion from the premises. See Lopez v. Target Corp., 676 F.3d 1230, 1235 (11th Cir. 2012) ("Lopez's claim boils down to the assertion that he was delayed and mistreated [when] making his purchase . . . Because Lopez was able to make his desired purchase . . . Winn's discriminatory conduct did not impair Lopez's right to make contracts under § 1981."); see also Kirt v. Fashion Bug # 3253, Inc., 479 F. Supp. 2d 938, 954, 955 (N.D. Iowa), adhered to on reconsideration sub nom. Kirt v. Fashion Bug # 3253, Inc., 495 F. Supp. 2d 957 (N.D. Iowa 2007) (holding that "hurt feelings and emotional upset resulting from discriminatory conduct, which prompted [plaintiff] to abandon her shopping, do not establish that the discriminatory conduct actually violated her § 1981 right to contract.").
Plaintiffs' second argument, that they were denied a right to contract when they had to leave the store to find a restroom, also fails. Plaintiffs claim, without citing any authority, that "[u]pon [*8]  Plaintiffs existing of the stores, any eventual return starts a new attempt at making and enforcing a new contract." See Opp. 4:15 17. But Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendant took any other action, besides denying them access to the restroom, to prevent them from entering into a contract. At most, Plaintiffs were required to leave the store to relieve themselves, and then return to complete their purchases. This amounts to a delay in entering into a contract rather than a denial. Delay in purchasing is not sufficient for a § 1981 claim. See Lopez, 676 F.3d at 1235; see also Jeffery v. Home Depot U.S.A, Inc., 90 F. Supp. 2d 1066, 1069 (S.D. Cal. 2000) ("Courts have held . . . that claims of delayed service do not rise to the level of interference with a contract sufficient to grant relief under § 1981."). Plaintiffs have not alleged that they were unable to contract.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' first cause of action under § 1981. See Jeffery v. Home Depot U.S.A, Inc., 90 F. Supp. 2d 1066, 1069 (S.D. Cal. 2000) (holding that the plaintiff had not established that he suffered an actual loss of a contract interest where he was able to make a purchase); see also Wolfstein v. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, No. CV 15-7150 PA (AFMx), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143927, 2015 WL 6394472, at *7 (C.D. Cal. 2015) (dismissing a § 1981 claim where it was "undisputed that Plaintiff entered into a contract with Defendants"). Plaintiffs allege [*9]  that they were able to contract when they went to the Stores, and thus they cannot establish the third element of their claim as a matter of law. Thus, amendment would be futile, and the Court DISMISSES the claim with prejudice. See Jackson, 353 F.3d at 758 (dismissal with prejudice is appropriate when amendment could not save the complaint).
B. Second Cause of Action: ADA Violations
Plaintiffs allege two theories of liability under the ADA: (1) failure to provide reasonable accommodation and (2) associational discrimination. See generally Mot. The Court addresses each theory in turn.

i. Failure to provide reasonable accommodation
Marshall alleges Defendant violated Title III of the ADA when Defendant's employees discriminated against him by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability. See FAC ¶¶ 45 53. To establish an ADA claim under Title III, Marshall must prove that: (1) he is disabled; (2) Defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; (3) Defendant employed a discriminatory policy or practice; and (4) Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff based upon Plaintiff's disability by (a) failing to make a requested reasonable modification that [*10]  was (b) necessary to accommodate Plaintiff's disability. See Karczewski v. DCH Mission Valley LLC, 862 F.3d 1006, 1010 (9th Cir. 2017).
Defendant does not contest that Marshall has diabetes and is therefore disabled under the ADA. See Mot. at 7 10. Instead, Defendant argues that (1) an employee-only restroom is not a place of public accommodation covered by Title III of the ADA, see Mot. 7:25 8:19, and (2) Marshall did not request a modification to accommodate his disability, see Mot. 8:20 10:4.2
Defendant is correct that if a facility is not public, employees can refuse to let customers with disabilities use the facility without violating the ADA. See Doran v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 524 F.3d 1034, 1048 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding that "the exclusion of a disabled plaintiff from an employees-only restroom does not violate the ADA" because, when only part of the facility is open to the public, "the portion that is closed to the public is not a place of public accommodation and thus is not subject to Title III of the ADA"). However, the FAC asserts that Defendant's employees permitted some people to use the restroom and not others, see FAC ¶¶ 28 30, indicating that the restroom may not truly be for employees only. Because the Court is to accept all factual allegations as true on a motion to dismiss, see Skilstaf, Inc. v. CVS Caremark Corp., 669 F.3d 1005, 1024 (9th Cir. 2012), at this stage [*11]  the Court assumes the restroom was at least partially open to the public. See Johnson v. Sweet Spark, Inc., No. 2:17-CV-02474 WBS DB, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184485, 2019 WL 5422949, at *2 *3 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 23, 2019) (holding that whether the restroom was public was a disputed fact when "plaintiff's investigator was able to evaluate the bathroom and take pictures and measurements"); see also Petinsky v. 1800 Palm, LLC, No. 13-23516-CIV, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174686, 2013 WL 6576863, at *4 *5 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 13, 2013) (denying a motion to dismiss because of the dispute over whether the restrooms were private or public).
However, Plaintiffs fail to adequately allege that Marshall requested reasonable accommodation. The FAC states that "Marshall soiled his pants on one occasion . . . when he was denied restroom access while shopping at the store even when he informed the store of his disability." See FAC ¶ 53. While this is sufficient to allege that Defendant's employees were on notice of Marshall's disability, it is not sufficient for the Court to infer that Marshall informed the employees for the purpose of requesting a reasonable accommodation. See Castillo v. Hudson Theatre, LLC, 412 F. Supp. 3d 447, 451 452 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (granting a motion to dismiss because "[w]ithout [plaintiff] requesting an actual modification, though, it is impossible to determine whether the Theaters were actually unwilling to accommodate Castillo, rendering her [*12]  allegations merely conclusory."). Thus, Plaintiffs have not successfully alleged a disability discrimination claim based on failure to provide reasonable accommodation.
Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES this portion of the claim and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations that Marshall requested reasonable accommodations.

ii. Associational discrimination
Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants discriminated against M.M. and Rickel based on their "association" with Marshall. FAC ¶¶ 52 53. Under 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(I)(E):
It shall be discriminatory to exclude or otherwise deny equal goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, accommodations, or other opportunities to an individual or entity because of the known disability of an individual with whom the individual or entity is known to have a relationship or association.
M.M. and Rickel do not allege they were discriminated against based on Marshall's disability, but on the basis of race. See FAC ¶¶ 3, 14, 27 29, 51, 53, 58, 62 64, 69. See generally McCullum v. Orlando Reg'l Healthcare Sys., Inc., 768 F.3d 1135, 1142 (11th Cir. 2014) ("[t]he [ADA] text makes clear that a non-disabled individual has standing to bring suit under the ADA only if she was personally discriminated against or denied some benefit because of her association with [*13]  a disabled person").
Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES this portion of the claim and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations that Marshall's disability was the basis for Defendant's employee's discrimination.
C. Third Cause of Action: Unruh Act Violations
Plaintiffs allege Defendant violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act by discriminating on the basis of (1) race and (2) disability. See FAC ¶¶ 58, 65. The Unruh Act provides that "[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of [California] are free and equal, and no matter what their . . . disability [or] medical condition . . . are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever." Cal. Civ. Code § 51(b). By its terms, the Unruh Act "does not extend to practices and policies that apply equally to all persons." Turner v. Ass'n of Am. Med. Colls., 167 Cal. App. 4th 1401, 1408, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d 94 (2008) (citing Cal. Civ.Code § 51(c)). Thus, to establish a violation of the Unruh Act, Plaintiffs must "plead and prove intentional discrimination in public accommodations in violation of the terms of the Act." Munson v. Del Taco, Inc., 46 Cal.4th 661, 668, 94 Cal. Rptr. 3d 685, 208 P.3d 623 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).
As a preliminary matter, the Court dismisses the disability discrimination claim because Plaintiffs do not allege any facts from which to [*14]  infer discriminatory intent. See Duronslet v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 266 F. Supp. 3d 1213, 1217 (C.D. Cal. 2017) (granting a motion to dismiss when the complaint did not "include [any] factual context that gives rise to a plausible inference of discriminatory intent"). Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss the Unruh Act claim based on disability discrimination and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations supporting this portion of the claim.
Whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged intentional racial discrimination is a closer call. Plaintiffs do not contest that Defendant has a facially neutral policy, but instead argue that the FAC sufficiently pleads intentional discrimination. See Opp. at 8 9. Defendant is correct that the Unruh Act contemplates "willful, affirmative misconduct on the part of those who violate the Act" and that a plaintiff must therefore allege, and show, more than the disparate impact of a facially neutral policy. Koebke v. Bernardo Heights Country Club, 36 Cal. 4th 824, 853, 854, 31 Cal. Rptr. 3d 565, 115 P.3d 1212(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, in Koebke, the California Supreme Court went on to consider evidence of disparate impact and concluded that the defendant "did not apply its facially neutral policy in an impartial manner." Id.
Accepting Plaintiffs' FAC allegations as true, they have sufficiently alleged [*15]  an Unruh Act violation. While an employee-only restroom policy is facially neutral, Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendant enforced the employee-only rule discriminatorily. Hankins v. El Torito Restaurants, Inc. is illustrative, 63 Cal. App. 4th 510, 74 Cal. Rptr. 2d 684, (1998). In Hankins, a plaintiff on crutches could not climb the stairs to access the customer restroom on the second floor and requested to use to the employee restroom on the first floor. See id. at 515. The appeals court upheld the Unruh Act verdict for the plaintiff, explaining:
El Torito admits that Hankins was denied access to a restroom pursuant to company policy, but contends the policy was not discriminatory because it applied to all restaurant patrons. In other words, El Torito contends, all customers were denied access to the employee restroom. However, El Torito's policy was not, as it contends, to deny all patrons access to a restroom. Rather, a combination of its policy and the physical layout of its premises allowed patrons who were not physically handicapped to use a restroom while dining at the restaurant (the one on the second floor), but denied that same service to physically handicapped patrons even though there was a restroom on the premises (the one behind [*16]  the kitchen) that a physically disabled person could otherwise use. El Torito's policy thus discriminated against disabled patrons.
Id. at 518. Similarly, here, Defendant argues that its policy does not discriminate because it applies to all customers. However, accepting the allegations in the FAC as true, the policy is not applied neutrally to all customers because a select group of customers are allowed to use the restroom.
The cases Defendant cites are distinguishable. For example, in Duronslet v. County of Los Angeles, the defendant was not on notice that the plaintiff was transgender and thus could not have discriminated on that basis, 266 F.Supp.3d 1213, 1217 (C.D. Cal. 2017). Here, Defendant does not argue that its employees were unaware of Plaintiffs' race.
Moreover, Plaintiffs allege facts specific to themselves to infer there was racial bias, which distinguishes two other cases upon which Defendant relies. In Dallas and Lashmi, Inc. v. 7-Eleven, Inc., the plaintiffs' complaint lacked any plaintiff-specific facts or allegations of racial bias, 112 F. Supp. 3d 1048, 1062, 1063 (C.D. Cal. 2015). Similarly, in C.B. v. Sonora School Dist., the plaintiff alleged "no facts from which it may be inferred that this decision [to call the police when the plaintiff was nonresponsive at [*17]  school] was based on Plaintiff's disability," 691 F. Supp.2d 1123, 1155 (E.D. Cal. 2009). Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs allege that they were denied access to the restroom while "[Marshall's] Asian daughter has been allowed free and permanent access to the stores' restrooms" and "a store employee allow[ed] a black female customer access to the restroom when [Rickel and M.M.] had been refused access a few minutes earlier." See FAC ¶ 58.3
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss the Unruh Civil Rights Act claim for racial discrimination.
D. Fourth Cause of Action: IIED
Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient facts to support an IIED claim. To plead a claim for IIED under California law, a claimant must allege that the accused "(1) engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, severe emotional distress . . .; (2) the [claimant] actually suffered severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) the outrageous conduct was the actual and proximate cause of the emotional distress." Ross v. Creel Printing & Publ'g Co., 100 Cal. App. 4th 736, 744, 745, 122 Cal. Rptr. 2d 787 (2002). "To be outrageous, conduct must be 'so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.'" Id. at 745 (quoting Cervantez v. J.C. Penney Co., 24 Cal. 3d 579, 593, 156 Cal. Rptr. 198, 595 P.2d 975 (1979)).
The allegations [*18]  in the FAC are conclusory and do not support an IIED claim. The FAC concludes that "Defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct" without specifying any facts to support this conclusion. See FAC ¶ 69. Plaintiffs argue in their opposition that "racial discrimination" is "extreme and outrageous" and "[t]he fact that Plaintiffs are Caucasian does not make racism less outrageous than it would have been had it happened to Blacks or other racial minorities." See Opp. 9:13 16. However, "[a]n allegation of discrimination based on one's characteristics as a member of a protected class alone does not suffice to allege extreme or outrageous conduct for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress." King v. Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America, No. CIV S-08-2612 LKK/EFB, 2009 WL 10690949, at *6 (E.D. Cal. 2009).
Furthermore, Plaintiffs' allegations of "severe emotional distress" are conclusory. For example, Plaintiffs assert that they suffered "severe emotional and physical harm," see FAC ¶ 66, and have "been emotionally traumatized," see id. ¶ 67. Conclusory allegations like these are not enough to state an IIED claim. See Grundy v. Walmart, Inc., No. 18-1720-PSG (SKx), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 227111, 2018 WL 5880914, at *6 (C.D. Cal. 2018) (dismissing plaintiffs' IIED claim where plaintiffs provided only [*19]  threadbare allegations that they "suffered 'anguish, horror, nervousness, grief, anxiety, worry, shock, humiliation and/or shame'").
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' fourth cause of action and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations supporting the claim.
E. Fifth Cause of Action: Negligent Hiring, Supervision, or Retention
Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient facts to support a claim for negligent hiring, supervision or retention. Under California law, an employer may be held directly liable for the behavior of an unfit employee where the employer was negligent in the hiring, training, supervising, or retaining of that employee. See Keum v. Virgin America Inc., 781 F.Supp.2d 944, 951 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (citation omitted). Negligence is a core element of this claim the plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer "knew or should have known that hiring the employee created a particular risk or hazard and that particular harm materializes." Id. The rule "requires some nexus or causal connection between the [employer]'s negligence in selecting or controlling an [employee], the [employee]'s employment or work, and the harm suffered by the third party." Phillips v. TLC Plumbing, Inc., 172 Cal. App. 4th 1133, 1139, 1140, 91 Cal. Rptr. 3d 864 (2009).
The FAC does not state that Defendant knew or should have known [*20]  that any particular employee presents an undue risk of harm, because Plaintiffs do not identify any particular employee in the FAC. See FAC ¶ 71. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argument that "even after their Attorney put ROSS on notice about the discriminatory policies, Plaintiffs were still denied restroom access at the Lancaster store on the same day that [Marshall's] daughter was granted access to the same restroom," see Opp. 11:3 6; FAC ¶ 30, is insufficient to support their claim. Plaintiffs do not allege that there was a connection between Defendant's hiring or supervisory practices and a risk of undue harm to Plaintiffs. See Molina v. City of Visalia, No. 13-01991-LJO-SAB, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46448, 2014 WL 1329711, at *1 (E.D. Cal. 2014) ("[N]egligence liability will only be imposed upon a supervisor or employer that knew or should have known that the particular hiring/supervision decision or training practice created a particular risk or hazard.") (internal quotation marks omitted).
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss as to Plaintiff's fifth cause of action and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations supporting the claim.
F. Sixth Cause of Action: NIED
Plaintiffs' NIED claim also fails. In California, NIED claims are analyzed [*21]  as general negligence claims in which the traditional elements of duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages apply. See Marlene F. v. Affiliated Psychiatric Med. Clinic, Inc., 48 Cal. 3d 583, 588, 257 Cal. Rptr. 98, 770 P.2d 278 (1989). A claim for NIED requires that Plaintiffs allege the following: (1) Defendant has a duty of care to Plaintiffs; (2) Defendant breached that duty; (3) Defendant's breach of the duty of care threatened physical injury to the Plaintiffs, unless Defendant's negligence was of a highly unusual type or Plaintiffs' serious emotional distress was a predictable result of the breach; (4) Plaintiffs suffered serious emotional distress; (5) Defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs' serious emotional distress; and (6) Plaintiffs suffered damages. See Galvan v. Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, U.S., Inc., 425 F.Supp.3d 1234, 1245 (C.D. Cal. 2019) (citing Wong v. Tai Jing, 189 Cal. App. 4th 1354, 1377, 1378, 117 Cal. Rptr. 3d 747 (2010)). As with Plaintiffs' IIED and negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claims, the allegations in the FAC are entirely conclusory and do not include factual allegations to support any of the elements of a cause of action for negligence. See Goulatte v. CitiMortgage, Inc., No. 12-391-PSG (SPx), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190366, 2013 WL 12132060, at *7 (C.D. Cal. 2013).
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' sixth cause of action and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations supporting the claim.
G. Summary
The Court concludes as follows:
• As [*22]  to the first cause of action under § 1981, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss and DISMISSES the claim with prejudice.
• As to the second cause of action under the ADA, the Court DISMISSES the claim based on disability discrimination and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations that Marshall requested reasonable accommodations. The Court also DISMISSES the claim based on associational discrimination and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations that Marshall's disability was the basis for Defendant's employee's discrimination.
• As to the third cause of action under the Unruh Act, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss the claim based on disability discrimination and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations supporting the claim. The Court DENIES the motion to dismiss the claim based on racial discrimination.
• As to the fourth cause of action for IIED, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations supporting the claim.
• As to the fifth cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations supporting the claim. [*23] 
• As to the sixth cause of action for NIED, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss and GRANTS leave to amend to include allegations supporting the claim.
IV. Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' first, second, fourth, fifth and sixth causes of action, as well as Plaintiffs' third cause of action for disability discrimination. The Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' third cause of action for racial discrimination.
Any amended complaint must be filed no later than November 15, 2020. Failure to file an amended complaint by that date will result in the dismissed claims being dismissed with prejudice.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
