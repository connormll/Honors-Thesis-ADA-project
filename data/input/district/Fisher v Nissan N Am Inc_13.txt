Opinion



MEMORANDUM
Pending before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. Nos. 24, 26). Plaintiff filed a response in opposition (Doc. No. 33), and Defendant has replied. (Doc. No. 40). Plaintiff also filed a sur-reply in opposition to Defendant's motion. (Doc. No. 45). For the reasons discussed below, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Nissan employed Michael Fisher ("Plaintiff") as a full-time Production Technician from January of 2003 until February 10, 2017. (Doc. No. 34 ¶ 1). Plaintiff worked the production line; if he stepped off the production line for any reason, someone else would have to perform his job functions. (Id. ¶ 3). Plaintiff worked on the day shift Monday through Friday, and had three regularly scheduled breaks throughout the day, lasting from ten to thirty minutes. ( [*2] Id. ¶ 2). In 2015, Plaintiff began an extended leave of absence and underwent kidney surgery on August 4, 2016. (Id. ¶ ¶ 5-6). Plaintiff returned from leave in October of 2016, after Plaintiff's physician provided a letter to Nissan stating Plaintiff was cleared to return to work at full duty as of October 17, 2016. (Id. ¶ 7).
After returning to work from his extended leave, Nissan placed Plaintiff in an open job rotation in Closures to ease his transition. (Id. ¶ 8). Plaintiff was initially satisfied with his placement, but once he began performing the job he felt the job was more difficult than his prior rotation, so he spoke to his manager and asked if he could return to his original job. (Id. ¶ 9). Plaintiff's request was approved. (Id.). On October 20, 2016, Plaintiff's doctor drafted a letter stating Plaintiff needed "at least another month" off of work. (Id. ¶ 10). Nissan approved the request and additional leave until December 29, 2016. (Id.). Though approved for additional leave until late December, Plaintiff voluntarily returned to work on November 21, 2016. (Id. ¶ 11). After returning to work for the second time, Plaintiff's only suggested restriction was that he be permitted [*3]  additional restroom breaks as needed; Nissan honored the request. (Id. ¶ 12).1 To Plaintiff, his request for extra breaks meant being relieved of his job duties for an additional twenty-five to thirty minutes a day, half-day shifts, and the ability to walk off the line and go outside when he wanted. (Id.). On January 5, 2017, Plaintiff requested he be allowed to wear a leather boot to assist with gout, and the request was honored. (Id. ¶ 14).
On January 18, 2017, Chris Hargrove ("Hargrove"), Plaintiff's Supervisor, and Gavin Higgins ("Higgins") from Human Resources, met with Plaintiff to issue him a verbal reminder of Nissan's attendance policy. (Id. ¶ 16). Plaintiff had left work early on December 21, 2016, January 4, 2017, and January 11, 2017, without accrued paid time leave ("PTO") to cover his absences and missed work on January 12, 2017. (Id. ¶ 15). On January 27, 2017, Hargrove and Higgins issued Plaintiff a written reminder of the company's attendance policy due to Plaintiff leaving work early on January 19, 2017, and being absent from work on January 25, 2017. (Id. ¶ 18).
After receiving the written reminder, Plaintiff left work early without notice or PTO to cover the time. [*4]  (Id. ¶ 19). Hargrove and Human Resources representative Jeff Owens ("Owens") met with Plaintiff on February 3, 2017, to issue Plaintiff a final written reminder of the company's attendance policy. (Id.). After the meeting ended, Plaintiff initially returned to work but then left in the middle of his shift without notice. (Id. ¶ 20). On February 10, 2017, Plaintiff's employment was terminated for absenteeism. (Id. ¶ 21). After his termination Plaintiff did not seek any mental health treatment since returning from leave in October 2016. (Id. ¶ 28).
Plaintiff filed his Complaint on May 8, 2017, alleging Nissan violated the American with Disabilities Act ("ADA") for discrimination, failure to accommodate, failure to engage in the interactive process, discrimination under the Tennessee Disability Act ("TDA"), and intentional inflection of emotional distress. (Doc. No. 1). In response, Nissan argues Plaintiff is not a qualified individual under the ADA or TDA, Plaintiff's accommodations were not reasonable, and Nissan has not engaged in any outrageous conduct to base a claim for intentional inflection of emotional distress ("IIED"). (Doc. No. 24).

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is [*5]  appropriate "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party bringing the summary judgment motion has the initial burden of informing the Court of the basis for its motion and identifying portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute over material facts. Rodgers v. Banks, 344 F.3d 587, 595 (6th Cir. 2003). The moving party may satisfy this burden by presenting affirmative evidence that negates an element of the non-moving party's claim or by demonstrating an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Id.
In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court views the facts in the light most favorable for the nonmoving party, and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Bible Believers v. Wayne Cty., Mich., 805 F.3d 228, 242 (6th Cir. 2015); Wexler v. White's Fine Furniture, Inc., 317 F.3d 564, 570 (6th Cir. 2003). The Court does not weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, or determine the truth of the matter. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Rather, the Court determines whether sufficient evidence has been presented to make the issue of material fact a proper jury question. Id. The mere scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving party's position is insufficient to survive summary judgment; instead, there must be evidence [*6]  of which the jury could reasonably find for the nonmoving party. Rodgers v. Banks, 344 F.3d 587, 595 (6th Cir. 2003).

III. ANALYSIS

A. PLAINTIFF'S ADA AND TDA CLAIMS
Title I of the ADA and the TDA prohibit covered employers from discriminating against a "qualified individual on the basis of disability with regard to hiring, advancement, training, termination, and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment."2 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a), Tenn. Code Ann. § 8-50-103(b).

1. Discrimination Under The ADA and TDA
To prevail on a claim of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show "(1) he or she is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA, (2) he or she is a qualified individual who can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) the employer terminated the plaintiff because of the disability." Bailey v. Real Time Staffing Servs., Inc., 927 F. Supp. 2d 490, 495 (W.D. Tenn. Aug. 7, 2012) (citing Gantt v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., 143 F.3d 1042, 1047 (6th Cir.1998)). Employment discrimination can be proven with direct evidence of discriminatory intent. Id. A plaintiff may also prove discrimination with circumstantial evidence, using the prima facie case and the familiar burden-shifting method articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Gantt, 143 F.3d at 1047. Plaintiff asserts that he has direct evidence of discrimination because his attendance issues were directly related to and caused by overworking his kidney after his transplant. [*7]  (Doc. No. 33 at 4). Defendant responds that Plaintiff cannot point to any direct evidence that Defendant terminated him due to his disability, because his termination was caused by his frequent absenteeism. (Doc. No. 40 at 3).
"Direct evidence is evidence that 'if believed, requires the conclusion that unlawful discrimination was at least a motivating factor' in the adverse employment action." Erwin v. Potter, 79 Fed. Appx. 893, 896 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting Bartlik v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 73 F.3d 100, 103 n. 5 (6th Cir. 1996)). When direct evidence is presented, "no inference is necessary to conclude that the employee has proven this form of discrimination." Coffman v. Robert J. Young Co., 871 F. Supp. 2d 703, 714 (M.D. Tenn. 2012) (citing Kleiber v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., 485 F.3d 862, 868 (6th Cir. 2007)). "[D]irect evidence might 'take the form, for example, of an employer telling an employee, I fired you because you are disabled.'" Burress v. City of Franklin, Tenn.,809 F.Supp.2d 795, 810 (M.D. Tenn. 2011) (quoting Smith v. Chrysler Corp., 155 F.3d 799, 805 (6th Cir. 1998)). "If the plaintiff presents credible direct evidence of discrimination, then the defendant's burden is a burden of persuasion—not merely production—to show that the defendant would have made the same decision even if not motivated by discrimination." Johnson v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 215 F.3d 561, 572-73 (6th Cir. 2000); Jacklyn v. Schering-Plough Healthcare Prods. Sales Corp., 176 F.3d 921, 926 (6th Cir. 1999).
The Sixth Circuit has stated that where a plaintiff presents direct evidence of disability discrimination, the initial burden is then on the plaintiff to show that "[]he (1) has a disability, and (2) is 'otherwise qualified' for the position, either '(a) [*8]  without accommodation from the employer; (b) with an alleged essential job requirement eliminated; or (c) with a proposed reasonable accommodation." Kempter v. Michigan Bell Tel. Co., 534 Fed. Appx. 487, 490, 2013 WL 4504760 at *3 (6th Cir. 2013) (quoting, Kleiber v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., 485 F.3d 862, 869 (6th Cir. 2007)). "After the prima facie case is made, the burden shifts to the employer to prove that the 'challenged job criterion is essential' (defeating the employee's showing in (b)) or that the proposed accommodation will impose an undue hardship upon the employer." Id.
Here, Plaintiff cites as direct evidence of disability discrimination that he was terminated for leaving work early because of kidney disease. (Doc. No. 33 at 4). Plaintiff argues his kidney disease was the cause of his absenteeism, which caused his termination, therefore he presents direct evidence of disability discrimination. (Id.). Plaintiff cites to Monette v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 90 F.3d 1173 (6th Cir. 1996), in which the Sixth Circuit found the defendant's own explanations for terminating plaintiff all relied on plaintiff's disability. Monette, 90 F.3d at 1187. Plaintiff argues that like Monette, he was unable to work a full shift due to his kidney function. (Doc. No. 33 at 4).
Plaintiff's direct evidence of disability discrimination is insufficient to withstand Defendant's summary judgment motion. Plaintiff admits that Defendant advised him that [*9]  the termination resulted from absenteeism. (Doc. No. 34, ¶ 21). The Court does not agree that Defendant's decision to terminate Plaintiff constitutes direct evidence of discrimination. See Hedrick v. W. Reserve Care Sys., 355 F.3d 444, 453 (6th Cir. 2004) (rejecting direct evidence of disability discrimination after testimony expressed plaintiff's medical condition would prohibit her from being able to perform job as case manager); Burress v. City of Franklin, Tenn., 809 F. Supp. 2d 795, 811 (M.D. Tenn. 2011) (reasoning that supervisor's letter noting that Plaintiff was receiving long-term disability benefits and terminating plaintiff for inability to perform essential functions of job was direct evidence of discrimination); Coffman v. Robert J. Young Co., Inc., 871 F. Supp. 2d 703, 714-15 (M.D. Tenn. 2012) (finding a jury could find that defendant's decision to terminate plaintiff was motivated by plaintiff's disability after termination letter stated the plaintiff was terminated due to her long term disability). That Plaintiff took extended leave for his kidney transplant and was thereafter terminated for multiple absences, does not directly establish that the termination was because of Plaintiffs disability.3
Because Plaintiff's brief does not address indirect evidence of disability discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework,4 the Court will not conduct that analysis. Therefore, Defendant's motion [*10]  for summary judgment for ADA discrimination is GRANTED.

2. Harassment5 Under the ADA
Plaintiff alleges Defendant harassed him due to his disability after returning from his extended leave. (Doc. No. 33 at 14).
To establish a hostile work environment, plaintiff must demonstrate that: "(1) []he was disabled; (2) []he was subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on [his] disability; (4) the harassment unreasonably interfered with [his] work performance; and (5) the defendant either knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take corrective measures." Trepka v. Bd. of Educ., 28 Fed. Appx. 455, 461 (6th Cir. 2002). The Supreme Court has stated that the conduct must be "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment," and that conduct that is "merely offensive" does not satisfy these requirements. Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993); see also Sasser v. Quebecor Printing (USA) Corp., 159 S.W.3d 579, 584 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004).
To prove a hostile work environment, the employee must show conduct that is "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Bowman v. Shawnee State Univ., 220 F.3d 456, 463 (6th Cir. 2000). Conduct that is "merely offensive" does not rise to the level of that which will support a claim of hostile work environment. Harris, 510 U.S. at 21. "The court must [*11]  look at the totality of the circumstances, considering the following factors: the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." Handshoe v. Mercy Med. Ctr., 34 Fed. Appx. 441, 448 (6th Cir. 2002).
Plaintiff argues he flicked a cigarette butt and his supervisor embarrassed him by trying to get him fired. (Doc. No. 33 at 14). Plaintiff also argues that before his kidney transplant and extended leave he never had any write ups or discipline issues, but after his return Plaintiff was immediately disciplined in the first week of January for attendance. (Id.). A month later, Plaintiff received a second tardy that would lead to his termination. (Id.).6 Plaintiff asserts this type of treatment constitutes harassment under the ADA. Defendant responds that this conduct does not rise to the level of severe or pervasive harassment. (Doc. No. 26 at 19-20).
Plaintiff's harassment claim fails for two reasons. First, the claimed harassment is not sufficiently severe or pervasive to be actionable. To be actionable, both an objective and a subjective test must be met. "[T]he conduct must be severe or [*12]  pervasive enough to create an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive and the victim must subjectively regard that environment as abusive." Handshoe v. Mercy Med. Ctr., 34 Fed. Appx. 441, 2002 WL 649070, at *7 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Bowman v. Shawnee State Univ., 220 F.3d 456, 463 (6th Cir. 2000)). The Court looks to the totality of the circumstances and finds Plaintiff only offers his own conclusory statements with respect to his complaints of his supervisors conduct.7 Even assuming the testimony to be true, the effect of the conduct he complains of does not rise to the level of harassment. Handshoe, 34 Fed. Appx. 441, 202 WL 649070, at 7. The actions by Defendant do not rise to the level of sufficient severity to harass Defendant and Plaintiff provides no evidence that Defendant's conduct was based on his disability. See, e.g., Batuyong v. Gates, 337 Fed. Appx. 451, 457 (6th Cir. 2009) (holding that supervisor who "raised his voice, inappropriately, became verbally abusive, and chastised [plaintiff] in front of others" did not create hostile work environment); Goller v. Ohio Dep't of Rehab. & Corr., 285 Fed. Appx. 250 (6th Cir. 2008) (finding that supervisor's derogatory name calling was insufficient to establish hostile work environment, especially where the plaintiff did not produce any evidence that it was sufficiently severe or threatening to interfere with the plaintiff's work performance); Trepka v. Bd. of Educ., 28 Fed. Appx. 455, 461 (6th Cir. 2002) (concluding that supervisor's "contentious oral confrontation" with yelling, "stern [*13]  words about [plaintiff's] ability to walk" and "words express skepticism regarding [plaintiff's] condition" did not create hostile work environment); Coulson v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 31 Fed. Appx. 851, 858 (6th Cir. 2002) (holding that being called "looney toon," "wacko," "crazy," and "Rambo" was insufficient to create hostile work environment).
Accordingly, Plaintiff does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to his harassment claim, and Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the ADA harassment claim is GRANTED.

3. Failure to Accommodate Under the ADA
Defendant argues it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA failure-toaccommodate claim. To establish a prima facie failure-to-accommodate claim, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he is disabled under the ADA; (2) he is otherwise qualified for the position, with or without a reasonable accommodation; (3) his employer knew or had reason to know of his disability; (4) he requested a reasonable accommodation; and (5) the employer failed to provide the reasonable accommodation. Cotuna v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 22749, 2017 WL 5171247, at *2 (6th Cir. 2017). The employee bears the burden of requesting a reasonable accommodation and showing that the accommodation is objectively reasonable. Aldini v. Kroger Co. of Michigan, 628 Fed. Appx. 347, 350 (6th Cir. 2015); Kleiber v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., 485 F.3d 862, 870 (6th Cir. 2007). "Importantly, an employee cannot force h[is] employer to provide a specific [*14]  accommodation if the employer offers another reasonable accommodation. Hedrick v. W. Reserve Care Sys. & Forum Health, 355 F.3d 444, 457 (6th Cir. 2004). "If an employee rejects a reasonable accommodation, the individual is no longer considered a 'qualified individual with a disability.'" Id. A plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation triggers "an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). This interactive process is mandatory. Nance v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 527 F.3d 539, 556 (6th Cir. 2008). Parties are therefore directed to participate directly with each other, Kleiber, 485 F.3d at 871, and not "obstruct the process or refuse to participate" in good faith. Jakubowski v. Christ Hosp., Inc., 627 F.3d 195, 202 (6th Cir. 2010). An employer failing to participate in good faith faces liability under the ADA if a reasonable accommodation would have been possible. Lafata v. Church of Christ Home for Aged, 325 F. App'x 416, 422 (6th Cir. 2009).
First, Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot satisfy the prima facie elements for failure to accommodate because Plaintiff was not "otherwise qualified" because he could not perform the essential functions of his job. (Doc. No. 26 at 10). In order for Plaintiff to perform his job he had to be physically present at work, and Plaintiff contends that he could not work a full shift or complete a forty-hour week. (Id.). Defendant also argues Plaintiff was not "otherwise qualified" because he could not [*15]  satisfy basic attendance and schedule requirements, which are grounds for finding that a disabled individual is not a qualified individual under the ADA. (Id. at 11). Second, Defendant argues Plaintiff's accommodation request was unreasonable. (Id.). Defendant asserts that allowing Plaintiff to work half a shift or walk off the production line whenever he wanted was not a reasonable accommodation because it removed an essential job function required of all Production Technicians—the ability to work a complete shift. (Id. at 12). Furthermore, Defendant argues they attempted to move Plaintiff to an "easier" position in October 2016, but Plaintiff soon asked for more leave and to be moved back to his original position. (Id. at 13). Defendant approved Plaintiff's additional time off from work, and also honored the temporary restrictions that were provided by Plaintiff's doctor concerning extra bathroom breaks and a leather boot for Plaintiff's gout. (Id.). Therefore, Defendant argues Plaintiff's claim should fail.
Plaintiff responds that Defendant failed to initiate the interactive process when he requested an easier job in 2015, before his transplant surgery. (Doc. No. 33 at 6). Plaintiff argues after he was sent [*16]  on leave he never received an accommodation. (Id. at 7). After his return from medical leave, in January 2017, Plaintiff argues he could have completed his shifts with modification, but instead was sent home multiple times due to his kidney issues. (Id. at 8). Plaintiff also asserts he specifically identified jobs to Hargrove that would accommodate his disability, but Hargrove stated that his hands were tied. (Id.).
The undisputed facts show Plaintiff requested an accommodation in October 2016, and Defendant placed Plaintiff in an open job rotation in Closures to ease his transition back into work. (Doc. No. 34 at 3). However, when Plaintiff realized the job was more difficult than his prior job he requested he be returned to his original job, and the request was approved. (Id.); see also Kleiber v. Honda of America Mfg., Inc., 485 F.3d 862, 869 (6th Cir. 2007) (finding "an employer has a duty under the ADA to consider transferring a disabled employee who can no longer perform his old job even with accommodation to a new position within the [c]ompany for which that employee is otherwise qualified. However, this duty does not require employers to create new jobs [or] displace existing employees from their positions ... in order to accommodate a disabled individual."). Defendant [*17]  also approved Plaintiff's request to take additional leave from October to December 2016, to allow him more time to recover. (Doc. No. 34, ¶ 10). Plaintiff voluntarily returned to work in November with his only suggested restriction was that he be permitted additional restroom breaks and wear a leather boot. (Id. ¶ 11).8 Both accommodations were approved. Plaintiff admitted he could not work a forty-hour week or perform the functions of his job, and continually left work early or did not attend work in violation of the company's attendance policy. (Id. ¶ 22). Plaintiff's job required him to be physically present at work, and if Plaintiff was not present on the production line someone else would have to step in to perform his job functions. (Id. ¶ 3). Because Plaintiff could not meet the attendance requirements of the company, Plaintiff cannot be considered a qualified individual protected by the ADA. See Banks v. Bosch Rexroth Corp., 610 Fed. Appx. 519, 528 (6th Cir. 2015) (citing Gantt v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., 143 F.3d 1042, 1047 (6th Cir. 1998)). Finally, the undisputed facts shows Defendant engaged in the interactive process by allowing Plaintiff to take additional leave (Doc. No. 34 ¶ 10), transferring him to another position (Id. ¶ 8) after his kidney transplant, and allowing him to wear a boot and take frequent [*18]  restroom breaks. (Id. ¶ ¶ 12, 14). The record suggests that Defendant sought, in good faith, to accommodate Plaintiff's requests. (Id. ¶ ¶ 5, 8-10, 12, 14).
For the following reasons, Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate claim is GRANTED.

B. INTENTIONAL INFLECTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
Finally, Plaintiff asserts a claim for Intentional Inflection of Emotional Distress ("IIED") based on Defendant alleged harassing Plaintiff on "a daily basis to include multiple write-ups, yelling at him, and threatening him that if he was one second late he would be fired." (Doc. No. 1 at 10). Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot prove the prima facie elements for IIED, because Plaintiff cannot meet the standard for "outrageous conduct." (Doc. No. 26 at 20-21).
To establish intentional inflection of emotional distress a plaintiff must show "... defendant's conduct was (1) intentional or reckless, (2) so outrageous that it is not tolerated by civilized society, and (3) resulted in serious mental injury to the plaintiff." Grace v. Cty. of Ripley, Tennessee, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29327, 2017 WL 835206 at *9 (W.D. Tenn. 2017) (quoting Odom v. Claiborne Cty., Tennessee, 498 S.W.3d 882, 886 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2016)). When confronted with a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a court must determine whether the defendant's conduct [*19]  can reasonably be regarded as outrageous and extreme. Clark v. Hoops, LP, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129584, 2008 WL 11320001 at *3 (W.D. Tenn. 2008). The standard for outrageous conduct is high and only conduct that is "atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community" can meet the burden for intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Garreston v. Cty. of Madison Heights, 407 F.3d 789, 799 (6th Cir. 2005).9
Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot show any conduct that is outrageous in character as to go beyond all bounds of decency. (Doc. No. 26 at 22) (citing Dillingham v. Millsaps, 809 F. Supp. 2d 820, 856 (E.D. Tenn. 2011)). Defendant argues that even if Plaintiff's allegations are true, they fall short of the standard required to establish outrage. (Id.). Plaintiff responds that he left the plant crying and distraught after a supervisor would not let him take and aspirin, an HR representative compared kidney failure to a stomach-ache, and told him they would terminate him if he was one second late. (Doc. No. 33 at 16). Plaintiff alleges Defendant's actions constitutes outrageous conduct, and he was terminated because he was too emotional to continue a meeting. (Id.).
The Court finds no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous, and Plaintiff presents no facts to show serious mental injury. (Doc. No. 34 ¶ 28).10 Therefore, the Court GRANTS [*20]  Defendant's motion as to Count V for IIED.
It is so ORDERED.
