Opinion


REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
In this employment discrimination case, Jessica Smith ("Plaintiff") is suing her former employer, Haynes Incorporated ("Defendant" or "Haynes"). Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12102, et seq., as amended ("ADA"): (1) discrimination; (2) hostile work environment; and (3) retaliation. This matter comes before the court on Defendant's motion for summary judgment. [ECF No. 20]. This matter having been fully briefed [ECF Nos. 26, 31], it is ripe for disposition.
All pretrial proceedings in this case were referred to the undersigned pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) and Local Civ. Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g) (D.S.C.). Because the motion for summary judgment is dispositive, this report and recommendation is entered for the district judge's consideration. For the reasons that follow, the undersigned recommends the district judge grant Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
I. Factual Background
 [*2] Haynes is a consulting and services firm and is the prime contractor for the U.S. Department of State's Global Financial Services Center (the "Department"). Young Aff. at ¶¶ 3-4. Haynes Program Manager, Nicole Young, oversees the Haynes' divisions that service the Department, such as the Office of Claims. Id. at ¶ 5. Merton Teixeira is the Assistant Project Manager who oversees the Office of Claims. Within the Office of Claims, there are three divisions: (1) Employer Claims; (2) Vendor Claims; and (3) Audit Distribution Reporting ("ADR"). Id. at ¶ 5.
About November 23, 2009, Plaintiff began work at Haynes as an accounting clerk and in the summer of 2010, moved into vendor management under the ADR team, where she remained until her termination. Pl. Dep. at 54:5-13, 58:23-59:21. On the ADR team, Plaintiff worked as a vendor management accounting clerk, whose responsibilities included entering new vendors into the Global Financial Management System, maintaining and updating vendor records, preparing Form 1099 and 1099 database, tax reports, and working with and timely responding to customers inquires. Teixeira Aff. at ¶ 8.
In 2015, the Department expressed concerns to Haynes that management issues within the Office of Claims were impairing overall productivity. Young Dep. At 12:7-14. Young became Program Manager, with a serious directive from the Department to conduct a needs and assessment study on Haynes' staff, to [*3]  review and improve organization, address employee relation issues, streamline labor, and realign and redevelop business practices within the organization. Young Dep. at 12:16-19, 13:6-11. Young completed an initial assessment of the Office of Claims and identified several areas of improvement, including working with individual employees to address performance and conduct issues, and promoting effective communication through establishment of a clear chain of command. Young Dep. at 12:4-14:10; ECF No. 20-3 at 2-4. Young identified Plaintiff as one of several employees who was not meeting performance expectations, noting that she "[h]as a poor attitude, can be defensive and argumentative with co-workers . . . not a team player, won't document job duties using QMS or share knowledge, spends excessive time away from her desk (goes to her spouses office a lot on the clock)." Id. at 3. As a result of this assessment, Haynes management circulated a Policies and Procedures Memorandum to all staff in the Office of Claims, outlining and clarifying specific expectations and procedures. Young Dep. at 14:16-24; ECF No. 20-7 at ¶¶ 1, 2, 6, 7 and 12. Among other issues addressed in this memorandum, Haynes [*4]  management clarified its policy and proper procedure for core work hours, set arrival time, attending meetings, taking lunch breaks in excess of the allotted 45 minutes, taking breaks throughout the work day, and the calling in process to be used when an employee is sick or running late. Id.
On June 16, 2016, Young notified employees that Haynes was going to designate Team Leads to whom employees would report rather than Teixeira to help streamline communications and issue resolution. [ECF No. 20-4]. Paula Urdaneta was named as the Team Lead for the ADR team. Id. The Team Leads were charged with (1) managing personnel in their divisions, including coaching, guidance, monitoring personnel schedules, training, and enforcement of policies; and (2) acting as a liaison between the Department and their team employees. Id. Haynes also established positions for Assistant Team Leads (also referred to in the documents as Subject Matter Experts ("SMEs")). [ECF No. 20-11]. Qualities and characteristics imperative to these positions were "[p]rofessionalism, dependability, honesty, a positive attitude/optimism and should set the bar high with high levels of integrity, work ethic and top-notch communication [*5]  skills [face-to-face and written.]" Id. at 2. The notice indicated that leadership and management capabilities were required for this role. Id.
Plaintiff applied for the Assistant Lead Position for vendor management, but the position was awarded to Justin Blackmon, an adept voucher examiner with experience in the debt collection division, who Haynes believed exhibited good leadership qualities and skills. Teixeira Dep. at p. 18:18-21; Young Dep. at p. 25:9-12.

July 20, 2016 Meeting
While Plaintiff's application for the Assistant Team Lead was pending, Urdaneta asked her to create a complete summary of her QWI1 process for processing 1099 tax forms for the Department in preparation for an audit, with a deadline of close of business that day. [ECF No. 20-12]. Defendant states Plaintiff produced piecemeal, incomplete work product. Id. In response to Urdaneta's follow-up request for complete work product, Plaintiff replied, "I don't understand what you want. Can you just do it the way you want it done??" Id. at p. 8. Urdaneta clarified that she was requesting Plaintiff review the QWI process that Urdaneta had drafted to add missing and necessary information at which point Plaintiff responded: "I have done EVERYTHING [*6]  that you have asked for...I do not understand WHAT ELSE you want done!" Id. Plaintiff's response to Urdaneta prompted Young to call a meeting for July 20, 2016, with Plaintiff, Urdaneta, Teixeira, and Young to address Plaintiff's behavior and discuss ways to prevent similar scenarios from arising in the future. Id. at 6; Urdaneta Dep. at 55:20-25. In advance of the meeting, Young provided detailed feedback to Plaintiff on the problematic aspects of her e-mails and communications. Id. During the July 20 meeting, Plaintiff informed the participants that she had anxiety. Pl. Dep. 101:8-10, 104:3-8. Young asked Plaintiff what Haynes could do to help with her anxiety, but Plaintiff responded that it was unpredictable, although she identified that being interrupted could be a trigger. Id. Plaintiff did not indicate that Urdaneta triggered her anxiety, nor did she request any accommodation for her anxiety. Id.; Young Dep. at 28:12-18. They discussed ways to address communications and inquiries going forward, and Plaintiff left the meeting feeling as though she could move forward with a positive work attitude. Pl. Dep. at 101:10-102:18; 107:10-13. Plaintiff expressed appreciation that management brought [*7]  these issues to her attention so that she could work to remedy them. Pl. Dep. at 102:10-14. Following the meeting, Young had the impression that they had reached a resolution with Plaintiff and Urdaneta, with goals and take-aways for both. Young Dep. 30:3-20.

Continuing Problems
After the July 20, 2016 meeting, Defendant continued to have difficulty managing Plaintiff. Young testified she was informed that Plaintiff was taking extended lunches with her husband, who worked at the Department, without obtaining approval ahead of time, as required in the policy memorandum Haynes had circulated in the months prior. Young Dep. at 15:19-16:13. Additionally, Young was advised that Plaintiff was taking extended smoke breaks throughout the day while still billing, despite Haynes' having made clear that breaks could not billed to the client. Id. Plaintiff also bypassed Urdaneta and made requests directly to Teixeira. Pl. Dep. at 126:7-24; ECF No. 20-13. Plaintiff emailed Teixeira and requested to adjust her daily schedule to arrive around 6:45 a.m. and depart around 3:30 p.m. At Teixeira's prompting, Plaintiff sent the request to Urdaneta, who stated she would permit an arrival time of 7:45 a.m. [*8]  Id. Plaintiff responded:
My husband and I ride in to work together and he has already altered his schedule. I've spoken with him and he advised that a 7:00 start time would work with him and his office. As I don't have an alternate mode of transportation, I will need to come in from 7:00-3:45.
[ECF No. 20-15]. Teixeira counseled Plaintiff on the proper protocol for requesting such changes, and followed up this conversation by e-mail on October 20, 2016. [ECF No. 20-16]. Teixeira reminded Plaintiff that "[a]ll requested schedule changes . . . should go through your Team Lead, Paula Urdaneta." Id. Less than two weeks later, Plaintiff again e-mailed Teixeira, not Urdaneta, to request a change in her smoke breaks. [ECF No. 20-17].
Another coworker in the neighboring cubicle complained that she always felt obliged to contact Plaintiff through e-mail even though they sat right next to one another. Blackmon Dep. at p. 23:11-18. Blackmon, the Assistant Team Lead, noted a sense of hostility each time he interacted with Plaintiff. Id. at 18:16-19:4. In November 2016, Blackmon sent a questionnaire to members of his team in advance of one-on-one meetings with each of them, in hopes of eliciting how [*9]  each team member regarded his or her role and the working environment in general. Plaintiff returned an incomplete response, with only sarcastic images or memes as answers. [ECF No. 20-20]. The responses included:



Plaintiff eventually provided a completed questionnaire, indicating: (1) she did not need help with any of her long term goals; (2) she did not need assistance with any situation; (3) her job was what she expected when she accepted it; (4) she felt adequately valued; (5) she enjoyed all aspects of her position; (6) the work environment was suitable for her team's mission and requirements; and (7) that "everything is fine." [ECF No. 20-23]. During her deposition, Plaintiff affirmed that these answers were accurate and that she would not change them. Pl. Dep. at 148:3-12.
On December 6, 2016, when Blackmon shared with her that her coworkers found her unapproachable, Plaintiff responded that "they really shouldn't be approaching me right now, because all the e-mail requests are being monitored and if someone comes to me and asks me to do something, I'm not going to get credit for it." Pl. Dep. at 149:7-12.
Plaintiff's communication issues came to a head on December 7, 8, and [*10]  9, 2016, when she called out of work. Initially, Plaintiff notified Teixeira that she would be out of work, in clear conflict with the instructions she had received on several previous occasions to report to Urdaneta. [ECF No. 20-21]. Teixeira instructed Plaintiff to contact Urdaneta or Blackmon, to which Plaintiff responded that she would not call Urdaneta because she triggered anxiety and did not have Blackmon's contact information. Id. Teixeira permitted Plaintiff to contact the administrative assistant to report her absence, rather than requiring her to comply with the chain of command procedure. Pl. Dep. at 154:15-155:7.
Concerned about Plaintiff's refusal to deal with her Team Lead, Teixeira called Plaintiff, at which point she informed him that she could no longer work under Urdaneta and that she wished to be placed in another division so that she would have another team leader. Teixeira Aff. at ¶ 12. At the time, Plaintiff reported to Teixeira that she was being subjected to a hostile work environment because she felt her performance was being closely monitored and that none of her coworkers liked her and were complaining about her. Id.
Haynes could not satisfy Plaintiff's ultimatum [*11]  that she not work with Urdaneta. Teixeira explained that he could not move Plaintiff. Teixeira Dep. at p. 24:15-22. Teixeira specifically noted there were no open positions under the other Team Leader and that the other team required a different skill set from its accounting clerks. Teixera Dep. at 24:23-24. Haynes' management ultimately made the business decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment because of her unsatisfactory job performance and attitude issues, effective December 29, 2016. [ECF No. 20-28].
II. Discussion
A. Standard on Summary Judgment
The court shall grant summary judgment "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears the initial burden of demonstrating that summary judgment is appropriate; if the movant carries its burden, then the burden shifts to the non-movant to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If a movant asserts that a fact cannot be disputed, it must support that assertion either by "citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, [*12]  affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials;" or "showing . . . that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).
In considering a motion for summary judgment, the evidence of the non-moving party is to be believed and all justifiable inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). However, "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. at 248.
B. Analysis
1. Failure to Accommodate
To establish a prima facie failure-to-accommodate claim, a plaintiff must allege facts showing: "(1) that [she] was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of [her] disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation she could perform the essential functions of the position . . . ; (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations." Rhoads v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 257 F.3d 373, 387, n. 11 (4th Cir. 2001) (citing Mitchell v. Washingtonville Cent. Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 1, 6 (2nd Cir. 1999)).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff was not a qualified individual with a disability [*13]  because she could not perform an essential function of her job—reporting to Urdaneta. Because the issue is also related to whether Defendant made a reasonable accommodation, the undersigned assumes without deciding that Plaintiff was a qualified individual with a disability for purposes of this claim. In her deposition, Plaintiff testified that the only accommodation she requested of Haynes was to work under another supervisor. Pl. Dep. 42:9-25. Defendant argues this was not a reasonable accommodation, as the only other team leader led a team with different work functions and requirements and there were no available positions on that team. Young Aff. at ¶ 12, Teixeira Aff. at ¶¶ 6, 12. The undersigned finds that a request to choose to whom one reports is not a reasonable accommodation under these circumstances. See e.g., Gaul v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 134 F.3d 576, 579 (3d Cir. 1998) (holding that "request to be transferred away from individuals causing . . . prolonged and inordinate stress" by plaintiff with obsessive/compulsive disorder "was unreasonable as a matter of law under the ADA"); Theilig v. United Tech Corp., 415 F. App'x 331, 333 (2d Cir. 2011) (unpublished) ("While there is no per se rule against a change in supervisor, '[t]here is a presumption . . . that a request to change supervisors is unreasonable, [*14]  and the burden of overcoming that presumption (i.e., of demonstrating that, within the particular context of the plaintiff's workplace, the request was reasonable) therefore lies with the plaintiff.'" (quoting Kennedy v. Dresser Rand Co., 193 F.3d 120, 122-23 (2d Cir.1999)); Cardenas-Meade v. Pfizer, Inc., 510 F. App'x 367, 372 (6th Cir. 2013) (unpublished) ("[W]hile a reasonable accommodation under the ADA does include 'reassignment to a vacant position,' 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B), requests for re-assignment to a new supervisor are disfavored."); Schneider v. Giant of Md., LLC, 389 F. App'x 263, 271 (4th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted) (per curiam) (holding "the ADA does not require reassignment 'when it would mandate that the employer bump another employee out of a particular position.'") (quoting E.E.O.C. v. Sara Lee Corp., 237 F.3d 349, 355 (4th Cir. 2001)).
To the extent Plaintiff argues Defendant did not engage in the interactive process, the evidence reveals otherwise. When Plaintiff first informed Defendant of her anxiety, Young asked what Defendant could do to help her and asked if she had any triggers. Pl. Dep. 101:8-10, 104:3-8. Additionally, when Plaintiff told Teixeira that she was triggered by training Blackmon at her cubicle, Defendant arranged for them to use a conference room. Teixeira Dep. at 26:10-27:1. Contrary to Plaintiff's arguments, the evidence shows that Defendant worked with Plaintiff to provide reasonable accommodations when Plaintiff requested, [*15]  and refused only when Plaintiff demanded to be reassigned to another Team Lead. The undersigned recommends Defendant be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim.
2. Wrongful Discharge/Discrimination Based on Disability
Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual with a disability because interacting with Urdaneta is an essential function of her job and Plaintiff advised that she was unable to perform it. Plaintiff argues that interacting with Urdaneta was not essential, as Plaintiff had been performing the job for the prior six years without reporting to Urdaneta. While Plaintiff may have previously performed the job without reporting to Urdaneta, Plaintiff's willingness to report to the person designated by Defendant was always an essential function of her job. Here, the importance of this requirement is highlighted by the fact that the change in chain of command was made to correct prior problems identified in the department. See Wenick v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., 91 F.3d 379, 384 (2d Cir. 1996) (finding that nothing in the record contradicted Defendant's conclusion that one of the essential functions of plaintiff's job was to work for her assigned supervisor); EEOC v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 147 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that court's inquiry into essential [*16]  functions is not intended to second-guess employer's business judgment). Therefore, the undersigned agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff has not shown she is a qualified individual under the ADA for purposes of her discriminatory discharge claim.
3. Discrimination Related to Assistant Team Lead Position
Plaintiff claims that Defendant's promotion of Blackmon instead of her for Assistant Team Lead was discriminatory. To state a prima facie case of discriminatory failure to promote, Plaintiff must prove: (1) she is a member of a protected group, (2) she applied for the position in question, (3) she was qualified for that position, and (4) the defendant rejected her application under circumstances that give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. Anderson v. Westinghuse Savannah River Co., 406 F.3d 248, 268 (4th Cir. 2005).
Defendant claims that Plaintiff's attitude problems made her unqualified for the position. Defendant specifically cites, in addition to the required experience and technical skill sets "Professionalism, dependability, honesty, a positive attitude/optimism and should set the bar high with high levels of integrity, work ethic and top-notch communication skills [face-to-face and written.]." [ECF No. 20-11]. Plaintiff argues she was most [*17]  qualified for the position because she had already been performing the job functions and trained Blackmon, who was ultimately awarded the position. Plaintiff does not provide any argument that the failure to promote her occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. However, the undersigned notes that Plaintiff advised Defendant of her disability on July 20, 2016, and Blackmon was awarded the position on August 18, 2016. Because of the temporal proximity, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has narrowly set forth sufficient evidence to set forth a prima facie case.
Defendant has proffered a non-discriminatory reason for its decision to not select Plaintiff as Assistant Team Lead—Blackmon was better qualified because he exhibited the leadership qualities and skills needed—skills that Plaintiff had specifically been identified as lacking before the position was announced.
Plaintiff argues Defendant's lack of multiple, recent, and specific examples of her poor attitude, combined with Blackmon's lack of management experience demonstrate Defendant's reason is pretext for discrimination.
However, Plaintiff was identified as having a poor attitude, being [*18]  argumentative, and not being a team player in the March 10, 2016 needs assessment report, before Plaintiff advised Defendant of her disability. [ECF No. 20-6]. Additionally, the leadership requirements for the position of Assistant Team Leader were also posted before Plaintiff informed Defendant of her disability. [ECF No. 20-11]. Plaintiff's arguments regarding pretext do not provide any basis for finding that Defendant's reason was discriminatory. Rather, Plaintiff simply believes she was more qualified. This court has previously refused to substitute its judgment of applicants' qualifications for a defendant's:
Through his qualifications argument, Plaintiff is asking the court to impermissibly sit as a super personnel department and substitute Plaintiff's opinions regarding his qualifications for the judgment of [Defendant]. See Anderson v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 406 F.3d 248, 272 (4th Cir. 2005) (holding it is not appropriate for the court to "sit as a super-personnel department weighing the prudence of employment decisions made by the defendants"); DeJarnette v. Corning, Inc., 133 F.3d 293, 299 (4th Cir. 1998) (same); Jiminez v. Mary Washington Coll., 57 F.3d 369, 377 (4th Cir. 1995) (holding Title VII is not a vehicle for substituting the judgment of a court for that of the employer). [emphasis supplied].
Daniel v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Environmental Control, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79232, 2014 WL 2604532, *12 (D.S.C. Jun. 11, 2014); see also Hammett v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Environmental Control, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46896, 2013 WL 1316440, *7 (D.S.C. Jan. 25, 2013) ("In fact, 'the law does not require an employer to make, [*19]  in the first instance, employment choices that are wise, rational, or even well-considered, as long as they are nondiscriminatory.'" [citations omitted]), adopted, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45235, 2013 WL 1316434 (D.S.C. Mar. 28, 2013). Although Plaintiff advised Defendant of her anxiety on July 20, 2016—a month prior to Defendant's rejection of her application for the position—it is significant that the July 20 meeting was called to discuss Plaintiff's problems with communicating with her Team Leader. The undersigned finds that no reasonable juror could find that Defendant's selection of Blackmon instead of Plaintiff was based on her disability, and recommends Defendant be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure-to-promote claim.
4. Retaliation
The ADA prohibits retaliation by an employer against an employee who opposes any practice made unlawful by the ADA. 42 U.S.C.A. § 12203(a). To prevail on a retaliation claim, the employee must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) her employer took an adverse employment action against her; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Id.; Rhoads v. FDIC, 257 F.3d 373, 392 (4th Cir. 2001). "Since, by definition, an employer cannot take action because [*20]  of a factor of which it is unaware, the employer's knowledge that the plaintiff engaged in a protected activity is absolutely necessary to establish the third element of the prima facie case." Dowe v. Total Action AgainstPoverty in Roanoke Valley, 145 F.3d 653, 657 (4th Cir. 1998).
If the plaintiff satisfies this burden, then her employer must articulate a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for its action. Id. Once the employer meets this burden of production, the plaintiff must show that the employer's articulated reason is pretext for forbidden retaliation. Id.
First, Plaintiff has not identified any particular protected activity in which she engaged. Although Plaintiff alleges incidents of complaints to Teixeira of "hostile work environment" or that Urdaneta was "targeting" her, Plaintiff has cited to no record evidence showing that she advised management that she believed the alleged hostile work environment was based on her disability.2 Therefore, Plaintiff has not shown that she made complaints of disability discrimination or engaged in other protected activity.
Even if Plaintiff could make a prima facie case that her termination was retaliation for her complaints about Urdaneta,3 Defendant has set for a non-retaliatory reason for her termination. Defendant states Plaintiff [*21]  was terminated because: (1) she had unsatisfactory attitude and performance issues and (2) refused or was unable to perform an essential function of her job, interacting with Urdaneta.
The burden then shifts to Plaintiff to show that Defendant's proffered reasons are pretext for retaliation. Plaintiff argues that Defendant's reasons are pretextual because: (1) she was never formally counseled for performance issues and (2) she was not specifically informed that failure to improve her performance would result in termination. However, Plaintiff does not deny that she had informal counseling about her attitude, even after management met with her on July 20, 2016, to discuss unsatisfactory communication issues. Further, Plaintiff does not deny that she refused to report to Urdaneta. An employer is not required to subject its workforce to an individual's abrasive behavior, even where the behavior is related to a disability. Jones v. Am. Postal Workers Union Nat'l, 192 F.3d 417, 429 (4th Cir. 1999) ("The law is well settled that the ADA is not violated when an employer discharges an individual based upon the employee's misconduct, even if the misconduct is related to a disability."); Darcangelo v. Verizon Md., Inc., 189 F. App'x 217, 219 (4th Cir. 2006) ("However, the ADA does not require [defendant's] to subject its employees to [*22]  [plaintiff's] abusive behavior, which, not surprisingly, created considerable anxiety within her work environment, even if that behavior was related to her bipolar disorder."). Therefore, the undersigned recommends Defendant be granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's retaliation claims.
5. Hostile Work Environment
To establish a hostile work environment claim pursuant to the ADA, Plaintiff must present evidence that: (1) she is a qualified person with a disability; (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her disability; (4) the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter her condition of employment and to create an abusive work environment; and (5) the conduct is imputable on some factual basis to her employer. Mason v. Wyeth, 183 F. App'x 353, 360-61 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Fox v. Gen. Motors Corp., 247 F.3d 169, 176-77 (4th Cir. 2001)).
Plaintiff has not shown that any alleged unwelcome conduct was attributable to his disability or that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive. In support of her hostile work environment claim, Plaintiff points to the following unwelcome conduct: (1) she was called into a meeting with Young, Teixeira, and Urdaneta; (2) she was "berated" about her start time and when she asked for a change in start time; (3) she [*23]  was denied a promotion; (4) Teixeira told her that her complaints about a hostile work environment were only because she had been denied a promotion; (5) Defendant did not let her choose her exact start time when she requested; (6) Blackmon questioned her about her service to a customer; and (7) Defendant changed her email access. [ECF No. 26 at 33]. None of these alleged actions are based on Plaintiff's disability. To the extent Plaintiff alleges these actions were secretly based on her disability, she appears to be conflating a claim for disability discrimination that lacks an appropriately serious adverse employment action with a claim of hostile work environment. Plaintiff's claim of discrimination does not convert every unfavorable decision Defendant made as harassment attributable to her disability.
The actions are also not sufficiently severe and pervasive to support a claim for hostile work environment. To establish that the conduct was severe or pervasive, Plaintiff must show that the work environment was not only subjectively hostile, but also objectively so. See Sunbelt Rentals, Inc., 521 F.3d at 315. Such proof depends upon the totality of the circumstances, including "'the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; [*24]  its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'" Id. (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). "[C]omplaints premised on nothing more than 'rude treatment by [coworkers],' Baqir v. Principi, 434 F.3d 733, 747 (4th Cir. 2006), 'callous behavior by [one's] superiors,' Bass v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 324 F.3d 761, 765 (4th Cir. 2003), or 'a routine difference of opinion and personality conflict with [one's] supervisor,' Hawkins v.
