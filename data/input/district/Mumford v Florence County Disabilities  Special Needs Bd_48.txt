I. Factual overview2
A. Overview of FCDSNB
As explained by its Human Resources Employee Relations Administrator, Glenda Hyman-Singletary (a 55-year-old female), FCDSNB provides services to individuals with disabilities and special needs in the Florence County area. Aff. of Glenda Hyman-Singletary ("Hyman Aff.") ¶¶ 1, 5, ECF No. 46-15. FCDSNB serves over 1,000 of these individuals, which FCDSNB refers to as "consumers," providing a variety of services and programs that include day services, employment opportunities, residential services, leisure activities, and family support services. Id. ¶ 5. FCDSNB receives approximately 90% of its funding from and operates through contracts with the South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (hereinafter "SCDDSN"), the state agency charged with planning, developing, overseeing, and funding services for South Carolinians with severe, lifelong disabilities of intellectual disability, autism, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury and conditions related to each of these disabilities. Id. ¶ 6; Tr. of Hyman-Singletary Dep. ("Hyman Dep.") 13, [*3]  ECF No. 46-19. As part of its oversight of FCDSNB, SCDDSN subcontracts with Alliant AOS to audit FCDSNB's adherence to required standards. Id. at 12-13; Hyman Aff. ¶ 7.
B. Plaintiff's Employment as a Vocational Specialist
On February 1, 2002, Plaintiff began her employment with FCDSNB as a part-time Vocational Specialist. Tr. of Pl. Dep. ("Pl. Dep.") 42, ECF No. 46-17. Born in 1973, Plaintiff was approximately 45 years old when she left FCDSNB's employ in 2018. Pl. Dep. 14. Plaintiff read and reviewed FCDSNB's Employee Handbook and its policies, including those prohibiting unlawful discrimination and retaliation based on disability, age, or any other protected status. Plaintiff understood that she was an at-will employee of FCDSNB. See Employee Manual and Pl. Acknowledgements, ECF Nos. 46-2, 46-3; see also Pl. Dep. 46.
Plaintiff became a full-time Vocational Specialist in approximately 2004 or 2005. Pl. Dep. 42-44. She remained in that position throughout her employment at FCDSNB, although she worked in different facilities at different times. Pl. Dep. 46-47. As of 2015, Plaintiff was a Vocational Specialist working in the Braxton Collins Center. Id. at 47. Floor Supervisor Billy Wilson, a 61-year-old white [*4]  male, was Plaintiff's direct supervisor and had the authority to hire, fire, and discipline Vocational Specialists, including Plaintiff, with ultimate approval from Dawn Johnson, a 54-year-old female and the Executive Director of the FCDSNB. Pl. Dep. 54, 96; Hyman Aff. ¶ 11; Affidavit of Billy Wilson ("Wilson Aff.") ¶ 1, ECF No. 46-16.
As a Vocational Specialist, Plaintiff worked with the FCDSNB consumers to provide training for jobs to get them ready for the "real working world." Pl. Dep. 47. Plaintiff's job description for the Vocational Specialist Position, which she received and signed prior to her termination and as recently as June 2015, specifically described, in pertinent part, her duties and responsibilities to include the following:
1. Participates and instructs all disabled individuals in programmed activities and provides supervision to all individuals constantly, reports and documents all unusual occurrences to the Supervisor. Maintains and documents appropriate individual program information as required in the SCDDSN "Program Standards" Manual.
Vocational Specialist Job Description, ECF No. 46-4; Pl. Dep. 49-50. In her deposition, Plaintiff agreed that keeping accurate consumer [*5]  paperwork is an important part of a Vocational Specialist's job and one who is not keeping accurate paperwork would not be meeting the expectations of their position. Pl. Dep. 52. Plaintiff acknowledged that paperwork errors constituted deficient performance, and errors in paperwork could subject FCDSNB to consequences from SCDDSN. Id. at 51-52. Plaintiff's direct supervisor, Wilson, also noted the critical role Vocational Specialists play in completing and maintaining accurate and complete consumer paperwork, including correcting any errors and omissions in a timely manner. Wilson Aff. ¶ 5.
Plaintiff worked in conjunction with Habilitation Manager Deondray Greene, a 27-yearold female who was assigned to the Braxton Collins Center in October 2017. Tr. of Greene Dep. ("Greene Dep.") 7-8, ECF No. 46-18. Habilitation Managers are responsible for yearly habilitation plans for consumers and for monitoring consumer's monthly documentation. Id. HR Administrator Hyman explained that the role of a "habilitation manager" was "parallel" to that of a Vocational Specialist such as Plaintiff. Hyman Dep. 18-19. Hyman testified that Habilitation Managers have no supervisory authority over Vocational Specialists. [*6]  Hyman Aff. ¶ 13.3
C. Internal Audits of Consumer Paperwork
FCDSNB contracts with an outside consultant, Kathy Ham, to perform internal audits on the consumer paperwork in an effort to identify and correct any errors prior to SCDDSN's Alliant AOS review. Hyman Aff. ¶ 14, Hyman Dep. 14-15. Ham audits consumer files for errors and deficiencies, without regard to which Vocational Specialist is assigned to a particular consumer file. Hyman Aff. ¶ 15, Hyman Dep. 14-15. Upon identifying errors or omissions in a file, the file is matched to the responsible Vocational Specialist, and Ham consults with the Vocational Specialist as well as the Habilitation Manager in order to identify and encourage correction and completion of the errors or omissions. Hyman Aff. ¶ 15, Hyman Dep. 14-17. Ham also audits the paperwork of Habilitation Specialists. Hyman Aff. ¶ 14.
D. Plaintiff's FMLA Leave
Plaintiff had requested and received FMLA several times throughout her employment with FCDSNB. She acknowledged that, prior to her May 2016 FMLA leave, FCDSNB facilitated her prior FMLA leave without incident and did not interfere with or retaliate against Plaintiff relating to the leave. Pl. Dep. 140-41. Relevant [*7]  to her Amended Complaint, Plaintiff requested FMLA leave beginning on May 9, 2016 so that she could provide care to her mother, who was battling a serious health condition. Pl. Dep. 123-24; FMLA Leave Request, ECF No. 46-5. FCDSNB approved this FMLA leave, and Plaintiff returned from her FMLA leave on or around May 23, 2016. Hyman Aff. ¶ 18.
While Plaintiff was out on FMLA leave in May 2016, paperwork relating to the consumers assigned to her needed to be maintained in order to comply with SCDDSN standards. Other Vocational Specialists assisted in managing Plaintiff's paperwork for the several weeks she was out on leave. Hyman Aff. ¶ 19; Wilson Aff. ¶¶ 8-9.
E. Plaintiff's work performance
In 2015, Plaintiff received a "meets expectations" evaluation. Hyman Dep. 69, ECF No. 49-10.
The next information in the record concerning Plaintiff's work performance is a November 2, 2017 handwritten memorandum from quality assurance consultant Ham to Johnson and Hyman concerning Ham's quality-assurance audit of Plaintiff's paperwork. Nov. 2, 2017 Mem., ECF No. 46-6. In that memorandum, Ham mentions several omissions (missing signatures) on some of Plaintiff's paperwork. Ham explains that she had met [*8]  with Plaintiff about having the signatures obtained and that Plaintiff had obtained some, but not all, of the missing signatures. Ham states that she and Greene had again met with Plaintiff on November 2, 2017 to go over the issues with files that Plaintiff had not yet corrected. Id. at 2. Attached to the November 2, 2017 memorandum are Ham's notes of October 31, 2017 listing specific deficiencies in a particular file of Plaintiff. Id. at 3.
Plaintiff received a "Warning Notice" Employee Disciplinary Action Report on November 8, 2017. ECF No. 46-7. The Warning Notice was signed by Plaintiff's Supervisor, Wilson; HR Representative, Hyman; and Plaintiff. Id. at 2; Pl. Dep. 70-72; Wilson Aff. ¶ 10. The discipline was issued because "[d]uring this rating period, [Plaintiff's] files continue to be incomplete and are not consistently maintained." Nov. 8, 2017 Warning Notice at 2. The Warning indicated Plaintiff should "utilize time more effectively; stay focus[ed]; establish a system." Id. In the space provided for Plaintiff's comments, Plaintiff indicated she was "very distracted" when she tried to complete her paperwork. She indicated she was trying hard to complete her paperwork in a timely manner "but was pull[ed] to go [*9]  other places that take [her] [Plaintiff's] attention away from it." Id. When asked in deposition, Plaintiff clarified that she believed that transporting consumers to various assignments was taking her attention away from completing her paperwork. Pl. Dep. 72-73, 77. Plaintiff acknowledges she never mentioned a disability or requested an accommodation in relation to the November 2017 disciplinary action. Id. at 92-93; see Wilson Aff. ¶ 12.
Wilson testified that Plaintiff's performance did not improve in 2018. Wilson Aff. ¶ 13. Plaintiff's paperwork continued to contain errors and omissions. Prior to June 2018 Wilson verbally counseled Plaintiff regarding issues with her paperwork, giving her opportunities to correct it. Plaintiff did not utilize those opportunities. Wilson was under the impression that Plaintiff "presented excuses to avoid completing her paperwork and would instead actively volunteer for other tasks[.]" Id. In Plaintiff's deposition she acknowledged that she was not performing satisfactorily in 2018 and that she had continued errors and/or omissions in her paperwork that put FCDSNB at risk. Pl. Dep. 78.
Wilson was on FMLA leave from early June 2018 through early August 2018. Wilson [*10]  Aff. ¶ 14. In a report dated July 26, 2018, Ham advised Johnson, Hyman, and Greene that Plaintiff's paperwork continued to have numerous errors and omissions. Hyman Aff. ¶ 26. Plaintiff was given a deadline of August 10, 2018 to complete and correct her paperwork. FCDSNB provided Plaintiff with multiple dates and times in early July 2018 and early August 2018 to correct and complete her deficient paperwork. Id. ¶ 27; Pl. Dep. 82-83; Wilson Aff. ¶ 15. Ham and Greene met with Plaintiff regarding completing her paperwork. Greene offered to assist with the paperwork, but Plaintiff declined her assistance. Pl. Dep. 89; Greene Dep. 18-19.
Wilson returned from FMLA leave on August 9, 2018, at which time he "learned that Plaintiff's performance remained deficient." Wilson Aff. ¶¶ 14-15. Plaintiff did not complete her paperwork corrections by August 10, 2018. Id. ¶ 15; Pl. Dep. 93. Rather, at 12:34 pm on August 10, 2018, Plaintiff sent a message to Johnson, Hyman, and Greene indicating that she had been unable to complete or correct all of her files by Noon that day. Aug. 10, 2018 Message, ECF No. 46-9. Plaintiff indicated she had understood that she had until the end of that day but that Greene [*11]  advised that Plaintiff's deadline had been at Noon on August 10, 2018. Id. Plaintiff noted that some files had a lot of errors to be corrected and it was not possible for her to complete the work by Noon. Id.; Pl. Dep. 91-92.
F. Plaintiff's complaint about Greene
On July 25, 2018, Plaintiff submitted a statement to Hyman regarding Greene. Plaintiff indicated she had been "belittle[d]" by Greene several times, making her feel "as if [she] was bitten by a snake." July 25, 2018 Statement, ECF No. 46-10. Plaintiff indicated Greene's "leadership always make[s] ]her] feel like [she's] a victim instead of an[] employee." Id. Greene's demands and suggestion she would have to "babysit" staff had "affected [Plaintiff] mentally." Id. Plaintiff complained that she felt as if she was "going to be the next target" and hoped that things would be "handled in a more professional manner." Id.; Pl. Dep. 105-06. Plaintiff believed Greene spoke to her like she was a "child," even though Greene was the same age as Plaintiff's daughter. Pl. Dep. 105. Plaintiff also indicated in deposition that did not like that Greene had removed all of the rolling chairs in the facility and replaced them with chairs without [*12]  wheels. Pl. Dep. 106-08. Hyman noted that she had discussed this statement with Plaintiff around July 25, 2018, and that Plaintiff had never mentioned age, disability, or a hostile work environment at that time. Hyman Aff. ¶ 22.
Hyman also received statements concerning Greene's "belittling tone" from two other Vocational Specialists. Felisha Singletary (52-year-old female) and Allesia McNeil (56-year-old female) submitted statements to Hyman, dated July 19, 2018, and August 2, 2018, respectively. Hyman Aff. ¶ 23; see Statements, ECF No. 46-11. Both Singletary and McNeil commented about Greene's "babysitter" comment and her belittling comments. ECF No. 46-11. In response to these statements, Hyman informed Greene of general complaints regarding her tone and leadership and encouraged her to speak individually to each of the Vocational Specialists who had submitted statements. She did not show the statements to Greene. Hyman Aff. ¶ 24. Greene apologized to all three Vocational Specialists, and Hyman was never informed of any additional issues or problems with Greene's tone, delivery, or interaction with these Vocational Specialists. Id. ¶ 25.
G. Plaintiff's Administrative Leave, Termination, [*13]  and Appeal of Termination
After Plaintiff's failure to provide corrected, completed paperwork as of the August 10, 2018 deadline, and based on her issues with paperwork in 2017 and 2018, Plaintiff was placed on administrative leave. Hyman Aff. ¶ 29. Based on these issues, Plaintiff's direct supervisor, Wilson, recommended termination of Plaintiff's employment, effective August 16, 2018. Wilson Aff. ¶ 16. Dawn Johnson approved this recommendation. Id.
Wilson advised Plaintiff that, as of August 16, 2018, she was being separated from employment "for substandard performance and unacceptable work." Aug. 16, 2018 Mem. to Plaintiff, ECF No. 46-12. The August 16, 2018 writing noted the "substandard performance for documentation" based on recent review of Plaintiff's files. He further noted Plaintiff's failure to correct her files. Plaintiff was advised of her right to appeal her separation. Id.; see also Pl. Dep. 95 (acknowledging the contents of the August 16, 2018 letter). As of August 16, 2018, Plaintiff was no longer a FCDSNB employee. Hyman Aff. ¶ 31.
Plaintiff appealed her termination in accordance with FCDSNB policy. Pl. Dep. 97-99. The record includes Plaintiff's written notice of appeal. [*14]  Pl. Appeal (Aug. 21, 2018), ECF No. 49-11. Plaintiff indicates her appeal is "due to inconsistencies regarding [her] responsibilities for documentation and management of files." Id. at 1. She indicates there was no standard procedure for maintaining files and that she was never notified her employment was in jeopardy because of her filing methods. Plaintiff also indicates the following, "Due to being medically diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder, I wasn't aware that I could have asked for more reasonable accommodation to help me be focus[ed] more on [her] work." Id.4 Plaintiff asks FCDSNB to reverse her supervisor's decision to terminate her. Id. at 2.
As explained by Hyman, the appeal process involves an investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination by neutral, non-involved parties. Hyman Aff. ¶ 32. Mary Hyman, a Residential Administrator, and Kenneth James, a Residential Director, were assigned to Plaintiff's appeal. Neither had any prior knowledge or experience regarding the basis for Plaintiff's termination. Hyman Aff. ¶ 32. Mary Hyman and James conducted interviews of witnesses, including Plaintiff, and collected written statements as part of the appeal process. [*15]  Id. ¶ 33; Pl. Dep. 97. After completing their interviews Mary Hyman and James issued their "Appeal Review Conclusion," indicating they believed termination was warranted. Appeal Conclusion, ECF No. 46-13. Mary Hyman and James indicated Plaintiff had been "given ample amount of time to complete her work, and chose not to complete it." Id. They noted that Plaintiff "stated she wasn't accommodated with her diagnosis of Attention Deficit Disorder." Their Conclusion continued, "[Plaintiff's] current supervisor nor Human Resources had written documentation of the diagnosis." Id. They also noted that Plaintiff had been given ample opportunity to complete her paperwork and correct errors. Id.
In a letter dated September 6, 2018, Johnson advised Plaintiff that she had "rendered the decision to uphold [her] termination." Appeal Determination, ECF No. 46-14.
After filing an administrative charge and obtaining a Right to Sue Letter, Plaintiff filed her Complaint on June 17, 2019.
II. Standard of Review
The court shall grant summary judgment "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears [*16]  the initial burden of demonstrating that summary judgment is appropriate; if the movant carries its burden, then the burden shifts to the non-movant to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If a movant asserts that a fact cannot be disputed, it must support that assertion either by "citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials;" or "showing . . . that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).
In considering a motion for summary judgment, the evidence of the non-moving party is to be believed and all justifiable inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). However, "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. at 248. All that is required is that "sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual [*17]  dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. "Mere unsupported speculation . . . is not enough to defeat a summary judgment motion." Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'n of Bus. & Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 62 (4th Cir. 1995). A party cannot create a genuine issue of material fact solely with conclusions in his or her own affidavit or deposition that are not based on personal knowledge. See Latif v. The Cmty. Coll. of Baltimore, 354 F. App'x 828, 830 (4th Cir. 2009) (affirming district court's grant of summary judgment, noting plaintiff's affidavit, which offered conclusions not based on his own knowledge, did not create genuine issues of material fact). In discrimination cases, a party is entitled to summary judgment if no reasonable jury could rule in the non-moving party's favor. Dennis v. Columbia Colleton Med. Ctr., Inc., 290 F.3d 639, 645 (4th Cir. 2002) (Title VII). The court cannot make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence, but the court should examine uncontradicted and unimpeached evidence offered by the moving party. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). The court must determine whether a party's offered evidence is legally sufficient to support a finding of discrimination and look at the strength of a party's case on its own terms. See id. at 148 (stating that "[c]ertainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient [*18]  evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no rational fact-finder could conclude that the action was discriminatory").
III. Analysis
A. Plaintiff's ADA claims
The ADA provides in part that an employer may not "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(2), 12112(a). The ADA Amendments Act ("ADAAA"), effective January 1, 2009, informed the court's interpretation of certain aspects of the ADA, particularly regarding whether an impairment is considered a "disability" for purposes of ADA-based protections. At bottom, the court is mindful that the "primary purpose of the [ADA] Amendments Act was to make it easier for people with disabilities to obtain protection under the ADA." Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the ADA, 29 C.F.R. § Pt. 1630, App. (Section 1631.01(c) Construction).
Violations of the ADA occur when the employer either wrongfully discharges a qualified individual with a disability or fails to make reasonable accommodations for her. Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n.11 (4th Cir. 2001). Defendant seeks summary judgment as to all of Plaintiff's [*19]  claims. Defendant seeks summary judgment as to the following ADA-based claims: (1) disability discrimination; (2) failure to accommodate; and (3) hostile work environment. Def. Mem. 15-25. The court considers these claims in turn.
1. Disability discrimination
Generally, there are "two avenues" by which a plaintiff may prove ADA-based discrimination. See Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., 354 F.3d 277, 285 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc). The first is to offer "direct or indirect evidence" of discrimination, under "ordinary principles of proof." Burns v. AA F-McQuay, Inc., 96 F.3d 728, 731 (4th Cir. 1996) (internal quotations omitted). The other method of proof is to follow the burden-shifting approach first articulated by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Ennis, 53 F.3d at 58; Chauncey v. Life Cycle Eng'g, Inc., No. 2:12-CV-968-DCN, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140579, 2013 WL 5468237, at *7 (D.S.C. Sept. 30, 2013) (considering ADA claims using burden-shifting analysis). Here, the parties analyze the ADA claims using the burden-shifting proof method.
At the first step of the McDonnell Douglas approach, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA if she demonstrates that (1) she was within the ADA's protected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) she was fulfilling her employer's legitimate expectations at the time of the adverse action; and (4) the circumstances surrounding the [*20]  adverse action "raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination." Reynolds v. Am. Nat'l Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 150 (4th Cir. 2012); Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., 252 F.3d 696, 702 (4th Cir. 2001). "Evidence of all four of these elements is necessary to survive summary judgment." Id. While intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back and forth, the ultimate burden of persuasion that the defendant engaged in intentional discrimination remains at all times with the plaintiff. See Reeves, 530 U.S. at 146-47 ("The ultimate question is whether the employer intentionally discriminated, and proof that 'the employer's proffered reason is unpersuasive, or even obviously contrived, does not necessarily establish that the plaintiff's proffered reason . . . is correct.'") (quoting St. Mary's Honor Center, 509 U.S. at 506). See also Ennis, 53 F.3d at 58 (citing St. Mary's Honor Center and noting the same in ADA context). Plaintiff must establish "but-for" causation in an ADA claim. Gentry v. E. W. Partners Club Mgmt. Co. Inc., 816 F.3d 228, 235-36 (4th Cir. 2016) ("The only remaining question is whether the ADA's text calls for a 'but-for' causation standard. We hold that it does.").
Generally, a plaintiff may satisfy the first element of an ADA claim—being an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA—by satisfying one of the ADA's three definitions of disability. "The term 'disability' means, with respect to an individual—"(A) a physical or mental impairment that [*21]  substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).5
Defendant challenges Plaintiff's ability to establish that she is an "individual with a disability" for purposes of her disability-discrimination claim. See Def. Mem. 16-17 (citing cases). As argued by Defendant, Plaintiff has not provided medical evidence of having ADD, nor has she provided evidence of specific restrictions showing how her alleged impairment/disability of ADD "substantially limits one or more of [her] major life activities," as contemplated by 42 U.S.C. § 12201(h). The ADA, as amended, provides:
For purposes of paragraph (1), major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.
42 U.S.C § 12102(2)(A).
In response to the argument that she has not established a disability, Plaintiff submits an exhibit she labels "Mumford Medical Condition Lists." ECF No. 49-5. These "Lists" are comprised of two medical records that are comprised of lists of [*22]  Plaintiff's various "problems," including "Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder," with an onset date of April 27, 2017. Id. Plaintiff also notes that, at the time Greene began working at FCDSNB Plaintiff advised her that she had ADD to which Green responded, "If you need my help, just let me know." Pl. Mem. 7 (citing Greene Dep. 19-20). Plaintiff notes Greene's testimony that she never shared her knowledge of Plaintiff's ADD condition with anyone else at FCDSNB. Id. (citing Greene Dep. 21-23). Nothing in these proffered records/lists or in Plaintiff's general conversation with Greene included any indication that limitations had been placed on Plaintiff as a result of her ADD diagnosis. This lack of medical evidence as to limitations is fatal to Plaintiff's demonstration of an ADA-qualifying disability. "A plaintiff must provide medical evidence, not just subjective opinion, of the effect that the impairment has on her activities." Wilson v. Carolina Power & Light Co., No. 4:05-3597-TLW-TER, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78849, 2009 WL 2885823, at *8 (D.S.C. Sept. 2, 2009) (plaintiff's affidavit and deposition testimony were "merely his subjective opinion and not medical evidence" and were insufficient to establish he had a disability as defined by the ADA) (citing [*23]  Pollard v. High's of Baltimore, 281 F.3d 462, 469-70, n.3 (4th Cir. 2002) and Stewart v. Weast, 228 F. Supp. 2d 660, 662 (D. Md. 2000)).
Plaintiff also fails to establish that her impairment affected a major life activity. Without any explanation or analysis, Plaintiff argues, "Clearly this disability affected Plaintiff's major life activity of working, as her inability to focus on file documentation lead to her termination." Id. Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence of an impairment that "substantially limits" the "major life activit[y]" of "working," as required by 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). Accepting, for argument's sake, that Plaintiff has shown she has an impairment that substantially limits her from "focusing on file documentation," the inability to perform the requirements of a particular job does not suffice. See Def. Reply 2. Regulatory guidance issued subsequent to the passage of the ADAAA provides the following:
Demonstrating a substantial limitation in performing the unique aspects of a single specific job is not sufficient to establish that a person is substantially limited in the major life activity of working.
29 C.F.R. § Pt. 1630, App. following sections 1630.2(j)(5) and (6), "Substantially Limited in Working." As the court noted in Lee v. Olsten Staffing Services Corp., No. 4:18-CV-02520-SAL, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146941, 2020 WL 4726738, at *3 (D.S.C. Aug. 14, 2020), "When the major life activity substantially limited [*24]  by an impairment is working, a plaintiff must show not merely that the impairment rendered him or her 'incapable of satisfying the singular demands of a particular job,' but that it 'foreclose[d] generally [her opportunity to obtain] the type of employment involved.'" (quoting Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 388 (4th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation omitted)). In other words, the "inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." Boitnott v. Corning, Inc., 669 F.3d 172, 174-75 (4th Cir. 2012). See also Allen v. SouthCrest Hosp., 455 F. App'x 827, 835 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § Pt. 1630, App and finding that the plaintiff, "even after the enactment of the [ADAAA] and the modified EEOC regulations" must show that she was "substantially limited in performing a class of jobs or broad range of jobs" in order to establish that she is substantially limited in the major life activity of working); Howell v. Holland, No. 4:13-CV-00295-RBH, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21124, 2015 WL 751590, at *16 (D.S.C. Feb. 23, 2015) (citing Allen and finding plaintiff was not substantially limited in working because she allegedly could not work with one particular doctor).
Plaintiff's general argument that her ADD "clearly" affected the major life activity of working because her "inability to focus on file documentation lead to her termination" is insufficient. Plaintiff has not [*25]  established an "impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities" or a "record of such an impairment."6 Plaintiff has not established the first prong of her disability-discrimination claim. Because Plaintiff cannot establish this threshold requirement of her prima facie case, further analysis of the disability-discrimination claim is unnecessary.
2. Failure to accommodate
To establish a prima facie failure-to-accommodate claim a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) that she was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the ADA, as amended; (2) that the employer had notice of her disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation she could perform the essential functions of the position; and (4) that the employer refused to make such accommodations. See Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013). The employer and employee must engage in an "interactive process" to identify possible reasonable accommodations. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). The "interactive process" should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that would overcome those limitations. Id.
Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim fails for the reasons discussed above in connection with Plaintiff's [*26]  claim of disability discrimination: she has not established that she was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the ADA, as amended. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate as to this claim. See Lee, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146941, 2020 WL 4726738, at *2 (granting summary judgment as to plaintiff's ADA-based claims of failure to accommodate, disability discrimination, and hostile work environment because plaintiff had been unable to establish that she was a person within the ADA's protected class).
3. Hostile work environment
Defendant also seeks summary judgment as to any ADA-based hostile work environment claim Plaintiff may be bringing. Def. Mem. 24-25. In opposing summary judgment Plaintiff does not pursue a hostile work environment claim based on the ADA. Pl. Mem. 11-14. Rather, she defends such a claim based only on the ADEA. As Plaintiff does not oppose Defendant's arguments, she is not pursuing such a claim and is presumed to have abandoned it. Eady v. Veolia Transp. Servs., Inc., 609 F. Supp. 2d 540, 560-61 (D.S.C. 2009) ("The failure of a party to address an issue raised in summary judgment may be considered a waiver or abandonment of the relevant cause of action."). Summary judgment should be granted as to any ADA-based claim of a hostile work environment.7
B. Plaintiff's ADEA claims [*27] 
Plaintiff's Second Cause of Action is for violation of the ADEA. Her Amended Complaint alleges she was "harassed with heightened scrutiny of her work, discipline, discharge and/or retaliatory discharge as a result of complaining to human resources about the harassment and unequal behavior." Am. Compl. ¶ 34. She submits her alleged mistreatment included "harassment, discipline and termination based on age, as younger employees who were also behind on paperwork or who had performance issues were not subjected to heightened scrutiny, discipline or discharge." Id. ¶ 35.
Defendant seeks summary judgment as to all of Plaintiff's ADEA-related claims, focusing on claims of age-based discrimination and retaliation in its principal brief. Def. Mem. 25-32. In opposing summary judgment, Plaintiff focuses on what she terms a "hostile work environment based on ADEA discrimination and retaliation." Pl. Mem. 10-14. Plaintiff does not plainly delineate the various ADEA claims. On Reply, Defendant reiterates its arguments as to the ADEAbased claims of discrimination and retaliation and argues it is entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claim of a hostile work environment based on age discrimination [*28]  or retaliation. Reply 7-12.
Taken in the light most favorable to her, Plaintiff submits the following evidence in general support of her various ADEA claims:
• Plaintiff focuses on Greene's treatment of Plaintiff and others. Calling Greene her "apparent supervisor," Plaintiff indicates that Greene's job as Habilitation Manager is "directly tied" to Plaintiff's job and notes Greene "belittled" her and other employees by saying she did not wish to "babysit staff," that it was "her way or no way," or she would get a different crew. Pl. Mem. 10-11 (citing Greene Dep. 11, 28-30, ECF No. 49-8; Complaints of Plaintiff, Singletary, and McNeil, ECF No. 49-9).
• Plaintiff notes that Greene was directed to apologize to Plaintiff, Singletary, and McNeil. Handwritten note regarding apologies, ECF No. 49-3. Plaintiff submits that Greene "was not terminated or even disciplined" for these complaints about her behavior. Pl. Mem. 11.
• Plaintiff cites to Greene's deposition as evidence that other employees, such as Asia Belin and Bruce Hugee, had "a lot of deficiencies in their files," but remained employed. Pl. Mem. 11 (citing Greene Dep. 17).
• Plaintiff again notes her July 25, 2018 written complaint [*29]  "regarding being belittled by her younger co-worker Deondray Greene" for statements that included a comment that she had to "babysit staff," pointing out the complaint was made the month before she was terminated. Pl. Mem. 11-12.
1. Hostile work environment
In order to make out a case of hostile work environment under the ADEA, a plaintiff must show (1) that she is at least 40 years old; (2) that she was harassed based on her age; (3) that the harassment had the effect of unreasonably interfering with her work, creating an environment that was both objectively and subjectively hostile or offensive; and (4) that she has some basis for imputing liability to her employer. Burns, 166 F.3d at 294 (citing Crawford v. Medina Gen. Hosp., 96 F.3d 830, 834-35 (6th Cir. 1996)). To satisfy the second element of her claim, Plaintiff must show that "but for" her age she would not have been the victim of the harassment. Dinda v. CSC Gov't Sols., LLC, No. 2:17-CV-03171-DCN-MGB, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121052, 2019 WL 4280370, at *15 (D.S.C. Mar. 21, 2019), report and recommendation adopted, No. 2:17-CV-03171-DCN, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120423, 2019 WL 3244186 (D.S.C. July 19, 2019) (citing Pueschel v. Peters, 577 F.3d 558, 565 (4th Cir. 2009)). Regarding the third element, "Plaintiff must establish that the environment was 'both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one that [Plaintiff] in fact did perceive to be so.'" Dinda v. CSC Gov't Sols., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121052, 2019 WL 4280370, at *15 (quoting  [*30] Fudge v. Sentinel Office Payroll Corp., No. 2:13-CV-01840-CWH, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129605, 2015 WL 5682639, at *9-10 (D.S.C. Sept. 25, 2015) (referencing Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 787, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998)).
Defendant submits that Plaintiff cannot establish a hostile work environment based on age because she has not provided evidence sufficient to support the requisite but-for connection nor can she establish the existence of conduct sufficiently "severe or pervasive" so as to alter the terms or conditions of her employment. Reply 8-9.8 The undersigned agrees.
As an initial matter, Greene's comment about having to "babysit" other employees was not obviously based on age. See Burns, 166 F.3d at 295 (noting mere speculation that comments were based on age was insufficient for hostile work environment claim). More fundamentally, nothing Plaintiff has presented indicates a work environment that was so "objectively and subjectively hostile or offensive" so as to unreasonably interfere with work. In deciding whether the purported harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to bring it within the purview of the ADEA or another statute the undersigned must examine the totality of the circumstances, including "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; [*31]  and whether it unreasonably interferes with [Plaintiff's] work performance." See Fudge, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129605, 2015 WL 5682639, at *10 (referencing Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)); see also Dufau v. Price, 703 F. App'x 164, 166 (4th Cir. 2017). As noted in Dinda, "'incidents that would objectively give rise to bruised or wounded feelings" do not, without more, satisfy the severe and pervasive standard." Dinda, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121052, 2019 WL 4280370, at *16 (quoting EEOC v. Sunbelt Rentals, Inc., 521 F.3d 306, 315 (4th Cir. 2008)).
Here, Plaintiff's only evidence is that Greene spoke to her and others in a "belittling" tone and did not want to "babysit" them. As a matter of law, Greene's behavior, while arguably rude, does not rise to the level of objectively hostile or offensive behavior that alters a term, condition, or privilege of Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff's claim of a hostile work environment is subject to summary judgment.
2. Disparate treatment/discrimination
The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). To establish a prima facie claim of age discrimination under the ADEA, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she is at least 40; (2) she was performing her job to the legitimate expectations of her employer; (3) [*32]  her employer took an adverse employment action against her; and (4) younger similarly situated employees received more favorable treatment. See Dinda, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121052, 2019 WL 4280370, at *14. The last prong may be satisfied by demonstrating Plaintiff was discharged under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. See Brown v. City of Columbia, No. 3:10-CV-2860-JFA, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124969, 2012 WL 3838109, at *2 (D.S.C. Sept. 4, 2012) (citing O'Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, 310-12, 116 S. Ct. 1307, 134 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1996)).9 Plaintiff must prove that age was the "but-for" cause of Defendant's adverse action. Dinda, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121052, 2019 WL 4280370, at *14 (citing Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 176, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009)).
Defendant seeks summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claim of age discrimination, arguing Plaintiff has not presented evidence sufficient to satisfy the second of four prongs of her prima facie case. Def. Mem. 26-29. Even if she could set forth a prima facie case, Defendant argues, Plaintiff cannot show that the reason given for her termination was pretext for unlawful discrimination. Id. at 29-30. The undersigned agrees with Defendant.
Regarding the second prong—that Plaintiff was performing her job to the legitimate expectations of her employer—Defendant has presented evidence that she was not. Some of this evidence is from Plaintiff herself. See, e.g., Nov. 2, 2017 Ham Mem. regarding Plaintiff's deficient paperwork, ECF No. 46-6; Employee Discipline [*33]  Action Report issued by Wilson on November 8, 2017, ECF No. 46-7; Wilson Aff. ¶ 10; Pl. Dep. 52 (acknowledging that a vocational specialist who is not keeping accurate records is not meeting the expectations of that position and has deficient performance); Pl. Dep. 95 (Plaintiff's agreeing she was not meeting expectations as of August 2018 based on substandard documentation). The only evidence to the contrary is Plaintiff's evidence of her 2015 "meeting expectations" evaluation.
Having conceded she was not meeting expectations based on her deficient paperwork and that she was terminated because she was not meeting expectations, she necessarily cannot satisfy the second of the four prongs of the prima facie case of discrimination based on age. Nor can she satisfy the fourth prong of the prima facie case. Liberally construing Plaintiff's argument, she references other employees—Asia Belin and Bruce Hugee—whom she indicates had numerous paperwork deficiencies but were treated differently. Pl. Mem. 11 (citing Greene Dep. 17). However, as noted by Defendant, at 64 years of age, Hugee is older than Plaintiff, thereby negating any indication of retaliation. Further, Plaintiff acknowledged [*34]  she was unaware of the details regarding the paperwork errors made by Hugee or Belin or their correction of their errors. Pl. Dep. 150-54.
Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. Summary judgment is appropriate. Further analysis is not needed.10
3. Retaliation
Plaintiff's ADEA claim also alleges she was "retaliated against because of her complaints." Am. Compl. ¶ 36. In Plaintiff's deposition, Plaintiff identified her age-based retaliation claim as Greene's alleged retaliation against Plaintiff for Plaintiff's statement to Hyman. Plaintiff indicated she felt like Greene "retaliated against [her] and brought up all these accusations because of [Plaintiff's] age. And she wasn't over 20 something." Pl. Dep. 117.
Plaintiff has offered no direct evidence of age-based retaliation; the burden-shifting framework applies. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff must show 1) that she engaged in a protected activity; 2) her employer took an adverse employment action against her; and 3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and adverse action. Causey v. Balog, 162 F.3d 795, 803 (4th Cir. 1998).
Defendant seeks summary judgment, arguing Plaintiff cannot establish her prima facie case as [*35]  she has not proffered evidence that she participated in age-based protected activity, nor can she establish the requisite causation. Def. Mem. 31-32. In this case, to qualify as protected activity, an employee's complaints must communicate "a belief that the employer has engaged in . . . a form of employment discrimination" based on a protected class. Crawford v. Metrop. Gov't of Nashville and Davidson Cnty., 555 U.S. 271, 276, 129 S. Ct. 846, 172 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2009) (in Title VII context); Johnson v. Mechanics & Farmers Bank, 309 F. App'x 675, 685-86 (4th Cir. 2009) (emphasizing, when applying Title VII retaliation analysis to an ADEA claim, that "it is fundamental" that a plaintiff must have engaged "in activities opposing discrimination"). Complaints about management activities that would not constitute unlawful discrimination do not count as protected activity. See Freilich v. Upper Chesapeake Health, Inc., 313 F.3d 205, 216-17 (4th Cir. 2002) (finding no ADA retaliation claim because the plaintiff could not reasonably believe that the conduct she had opposed violated the ADA, even though the opposed conduct could have violated state medical malpractice law); Richardson v. Richland Cnty. Sch. Dist., 52 F. App'x 615, 617 (4th Cir. 2002) ("Richardson has not presented any evidence that she informed Richland County that her complaints were based on race or age discrimination; therefore, Richardson cannot show that she engaged in a protected activity."); Bowman v. Bait. City Bd. of Sch. Commr's, 173 F. Supp. 3d 242, 248 (D. Md. 2016) ("General complaints of unfair treatment are not protected activity."). [*36] 
As an initial matter, the undersigned notes that Plaintiff never addresses Defendant's challenge to her prima facie claim of age-based retaliation.11 In particular, nowhere in Plaintiff's response does she reference the legal argument regarding whether her statement to Hyman concerning Greene could be considered "protected activity" for purposes of her retaliation claim. This failure alone makes summary judgment appropriate. See Eady, 609 F. Supp. 2d at 560-61.
Further, the court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff's July 2018 complaint to Hyman regarding Greene is not protected activity. The statement includes no allegation of age-based discrimination. Rather, it presented generalized complaints regarding Greene's tone, delivery, and belittlement of Plaintiff and other Vocational Specialists. See Pl. Statement, ECF No. 46-10. Summary judgment is appropriate as to Plaintiff's ADEA retaliation claim.12
C. Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim
Plaintiff's Amended Complaint also includes a cause of action for FMLA-based retaliation. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 40-47. Defendant seeks summary judgment as to this claim. Defendant notes that Plaintiff testified in deposition that she bases her FMLA retaliation claim on the fact that when [*37]  she returned from FMLA leave in May 2016, she believed her paperwork had not been maintained well. Def. Mem. 13-14 (citing Pl. Dep. 126, 141-43). Plaintiff testified that her FMLA claim "had finished by May of 2016." Pl. Dep. 143. Plaintiff does not purport to tie her FMLA claim to her 2018 termination.
Defendant seeks dismissal based on the two-year statute of limitations applicable to nonwillful FMLA violations. Def. Mem. 32-33 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1)). Plaintiff returned from her FMLA leave on May 23, 2016. She did not file this action until May 6, 2019. Defendant argues, then, that her FMLA retaliation claim was not filed within the two-year limitations period and should be dismissed as matter of law. Defendant also acknowledges there is a three-year limitations period for willful FMLA violations but submits there is no evidence of a willful violation. Defendant alternatively argues that Plaintiff has not set out a prima facie case of FMLA-based retaliation because she has shown no adverse action tied to her taking FMLA leave, nor has she demonstrated that any adverse action was caused by her taking the leave. Def. Mem. 32-34.
Once again Plaintiff has not addressed this claim in opposing summary [*38]  judgment. Other than list her FMLA claim in reciting her claims in the Introduction and Statement of Facts, Plaintiff never focuses at all on any FMLA-based claim. She does not reference the FMLA in any legal argument (other than in the context of noting she had taken FMLA leave, as had other employees, including Wilson). Defendant has set out several detailed legal arguments as to why it is entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's FMLA-based retaliation claim. Plaintiff has offered no argument to the contrary. The court will not make Plaintiff's arguments for her. See Hensley on behalf of N.C. v. Price, 876 F.3d 573, 581 (4th Cir. 2017) (noting that judges "are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in briefs. Similarly, it is not our job to wade through the record and make arguments for either party."). Plaintiff is deemed to have abandoned her FMLA-based claim of retaliation. See Eady, 609 F. Supp. 2d at 560-61. Summary judgment is appropriate.
IV. Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, the undersigned recommends FCDSNB's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 46, be granted and that this matter be ended.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
