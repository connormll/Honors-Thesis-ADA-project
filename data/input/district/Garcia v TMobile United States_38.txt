Opinion



MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER OF DISMISSAL
On October 14, 2008, Defendant T-Mobile USA, Inc. ("T-Mobile") filed its Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 33, Def.'s Mot. Summ. J.) and its Summary Judgment Memorandum (Doc. No. 34, Def.'s Summ. J. Mem.). T-Mobile asks for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff Kristal Garcia's claims. It is the Court's understanding that Garcia has brought two claims under the New Mexico Human Rights Act ("NMHRA"): 1) failure by T-Mobile to accommodate her serious medical condition, and 2) retaliation by T-Mobile for her filing of a complaint with the New Mexico Human Rights Division ("NMHRD").1 The Court finds that there are no genuine disputes of material fact and that T-Mobile is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on both claims. Therefore, the motion should be granted.

Standard for Summary Judgment
Summary [*2]  judgment is appropriate if "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). When applying this standard, the Court examines "the factual record and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment." MacKenzie v. City and County of Denver, 414 F.3d 1266, 1273 (10th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). "Summary judgment is appropriate if the non-moving party cannot adduce probative evidence on an element of its claim upon which it bears the burden of proof." Id. (citation omitted). "A disputed fact is 'material' if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and the dispute is 'genuine' if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. (citation omitted). "Unsupported conclusory allegations, however, do not create an issue of fact," id. (citation omitted); neither does "evidence, including testimony, ... based on ... mere speculation, conjecture, or surmise." Bones v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 366 F.3d 869, 875 (10th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). However, "it is not [the Court's] province at the summary judgment stage to weigh evidence or make credibility determinations." Sanders v. Sw. Bell Tel., L.P., 544 F.3d 1101, 1105-06 (10th Cir. 2008).

Background
Except where otherwise noted, the following material facts are [*3]  not disputed. On April 16, 2001, Kristal Garcia, then named Kristal Gordon, accepted an offer to work for T-Mobile, then named VoiceStream Wireless Corporation ("VoiceStream"). (See Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. Exs. A, C ¶ 2.) She worked at VoiceStream until January 15, 2002, when she was fired for attendance problems.2 (Id. Ex. B.)
On July 24, 2006, Garcia filled out an online application to work for T-Mobile. (Id. Ex. D.) On the application, she stated that she worked for Cigna Healthcare from July, 1995 to May, 2003; thus, the application did not reflect her work at VoiceStream. In addition, the form specifically asked if the applicant had ever applied to "T-Mobile USA, VoiceStream, OmniPoint, Aerial, or Powertel under the name on this application or under any other name," to which Garcia answered "No."3 Similarly, the form asked if the applicant had ever been employed by any of those companies, to which she again answered "No."4 Finally, the form stated, "[I]f employed, false information or significant omissions on this application shall be grounds for immediate termination of employment." At her subsequent interview, Garcia told the interviewer about her previous employment with VoiceStream [*4]  and offered to provide an updated version of her resume. (Pl.'s Dep. 32:23-33:3.) The interviewer told her that was not necessary and that he would make a note of her previous employment.5
On August 10, 2006, T-Mobile offered Garcia a job as a "Customer Care Representative" ("CCR") at a call center in Albuquerque.6 (Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. Ex. F.) She accepted and her employment started on August 14, 2006. T-Mobile classified Garcia as a "New Hire." (Id. Ex. G.) Garcia's work as a CCR consisted of "answering calls from T-Mobile's clients." (Pl.'s Dep. 41:8-13.) CCRs, including Garcia, were given scheduled lunch times, scheduled breaks, and an 18 minute buffer each day for unscheduled breaks. (Chapin Dep. 13:22-14:2; Johnson Dep. 10:6-23.)
Garcia has a condition known as "irritable bowel syndrome" ("IBS") which requires her to use the restroom frequently for periods of five to thirty minutes. (Pl.'s Dep. 49:1-3.) However, there is no medical documentation in the record that she has been diagnosed with IBS.7 A few times Garcia spoke to her supervisor, Holly Chapin, about "needing to use the restroom and having pains." (Id. 52:3-19.) There is no evidence that Garcia told Chapin she had IBS, [*5]  but Garcia did tell Chapin that her "abdominal pains" made it difficult for her to wait for scheduled breaks and to start work on time. (Id. 53:10-19.) Chapin told Garcia she would have to bring in a note from a doctor in order to be allowed to take restroom breaks outside of her schedule. (Id. 53:3-9) In the interim, Chapin and her assistant, Joe Youmans, told Garcia she would have to "limit her logging out outside of lunch and breaks and ... try to start ... holding it until [her] breaks or lunches." (Id. 54:6-11.)
On December 1, 2006, Garcia showed a note from a doctor to Chapin. (Id. 55:22-56:1.) The note stated in full, "May need to use restroom spontaneously due to abdominal pain and migraine HA." (Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. Ex. J.) Chapin told Garcia to contact Human Resources. (Pl.'s Dep. 55:22-56:1.) "On or about December 11," Garcia showed the note to an employee in Human Resources, Larissa Johnson. (Id. 57:4-18; Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. 4 ¶ 14) Johnson told Garcia that, in order to accommodate her, she would need to have her doctor fill out T-Mobile's form. (Pl.s' Dep. 57:18-25; Johnson Dep. 9:11-22.) Johnson asked Garcia to return the form within 15 days and in the interim to use [*6]  her 18 minute buffer for her bathroom breaks. (Id. 9:23-25.)
Garcia believed the form asked for "a lot of personal information that was not, by law, to be disclosed," such as HIV/AIDS testing. (Pl.'s Dep. 60:11-24.) Garcia did not discuss her concerns about the form with T-Mobile. (Id. 106:20-23.)8 She intended to take it to a doctor but never did. (Id. 66:1-9.) In the mean time, on December 26, Garcia asked Youmans for permission to take a break outside of her schedule and was told that "she needed to hold it" until a scheduled break. (Id. 67:2-12.) Garcia tried to but was unsuccessful and "didn't make it" to the restroom in time. (Id.) On other, daily occasions her requests for breaks were denied. (Id. at 70:4-23.)
On December 28, Johnson sent an email to Garcia with an attached letter requesting she return the completed form by December 30. (Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. 5 ¶ 19, Ex. L.) The next day, December 29, Garcia responded by email that her doctor was out of town; she also told Johnson about her accident on December 26. (Id. Ex. M-1.) Johnson told Garcia that "the accommodation process is a two-way street" and that T-Mobile could not accommodate Garcia until she provided a "doctor's [*7]  certification that she [had] something requiring accommodation." (Id. Ex. M-2.) Until then, Garcia was "accountable" for unscheduled breaks (id.), which did not necessarily imply "disciplinary action or termination" (Johnson Dep. 18:15-25). Later on December 29, a person who Johnson was told was from the "Department of Labor" came to the T-Mobile office. (Id. at 36:20-23.) Johnson referred the person to Susan Kramer, a human resources manager, who later informed Johnson that the person was in fact Garcia's husband. (Id. 36:24-37:6.) Garcia had spoken earlier on December 29 with her husband about the possibility that T-Mobile might deny her accommodation. (Pl.'s Dep. 76:8-24.)
Still later on December 29, Kramer decided to grant Garcia conditional accommodation pending Garcia's completion of the requested paperwork. (Johnson Dep. 12:18-13:2.) Johnson then sent an email to Chapin telling her to give Garcia "additional bathroom breaks as necessary" and to clear any unscheduled breaks Garcia may have taken since December 5, thus no longer holding her accountable for them. (Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. Ex. N.) From that point on, Garcia was allowed to take breaks as needed and could email the appropriate [*8]  department so that the breaks would not be held against her. (Pl.'s Dep. 127:24-128:3; Johnson Dep. 22:2-20.)
On January 4 or 5, 2007, Garcia filed a complaint with the NMHRD. (Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. Ex. O.) The complaint alleged that Garcia had a serious medical condition and that on December 12 her supervisor told Garcia she could not log out and use the restroom. The complaint alleged that as a result T-Mobile had discriminated against Garcia in violation of the NMHRA. The complaint stated that discriminatory actions had only taken place on December 12; the box marked "Continuing Action" was not checked.
In the mean time, Johnson looked at Garcia's record to see if she might be qualified for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. (Johnson Dep. 25:12-26:9.) In doing so, Johnson discovered that Garcia had been fired by VoiceStream. (Id. 26:10-18.) As a result, on January 5, 2007, Johnson, Craig Alter (a newly hired human resources manager), and Chapin's supervisor met with Garcia and asked her about her previous employment. (Alter Aff. ¶ 6; Pl.'s Dep. 100:17-25.) It is disputed whether Garcia denied being employed by VoiceStream or instead admitted it but explained that she had [*9]  told the interviewer about it. (Johnson Dep. 27:12-25; Alter Aff. ¶ 6; Pl.'s Dep. 101:1-10.) Garcia did not mention at the January 5 meeting that she had filed a complaint with the NMHRD the day before or earlier on the day of the meeting and did not tell anyone at T-Mobile at any other time about the complaint. (Id. 101:11-17.) Either at the January 5 meeting or at a January 12 meeting with Alter (or both) she was told she would be fired because of her omission on her application. (Pl's. Dep. 100:23; Alter Aff. ¶ 9.) January 12 was Garcia's final day of employment with T-Mobile. (See id.)
That same day, January 12, NMHRD sent to T-Mobile written notice of the complaint Garcia had filed. (Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. Ex. Q-1.) Alter received the notice approximately five days later; it was the first he learned of that complaint. (Alter Aff. ¶ 10.) On January 22, Garcia filed another complaint with NMHRD, alleging that she was fired for what she believed was retaliation for filing the initial complaint. (Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. Ex. R.)
On January 12, 2008, after exhausting her remedies with the NMHRD, Garcia filed her Complaint for Civil Rights Violation and Notice of Appeal in New Mexico state [*10]  district court. (Compl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff Garcia brought claims under the New Mexico Human Rights Act ("NMHRA"), N.M. Stat. §§ 28-1-1 to - 15 (2004 & Supp. 2007). T-Mobile removed the case to this Court, citing diversity jurisdiction and producing an affidavit stating that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000. (Doc. No. 1.) T-Mobile now moves for summary judgment on Garcia's claims.

Analysis
The Court is faced with an initial problem: T-Mobile makes its motion for summary judgment on "all of Plaintiff's claims," (Def.'s M. Summ. J.), but Garcia's complaint does not clearly enumerate her claims (See Compl.). The complaint alleges that Garcia asked for reasonable accommodation of a medical condition through regularly scheduled and emergency bathroom breaks and was refused, resulting in an incident in which she soiled her garments. (Id. ¶¶ 9-12.) The complaint also alleges that T-Mobile fired Garcia in retaliation for her complaint to NMHRD about T-Mobile's refusal to accommodate her. (Id. ¶ 13.) The complaint makes other, less specific allegations as well. First, it alleges that Defendant "failed to comply with its own internal policies in failing to grant equal opportunity employment to Plaintiff." ( [*11] Id. ¶ 16.) Second, it alleges that "Defendant has engaged in a pattern of discrimination and retaliation against the Plaintiff as a result of Plaintiff's medical condition." (Id. ¶ 17.) Finally, it generally alleges that "Defendant has failed to comply with the [NMHRA], prohibiting discrimination and retaliation against individuals because of their medical condition." (Id. ¶ 14.)
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that a pleading contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."9 Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). "[T]o withstand a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain enough allegations of fact to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). "[C]omplaints that are no more than 'labels and conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action'" are insufficient. Id. (quoting Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1964-65). "Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Id. (quoting Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965).
Under this standard, Garcia's complaint states two claims under the NMHRA. The general allegation that T-Mobile has failed to comply with the NMHRA does not (by itself) state a claim, because it does not contain sufficient allegations [*12]  of fact. The allegation that T-Mobile has engaged in a pattern of discrimination and retaliation does not (by itself) state a claim, because it does not allege any facts in addition to those stated elsewhere. Finally, the allegation that T-Mobile failed to comply with its own internal policies does not state a claim because it does not show Garcia is entitled to relief under the NMHRA. See N.M. Stat. § 28-1-7 (2004 & Supp. 2007) (no independent cause of action for failure to follow internal policies). Two claims are stated that are supported by sufficient allegations of fact: 1) T-Mobile failed to accommodate Garcia's serious medical condition, IBS, and 2) T-Mobile retaliated against Garcia for filing a complaint with the NMHRD regarding the failure to accommodate.
Subsequent filings in this case support this conclusion. In its memorandum, T-Mobile characterizes the complaint as bringing these two claims. (Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. 9.) Garcia does not dispute this characterization in her response. (See Pl.'s Resp.) Furthermore, T-Mobile attaches copies of the two administrative complaints made by Garcia to the NMHRD. (Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. Exs. O, R.) These copies indicate that Garcia charged T-Mobile on January [*13]  5, 2007, with discrimination in violation of the NMHRA by not allowing her to use the bathroom (Id. Ex. O) and again on January 12, 2007, with retaliation in violation of the NMHRA for her administrative complaint of January 5 (Id. Ex. R). Since the record shows no other administrative complaints, these two complaints are the only ones exhausted and properly before the Court. Therefore, the Court understands Garcia's complaint to bring only two claims: 1) failure to accommodate a serious medical condition; and 2) firing in retaliation for filing a charge with NMHRD.

Claim of Failure to Accommodate
The NMHRA makes it "an unlawful discriminatory practice for ... any employer to refuse or fail to accommodate a person's ... serious medical condition, unless such accommodation is unreasonable or an undue hardship." N.M. Stat. § 28-1-7(J) (2004 & Supp. 2007). In interpreting the NMHRA, New Mexico courts "rely upon federal adjudication" of the "closest federal counterpart" to the NMHRA but are not bound by it. Trujillo v. N. Rio Arriba Elec. Co-op, Inc., 2002- NMSC 004, 131 N.M. 607, 41 P.3d 333, 338 (N.M. 2001) (citing Smith v. FDC Corp., 1990- NMSC 020, 109 N.M. 514, 787 P.2d 433, 436 (N.M. 1990)). Instead, the language of the NMHRA and the intent of the New Mexico legislature control. Id. The "closest federal counterpart" to the provision of the NMHRA at issue here may be found in the Americans [*14]  with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (2006), which requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities unless such accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer. Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Trujillo, 41 P.3d at 339-40 (ADA closest counterpart to NMHRA accommodation provision).
There are a number of distinctions between the relevant provisions of the ADA and the NMHRA. First, the ADA's accommodation provision applies only to "otherwise qualified individual[s] with a disability," which the ADA defines as "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) (2006). The NMHRA lacks a corresponding limit on its applicability. Furthermore, the ADA defines "reasonable accommodation" as a non-exhaustive list of specific acts, including in particular "part-time or modified work schedules," and does not consider hardship to the employer in the definition; instead, undue hardship is defined separately. Id. § 12111(9), (10). The NMHRA does not define "reasonable accommodation," although NMHRD regulations do: "[S]uch modifications or adaptations of the work environment or job responsibilities [*15]  of a handicapped person as are necessary to enable him or her to perform the essential functions of the job in question and which do not impose an undue hardship on the employer." N.M. Admin. Code § 9.1.1.7(DD). Finally, the ADA defines "disability," 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) (2006), while the NMHRA does not define "serious medical condition." Again, NMHRD regulations provide a definition: "[A] serious health-related impairment other than a handicap, which substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities ... and which is verifiable by medical diagnosis." N.M. Admin. Code § 9.1.1.7(GG).10 Furthermore, the term is "intended to apply to a serious health-related impairment that requires protection against discrimination due to the severity and/or duration of the impairment." Id. § 9.1.1.7(GG)(4). In Trujillo the New Mexico Supreme Court stated that the terms "medical condition" in the NMHRA11 and "disability" could be used interchangeably, at least in the case before them, and as a result held that a "medical condition" must be more than a "temporary illness[] with minimal residual effects." Trujillo, 41 P.3d at 339.
Following the Trujillo court's instruction to look to federal law for guidance, the Court turns to the details of an ADA claim. [*16]  At the summary judgment stage, a plaintiff bringing a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA must make a prima facie case by showing that 1) she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; 2) she is a "qualified individual with a disability" as defined by the ADA; and 3) the defendant failed to make a reasonable accommodation as defined by the ADA. See Bartee v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., 374 F.3d 906, 912 n.4 (10th Cir. 2004) (specifically using reassignment, one type of "reasonable accommodation" as defined by the ADA, in third element). The plaintiff need only show that the accommodation is reasonable on its face, that is, "ordinarily or in the run of cases." U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-02 (2002), 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589. The burden then shifts to the defendant to show that special, case-specific circumstances would cause it to suffer an undue hardship. Id. at 402. Keeping in mind the differences between the NMHRA and the ADA, the Court finds that a plaintiff bringing a failure to accommodate claim under the NMHRA must make a prima facie case by showing, at a minimum,12 1) she has a "physical or mental handicap or serious medical condition;" and 2) the defendant failed to make a reasonable accommodation by "modifying or adapting the work environment as necessary to allow her to perform the essential functions of her job." [*17]  If the plaintiff makes her prima facie case, the defendant must then, as with the ADA, show undue hardship.
Here, Garcia claims that she has a serious medical condition, IBS, and that T-Mobile failed to accommodate her by modifying her work schedule. T-Mobile does not claim undue hardship; instead, it disputes both elements of Garcia's prima facie case.13 First, T-Mobile notes that the NMHRD regulations that define "serious medical condition" require that it be "verifiable by medical diagnosis." N.M. Admin. Code § 9.1.1.7(GG). As a result, T-Mobile essentially argues the sufficiency of Garcia's evidence that she has IBS, in that she has not produced a medical diagnosis to that effect. (See Def.'s Summ. J. Mem. 10.)
As an initial matter, the Court notes this argument raises a small issue of New Mexico administrative law. Typically, judicial review of orders of New Mexico agencies is similar to federal administrative law: a court "review[s] the entire record of the administrative hearing to determine whether the [] decision was arbitrary and capricious, not supported by substantial evidence, or otherwise not in accordance with law." Smyers v. City of Albuquerque, 2006- NMCA 095, 140 N.M. 198, 141 P.3d 542, 545 (N.M. Ct. App. 2006) (citation omitted). However, the NMHRA provides for a "trial de novo" in [*18]  state district court for "any person aggrieved by an order of the commission." N.M. Stat. § 28-1-13(A) (2004 & Supp. 2007).14 This means that "the legislature intended to grant the aggrieved party a full evidentiary hearing, not limited to or constrained by the transcript of the commission hearing." Green v. Kase, 1992- NMSC 004, 113 N.M. 76, 823 P.2d 318, 320 (N.M. 1992) (emphasis added). Given the Green court's description of a "trial de novo," this Court concludes that substantive regulations of the NMHRD are binding law during such a trial, just as they would be in normal "substantial evidence" review of an administrative order.
Turning to the regulation, N.M. Admin. Code § 9.1.1.7(GG), the Court notes that it can be read in two ways. First, there is the reading that T-Mobile suggests: a serious medical condition is one that (in addition to the other requirements) has been verified by medical diagnosis. Second, there is the reading that conforms to the regulation's text: a serious medical condition is one that is verifiable by medical diagnosis. The first reading would make a diagnosis by a physician a substantive part of the definition. The second reading would instead eliminate classes of claims for conditions that have not been recognized by medical science or are otherwise not verifiable. This second [*19]  reading is supported by another regulation, which states, "Evidence documenting a serious medical condition may be provided by the written certification of a physician or other appropriate medical authority, or by the written verification of a witness with direct observation of a clearly visible health-related impairment." N.M. Admin. Code § 9.1.1.8(G)(3) (emphasis added). The Court adopts the second, more natural reading of the regulation and concludes that N.M. Admin. Code § 9.1.1.7(GG) does not require Garcia to produce a medical diagnosis that she has IBS.
In arguing that Garcia must provide a medical diagnosis in order to make her prima facie case, T-Mobile quotes the following language from Trujillo: "[A]n employer cannot be held to have imputed knowledge of an illness ... [w]here the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer." Trujillo, 41 P.3d at 340 (citation omitted). Taken in context, this language is relevant not to Garcia's burden of proof before this Court, but to what notice of her condition she was required to give to T-Mobile. T-Mobile argues that her doctor's note was insufficient in this respect, and so the Court turns to that argument.
In Trujillo, the defendant raised [*20]  a similar argument. Id. at 339-40. In response, the plaintiff argued that accommodation required an "interactive process" between an employer and an employee and that his employer had refused to do so in bad faith. Id. at 340. The New Mexico Supreme Court agreed that an interactive process was required, but found that this imposed duties on an employee as well: "In general, the interactive process must ordinarily begin with the employee providing notice to the employer of the employee's disability and any resulting limitations, and expressing a desire for reassignment if no reasonable accommodation is possible in the employee's existing job." Id. (quoting Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1171-72 (10th Cir. 1999)).15 "Where the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer, ... the initial burden rests primarily upon the employee, or his health-care provider, to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations." Id. (quoting Taylor v. Principal Fin. Group, Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996)).
It is useful to describe in detail the interaction between the parties in Trujillo. It started when the plaintiff told his employer that he was feeling symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness. [*21]  Id. at 336. The employer "placed him on sick leave to recuperate." Id. During his leave, the plaintiff saw a doctor, who developed a "working hypothesis" that the employee had suffered a "transient ischemic attack." Id. at 337. Because such an attack may warn of a future stroke, the doctor referred the plaintiff to specialists for a number of diagnostic tests, all of which came back negative. Id. As a result, the doctor gave the plaintiff a "work release" clearing him to return to work on a part-time basis. Id. A general manager for the employer attempted to get more information from the doctor about the release but received no response. Id. Instead of allowing the plaintiff to work part-time, the manager placed him on administrative leave. Id. At trial, the jury found for the plaintiff on his claim that the employer's disallowing of part-time work violated the NMHRA as a failure to accommodate. Id. On review by the New Mexico Supreme Court (under essentially the same standard as applies here) the Court found that there was no failure to accommodate, because the certificate of work release provided by the doctor was insufficient notice under the standards discussed above. Id. at 340.
The facts here match squarely [*22]  with those in Trujillo. T-Mobile was told by Garcia and in the doctor's note about symptoms—abdominal pain and headaches—but was not provided with a diagnosis of IBS, just as the employer in Trujillo was told about symptoms—fatigue and dizziness—but not given a diagnosis. Similarly, the notes from the doctor in both cases only provided a brief description of a suggested accommodation—part-time work or need to use the restroom spontaneously—without information about the underlying reasons for the accommodation. In both cases, the employer tried to get more information about the employee's condition but was unsuccessful. As a result, the employer was unable to determine if the employee had a long-term condition that would require accommodation or a transient condition that could be taken care of through sick leave. Therefore, the Court finds that, like the plaintiff in Trujillo, Garcia gave T-Mobile insufficient notice of a request for accommodation. Although Garcia went so far as to meet with Johnson, which (in a light most favorable to Garcia) could be inferred as a generalized request for accommodation, notice is insufficient without some description of the "serious medical condition" [*23]  underlying the request, cf. Midland Brake, 180 F.3d at 1171 (under ADA, employee must provide notice of the disability as well as its limitations), and Garcia never told T-Mobile she suffered from IBS.
Despite this, Garcia argues that the description in the doctor's note of abdominal pain, headaches, and spontaneous need to use the restroom suffices as notice of a serious medical condition. However, T-Mobile argues, and Garcia admits, that these symptoms are consistent with transient conditions that do not qualify as a serious medical condition. Garcia also argues that the note as well as Garcia's discussion of her symptoms with T-Mobile made the condition "open, obvious, and apparent." When this language from Trujillo is read in context, though, it is clear that what is meant is that the condition itself is "open, obvious, and apparent," not the employee's requests. Therefore, the Court finds that Garcia failed to provide sufficient notice to T-Mobile of her request for accommodation.
In addition, Garcia failed to engage in the process by not returning the form requested by T-Mobile or explaining her reasons to them. Interactivity means more than just initiation: it means responding as well. See Midland Brake, 180 F.3d at 1171 ("[T]he interactive [*24]  process must ordinarily begin with the employee providing notice.") (emphasis added). "The interactive process includes good-faith communications between the employer and employee." Id. at 1172. "A party that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith. A party that fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may also be acting in bad faith." Id. (quoting Beck v. Univ. of Wisc. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996)). "Neither party should be able to cause a breakdown in the process for the purpose of either avoiding or inflicting liability." Id. (quoting Baert v. Euclid Beverage, Ltd., 149 F.3d 626, 634 (7th Cir. 1998)). The process allows the parties to "identify the employee's precise limitations and discuss accommodations which might enable the employee to continue working." Id. at 1172 n.10 (quoting Hendricks-Robinson v. Excel Corp., 154 F.3d 685, 693 (7th Cir. 1998)). This process may include fulfilling an employer's reasonable request for additional medical certification. Templeton v. Neodata Services, Inc., 162 F.3d 617, 618-19 (10th Cir. 1998). By failing to complete the form, Garcia prevented the parties from identifying her precise limitations. A note saying that she might spontaneously need restroom breaks is insufficient to fully develop an accommodation; more information, such as frequency and duration, or a precise diagnosis from which those two could be inferred, would be required. Furthermore, T-Mobile communicated with [*25]  Garcia in good faith: Johnson explained to Garcia that T-Mobile could not accommodate her until she carried out her end of the process. Garcia, on the other hand, never explained her objections to the form to Johnson. Therefore, the Court finds that Garcia failed to engage in the interactive process first by providing insufficient notice of her serious medical condition to T-Mobile and second by not responding to T-Mobile's requests that she complete its form. As a result, T-Mobile should be granted summary judgment on Garcia's claim under the NMHRA for failure to accommodate a serious medical condition.

Claim of Retaliation
The NMHRA makes it "an unlawful discriminatory practice for ... any person or employer to ... engage in any form of ... reprisal [] against any person who ... has filed a complaint ... under the [NMHRA]." N.M. Stat. § 28-1-7(I)(2) (2004 & Supp. 2007). In interpreting this provision, as with the accommodation provision, New Mexico courts rely for guidance on the decisions of federal courts regarding retaliation claims brought under federal statutes. Gonzales v. N.M. Dept. of Health, 2000- NMSC 029, 129 N.M. 586, 11 P.3d 550, 557 (N.M. 2000) As a result, such claims are analyzed by using a modified form of McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting. Id. at 558 (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Jeffries v. Kansas, 147 F.3d 1220, 1231 (10th Cir. 1998)). "To establish a prima facie [*26]  case of retaliation, [a] [p]laintiff must show that: (1) [s]he engaged in protected activity, (2) [s]he was subject to adverse employment action subsequent to, or contemporaneous with the protected activity, and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Juneau v. Intel Corp., 2006- NMSC 002, 139 N.M. 12, 127 P.3d 548, 552 (N.M. 2005) (citing Gonzales, 11 P.3d at 558). "[T]he burden [then shifts] to the employer to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." Id. at 551 (citations omitted). Once the employer offers such a reason, the "employee then has the opportunity to rebut the employer's proffered reason as pretextual or otherwise inadequate." Id. at 551-52. (citation omitted). In addition, the employee has, at all times, the ultimate burden of showing that the adverse action was retaliation for the protected activity. Gonzales, 11 P.3d at 557.
There is no dispute that Garcia's firing was an adverse action. However, T-Mobile disputes that Garcia engaged in a protected activity. Under the NMHRA, filing a complaint with the NMHRD is, in general, a protected activity. N.M. Stat. § 28-1-7(I)(2) (2004 & Supp. 2007). T-Mobile argues that Garcia's first complaint was filed despite T-Mobile's efforts to accommodate her and was therefore made in bad faith. As a result, [*27]  it should not be considered protected activity. New Mexico courts do not seem to have decided whether a bad faith or unreasonable NMHRA filing is protected. See Juneau, 127 P.3d at 552 (issue not preserved for appeal). Therefore, the Court looks to federal law for guidance. In the Tenth Circuit, even a good faith but objectively unreasonable Title VII complaint is not protected activity. Crumpacker v. Kan. Dept. of Human Resources, 338 F.3d 1163, 1171 (10th Cir. 2003) (inferring this rule from Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 269, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001)). As explained above, accommodation of a serious medical condition is an interactive process. Garcia may have had a good faith belief that the form asked for unnecessary medical information, but it was objectively reasonable for T-Mobile to request that she complete the form before granting a permanent accommodation. In addition, T-Mobile accommodated Garcia on a temporary basis, giving her an opportunity to complete the interactive process. Therefore, the Court finds that Garcia's initial complaint to the NMHRD, even if in good faith, was unreasonable and not protected activity.
T-Mobile also argues that there was no causal connection between Garcia's filing of the complaint and the firing. Garcia responds that because she was fired just one week after she filed her first complaint with the NMHRD, [*28]  this is sufficient to make her prima facie case. (Pl.'s Resp. 14 (citing Rodriguez v. AOL, 183 F. Supp. 2d 1340 (D.N.M. 2001)).) In the Tenth Circuit, when "termination is very closely connected in time to the protected activity," causation may be inferred. Anderson v. Coors Brewing Co., 181 F.3d 1171, 1179 (10th Cir. 1999) (citation omitted). New Mexico courts, however, have not decided whether close temporal proximity, by itself, suffices for a plaintiff's prima facie case under the NMHRA for retaliation. Juneau, 127 P.3d at 554. Sidestepping the temporal proximity issue, T-Mobile points out that an employer must have knowledge of the complaint in order for retaliation to exist. Montes v. Vail Clinic, Inc., 497 F.3d 1160, 1176 (10th Cir. 2007) (plaintiff must show knowledge on part of decision maker as part of prima facie case for retaliation) (citation omitted); cf. Hedberg, 47 F.3d at 932-34 (employer must have knowledge of disability, not just its symptoms, in order to have discriminated "because of" it). While New Mexico courts have not discussed whether, under the NMHRA, knowledge is required for a plaintiff's prima facie case, the Court assumes, at least, that an employer may rebut a prima facie case under the NMHRA by showing lack of knowledge.
T-Mobile notes three facts that it argues show its lack of knowledge that Garcia had filed a complaint with NMHRD. Garcia was fired on January 12, 2007, the same [*29]  day that NMHRD sent notice of the complaint to T-Mobile, which did not receive the notice until five days later. In addition, there is no admissible evidence in the record that Garcia informed T-Mobile of her complaint. Finally, Alter, the decision maker in Garcia's firing, denies in his affidavit any knowledge of the complaint.
In response, Garcia argues that T-Mobile did have knowledge of her complaint. She points to her husband's visit, where Johnson mistakenly believed Garcia's husband was a Department of Labor employee who was inquiring about Garcia. This, Garcia argues, shows T-Mobile had knowledge of at least a "potential NMHRD claim." (Pl.'s Resp. 14.) Garcia's argument fails for three reasons. First, as T-Mobile points out, Garcia failed to plead retaliation based on a potential claim. (See Compl. ¶ 13.) Second, the NMHRA, on its face, does not protect against retaliation for potential claims or other actions that might initiate an investigation by the NMHRD. See N.M. Stat. § 28-1-7(I)(2) (2004 & Supp. 2007). Although, (for example) Title VII's protection for "participation in a proceeding" is broad, Vaughn v. Epworth Villa, 537 F.3d 1147, 1152 (10th Cir. 2008), the language of that statute is correspondingly broader than that of the NMHRA. Compare [*30]  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) (2006) ("made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing") (emphasis added) with N.M. Stat. § 28-1-7(I)(2) (2004 & Supp. 2007) ("filed a complaint, testified or participated in any proceeding").16 Third, by imputing Johnson's knowledge to T-Mobile, Garcia glosses over a necessary level of speculation: that Johnson told Alter about her knowledge. Cf. Hedberg, 47 F.3d at 931-32 (imputing knowledge of manager to decision maker was speculation and therefore insufficient to defeat summary judgment). Such speculation is improper at the summary judgment stage. Garcia has had an opportunity to depose Johnson, Alter, and others who might have been able to cast light on Alter's knowledge, but Garcia does not produce any evidence that Alter had such knowledge. Therefore, the Court finds that Garcia has also failed to show the third element of her prima facie case, a causal connection between her complaint filed with the NMHRD in early January 2007 and her firing on January 12, 2007.
T-Mobile also provides a legitimate reason for firing Garcia: her omission of her previous employment with VoiceStream in her application. See Marx v. Schnuck Markets, Inc., 76 F.3d 324, 327 (10th Cir. 1996) (misrepresentation on employment application is legitimate, non-discriminatory [*31]  reason for firing at-will employee). In addition, T-Mobile points out that this omission was significant because Garcia was fired by VoiceStream for attendance problems. Under Tenth Circuit law, at the summary judgment stage a plaintiff must show pretext by "producing evidence of such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons." Jaramillo v. Colo. Judicial Dept., 427 F.3d 1303, 1308 (10th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). The Court must "look at the facts as they appear to the person making the decision to terminate, not the aggrieved employee." Piercy v. Maketa, 480 F.3d 1192, 1200 (10th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). New Mexico courts, though, seem to require slightly less from the plaintiff in rebutting pretext. "[W]hether a proffered justification is legitimate, or is merely an excuse to cover up illegal conduct, is largely a credibility issue and often requires the use of circumstantial evidence" and is therefore usually best left to the jury. Juneau, 127 P.3d at 555. "Evidence of falsity" of the reason suffices to survive summary judgment, Garcia-Montoya v. State Treasurer's Office, 2001- NMSC 003, 130 N.M. 25, 16 P.3d 1084, 1101 (N.M. 2001), as does evidence of causation [*32]  other than temporal proximity, see Juneau, 127 P.3d at 555; cf. Anderson, 181 F.3d at 1180. The plaintiff's burden, generally speaking, is to provide sufficient evidence that a reasonable jury could conclude that the given reason was pretextual. See Juneau, 127 P.3d at 555.
Here, Garcia has failed to show additional evidence of causation. Instead, she attempts to show that T-Mobile's reason for firing her is false. Garcia argues that she told the interviewer about her previous employment with VoiceStream. This argument fails for a similar reason as her causality argument: it speculatively imputes the knowledge of the interviewer to Alter, the decision maker. Without that speculation, Garcia does not show that the reason for her firing is false, just that the underlying fact the reason was based on was mistaken. See E.E.O.C. v. Flasher Co., 986 F.2d 1312, 1322 n.12 (10th Cir. 1992) ("[A] mistaken belief can be a legitimate reason for an employment decision and is not necessarily pretextual.") (citation omitted). Even granting Garcia a disputed fact—that she told Alter and Johnson that she had told the interviewer about her work for VoiceStream—does not save her claim. Alter is not held to the same standard in his employment decision as this Court is in its summary judgment decision: he could reasonably rely on Garcia's [*33]  written application rather than Garcia's word. In addition, as T-Mobile points out, Garcia was fired at least in part because she was involuntary terminated by VoiceStream for attendance problems.
Garcia also argues that, as shown by Johnson's later discovery, T-Mobile had the capability through its database system to determine that Garcia had previously worked for VoiceStream. This argument essentially attempts to hold T-Mobile to a negligence standard-"should have known"-in its proffered reason. There does not seem to be any basis in the law for doing so. See Piercy, 480 F.3d at 1200 ("The relevant inquiry is not whether [the] proffered reasons were wise, fair or correct, but rather ... whether [the decisionmaker] believed those reasons to be true and acted in good faith upon those beliefs.") (citation omitted). Garcia has failed to produce evidence such that a reasonable jury could conclude that T-Mobile's reason was pretextual.
In summary, the Court finds that Garcia has failed to establish two elements of her prima facie case for retaliation in violation of the NMHRA. First, she has not shown that she engaged in a protected activity, because her initial complaint to the NMHRD was unreasonable. Second, [*34]  she has failed to establish a causal connection between her complaint and the firing. In addition, Garcia has failed to show that T-Mobile's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for firing her was pretextual. Therefore, T-Mobile should be granted its motion for summary judgment on Garcia's complaint of retaliation.
IT IS ORDERED THAT
Defendant T-Mobile USA, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 33) is GRANTED and Plaintiff Kristal Garcia's claims are dismissed with prejudice.
