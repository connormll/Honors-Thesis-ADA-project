MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
NAOMI REICE BUCHWALD
UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
Plaintiff Laverne Seabrook ("Seabrook") commenced this action against her former employer, New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation ("HHC"), alleging employment discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. ("ADA"), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. ("ADEA"), the New York State Human Rights Law, N. Y. Executive Law §§ 290 et seq. ("NYSHRL"), and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. ("NYCHRL"). Presently before the Court is HHC's motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons set forth herein, this motion is granted.

BACKGROUND1

I. Seabrook's Rule 56.1 Response
Local Civil Rule 56.1 calls for a summary judgment movant to submit "a separate, short and concise statement, in numbered paragraphs, of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried," and for the opposing party to submit "a correspondingly numbered paragraph responding to each numbered paragraph in the statement of the moving party, and if necessary, additional paragraphs containing a separate, short and concise statement of additional material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried." If the opposing party then fails to controvert a fact [*3]  set forth in the movant's Rule 56.1 statement, that fact will be deemed admitted pursuant to the local rule. Local R. 56.1(c); see also Giannullo v. City of New York, 322 F.3d 139, 140 (2d Cir. 2003).
Seabrook's Rule 56.1 Response fails to grasp the function, if not the form, of this rule. Rather than a presentation of disputed facts, Seabrook's response is essentially an enumerated litany of legal and evidentiary objections, most without merit or basis. For example, Seabrook objects to HHC's statement that an administrative hearing was held in April 2012 on the ground that "it is well established that state administrative proceedings not reviewed by state court do not have preclusive effect on an ADA claim," 56.1 Response ¶ 51, objects to statements that Seabrook was issued charges for misconduct as violating Federal Rule of Evidence 408, Compromise Offers and Negotiations, id. ¶ 24, and at one point objects to a written statement made by Seabrook herself because it is included in a "forty (40) page confusing hearsay document," id. ¶ 47. Because Seabrook's response largely constitutes extraneous argumentation that fails to contradict HHC's statements, the Court is unable to fully utilize it for its intended purpose. See Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., Inc., 258 F.3d 62, 74 (2d Cir. 2001) ("The purpose of Local Rule 56.1 is to streamline the consideration of summary judgment motions by [*4]  freeing district courts from the need to hunt through voluminous records without guidance from the parties."). The Court is, however, mindful that "[t]he local rule does not absolve the party seeking summary judgment of the burden of showing that it is entitIed to judgment as a matter of law, and a Local Rule 56.1 statement is not itself a vehicle for making factual assertions that are otherwise unsupported in the record." Giannullo, 322 F.3d at 140 (quoting Holtz, 258 F.3d at 74). Accordingly, to the extent the Court relies upon uncontroverted paragraphs of Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement, we do so only where the record evidence duly supports defendant's contentions and where no rule of evidence bars admission.2

II. Factual Background
Seabrook, who is currently over the age of sixty-five, began working for HHC at Bellevue Hospital in 1994 as an Office Associate. Am. Cmplt. ¶ 1; 56.1 ¶ 4. After holding several other positions within Bellevue, she was appointed to the post of Clerical Associate in 2004 upon taking the civil service exam. Id. ¶ 5. As a Clerical Associate, Level IV, Seabrook was responsible for a variety of clerical tasks, including billing, verifying insurance information, correcting remittance statements, and assisting patients with complaints and inquiries. Id. ¶ 6.
According to HHC records, Seabrook was the subject of frequent disciplinary action during her employment [*6]  at Bellevue. For instance, in April 2005, Seabrook pled no contest to charges of misconduct stemming from an incident in which she used profanity and threw documents following a confrontation with her supervisor, for which accepted a penalty of fifteen days' suspension. Id. ¶ 17; Jorgensen Decl., Ex. L. More importantly, Seabrook was repeatedly counseled and disciplined for recurrent problems with lateness and absenteeism. Performance evaluations from 1998-1999 and 2001 noted Seabrook's tardiness, and she was formally counseled by her supervisors, Sandy Jagdanan and Orrin White, about her lateness and absenteeism in February 2002, August 2003, and November 2004. 56.1 ¶¶ 8, 14-16; Jorgensen Decl., Exs. E, I, J, K.
Despite promises of improvement from Seabrook, on May 21, 2008, she was charged with misconduct arising from twenty-two instances of lateness, totaling 468 minutes, between July 2007 and May 2008. 56.1 ¶ 19; Jorgensen Decl., M. At the subsequent Step 1A Informal Conference, Seabrook accepted the recommendation of a twenty-day suspension and one-year probationary period. 56.1 ¶ 20; Jorgensen Decl., Ex. N. HHC asserts that this pattern--charges of misconduct for excessive lateness [*7]  followed by an Informal Conference, at which Seabrook would accept a suspension and period of probation--was repeated three more times in 2008 and 2009: in November 2008, Seabrook was charged with nine instances of lateness totaling 131 minutes; in April 2009, she was charged with nine instances of lateness totaling 152 minutes, as well as with violating the terms of the probation she faced as a result of the November charges and with falsifying her time sheets three times; and in November 2009, she was charged with three instances of lateness totaling 60 minutes and with falsifying a timesheet. 56.1 ¶¶ 21-22, 24-27; Jorgensen Decl., Exs. O, P, Q, R, S, T. Seabrook subsequently attended a hearing at the Office of Administrative Hearings and Trials ("OATH") regarding the April 2009 charges, at which she agreed to a sixty-day suspension of which she would serve forty-five days. 56.1 ¶ 30.
Later that year, on August 18, 2010, Seabrook sustained an injury to her back as a result of a slip and fall near a water fountain at work. Id. ¶ 31; Tr. 95-100. She began experiencing pain from the injury approximately two weeks after the incident, and she at tributes her two-week absence, from September [*8]  7 to September 20, to pain from the injury. 56.1 ¶¶ 31, 35; Tr. 98; Jorgensen Decl., Ex. Z. She first reported the injury to her supervisors on September 7, 2010, and to the Workers' Compensation Unit on October 6, 2010. 56.1 ¶ 34; Jorgensen Decl., Ex. Y.
Following her accident, Seabrook made two formal requests for medical accommodation to the Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") office at HHC: first, in December 2010, for permission to wear athletic shoes, and later, in January 2011, for restrictions to be placed on the period of time she could be required to stand and on the weight she could be required to lift. 56.1 ¶¶ 40-41. Both requests were granted. Id. Seabrook also spoke to Jagdanan and White about receiving a new chair that would better support her back. She eventually received a new chair, although it was not an orthopedic chair as Seabrook had hoped. 56.1 ¶¶ 42-43.
Meanwhile, Seabrook's attendance problems persisted. In May 2011, she was served with a new notice and statement of charges for misconduct arising from lateness and absenteeism, for which another Informal Conference was held. 56.1 ¶¶ 44-45; Jorgensen Decl., Exs. CC, DD. According to a memorandum memorializing [*9]  the conference, Seabrook asserted that the absences and tardiness were attributable to her injury, and she submitted two medical notes to substantiate two of the absences. 56.1 ¶ 46; Jorgensen Decl., Ex. DD. Nevertheless, when Seabrook was issued a performance evaluation for May 2010 to May 2011 noting her attendance problems, Seabrook acknowledged receipt and wrote on the document "Since May 2010, my tardiness has improved greatly. However, I am aware of my attendance [and] lateness." 56.1 ¶ 47; Jorgensen Declo, Ex. E.
In letters dated January 9, 2012 and February 17, 2012, Seabrook was notified that the May 2011 charges would be proceeding to an OATH hearing. 56.1 ¶¶ 48-49; Jorgensen Decl., Exs. EE, FF. Consequently, on April 4 and April 19, 2012, a hearing was held before ALJ Alessandra Zorgniotti, at which Seabrook, represented by counsel, was able to call and cross-examine witnesses and to offer documentary evidence. 56.1 ¶ 51-52; Jorgensen Decl., Ex. II. Following the hearing, Judge Zorgniotti issued a ten-page Report and Recommendation sustaining the charges and recommending termination of Seabrook's employment. 56.1 ¶ 53; Jorgensen Decl., Ex. A. On May 23, 2012, Seabrook was [*10]  notified that HHC had adopted the Report and Recommendation and that her employment was therefore terminated. 56.1 ¶ 57; Jorgensen Decl., Ex. B.
Seabrook subsequently completed an EEOC Intake Questionnaire, received by the EEOC on January 9, 2013, and the EEOC notified HHC that Seabrook had filed charges of discrimination against them under Title VII and the ADEA, alleging race, sex, age, and national origin discrimination. 56.1 ¶¶ 58-59; Jorgensen Decl., Exs. II, JJ. The EEOC ultimately issued a dismissal and notice of right to sue on March 6, 2013. 56.1 ¶ 60; Jorgensen Decl., Ex. KK.
Seabrook filed an initial complaint on June 17, 2013, and an amended complaint on June 25, 2013, which HHC answered on October 18, 2013. The complaint asserts eight counts for disability and age discrimination under the ADA, the ADEA, the NYSHRL, and the NYCHRL. HHC filed a motion for summary judgment on August 15, 2014, and this motion was fully briefed on September 26, 2014.

DISCUSSION

I. Legal Standard
A motion for summary judgment is appropriately granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In this context, "[a] fact [*11]  is 'material' when it might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law," and "[a] n issue of fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." McCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 482 F.3d 184, 202 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). "In assessing the record to determine whether there is [such] a genuine issue [of material fact] to be tried, we are required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought." Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). On a motion for summary judgment, "[t]he moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating 'the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.'" F.D.I.C. v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 607 F.3d 288, 292 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)) Where that burden is carried, the non-moving party "must come forward with specific evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact." Id. (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249). The non-moving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts . . and may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation." Brown v. Eli Lilly and Co., 654 F.3d 347, 358 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
The Second Circuit has "repeatedly emphasized 'the need for caution about granting summary [*12]  judgment to an employer in a discrimination case where . . . the merits turn on a dispute as to the employer's intent.'" Gorzynski, 596 F.3d at 101 (quoting Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 137 (2d Cir. 2008)). Nevertheless, "[t]hough caution must be exercised in granting summary judgment where intent is genuinely in issue, summary judgment remains available to rej ect discrimination claims in cases lacking genuine issues of material fact." Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 40 (2d Cir. 1994) (citation omitted). Indeed, it is well established that "summary judgment may be appropriate even in the fact-intensive context of discrimination cases." Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 239 F.3d 456, 466 (2d Cir. 2001); see also Meiri v. Dacon, 759 F.2d 989, 998 (2d Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 829, 106 S. Ct. 91, 88 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1985) ("Indeed, the salutary purposes of summary judgment--avoiding protracted, expensive and harassing trials--apply no less to discrimination cases than to commercial or other areas of litigation.").

II. Federal Claims

A. Exhaustion
As a preliminary matter, HHC contends that Seabrook's disability claim must be dismissed because Seabrook failed to exhaust her administrative remedies by failing to check the box for "disability" on her EEOC Intake Questionnaire. While exhaustion of administrative remedies is "ordinarily an essential element" of a federal discrimination claim, there is an exception for claims that are "reasonably related" to those filed in a complaint [*13]  with the EEOC or analogous state agency. Williams v. New York City Hous. Auth., 458 F.3d 67, 70 (2d Cir. 2006) (citations omitted). In determining whether claims are reasonably related, "[t]he central question is whether the complaint filed with the EEOC gave that agency adequate notice to investigate discrimination on both bases." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). This "reasonable relation" exception to the exhaustion requirement operates as "essentially an allowance of loose pleading" that is "based on the recognition that EEOC charges frequently are filled out by employees without the benefit of counsel and that their primary purpose is to alert the EEOC to the discrimination that a plaintiff claims he is suffering." Id. (citations omitted).
Although Seabrook did not check the box for disability, she did make several references to her disability on the intake form, including a description of the accident, the medication taken for the injury, and an account of requests for accommodation, and she provided a statement in the box asking "What is the disability that you believe is the reason for the adverse action taken against you?". Jorgensen Decl., Ex. II. These statements are sufficient to provide the EEOC with notice under a "loose pleading" standard [*14]  and therefore to exhaust Seabrook's disability claims.

B. ADA Claims
Seabrook argues that she was unlawfully discriminated against after she became disabled as a result of her 2010 slip and fall. Specifically, Seabrook argues that HHC failed to make reasonable accommodations for her disability after the injury, that HHC terminated her employment as a result of disability-related animus, and that HHC terminated her employment in retaliation for her attempts to seek reasonable accommodations for her disability.
In analyzing claims of failure to accommodate, discriminatory termination, and unlawful retaliation under the ADA, the Court looks to the three-part burden-shifting framework first set forth by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Young v. Benjamin Dev. Co., 03 Civ. 10209 (RJS), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18280, 2009 WL 498933, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 2009) aff'd sub nom. Young v. Benjamin Dev. Inc., 395 F. App'x 721 (2d Cir. 2010). Under this framework, a plaintiff must first point to evidence supporting a prima facie claim of discrimination under the ADA. If the plaintiff successfully establishes a prima facie case, "the burden of production (but not persuasion) shifts to the defendant 'to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for [its] decision.'" Pugliese v. Verizon New York, Inc., 05 Civ. 4005 (KMK), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52677, 2008 WL 2882092, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. July 9, 2008) (quoting Reg'l Econ. Cmty. Action Program, Inc. v. City of Middletown, 294 F.3d 35, 49 (2d Cir. 2002)) [*15] . If the employer meets that burden, the plaintiff must then raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the employer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason was merely pretextual "and that, more likely than not, discrimination was the real reason for the adverse action." Fall v. New York State United Teachers, 289 F. App'x 419, 421 (2d Cir. 2008). We address each of Seabrook's ADA claims pursuant to this framework below.

1. Reasonable Accommodation
First, Seabrook argues that HHC discriminated against her by failing to make reasonable accommodations for her disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112 (b)(5)(A) (an employer violates ADA by "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability"). "[T]he ADA contemplates that employers will engage in 'an interactive process [with their employees and in that way] work together to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated.'" Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135-36 (2d Cir. 2008) (alteration in original) (quoting Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000)). "Liability for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation ensues only when the employer is responsible for a breakdown in that process." Thompson v. City of New York, 03 Civ. 4182, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59472, 2006 WL 2457694, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2006) report and recommendation adopted, 03 Civ. 4182, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98376, 2006 WL 6357978 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2006) aff'd sub nom. Thompson v. New York City Dept. of Prob., 348 F. Appx. 643 (2d Cir. 2009). An employer can be said have impeded [*16]  the process when "the employer knows of the employee's disability; the employee requests accommodations or assistance; the employer does not in good faith assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith." Goonan v. Fed. Reserve Bank of New York, 916 F. Supp. 2d 470, 480-81 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) reconsideration denied, 12 Civ. 3859 JPO, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49729, 2013 WL 1386933 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2013). An employee's failure to make a request is not fatal to a claim for a reasonable accommodation; however, such a failure traditionally counsels against the claim as "[g]enerally it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.'" Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Nixon-Tinkelman v. New York City Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 434 F. App'x 17, 19 (2d Cir. 2011).
Here, Seabrook's reasonable accommodation claims fail because she has provided no evidence that HHC failed to make any accommodations in the wake of her injury. Seabrook admits that she made only two formal requests for medical accommodation during her time at HHC--to wear athletic shoes and to have standing and weight-lifting limitations--and that both of these requests were granted. When Seabrook made an informal entreaty for a new chair, she was likewise provided one. Indeed, while her complaint alleges that a panoply of other requests made and denied, [*17]  Seabrook herself explicitly states that every request for accommodation made was granted.3 See Tr. 134 ("Was there any accommodation request that was not approved?" "I only did two. Two accommodations.". . . "No requests were denied?" "No."). Nor has Seabrook shown any accommodations or alterations that, while unrequested by Seabrook herself, HHC should nevertheless have known to have provided. See, e.g., Witchard v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., 05 Civ. 5957 (JSR), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19456, 2009 WL 602884, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2009) ("Although the covered entity is required to initiate an interactive process, the ADA also requires that the employee participate and specify fully the necessary accommodations and options. The employee's cooperation and continued engagement is of paramount importance."); Exarhakis v. Visiting Nurse Serv. of New York, 02 Civ. 5562 (ILG), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5360, 2006 WL 335420, at *12 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 13, 2006) ("The plaintiff bears the burden of production and persuasion of identifying the job at issue and whether an accommodation exists that would permit her to perform the essential functions of that job."). Rather, in light of the record of HHC's acquiescence to Seabrook's requests when made, we cannot say that HHC impeded the process of reasonable accommodation, and Seabrook's claim is therefore [*18]  dismissed.

2. Termination
Seabrook next argues that her termination was the product of discriminatory animus toward her disability. To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory termination under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish that: "(1) plaintiff's employer is subject to the ADA; (2) plaintiff was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) plaintiff was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) plaintiff suffered [an] adverse employment action because of her disability." Jacques v. DiMarzio, Inc., 386 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir. 2004) (alteration in original) (citing Cameron V. Cmty Aid for Retarded Children, Inc., 335 F.3d 60, 63 (2d Cir. 2003)).
However, even assuming that Seabrook can make out a prima facie case of discriminatory termination, this claim must fail at the latter steps of the McDonnell framework because Seabrook has not provided any evidence whatsoever to suggest [*19]  that HHC's "well-chronicled reason for terminating her--chronic tardiness and [discipline problems]--was a pretext for discrimination." Farina v. Branford Bd. of Educ., 458 F. App'x 13, 16 (2d Cir. 2011). Rather, Judge Zorgniotti's decision and the long paper trail of disciplinary action regarding Seabrook's attendance problems--with formal charges of misconduct issued at least as early as 2008, well before Seabrook's accident--provide firm support for HHC's contention that Seabrook was terminated as a result of her repeated absences and lateness.
Notably, Seabrook has not amassed any facts to contradict HHC's proffered justification but instead attacks HHC's reliance on Judge Zorgniotti's decision, arguing that as an unreviewed state administrative hearing its findings cannot be given preclusive effect. While Seabrook is correct regarding the preclusive impact of Judge Zorgniotti's decision, she provides no evidence to suggest that the proceeding, at which Seabrook called and examined witnesses and offered documentary evidence, was biased or incomplete. Absent new evidence or a reason to question the integrity of those proceedings, Judge Zorgniotti's decision thus retains strong "probative weight regarding the requisite causal link between an employee's [*20]  termination and the employer's illegal motive." Collins v. New York City Transit Authority, 305 F.3d 113, 120 (2d Cir. 2002). See also Mazur v. New York City Dep't of Educ., 12 Civ. 0687, 53 F. Supp. 3d 618, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132203, 2014 WL 4651943, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, 2014) ("[T]he fact that a neutral hearing officer rendered a decision based on substantial evidence that found just cause to discipline Plaintiff and found her defenses of age and disability discrimination to be without merit is [thus] 'highly probative of the absence of discriminatory intent.'") (quoting Collins, 305 F.3d at 119). Because Seabrook has merely disputed the admissibility of the OATH hearing and has offered no evidence to suggest either that its findings were inaccurate or that HHC's proffered justification was otherwise pretextual, her discriminatory termination claim is also dismissed. See Young v. Benjamin Dev. Co., 03 Civ. 10209 (RJS), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18280, 2009 WL 498933, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 2009) aff'd sub nom. Young v. Benjamin Dev. Inc., 395 F. App'x 721 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding no discrimination where "[pl]aintiff has presented no new evidence to offset the force of the arbitrator's reasoning and failed to establish a causal link between his putative 'disability' and his termination").

3. Retaliation
Finally, Seabrook argues that she was fired in retaliation for her attempts to engage in a process of reasonable accommodation. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show: (1) that she has participated [*21]  in a protected activity; (2) that the defendant knew of the protected activity; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. McMenemy v. City of Rochester, 241 F.3d 279, 282-83 (2d Cir. 2001).
Here, Seabrook has failed to adduce any evidence of a causal connection between her requests for accommodation and her termination beyond the mere assertion that her termination was retaliatory. What's more, Seabrook's requests for accommodation were made in late 2010 and early 2011, over a year before her employment was terminated--a temporal gap that further belies a causal connection between her requests for accommodation and her termination. See, e.g., Jones v. New York City Bd. of Educ., 09 Civ. 4815, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47128, 2012 WL 1116906, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2012) ("District courts in this circuit consistently have found that an intervening period of more than two to three months is insufficient to establish a causal connection through temporal proximity alone.").
In addition, as with her discriminatory termination claim, Seabrook's retaliation claim must fail at McDonnell's latter stages, as she has failed to provide any evidence sufficient to overcome HHC's proffered nondiscriminatory reason for her termination, namely her repeated [*22]  attendance and discipline problems. See, e.g., Collins v. New York City Transit Auth., 305 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir. 2002) ("Collins has offered insufficient evidence of causation linking his termination to motives of retaliation or discrimination to overcome the cumulative probative weight of the evidence of a legitimate reason for his discharge and of the final termination decision by the arbitration board."). Indeed, Seabrook herself admitted that she did not believe that she was being retaliated against on the basis of her disability. See Tr. 195 ("Why do you believe that [HHC] was retaliating against you?". . . "I have no idea. I don't know." "Do you believe it was because of your back injury?" "No. No."). Accordingly, this claim is dismissed.

C. ADEA Claims
Seabrook also contends that her termination was the result of age-based animus and/or made in retaliation for her attempts to oppose age discrimination. As under the ADA, such claims of discrimination under the ADEA are analyzed in accordance with McDonnell's three-step evidentiary burden-shifting framework. See, e.g., Mikinberg v. Bemis Co., 555 F. App'x 34, 35 (2d Cir. 2014) (applying McDonnell to age-based discriminatory termination claim); Wanamaker v. Columbian Rope Co., 108 F.3d 462, 465 (2d Cir. 1997) (applying McDonnell to age-based retaliatory discharge claim). In addition, in the age discrimination context, the [*23]  plaintiff "must prove not only that the proffered nondiscriminatory reason was pretextual but also that the discrimination was the real reason." McDonald v. United States Postal Serv. Agency, 547 F. App'x 23, 25 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, she must prove "that age was the 'but-for' cause of the challenged adverse employment action and not just a contributing or motivating factor." Gorzynski, 596 F.3d at 106 (internal quotation mark omitted)
As with Seabrook's disability discrimination claims, even assuming arguendo that she has made out a prima facie case, her age discrimination claims fail because she has provided no evidence that age was a factor in her termination, let alone its but-for cause. Seabrook bases her age discrimination claims entirely on the fact that on "two occasions she was asked about her retirement plans from her supervisors."4 Pl's Opp'n at 19. However, "even if plaintiff was asked about h[er] retirement plans, inquiries about retirement plans do[] not necessarily show animosity towards age." Getler v. Cornell Weill Univ. Med. Coll. Dep't of Surgery, 05 Civ. 8550 (CLB), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 380, 2007 WL 38276, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2007) aff'd sub nom. Getler v. Cornell Weill Univ. Med. Coll., 315 F. App'x 355 (2d Cir. 2009) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, such stray remarks are routinely dismissed unless accompanied by further indicia [*24]  of age-related animus. See, e.g., id. ("In the absence of any other evidence supporting a finding of discrimination, such a stray remark is insufficient to satisfy Plaintiff's burden of creating a genuine issue of material fact concerning pretext."); Fried v. LVI Servs., Inc., 500 F. App'x 39, 41 (2d Cir. 2012) (finding that question posed by CEO six weeks prior to plaintiff's termination, "you're 71 years of age, how long do you expect to work? What if you're hit by a bus?", "cannot bear th[e] weight [of showing but-for causation] when considered against the overwhelming documentary evidence supporting LVI's articulated non-discriminatory reason for terminating Fried"); Boston v. Macfadden Pub., Inc., 09 Civ. 457 RJH, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103294, 2010 WL 3785541, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2010) (no discrimination where the only evidence plaintiff advanced was that supervisors "talk[ed] of his retirement" and plaintiff failed to "adducer[] evidence of any context surrounding the discussions of retirement that would raise a reasonable inference that the discussions evinced age-related animus").
Here, Seabrook claims that she was once asked by White "out of the blue" "when [she] was going to leave," Tr. 179-80, and that she had a conversation with Jagdanan regarding her retirement after she submitted a request to visit the New York City Retirement System, Tr. 180--surely, a reasonable time to inquire whether an employee intended to retire in the near future.5 Moreover, Seabrook could not recall the details of either conversation, and repeatedly insisted that she could not describe the conversations' context or "what they said verbatim." Tr. 183; see also, e.g., Tr. 180 ("Do you remember the context?" "I can't remember. . . . I can't recall any of the conversation."); id. ("He didn't say anything about your age, did he?" "I don't remember that. I don't recall."). Because Seabrook has adduced no evidence to suggest these remarks were made with, or in any way supported by other evidence of, age-related animus, her age discrimination claims are therefore dismissed. [*26] 

III. State and City Claims
In addition to her federal claims, Seabrook asserts analogous claims for age and disability discrimination under State and City law. However, because claims under the NYSHRL and NYCHRL are considered alongside federal discrimination claims at the latter stages of the McDonnell analysis, these claims also fail as a result of Seabrook's failure to show that HHC's legitimate and nondiscriminatory justification was pretextual or that HHC acted with discriminatory animus. See, e.g., Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006) ("In light of our conclusion that defendants had a legitimate nondiscriminatory basis for dismissing Sista, we need not reach the question of whether Sista could make out a prima facie case of discrimination based on a disability under federal or state law."); Doe v. Major Model Mgmt. Inc., 11 Civ. 6182 KBF, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32064, 2012 WL 763556, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2012) ("Plaintiff has also asserted claims under the New York State Human Rights Law, [*27]  N.Y. Exec. Law § 290 et seq., and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y. City Admin. Code § 8-107, against all defendants for discrimination and retaliation on the basis of disability. Because claims under those state and city statutes are subject to McDonnell Douglas burden shifting, and because, as discussed above, defendants have offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for plaintiff's termination which plaintiff has failed to rebut, the Court finds that defendants are entitled to summary judgment on those claims as well."); Stavis v. GFK Holding, Inc., 769 F. Supp. 2d 330, 339 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) ("[I]t is easier for Plaintiff to prevail on his NYCHRL age discrimination claim than his parallel NYSHRL claim. Nevertheless, Plaintiff cannot even meet this easier standard because he presents no evidence . . . rebutting Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating him."); Pagan v. Morrisania Neighborhood Family Health Ctr., 12 Civ. 9047 WHP, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14978, 2014 WL 464787, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2014) ("[While t]he NYCHRL is broader than the ADEA and NYSHRL [and] while the New York City Council may provide a different substantive standard to be applied to particular claims in federal court, the same federal procedural rules apply . . . [and require that] a plaintiff must [*28]  still allege facts giving rise to an inference of discrimination.") (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 107 (2d Cir. 2010)). Seabrook's state and city claims are therefore dismissed.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, HHC's motion for summary judgment is granted in full. This Memorandum and Order resolves Docket No. 26, and the Clerk of Court is respectfully requested to close this case.
SO ORDERED.
