AMENDED SCHEDULING ORDER

JS-6: Defendant Eric Anderson Only

I. Introduction
On January 19, 2018, Alan Carrico ("Plaintiff") brought this action in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Complaint, Dkt. 1-2. The following three defendants remain parties: Continental Casualty Company ("Continental"), CNA Financial Corporation ("CNA Financial"), and Eric Anderson ("Anderson").1 The Complaint advances seven causes of action: (i) discrimination, retaliation, and harassment based on disability and age, failure to engage in the interactive process, and failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation for complaining of disability and age in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12900, et seq.; (ii) breach of express oral contract not to terminate employment without good cause; (iii) breach of implied-in-fact contract [*2]  not to terminate employment without good cause; (iv) negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; (v) wrongful termination of employment in violation of public policy; (vi) retaliation in violation of the California whistleblower protection law, Cal. Cab. Code § 1102.5; and (vii) intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED").
On February 21, 2018, Continental, with the consent of the other defendants, removed the action on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Dkt. 1. The Notice of Removal states that Plaintiff's citizenship (California) is different from that of both Continental (Illinois) and CNA Financial (Delaware and Illinois). Notice of Removal, Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 8, 9, 14. The Notice of Removal acknowledges that Anderson, like Plaintiff, is also a citizen of California, which would preclude diversity jurisdiction. Id. ¶ 15. However, the Notice of Removal argues that Anderson's citizenship should be disregarded because he "was fraudulently joined as a sham defendant." Id. ¶¶ 16-22.
On December 11, 2018, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment (the "MSJ"). Dkt. 55. Plaintiff filed an opposition (Dkt. 73), and Defendants replied. Dkt. 78. A hearing on the MSJ was scheduled for March [*3]  25, 2019. Dkt. 83. However, on March 19, 2019, an Order to Show Cause re Subject Matter Jurisdiction (the "OSC" (Dkt. 84)) was issued because the Notice of Removal did not present a sufficient basis to establish that Anderson was a sham defendant. The parties were required to file briefs in response to the OSC. The OSC reset the hearing on the MSJ pending briefing on the jurisdictional issue. On March 26, 2019, the requested simultaneous supplemental briefs regarding jurisdiction were filed. See Dkt. 88 ("Plaintiff's Jurisdiction Brief"); Dkt. 87 ("Defendants' Jurisdiction Brief").
A hearing was conducted on June 24, 2019 as to both the OSC and the MSJ, and both were then taken under submission. Dkt. 94. For the reasons stated in this Order, the OSC is DISCHARGED and Anderson is DISMISSED as a fraudulently joined defendant. The MSJ is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART,2 as follows:


II. Factual Background
A. Allegations of the Complaint3
The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff began working as a staff attorney for the entity Defendants in 1999. Complaint, Dkt. 1-2 ¶ 8. He was employed in that position by Defendants for approximately 18 years, until he was terminated in September 2017. Id. ¶ 13. At all relevant times, Anderson was his supervisor -- although at one time during his tenure Plaintiff also reported to a different supervisor. Id. ¶¶ 2, 10.
In May 2014, Plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which a large delivery truck struck the rear of his vehicle while he was driving. Id. ¶ 10. He sustained a traumatic brain injury as a result of this collision. [*5]  Id. This has resulted in cognitive impairment. Id. For the next two years, he continued to report to work and manage a full case load. Id. However, he alleges that he began to fall behind on his work in April 2016 as a result of his disability. Id.
The Complaint alleges that, in June 2016, Anderson informed Plaintiff he had fallen behind on certain reporting requirements. Id. Plaintiff contacted the Leave Administration department around that time, but declined to reduce his hours because he was concerned this would leave him behind on his reporting and billable hours requirements. Id. Later that month, Anderson increased Plaintiff's caseload by approximately ten to 12 cases after two associate attorneys left the company. Id. During the last several months of 2016, Plaintiff continued to have difficulty completing and submitting his case reports in a timely manner. Id.
In January 2017, Anderson and Plaintiff discussed Plaintiff's continued difficulties with meeting his reporting requirements. Id. At that time, Plaintiff requested a 25% reduction in his caseload based on the advice of his treating physician. Id. Katherine Finzer ("Finzer"), an employee in Defendants' Leave Administration [*6]  department, informed Plaintiff that his request was denied because a full case load was an essential function of his position. Id. She stated that unless he provided a revised note from a physician stating that he could perform this essential function, he would be required to go on short term disability. Id. Plaintiff declined to request a new assessment from his physician, stating that he did not believe that doing so would be "appropriate, legal, []or ethical." Id.
On or about March 1, 2017, Plaintiff took a leave for short term disability and sought treatment for his brain injury. Id. While on leave, he remained in contact with Defendants' employees regarding his medical condition. Id. This included informing Anderson in July 2017 that he had been admitted to a particular treatment program and hoped to return to work at the end of August 2017. Id. He later informed Defendants that he anticipated his treatment would continue through the end of September 2017. Id.
On September 18, 2017, Defendants terminated Plaintiff's employment. Id. ¶ 13. The stated reason was that "there had been a downturn in tort files and as a result of that downturn, [Plaintiff's] services were no longer needed." [*7]  Id. The Complaint alleges that the stated reason for termination was "clearly pretextual" after his requested accommodation for his condition had been "flat out denied." Id. The termination "sent [Plaintiff] into an emotional tailspin." Id.
As noted, the Complaint advances seven causes of action: (i) discrimination, retaliation, and harassment based on disability and age, failure to engage in the interactive process, and failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation for complaining of disability and age in violation of FEHA; (ii) breach of express oral contract not to terminate employment without good cause; (iii) breach of implied-in-fact contract not to terminate employment without good cause; (iv) negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; (v) wrongful termination of employment in violation of public policy; (vi) retaliation in violation of the California whistleblower protection law; and (vii) IIED.
As to the OSC, Anderson is named as a defendant to two of those causes of action: the portion of the first cause of action that alleges harassment based on disability and age, and the seventh cause of action for IIED.
B. Evidence Submitted in Connection with the MSJ [*8] 
Each party has submitted voluminous evidence in support of its position on the MSJ. See Defendants' Statement of Facts and Conclusions of Law ("DSF"), Dkt. 55-2; Defendants' Appendix of Evidence in Support of MSJ ("Defendants' Evidence"), Dkt. 55-3, 55-4; Plaintiff's Statement of Facts and Conclusions of Law ("PSF"), Dkt. 75; Plaintiff's Declarations in Support of Opposition, Dkts. 73-2 to 73-6; Plaintiff's Appendix of Evidence in Opposition to MSJ, Dkts. 73-7 to 73-121 ("Plaintiff's Evidence"). The relevant evidence shows the following:
1. Plaintiff's Employment Before Motor Vehicle Accident
Plaintiff, who was 62 years old when the MSJ was filed, began working for the entity Defendants as a staff attorney in 1999. DSF ¶ 1. Plaintiff has produced evidence that he received positive performance reviews during his tenure. See Plaintiff's Evidence Exhibit 1, Dkt. 73-8. His first supervisor was Linda Libertucci ("Libertucci"), and he was later supervised by Anderson, with one period when he was supervised by both. Plaintiff's Response to DSF, Dkt. 74 ¶ 2.
Plaintiff's position was as a "band 260" litigation attorney. DSF ¶ 4. This title meant that he was assigned to litigate lower-level tort [*9]  cases -- which the company defined as those for which the ultimate payment was expected to be less than $150,000. Id. The position included the management of all stages of litigation. Id. ¶ 5. That required traditional litigation tasks like fact investigations and court appearances as well as case management that required reports at regular intervals throughout the litigation. See Plaintiff's Response to DSF ¶ 8 (undisputed that listed job duties included those related to case management). Plaintiff's caseload generally required him to bill approximately 35 to 40 hours per week. Deposition of Alan Carrico ("Carrico Depo.") at 52:20-24. He testified that this meant that he had to work approximately 45 to 50 hours per week. Id. He was required to meet an annual billable hours requirement that, by the end of his employment, was approximately 1830 hours per year. DSF ¶ 7; see also Plaintiff's Response to DSF ¶ 7 (clarifying relevant timeframe).
2. Motor Vehicle Accident and Its Consequences
As noted, in May 2014, a truck struck the rear of Plaintiff's vehicle while he was driving on a freeway. DSF ¶ 14. Plaintiff suffered symptoms from the accident. Carrico Depo. at 26:1-27:24. He testified [*10]  that these symptoms included neurological ones, such as a decrease in his "processing speed." Id. Shortly after the accident, Plaintiff took a pre-planned vacation. DSF ¶ 15. He then returned to work. Id. However, he testified that he told Libertucci about a month after the accident that he was "struggling." Carrico Depo. at 58:16-59:13. Libertucci advised him to take a week off, which he did. Id. Plaintiff also saw a physician approximately two months after the accident; on July 22, 2014, that physician signed a note stating that Plaintiff could "return to work without restriction." Defendant's Evidence Exhibit B-1, Dkt. 55-3 at 217.
For approximately the next two years, Plaintiff continued to work without formally requesting an accommodation for the injuries he had suffered in the accident. Declaration of Alan Carrico ("Carrico Decl.") ¶ 37. During that time, he did not timely complete certain pre-trial reports for the cases to which he was assigned. See Plaintiff's Response to DSF ¶ 16; Carrico Depo. at 79:13-24; Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit B-4, Dkt. 55-3 at 221. Plaintiff also was at times not on pace to meet his annual billable hours requirement, although there is evidence that [*11]  he successfully met that requirement by the end of each applicable year. See Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit B-5, Dkt. 55-3 at 224-31; Deposition of Eric Anderson ("Anderson Depo.") at 48:11-14; Plaintiff's Response to DSF ¶ 16. Issues related to timely reports and Plaintiff's pace toward achieving billable hours requirements were reflected in Plaintiff's performance review for 2015. It was completed by Anderson, and was generally positive about Plaintiff's performance. See Defendants' Response to PSF, Dkt. 80 ¶ 28.
It is undisputed that the earliest discussion between Anderson and Plaintiff regarding whether he should contact Leave Administration to seek an accommodation for his injuries occurred in mid-2016. See Defendants' Response to PSF ¶ 35. However, Plaintiff has filed a declaration, which he contends is supported by his contemporaneous handwritten notes submitted in opposition to the MSJ, that in January 2015 at the latest, he "regularly informed Anderson about [his] cognitive issues and how they were affecting [his] work." Carrico Decl. ¶ 20.
Independent of what may have preceded the mid-2016 discussion, it is undisputed that there was one in or about May or June of 2016 between [*12]  Carrico and Anderson. At that time they discussed the following matters: (i) Carrico told Anderson that the reason he was behind on reporting requirements and not on pace to meet his billable hours requirement was that he was experiencing cognitive difficulties that resulted from the 2014 collision, Plaintiff's Response to DSF ¶¶ 18-19; and (ii) Anderson suggested that Carrico consider requesting an accommodation from the Leave Administration department, id; Defendants' Response to PSF ¶ 35. After that conversation, Plaintiff spoke by telephone with Finzer of the Leave Administration Department. Plaintiff testified that Finzer suggested a possible accommodation through reduced work hours, but Plaintiff declined to make that request because it would leave him further behind on his responsibilities. Carrico Depo. at 95:16-96:7. There is evidence that Finzer provided Plaintiff with certain paperwork on June 17, 2016, through which he could request an accommodation, and then sent two related, follow-up emails in July 2016. See Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit B-17, Dkt. 55-3 at 267-268. However, Plaintiff neither completed this paperwork nor responded to the emails. See Plaintiff's Evidence, [*13]  Exhibit 3, Dkt. 73-10 at 6.
Plaintiff's year-end performance review for 2016 ("partially meets expectations") was below his prior review ("meets expectations"). Plaintiff attributes this change to his difficulty timely submitting pretrial reports, which he states was a result of symptoms resulting from the motor vehicle accident. Carrico Depo. at 87:18-89:19. It is undisputed that Plaintiff was approximately 25% behind on certain reporting requirements during the last quarter of 2016. See Plaintiff's Response to DSF ¶ 29. Plaintiff recalled discussing these difficulties with Anderson in early 2017, and that Anderson suggested that he contact Finzer to "ask for an accommodation." Carrico Depo. at 89:17-91:11.
On January 24, 2017, Finzer had separate conversations with Anderson and Plaintiff. See Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit I, Dkt. 55-4 at 55-56. Plaintiff testified that during his conversation with Finzer, she said that he could request an accommodation by having his physician fill out a form. Carrico Depo. at 96:9-97:6. Plaintiff recalls Finzer telling him during this conversation that the physician would "need . . . to be very specific about what it is that he or she wants accommodated, [*14]  just for example, a reduction in hours or reduction in case load, a percentage." Id. at 96:21-24. Plaintiff recalled responding that, unlike his 2016 decision on whether to submit a request for accommodation, he would "concede" to make such a request. He testified that, although a reduction in hours "wasn't going to help [him]," a reduction in "the case count" would. Id. at 96:25-97:4. The same day, Finzer sent Plaintiff a "Request for Accommodation" form that was to be filled out by a physician. See Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit B-11; Plaintiff's Response to DSF ¶ 28. It is undisputed that Plaintiff then saw Dr. Zackler and informed him that he was approximately 25% behind in his reporting requirements. DSF ¶ 29. On January 31, 2017, Dr. Zackler completed the Request for Accommodation form, in which he recommended that Plaintiff reduce his case load by 25% in light of his injuries from the 2014 incident. Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit B-2, Dkt. 55-3 at 219. Dr. Zackler also stated that Plaintiff's cognitive impairments were likely to be permanent. Id.
On February 13, 2017, Anderson, Finzer, and three others met to discuss Plaintiff's performance and his request to reduce his caseload [*15]  by 25%. See Plaintiff's Response to DSF ¶ 32 (undisputed that this conversation occurred); Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 10, Dkt. 73-18 (notes made by Anderson that purport to memorialize this conversation). Anderson's notes from this meeting reflect that "[t]he first issue addressed was [Plaintiff's] 2016 performance" -- as noted, the evaluation concluded that he "[p]artially [m]eets" expectations. Id. Anderson was given permission to deliver the performance review to Plaintiff. Id. at 2. Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 10, Dkt. 73-18 at 2.
The next topic, as reflected in these notes, was "whether a 25% reduction in [Plaintiff's] caseload would be an accommodation that could be implemented." Id. However, Anderson and Jefferi Hamilton ("Hamilton"), who is also an attorney, "repeatedly stated that the threshold question . . . was whether [Plaintiff] was competent to continue to practice law" in light of the issues that had been presented regarding Plaintiff's difficulty processing information and failure to remember whether he had completed reports. Id. Anderson was concerned that these difficulties might cause similar problems during "a legal argument in court" or the task of "ask[ing] all the [*16]  necessary questions in a deposition." Id. Anderson's notes state that at the end of this conversation, "no decision had been made with regard to whether a 25% reduction in [Plaintiff's] caseload was workable." Id. at 3.
On February 14, 2017, Plaintiff and Finzer spoke again. According to Plaintiff's account of that conversation, Finzer informed him that a 25% reduction in his caseload was something that his employer "can't accommodate . . . at all." Carrico Depo. at 73:10.4 Plaintiff testified that, in response he said: "Then, fine, I'll just revoke the request. I'm working. I'll get through this. I'll be okay." Id. at 73:10-12. However, his recollection is that Finzer replied that would not be possible; instead, he would have two options: (i) obtain a physician's note that "says that you're a hundred percent fine"; or (ii) take a leave of absence for his disability. Id. at 73:13-15. Plaintiff responded that he would not request a new physician's note because he believed that doing so would constitute an unethical request to his doctor to change the diagnosis. Id. at 73:16-20.
Plaintiff also testified that he recalls complaining to an office manager and a co-worker about Finzer's response, [*17]  because he considered it to have been unethical. Id. at 225:6-229:4. Plaintiff's declaration states that, in the remainder of the conversation, he requested "a short reprieve on [his] reporting so that [he] could catch up," which Finzer also said was not possible because "reporting is an essential function of [his] role." Carrico Decl., Dkt. 73-3 ¶ 41. The next day, Finzer sent an email that memorialized this stated basis for declining to accommodate the requests. See Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 21, Dkt. 73-29 at 3.
When Finzer followed up with Plaintiff on February 27, 2017 to find out how Plaintiff planned to proceed, he informed her that he planned to take a leave for short term disability. Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 21, Dkt. 73-29 at 2-3. Plaintiff's last day of work before beginning his leave was February 28, 2017. See id.; Plaintiff's Response to DSF ¶ 40. It is undisputed that Plaintiff never returned to work between this time and his termination more than six months later. Plaintiff's Response to DSF ¶ 40.
3. Leave and Termination
After Plaintiff went on leave, various measures were taken to manage the tort cases that had been assigned to him. Anderson testified that initially, [*18]  he took over some of Plaintiff's cases, requiring him to at times work between "14 to 16 hours a day . . . to make sure that the clients had representation." Anderson Depo. at 247:7-12. In June 2017, a new attorney, Paul Newman ("Newman"), was hired. Id. at 263:4-12. Newman was hired in part to handle employment practices liability insurance ("EPLI") defense matters. Anderson Decl., Dkt. 55-3 at 13 ¶ 15. However, as Defendants "were waiting for [Newman] to ramp up with files" within that specialization, Anderson "assigned the vast majority of [Plaintiff's] files to [Newman]." Anderson Depo. at 263:6-10.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff's leave was extended several times based on his ongoing medical condition and treatment. See Defendant's Response to PSF ¶ 120. There is evidence suggesting that between May 2017 and July 2017, several individuals, including both Anderson and Finzer, scheduled meetings to address the status of Plaintiff's leave. PSF ¶¶ 121-26. A similar meeting was scheduled for August 30, 2017. The day before that meeting, an individual in the Leave Administration department informed several people, including Anderson, that Plaintiff had extended his leave through the [*19]  end of September. Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 38, Dkt. 73-46. When Anderson learned about that extension, he wrote a memorandum to a group of Defendants' employees stating that he was "not sure how this factors into" the planned August 30 discussion. Id. The memorandum was sent to Hamilton, Fath, Lauren Slade ("Slade") and Marie Fang ("Fang"). Id.
On August 30, 2017, there was a discussion among Anderson and some of those to whom he had sent the email. Hamilton (an attorney, see Declaration of Jefferi Hamilton ("Hamilton Decl."), Dkt. 55-3 at 29-33) and Fang (an individual in the human resources department) have provided somewhat different accounts regarding the primary topic of discussion on August 30. Hamilton testified that it "was about [Plaintiff's] leave generally" but she does not recall if "any other details . . . were discussed." Deposition of Jefferi Hamilton ("Hamilton Depo.") at 212:4-16. She also recalled that the potential elimination of Plaintiff's position was discussed "around August [or] September," but did not specifically state that the discussion occurred on August 30.
Fang testified that the discussion was about "rightsizing," i.e., a potential reduction in force. [*20]  Deposition of Marie Fang ("Fang Depo.") at 102:6-15. Fang handwrote a note dated September 7, 2017. Plaintiff argues that it corresponds to a follow-up meeting among Fang, Hamilton and Anderson. See Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 47; Opposition, Dkt. 73 at 19. The note, titled "Jefferi / Carrico," states that there was not "enough work to go around to all 260 [attorneys]," presumably a reference to the "band 260" group in which Carrico worked. Id. It also states that the number of tort files for such attorneys "do not support 2" attorneys. Id. Finally, it included the following: "* Allan [sic], Oct. return, tell him asap." Id.
It is undisputed that several persons, including Anderson, Hamilton, Fath and Fang, were involved in a discussion of a Reduction in Force ("RIF") in September 2017. See Defendants' Response to PSF ¶ 139. On September 10, 2017, Fang distributed to Anderson and Hamilton a "skills assessment" template for them to complete. Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 48, Dkt. 73-56. On September 12, 2017, Anderson sent two emails in which he described a reduction in the number of tort cases that would be handled by band 260 attorneys. Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibits 49-50, Dkt. 73-57, [*21]  73-58. The stated reduction was from 319 pending tort cases open as of January 2017 to 269 files at the end of August, which corresponded with a similar decrease in the number of new tort cases opened during that period. Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibits 49-50, Dkt. 73-57, 73-58; see also Anderson Decl. ¶ 14.
On September 13, 2017, a memorandum regarding the reduction in force was finalized. It stated that Plaintiff would be the only one terminated as a result of "a reduction in force of one Southern CA Litigation Attorney who performs Tort work." Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 51, Dkt. 73-59 at 2-10 (the "RIF Memo"); see also Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit R, Dkt. 55-4 at 117-30 (same document with certain redactions). The RIF Memo stated that, based on the decline in the number of tort files, two band 260 attorneys who perform primarily tort work would be considered for a RIF: Plaintiff and Newman. RIF Memo, Dkt. 73-59 at 3. The RIF Memo includes a one-page numerical "skills assessment," which was completed by Anderson with input from Hamilton. See id. at 7; Anderson Depo. at 295:21-296:17 (testifying that he and Hamilton filled this out while they were conversing); Hamilton Depo. at 228:22-231:11 [*22]  (testifying that Anderson input the numbers and Hamilton reviewed them). The skills assessment included ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 in each of five categories, which were combined using weighting to calculate an overall score. RIF Memo, Dkt. 73-59 at 7. Newman was assigned a score of either 3.00 or 4.00 for each category, with an overall score of 3.30. Id. Plaintiff was assigned category scores of either 1.50, 2.00, or 2.50 -- i.e., lower than Newman's scores in each category -- and an overall score of 1.85. Id. The RIF Memo states that based on this assessment, Plaintiff was selected for termination, notwithstanding that he had 18.35 years of experience compared to a few months for Newman. Id. at 3. It also noted that, although Plaintiff was "exclusively focused on Tort work," Newman was "building an [employment practices litigation] practice." Id.
On Friday, September 15, 2017, Fath called Plaintiff. Because Plaintiff was in his vehicle at the time he received the call, the two set up a time to speak the following Monday, September 18, 2017. Carrico Depo. at 136:1-9. When they spoke on September 18, Plaintiff began the conversation by stating that he would need to push back his return to [*23]  work date in light of his physician's postponement of an upcoming appointment. Id. at 135:7-12. Plaintiff recalls Fath responding that this "doesn't matter anymore" because he did not "have a job to return to." Id. at 135:13-14; see also Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit B-15 (email from Fath to Anderson summarizing conversation with Plaintiff).

III. Subject Matter Jurisdiction
A. Legal Standards
1. Removal and Subject Matter Jurisdiction
In general, a state civil action may be removed only if, at the time of removal, it is one over which there is federal jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). Because federal courts are ones of limited jurisdiction, the removal statute is to be strictly construed, and any doubt as to the appropriateness of removal is to be resolved in favor of remand. Gaus v. Miles, Inc., 980 F.2d 564, 566 (9th Cir. 1992). Thus, the removing party has the burden of establishing that removal is proper, including that there is federal jurisdiction over one or more of the claims. Id.
As a court of limited jurisdiction, see Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S. Ct. 1673, 128 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1994), a district court must determine the issue of subject matter jurisdiction before reaching the merits as to any matter presented. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't , 523 U.S. 83, 94, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998). Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. Instead, federal courts "have an independent" -- and [*24]  ongoing -- "obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party." Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 501, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006); see 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) ("If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.").
2. Diversity Jurisdiction and Fraudulent Joinder
Federal courts have diversity jurisdiction where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the adverse parties are citizens of different states. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332, 1441. Complete diversity of citizenship is required, i.e., "the citizenship of each plaintiff [must be] different from that of each defendant." Hunter v. Philip Morris USA, 582 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir. 2009).
Fraudulent joinder "is a term of art." Morris v. Princess Cruises, Inc., 236 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir. 2001). "Joinder of a non-diverse defendant is deemed fraudulent, and the defendant's presence in the lawsuit is ignored for purposes of determining diversity, if the plaintiff fails to state a cause of action against a resident defendant, and the failure is obvious according to the settled rules of the state." Id. (internal quotations and brackets omitted). To show that a defendant has been fraudulently joined, "the individual[] joined in the action cannot be liable on any theory." Ritchey v. Upjohn Drug Co., 139 F.3d 1313, 1318 (9th Cir. 1998). Thus, provided that there is a "non-fanciful possibility that [*25]  plaintiff can state a claim under [state] law against the nondiverse defendants," a joinder is not deemed fraudulent. Mireles v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 845 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1062 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (quoting Macey v. Allstate Property & Cas. Ins. Co., 220 F. Supp. 2d 1116, 1117 (N.D. Cal. 2002)) (brackets in original).
When a non-diverse defendant is named in a complaint filed in a state court, "the party seeking removal bears a heavy burden of proving that the joinder of the in-state party was improper." Hunter, 582 F.3d at 1044 (internal citation, quotation marks, and alteration omitted); see also Grancare, LLC v. Thrower by & through Mills, 889 F.3d 543, 548 (9th Cir. 2018) ("A defendant invoking federal court diversity jurisdiction on the basis of fraudulent joinder bears a 'heavy burden' since there is a 'general presumption against finding fraudulent joinder.'") (brackets and citation omitted). To carry this burden, the removing party must "demonstrate[] that there is no possibility that [a plaintiff] could prevail against [any non-diverse defendants]." Grancare, 889 F.3d at 551. Further, a court "must resolve all material ambiguities in state law in plaintiff's favor" on a motion to remand. Macey, 220 F. Supp. 2d at 1117. "When there are real ambiguities among the relevant state law authorities, federal courts that are considering motions to remand should avoid purporting to decide how state courts would construe those authorities." Id. at 1118.
The "jurisdictional inquiry" [*26]  regarding fraudulent joinder should not be "conflate[d]" with the standard for failure to state a claim. Grancare, 889 F.3d at 549; see also Padilla v. AT&T Corp., 697 F. Supp. 2d 1156, 1159 (C.D. Cal. 2009) ("[A] defendant seeking removal based on an alleged fraudulent joinder must do more than show that the complaint at the time of removal fails to state a claim against the non-diverse defendant."). The "standard is similar to the 'wholly insubstantial and frivolous' standard for dismissing claims under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of federal question jurisdiction." Grancare, 889 F.3d at 549 (citation omitted).
"Remand must be granted unless the defendant shows that the plaintiff would not be afforded leave to amend his complaint to cure the purported deficiency." Padilla, 697 F. Supp. 2d at 1159 (internal quotations and brackets omitted). Thus, Defendants have the "burden of establishing that Plaintiff is incapable of amending his complaint to state a valid IIED [or other] claim." Rangel v. Bridgestone Retail Operations, LLC, 200 F. Supp. 3d 1024, 1034 (C.D. Cal. 2016).
B. Application
1. Whether There is Diversity of Citizenship on the Face of the Complaint
It is undisputed that Plaintiff and Anderson are both citizens of California. A single non-diverse defendant precludes diversity jurisdiction. Accordingly, there is not complete diversity of citizenship on the face of the Complaint. However, there would be complete diversity if the [*27]  citizenship of Anderson were disregarded because it is undisputed that neither Continental nor CNA Financial is a citizen of California.
2. Whether the Citizenship of Anderson Should Be Disregarded
a) IIED Claim Against Anderson
(1) Specific Legal Standards
"The elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct." Light v. Cal. Dep't of Parks & Recreation, 14 Cal. App. 5th 75, 101, 221 Cal. Rptr. 3d 668 (2017) (internal quotations removed). "Conduct to be outrageous must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community." Id. "A simple pleading of personnel management activity is insufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, even if improper motivation is alleged." Janken v. GM Hughes Elecs., 46 Cal. App. 4th 55, 80, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996). However, a plaintiff "may pursue a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress in the employment context where the conduct at issue violates FEHA and also satisfies the elements of the" tort. [*28]  Light, 14 Cal. App. 5th at 101.
Ordinarily, an employee's "claims for intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress are preempted by the exclusivity provisions of the workers' compensation law." Livitsanos v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. 4th 744, 747, 7 Cal. Rptr. 2d 808, 828 P.2d 1195 (1992). However, "[e]ven where an injury is otherwise compensable under the workers' compensation system, a cause of action seeking damages based on the injury may nevertheless be allowable where the employer's conduct falls outside the compensation bargain." Light, 14 Cal. App. 5th at 96. Several California Courts of Appeal have found that "the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine is inapplicable to claims under the FEHA." E.g., M.F. v. Pac. Pearl Hotel Mgmt. LLC, 16 Cal. App. 5th 693, 700, 224 Cal. Rptr. 3d 542 (2017), review denied (Feb. 14, 2018); Light, 14 Cal. App. 5th at 101. Thus, an employee "may pursue a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress in the employment context where the conduct at issue violates FEHA and also satisfies the elements of the claim." Light, 14 Cal. App. 5th at 101. Although there is not unanimous agreement among the California Courts of Appeal on this issue, see Yau v. Santa Margarita Ford, Inc., 229 Cal. App. 4th 144, 161 (2014), a court "must resolve all material ambiguities in state law in plaintiff's favor" when presented with the question whether a defendant has been fraudulently joined. Macey, 220 F. Supp. 2d at 1117.
(2) Application
Plaintiff argues that Anderson treated him unfairly since January 2015, by failing to accommodate his [*29]  disability and criticizing him for his disability-related performance issues for the next 17 months. Plaintiff's Jurisdiction Brief, Dkt. 88 at 5. He contends that CNA's "phobia" of Plaintiff's disability contributed to Defendants' determinations first to "force[]" Plaintiff to take a leave of absence and then to terminate him "based on an obviously concocted" RIF that eliminated only Plaintiff's position. Id.; see also id. at 8 (these three actions were "extreme and outrageous"). He further argues that Defendants' stated reason for his termination demonstrates direct evidence of discrimination and that the termination was pretextual.
The evidence supporting Plaintiff's position regarding pretext includes: (i) Plaintiff was terminated as part of a "RIF of one"; (ii) Defendants, including Anderson, were not honest about the reasons for Plaintiff's termination, and intentionally obscured material issues including the basis for and effective date of the termination; (iii) Plaintiff had a positive work history; (iv) Anderson and others made "countless remarks . . . that expose a fear of the unknown"; and (v) the timing of the RIF was suspect. Id. at 8-10.
Defendants present three arguments regarding the IIED [*30]  claim against Anderson. First, there is no evidence of outrageous conduct by Anderson because there is no "conduct by Anderson intending to injure [Plaintiff]" or "actual evidence of disability and/or age harassment by Anderson." Defendants' Jurisdiction Brief, Dkt. 87 at 11. Second, all of Anderson's actions constitute personnel management activities that "may not be the factual basis for an IIED claim." Id. at 11-12. Third, Plaintiff's claim is preempted by the Workers' Compensation Act because it arises solely from Plaintiff's termination. Id. at 12-13. Defendants also argue that any effort by Plaintiff to amend the Complaint on this claim would be futile because the law on these issues is well-established. Id. at 13.
Neither the allegations nor the evidence shows a non-fanciful possibility that Plaintiff could recover against Anderson for IIED. The "essential element . . . of outrageous conduct beyond the bounds of human decency" is absent where all that has been included in a complaint is "[a] simple pleading of personnel management activity." Janken, 46 Cal. App. 4th at 80. Here, there are no allegations that show or imply actions that meet this high, shocks-the-conscience standard for an IIED claim. For example, the argument regarding CNA's [*31]  "phobia" of Plaintiff's disability is that Anderson made statements to individuals other than Plaintiff expressing concern that Plaintiff's problems with memory would affect his ability to represent clients competently. See, e.g., Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 20, Dkt. 73-28 at 3 (concerns about whether Plaintiff's memory issues pose problems under California Rules of Professional Conduct); Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit J, Dkt. 55-4 at 58 (concern with reducing Plaintiff's caseload was based on the possibility that "the cost to the insureds would go up if it took [Plaintiff] more time than an attorney of his job description to complete the same task"). Those concerns reflect personnel management activities that arise from Anderson's position as a supervisor acting to ensure that those he managed provided adequate services to clients. Moreover, these stated concerns have not been shown to have any causal relationship to Plaintiff's emotional distress. Similarly, the contention that Anderson "concoct[ed]" a RIF does not rise above the type of personnel management decision that is properly the subject of antidiscrimination law, rather than the tort of IIED.
Plaintiff's reliance on the [*32]  evidence he has collected regarding a pretextual basis for his termination shows that there is nothing beyond a standard discrimination claim to support the IIED claim. Compared to an action under FEHA, IIED is "a substantively different claim, aimed at a different wrong, and protects a different personal interest." Light, 14 Cal. App. 5th at 101 n. 10. Here, the relevant discrimination claim is based largely on circumstantial evidence as to the alleged impermissible motive for Plaintiff's termination. This claim differs substantially from one for IIED. Although the evidence identified by Plaintiff may permit a factfinder to "conclude [Anderson] acted improperly, and likely contributed to the [employer's] violation of FEHA[] . . . , [his] actions are common . . . supervisory actions" even if they were "ultimately misguided." See id. at 102 (granting summary judgment as to claim against supervisor whose actions were not sufficiently extreme, and finding triable issues as to a different individual for which there was evidence that "she ostracized [the plaintiff] in the workplace, encouraged [the plaintiff] to lie to investigators, pursued [the plaintiff] at home and in the office to determine whether [the plaintiff] did so, and [*33]  verbally and physically attacked [the plaintiff] after [the plaintiff] disobeyed").5
b) Harassment Claim Against Anderson
(1) Specific Legal Standards
To establish a claim for harassment under FEHA, a plaintiff must demonstrate each of the following: (i) he is "a member of a protected group"; (ii) he was "subjected to harassment because []he belonged to this group"; and (iii) the alleged harassment "was so severe that it created a hostile work environment." Lawler v. Montblanc N.A., LLC, 704 F.3d 1235, 1244 (9th Cir. 2013). Harassment under FEHA "focuses on situations in which the social environment of the workplace becomes intolerable because the harassment (whether verbal, physical, or visual) communicates an offensive message to the harassed employee." Roby v. McKesson Corp., 47 Cal. 4th 686, 706, 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 773, 219 P.3d 749 (2009) (emphasis omitted). Liability for harassment may arise when the plaintiff's workplace is "permeated" with conduct directed at that person that is "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Lyle v. Warner Bros. Television Prods., 38 Cal. 4th 264, 279, 42 Cal. Rptr. 3d 2, 132 P.3d 211 (2006) (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). However, FEHA is not a "civility code," and it does not bar conduct just because it may be offensive. Id. at 295. Additionally, there must be a "concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated, routine or a generalized nature." [*34]  Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 121, 130-31, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 132, 980 P.2d 846 (1999); see also Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal. 4th 1035, 1043, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009) (unless the harassing conduct is "severe in the extreme," there is no recovery "for harassment that is occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial.") (quoting Lyle, 38 Cal. 4th at 283-84).6
(2) Application
Plaintiff argues that, by unfairly treating Plaintiff and criticizing him for shortcomings that were due to his disability, Anderson participated in harassing behavior that was severe enough to show a hostile work environment. Plaintiff's Jurisdiction Brief, Dkt. 88 at 5-6. Defendants argue that Plaintiff's deposition testimony establishes that he had a positive working relationship with Anderson, and did not identify negative comments by Anderson about Plaintiff's disability while he was employed. Defendants' Jurisdiction Brief, Dkt. 87 at 7-8.7
Neither the allegations nor the evidence shows a non-fanciful possibility that Plaintiff could prove he was harassed by Anderson. None of the material relied upon by Plaintiff shows that the "social environment of the workplace" was "intolerable" or a "hostile work environment" for Plaintiff. See Roby, 47 Cal. 4th at 706 (emphasis omitted); Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1244. To the contrary, Plaintiff testified that, while he was employed, Anderson never said or did "anything that suggested to [Plaintiff] that he [*35]  didn't like [Plaintiff]" and that the two had a "good" working relationship. Carrico Depo. at 66:14-67:5. These statements are not undermined by Plaintiff's position that Anderson "criticized [Plaintiff] for his disability related shortcomings." See Plaintiff's Jurisdiction Brief, Dkt. 88 at 5. Even assuming that those criticisms were inappropriate, there is no allegation or evidence that, at the time such statements were made, Plaintiff felt that there had been an intolerable and severe level of offensive conduct.
Anderson's conversations with Plaintiff concerned aspects of Plaintiff's job performance that were relevant to his ability to serve clients and the interests of his employer. To be sure, for the reasons stated below, the evidence submitted presents triable issues as to impermissible discrimination. However, the distinction between discrimination and harassment is important, and the distinguishing features of harassment are absent from the allegations and evidence here. See Janken, 46 Cal. App. 4th at 64-65 ("necessary personnel management actions such as hiring and firing . . . may retrospectively be found discriminatory if based on improper motives, but in that event the remedies provided by the FEHA are [*36]  those for discrimination, not harassment"). That distinction from a discrimination claim is significant where, as here, it affects the subject matter jurisdiction of a federal court. See Wexler v. Jensen Pharm., Inc., No. 15-cv-03518-ABA-JW, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142674, 2015 WL 6159101, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 20, 2015) (harassment claim fraudulently joined where there is no plausible inference that statements made had "'a secondary effect of communicating a hostile message'") (quoting Roby, 47 Cal. 4th at 709).8
* * *
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff has not shown that, at the time of removal, there was a possibility of recovery against Anderson for either of the two claims advanced against him: IIED and harassment. Anderson is therefore DISMISSED as a fraudulently joined defendant. Because the remaining defendants are of diverse citizenship, the OSC is DISCHARGED.

IV. Summary Judgment
A. Legal Standards
A motion for summary judgment will be granted where the pleadings, "depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials" show that there is "no genuine dispute as to any material [*37]  fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), (c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden to show the basis for its motion and to identify those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Where the moving party will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the movant must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party. See id. at 323-24. Where the nonmoving party will have the burden of proof on an issue, however, the movant need only demonstrate that there is an absence of evidence to support the claims of the nonmoving party. See id. at 324. If the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must set forth "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
"By its very terms, th[e] [summary judgment] standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Id. at 247-48. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of [*38]  the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. at 248. Moreover, "summary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is 'genuine,' that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id.
Only facts supported by admissible evidence may be considered in connection with a motion for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In particular, "[a]n affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion [for summary judgment] must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Id. However, in considering such a motion, a court is not to make any credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. See Alameda Books, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 631 F.3d 1031, 1042-43 (9th Cir. 2011) ("The credibility of witnesses is almost categorically a trial issue"). All inferences are to be drawn in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 631 (9th Cir. 1987). However, conclusory, speculative testimony in declarations or other evidentiary materials is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary [*39]  judgment. See Thornhill Publ'g Co. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).
"A plaintiff alleging employment discrimination need produce very little evidence in order to overcome an employer's motion for summary judgment." Davis v. Team Elec. Co., 520 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). "In evaluating motions for summary judgment in the context of employment discrimination, [the Ninth Circuit] ha[s] emphasized the importance of zealously guarding an employee's right to a full trial, since discrimination claims are frequently difficult to prove without a full airing of the evidence and an opportunity to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses." Id.
B. Application
1. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation and Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process under the FEHA
a) Legal Standards
(1) Reasonable Accommodation
"The FEHA imposes on the employer the obligation to make reasonable accommodation." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1003, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). It provides, in relevant part:
It is an unlawful employment practice, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification, or, except where based upon applicable security regulations established by the United States or the State of California:
. . .
(m) For an employer . . . to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability [*40]  of an applicant or employee.
Cal. Gov't Code § 12940.
"To establish a reasonable accommodation claim, an employee must show that (1) the employee has a disability under FEHA, (2) the employee is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability." Aparicio v. Comcast, Inc., 274 F. Supp. 3d 1014, 1029 (N.D. Cal. 2017). "A reasonable accommodation is 'a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired.'" Id. (quoting Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 974, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008)). However, "[a]n employer is not required to make an accommodation 'that is demonstrated by the employer . . . to produce undue hardship to its operation.'" Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1003 (citation omitted).
(2) Interactive Process
"The FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer 'to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition.'" Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1003 (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n)). "Section 12940, subdivision (n) imposes separate duties on the employer to engage in the 'interactive process' and to make 'reasonable accommodations.'" Id. (internal [*41]  quotations and citations omitted).
"The interactive process imposes burdens on both the employer and employee. The employee must initiate the process unless the disability and resulting limitations are obvious." Id. at 1013. "Once the interactive process is initiated, the employer's obligation to engage in the process in good faith is continuous." Id. "The employer's obligation to engage in the interactive process extends beyond the first attempt at accommodation and continues when the employee asks for a different accommodation or where the employer is aware that the initial accommodation is failing and further accommodation is needed. This rule fosters the framework of cooperative problem-solving contemplated by the ADA, by encouraging employers to seek to find accommodations that really work." Id. (citation omitted).
"Both employer and employee have the obligation 'to keep communications open' and neither has 'a right to obstruct the process.'" Id. at 1014 (citation omitted). "Each party must participate in good faith, undertake reasonable efforts to communicate its concerns, and make available to the other information which is available, or more accessible, to one party. Liability hinges on the objective [*42]  circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith." Id.
(3) Statute of Limitations and Continuing Violation Doctrine
A cause of action for a violation of the FEHA must first be brought through an administrative complaint filed with the DFEH. Accardi v. Superior Court, 17 Cal. App. 4th 341, 349, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 292 (1993), as modified on denial of reh'g (Aug. 20, 1993); overruled on other grounds by Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001). There is a one year statute of limitations from the "date upon which the alleged unlawful practice or refusal to cooperate occurred" for a plaintiff to file a complaint with the DFEH. Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(e).
If a complaint is not filed within the statute of limitations, those claims are then barred. Hobson v. Raychem Corp., 73 Cal. App. 4th 614, 631, 86 Cal. Rptr. 2d 497 (1999) ("[I]f an employee fails to file an administrative charge specifically identifying the alleged discrimination, and within one year of its occurrence, the subsequent lawsuit will be barred."), disapproved of on other grounds, Colmenares v. Braemar Country Club, Inc., 29 Cal. 4th 1019, 130 Cal. Rptr. 2d 662, 63 P.3d 220 (2003). However, under the continuing violation doctrine, "an employer is liable for actions that take place outside the limitations period if these actions are sufficiently linked to unlawful conduct that occurred within the limitations period." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1056, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). "[T]he [*43]  FEHA statute of limitations begins to run when an alleged adverse employment action acquires some degree of permanence or finality," but not sooner. Id. at 1059. The continuing violation doctrine is premised on the principle that "the employer that creates or permits a persistent pattern of harassment or failure to reasonably accommodate that makes its working conditions unfavorable to the employee . . . cannot complain of delay when the employee retains employment in hopes that informal conciliation will succeed." Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 822, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001).
Courts consider the following factors in assessing whether the continuing violation doctrine applies:
whether "the employer's actions were (1) sufficiently similar in kind—recognizing, as this case illustrates, that similar kinds of unlawful employer conduct, such as acts of harassment or failures to reasonably accommodate disability, may take a number of different forms . . . ; (2) have occurred with reasonable frequency; (3) and have not acquired a degree of permanence."
L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th at 1059 (quoting Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 823). "'[P]ermanence' . . . should properly be understood to mean the following: that an employer's statements and actions make clear to a reasonable employee that any further efforts at informal [*44]  conciliation to obtain reasonable accommodation or end harassment will be futile." Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 823.
b) Application
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation and interactive process claims fail because Plaintiff's request was to reduce or eliminate the reporting requirement, which was an essential function of his job. Defendants argue they reasonably accommodated Plaintiff by providing him with a leave of absence. They argue that the interactive process claim fails for two principal reasons: (i) it is derivative; and (ii) Plaintiff is the one responsible for any communications breakdown due to his attempt to rescind his accommodations request, and his refusal to provide a more detailed note from his physician as to his ability to perform his job.
Plaintiff responds that Defendants' "failure to engage/accommodate" included their failure to offer an accommodation from the time of his accident through June 2016, "when Anderson finally referred [Plaintiff] to Leave Administration." Opposition, Dkt. 73 at 23. After that time, the failure continued because Defendants' position that Plaintiff's full-time presence at his position is an essential job function is not supported by sufficient evidence. [*45]  Id. at 23-24. Plaintiff also contends that he was presented with an "illegal requirement" that he be "100 percent healthy" before he could return to work. Id. at 24.
Defendants reply that Plaintiff has made an "about face" concerning the nature of his claim through his opposition brief. Reply, Dkt. 78 at 6. They claim that it focuses on "the Company's inability to reduce his caseload" instead of their denial of his request to reduce his reporting requirement. Id. As to the argument raised in opposition, Defendants reply that Plaintiff testified that this was not the basis for his claim and that his regular attendance was an essential job function. Id. at 6-7. Because it is undisputed that a leave of absence was provided in March 2017, there is no claim here "because an employer is not required to choose the employee's preferred accommodation." Id. at 7.
(1) Request for Reduction in Caseload in February 2017
A triable issue is presented with respect to whether Defendants failed to provide Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation, and failed to engage in the interactive process. It arises from the events in or around February 2017, when Defendants allegedly denied Plaintiff's request for a reduction in his caseload. Defendants' [*46]  primary argument in support of the MSJ is that Plaintiff's only request was "to reduce or eliminate the reporting requirement" for Plaintiff's position. See id. at 6. However, that is not the basis on which Plaintiff has shown a triable issue. Indeed, he has abandoned the position that Defendants should have accommodated him by modifying the requirement that he complete certain reports in a timely manner. See Opposition, Dkt. 73 at 23 n.1. Notwithstanding that concession, Plaintiff has presented a triable issue based on his position that Defendants should not have rejected his request for a 25% reduction in his caseload.
Plaintiff testified that Finzer informed him that, in order to obtain an accommodation, he would have to have a physician fill out a form that was "very specific about what it is that he or she wants accommodated, just for example, a reduction in hours or reduction in case load, a percentage." Carrico Depo. at 96:21-24. He informed her that he would "concede" to present this form to a physician. This was because, although he did not want a reduction in hours due to concerns that this would place him further behind in his work, he would benefit from a reduction in his caseload. [*47]  Id. at 96:25-97:4. His physician, Dr. Zackler, then completed the form in which he recommended a 25% reduction in Plaintiff's caseload. Plaintiff testified that, on February 14, 2017, Finzer informed him that this request for a 25% reduction in caseload is something that "can't" be accommodated "at all." Carrico Depo. at 73:10.
A fact issue is presented as to whether Defendants refused to accommodate a reasonable reduction in Plaintiff's caseload, and to engage in further communications with him about that request. To be sure, Plaintiff's response to the denial was to ask Finzer about alternatives that included "revok[ing] the request" or "a short reprieve on [his] reporting" requirement. Carrico Depo. at 73:10-20; Carrico Decl., Dkt. 73-3 ¶ 41. Therefore, there is some evidence on which Defendants may seek to rely at trial in support of their position that, based on Plaintiff's response, they had no further obligation to reconsider their position regarding a reduction in caseload. However, a reasonable jury might infer that Defendants made a final determination to deny Plaintiff's request for a reduction in caseload -- which is the only request that was specifically included in the [*48]  note from his physician, see Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit B-2, Dkt. 55-3 at 219 -- when they should have made the accommodation and/or continued to discuss alternatives with Plaintiff. That Plaintiff responded to the February 14 denial by saying "fine, I'll just revoke the request," Carrico Depo. at 73:10-12, could support a determination by a jury that Defendants should have responded with further attempts to accommodate. Plaintiff's testimony is that, instead of doing so, Finzer offered him the limited options of either obtaining a physician's note that "says that you're a hundred percent fine" or taking a leave of absence. See Carrico Depo. at 73:13-15.
Defendants argue that "an employer is not required to choose the employee's preferred accommodation." Reply, Dkt. 78 at 7 (citing Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226-28, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999)). However, an employer may not require that the employee take a leave of absence where some other reasonable accommodation may be available. See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11068(c) ("When an employee can work with a reasonable accommodation other than a leave of absence, an employer may not require that the employee take a leave of absence."); see also Wallace v. County of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 134, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (2016). Here, a fact issue is presented as to whether, by not presenting any alternatives to [*49]  a leave of absence or a note stating that Plaintiff could work without an accommodation, Defendants effectively required Plaintiff to take a leave of absence.
Defendants also argue that reducing Plaintiff's caseload would have interfered with an essential job function, because "regular attendance for a demanding job like a litigation lawyer (i.e., a full-time job) is an essential job function." Reply, Dkt. 78 at 6 (citing Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1238 (9th Cir. 2012)). This argument is unpersuasive. Plaintiff arguably did not make a request for a temporary reduction in his caseload to change the full-time nature of his position. Instead, the evidence could support a finding that he did so as an interim measure to permit him, while still working full-time, to catch up on those case management tasks on which he had not been timely due to his disability. See Carrico Depo. 73:6-8 (referring to doctor's suggestion as "a temporary reduction, 25 percent, so you get caught up and life goes on"). Thus, even if it were necessary for Plaintiff to be available and to work full-time, the "essential function" at issue is the number of cases that he had to manage, not the number of hours during which Plaintiff would report to work and be available [*50]  to respond to the needs that arose in those cases. As to the imposition of a caseload requirement, Defendants have not established as a matter of law that a temporary reduction in caseload was irreconcilable with Plaintiff's job responsibilities. Instead, they have focused on the importance of Plaintiff working full-time and completing his reports in a timely manner. See DSF ¶ 39.
A factfinder could conclude that it was expected that, as a consequence of employing Plaintiff as a full-time litigation attorney, Defendants should have been able to rely on Plaintiff to handle all cases assigned to him. However, the evidence does not preclude, as a matter of law, the possibility that a temporary reduction in his caseload would have been reasonable. For similar reasons, it does not establish per se that the nature of litigation work is such that a reduction in caseload does not guarantee a reduction in the amount of work necessary at any particular time. It is sufficient that there is a reasonable inference that an overall reduction in caseload could reasonably have been expected to have reduced the amount of work needed at any given time. This could have provided a path for a litigation [*51]  attorney to catch up on tasks related to the cases being managed.
For the foregoing reasons, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants failed to provide Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation and failed to engage in the interactive process in or around February 2017.
(2) Alleged Failures Prior to February 2017
Plaintiff also argues that the February 2017 failure to accommodate was a continuation of a failure that began in 2014, after Defendants became aware of his disability. Opposition, Dkt. 73 at 23. In response, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot "reach-back to May 2014" because the claim is time-barred to the extent it relies on activity that occurred more than one year before Plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies in late 2017. Reply, Dkt. 78 at 7. Plaintiff was permitted to file a sur-reply as to this issue. Dkt. 100. Through it, he argues that the statute of limitations does not bar his claim as to the earlier conduct because there is a triable issue under the continuing violation doctrine. See Sur-Reply, Dkt. 102.
As an initial matter, it is not necessary to reach these issues because the events of February 2017 create a triable issue as to Plaintiff's [*52]  reasonable accommodation and interactive process claims. To the extent the parties disagreement distills to what evidence, if any, as to the earlier events may be introduced at trial in support of the claim, that issue can be presented through the filing of an appropriate motion in limine. However, to the extent Defendants presently seek a ruling that Plaintiff is barred from relying on any evidence about his interactions with Defendants more than one year before the exhaustion of his administrative remedies, fact issues are presented about whether there was a continuing violation that extended to February 2017.
The evidence offered in support of Plaintiff's position as to a potential claim that began earlier than February 2017 includes that Anderson had actual and/or constructive notice of Plaintiff's disability as of late 2014 or early 2015. See Carrico Decl. ¶ 20.9 A fact issue is presented as to whether Anderson should have assisted Plaintiff with obtaining an accommodation sooner than mid-2016, when he ultimately recommended that Plaintiff contact Leave Administration to request an accommodation.
This conclusion recognizes that when Plaintiff did contact Finzer in 2016, he [*53]  declined to complete an accommodation request form. In certain cases, this could present a basis to bar an interactive process claim. See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1014 ("responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith"). However, there is a fact issue as to whether Defendants should have done more to determine what accommodations could have been made available to Plaintiff and to continue to communicate with him. There is also a fact issue with respect to whether Anderson, Finzer, or another individual should have continued to interact with Plaintiff after he did not complete the form, given that each knew at that time that some accommodation might have been warranted.
For these reasons, it has not been shown that, as a matter of law, Defendants' "statements and actions" in mid-2016 would "make clear to a reasonable employee that any further efforts at informal conciliation to obtain reasonable accommodation" would be "futile." Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 823. Thus, Plaintiff's claim did not necessarily achieve "permanence" as of that time, which is the sole argument Defendants present against application of the continuing violation doctrine here. See Reply, Dkt. 78 at 7.10
* * *
For the foregoing reasons, [*54]  the MSJ is DENIED as to Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation and interactive process claims.
2. FEHA Claims for Disability Discrimination and Retaliation and Claim for Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy Wrongful Termination Claims
a) Legal Standards
(1) Disability Discrimination under FEHA
The "FEHA prohibits an employer from, among other things, discharging a person from employment because of a medical condition or physical disability." Soria v. Univision Radio Los Angeles, Inc., 5 Cal. App. 5th 570, 583, 210 Cal. Rptr. 3d 59 (2016), review denied (Mar. 1, 2017) (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)). In the context of the FEHA, the term "physical disability"
includes, but is not limited to . . . [h]aving any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss that does both of the following:
(A) Affects one or more of the following body systems: neurological, immunological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory, including speech organs, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine.
(B) Limits a major life activity.
Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(m)(1).
"Because of the similarity between state and federal employment discrimination laws, California courts look to pertinent federal precedent when applying [California's] own statutes. In [*55]  particular, California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination . . . based on a theory of disparate treatment." Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (internal citations omitted). This test proceeds as follows:
First, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. The employer then must offer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision. Finally, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the employer's proffered reason was pretextual.
Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 236, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997) (internal citations omitted); see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). "[C]ourts and practitioners should not automatically apply principles related to the McDonnell Douglas test to disability discrimination cases. Rather, they should examine the critical threshold issue" of whether the case involves "direct evidence of the role of the employee's actual or perceived disability in the employer's decision to implement an adverse employment action." Wallace, 245 Cal. App. 4th at 123-31. Where the dispute "focus[es] on whether the employee was able to perform essential job functions, whether there were reasonable accommodations that would have allowed the employee to perform those functions, and [*56]  whether a reasonable accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship on the employer," the three-stage framework may not apply. See id. at 123.
When McDonnell Douglas applies, at the first step, "[a] prima facie case for discrimination on grounds of physical disability under the FEHA requires plaintiff to show: (1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and, (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability." Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 886, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007) (internal quotations omitted). "[C]onduct resulting from a disability is considered to be part of the disability, rather than a separate basis for termination." Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1139-40 (9th Cir. 2001).
At step two of the McDonnell Douglas framework, "[t]o demonstrate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate [a plaintiff], [the employer] 'must show that the procedure by which [the plaintiff] was terminated was validly and fairly devised and administered to serve a legitimate business purpose.'" Dep't of Fair Emp't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745-46 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 224, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999)).
In response, "a plaintiff can prove pretext in two ways: (1) indirectly, by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is 'unworthy of credence' because it is internally inconsistent or otherwise not believable, or (2) directly, [*57]  by showing that unlawful discrimination more likely motivated the employer." Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trs., 225 F.3d 1115, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000). "These two approaches are not exclusive; a combination of the two kinds of evidence may in some cases serve to establish pretext so as to make summary judgment improper." Id. "Furthermore, in making such showing, [a plaintiff] does not necessarily have to introduce additional, independent evidence of discrimination." Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1094(9th Cir. 2001). However, "[a]n employee in this situation cannot simply show the employer's decision was wrong, mistaken, or unwise." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746.
(2) Retaliation under FEHA
"The FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer 'to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part.'" Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1003 (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h)). To state a claim for retaliation, "a plaintiff must show (1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link between the two." Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir. 2000). "Essential to a causal link is evidence that the employer was aware that the plaintiff had engaged in the protected activity." Cohen v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 686 F.2d 793, 796 (9th Cir. 1982). "This requires evidence from which a reasonable factfinder [*58]  can infer the decision maker (or at least one of them if more than one) in the challenged action was aware of the protected activity." Pinder v. Emp't Dev. Dep't, 227 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1147 (E.D. Cal. 2017); see also Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 73-74, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000).
Until recently, "a request for an accommodation, without more, was insufficient to constitute 'protected activity' under [the FEHA], and such activity thus could not support a claim for retaliation." Moore v. Regents of Univ. of California, 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 247, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016); see also Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 381, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015) (affirming summary judgment for employer on a FEHA retaliation claim because "protected activity does not include a mere request for reasonable accommodation"). In 2015, the Legislature amended the FEHA "to provide protection against retaliation when an individual makes a request for reasonable accommodation under these sections." Moore, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 245 (quoting Assem. Bill 987, § 1(d)). The amended provisions took effect on January 1, 2016 and "operate[] prospectively." Id. at 245-47.
(3) Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
"Under California law, employment is at-will unless the parties contract otherwise. California courts, however, have carved out a specific exception to this general rule: an employer will be liable if it terminates an employee in violation of public policy." Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1137 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal citation omitted). Thus, "[t]he elements for this tort are (1) the existence [*59]  of a public policy and (2) a nexus between the public policy and an employee's termination." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 749.
The California Supreme Court has "conclude[d] that disability discrimination can form the basis of a common law wrongful discharge claim." City of Moorpark v. Superior Court, 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1161, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752, 763 (1998); see also Cal. Gov't Code § 12920 ("It is hereby declared as the public policy of this state that it is necessary to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination or abridgment on account of . . . physical disability.").
b) The Positions of the Parties
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's termination-related claims under FEHA, and his related claim for termination in violation of public policy, fail because he was terminated as part of a reduction in force, for which there was a legitimate business reason. MSJ, Dkt. 55-1 at 21-22. They argue that the outcome does not change as a result of the evidence that Plaintiff was on a leave of absence at the time of his termination; Plaintiff did not have "job protection reinstatement rights" where, as here, "his position is eliminated." Id. at 22.
Plaintiff responds that testimony and documents reflecting statements by, among others, Anderson, show "direct evidence" of discrimination [*60]  because they include "discuss[ions] [of] unfounded assumptions/prejudices re cognitive impairments." Opposition to MSJ, Dkt. 73 at 25. Even if there were not such direct evidence, Plaintiff argues that his claim succeeds under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework.
First, he claims that he has made a prima facie showing that he engaged in protected activity by taking a medical leave, requesting an accommodation, and refusing to participate in the unethical activity of asking his doctor to change his diagnosis. He also argues that he can show that his leave was a factor in the decision to terminate him. Second, he contends that Defendants cannot prove a legitimate business reason for terminating him. Third, even if Defendants could identify such a reason, the evidence shows that the termination was pretextual, for many reasons: (i) the "reduction in force" eliminated only one position (Plaintiff's); (ii) there is proof that Anderson, Hamilton, and Fang have provided false reasons, including through perjury by Anderson; (iii) Defendants have not presented consistent evidence as to the true decisionmakers for the RIF and its scope and have attempted to use it as a "concoct[ed] [*61]  . . . 'stated rationale'"; (iv) Plaintiff had a positive work history; (v) decisionmakers made remarks "that expose a fear of the unknown re: Carrico's disability"; (vi) there is insufficient corroborating documentation about the basis for Defendants' determination that a reduction in force was warranted based on a reduction in the workload for Plaintiff's position; (vii) the "skills assessment" used to justify the selection of Plaintiff as the target of the RIF is suspect because it "was 100% discretionary and inherently subjective"; (viii) the timing of the termination is suspect; (ix) Defendants deviated from their normal policies and practices by failing to accommodate Plaintiff previously; (x) Defendants failed adequately to investigate and examine the qualifications of Plaintiff compared to those of Newman, who was considered for the RIF; and (xi) there is a corporate culture of bias, supported by "me too" evidence.
In reply, Defendants contend that Plaintiff has failed to adequately dispute that there was a decline in lower-level tort cases, which is what Plaintiff handled. From this they contend that they have provided what was the legitimate business reason for his termination. [*62]  As to Plaintiff's claim that there is circumstantial evidence of pretext, Defendants argue that Anderson did not give false testimony, that inconsistent recollections about the process of deciding to terminate Plaintiff do not show pretext, and the actual reason -- a reduction in force -- has remained consistent.
c) Discussion
As to the first step under the McDonnell Douglas framework, Defendants do not contest that Plaintiff is disabled and otherwise qualified to do his job. The parties do not dispute that termination was an adverse employment action, but they dispute whether Plaintiff's termination was due to his disability. This issue requires an assessment of the next steps of the framework. As to the second step, Defendants have presented the RIF as the stated business reason for which Plaintiff was terminated. Plaintiff does not dispute that a RIF could, in some cases, present a legitimate business reason to terminate a position. However, he contends that there is a triable issue as to whether the stated reason was pretextual in this case. Therefore, pretext is the core disputed issue.11
A reasonable jury could determine that Plaintiff's disability was a substantial [*63]  motivating factor for Defendants' decision to terminate Plaintiff's position. Thus, it could find that Defendants first determined they wanted to terminate Plaintiff based on his disability-related leave and/or his underlying disability, and then adopted the RIF in order to obfuscate the actual basis for their termination decision. This determination does not overlook the evidence that there was in fact a modest decline in tort files that could support a RIF. However, a reasonable jury could conclude that this was not the actual reason for Plaintiff's termination, for several reasons.
First, the overlap in time and personnel between discussions of Plaintiff's leave and the idea to conduct a RIF. There is no evidence that those responsible for making the RIF decision assessed their business needs separately from the topics of discussion that may have prompted their RIF consideration: whether and when Plaintiff would return from leave. The evidence could support an inference that the RIF was planned and implemented as an excuse to solve that problem, rather than as a policy adopted based on the stated reason of a decline in tort files. For example, Fang recalls the RIF being addressed [*64]  in an August 30, 2017 meeting whose purpose was to discuss Plaintiff's leave. See Fang Depo. at 102:6-15; Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 38, Dkt. 73-46 (scheduling meeting). Fang's September 7, 2017 handwritten note also implies that a meeting whose purpose was to follow up about Plaintiff's leave (with his name in the title of the note) was one through which business needs regarding torts litigators were discussed, and it was also determined that Plaintiff would promptly be "[told]" something in advance of his "Oct[ober] return" to work. See Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 47. A reasonable jury might infer that this reflects that at that meeting, relevant personnel already had decided that Plaintiff would be told that his job had been terminated, before the relevant evaluation had been completed.
Both the August 30 and September 7 meetings predate any documentation of the need for a RIF and the conclusion that Plaintiff's position would be the only one eliminated. It was not until after those meetings that Fang provided a "skills assessment" template for Anderson and Hamilton to complete. It was after that template was sent on September 10, 2017, that Anderson wrote emails, on September [*65]  12, 2017, describing the modest decline in tort cases among band 260 attorneys, before completing the RIF Memo the following day. That Fang's September 7 notes refer to such a decline provides further support for the possibility that the RIF was devised as a solution to the question of how to address Plaintiff's leave, rather than about how to address a decline in tort files. See Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 47.
Second, several features of the RIF decision could support an inference that the outcome of the RIF analysis was predetermined. These include that only two individuals (Plaintiff and Newman) were considered, with the goal of eliminating one of their positions. Cf. Bellaver v. Quanex Corp./Nichols-Homeshield, 200 F.3d 485, 494 (7th Cir. 2000) ("RIFs typically involve the layoff of many employees at once, and employers will not be allowed cynically to avoid liability by terming a decision to fire an employee with a unique job description as a 'RIF' when the decision in fact was nothing more than a decision to fire that particular employee.").12
Also relevant is that the relative performance evaluation of the two individuals was based on a "skills assessment" that may have been completed with a determined goal (to terminate Plaintiff) that [*66]  had been in mind from the outset. For example, the document was completed by Anderson and Hamilton after it was provided to them by Fang as a follow-up to a series of meetings about Plaintiff's leave. Additionally, the "skills assessment" that supported the RIF determination was a one-page set of numerical ratings in subjective categories with no accompanying written documentation as to their basis. See RIF Memo, Dkt. 73-59 at 7-9. Plaintiff was rated lower than Newman by a similar margin in each of the subjective categories. However, there was no documentation of, or reference to prior performance evaluations. Nor were any identified as to Newman, who had been hired approximately two months before the evaluation. This could support an inference of pretext. Cf. Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1136 ("Where termination decisions rely on subjective evaluations, careful analysis of possible impermissible motivations is warranted because such evaluations are particularly 'susceptible of abuse and more likely to mask pretext.'") (quoting Weldon v. Kraft, Inc., 896 F.2d 793, 798 (3d Cir. 1990)).
Third, there is evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff's failure to return from his disability leave was expressly considered as part of the decision to terminate [*67]  his employment. This includes a September 22, 2017 email from Fath to Plaintiff in which she states two reasons for his termination: (i) "you remain disabled past the STD period"; and (ii) "in evaluating business needs, we do not have an open role for you." Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 52, Dkt. 73-60. The second statement in that email can be consistent with a RIF. That is not clear as to the first one. That this first reason appears in a post-termination correspondence from a human resources employee could support an inference that the alleged RIF -- the sole basis for termination on which Defendants now rely -- was not actually the reason for Plaintiff's termination. That conclusion is also supported by statements made by Fath in post-termination emails regarding what should be reflected in Defendants' records as to why Plaintiff was terminated. See Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 56, Dkt. 73-64 at 2-3 (email from Fath stating that reason for termination coded into system had been initially input as "STD expired"); Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 53, Dkt. 73-61 at 5 (employee record run as of November 29, 2017 that reflects that the reason for Plaintiff's termination was "LVE," i.e. [*68] , that it was related to his leave of absence).
Finally, the evidence as to pretext is supported by the close proximity in time between Plaintiff's having extended his disability-based leave and the determination to terminate his position. Although "temporal proximity alone is not sufficient to raise a triable issue as to pretext," Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 353, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008), here that proximity supports the other evidence presented.
For the foregoing reasons, under the McDonnell Douglas framework, there is a genuine dispute as to whether Defendants' proffered reason for Plaintiff's termination represented their actual reason for eliminating his position. Therefore, the MSJ is DENIED as to the claims arising from Plaintiff's termination under FEHA (disability discrimination and retaliation), and the claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.13
3. Whistleblower Claim Under Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5
a) Legal Standards
Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5 is a whistleblower statute that proscribes retaliation based on an employee's disclosure of information regarding a violation of law (§ 1102.5(b)) or refusal to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of law (§ 1102.5(c)). A similar burden-shifting analysis applies here as the one that applies to Plaintiff's FEHA claims. See Morgan, 88 Cal. App. 4th at 68-69 [*69] .
b) Application
Plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendants terminated him in retaliation for the following actions: (i) reporting to colleagues that Finzer had instructed him to have his doctor change a diagnosis; and (ii) reporting to Anderson that he would not agree to appear at settlement conferences and state that he had authority to settle a case when he did not, see Carrico Decl. ¶ 35. Defendants respond that Plaintiff's belief that he was complaining about unlawful activity was unreasonable as a matter of law.
The sufficiency of Plaintiff's showing that his termination was pretextual precludes summary judgment as to his whistleblower claim. Just as a reasonable jury could conclude that the actual reason for Plaintiff's termination was his disability and/or request for an accommodation of that disability, it could also conclude that the actual reason was in retaliation for the conduct identified by Plaintiff. This does not mean that all of the evidence identified by Plaintiff would be admitted at trial. In particular, it is not clear that there is a sufficient link between Plaintiff's termination and his alleged refusal to appear in a particular capacity [*70]  at settlement conferences. See Carrico Decl. ¶ 35. However, there is sufficient admissible evidence to show a triable issue.
For the foregoing reasons, the MSJ is DENIED with respect to Plaintiff's whistleblower claim under Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5.
4. Age Discrimination
Defendants contend that Plaintiff's age discrimination claim fails as a matter of law because Plaintiff cannot show that his termination was a pretext for such discrimination. See Notice of Motion, Dkt. 55 at 3 (issue 5). Plaintiff has not addressed evidence of age-based discrimination in his opposition. A review of the admissible evidence presented does not show a basis for concluding that there is a triable issue as to age-based discrimination. Plaintiff's counsel submitted to this tentative opinion during the hearing on the MSJ. See Transcript of June 24, 2019 Hearing, Dkt. 96 at 9, 33. Therefore, the MSJ is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's age discrimination-based claims.
5. Harassment
Plaintiff's harassment claim against Anderson is addressed above with respect to the OSC. See Part III.B.2.b), supra. Plaintiff relies on the same evidence in opposition to summary judgment as he does in support of his position as to the absence of fraudulent joinder. [*71]  Compare Opposition to MSJ, Dkt. 73 at 31, with Plaintiff's Jurisdiction Brief, Dkt. 88 at 5. Because there is no non-fanciful possibility of a viable harassment claim based on those actions of Anderson, and no additional actions are attributed to the employer defendants in opposition to the MSJ, it follows from the determination on the OSC that the less exacting summary judgment standard (genuine issue of material fact rather than non-fanciful possibility of success as to the claim) must also be resolved in favor of the employer defendants. Therefore, the MSJ is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's harassment claim.
6. Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Retaliation, and Harassment
The parties agree that the viability of Plaintiff's "failure to prevent" claim is determined by that of the underlying substantive claims. Compare MSJ, Dkt. 55-1 at 26-27 (claim is derivative of others and fails), with Opposition, Dkt. 73 at 31 ("Because Carrico's claims [for discrimination, retaliation, and harassment] survive, so do his failure to prevent and public policy claims.").
Because there are triable issues as to discrimination and retaliation, the MSJ is DENIED as to the failure to prevent claim.
7. IIED and [*72]  Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention Claim
Plaintiff's IIED claim is addressed above with respect to the OSC. See Part III.B.2.a), supra. Plaintiff relies on the same evidence regarding actions by Anderson in opposing the MSJ and in response to the OSC. Compare Opposition to MSJ, Dkt. 73 at 33, with Plaintiff's Jurisdiction Brief, Dkt. 88 at 8. He also argues that "if any of [his] discrimination, harassment, or retaliation claims survive, his IIED claim does as well." Opposition to MSJ, Dkt. 73 at 33. These positions are unpersuasive. As stated above, there is no non-fanciful possibility of an IIED claim based on the allegations and evidence here. Therefore, the less exacting summary judgment standard must also be resolved in favor of the employer defendants. Plaintiff's position that this can in effect be treated as a derivative claim is also unpersuasive. See Light, 14 Cal. App. 5th at 101 n.10 (as compared to an action under FEHA, IIED is "a substantively different claim, aimed at a different wrong, and protects a different personal interest.").
Plaintiff's Complaint also includes a claim for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention. However, Plaintiff has not disputed that this claim is "premised on the [*73]  same intentional supervisor actions as the IIED claim." See MSJ, Dkt. 55-1 at 31 n.70; see also Opposition, Dkt. 73 at 33 (only argument against summary judgment is that "[t]he same [analysis] applies" to this claim as to the claim for IIED). Because there is no triable issue as to IIED, there is also no triable issue as to negligent hiring, supervision, and retention.
For the foregoing reasons, the MSJ is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's IIED and negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claims.
8. Breach of Contract
Cal. Lab. Code § 2922 establishes a presumption of at-will employment. However, "[t]he statute does not prevent the parties from agreeing to any limitation, otherwise lawful, on the employer's termination rights." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 336. Such agreements can, like any other contract, be through an express agreement or an implied-in-fact one. See id. at 337. "Where there is no express agreement, the issue is whether other evidence of the parties' conduct has a tendency in reason to demonstrate the existence of an actual mutual understanding on particular terms and conditions of employment. If such evidence logically permits conflicting inferences, a question of fact is presented. But where the undisputed facts negate the existence [*74]  or the breach of the contract claimed, summary judgment is proper." Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff argues that he can rebut the presumption of at-will employment based on an express or implied agreement to an employment contract. This position is unpersuasive. Fath has declared that Plaintiff, like all employees of Continental, is an at-will employee. Fath Decl. ¶ 4. This position is supported by a Human Resources policy manual stating that all employees are at-will. See Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit K, Dkt. 55-4 at 66 ("CNA and CNA employees recognize their mutual right to end their employment relationship at any time and acknowledge that such relationship is one of employment at will."). In response, Plaintiff declares that in late 2016, "Anderson announced that there was plenty of work in his offices, and that [employees] should remain calm because there would be no layoffs." Carrico Decl., Dkt. 73-3 ¶ 34. Plaintiff also declares that in his communications with Finzer, she told him "not to worry, because [his] job would be 'protected' while [he] was out on medical leave." Id. ¶ 45. Finally, Plaintiff relies on a statement by Hamilton that, although [*75]  employment at Continental is at-will, she had not ever personally terminated someone "for no reason at all." Hamilton Depo. at 24:12-25:5.
The evidence offered by Plaintiff is not sufficient to show a triable issue as to whether his at-will employment had been modified through an express or implied agreement that was then breached by Defendants through his termination. No reasonable jury could find, based on the statements identified by Plaintiff, that they reflected an implied or express change to the terms of his employment that had been in effect since 1999.14 Defendants have presented evidence that the at-will classification applies to all their employees. The evidence identified by Plaintiff does not present a basis for concluding that Defendants made a significant modification to the nature of his employment through the identified statements. There is also no evidence as to the specific terms of this alleged modification to Plaintiff's employment agreement, such as the length of his guaranteed employment or the standards that would have to be met in order for Defendants to terminate Plaintiff under an implied "for cause" standard. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 337, 347 (describing importance of "particular terms [*76]  and conditions" toward establishing an agreement, and reversing Court of Appeal's determination that there were triable issues as to contractual modification to at-will employment).
For these reasons, the MSJ is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's breach of contract claim.
9. Whether CNA Financial is Plaintiff's Employer
a) Legal Standards
The Ninth Circuit has stated that, under California law,
The key factor to consider in analyzing whether an entity is an employer is "the right to control and direct the activities of the person rendering service, or the manner and method in which the work is performed." Serv. Employees Int'l Union v. County of L.A., 225 Cal. App. 3d 761, 275 (1990) (internal quotations and citation omitted). "A finding of the right to control employment requires . . . a comprehensive and immediate level of 'day-to-day' authority over employment decisions." Vernon v. State, 116 Cal. App. 4th 114, 10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 121 (2004).
Doe I v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 572 F.3d 677, 682 (9th Cir. 2009).
b) Application
CNA Financial, one of the two entity defendants, argues that it did not employ Plaintiff. It contends that it is only the parent holding company of Plaintiff's employer Continental, and does not itself have an employment relationship with Plaintiff. This position is persuasive.
Through a declaration of a Continental Financial Analysis Director and Assistant Secretary, Defendants have [*77]  presented evidence that CNA Financial is the holding company of Continental. See Declaration of David B. Lehman ("Lehman Decl."), Dkt. 55-3 ¶ 2. They have also presented evidence that Continental was Plaintiff's employer. This includes Plaintiff's W-2 from 2017, which reflects his employer as Continental. See Defendants' Evidence, Exhibit L, Dkt. 55-4 at 90. Plaintiff's W-2 statements between 2007 and 2016, which have been submitted by Plaintiff, also state that his employer was Continental. See Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 67, Dkt. 73-75. As to CNA Financial, the declaration submitted by Defendant states that it "has officers and directors but it does not have any employees." Lehman Decl., Dkt. 55-3 ¶ 2. This declaration states that "Plaintiff Alan Carrico was only an employee of [Continental], he was paid by [Continental], and was issued a W-2 Form by [Continental]." Id. ¶ 4. This evidence meets Defendants' initial burden to show that CNA Financial did not employ Plaintiff. Therefore, the burden shifted to Plaintiff to identify "specific facts demonstrating the existence of genuine issues for trial" as to whether he was in fact employed by that entity, either in addition to or instead [*78]  of Continental. In re Oracle Corp. Secs. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324).
Plaintiff has failed to identify evidence sufficient to create a triable issue as to whether CNA Financial employed him. He identifies numerous documents on which the name "CNA" appears in a context that could suggest that he had an employment relationship with a "CNA" entity. These include: (i) his 2005 and 2006 W-2 statements, Plaintiff's Evidence, Exhibit 67; (ii) documents regarding Plaintiff's employment that refer to him as a CNA employee, PSF ¶¶ 208-14; (iii) policies regarding leave and forms included "CNA," not "Continental," on them, id. ¶ 215-16; (iv) that CNA was listed as the provider of several of the benefits available to Plaintiff through his employment, id. ¶¶ 225-232. However, none of these documents shows that CNA Financial is the entity that had an employment relationship with Plaintiff. Instead, this evidence as to the use of the name "CNA" is consistent with Defendants' declaration: that "CNA" "is not a company" and is instead "a service mark registered . . . by CNA Financial" that may be used by that entity's subsidiaries, which include Continental. Lehman Decl., Dkt. 55-3 ¶ 3.
In light of that evidence, the use of "CNA" in association [*79]  with Plaintiff's employer does not mean that he was employed by CNA Financial. Rather, it confirms his link to Continental, as to which there is no dispute that there was an employment relationship. For the same reason, the references to "CNA" as an employer of other individuals during their deposition testimony (see Opposition, Dkt. 73 at 32; see also Transcript of June 24, 2019 Hearing, Dkt. 96 at 45) is also consistent with Defendants' position that CNA is a service mark. None of this evidence shows that the holding company entity CNA Financial had "a comprehensive and immediate level of 'day-to-day' authority over employment decisions" that affected Plaintiff or those other individuals. Doe, 572 F.3d at 682 (quoting Vernon, 116 Cal. App. 4th at 127-28).
For these reasons, no reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff was employed by CNA Financial, rather than only by its wholly owned subsidiary Continental. Because CNA Financial is not a proper defendant in this action, the MSJ is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claims against CNA Financial.
10. Punitive Damages
a) Legal Standards
Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a) provides that punitive damages may be awarded "where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or [*80]  malice." "The clear and convincing standard requires a finding of high probability so clear as to leave no substantial doubt; sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind." Scott v. Phx Schs., Inc., 175 Cal. App. 4th 702, 715 (2009) (internal quotations and ellipsis omitted). This heightened standard does not, however, require that the plaintiff "'prove' a case for punitive damages" at the summary judgment stage. Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments, 171 Cal. App. 4th 1004, 1053, 90 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (2009). Indeed, "[i]n the usual case, the question of whether the defendant's conduct will support an award of punitive damages is for the trier of fact, 'since the degree of punishment depends on the peculiar circumstances of each case.'" Id. (quoting Hannon Eng'g, Inc. v. Reim, 126 Cal. App. 3d 415, 431, 179 Cal. Rptr. 78 (1981)).
Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(c) defines "malice" as "conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." Id. It defines "oppression" as "despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights." Id. It defines "fraud" as "an intentional misrepresentation, deceit or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of [*81]  thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury." Id.
An employer may be held liable for punitive damages based upon the acts of its employee only if the employer "ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(b). "With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation." Id. The term "managing agent" includes "only those corporate employees who exercise substantial independent authority and judgment in their corporate decisionmaking so that their decisions ultimately determine corporate policy." White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 563, 566-67, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999).
b) Application
Defendants argue that Plaintiff "has no basis to recover punitive damages" for two reasons. First, because there is no basis for concluding that anyone working for the employer acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. Second, none of the individuals on whose actions Plaintiff might rely, qualifies as an officer, director, or managing agent of the entity defendants. Plaintiff responds that fact [*82]  issues preclude summary judgment.
(1) Oppression, Fraud, or Malice
"Punitive damages are available for . . . wrongful discharge claims." Krinsky v. Israel Discount Bank of N.Y., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15805, 2016 WL 540741, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 9, 2016). However, "wrongful termination, without more, will not sustain a finding of malice or oppression." Scott, 175 Cal. App. 4th at 717 ("Because there was nothing more than a wrongful termination here, punitive damages were not warranted, and the trial court should have granted defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of punitive damages."); Krinsky, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15805, 2016 WL 540741, at *6 (granting motion for summary judgment with respect to request for punitive damages because "[b]esides the termination itself, there is no evidence that [defendant] acted in an egregious or despicable manner").
Evidence that an employer "attempted to hide the reason it terminated [the plaintiff] . . . [or] engaged in a program of unwarranted criticism to justify [the plaintiff's] termination" may sustain a finding of malice or oppression. Scott, 175 Cal. App. 4th at 717; see, e.g., Thomas v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27527, 2014 WL 819396, at *10 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 3, 2014) (denying motion for summary judgment because there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether the employer engaged in a "program of warranted criticism" of the plaintiff's job performance where the plaintiff offered evidence that his employer "singled him out for criticism [*83]  ever since he reported the [defendant's] activities to the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement"); cf. Escriba v. Foster Poultry Farms, 793 F. Supp. 2d 1147, 1168 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (granting motion for summary judgment on prayer for punitive damages because "Plaintiff has not provided any direct evidence of fraudulent conduct. Plaintiff has not shown collusion between her supervisors to wrongfully terminate her, or any past or present expression of animus toward her by any Defendant. She had an extensive leave history which was not held against her. [Defendant] did not hide the alleged wrongful reason it terminated Plaintiff.").
Here, there is a triable issue as to whether Defendants' agents "attempted to hide the reason" for Plaintiff's termination. Scott, 175 Cal. App. 4th at 717. This is supported by a possible inference that the RIF Memo and the resulting termination were not the basis for terminating Plaintiff. Thus, there is a triable issue as to whether this was instead due to Plaintiff's failure to return from leave, his prior complaints, and/or his underlying disability. A reasonable jury could conclude based on these facts that Defendants' agents acted in a manner that would provide a basis for an award of punitive damages.
(2) Leadership Role of Involved Individuals
As noted, the term [*84]  "managing agent" includes "only those corporate employees who exercise substantial independent authority and judgment in their corporate decisionmaking so that their decisions ultimately determine corporate policy." White, 21 Cal. 4th at 566-67. In White, the defendant was "a large corporation that operate[d] a chain of stores and gasoline service stations throughout California." Id. at 580. A "zone manager" who managed eight stores and 65 employees and "reported to department heads in the corporation's retail management department" was deemed a managing agent. Id. at 577. By contrast, in Roby, the California Supreme Court determined that a person who managed four out of 20,000 employees was not a managing agent, but assumed -- without analysis because it was not challenged — that at least one of the "midlevel managers (the head of Roby's distribution center and the regional human resources director)" was. 47 Cal. 4th at 714-15.
Plaintiff has shown a genuine dispute that at least one of the individuals involved in the decision to terminate him exercised sufficient authority at the corporate level to provide a basis for seeking punitive damages from the entity defendants.15 For example, it is undisputed that Hamilton played a role in the determination to [*85]  terminate Plaintiff through a RIF, and that she became involved in discussions about Plaintiff's leave that pre-dated the RIF determination. As to her responsibilities within Continental, she testified that she oversees "most of the West and then some of the South and the Northern region," which includes a role overseeing Defendants' operations in nine states. Hamilton Depo. at 22:18-23:14. In addition to having "[m]ore than a hundred" people under her supervision, id. at 24:6-8, Hamilton reports to a person who in turn "oversee[s] everyone in litigation" nationally. Id. at 28:7-23. This evidence is sufficient to show issues of fact as to Hamilton's role in formulating Continental's corporate policy. Evidence as to the roles of the other individuals could also support a jury determination that one or more of them was a managing agent. See PSF ¶¶ 192-202.
In support of their position that none of the individuals involved in Plaintiff's termination is a "managing agent," Defendants rely entirely on conclusory declarations submitted by the four individuals they identify as non-managing agents. See DSF ¶ 72 (citing four declarations that each state that the declarant "do[e]s not have any [*86]  role in formulating . . . corporate policies," or something to this effect). The actual responsibilities of these individuals are the relevant consideration. By failing to show that their responsibilities did not, as a matter of law, involve the setting of corporate policy, Defendants have failed to show that summary judgment is warranted on this basis. Cf. Davis v. Kiewit Pacific Co., 220 Cal. App. 4th 358, 369, 162 Cal. Rptr. 3d 805 (2013) (declaration "simply parroting" the applicable standard insufficient to shift burden to employee).
* * *
For the foregoing reasons, there is a genuine dispute as to whether Defendants' actions were oppressive, malicious, or fraudulent and whether they were undertaken or otherwise ratified by a managing agent of the corporate defendants. Therefore, the MSJ is DENIED as to the prayer for punitive damages.

V. Conclusion
For the reasons stated in this Order, the OSC is DISCHARGED and Anderson is DISMISSED as a fraudulently joined defendant. The MSJ is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, as follows:

The parties previously stipulated to continue expert discovery deadlines, to be reset based on the date of issuance of any order discharging the OSC. Based on that stipulation (Dkt. 85), which was approved with specific dates to be reset through the order ruling on the OSC (Dkt. 86), the Scheduling Order will be amended following the parties' upcoming settlement conference with Judge Rosenbluth; provided, however, this is without prejudice to a request by one or both parties to set a schedule at this time. If no such request is made, then on or before July 3, 2020, the parties shall file a joint report stating whether [*88]  the matter has settled. If it has settled, the joint report shall include a proposed date by which the parties will file a request for the dismissal of this action. If it has not settled, the joint report shall state the parties' collective and/or respective positions as to deadlines for any remaining discovery or other pretrial processes in this action. Based on a review of the joint report, the Court will then either set dates, or a status conference to discuss any open issues as to scheduling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
