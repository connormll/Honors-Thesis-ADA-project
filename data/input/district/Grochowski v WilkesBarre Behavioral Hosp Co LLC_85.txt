REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. Statement of Facts and of the Case

A. Introduction
This action presents an employment dispute between Shelley Grochowski and her former employer, Wilkes-Barre Behavioral Hospital. The case comes before us for consideration of the defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 18), which seeks dismissal of all of Grochowski's claims under state and federal law. These claims include allegations of violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, (ADA); the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA); the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA); and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. (PHRA).
While the background of this dispute is marked by two starkly contrasting factual narratives, when we construe the evidence in a light most favorable to Grochowski, as we are required to do at this stage of the proceedings, we find that in May of 2014 when [*2]  Grochowski was eight months pregnant she complained to her supervisors about alleged pregnancy discrimination. Shortly thereafter, these same supervisors denied Grochowski's requests for a workplace accommodation which would have allowed this pregnant employee the opportunity to work in an air conditioned office where she would not have suffered from heat while working. Further, the evidence construed in a light most favorable to Grochowski reveals that one month later, June 18, 2014, Grochowski's employers commenced an investigation and termination proceedings against her, ostensibly because she violated the hospital's time and attendance policy, which permitted her a half-hour break without clocking out, by taking a 36-minute break without clocking out. The defendant began this termination process two days before Grochowski commenced her pregnancy related FMLA leave, and ten days after she returned from this leave Grochowski was terminated for this 6 minute time-and-attendance infraction. While the hospital's Human Relations decision-maker insisted that discriminatory animus played no role in this decision, she was fully aware of Grochowski's pregnancy and FMLA leave status at the [*3]  time that the decision was made to fire this long-time hospital employee, and at least some evidence suggests that hospital personnel recognized that their actions could be perceived as discriminatory, since they discussed the need to prepare documentation to defend their conduct in court. Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to Grochowski, for the reasons set forth below we conclude that while some of her claims fail as a matter of law, Grochowski's primary claims of pregnancy discrimination and FMLA leave retaliation survive and present disputed issues of fact which must be resolved at trial.

B. Factual Background
In 2014 Shelly Grochowski was employed by the Wilkes-Barre Behavioral Hospital Company, at its First Hospital facility, a 155-bed psychiatric treatment facility located in Kingston, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 19, ¶1.) Grochowski had worked within the Wilkes-Barre hospital system for approximately 18 years, and had held a number of business office positions at First Hospital for 10 years, since March of 2004. (Id., ¶2.)
Grochowski was disabled; she suffered from Type I diabetes. Grochowski was also the primary care giver for another disabled individual, her autistic son. [*4]  In addition, by the spring of 2014 Grochowski was pregnant and was awaiting the birth of her child in the summer of 2014. Because of her diabetes Grochowski's pregnancy was regarded as a high-risk pregnancy.
In March of 2014 Grochowski was supervised at work by the Hospital Business Office Director, Barbara Peters, and Business Office Supervisor Sandra Klem. (Id., ¶¶ 3 and 7.) On March 24, 2014, Peters offered Grochowski an overnight shift position at the hospital, which Grochowski accepted. This shift change was specifically linked to Grochowski's pregnancy, and reflected Peters' awareness of Grochowski's condition, since Peters offered this position to Grochowski because she had been using intermittent leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") for medical appointments relating to her pregnancy and Peters told Grochowski it would be in her interest to work nights in order to avoid using FMLA leave for medical appointments that were scheduled during the day. (Id., ¶6.)
Two months later, as Grochowski entered the eighth month of her pregnancy, she requested a transfer to a second shift job at the hospital. This request was denied for reasons that Grochowski suspected were [*5]  related to her pregnancy, and on May 3, 2014, Grochowski complained about this alleged pregnancy discrimination to her immediate supervisor, Sandra Klem. (Doc. 19-4, Ex. 5, p. 39.) As Klem described this discrimination complaint in an email that she forwarded to Barbara Peters, who also supervised Grochowski, the plaintiff:
was extremely upset that she couldn't go to the second shift and she stated she knows for a fact that [a co-worker with whom she would have switched jobs] was in favor of the switch but was talked out of it. She then asked if [Peters] just doesn't like her and is trying to push her out because she was barely on that shift when [Peters] immediately hired someone else for the day shift. She feels that what's happening is discrimination against her character because she's pregnant. She cried and said she was violently sick and wouldn't be in that evening to work. Later that afternoon, Shelly [Grochowski] called . . . back apologizing for her actions on the phone.
(Id.) Neither Klem nor Peters investigated this claim of workplace pregnancy discrimination. Nor did they report this allegation to the hospital's human resources staff. ( Doc. 19-4.)
At about the same time that [*6]  Grochowski made this pregnancy discrimination complaint to her supervisors she also sought a workplace accommodation due to her pregnancy. Grochowski's night shift duties required her to work in a small, stifling office which lacked air conditioning. In May of 2014, Grochowski made several requests for permission to work out of an air conditioned office. (Doc. 25, ¶10.) Klem and Peters, who had recently been accused of pregnancy discrimination by Grochowski, denied these requests, stating in response to Grochowski's requests for an air conditioned work space as she came to term in her pregnancy: "absolutely not." (Id.) While the defendant suggests that Grochowski's accommodation request was not linked by the plaintiff to her advanced pregnancy, this contention seems to be disputed by Grochowski, whose testimony expressly linked the request to her pregnancy when she stated that she sought an air conditioned workplace because; "Like, it's now June, I'm at the point I'm eight months pregnant, didn't help. It was unbearable." (Doc. 19-3, page 120, lines 12-14.)
One month later, on June 17 and 18, 2014, these managers, in conjunction with the hospital's Human Resources Director Lisa Goble, [*7]  launched an investigation into Grochowski's workplace conduct as a result of an incident in which it was alleged that she had left the hospital without clocking out of work for a total of 36 minutes. This investigation began on June 18, 2014, less than two days before Grochowski began her FMLA pregnancy related leave. The investigation concluded approximately ten days after Grochowski returned from this FMLA leave in September of 2014 with a decision to terminate the plaintiff, the most severe sanction available under the hospital's progressive discipline policy. Thus, this investigation and termination fell in a very close temporal proximity to Grochowski's use of FMLA leave for her pregnancy and postpartum recovery.
The justification provided by the hospital and its Human Relations Director, Lisa Goble, for the decision to terminate this longstanding employee was that she had committed a grave Level IV workplace infraction by falsifying work records. The background of this justification is mired, however, in hotly disputed factual issues. From the hospital's perspective, the justification for firing Grochowski for records falsification stemmed from the hospital's time and attendance [*8]  policy. As described by Goble, the hospital's H.R. Director, this policy permitted employees to take breaks of up to 30 minutes without clocking out of work, but any break in excess of 30 minutes required an employee to clock out of work. (Doc. 19-4, pp. 24-6.)
While Goble insisted that Grochowski's immediate termination was justified based upon a single infraction of this rule, even one which involved an unexplained absence of as little as 6 minutes beyond the 30 minute threshold permitted by the hospital, when questioned she could cite no other examples in which a single absence a few minutes in excess of this 30 minute threshold had led to an employee's termination. (Doc. 19-4, pp.44-5.) Moreover, other evidence suggested that within the hospital there was a disparity between this policy, as written, and the policy, as applied. Specifically Grochowski testified that her supervisor, Peters, allowed absences of up to one hour from the workplace, and deemed breaks taken in the hospital parking lot not to be absences for purposes of the time and attendance policy. (Doc.25, ¶¶19-32.) With this understanding of the hospital policy, according to Grochowski it was her practice to periodically [*9]  leave a cup of coffee in her car to cool when she arrived at work. She would then go out to her parked car, turn on the air conditioning and enjoy a cool drink in the parking lot, conduct she did not regard as a rules infraction, far less an offense which would lead to termination of her employment. (Id.) Grochowski further stated that when H.R. staff and Peters met with her in September of 2014 to address this alleged rules infraction, Peters supported her description of this policy as applied by Peters, contradicting H.R. staff. (Doc. 19-3, pp. 252-3.)
In any event, in Grochowski's case the evidence showed that on the evening of June 17-18, 2014, Grochowski left the hospital building at approximately, 11:40 p.m., and returned at approximately 12:16 a.m., a 36 minute absence. When Grochowski returned to work she had in her possession a cup of coffee. Grochowski's supervisor, Barbara Peters, learned of her alleged absence from work on June 18, 2014 when a co-worker sent an email to Peters reporting that Grochowski could not be located for a period of time during her shift and returned to her work area with a cup of coffee. (Doc. 19, ¶36.) This report led Peters and H.R. Director Goble [*10]  to launch an investigation. As part of this investigation Grochowski's supervisors canvassed her building access card records, and assigned a subordinate to review hospital surveillance videos. Hospital supervisors also conducted a forensic review of Grochowski's computer usage in an effort to further document workplace infractions on Grochowski's part. (Doc. 19, ¶¶37-46.)
On June 18, 2014, Peters reported the preliminary results of her investigation to H.R. Director Goble. (Id., ¶47.) Peters' report to Goble made it unmistakably clear that Grochowski was a pregnant employee who was scheduled for FMLA leave since Peters noted for Goble "What is the level of disciplinary action for this situation. I want to be clear due to her Pregnancy FMLA." (Id.) Having been specifically informed by Peters that she was dealing with a pregnant employee with impending FMLA leave whose unexplained absence spanned 36 minutes, 6 minutes over the threshold defined by hospital policy, Goble made a determination that this conduct warranted the termination of Grochowski from the position she had held at the hospital for the past decade. (Id., ¶¶48-49.) Yet, even as she made this decision Goble's contemporaneous [*11]  emails indicated that she recognized that this action could be deemed potentially discriminatory since Goble instructed staff to preserve the video evidence depicting Grochowski leaving the hospital building and returning with a cup of coffee since that evidence would be needed for court. (Doc.19-4, pp. 36-7, Doc. 38.)1
Grochowski commenced FMLA pregnancy-related leave on June 19, 2014. However, upon her return from leave in September, 2014, hospital officials once again began monitoring her computer activity and movements within the hospital. When this investigation identified several instance in which Grochowski was not logged onto her computer, and revealed one instance in which Grochowski clocked out of work for 37 minutes, (Doc. 19, ¶¶58-62), she was summoned to a disciplinary meeting on September 11, 2014, with her supervisor Peters and an H.R. representative, Susan Chandler. At this meeting, which occurred less than one week after Grochowski returned from her postpartum FMLA leave, the plaintiff was confronted with these alleged rules violations, and was warned that she faced possible termination. On September 15, 2014 H.R. Director Goble terminated Grochowski's employment, notwithstanding [*12]  the recommendation of her immediate supervisor, Barbara Peters, that Grochowski not be fired for this offense. (Doc. 19-5, p.48.)
While the justification provided by the hospital for Grochowski's termination initially focused upon what the hospital described as a Level IV violation, this failure to clock out for a 36 minute break, during unemployment compensation proceedings the hospital proffered a different primary explanation for its actions, asserting that Grochowski was found on June 18, 2014 in an office that was not her regularly assigned work station. (Compare Doc. 30 and 36.) This justification for the hospital's decision was not deemed adequate to deny unemployment compensation benefits for Grochowski. (Id.) Moreover, for her part, Grochowski explained that she was simply using this office, with the permission of the employee who otherwise worked in that office, because it afforded her the air conditioning that she had been denied by her supervisors.

C. Procedural History
This lawsuit then ensued following the hospital's decision to fire Grochowski. (Doc. 1.) Grochowski's complaint lodges 10 counts of workplace discrimination against the hospital. Specifically, in this complaint [*13]  Grochowski alleged that the denial of her requests for workplace accommodations and her subsequent termination constituted: (1) a failure to accommodate, discrimination, and retaliation in violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, (Doc.1 Counts I-III); (2) a failure to accommodate, unlawful discrimination, and retaliation in violation of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (Id., Counts IV-VI); (4) violations of the interference and retaliation provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act (Id., Counts VII-VIII); and (4) pregnancy discrimination claims in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. (Id., Counts IX and X.)
The hospital has now moved for summary judgment on all of these claims, arguing that all of Grochowski's claims fail as a matter of law. (Doc. 18.) This motion is fully briefed by the parties and is, therefore, ripe for resolution. For the reasons set forth below, we agree that Grochowski's FMLA interference claim fails as a matter of law, since it is undisputed that Grochowski fully utilized her FMLA leave. We also conclude that any disability-based claims grounded upon Grochowski's diabetes fail since there [*14]  is no evidence that Grochowski's termination or the denial of any accommodations for Grochowski were related to this medical condition. Therefore we recommend that these ADA claims, and any accompanying Pennsylvania Human Relations Act claims,2 be dismissed. However, with respect to Grochowski's FMLA retaliation claims, and her pregnancy discrimination claims, we find that there are disputed issues of fact which cannot be resolved through a summary judgment motion but must instead be determined at trial. Therefore, we recommend that this motion for summary judgment be granted, in part, and denied, in part.

II. Discussion

A. Summary Judgment—Standard of Review
Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides as follows:
A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense — or the part of each claim or defense — on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court should state on the record the reasons for granting or denying the motion.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). For purposes of Rule 56, a fact is material if proof of its existence of nonexistence might affect the outcome [*15]  of the suit under the applicable substantive law. Haybarger v. Laurence Cnty. Adult Prob. & Parole, 667 F.3d 408, 412 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). For an issue to be genuine, "all that is required is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial." Id. (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248-49).
Accordingly, in support of a motion for summary judgment, the moving party must show that if the evidence of record were reduced to admissible evidence in court, it would be insufficient to allow the non-moving party to carry its burden of proof. See Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Provided the moving party has satisfied this burden, "its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007). Instead, if the moving party has carried its burden, the nonmoving party must then respond by identifying specific facts, supported by evidence, which show a genuine issue for trial, and may not rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings. See Marten v. Godwin, 499 F.3d 290, 295 (3d Cir. 2007); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c).
In adjudicating the motion, the court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the opposing party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). Where [*16]  the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, then the non-movant's must be taken as true. Id. Additionally, the court is not to decide whether the evidence unquestionably favors one side or the other, or to make credibility determinations, but instead must decide whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented. Id. at 252; see also Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1363. In reaching this determination, the Third Circuit has instructed that:
To raise a genuine issue of material fact . . . the opponent need not match, item for item, each piece of evidence proffered by the movant. In practical terms, if the opponent has exceeded the "mere scintilla" threshold and has offered a genuine issue of material fact, then the court cannot credit the movant's version of events against the opponent, even if the quantity of the movant's evidence far outweighs that of its opponent. It thus remains the province of the factfinder to ascertain the believability and weight of the evidence.
Id. In contrast, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); NAACP v. North Hudson Reg'l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d 464, 476 (3d Cir. 2011).
These [*17]  principles apply with particular force in employment discrimination cases where it is said that "[s]ummary judgment is to be used sparingly." Doe v. C.A.R.S. Prot. Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358, 369 (3d Cir.), order clarified, 543 F.3d 178 (3d Cir. 2008). The reasons for this caution can be simply stated.
[I]n cases involving allegations of employment discrimination, such as this one, the foregoing standard of review is applied with special care because the intent and credibility of parties are typically crucial. Conneen v. MBNA Am. Bank, N.A., 334 F.3d 318, 325 n.9 (3d Cir. 2003); see also Doe v C.A.R.S. Prot. Plus, 527 F.3d 358, 369 (3d Cir. 2008) (observing that "summary judgment is to be used sparingly in employment discrimination cases"). In undertaking this review, the Court avoids making credibility determinations and does not weigh the evidence, and instead must take care to accept as true the nonmovant's evidence and draw all inferences in his favor. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505; see also Marino v. Indus. Crating Co., 358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir. 2004).
Nagle v. Comprehensive Women's Health Servs., P.C., No. 3:15-CV-0042, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9722, 2018 WL 1473833, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 19, 2018), report and recommendation adopted, No. 3:15-CV-0042, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49655, 2018 WL 1474545 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 26, 2018).

B. The Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment Should be Granted, in part, and Denied, in part.
In this case, Grochowski has brought an assortment of claims alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of the FMLA, the ADA, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), and the parallel provisions of the Pennsylvania [*18]  Human Relations Act. It appears that the plaintiff is claiming that the hospital terminated her employment unlawfully due to her disability, her pregnancy and her use of FMLA leave. She also alleged that she was denied reasonable accommodations for her disability, and was discriminated against, when hospital officials denied her request for an air conditioned work space in May of 2014.
For its part, the Hospital flatly disputes all of these allegations of discrimination and retaliation, and insists that it is entitled to a judgment in its favor on all of these claims as a matter of law. As discussed below, we find that Grochowski's FMLA interference claim fails as a matter of law, since it is undisputed that Grochowski fully utilized her FMLA leave, and conclude that any disability-based claims grounded upon Grochowski's diabetes fail since there is no evidence that Grochowski's termination or the denial of any accommodations for Grochowski were related to this particular medical condition. However, in our view, disputed factual issues preclude summary judgment in the defendant's favor on Grochowski's FMLA retaliation and pregnancy discrimination claims.
We consider the plaintiff's claims, [*19]  and the defendant's arguments regarding these claims, separately below.

1. Plaintiff's FMLA Interference Claim is Properly Construed as a Claim Alleging Discrimination or Retaliation Under the FMLA.
At the outset, in Count VII of the complaint, Grochowski avers that the Hospital interfered with her right to avail herself of her rights under the FMLA by terminating her employment. The Hospital correctly argues that this claim is, as a legal matter, not one for interference under the FMLA, but for retaliation.
The FMLA provides for two theories of recovery: for interference with FMLA rights pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1), and for retaliation or discrimination pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2). With respect to interference claims, the Act provides that "[i]t shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under" the Act. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). In order to assert an interference claim, "an employee must show that he was entitled to benefits under the FMLA and that his employer illegitimately prevented him from obtaining those benefits." Sarnowski v. Air Brooke Limousine, Inc., 510 F.3d 398, 401 (3d Cir. 2007). The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that interference claims are grounded in the contention that an employer denied [*20]  a plaintiff substantive rights protected under the FMLA, whereas discrimination and retaliation claims stem from adverse employment action taken because of the plaintiff's invocation of FMLA rights. O'Donnell v. Passport Health Communications, Inc., 561 F. App'x 212, 217-19 (3d Cir.2014).
In this case, the plaintiff's claims are grounded in her assertion that her rights under the FMLA were violated through the hospital's decision to terminate her employment. She makes no claim or showing that her FMLA rights were ever interfered with during her employment, and she has attested that she was never denied FMLA rights during her employment. In cases such as this, where the claims of FMLA liability are predicated on the event of termination, the plaintiff's claims are construed as being brought under 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2) for retaliation. Stephenson v. JLG Indus., No. 09-1643, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34564, at *19 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2011) ("courts have consistently treated claims of interference as a result of termination as retaliation claims"); see also Conoshenti v. Public Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 146-48 (3d Cir. 2004); Mascioli v. Arby's Rest. Grp., Inc., 610 F. Supp. 2d 419, 430-31 (W.D. Pa. 2009) (FMLA interference claim based upon employer's termination of employee in anticipation of future leave is an FMLA retaliation claim); Lynch v. Matthews Int'l, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64261, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64261, 2010 WL 2640597, at *6, n.6 (W.D. Pa. June 29, 2010) (same).
In this case, the plaintiff has purported to bring both FMLA retaliation and interference claims, but has grounded both theories of liability in the hospital's act of terminating her employment. Because [*21]  this theory of liability sounds as a retaliation claim under the FMLA, and not as an interference claim, it is recommended that the Court restrict its consideration of the plaintiff's FMLA claim to 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2) as a retaliation claim, and dismiss Count VII of the complaint, which alleges an FMLA interference violation.

2. Grochowski's ADA Claims Fail on the Merits
In Counts I-III of the complaint, Grochowski contends that she denied reasonable accommodations, and was discriminated or retaliated against based upon her disability, diabetes.3 She then supports these claims by citing to the failure to accommodate her request for air conditioning in May of 2014, and the hospital's actions in terminating her employment in September of 2014 as the discriminatory and retaliatory acts which were allegedly undertaken against her due to this disability.
The ADA's protections extend to all qualified individuals with disabilities, 42 U.S.C. §12112(a), and by its terms the Act imposes three legal obligations on employers. First, under the Act an employer must provide reasonable accommodations to a disabled worker.
"An employee can demonstrate that an employer breached its duty to provide reasonable accommodations because it failed [*22]  to engage in good faith in the interactive process by showing that: '1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith.'" Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 772 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 319-20 (3d Cir.1999)).
Moore v. CVS Rx Servs., Inc., 142 F. Supp. 3d 321, 335 (M.D. Pa. 2015), aff'd, 660 F. App'x 149 (3d Cir. 2016).
The ADA also forbids workplace discrimination against the disabled. In order to make out a prima facie claim for workplace discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she is (1) disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer, and (3) has suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of the discrimination. Laborde v. Casino, No. 3:16-CV-769, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150510, 2016 WL 7735566, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 28, 2016), report and recommendation adopted, No. 3:16-CV-769, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4303, 2017 WL 114085 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 11, 2017) citing Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 F.3d 177, 185 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Stadtmiller v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc., 491 Fed.Appx. 334, 336 (3d Cir. 2012); Gaul v. Lucent Techs., 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir. 1998).
Finally, the ADA prohibits retaliation against the disabled for exercising any of their rights under federal law. "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: [*23]  (1) protected employee activity; (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the employee's protected activity and the employer's adverse action." Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 1997).
These three claims all share a common component. Whether cast as a reasonable accommodation claim or brought under the rubric of discrimination or retaliation, an integral element to any ADA claim is some causal link between the plaintiff's disability and the defendant's allegedly wrongful act. It is upon this essential element of any ADA claim that Grochowski's diabetes-based disability discrimination claims fail.
Turning first to Grochowski's ADA discrimination and retaliation claims based upon her termination, these claims fail for a single reason. There is simply no evidence that the hospital decisionmaker, Lisa Goble, knew that Grochowski was diabetic when she terminated her.4 The absence of any evidence to show that Goble was aware of Grochowski's disability at the time of her discharge leaves the record barren of evidence to show a causal link. This failure of proof, in turn, is fatal to any ADA claims that are grounded upon this discharge. [*24]  See Olson v. GE Astrospace, 101 F.3d 947, 954 (3d Cir. 1996) (where there was no evidence other than "sheer speculation" that the final decisionmaker knew about the plaintiff's condition, there is an absence of evidence to show causation); see also Rinehimer v. Cemcolift, Inc., 292 F.3d 375, 380 (3d Cir. 2002) ("to establish discrimination because of a disability, an employer must know of the disability.").
Likewise, while Grochowski has claimed that she was denied a reasonable accommodation, an air conditioned office, by the hospital in May and June of 2014, she points to no evidence which shows that her request was made, or denied, based upon her disability, diabetes. When accommodations are in issue under the ADA, the Third Circuit has explained that "the burden is on the employee or a representative to inform the employer of both the disability and desire for an accommodation." Drozdowski v. Northland Lincoln Mercury, 321 F. App'x 181, 185 (3d Cir. 2009); see also Sever v. Henderson, 381 F. Supp. 2d 405, 419-20 (M.D. Pa. 2005) (granting summary judgment in favor of employer where plaintiff "failed to produce any evidence that the employer had knowledge of any limitations"). In this case, our review of the record discloses no evidence suggesting that Grochowski sought this office space accommodation due to her disability, diabetes. Instead, at most, the request seemed to have been linked to Grochowski's pregnancy, a condition which [*25]  "is not a qualifying disability" under the ADA. Moore v. CVS Rx Servs., Inc., 142 F. Supp. 3d 321, 344 (M.D. Pa. 2015), aff'd, 660 F. App'x 149 (3d Cir. 2016)(collecting cases). Thus, while the denial of this request may constitute evidence of pregnancy-based discrimination, it does not satisfy the elements of an ADA failure to accommodate disability claim.
Finding that the plaintiff has not presented evidence which reveals a causal link between her disability, diabetes, and the defendant's actions in May and June of 2014, we recommend that these ADA claims, and their state law analogues, be dismissed.

3. There are Disputed Issues of Fact Which Preclude Summary Judgment on Grochowski's FMLA Retaliation and Pregnancy Discrimination Claims.
While Grochowski's FMLA interference and ADA claims appear to fail on the undisputed facts before us, the same cannot be said for the FMLA retaliation and pregnancy discrimination claims leveled by Grochowski against the hospital. In our view, those claims rest on competing inferences which the parties seek to draw from disputed facts, and are not amenable to resolution on a motion for summary judgment.
To prove a claim for FMLA retaliation, an employee "must show that his employer intentionally discriminated against him for exercising an FMLA right." [*26]  Mascioli, 610 F. Supp. 2d at 433 (quoting Martin v. Brevard County Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2008)). The plaintiff's retaliation claims are analyzed under the familiar burden-shifting paradigm prescribed by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Naber v. Dover Healthcare Assocs., 765 F. Supp. 2d 622, 633 (D. Del. 2011); Bearley v. Friendly Ice Cream Corp., 322 F. Supp. 2d 563, 571 (M.D. Pa. 2004); Baltuskonis v. U.S. Airways, Inc., 60 F. Supp. 2d 445, 448 (E.D. Pa. 1999). To establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, the plaintiff must show: (1) plaintiff availed herself of a protected right under the FMLA; (2) plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the plaintiff's protected activity and the employer's adverse employment action. Bearley, 322 F. Supp. 2d at 571. If a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action. Id. If the employer does so, the burden returns to the plaintiff to present evidence to show that the defendant's proffered legitimate reasons were not its true reasons, but were instead merely pretext for its unlawful actions. To carry this burden, the plaintiff must either discredit the defendant's proffered reasons or otherwise adduce evidence showing that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the adverse employment action. Id.; see also Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994).
The Pregnancy Discrimination Act ("PDA"), in turn, extends the protections of Title VII of [*27]  the Civil Rights Act to workplace discrimination based upon pregnancy by stating that:
The terms 'because of sex' or 'on the basis of sex' include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes ... as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work....
42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k).
Under the PDA there is employment discrimination whenever an employee's pregnancy is a motivating factor for the employer's adverse employment decision. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m). In re Carnegie Ctr. Assocs., 129 F.3d 290, 294 (3d Cir. 1997).
Title VII pregnancy discrimination claims are also assessed under the familiar burden shifting framework prescribed by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See In re Carnegie Ctr. Assocs., 129 F.3d 290, 294 (3d Cir. 1997). "Thus, to establish her prima facie case, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that 'she is a member of a protected class, that she was qualified for her position, and that she was discharged "under conditions that give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination."' Geraci, 82 F.3d at 580 (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089)." Reifer v. Colonial Intermediate Unit 20, 462 F. Supp. 2d 621, 640 (M.D. Pa. 2006). See Doe v. C.A.R.S. Prot. Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358, 365 (3d Cir.), order clarified, 543 F.3d 178 (3d Cir. 2008). Further:
Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the employer [*28]  to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817; see also Goosby v. Johnson & Johnson Med., Inc., 228 F.3d 313, 319 (3d Cir.2000). When the defendant meets this burden, the court's "factual inquiry then proceeds to a new level of specificity." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255, 101 S.Ct. 1089. The presumption of discrimination established by the prima facie showing "simply drops out of the picture." St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). If the defendant meets this burden, the plaintiff must then show that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant are merely a pretext for discrimination. See Jones, 198 F.3d at 410. In order to show pretext, a plaintiff must submit evidence which (1) casts doubt upon the legitimate reason proffered by the employer such that a factfinder could reasonably conclude that the reason was a fabrication; or (2) would allow the fact-finder to infer that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employee's termination. See Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.1994); Chauhan v. M. Alfieri Co., Inc., 897 F.2d 123, 128 (3d Cir.1990). Put another way, to avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff's evidence rebutting the employer's proffered legitimate reasons must allow a fact-finder reasonably to infer that each of the employer's proffered non-discriminatory reasons was either a post hoc fabrication or otherwise did not actually motivate the employment [*29]  action (that is, that the proffered reason is a pretext). See Anderson v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 13 F.3d 1120, 1124 (7th Cir.1994); Bodenheimer v. PPG Indus., Inc., 5 F.3d 955, 958 (5th Cir.1993).Lastly, it is important to remember that the prima facie case and pretext inquiries often overlap. As our jurisprudence recognizes, evidence supporting the prima facie case is often helpful in the pretext stage, and nothing about the McDonnell Douglas formula requires us to ration the evidence between one stage or the other. Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d 271, 286 (3d Cir.2000); see also Iadimarco, 190 F.3d at 166 (explicitly referring to the evidence of the prima facie case in finding evidence supporting pretext); Jalil v. Avdel Corp., 873 F.2d 701, 709 n. 6 (3d Cir.1989) ("Although this fact is important in establishing plaintiff's prima facie case, there is nothing preventing it from also being used to rebut the defendant's proffered explanation.").
Doe v. C.A.R.S. Prot. Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358, 369-70 (3d Cir.), order clarified, 543 F.3d 178 (3d Cir. 2008).
Finally, in conducting this burden-shifting analysis at summary judgment we must remain mindful of one other consideration. In this setting we are enjoined that "[s]ummary judgment is to be used sparingly in employment discrimination cases." Id. at 369.
Guided by these legal tenets, we conclude that disputed issues of fact preclude summary judgment on Grochowski's pregnancy discrimination and FMLA retaliation claims. On this score, we note that the hospital concedes that Grochowski has presented [*30]  a prima face case of pregnancy discrimination and FMLA retaliation. (Doc. 20, p. 9.) Therefore our consideration of these claims is limited to determining whether the hospital has shown as a matter of law that it had legitimate and non-pretextual reasons for discharging Grochowski for an alleged rules infraction which, at bottom, involved failing to clock out for a break which exceeded the 30 minute limit allowed by hospital policy by a total of 6 minutes.
We conclude that the hospital has not made this showing as a matter of law, but rather must carry that burden as a matter of fact at trial if it is to prevail on this defense. In our view a constellation of factors combine to define this issue as a question of fact for resolution at trial.
First, we note that the nature of this sanction—termination—seems harsh for what on its face appeared to have been a relatively minor infraction involving a work absence that exceeded the 30 minute authorized absence period by only 6 minutes. Further, the severity of this sanction may be unprecedented. Indeed, while H.R. Director Goble chose to characterize this infraction as falsification of records, she also appeared to acknowledge that she was [*31]  unaware of any instance where such a small infraction previously received such a harsh characterization.
This harsh characterization of Grochowski's conduct becomes further suspect when one considers the fact that there may have been a disparity between the hospital's policy, as written, and that policy, as applied. For her part, Grochowski insisted that her conduct was consistent with the policy as applied. This apparent confusion and uncertainty between the written policy, and practice in the field, further undermines the degree of reliance that could reasonably be placed on this proffered justification for terminating Grochowski.
In addition, we remain mindful that in assessing this claim:
[I]t is important to remember that the prima facie case and pretext inquiries often overlap. As our jurisprudence recognizes, evidence supporting the prima facie case is often helpful in the pretext stage, and nothing about the McDonnell Douglas formula requires us to ration the evidence between one stage or the other. Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d 271, 286 (3d Cir.2000); see also Iadimarco, 190 F.3d at 166 (explicitly referring to the evidence of the prima facie case in finding evidence supporting pretext); Jalil v. Avdel Corp., 873 F.2d 701, 709 n. 6 (3d Cir.1989) ("Although this fact is important in establishing plaintiff's prima [*32]  facie case, there is nothing preventing it from also being used to rebut the defendant's proffered explanation.").
Doe v. C.A.R.S. Prot. Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358, 369-70 (3d Cir.), order clarified, 543 F.3d 178 (3d Cir. 2008).
Given the analytical overlap between the elements of the plaintiff's prima facie showing, and her burden to rebut a defendant's claimed legitimate justification as pre-textual, it is well-settled that in order to carry her burden of proof on either of these issues: "a plaintiff may rely on the temporal proximity between the [plaintiff's status and the defendant's adverse action] if 'unusually suggestive.' Id.; Marra, 497 F.3d at 302. In the absence of such a close temporal proximity, we consider the circumstances as a whole, including any intervening antagonism by the employer, inconsistencies in the reasons the employer gives for its adverse action, and any other evidence suggesting that the employer had a retaliatory animus when taking the adverse action." Daniels v. Sch. Dist. of Philadelphia, 776 F.3d 181, 196 (3d Cir. 2015). Applying this analytical paradigm to the instant case, we find that Grochowski has presented sufficient, albeit disputed, facts to defeat the hospital's motion for summary judgment.
At the outset, the facts reveal a temporal proximity which can be seen as unusually suggestive. Thus, on May 3, 2014, Grochowski complained [*33]  to her supervisors, Klem and Peters, about what she perceived to be pregnancy-based discrimination. Peters and Klem never investigated these claims or reported them to Human Resources. Instead, when Grochowski contemporaneously made what she regarded as a pregnancy-related request for an opportunity to work within an air conditioned office in May 2014, that request was categorically denied by Klem and Peters, who reportedly told Grochowski "absolutely not." One month later, in mid-June 2014, these supervisors and H.R. Director Goble undertook an investigation into an alleged workplace infraction by Grochowski involving a 36-minute absence from her workplace. That investigation began mere days before she exercised her pregnancy-related FMLA leave, and concluded days after she used this leave with her termination from work. The close timing of all of these events to Grochowski's exercise of her legal rights discloses the type of temporal proximity which may support a discrimination or retaliation claim.
Moreover, the record reveals other evidence which may also permit an inference of intervening antagonism between Grochowski and her superiors. For example, the adverse actions cited by [*34]  Grochowski all follow closely on the heels of her May 3, 2014 pregnancy discrimination complaint against her supervisors. As a matter of fact, and commonsense, that complaint could be viewed as an event which would give rise to an intervening antagonism against Grochowski. Furthermore, the evidence shows that, while the hospital's Human Relations decision-maker Lisa Goble insisted that discriminatory animus played no role in this decision to fire Grochowski, she was fully aware of Grochowski's pregnancy and FMLA leave status at the time she decided to impose the most severe sanction, and fire this long-time hospital employee for a contested and relatively minor rules infraction. Moreover, at least some evidence suggests that Goble herself recognized that this action could be perceived as discriminatory, since she instructed staff to prepare documentation to defend their conduct in court. This course of conduct may be subject to competing interpretations, but at least one interpretation would support an inference of discriminatory animus.
Finally, the evidence would permit a fact-finder to conclude that there were some "inconsistencies in the reasons the employer gives for its adverse [*35]  action." Daniels v. Sch. Dist. of Philadelphia, 776 F.3d 181, 196 (3d Cir. 2015). In particular, when the hospital fired Grochowski it highlighted her alleged violation of time and attendance rules as the grounds for her discharge, yet at Grochowski's unemployment compensation proceedings, the employer proffered a different primary justification for her termination, asserting that Grochowski was found on June 18, 2014 in an office that was not her regularly assigned work station.
Taken together, we believe that this evidence of temporal proximity, antagonism and inconsistent justification for the harshest of employment actions, the termination of a longtime employee, is sufficient to create disputed issues of fact for trial on these PDA and FMLA retaliation claims. Therefore, the defendant's motion for summary judgment on these claims should be denied.

III. Recommendation
Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that the Hospital's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 18), be GRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in part, as follows:
1. The motion should be GRANTED with respect to Grochowski's FMLA interference claim, Count VII.
2. The motion should be GRANTED with respect to Grochowski's disability-based claims under the ADA, and its state law analogue, [*36]  the PHRA, Counts I-VI.
3. The motion should be DENIED with respect to Grochowski's FNLA retaliation and pregnancy discrimination claims under federal and state law, Counts, VIII-X.
The parties are further placed on notice that pursuant to Local Rule 72.3:
Any party may object to a magistrate judge's proposed findings, recommendations or report addressing a motion or matter described in 28 U.S.C. § 636 (b)(1)(B) or making a recommendation for the disposition of a prisoner case or a habeas corpus petition within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy thereof. Such party shall file with the clerk of court, and serve on the magistrate judge and all parties, written objections which shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings, recommendations or report to which objection is made and the basis for such objections. The briefing requirements set forth in Local Rule 72.2 shall apply. A judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made and may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge, however, need conduct a new hearing only in his or her discretion [*37]  or where required by law, and may consider the record developed before the magistrate judge, making his or her own determination on the basis of that record. The judge may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.
Submitted this 31st day of August, 2018.
