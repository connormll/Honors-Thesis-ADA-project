Opinion



CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
Before the Court is a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro ("Defendant"). See generally Dkt. # 54 ("Mot."). Plaintiff Jammie Hill ("Plaintiff") opposed, see generally Dkt. # 62 ("Opp."), and Defendant replied, see generally Dkt. # 63 ("Reply"). The Court finds the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. After considering the moving, opposing, and reply papers, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
I. Factual Background
This case arises out of several discrimination complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") between 2010 and 2015 by Plaintiff, a computer engineer for the United States Department of the Navy ("Navy"). Mot. 3:3-11. Plaintiff—a disabled, albino, African-American female—alleges she has been discriminated against on the basis of race and color. Id. [*2]  Plaintiff further contends that the Navy (1) failed to accommodate her visual disabilities, (2) retaliated against her for filing Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") complaints with the EEOC, and (3) subjected her to a hostile work environment. Id.
A. Plaintiff's Employment with the Navy
Plaintiff began working for the Navy as an intern in 1998. Deposition of Jammie Hill, Dkt. # 56-5 ("Hill Dep."), 19:12-20:17. She became a permanent employee in 1999 and eventually transferred to the logistics-focused branch where she worked at all times relevant to this case. Id. 20:24-21:5, 22:4-8.
While working in the logistics-focused branch, Plaintiff cycled through three different supervisors: Kenneth Harris ("Harris"), then Julie Fox ("Fox") starting in September 2010, and then Geoffrey Arnold ("Arnold") starting in July 2012. Deposition of Kenneth Harris, Dkt. # 56-11 ("Harris Dep."), 15:17-21, 19:7-16; Dkt. # 56-13 at 11; Dkt. # 56-15 at 13.
B. Plaintiff's Behavior Change and First EEO Complaint
Twelve years after starting her career with the Navy, Plaintiff was scheduled to participate in an annual presentation on October 28, 2010. Harris Dep. 21:23-22:9; Dkt. # 56- 12. Plaintiff had participated [*3]  in this presentation in past years and was familiar with the duties involved. Hill Dep. 88:11-13; Harris Dep. 30:25-31:5. All employees were instructed to send their slides to fellow employee Carrie Reilly ("Reilly"), who would format the slides for consistency. Hill Dep. 75:2-7; Dkt. # 56-12. Shortly after Reilly returned Plaintiff's edited slides, Reilly informed Harris and Fox that she had been physically threatened by Plaintiff. Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, Dkt. # 55 ("DSUF"), ¶ 2. Harris, Fox, and Reilly returned to Plaintiff's cubicle and found her "highly and loudly upset," such that Plaintiff "had a hard time communicating" with Harris. Harris Dep. 36:17-19, 57:20-58:6.
Two weeks later, Harris e-mailed Plaintiff to inquire about the presentation and to ask if Plaintiff was still "up for presenting" on October 28. DSUF ¶¶ 3-5. Plaintiff informed Harris that she would not be able to present because the newly formatted slides affected her visual ability. Id.
The next day—one day before the presentation—Plaintiff contacted an EEO counselor and filed her first informal complaint with the EEOC, alleging discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and disability. DSUF [*4]  ¶ 6; Dkt. # 56-13 at 2-4.
C. Plaintiff's Second EEO Complaint and Performance Review
Five months later, in March 2011, Plaintiff was scheduled for an annual performance review meeting. DSUF ¶ 7; Dkt. # 56-13 at 51. Fox scheduled three meetings with Plaintiff; all of them were canceled, at least one on Plaintiff's own accord. DSUF ¶ 7. Due to an impending deadline, Fox submitted Plaintiff's performance review without first meeting with Plaintiff. DSUF ¶¶ 7-8; Dkt. # 56-13 at 50-53. Plaintiff received the highest rating possible—"acceptable"—and received a performance bonus of $875. Id. However, other employees received higher bonus awards. Plaintiff's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, Dkt. # 62-3 ("PSUF"), ¶ 7. Two months later, Plaintiff filed her second EEO complaint—because she was denied a performance review meeting and believed she had received a "significantly low" performance award—alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, and disability, as well as reprisal. DSUF ¶ 9; Dkt. # 56-13 at 40-44.
D. Plaintiff's Third EEO Complaint
In August 2012, one year after filing her second EEO complaint, Plaintiff informed Arnold, then a team lead in Plaintiff's branch, that she [*5]  was looking for a new start in a trainingrelated branch. Dkt. # 56-15 at 13, 73-74. Arnold was later selected as the new branch manager for Plaintiff's team and on "a couple occasions" spoke to Plaintiff to determine whether she "was still interested in the move." Id.; Deposition of Geoffrey Arnold, Dkt. # 56-7 ("Arnold Dep."), 141:18-23. Arnold began working with management and human resources to create a new position description for Plaintiff in the training branch. Arnold Dep. 141:18-23.
Two months later, Arnold approached Plaintiff and informed her that he had succeeded in creating a position for her in the training branch. DSUF ¶ 17. Despite her earlier requests to transfer to a training-related branch, Plaintiff refused to accept the position without explanation. Id. ¶¶ 19-20. Harris e-mailed Plaintiff letting her know that he was surprised she turned down the new role. Id. ¶ 20. Two days later, Plaintiff filed her third informal EEO complaint, alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, and disability, as well as reprisal for her previous complaints. Id. ¶ 21.
E. Plaintiff's Fourth and Fifth EEO Complaints and Ongoing Performance Issues
Around the same time as Arnold [*6]  was working to create a new position for Plaintiff, he assigned Plaintiff a "mean down time" project that was due in June 2012. DSUF ¶ 13. Plaintiff missed the deadline for that project and continued to miss deadlines until the final deadline was set for October 15, 2012. DSUF PP 13-15; Dkt. # 56-15 at 32, 73. Two weeks before the final deadline, Plaintiff had not completed the project or shown Arnold any progress. DSUF ¶ 15; Dkt. # 56-15 at 32, 73. Plaintiff met with Arnold and two other employees, including Tom Laskoski ("Laskoski"), to discuss Plaintiff's progress. Dkt. # 56-15 at 32, 73. During the meeting, Arnold asked Plaintiff if the task should be passed to Laskoski, Plaintiff responded that she "didn't care," and Arnold reassigned the project. Id.
Around the same time, Plaintiff overheard her team lead, Laskoski, make a racial joke to another employee to the effect of "black mothers dipping their children in black paint at birth." PSUF ¶¶ 13-16. Harris addressed the matter immediately and provided Laskoski with oral counselling. Dkt. # 56-8 at 68:23-70:22.
In November 2012, Plaintiff took an unapproved lunch break. Dkt. # 56-15 at 23-24. When Arnold confronted Plaintiff, she [*7]  admitted as much and retroactively updated her timecard to reflect the break. Id. at 23-24, 26-28. Arnold left for vacation and, upon his return, discovered Plaintiff had realtered her timecard to reflect 30 minutes of overtime pay. Id.; DSUF ¶ 23. Arnold corrected Plaintiff's timecard. Dkt. # 56-15 at 23-24, 26-28; DSUF ¶ 23.
Plaintiff's performance issues did not stop there. In May 2013, Plaintiff received counselling to address her "inappropriate use of use of government equipment, and of potential personal identifiable information (PII) disclosure and control concerns." DSUF ¶ 27. Plaintiff was using Navy equipment to print personal documents and receive personal faxes relating to Plaintiff's side business, Hill Horizons Organization. Id. ¶ 28; Dkt. # 56-13 at 93.
In May 2013, Plaintiff began full-time telework. DSUF ¶ 29. Because a substantial portion of Plaintiff's tasks involved classified information, upon starting telework, she was assigned replacement tasks that did not involve classified information. Dkt. # 56-12 at 102-04. Plaintiff was assigned a task requiring her to reach out to technicians and develop a database of past fleet issues, questions, and steps to resolve issues. [*8]  DSUF ¶ 31. Five months later, Plaintiff had not made any progress on the database. Dkt. # 56-15 at 102. Three and a half months later, after Arnold requested a status update on the project, Plaintiff replied with a blank e-mail attaching a spreadsheet containing only 11 acronyms. Id. at 102-04; DSUF ¶¶ 33-34. Plaintiff reportedly spent 1,300 hours on this assignment. DSUF ¶¶ 33-34. Arnold spoke with Plaintiff about the assignment and asked her for a "plan of action" for the project; Plaintiff responded claiming that Arnold had "set [her] up for failure." Dkt. # 56-15 at 87.
Ten months later, on March 21, 2014, several Navy representatives met with Plaintiff to discuss her performance. Dkt. # 56-15 at 115. Plaintiff received a "letter of caution" for her missed deadlines, insubordination, and lack of responsiveness while teleworking. DSUF ¶ 37. Arnold also provided Plaintiff with a "letter of reprimand" addressing her use of Navy time to operate her side business. Id. ¶ 38. During this meeting, the Navy cancelled Plaintiff's telework agreement and requested that she return to the office. Id. ¶ 39. Plaintiff filed her fourth EEO complaint the same day, alleging discrimination on the basis [*9]  of race, color, and disability, as well as reprisal for prior EEO activity. Id. ¶ 40.
In July 2014, Arnold gave Plaintiff more oral counseling to address her ongoing performance issues. DSUF ¶ 44. Arnold frequently found Plaintiff missing from her desk, and when she was at her desk, Arnold found Plaintiff off-task. Dkt. # 56-15 at 139. Five days after this counseling, Plaintiff filed her fifth EEO complaint, similarly alleging discrimination and reprisal based on her filing of EEO complaints. DSUF ¶ 45.
Plaintiff contends that throughout this time period—May 2012 to July 2014—her supervisors were continually monitoring her and micromanaging her work. PSUF ¶¶ 13-16, 58, 61, 65. Yet, at least half a dozen employees claim that they were afraid of Plaintiff or found her unreliable or incompetent. See DSUF ¶ 2; Dkt. # 56-8 at 68:7-9; Dkt. # 56-13 at 68-69; see generally Arnold Dep.; Dkts. # 56-7, 56-9; 56-15.
F. Plaintiff's Reasonable Accommodation Requests
During her tenure with the Navy, Plaintiff made multiple requests for reasonable accommodations under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C §§ 710 et seq.
After her slides for the October 2010 presentation were reformatted, Plaintiff spoke to her supervisors and explained why her slides [*10]  needed to remain as they were originally formatted for her to present. DSUF ¶¶ 4-5. Plaintiff maintains that she requested that Harris "arrange to have [her] slides returned to their original state" because her disability made it impossible for her to present the reformatted slides, and that Harris denied her request. Declaration of Jammie Hill, Dkt. #62-2 ("Hill Decl."), ¶ 3. According to Defendant, it responded to the request by stating that the slides would "be up on big screen panels" but Plaintiff replied that she would be unable to present under those circumstances. DSUF ¶ 5.
Plaintiff next filed a reasonable accommodation request on September 18, 2012. DSUF ¶ 10. Plaintiff requested a "DaVinci All-in-One HD Video Magnifier," large font keyboard, "ZoomText" software, and an "Amigo CCTV." Id. ¶¶ 11-12. With some delay, the Navy complied with this request. PSUF ¶ 11.
After her telework privileges were revoked in March 2014, Plaintiff submitted another reasonable accommodation request asking for "[r]einstatement of telework" or a "[p]rivate office." DSUF ¶ 41. Arnold asked Plaintiff to submit to an independent medical examination from a Navy ophthalmologist to determine the scope [*11]  of Plaintiff's visual impairment. Id. ¶¶ 41-43. Plaintiff never agreed to the examination. Id. ¶ 42.
In April 2015, Plaintiff received a "Notice of Inability to Accommodate Request with Current Information," which explained that the Navy was unable to corroborate Plaintiff's workspace requirement requests based on the information she had provided. Id. ¶¶ 49-50. The Navy again recommended that Plaintiff receive further medical evaluation. Id.
G. Plaintiff's Sixth EEO Complaint and Promotion Denial
Despite inexplicably turning down a previous offer, Plaintiff continued to express an interest in changing branches. Dkt. # 56-14 at 34. In July 2014, Harris informed Plaintiff that he could not "reassign personnel to other branches" and that she would need to apply for a position in another branch. Id.
Eight months later, Plaintiff learned that she had not been selected to interview for a managerial position in a different branch. Dkt. # 56-13 at 164-65. Based on an objective resume review, Plaintiff ranked 11th out of 13 candidates that applied for the role and thus was not selected for an interview. Id.; DSUF ¶ 46. The same day she was denied the management position, Plaintiff filed her sixth—and [*12]  final—informal EEO complaint. DSUF ¶ 48.
II. Procedural History
On May 31, 2018, Plaintiff sued the acting Secretary of the Navy, see generally Compl., bringing five causes of action:
First Cause of Action: Racial Discrimination in Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. Compl. ¶¶ 28-29.
Second Cause of Action: Color Discrimination in Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. Compl. ¶¶ 30-31.
Third Cause of Action: Reprisal for Engaging in Protected Activity in Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., and Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Compl. ¶¶ 32-33.
Fourth Cause of Action: Violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 710 et seq. Compl. ¶¶ 34-38.
Fifth Cause of Action: Hostile and Abusive Working Environment in Violation of Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA. Compl. ¶¶ 39-40. Defendant now moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims. See generally Mot. For the reasons provided below, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's motion.
III. Legal Standard
"A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the [*13]  basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). If the nonmoving party will have the burden of proof at trial, the movant can prevail by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. See id. If the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).
In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. Rather, it draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987). The evidence presented by the parties must be capable of being presented at trial in a form that would be admissible in evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See Thornhill Publ'g Co. v. Gen. Tel. & Elecs. Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).
IV. Discussion
The Court considers each of Plaintiff's causes of action in turn.
A. First and Second Causes of Action: Racial and Color Discrimination [*14] 
The Ninth Circuit employs the burden-shifting test set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973) in analyzing whether a Title VII of the Civil Rights Act ("Title VII") claim survives summary judgment. See Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trs., 225 F.3d 1115, 1123 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973)). Under this framework, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that "(1) [s]he belongs to a protected class; (2) [s]he was performing [her] job satisfactorily; (3) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) [her] employer treated [her] differently than a similarly situated employee who does not belong to the same protected class." Weil v. Citizens Telecom Servs. Co., LLC, 922 F.3d 993, 1003 (9th Cir. 2019). "[T]he requisite degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case for Title VII . . . on summary judgment is minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of evidence." Chuang, 225 F.3d at 1124 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
After the plaintiff makes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant employer to "articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action." Villiarimo v. Aloha Is. Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1062 (9th Cir. 2002). "If the employer does so, the plaintiff must show that the articulated reason is pretextual 'either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered [*15]  explanation is unworthy of credence.'" Id. (quoting Chuang, 225 F.3d at 1123). "Although a plaintiff may rely on circumstantial evidence to show pretext, such evidence must be both specific and substantial." Id. (citing Goodwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1222 (9th Cir. 1998)).
Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to establish two elements necessary to make a prima facie case of discrimination: (i) satisfactory performance and (ii) identification of a similarly situated employee. See Mot. 14:11-13. The Court agrees, and thus does not reach the parties' additional arguments.

i. Satisfactory Performance
To show that a plaintiff was satisfactorily performing their work in accordance with their employer's legitimate expectations, the plaintiff "must produce evidence, not just pleadings or argument." Weil, 922 F.3d at 1003. "An employee's self-assessment of [her] performance, though relevant, is not enough on its own to raise a genuine issue of material fact." Id.
Defendant directs the Court to a slew of evidence that Plaintiff was insubordinate and failed to do her job, meet deadlines, or communicate with her coworkers. See Mot. 14:15-18:11. As a particularly noteworthy example, Plaintiff submitted a spreadsheet containing just 11 acronyms after ostensibly teleworking for 1,300 hours [*16]  on the project. Dkt. # 56-5 at 195:8-17; DSUF ¶¶ 33-34. This is in addition to evidence that at least half a dozen employees were afraid of Plaintiff or found her unreliable or incompetent. See DSUF P 2; Dkt. # 56-8 at 68:7-9; Dkt. # 56-13 at 68-69; see generally Dkts. # 56-7, 56-9, 56-15.
Plaintiff declares that she "did in fact perform work, which merited a performance award," but she supports this assertion by only her own declaration. See Opp. 8:16. She proffers no evidence to support this assertion besides her own self-assessment. While Plaintiff did receive an $875 performance award based on her work in 2010, see DSUF ¶ 8; Dkt. # 56-13 at 50-52, the award predates much of the evidence that Plaintiff did not satisfactorily perform, see PSUF ¶¶ 1-5, 13-16, 23, 27-28, 30-39, 44, 46-47. Simply put, Plaintiff has set forth no evidence of satisfactory performance beyond her own self-assessment and therefore has failed to carry her burden of production on this element of her discrimination claim. See Weil, 922 F.3d at 1003; see also Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323 (explaining that a movant is entitled to summary judgment if it can point to an absence of evidence in the record if the non-movant bears the burden of proof at trial).

ii. Similarly [*17]  Situated Employee
Further, Plaintiff proffers no evidence that Defendant treated her differently than any other similarly situated employee who does not belong to her protected class—i.e., of the race or color—and thus also fails to satisfy the fourth element of her prima facie claim of discrimination. See Weil, 922 F.3d at 1003.
"It is not enough for employees to be in similar employment positions; rather, the plaintiff and the comparator employee must be 'similarly situated . . . in all material respects.'" Id. at 1004 (citing Moran v. Selig, 447 F.3d 748, 755 (9th Cir. 2006)). "Employees are similarly situated if they have 'similar jobs and display similar conduct.'" Weil, 922 F.3d at 1004 (citing Vasquez v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 641 (9th Cir. 2003)); see also Collins v. Potter, 432 F. App'x 599, 600 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding a purported comparator was insufficiently similar to plaintiff because she was not subject to the same kind of employment agreement, and the record did not suggest that she was ever dishonest or insubordinate like plaintiff).
Plaintiff points to other employees who were not African-American or had not previously filed EEO complaints. See, e.g., Opp. 16:23. These employees, Plaintiff notes, (1) did receive training, (2) did receive performance awards, (3) were not "micro-managed and [] forced out," (4) were not denied overtime, (5) did not receive a letter of caution or [*18]  reprimand, (6) did not have telework agreements revoked, or (7) were interviewed for branch manager positions. Id. 16:16-17:2, 18:19-22, 19:22-26, 20:6-7, 20:22-23, 21:21-22, 22:7-8. But these allegations are not enough to demonstrate that such employees were similarly situated because Plaintiff fails to set forth any evidence that these employees conducted themselves similarly to Plaintiff, for example by failing to finish projects, logging improper overtime, or using Navy equipment for non-government work. See DSUF ¶¶ 13-16, 23, 27-28, 30-39, 44. Therefore, Plaintiff has not pointed to any similarly situated employee, much less shown that any such employee was treated differently.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to make a prima facie case of race or color discrimination, and Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's Title VII race and color discrimination claims. See Weil, 922 F.3d at 1003. The Court thus GRANTS Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's first and second causes of action.
B. Third Cause of Action: Retaliation
Next, the Court addresses Plaintiff's third cause of action for retaliation under Title VII and Title V of the ADA.1 As with discrimination claims, the Ninth Circuit employs [*19]  the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting test to analyze retaliation claims under Title V of the ADA ("Title V") and Title VII. Kauffman v. Sidereal Corp., 695 F.2d 343, 345 (9th Cir. 1982); T.B. ex rel. Brenneise v. San Diego Unified Sch. Dist., 806 F.3d 451, 473 (9th Cir. 2015). A plaintiff has the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. See Kauffman, 695 F.2d at 345. Next, the burden shifts to the defendant to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged actions. Id. And, if the rebuttal succeeds, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show the defendant's rationale was pretextual. Id.
Defendant argues that (i) Plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of retaliation, and in any event, (ii) she cannot show that Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the Navy's actions were pretextual. See generally Mot. The Court agrees.

i. Prima Facie Case
It is a violation of Title VII for an employer to discriminate against an employee "because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this title." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show (1) engagement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link between the activity and employment action. Wrighten v. Metro. Hosps. Inc., 726 F.2d 1346, 1354 (9th Cir. 1984) [*20] . Similarly, it is a violation of Title V of the ADA for an employer to discriminate against an employee "because such an individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). However, to prove a prima facie case, a plaintiff must show the exact same three elements as a Title VII claim. See T.B. ex rel. Brenneise, 806 F.3d at 473.
There is no dispute that Plaintiff engaged in activities protected by Title VII and Title V. DSUF PP 6, 9-10, 21-22, 24, 40-41, 45, 48. Defendant contends that Plaintiff has not demonstrated that any adverse employment action was taken against her because of her protected activities, and thus that Plaintiff has failed to establish the causal link necessary to make a prima facie case of retaliation. Mot. 20:12-19. The Court agrees.
Plaintiff engaged in protected activities when she made multiple requests for reasonable accommodations and filed six EEO complaints between October 2010 and March 2015. See PSUF ¶¶ 6, 10, 12, 24-25, 41, 48. Defendant was aware of this activity. Id. Plaintiff maintains that Defendant's retaliatory behavior began in October 2010 when Plaintiff did not present her portion of a slideshow; however, this activity occurred before Plaintiff filed her first EEO complaint. See Mot. 5:8-18; PSUF ¶ 6.
According [*21]  to Plaintiff, the retaliation continued in March 2011, when she did not meet with a supervisor for an annual performance review and was awarded a below-average performance bonus. Opp. 10:22-26. Further, Plaintiff alleges that the Navy retaliated against her by denying her a promotion, micromanaging her, and denying her reasonable accommodations, as well as when receiving letters of caution and reprimand and having her duties and telework privileges revoked. Opp. 10:27-12:8. Plaintiff contends that each adverse employment action taken against her, over the course of four years, established a pattern of retaliation following Plaintiff's filing of EEO complaints and reasonable accommodation requests because each alleged instance occurred within one year of an EEO filing or at some point after she requested accommodations. Id. 10:18-21.
The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a causal connection between the EEO complaints and the alleged adverse employment activities. To demonstrate a causal connection, Plaintiff must bring forth sufficient evidence to "raise the inference that her protected activity was the likely reason for the adverse action." Cohen v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 686 F.2d 793, 796 (9th Cir. 1982); see also Van Douglas v. Dejoy, 848 F. App'x 245, 247 (9th Cir. 2021); Villiarimo, 281 F.3d at 1064-65.
Plaintiff [*22]  argues that "[a]ll of the events alleged, are within one year of filing of [her] EEO complaints, which created a nexus." Id. But cases accepting a "mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be 'very close.'" Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 269, 273 (2001) (quoting O'Neal v. Ferguson Constr. Co., 237 F.3d 1248, 1253 (10th Cir. 2001)).
An employer's knowledge that an employee engaged in a protected activity, followed by an adverse employment action taken months later, does not itself give rise to an inference of retaliation. See Cornwell v. Electra Cent. Credit Union, 439 F.3d 1018, 1035 (9th Cir. 2006) (upholding grant of summary judgment to the employer on retaliation claim when adverse employment action occurred eight months after protected activity); Filipovic v. K & R Express Sys., Inc., 176 F.3d 390, 398-99 (7th Cir. 1999) (finding no prima facie case because mere passage of four months between protected activity and employment action did not establish a causal connection); Richmond v. ONEOK, Inc., 120 F.3d 205, 209 (10th Cir. 1997) (three months insufficient); Conner v. Schnuck Markets, Inc., 121 F.3d 1390, 1395 (10th Cir. 1997) (four months insufficient).
Beyond a vague temporal sequence of events, Plaintiff fails to provide evidence of a causal connection between the filing of her EEO complaints and the adverse employment activities. In fact, in many instances, Plaintiff filed a complaint [*23]  the day of—or in the subsequent days after—an adverse employment action. In other words, her EEO complaints were a response to adverse employment actions, not the other way around. And in any event, some degree of temporal proximity, without more, does not suggest that the Navy's actions after Plaintiff filed her EEO complaints were caused by her EEO complaints. See Cornwell, 439 F.3d at 1035.
Similarly, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate a causal connection between her reasonable accommodation requests and any adverse employment actions. Plaintiff contends that adverse employment actions occurred months after she requested reasonable accommodations. PSUF ¶ 58. However, beyond limited temporal proximity, Plaintiff does not provide further evidence of a causal connection and thus fails to raise the inference that her accommodation requests were the likely reasons for any adverse employment actions. See Cohen, 686 F.2d at 796; Cornwell, 439 F.3d at 1035.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to establish the causal connection required to make a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of Title VII or Title V. See Wrighten, 726 F.2d at 1354; Cohen, 686 F.2d at 796; T.B. ex rel. Brenneise, 806 F.3d at 473.

ii. Legitimate Reason and Pretext
Even assuming that Plaintiff established a prima facie case of retaliation, the Court finds that Defendant provides [*24]  a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for taking adverse employment actions, and Plaintiff has not provided evidence of pretext. Accordingly, there is an alternative sufficient basis entitling Defendant to summary judgment on Plaintiff's retaliation claim.
If a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that there was a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate [the] plaintiff's employment." Dep't of Fair Emp. & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1247 (2008)). Courts do not require that a defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason be "wise or correct," and while "the objective soundness of an employer's proffered reasons supports their credibility, the ultimate issue is simply whether the employer acted with a motive to [retaliate]." Jefferson v. Boeing Co., 675 F. App'x 672, 674-75 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 358 (2000)); see also Villiarimo, 281 F.3d at 1063 ("[C]ourts only require that an employer honestly believed its reason for its actions, even if its reason is foolish or trivial or even baseless." (internal quotation marks omitted)).
If the defendant satisfies its burden at the second step of the McDonnell Douglas test, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that "the employer's showing was untrue or pretextual." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746 (quoting Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 225 (1999)). Once the defendant [*25]  has put forth a legitimate reason for adverse employment action, the plaintiff must bring "both specific and substantial" evidence to overcome the employer's rationale. Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal Inc., 292 F.3d 654, 659 (9th Cir. 2002). The plaintiff "must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746.
Defendant attributes much of the adverse employer action to Plaintiff's failure to achieve satisfactory job performance by failing to complete projects, meet deadlines, or communicate with coworkers, among other transgressions. See Mot. 14:14-18:11. Further, at least half a dozen employees were afraid of Plaintiff or found her unreliable or incompetent. See DSUF ¶ 2; Dkt. # 56-8 at 68:7-9; Dkt. # 56-13 at 68-69; see generally Dkts. # 56-7, 56-9, 56-15. This reason is facially valid, and, therefore, Defendant has met its burden of establishing a legitimate reason for the adverse employment actions. See Aragon, 292 F.3d at 661 (finding an employee's poor job performance a legitimate reason for taking adverse employment actions); see also Clasen v. Skywest Airlines, Inc., No. ED CV 19-460 DMG (KKx), 2020 WL 7224246, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 19, 2020) (quoting Veronese v. Lucasfilm Ltd., 212 Cal. App. 4th 1, 21 (2012)) ("The employer may fire an employee [*26]  for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based on erroneous facts, or for no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason.").
Accordingly, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to establish that Defendant's proffered reason was pretextual. See Lucent Techs., 349 F.3d at 642. Yet, Plaintiff offers no evidence explaining why Defendant's reasons for taking adverse employment actions were pretextual. See Manatt v. Bank of Am., NA, 339 F.3d 792, 801 (9th Cir. 2003) (granting summary judgment where a plaintiff "failed to introduce any direct or specific and substantial circumstantial evidence of pretext"); Bradley v. Harcourt, Brace & Co., 104 F.3d 267, 270 (9th Cir.1996) (explaining that "an employee's subjective personal judgments of her competence alone do not raise a genuine issue of material fact").
Therefore, Plaintiff also has not met her burden to establish that Defendant's legitimate reasons for the adverse employment actions were pretextual. Defendant is thus entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for retaliation in violation of Title VII and Title V. See Bergene v. Salt River Project Agr. Imp. & Power Dist., 272 F.3d 1136, 1142 (9th Cir. 2001) ("evidence of pretext must be specific and substantial in order to survive summary judgment"). Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's third cause of action.
C. Fourth Cause of Action: Failure to Accommodate [*27] 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to her failure to accommodate claim. See Mot. 21:6-3:3; Reply 6:8-8:2. The Court disagrees.
Disability discrimination claims brought under the Rehabilitation Act incorporate ADA standards. See 29 U.S.C. § 791(f) (incorporating in relevant part 42 U.S.C. § 12112). "To state a prima facie case under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) she is a person with a disability, (2) who is otherwise qualified for employment, and (3) suffered discrimination because of her disability." Walton v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 492 F.3d 998, 1005 (9th Cir. 2007); see also Duvall v. Cnty. of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1135 (9th Cir. 2001). "[D]iscrimination' includes an employer's not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified . . . employee." US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 396 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Relevant here, reasonable accommodations are modifications or adjustments that enable an "employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by . . . other similarly situated employees without disabilities." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(iii).
When an employee requests an accommodation, the employer "must engage in an interactive process with the employee to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation." Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002). The interactive process requires "(1) direct [*28]  communication between the employer and employee to explore in good faith the possible accommodations; (2) consideration of the employee's request; and (3) offering an accommodation that is reasonable and effective." Id. Employers are not obligated to provide the specific accommodation the employee "requests or prefers" and retain the "ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations." EEOC v. UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d 1103, 1111 (9th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). However, "an employer cannot satisfy its obligations under the ADA by providing an ineffective modification"—one that does not accommodate the employee's limitations. Id. at 1110 (citations omitted). If the employer knows that the initial accommodation provided is ineffective, the employer's obligation to engage in the interactive process continues. Id. at 1111 (citation omitted). Whether an accommodation is reasonable is generally a question of fact. Id. (citing Lujan v. Pac. Mar. Ass'n, 165 F.3d 738, 743 (9th Cir. 1999)); Fuller v. Frank, 916 F.2d 558, 562 n.6 (9th Cir 1990).
Here, Defendant allegedly failed to accommodate Plaintiff's request for her presentation slides to be returned to their original format so she could present at an annual meeting as she had in previous years. Opp. 17:5-18:4. Plaintiff proffers evidence that she had informed a supervisor, Harris, that she could not present the [*29]  changed slides because of her disability and requested that her slides be returned to their original format. See PSUF ¶ 3, Dkt. # 62-4 at 42:24-43:16; Dkt. # 62-5 at 9-10; Hill Decl. ¶ 3. Plaintiff's request to have her slides returned to their original format so that she could present at the annual meeting was a reasonable accommodation request—i.e., a request by an "employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by . . . other similarly situated employees without disabilities." See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(iii); see also Zivkovic, 302 F.3d at 1089 ("An employee is not required to use any particular language when requesting an accommodation but need only inform the employer of the need for an adjustment due to a medical condition.") (citation omitted).
Defendant claims that it responded to this request—i.e., engaged in the interactive process—by telling Plaintiff that the slides would "be up on the big screen panels." See DSUF ¶ 5. Conversely, Plaintiff maintains that Defendant denied her requested accommodation and that she was unable to participate in the presentation because her slides were not returned to their original format. Hill Decl. ¶ 3. In other words, Plaintiff disputes the efficacy [*30]  of Defendant's proposed accommodation—"big screen panels." See DSUF ¶ 3. Taking Plaintiff's version of the facts as true, a jury could reasonably conclude that Defendant's proposed modification did not accommodate Plaintiff's visual limitations and was therefore ineffective. See UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d at 1110-14. There is thus a genuine dispute as to whether the proposed accommodation was effective and reasonable under the circumstances. See Zivkovic, 302 F.3d at 1089.
Although Defendant was not required to provide the specific accommodation Plaintiff requested and was instead entitled to choose between effective accommodations, providing an ineffective accommodation would not satisfy Defendant's obligations under the ADA. See UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d at 1111, 1113. Defendant acknowledges that Plaintiff responded to its proposal to present the slides on "big screen panels" by stating that she would be unable to present under those circumstances. DSUF ¶ 5. A jury could reasonably conclude that Plaintiff's response made Defendant aware that the initial accommodation it proposed was ineffective and thus that Defendant had a continuing obligation to engage in the interactive process and find an effective accommodation. See UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d at 1110. Yet, Defendant does not contend that it continued to engage [*31]  with Plaintiff or proposed another accommodation to enable her to present her slides. Nor does Defendant argue that Plaintiff's requested accommodation—changing her slides back to their original font, size, and color—would have imposed undue hardship. See id. (noting that employers need not make accommodations that impose "undue hardship" on their business operations).
In sum, because there are genuine disputes of fact concerning whether Defendant's proposed modification was reasonable and effective, and a jury could reasonably determine that Defendant was aware that its proposed modification was ineffective, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim. See UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d at 1113-14; Gonzales v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 142 F. Supp. 3d 961, 979 (C.D. Cal. 2015). Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's fourth cause of action.
D. Fifth Cause of Action: Hostile and Abusive Work Environment
To prevail on a Title VII claim that a workplace is hostile, a plaintiff must show "(1) that [s]he was subjected to verbal or physical conduct of a racial or sexual nature; (2) that the conduct was unwelcome; and (3) that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the plaintiff's [*32]  employment and create an abusive work environment." Vasquez v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 642 (9th Cir. 2003). "A plaintiff must show that the work environment was both subjectively and objectively hostile." McGinest v. GRE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1113 (9th Cir. 2004).
Subjective hostility is clearly established here through Plaintiff's testimony and complaints to the EEOC, and Defendant does not challenge subjective hostility. Thus, only objective hostility is at issue.
Courts consider several factors in evaluating the objective hostility of a work environment, including "the 'frequency of discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'" Id. (emphasis added). "The required level of severity of seriousness varies inversely with the pervasiveness or frequency of the conduct." Id.
Here, reviewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Navy's conduct was not severe or pervasive enough to constitute an objectively hostile work environment. Of the facts which Plaintiff claims give rise to a hostile work environment, only one—that Laskoski allegedly made a comment about "black mothers dipping their children in black paint"—is racist in nature. [*33]  See PSUF ¶ 13; Dkt # 62-5 at 224. And insofar as Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim is predicated on alleged disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, the Ninth Circuit does not appear to have recognized that such a claim even exists. See Garity v. APWU Nat'l Labor Org., 655 F. App'x 523, 524 (9th Cir. 2016); Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1190 (9th Cir. 2003). But even if such a claim were cognizable, it would also fail. The only facts relating to disability discrimination that Plaintiff sets forth are (1) the Navy's failure to revert her slides back to their original format in October 2010, Hill Decl. ¶ 3; (2) the Navy's delay in providing reasonable accommodations in the fall of 2012, id. at ¶ 5; and (3) Plaintiff's exclusion from meetings in September 2013, see PSUF ¶ 58; Dkt. 62-5 at 302-308, 310-315.
Defendant's conduct—as it relates to both race and disability—falls far short in both severity and frequency of creating a hostile work environment. See Manatt, 339 F.3d at 789-99 (finding no hostile work environment when coworkers used racial slurs and mocked plaintiff's pronunciation and appearance because the incidents occurred only a few times over two and a half years and were only rarely directed at plaintiff); Vasquez, 349 F.3d at 643-44 (no hostile work environment where coworker yelled at plaintiff in front of others and made two comments [*34]  over the course of a year based on racist tropes); Kortan v. Cal. Youth Auth., 217 F.3d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 2000) (no hostile work environment where supervisor, mostly on a single occasion, referred to women as "castrating bitch[es]," "Madonnas," or "Regina" in front of plaintiff).
Accordingly, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the Navy's conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment. Plaintiff has thus has failed to establish a prima facie claim, and Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the hostile work environment claim. See Vasquez, 349 F.3d at 642. The Court thus GRANTS Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's fifth cause of action.
V. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's motion for summary judgment as follows:
• The Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's first and second causes of action for discrimination on the basis of race and color.
• The Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's third cause of action for retaliation.
• The Court DENIES Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's fourth cause of action for failure to accommodate.
• The Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's [*35]  fifth cause of action for hostile work environment.
Accordingly, only Plaintiff's fourth cause of action remains before the Court.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
