CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: (IN CHAMBERS) Order GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (fld 7-30-12)
Defendant Best Buy Stores, L.P. ("Defendant" or "Best Buy") moves for summary judgment as to the action filed by Plaintiff John Alcala ("Alcala"), or partial summary adjudication on the issues discussed herein, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. (Motion for Summary Judgment or Partial Summary Judgment ("Motion"), Docket No. 28.) Alcala timely opposed the motion. (Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment ("Opp."), Docket No. 32.). Defendant timely replied. (Reply Memorandum ("Reply"), Docket No. 33.) For the following reasons, the motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Alcala brings this action following the termination of his employment at Best Buy on June 27, 2010. Alcala filed the original complaint in Riverside County Superior Court, and Defendant removed based on diversity jurisdiction. (Docket No. 1.) Alcala brings claims for 1) disability discrimination in violation of the  [*2] Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12940 et seq., and public policy; 2) retaliation for requests for accommodation in violation of FEHA and public policy; 3) retaliation for complaints of discrimination and/or harassment in violation of FEHA and public policy; 4) failure to accommodate or engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA; 5) discrimination and retaliation for taking and requesting leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq., and the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2, in violation of FEHA, FMLA, and CFRA, and public policy; 6) interference with FMLA and CFRA leave in violation of FEHA, FMLA, and CFRA, and public policy; 7) and failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, and retaliation in violation of FEHA.
Unless otherwise noted, the facts set forth herein are uncontroverted. The Court discusses further factual details in its analysis below as necessary. To the extent challenged evidence is material to the Court's decision, the objections are resolved as stated herein. Objections to evidence the Court does not rely on are immaterial, and the Court does not rule on them.  [*3] The Court does not rely on legal conclusions the parties present as facts. 1
Best Buy hired Alcala on June 15, 2005, and terminated him from his full-time sales position five  [*4] years later, on June 27, 2010. (SUF ¶ 1; Alcala Deposition ("Pl. Dep.") 26:8-10, 11:14-16; Involuntary Separation Notice, Pl. Dep. Ex. 23.) Defendant states that it terminated Alcala because his medical leave of absence, from October 26 to December 5, 2009, was unapproved and therefore counted as an unexcused absence. (Involuntary Separation Notice, Pl. Dep. Ex. 23; Motion, at 1.) Alcala asserts that this position is a pretext. (Opp., at 2.)
When Alcala was hired, Defendant furnished him with company-wide written attendance and leave policies, and Alcala understood that he had to comply or face termination. (Pl. Dep. 30:3-6, 41:15-24.) When Alcala took his leave of absence, he knew Defendant had policies regarding medical leave, that other people had taken time off for medical leave, and that the policies applied to him. (Pl. Dep. 47:4-20.) Defendant's Family and Medical Leave of Absence Policy ("FMLA Policy") sets forth that Defendant "may" require an employee to provide a medical certification as "proof of necessity" for FMLA leave. (Pl. Dep. Ex. 29, p. 6.) If Defendant requests "proof of necessity," the employee must submit the certification within fifteen days after receiving the  [*5] form or the leave begins, whichever is later. (Id.) Failure to provide "proof of necessity" may result in delay or denial of leave, and the absence may be treated as unexcused. (Id.) Defendant's California Family and Medical Leave Policy ("CFML Policy") under CFRA sets forth the same requirements. (Pl. Dep. Ex. 33, p. 3.) Defendant's "Retail Attendance/Punctuality Policy" ("Attendance Policy") provides that absences are "excused" if they are based on matters including "scheduled time off," a "work related injury," a "qualified leave of absence" under FMLA or CFRA, or "any other time off as required by local, state and federal laws." (Pl. Dep. Ex. 28, p. 1.) Unscheduled or unpredictable absenteeism is "unexecused." (Id.) If an employee has over three unexcused absences or attendance violations within six months, corrective action may include a written warning, a final warning, and involuntary termination. (Id. p. 2.)
In early October 2009, Alcala began suffering from a "ridiculous amount of back pain" rendering him unable to work. (Pl. Dep. 48:19-23; 48:24-49:2.) He showed his manager and supervisor that he had a rash, and they told him to seek medical attention. (Pl. Dep. 49:6-50:11.)  [*6] On October 5, 2009, Dr. Neal Archer diagnosed Alcala with herpes zoster (shingles). (Alcala Decl. Ex. 19, Docket No. 32-1.) Alcala's sister gave a signed doctor's note to Best Buy informing them that he would be absent for twenty days. (Alcala Decl. ¶ 12.) The note stated: "Please excuse [Alcala] from work/school/PE/Sports for 20 day(s)." (Alcala Decl. Ex. 19.)
Alcala returned on October 25, but due to pain he left work early after informing the manager, Michelle Garcia, and saw Dr. Archer again on October 26. (Pl. Dep. 56:21-24; 58:10-59:1.) Dr. Archer recommended that Alcala remain off work for another forty days, until December 5. (Pl. Dep. 200:3-11; Alcala Decl. Ex. 20; SUF ¶ 16.) Alcala's family gave his managers another signed doctor's note and his medical file at the beginning of his second leave. (Alcala Decl. ¶ 20.) The note again stated Alcala had shingles and asked for him to be excused from work for forty days. (Alcala Decl. Ex. 20.) On October 28, 2009, Garcia provided this information to Human Resources in a Leave of Absence Request, noting that Alcala sought leave for a serious medical condition, would like his leave packet delivered via UPS, and would not be working  [*7] for the duration—until December 5, 2009. (Request a Leave of Absence, Pl. Dep. Ex. 8, Docket No. 33-1.)
Alcala did not receive paperwork or other information from Best Buy before December 2009. (Pl. Dep. 136.) On December 4, Defendant mailed a request for medical certification via UPS to Alcala's address in Ontario, CA. (Medical Certification Request, Pl. Dep. Ex. 7.) Alcala, however, had moved from that address before the receiving the package, and it was not forwarded. (Pl. Dep. 136:5-16.) Defendant mailed another request to that address on January 4, 2010. (Pl. Dep. Ex. 9.) Alcala first received the package on January 21, 2010, when a manager physically gave him a copy at work. (Pl. Dep. 136:17-20.). The manager told him "to fill out this package. Just give it to your doctor and he'll go ahead and fill out the important information." (Pl. Dep. 137:20-23.) Alcala understood that it was a company requirement to complete the paperwork to qualify for FMLA and CFRA leave and that the certification would be used to verify he was absent for forty days because of a serious health condition. 2 (Pl. Dep. 138:4-6; 157:4-7, 234:19-23.) The certification form states that the health care provider  [*8] must answer every question fully and completely. (Pl. Dep. Ex. 7, p. 9.) Question 5 asks: "Will the employee be incapacitated for a single continuous period of time due to his/her medical condition, including any time for treatment and recovery?" (Id. p. 10.) If yes, the doctor must provide the "beginning and ending dates." (Id.)
On the form signed on January 27, 2010, Dr. Archer stated that Alcala's condition approximately commenced on September 30, 2009, and would last probably four months; that Alcala probably could return to work at the end of November 2009; that he "will" be incapacitated for a continuous period of time; and that no additional treatment was required as of January 27, 2010. (January Medical Certification Request, Pl. Dep. Ex. 11.) Shortly thereafter, Best Buy tried to inform Alcala that the certification had an "error." (Pl. Dep. 143:24-144:1.) Exactly what Defendant told Alcala and when is uncertain. A letter mailed to Alcala's  [*9] old address on January 29 stated that more information was necessary to determine if the FMLA leave request could be approved because Dr. Archer did not provide the "start" and "end" dates of the leave of absence. (Designation Notice, Pl. Dep. Ex. 12.) Alcala could not recall whether he had seen the notice, and it never arrived at his new address. (Pl. Dep. 144:6-9.)
Defendant gave Alcala the medical certification package approximately six times through June 2010. 3 (Pl. Dep. 145:11-18.) The packages apparently did not include a Designation Notice. In the certification submitted on April 2, 2010, Dr. Archer answered "yes" to Question 5 but did not include a duration. (Archer Dep. 41:15-21, Docket No. 32-8; Pl. Dep. Ex. 14.) Dr. Archer said he did not fill out the duration because he was filling out the form after the time of leave, despite answering "yes" to Question 5. (Archer Dep. 42:13-17.) Alcala claims he did not receive the Designation Notice sent on April 6, 2010, which detailed this deficiency. (April Designation Notice, Pl. Dep. Ex. 14.) Construing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the Court assumes that Defendant mailed the Designation Notices but Alcala  [*10] did not receive them and was not informed about the specific deficiency in Question 5. Alcala knew, however, that there was an "error" in Dr. Archer's answers. 4 Finally, in June 2010, Plaintiff's manager told him to clock out of his shift, go to the doctor's office, and fill out the form again. (Pl. Dep. 154:10-14; 178:20-23.) On the certification submitted on June 25, 2010, Dr. Archer answered "no" when asked whether Alcala "will" be incapacitated for a single continuous period of time due to his medical condition. (Pl. Dep. Ex. 16, p.4.) The estimated duration of the condition, from September 27, 2009, was 40 days—ending November 6, 2009. 5 (Id. p. 3.)
During the six months between January 2010 and his termination, Alcala was absent at least six days. (Pl. Dep. 214:10-13.) He did not obtain a doctor's note for these absences. (Pl. Dep. 226:5-227:9.) On February 28, 2010, Alcala received a written Performance Counseling Record, which he signed, stating he had been absent on January 11, 23, and 24, 2010, and February 8 and 19, 2010. (Pl. Dep. Ex. 24.) On March 6, 2010, Alcala received a second Performance Counseling Record, which he signed, stating he had an unexcused absence on March 2, 2010. (Pl. Dep. Ex. 25.) On March 20, 2010, Alcala received a final written warning, which he signed, notifying him of another unexcused absence on March 16, 2010. (Pl. Dep. Ex. 26.) On April 5, 2010, Alcala received a second final written warning, which he signed, notifying him that he was a no call/no show to an all-store meeting on April 3, 2010. (Pl. Ex. 27.)
The  [*12] Involuntary Separation Notice states that Alcala was terminated because the October 29, 2009 to December 5, 2009, leave of absence was unapproved due to failure to provide required documentation. (Pl. Dep. Ex. 23.) Defendant therefore considered the absence unexcused and in violation of its attendance policy. (Id.) Defendant also referenced the previous Performance Counseling Records provided to Alcala after his absences in 2010. (Id.)
II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate only where the record, read in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, indicates that "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Summary adjudication, or partial summary judgment "upon all or any part of [a] claim," is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact as to that portion of the claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), (b); see also Lies v. Farrell Lines, Inc., 641 F.2d 765, 769 n.3 (9th Cir. 1981) ("Rule 56 authorizes a summary adjudication that will often fall short of a final determination, even of a single  [*13] claim . . . .") (internal quotation marks omitted).
Material facts are those necessary to the proof or defense of a claim, and are determined by reference to substantive law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "[A] complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. A fact issue is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. To demonstrate a genuine issue, the opposing party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. . . . [T]he nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, "[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. Nevertheless, inferences are not drawn out of the air, and the opposing  [*14] party must produce a factual predicate from which the inference may be drawn. See Richards v. Nielsen Freight Lines, 602 F. Supp. 1224, 1244-45 (E.D. Cal. 1985), aff'd, 810 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir. 1987).
The burden initially is on the moving party to demonstrate an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. If the moving party meets its burden, then the nonmoving party must produce enough evidence to rebut the moving party's claim and create a genuine issue of material fact. See id. at 322-23. If the nonmoving party meets this burden, then the motion will be denied. Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Co., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir. 2000).
III. DISCUSSION

A. Causes of Action 1, 2, 8, and 9: Discrimination under FEHA, FMLA, CFRA, and Related Public Policy
FEHA prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of physical disabilities and medical conditions. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). In analyzing FEHA discrimination claims on summary judgment, California courts apply the burden-shifting test outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). 6 Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir. 1998);  [*15] Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (looking to federal precedent when applying California employment laws). The plaintiff meets his initial burden by establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, which requires the production of evidence that "give[s] rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination." Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). The plaintiff may satisfy his burden by proffering direct evidence of discriminatory intent. Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1220 (quoting Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994)). Although the degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case "is minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence," id. (citing Wallis, 26 F.3d at 889) (quotation marks omitted), "direct evidence of intentional discrimination is rare, and . . . such claims must usually be proved circumstantially," Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 354.
Under the McDonnell Douglas test, the plaintiff must show 1) he belongs in a protected class, 2) he was performing according to his employer's legitimate expectations, 3) he suffered an adverse employment action, and 4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive, such as other employees with qualifications similar to his own being treated more favorably. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355 (citing Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253); Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1220. The defendant may rebut the resulting presumption of discrimination by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355-56 (citations omitted). If so, the presumption of discrimination disappears and the plaintiff must attack the employer's proffered reasons as a pretext for discrimination or offer other evidence of discriminatory motive. Id. at 356 (citations omitted). Pretext cannot be shown by "merely denying the credibility of the employer's proffered reasons." Munoz v. Mabus, 630 F.3d 856, 865 (9th Cir. 2010). The plaintiff may establish pretext "'either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing  [*17] that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.'" Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1220 (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256). At this stage, "[w]hen the plaintiff offers direct evidence of discriminatory motive, a triable issue as to the actual motivation of the employer is created even when the evidence is not substantial." Id.; Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trustees, 225 F.3d 1115, 1128 (9th Cir. 2000). Where direct evidence is unavailable, however, admissible factual "evidence of 'pretense' must be 'specific' and 'substantial' in order to create a triable issue." Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1222.
1. Direct Evidence of Discrimination
Alcala argues that his direct evidence of discrimination includes his supervisors' hostility toward him after he requested disability accommodations and that "it was known among employees that Defendant disapproved [of] sick-related absences." (Opp., at 17.) This is insufficient. Direct evidence is "evidence which, if believed, proves the fact of discriminatory or retaliatory animus without inference or presumption." Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1221 (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). Direct evidence can include "clearly sexist,  [*18] racist, or similarly discriminatory statements or actions by the employer." Munoz, 630 F.3d at 865. In Chuang, direct evidence included an executive committee member stating that "two Chinks" in the pharmacology department were "more than enough," and a statement from the department chairman that the plaintiffs "should pray to [their] Buddha for help." 225 F.3d at 1128-29. In Godwin, the direct evidence of gender discrimination included a statement that the employer "did not want to deal with another female" 150 F.3d at 1221. Alcala proffers nothing comparable that shows clear discrimination because of his disability or medical condition. His characterization of Defendant's attitude after his return is subjective and unsupported by clear statements of discrimination, leaving the Court with the need to infer discrimination from other conduct. Alcala thus must make out a prima facie case of discrimination through circumstantial evidence. 7
2. Prima Facie Case of Discrimination
The Court need not resolve whether Alcala made a prima facie showing of discrimination for his termination  [*19] because in its motion, Defendant proceeded directly to the second step of McDonnell Douglas to justify its action. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 357 (declining to rule whether prima facie burden was met because issue could be resolved on proffered non-discriminatory reasons). Defendant does contend that Alcala does not establish a prima facie case for discrimination based on cessation of supervisory training. (Reply, at 23.) The Court agrees. Alcala provides no California authority, and the Court could not find any, holding that an intermediate employment action affecting some aspect of the employee's job responsibilities or conditions constitutes an adverse employment action for purposes of a discrimination claim under FEHA rather than a claim for retaliation in response to a discrimination complaint. 8 See, e.g., Akers v. County of San Diego, 95 Cal. App. 4th 1441, 1444-45, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 602 (2002) (defining ultimate employment actions as hiring, firing, failure to promote, or demotion, and establishing that intermediate employment action that has a "detrimental and substantial effect" on plaintiff's employment can constitute adverse employment action for FEHA retaliation claim).
3. Defendant's Non-Discriminatory Explanation
Defendant articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its termination of Alcala because it proffers reasons facially unrelated to prohibited bias. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 358. To be non-discriminatory, the reasons need not have been wise or even correct. Id. "[T]he ultimate issue is simply whether the employer acted with a motive to discriminate illegally." Id. Defendant provides extensive evidence, including its Attendance Policy, FMLA Policy, Alcala's submitted medical certification forms, the Designation Notices, and the Involuntary Separation Notice.  [*21] The documents show Alcala was terminated because he failed to submit a complete medical certification to confirm his leave of absence was protected under FMLA and CFRA and therefore excused. Alcala does not seriously dispute that a failure to produce adequate medical certification for a leave of absence is an innocent explanation for termination. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant meets its burden at this step.
4. Evidence to Rebut Non-Discriminatory Reasons
An employer is entitled to summary judgment if, considering its innocent explanation for its actions, the evidence as a whole is insufficient to permit a rational inference that the employer's actual motive was discriminatory. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 361. A rational inference of discrimination may be created "either by directly persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256; Chuang, 225 F.3d at 1122. Showing the decision was wrong or mistaken does not show pretext. McKinney v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 641 F. Supp. 2d 962, 973 (C.D. Cal. 2009). The plaintiff must demonstrate "such  [*22] weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence, . . . and hence infer that the employer did not act for the [. . . asserted] non-discriminatory reasons." Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal. App.4th 52, 75, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000) (citation omitted). Circumstantial evidence must be "specific and substantial." Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1222.
Alcala argues the proffered reasons are pretext because a) the reasons for the termination are false, b) Defendant caused the problem it fired Alcala for, c) Defendant made discriminatory statements and acted in a discriminatory manner, d) Defendant treated similarly-situated persons more favorably, and e) the discharge occurred shortly after Alcala returned. (Opp., at 18-20.) The Court concludes Alcala does not meet his burden of showing pretext.
a. Defendant's Reasons for Termination are False
Alcala's claims the "unexecused absenteeism" justification is "absolutely false." (Opp., at 18.) First, even assuming Defendant lied about its reasons for terminating Alcala, that cannot save the discrimination  [*23] claim. "[A]n inference of intentional discrimination cannot be drawn solely from evidence, if any, that the company lied about its reasons. The pertinent statutes do not prohibit lying, they prohibit discrimination." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 360-61 (citing St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 521, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)). The Involuntary Separation Notice states that Alcala was terminated because his forty-day absence in 2009 was unexcused because he failed to provide a completed medical certification. (Pl. Dep. Ex. 23.) The form also references Alcala's subsequent unexcused absences through April 2010. Alcala merely relies on Defendant's alternative argument that the additional unexcused absences qualify as additional grounds for termination, which is not an inconsistency supporting a triable issue of pretext.
Second, Alcala claims he provided a "facially valid certification"—Dr. Archer's October 26, 2009 note—and that Defendant does not require FMLA paperwork to approve medical leaves. (Opp., at 18-19.) As to the latter contention, Alcala's only evidence is Michael Joseph's declaration that he took a leave of absence from Best Buy to take care of a family member, notified Human Resources of  [*24] the leave, and was not asked for paperwork. (Joseph Decl. ¶ 10; Docket No. 32-9.) The statement does not indicate the leave's duration, when it occurred, or whether Joseph provided Human Resources with a valid certification at the outset, so there is no reasonable basis for a factfinder to conclude that Joseph was similarly situated to Alcala. Further, although Defendant's policy does not require FMLA paperwork, the employee must submit it if requested. (FMLA Policy, Pl. Dep. Ex. 26, p. 6.) Thus, Alcala offers no evidence sufficient to create a reasonable inference of pretext or discriminatory animus on this basis.
Further, Dr. Archer's note is not a "facially valid certification" as a matter of law. Under FMLA and CFRA, an employer may require an employee to support a leave request with a certification issued by his healthcare provider. 29 U.S.C. § 2613(a); Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(k); 2 Cal. Code Reg. § 7297.4(b)(2). A certification is sufficient if it includes a) the date the "serious health condition" commenced; b) the probable duration of the condition; and c) a statement that, due to the "serious health condition," the employee is unable to perform the functions of his position.  [*25] Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(k)(1); see also 29 U.S.C. § 2613(a). A "serious health condition" means an illness or physical or mental condition which involves either inpatient care (on overnight stay) in a hospital or "continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider." 2 Cal. Code Reg. § 7297.0(o); see also 29 U.S.C. § 2611(11). The serious health condition should involve a period of incapacity, such as inability to work or perform other regular daily activities, of more than three consecutive calendar days. Gibbs v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 1, 8, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 554 (1999). An employer may use a certification form of its own choosing, such as California's model or an equivalent like the United States Department of Labor Form WH-380 utilized by Defendant. See Cal. Code Reg. § 7297.11; Pl. Ex. 7. A certification is insufficient if "the information provided is vague, ambiguous, or non-responsive." 29 C.F.R. § 825.305(c).
Dr. Archer's October 29 note is titled "Patient Discharge Instructions." (Alcala Decl. Ex. 20.) Under the heading "Instruction Sheet(s) to be Provided," Dr. Archer wrote "herpes zooster." He wrote nothing under the headings "Follow Up Instructions" or "Additional  [*26] Discharge Instructions (Including Work/Activity Restrictions)." Under the heading "Excuse From Work/School," Dr. Archer requested that Alcala be excused for forty days. (Id.) Unlike California's model form, see 2 Cal. Code Reg. § 7297.11, Dr. Archer's note does not state the probable duration of the medical condition, whether Alcala's condition is a "serious health condition" under the FMLA or CFRA, how it will impact his daily routine, whether he cannot perform work of any kind, or whether he cannot perform any essential functions of his position. A request to be excused from work, in itself, does not establish "incapacity." See Gibbs, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 8 (1999) ("Absence from work does not establish "incapacity."). Thus, regardless of how Garcia interpreted Alcala's request when she informed Human Resources, (see Request a Leave of Absence, Pl. Dep. Ex. 8), the note is not a "facially valid certification." At most it put Defendant on notice that the leave might be covered by FMLA and CFRA, and that it had the right to inquire further to determine whether the absences were likely to qualify for FMLA protection. 9 Bachelder v. Am. West Airlines, Inc., 259 F.3d 1112, 1131 (9th Cir. 2001)  [*27] (noting employer's responsibility for determining if leave qualifies under FMLA upon being notified of reason for employee's absence).
b. Defendant Caused the Issue
Alcala claims Defendant's alleged violation of CFRA notice regulations prejudiced him and thus shows pretext. (Opp., at 19-20.) Alcala offers no specific or substantial evidence that Defendant's delay in mailing the certification forms and failure to send the Designation Notices to his new address were done  [*28] with discriminatory animus. Competent evidence shows that Defendant repeatedly attempted to send Alcala the forms via UPS, beginning on December 4, 2009. (E.g., Medical Certification Request, Pl. Dep. Ex. 7.) The documents were not sent from Alcala's store, and Alcala's managers did not review the certifications. (See id. (instructing Alcala to contact "Megan," a Leave of Absence Caseworker and to fax completed certification to telephone number in 952 area code).) Unlike in Edwards v. Hodel, 738 F. Supp. 426 (D. Co. 1990), where the court found that the employer discriminated against the plaintiff, who was black, because the deciding factor for a vacancy was detail experience only available to nonblack employees, Alcala proffers no evidence indicating that Defendant did not update his address, send paperwork immediately after his leave began, or reject his paperwork because of his illness. Thus, the Court finds there is no evidence suggesting these actions stemmed from discriminatory animus or was pretextual. 10
c. Defendant's Discriminatory Conduct  [*29] and Statements
As the Court noted earlier, Alcala offers no evidence clearly demonstrating that discriminatory animus toward his medical condition was the reason for his termination. Alcala does not offer new evidence to rebut Defendant's legitimate reason for his termination on this ground and thus fails to meet his burden.
d. Unequal Treatment
Alcala claims he presents a triable issue of pretext because Defendant did not write up employees it favored for calling out before a shift and Alcala was not written up before his disability leave. (Opp., at 18.) For such evidence to be probative of discriminatory motive, a plaintiff must show "the employer treated 'similarly situated' employees more favorably than the plaintiff." McKinney, 641 F. Supp. 2d at 974 (quoting Josephs v. Pacific Bell, 443 F.3d 1050, 1065 (9th Cir. 2006)). In McKinney, the court held that the plaintiffs had not met their burden because the evidence did not show that non-black employees were not working full hours but not being investigated, unlike black employees, and nothing created an inference that white employees were otherwise violating work rules without discipline. Id. at 974-75. Alcala provides no competent  [*30] evidence that other employees who went on comparable leaves of absence were not asked to complete medical certification forms or not told to resubmit incomplete forms. Alcala also provides no competent evidence that employees who did not go on extended leaves of absence before 2010—the relevant time frame—and then called out sick without providing a doctor's note or called out for an unexcused reason were not written up by management. Alcala's only support for his contention that no other employees were written up after his return is his statement that "several other employees . . . told me they have never been written up for calling out during that same time frame." (Alcala Decl. ¶ 47.) This statement is inadmissible hearsay and the Court does not consider it on a motion for summary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2); Beyene v. Coleman Sec. Servs., Inc., 854 F.2d 1179, 1181 (9th Cir. 1988) ("It is well settled that only admissible evidence may be considered by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment."). Accordingly, Alcala fails to provide probative evidence of discrimination based on unequal treatment.
e. Timing Shows Pretext
Lastly, Alcala claims pretext may  [*31] be inferred from the timing of his discharge. (Opp., at 20.) "Pretext may be inferred from the timing of the discharge decision, the identity of the decisionmaker, or by the discharged employee's job performance before termination." Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 224, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999) (citing Flait v. N. Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal. App. 4th 467, 476, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992)). In Flait, the court held that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the articulated performance reasons for terminating the plaintiff's employment were pretextual because the sole person charged with the decision to terminate the plaintiff had made derogatory sexual remarks to other individuals and was confronted by the plaintiff only four months earlier, no one could recall looking at the plaintiff's sales or other records before terminating his employment, and the plaintiff had increased sales substantially immediately prior to his employment. 3 Cal. App. 4th at 479-80.
Comparably, Alcala was terminated six months after he returned from his leave, six months after Defendant first requested completed certification forms, five months after Dr. Archer first sent an incomplete form, and two months after Alcala's last  [*32] write up for an unexcused absence. More importantly, Alcala was terminated two days after submitting at least his third incomplete medical certification, which had information inconsistent with Dr. Archer's previous submission. (See Pl. Dep. Ex. 16.) Defendant's Human Resources Support Center drafted the Involuntary Separation Notice, not Alcala's supervisors. (King Dep. 165:6-19.) Further, unlike in Flait, Defendant does not cite performance as the reason for Alcala's termination, and Alcala provides no evidence that Defendant did not review his records and the FMLA forms before his discharge. Thus, neither the temporal proximity of months nor the circumstances leading up to the termination could allow a reasonable jury to infer pretext.
Therefore, the Court concludes that Alcala has not satisfied his burden of rebutting Defendant's legitimate reason for his termination. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the first cause of action and the eighth cause of action to the extent it is predicated on a discrimination claim.
5. Public Policy Claims
"The tort cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy provides a vehicle for recourse that otherwise  [*33] would be unavailable under general rules of the at-will employment doctrine." Phillips v. St. Mary Reg'l Med. Ctr., 96 Cal. App. 4th 218, 225, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 770 (2002). "[T]his public policy exception allows an employee to bring a tort cause of action against an employer who terminates an at-will employment on a ground that violates fundamental public policy." Id. at 226. The discrimination claims in violation of public policy rise and fall on whether Alcala has a viable claim under FEHA, FMLA, and CFRA. McKinney, 641 F. Supp. 2d at 982; see also Stevenson v. Superior Court, 16 Cal. 4th 880, 909, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157(1997) (holding that FEHA's prohibition of age discrimination could provide the basis for former employee's wrongful termination claim). Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the second cause of action and the ninth cause of action to the extent it is predicated on a discrimination claim.

B. Causes of Action 3, 4, 5, 6: Retaliation Under FEHA and Related Public Policy
To make a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation, the plaintiff must show 1) he engaged in a protected activity, 2) he suffered an adverse employment action, and 3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the employer's  [*34] action, such as the employer's knowledge that the employee engaged in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected action and the allegedly retaliatory employment decision. Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005) (citations omitted). To establish causation, the plaintiff must show "by a preponderance of the evidence that engaging in the protected activity was one of the reasons for [the adverse employment action] and that but for such activity [he] would not have [suffered that adverse action]." Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1064-65 (9th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the employer must offer a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. If so, the presumption of retaliation is overcome and the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove intentional retaliation. Id. The same evidentiary standards generally apply as in the discrimination context. Munoz, 630 F.3d at 865; McKinney, 641 F. Supp. 2d at 976 n.14.
FEHA's nonretaliatory provision, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h), prohibits an employer from discharging, expelling,  [*35] or otherwise discriminating against any person "because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." See Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042-43. Thus, Alcala's first "protected activity"—his request for disability accommodations—is not a FEHA-protected activity and cannot be the basis for this action. See Flait, 3 Cal. App. 4th at 476 (discussing need for employee to raise discrimination or harassment issue or oppose such activities as first step in analysis). The only potential FEHA-protected activities, therefore, are Alcala's alleged complaints about the unfair treatment he was receiving after returning from his leave. (Opp., at 21.)
"Standing alone, an employee's unarticulated belief that an employer is engaged in discrimination will not suffice to establish protected conduct for the purpose of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation, where there is no evidence the employer knew that the employee's opposition [to an action] was based upon a reasonable belief that the employer was engaging in discrimination." Yanowitz, 36 Cal. App. 4th at 1046. The employee need  [*36] not file a formal complaint or use magic words, but "complaints about personal grievances or vague or conclusory remarks that fail to put an employer on notice as to what conduct it should investigate will not suffice to establish protected conduct." Id. at 1047-48; Garcia-Paz v. Swift Textiles, Inc., 873 F. Supp. 547, 560 (D. Kan. 1995) ("Employees often do not speak with the clarity or precision of lawyers. At the same time, however, employers need not approach every employee's comment as a riddle, puzzling over the possibility that it contains a cloaked complaint of discrimination.") In Yanowitz, the court concluded that a trier of fact could find that the employer knew the plaintiff's refusal to comply with an order to fire a sales associate was based on a belief that the order constituted sex discrimination. 36 Cal. App. 4th at 1048. The employer often directed the plaintiff to fire an associate he thought was insufficiently attractive and once pointed to an attractive woman while indicating his preference to hire an associate who looked like her. Id. The court reasoned that the plaintiff's refusal to implement the directive and his repeated requests for "adequate justification"  [*37] for the order should have put the employer on notice as to the discriminatory conduct. Id. In Lelaind v. City of San Francisco, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1095 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (holding that protected actions included giving deposition testimony in connection with discrimination lawsuit, participating in anti-discrimination protest, and complaining about discrimination in meeting with supervisors).
Under the Yanowitz standard, simply airing a grievance complaining about or opposing a decision, without more, cannot amount to a protected activity. Unlike the statements in Yanowitz, Alcala provides no evidence that he aired his concerns in a manner that a reasonable jury could conclude put Defendant on notice that Alcala believed his cut hours and cessation of supervisory training—the two issues Alcala complained about—were due to unlawful discrimination rather than a personal grievance. (See, e.g., Pl. Dep. 84:12-85:12 (acknowledging he asked why he was being scheduled for less hours but not offering statements implying it was due to discrimination); Pl. Dep. 95-96 (same, and admitting that managers restored hours each time); Pl. Dep. 292:5-13, 294:13-18 (stating he asked supervisors "why"  [*38] he was not getting training and they gave him "legitimate criticisms," such as problems with task delegation).) Therefore, because Alcala's complaints do not amount to protected activity as a matter of law, Defendant is entitled to judgment on Alcala's retaliation claims under FEHA and related public policy.

C. Cause of Action 12: Failure to Prevent Harassment and Discrimination in Violation of FEHA
There is no independent claim for "failure to investigate or prevent discrimination or harassment" absent an underlying claim of actual discrimination or harassment under FEHA. Trujillo v. N. County Trans. Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 288-89, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998) ("[T]here's no logic that says an employee who has not been discriminated against can sue an employer for not prevent discrimination that didn't happen, for not having a policy to prevent discrimination when no discrimination occurred."). Because the Court holds that Alcala's discrimination and retaliation claims under FEHA fail as a matter of law, Alcala cannot maintain an action for failure to prevent harassment and discrimination. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this claim.

D. Cause of Action 7: Failure to  [*39] Accommodate or Engage in Good Faith Interactive Process
Alcala claims Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate his disability or engage in a good faith interactive process. (Opp., at 22.) Specifically, Alcala argues that although Defendant "was able to accommodate" his leave, "Defendant failed to interact in good faith when" it "never gave [Alcala] a fair opportunity to comply with" the request for certification. (Id.) This claim fails as a matter of law.
FEHA requires employers to reasonably accommodate an employee's known physical disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m); Scotch v. Art Inst. of Ca.—Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1003 (2009). FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n); Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1003. An employer fails to provide a reasonable accommodation when a) the plaintiff has a disability under FEHA, b) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and c) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate  [*40] the disability. Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1009-10 (citing Wilson v. County of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009)). "Reasonable accommodations" include [j]ob restructuring, reassignment to a vacant position, [or] part-time or modified work schedules," 2 Cal. Code Reg. § 7293.9(a), or "a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired," Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1010 (citation omitted). The interactive process required by FEHA is "an informal process with the employee . . . to attempt to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013 (quoting Wilson, 169 Cal. App. 4th at 1195)). An employer fails to engage in an interactive process when a) a reasonable accommodation would have been possible, and b) the employer is responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process. Williams v. Genentech, Inc., 139 Cal. App. 4th 357, 381-82, 42 Cal. Rptr. 3d 585 (2006).
These standards show that FEHA's accommodation and interactive process provisions have nothing to do with offering an employee a "fair opportunity" to comply with a request  [*41] for certification. Rather, they focus on ensuring the employee's work conditions are adjusted to address a disability, where possible. Thus, as a matter of law, Defendant could not have violated FEHA through its conduct regarding the certifications, which did not effect Alcala's ability to perform his job duties effectively despite his medical condition. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Alcala's seventh cause of action. 11

D. Causes of Action 10, 11: FMLA/CFRA Interference
The FMLA (and thus CFRA) prohibits interference with the exercise of an employee's right to take a protected leave, such as by impermissibly denying an employee's entitlement to FMLA leave. Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1132 (9th Cir. 2003). Generally, an employer should request that an employee furnish certification at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave or within five business days thereafter, although the employer may request certification later if there is reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration. 29 C.F.R. § 825.305(b). An employer may deny FMLA coverage for requested leave if the employee fails to provide a certification within 15 calendar days from receipt of the request. Id. § 825.313(b).  [*43] If an employee submits a complete and sufficient certification, the employer may not request additional information from the health care provider. Id. § 825.307(a). An employer must advise an employee whenever the employer finds a certification incomplete or insufficient, such as when it is vague, ambiguous, or non-responsive, and must state in writing what additional information is necessary to make the certification complete and sufficient. Id. § 825.305(c). CFRA imposes comparable requirements on employers. See 2 Cal. Code Reg. § 7297.0 et seq. "An employer's good faith or lack of knowledge that its conduct violates FMLA does not protect it from liability." Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1130.
A failure to notify an employee of his rights under FMLA can constitute interference if it affects his rights under FMLA, although there is no relief unless the employee was prejudiced by the violation. Liu, 347 F.3d at 1134-35; Mora v. Chem-Tronics, 16 F. Supp. 2d 1192, 1227 (S.D. Cal. 1998). Logically, it follows that a failure to notify an employee of the specific deficiency in an FMLA medical certification form constitutes interference if it results in the denial of the employee's request for protected  [*44] leave. Cf. Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 881, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007) ("[Employer's] failure to establish it complied with an employer's obligations under the CFRA precludes it from obtaining summary judgment with respect to [plaintiff's CFRA interference] claims."). It is undisputed that Defendant did not send certification forms to Alcala until at least December 4, 2009, right when his leave ended, and the evidence indicates that Alcala did not receive any form until late January. Regardless of whether Alcala knew he may be asked for a certification, the burden was on Defendant to provide the forms. See Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1131 (stating that once employer was on notice that leave might be covered by CFRA, it was obligated to inquire further to determine whether absence was likely to qualify for CFRA protection).
There also is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Alcala was ever aware of the deficiencies in the certifications submitted by Dr. Archer. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the Court finds there is a disputed issue as to whether Alcala ever received the Designation Notices detailing the problems in Dr. Archer's answers  [*45] to Question 5, either in the mail or in the packages given to Alcala by his supervisors at work. Simply put, there is a triable issue as to whether Defendant advised its employee "in writing what additional information is necessary to make the certification complete and sufficient." 29 C.F.R. § 825.305(c). Although Defendant lawfully could consider Alcala's failure to submit a completed form in making its decision to terminate him, there is no evidence that Alcala willfully failed to cooperate. See Bailey v. Sw. Gas Co., 275 F.3d 1181, 1186 (9th Cir. 2002) (upholding summary judgment for employer where employee's certification was not complete and employee repeatedly refused to submit complete information even though employer informed her why certification was incomplete). Because a reasonable jury could conclude that Alcala did not receive the Designation Notices and the notification failure prejudiced Alcala, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on Alcala's causes of action for interference.

E. Causes of Action 8, 9: FMLA/CFRA Retaliation Claims
The elements of a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of CFRA are 1) the defendant was an employer covered by CFRA, 2) the  [*46] plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave, 3) the plaintiff exercised his right to take leave for a CFRA qualifying purpose, and 4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse action, such as termination, because of his exercise of his right to CFRA leave. Dudley v. Dep't of Transp., 90 Cal. App. 4th 255, 261, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 739 (2001) (adapting FMLA prima facie case of retaliation, which requires plaintiff to show he availed himself of protected right under FMLA, was adversely affected by employment decision, and a causal connection between the protected activity and adverse employment action) (citations omitted). Temporal proximity between a protected action and the alleged retaliatory employment decision may establish causation. Lelaind, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 1099 (citation omitted). A prima facie retaliation claim under FMLA and CFRA is not predicated on an employer's subjective belief that the absences were not protected under FMLA or CFRA because the employee failed to provide a valid physician's certification. See Avila v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1259-60, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008) (discussing Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 884-85, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007)). In Faust, the employee was  [*47] discharged because the human resources manager determined that the doctor's certification was "insufficient to sustain an approved absence from work" and therefore the employee's absence was not protected leave under CFRA. 150 Cal. App. 4th at 872. The court held that the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of CFRA retaliation because he "presented evidence that he was entitled to leave under CFRA, he availed himself of that right, and [he] was terminated for taking leave to which he was entitled." Id. at 885.
Because a trier of fact could find that Defendant's actions "formed a pattern of systematic retaliation," Yanowitz, 36 Cal. App. 4th at 1055, the Court finds that Alcala has presented a prima facie case of retaliation for taking protected leave based on his termination, cessation of supervisory training, cut hours, and write-ups for subsequent absences. Although Alcala's claims for retaliation based on his discharge fail as a matter of law for the reasons discussed in the Court's analysis of the discrimination causes of action, see Faust, 150 Cal. App. 4th at 872 (applying burden-shifting analysis to CFRA retaliation claim), 12 Defendant offers no legitimate reasons for  [*48] its other conduct and therefore there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant unlawfully retaliated against Alcala by virtue of its other actions. Accordingly, the Court only grants summary judgment to Defendant on the eighth and ninth causes of action to the extent they are predicated on Alcala's termination. The Court denies summary judgment to the extent these causes of action are predicated on Defendant's other conduct.
IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS partial summary judgment to the Defendant on Alcala's first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and twelfth causes of action. The Court also GRANTS partial summary judgment to Defendant on Alcala's eighth and ninth causes of action to the extent they are predicated on discrimination or termination-based retaliation. The Court DENIES summary judgment to Defendant on the tenth and eleventh causes of action and the remaining retaliation claims in the eighth and ninth causes of action.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
