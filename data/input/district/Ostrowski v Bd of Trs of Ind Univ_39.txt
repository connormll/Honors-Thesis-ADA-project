Opinion



Order on Motions for Summary Judgment (ECF Nos. 42, 44)
Plaintiff and former academic appointee Nancy Ostrowski sued the Board of Trustees of Indiana University ("IU") under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, alleging that the University failed to accommodate her disability. The parties each move for summary judgment. (ECF Nos. 42, 44.) Because genuine issues of material fact remain, the motions are denied.

I. Legal Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate if "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears the initial burden of production. Modrowski v. Pigatto, 712 F.3d 1166, 1168 (7th Cir. 2013). That initial burden consists of either "(1) showing that there is an absence of evidence supporting an essential element of the non-moving party's claim; or (2) presenting affirmative evidence that negates an essential element [*2]  of the non-moving party's claim." Hummel v. St. Joseph Cnty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 817 F.3d 1010, 1016 (7th Cir. 2016) (citing Modrowski, 712 F.3d at 1169). If the movant discharges its initial burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party, who must present evidence sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact on all essential elements of his case. See Lewis v. CITGO Petroleum Corp., 561 F.3d 698, 702 (7th Cir. 2009). "The ordinary standards for summary judgment remain unchanged on cross-motions for summary judgment: [the Court] construe[ s] all facts and inferences arising from them in favor of" the non-moving party. Blow v. Bijora, Inc., 855 F.3d 793, 797 (7th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted).

II. Background
Nancy Ostrowski began working at IU as a contractor in the winter of 2015. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 43:24-44:5, ECF No. 42-2.) On February 2, 2016, Ostrowski became the associate director of IU's Kinsey Institute, a research institute on human sexuality. (Id. at 49:1-5.) The associate directorship was a new academic appointment position, one which was set to end on June 30, 2019, unless it was renewed—it ultimately was not. (Pavalko Decl. ¶¶ 6, 12, ECF No. 42-16; Apr. 10, 2018 Letter, ECF No. 42-14.) Sue Carter, Director of the Kinsey Institute, was Ostrowski's direct supervisor. (Carter Decl. ¶¶ 6, 7, ECF No. 42-9.) In turn, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research ("OVPR") oversees the Kinsey [*3]  Institute. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 55:6-8, ECF No. 42-2.) While Ostrowski worked at the Kinsey Institute, Rick Van Kooten was the Vice Provost for Research. (Pavalko Dep. Tr. 13:15-19, ECF No. 42-5.)
Ostrowski had previously undergone two open heart surgeries in 2010 and 2015 to address a defective aortic valve. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 24:24-26:22, ECF No. 42-2.) The second of these surgeries left her with "extreme fatigue" and "extreme difficulty with [her] memory," (id. at 26:7-8, 27:11-12), which had led to her retirement from her previous high-stakes job at Eli Lilly & Company, (id. at 27:3-16). After the surgeries, Ostrowski had difficulty walking, among other impairments, and her doctor instructed her to avoid walking in temperatures above 80 degrees or below 40 degrees. (Id. at 113:21-114:1; Carter Decl. ¶ 8, ECF No. 42-9.)
Due to her heart condition, Ostrowski sought various accommodations from IU once she started working there. She asked Carter for a larger computer screen to accommodate vision problems, which Carter granted. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 41:5-25, ECF No. 42-2.) She and Carter also signed a Memorandum of Understanding reflecting an arrangement for flexible work hours to allow [*4]  for delays caused by Ostrowski's medical conditions or absences caused by her frequent doctor's appointments. (Mem. Understanding, ECF No. 42-21.) Carter interpreted this memorandum to permit Ostrowski to work from home in the event of illness or other medical issue. (Carter Dep. Tr. 21:9-14, ECF No. 42-4.) Ostrowski also obtained a disabled parking permit, which allowed her to park in any disabled parking space on campus. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 63:3-20, ECF No. 42-2; Carter Decl. ¶ 8, ECF No. 42-9.)
When Ostrowski began working there, the Kinsey Institute was located at Morrison Hall. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 62:24-63:2, ECF No. 42-2.) Ostrowski would park in one of several disabled parking spaces immediately behind Morrison Hall. (Carter Decl. ¶ 8, ECF No. 42-9; Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 63:3-6, ECF No. 42-2.) But, in 2016, IU began to look for a larger space to house the Kinsey Institute. (Carter Decl. ¶ 11, ECF No. 42-9.) The Kinsey Institute was to officially move to Lindley Hall starting July 9, 2018. (Carter Decl. ¶ 13, ECF No. 42-9.) Lindley Hall is part of an older area of campus, and it is one of several buildings that were designed and built in the era of horse-and-buggy traffic. (Morrison [*5]  Dep. Tr. 16:7-12, ECF No. 42-26.) Consequently, Lindley Hall and other buildings in the vicinity are "essentially landlocked." (Morrison Decl. ¶ 3, ECF No. 42-12.) The only road close to Lindley Hall is a drive that IU has designated as an "emergency vehicle and fire lane" serving Lindley Hall, the Chemistry Building, and two other buildings nearby. (Id.) There are no parking spaces immediately adjacent to Lindley Hall. (Morrison Dep. Tr. 15:24-16:5, ECF No. 42-26.) The closest existing disabled parking spaces are in a lot adjacent to Wylie Hall and a lot adjacent to Owen Hall. (Turnipseed Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 42-18; Turnipseed Dep. Tr. 16:15-17:1, ECF No. 42-27.) Ostrowski says she called the Office of Parking Operations in mid-June to ask for handicapped parking at Lindley Hall and was told there were none immediately next to the building and "there won't be any." (Ostrowski Dep. 104:25-105:14, ECF No. 42-2.)
That brings us to the three days that form the basis of this case. The morning of July 9, 2018—the first day of the Kinsey's Institute's relocation to Lindley Hall—Ostrowski parked in a service-vehicle spot outside Wylie Hall. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 109:3-21, ECF No. 42-2.) The temperature [*6]  was in the 90s. (Id. at 110:11-12.) Having not attempted the walk from Wylie Hall to Lindley Hall before, (Id. at 114:15), Ostrowski began to walk up a hill toward her new office. (Id. at 111:13-23.) It proved to be extremely difficult for her. She stopped and started multiple times, sweated profusely, had a hard time catching her breath, and "felt sick to [her] stomach." (Id. at 111:15-21, 112:20-24.) She experienced symptoms of heart failure: "aberrant" EKG readings as shown by a portable heart monitor, shortness of breath, chest pain, hip pain, and heart palpitations. (Id. at 121:22-122:6.) After finally arriving at Lindley Hall, Ostrowski complained to Carter about her parking situation and the symptoms she experienced during and after the walk. (Carter Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, ECF No. 42-9.)
Ostrowski wanted to avoid doing that walk again. At the end of the work day, Ostrowski went to the Office of Parking Operations and spoke with its Director, Amanda Turnipseed, about obtaining a disabled parking space closer to Lindley Hall. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 116:25-117:21, ECF No. 42-2; Turnipseed Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 42-18.) Turnipseed informed her that the closest disabled parking spaces were the ones [*7]  next to Wylie Hall and Owen Hall. (Turnipseed Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 42-18.) Ostrowski said those spots were inadequate and that she wanted a parking spot on the road by Lindley Hall, but Turnipseed told her that the Office of Parking Operations had no authority to create new parking spots and that, in any event, the road Ostrowski referred to was a fire lane. (Id.) Acting on a tip from Turnipseed, Ostrowski then called the office of Tom Morrison, IU's Vice President of Capital Planning and Facilities. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 119:21-120:2, ECF No. 42-2.) An executive assistant in the office, Richard Lewis, answered and, in response to Ostrowski's request for parking next to Lindley Hall, reiterated where the closest spots were and said that the University prohibited parking in the fire lane. (Id. at 119:21-120:19; Morrison Dep. Tr. 23:22-24:25, 27:17-28:21, ECF No. 42-26.) Lewis relayed Ostrowski's parking issue to Morrison that day. (Morrison Dep. Tr. 21:7-15, ECF No. 42-26.)
The morning of July 10, 2018, Ostrowski parked in a disabled parking space next to Owen Hall. (Turnipseed Decl. ¶ 7, ECF No. 42-18.) Again, the temperature was in the 90s. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 129:10-130:11, ECF No. 42-2.) [*8]  Still dogged by some of the fatigue and heart problems spurred by the previous morning's walk,1 Ostrowski again walked up the inclining path toward Lindley Hall. (Id. at 130:12-23.) Carter joined her on the walk to observe. (Carter Dep. Tr. 48:5-6, ECF No. 42-4.) Again, Ostrowski experienced symptoms of heart failure. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 131:1-6, ECF No. 42-2.)
That same morning, Turnipseed emailed Julie Bauters, Supervisor of Auxillary Business Services, and Munirpallam Venkataramanan, an assistant to Provost Lauren Robel, about Ostrowski's parking situation. (July 10, 2018 Email, ECF No. 42-28; Turnipseed Dep. Tr. 18:9-19:21, ECF No. 42-27.) Venkataramanan in turn forwarded Turnipseed's email to Vice Provost for Research Van Kooten, who replied that OVPR was "also just as surprised that [Ostrowski] can't walk even that short distance" from Owen Hall to Lindley Hall. (July 10, 2018 Email, ECF No. 44-2 at 37-38.) In the afternoon, Turnipseed emailed Ostrowski to ask how the walk from Owen Hall had been; Ostrowski said it had "seriously exacerbated [her] symptoms" and that she was discussing accommodations with Carter. (Turnipseed Decl. ¶ 7, ECF No. 42-18.) Ostrowski added that she would [*9]  appreciate further assistance finding parking closer to Lindley Hall. (Id.)
On July 11, 2018, having not obtained any parking space closer to Lindley Hall, Ostrowski once again braved the walk from the disabled parking spaces outside Owen Hall to her office. And, again, she experienced symptoms of heart failure. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 140:16-17, ECF No. 42-2.)
On none of these days did Ostrowski directly contact the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs (OVPFAA), headed by Eliza Pavalko, to request a new accommodation. (Pavalko Decl. ¶ 10, ECF No. 42-16; Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 118:9-119:20, ECF No. 42-2.) The OVPFAA is IU's "point of contact for any faculty and academic appointees for assistance on many employment-related issues," including "ADA and medical-related accommodations for faculty and employees with academic positions or appointments." (Pavalko Decl. ¶ 3, ECF No. 42-16.) Ostrowski had been directed to the OVPFAA in the past. (See Sep. 24, 2015 Email, ECF No. 42-11; Mar. 12, 2018 Email, ECF No. 42-24; Mar. 13, 2018 Email, ECF No. 42-25; Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 89:14-90:8, ECF No. 42-2.) She had even met with Pavalko, who had told her about the general process at the [*10]  OVPFAA for requesting accommodations, in March of 2018. (Pavalko Decl. ¶ 8, ECF No. 42-16.)
July 11, 2018, proved to be the last day Ostrowski would go to work at the Kinsey Institute. On July 12, Ostrowski worked from home but does not remember whether she got any work done. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 144:7-18, ECF No. 42-2.) After having Carter deliver her work computer while she waited in her car in a parking lot, (id. at 152:14-22), Ostrowski followed Carter's recommendation and met with Sherry Knighton-Schwandt, Assistant Vice Provost for Research at the OVPR, (id. at 144:23-146:3). Ostrowski discussed the parking and medical issues she was having. (Id.) Knighton-Schwandt suggested Ostrowski speak with Human Resources ("HR"). (Id.) Heeding that advice, Ostrowski headed toward the HR building and ran into HR employee Frank Epperson, who specialized in ADA issues. (Ostrowski Notes, ECF No. 42-32 at 4). After Ostrowski explained her situation to him, Epperson gave her contact information for the OVPFAA. (Id.)
On July 13, 2018, Ostrowski saw her physician, who believed that continuing to work in any capacity would exacerbate the symptoms of heart failure she had developed over the course of [*11]  the first three days of that week; her doctor thus recommended that Ostrowski take a three-month medical leave of absence. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 163:3-7, ECF No. 42-2).
On July 16, 2018, Knighton-Schwandt called Assistant Vice Provost Susan McCammon of the OVPFAA to explain Ostrowski's situation. (Pavalko Decl. ¶ 11, ECF No. 42-16.) Only then did the OVPFAA finally learn about Ostrowski's problems. (Id.) Pavalko approved Ostrowski's request for medical leave. (Id. ¶ 12). Pavalko and the OVPFAA began to develop options to accommodate Ostrowski in the event that she returned from medical leave. (Pavalko Decl. ¶ 13, ECF No. 42-16.) And Ostrowski herself remained hopeful, for a time, that her physical condition would improve. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 183:9-16, ECF No. 42-2.) But that did not happen. According to Ostrowski, the damage from the three walks from July 9 to July 11 was done—she describes her health as having "fall[en] off of a cliff," and she was no longer able to attend to basic household chores. (Id. at 166:6-167:2.) Ostrowski alleges and has testified that she became permanently disabled from working after those three days in July. (Compl. ¶ 24, ECF No. 1; Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 173:12-174:24, [*12]  194:2-9, ECF No. 42-2.) Ostrowski's medical leave was eventually extended through the end of her academic appointment at the Kinsey Institute. (Apr. 2, 2019 Letter, ECF No. 42-41.) She never returned to work, at IU or otherwise. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 194:8-9, ECF No. 42-2.)
Ultimately, Ostrowski filed suit against IU, bringing a failure to accommodate claim under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The parties each move for summary judgment. (ECF Nos. 42, 44.)

III. Discussion
To succeed on her failure to accommodate claim under 29 U.S.C. § 794, Ostrowski must show (1) that she was a qualified individual with a disability, (2) that IU was aware of her disability, and (3) that IU failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. See Sansone v. Brennan, 917 F.3d 975, 979 (7th Cir. 2019) (citing King v. City of Madison, 550 F.3d 598, 600 (7th Cir. 2008)).2 Addressing each element in turn, the Court finds that Ostrowski has adduced enough evidence to avert summary judgment for IU, but that this evidence is not so incontrovertible as to warrant summary judgment for her.

A. Qualified Individual with a Disability
A qualified individual is one "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). IU does not dispute that Ostrowski was a qualified individual [*13]  with a disability. But the Court pauses on this prong to note that, once Ostrowski took a medical leave of absence, she was no longer a qualified individual for purposes of her failure to accommodate claim. That is because a medical leave of absence is not an accommodation that enables an individual to continue working, but rather something that excuses an employee's inability to work. See Severson v. Heartland Woodcraft, Inc., 872 F.3d 476, 481 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 1441, 200 L. Ed. 2d 717 (2018). Because Ostrowski became unable to work at all after July 11, 2018, when three days of walking to her office made her heart condition "too severe" to accommodate, (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 164:22-167:2, ECF No. 42-2), she was no longer a qualified individual after July 11, 2018. Ostrowski's failure to accommodate claim therefore cannot depend on any events occurring after July 11, 2018.
Ostrowski's own knowledge of her need for accommodations further narrows the relevant timeframe of the Court's analysis. Ostrowski did not know she was unable to walk the distance from the nearest parking lots to Lindley Hall until July 9, 2018, the day the Kinsey Institute began operating from Lindley Hall. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 114:12-17, ECF No. 42-2.) If Ostrowski herself was not aware that she needed [*14]  accommodations until July 9, 2018, IU certainly could not have been aware of her needs until that day as well.
In considering Ostrowski's failure to accommodate claim, the Court will therefore focus on the parties' conduct during the three days Ostrowski walked between Lindley Hall and the disabled parking spots in the Owen Hall parking lot: July 9 through July 11, 2018.

B. Employer's Awareness
The crux of this case is IU's awareness of Ostrowski's need for accommodations. "An employee has the initial duty to inform the employer of a disability before [Rehabilitation Act] liability may be triggered for failure to provide accommodations" because an "employer that has no knowledge of an employee's disability cannot be held liable for not accommodating the employee." Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1134 (7th Cir. 1996); see also Jovanovic v. In-Sink-Erator Div. of Emerson Elec. Co., 201 F.3d 894, 899 (7th Cir. 2000). But the employee need not utter any "magic words," Bond v. Sheahan, 152 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1072 (N.D. Ill. 2001), so long as the employee makes the employer aware that he "has a disability and desires an accommodation," Sears, 417 F.3d at 803.
Ostrowski claims she notified the University of her need for additional accommodations by speaking with multiple senior IU administrators. After work on July 9, she asked Director of Parking Operations Turnipseed for a disabled parking space closer to Lindley [*15]  Hall. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 115:25-116:24, 148:21-149:3, ECF No. 42-2; Turnipseed Dep. Tr. 16:15-17-1, ECF No. 42-27.) Also on July 9, she called the Office of the Vice President of Capital Planning and Facilities, asking for a parking spot next to Lindley Hall. (Morrison Dep. Tr. 19:12-20:25, ECF No. 42-26.) Vice President Morrison knew "in rough terms" about Ostrowski's request by July 9 and became "familiar with the details" by July 10. (Morrison Dep. Tr. 8:10-14, 20:10-25, 22:18-21, ECF No. 42-26; Morrison Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 42-12.) On July 10, the Supervisor of Auxiliary Business Services, (July 10, 2018 Email, ECF No. 42-28), the Provost's assistant, (id.), and the Vice Provost for Research, (July 10, 2018 Email, ECF No. 44-2 at 37-38), became aware of Ostrowski's need for accommodation after receiving an email from Turnipseed. And throughout the week of July 9, 2018, Carter, Ostrowski's direct supervisor, was aware of her disability and her struggle to obtain a new accommodation to make the walk from her car to the office. (See, e.g., Carter Decl. ¶¶ 15-21, ECF No. 42-9.)
However, Ostrowski never directly requested accommodations from Pavalko or anyone else working at the OVPFAA. [*16]  (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 134:2-6, 136:10-137:19, ECF No. 42-2.) IU believes this is the fatal flaw of Ostrowski's failure to accommodate claim. Indeed, some courts have treated an employee's failure to use established procedures for reporting disabilities and requesting accommodations as a failure to inform the employer. See Edwards v. EPA, 456 F. Supp. 2d 72, 103 (D.D.C. 2006) (employee's oral request to supervisor to work from home insufficient where employer had required such requests to be made more formally); Williamson v. Clarke Cnty. Dep't of Human Res., 834 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1321 (S.D. Ala. 2011) (employee who mentioned disability only in informal conversation and never connected his requests for accommodation with disability did not adequately inform employer); Erbel v. Johanns, No. 304-CV-555, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33900, 2007 WL 1387331, at *7 (E.D. Tenn. May 8, 2007) ("[W]hen an employer establishes a fixed set of procedures to request accommodations, the employee's failure to file a proper request dooms her claim for failure to accommodate."); Young v. Ariz. Summit Law Sch. LLC, No. CV-16-03490-PHX-DJH, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33468, 2020 WL 954990, at *8 (D. Ariz. Feb. 27, 2020) (student who failed to follow unaccredited law school's fixed policy for submitting disability accommodation requests did not adequately request accommodation); Gilmore v. Boeing Co., No. C16-1617-MJP, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24407, 2018 WL 883875, at *5 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 14, 2018) (employee's oral request for accommodations to supervisor not adequate to inform employer of disability where employer required such requests to go through separate department's formal process). But, in these cases, the more [*17]  formal procedures for requesting accommodations that the employees failed to abide by were exclusive procedures. Where an employer's procedure for requesting accommodations is suggested but not exclusive, an employee's failure to follow the procedure will not preclude relief under a failure to accommodate claim. For example, in Lee v. District of Columbia, 920 F. Supp. 2d 127 (D.D.C. 2013), a city employee failed to request an accommodation through the city's disability coordinator, instead speaking to his supervisors. The court there nevertheless found that the employee had presented enough evidence for a jury to find that the city was aware of his disability, as the record did not show that submitting a request to the disability coordinator was the exclusive and fixed procedure for seeking an accommodation. Id. at 137.
Likewise, the evidence here certainly shows that IU prefers academic appointees' accommodations requests to go through the OVPFAA; but the evidence does not unequivocally show that interfacing with the OVPFAA was the exclusive established process for academic appointees seeking a disability accommodation. When asked at her deposition "how many different ways someone like Nancy [Ostrowski] could make a reasonable accommodation request," [*18]  Pavalko's first response, after pausing to think about it, was that Ostrowski "could talk to her immediate supervisor." (Pavalko Dep. Tr. 22:18-23:5, ECF No. 44-11.) In fact, the Memorandum of Understanding granting Ostrowski a flexible-hours accommodation was reached between Ostrowski and Carter, without the involvement of the OVPFAA—Pavalko verified that it was "not improper" for them to establish an accommodation in that way. (Id. at 36:1-8.) Pavalko additionally testified that employees from HR like Epperson will bring her accommodation requests for academic appointees like Ostrowski, (id. at 25:9-18), and that employees like Ostrowski could go directly to the University subdivisions handling facilities or parking for certain types of accommodations, (id. at 29:1-15).
True, Pavalko also said that the OVPFAA was the best and most efficient point of contact for academic appointees seeking accommodations. (Id.; see also id. at 36:6-8 ("I think it would have been helpful if [the OVPFAA] had known about [the Memorandum of Understanding]." (emphasis added)).) And she expects IU's department heads to refer accommodation requests to the OVPFAA, as the OVPFAA trains them to do every year. [*19]  (Id. at 20:7-22:15.) But read in the light most favorable to Ostrowski, Pavalko's testimony shows that the OVPFAA was not the exclusive established procedure for requesting accommodations. And if the Director of the Office of Parking Operations, the Vice President of Capital Planning and Facilities, the Supervisor of Auxiliary Business Services, the Provost's assistant, the Vice Provost for Research, and the Director of the Kinsey Institute should have, but failed, to timely inform the right people of Ostrowski's need for accommodation—because of inadequate training or otherwise—a reasonable jury could infer that the University had constructive knowledge of Ostrowski's need.
To summarize, a jury could reasonably find that IU had notice of Ostrowski's walking problems via her dialogue with many senior IU administrators. And, although Ostrowski did not contact the OVPFAA, a jury could reasonably find that the OVPFAA was not the sole avenue for requesting an accommodation. A jury could therefore reasonably find that IU was aware of Ostrowski's disability and need.

C. Reasonable Accommodation
The remaining question is whether Ostrowski can show that IU failed to reasonably accommodate her. [*20]  Although the Court recognizes that accommodating Ostrowski before her heart condition rendered her permanently disabled would have required IU to act very rapidly over the course of just a few days, "[a]n unreasonable delay in providing an accommodation for an employee's known disability can amount to a failure to accommodate his disability that violates the Rehabilitation Act." McCray v. Wilkie, 966 F.3d 616, 621 (7th Cir. 2020) (citations omitted).
Relevant to the third prong of the failure to accommodate inquiry is something called the "interactive process." If an employee discloses a disability and a reasonable accommodation is possible, an employer has an obligation to engage with the employee in an interactive process to "determine the appropriate accommodation under the circumstances." Sears, 417 F.3d at 805 (citation omitted). "When a reasonable accommodation was possible and the employer did not offer it . . . responsibility will lie with the party that caused the breakdown" in the interactive process. Sansone, 917 F.3d at 980 (quoting Sears, 417 F.3d at 805) (cleaned up). The Court must "isolate the cause of the breakdown and then assign responsibility." Beck, 75 F.3d at 1135. As an example, an employer who "refused [a] request for a modest accommodation, then did nothing to engage with [the employee] in determining [*21]  alternative accommodations" clearly caused the breakdown in the interactive process. Gile v. United Airlines, Inc., 213 F.3d 365, 373 (7th Cir. 2000).
There are two issues to resolve on this third prong of Ostrowski's failure to accommodate claim: (1) whether granting Ostrowski a new disabled parking spot closer to Lindley Hall would have been a reasonable accommodation, and (2) whether IU otherwise reasonably accommodated Ostrowski. Because a jury could find that Ostrowski's requested accommodation was reasonable, and because a jury could find that IU rejected that option without providing an adequate alternative, summary judgment is not appropriate.
1. New Disabled Parking Space
The only accommodation Ostrowski identified and requested in the three relevant days was creating for her a new disabled parking space in the lane leading up to and past Lindley Hall. IU counters that this was not a viable option, as that drive was a fire lane reserved for service vehicles.
First, an evidentiary issue: Ostrowski has supplied three sets of photos purportedly showing the lane at issue. (See Ex. D, ECF Nos. 44-5, 44-6, 44-7.) IU objects to these photos on authentication grounds. To authenticate an item of evidence, the proponent of the item "must produce evidence [*22]  sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is." Fed. R. Evid. 901(a). This can be done in a number of ways, including by submitting the testimony of a witness with knowledge, Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(1), or by pointing to the "appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item," Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(4). Ostrowski has not supplied an affidavit from a witness with knowledge. Her only sworn testimony about any photos arose in her deposition, in which she said she had taken photos of the driving lane next to Lindley Hall on July 11, 2018. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 150:25-151:8, ECF No. 42-2.) It is unclear whether this deposition testimony refers to the photos before the Court or some other unspecified set of photos. Nor can the Court determine from the contents of the photos themselves that they show the lane next to Lindley Hall—the Court is not familiar with that road. This evidence is insufficient for the Court to determine that the photos offered by Ostrowski depict the driveway leading to and past Lindley Hall. Hence, the photos are unauthenticated and inadmissible.3
Fortunately for Ostrowski, she has adduced enough evidence—sans photos—that carving a new disabled parking [*23]  spot in the lane next to Lindley Hall would have been a reasonable accommodation. The University maintains that the lane at issue was and is a fire lane reserved for emergency vehicles and that any blockage of that lane by new parking spots would "create an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of anyone inside" Lindley Hall, the Chemistry Building, and two other nearby buildings bordering the road. (Morrison Decl. ¶ 3, ECF No. 42-12.) However, there are no fire lane markings or signs along the road to indicate that it is a fire lane. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 107:18-19, ECF No. 42-2.) A reasonable jury could doubt that the lane is so tantamount to people's health and safety when it is not even physically designated as a service-vehicle lane. Furthermore, "there were cars parked in many different spots closer to Lindley Hall than [Ostrowski] was able to park." (Id. at 151:6-8.) Carter testified that "every time" she had been to Lindley Hall before the Kinsey Institute relocated there, "cars and trucks parked all around and right next to the building." (Carter Decl. ¶ 14, ECF No. 42-9.) As of February 2020, vehicles continued to be parked along that driveway near Lindley Hall. (Id.) [*24]  One day, Carter counted seventeen vehicles "in this place that there was supposedly no parking." (Carter Dep. Tr. 37:3-12, ECF No. 42-4.) These were "all different kinds of vehicles," not just service vehicles. (Id.) Even if the cars were illegally parked, given the University's apparent acquiescence to their consistent presence in a service-vehicle lane, a jury could reasonably infer that there was enough space in the road to carve out a new disabled parking spot for Ostrowski without unreasonably obstructing service vehicles. It is undisputed that the University has previously carved out temporary disabled parking spots where no parking spots existed before. (Turnipseed Dep. Tr. 25:2-18, ECF No. 42-27.) Putting this all together, a jury could reasonably conclude that creating a new disabled parking spot—even a temporary one, while the University figured out some other accommodation for Ostrowski—in the lane near Lindley Hall was a feasible and reasonable accommodation, which IU rejected without adequate counteroffer.
2. Working from Home
Alternatively, IU contends that Ostrowski did not need any new accommodations because she had a reasonable accommodation all along: the flexibility [*25]  to work from home whenever her medical condition required it. IU asserts that it is Ostrowski's own fault that she chose not to exercise that accommodation during the three days in which walking exacerbated her heart condition. Of course, if Ostrowski already had a reasonable accommodation, even if it was not the accommodation she preferred, her failure to accommodate claim must fail. See, e.g., Gratzl v. Off. of Chief Judges of 12th, 18th, 19th, & 22nd Jud. Cirs., 601 F.3d 674, 681-82 (7th Cir. 2010).
"A 'reasonable accommodation' is one that allows the disabled employee to 'perform the essential functions of the employment position.'" Severson, 872 F.3d at 481 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). Though it is a close question, there is still a factual dispute as to whether the working-from-home arrangement the University had with Ostrowski would have reasonably accommodated her during the week of July 9, 2018. On the one hand, Ostrowski did have an arrangement with the University for "flexible" work hours. (Mem. Understanding, ECF No. 42-21 at 2.) Carter understood that accommodation to include the option to work from home whenever Ostrowski's health was poor. (Carter Dep. Tr. 69:24-25, ECF No. 42-4.) At least once, Ostrowski worked from home when she experienced an unspecified "medical crisis" for several days. (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 60:24-61:2, [*26]  ECF No. 42-2.) And Carter says she "of course" would have allowed Ostrowski to work from home at any point so long as her heart condition made going to work in person prohibitive. (Carter Dep. Tr. 21:9-14, 44:21, ECF No. 42-4.)
On the other hand, the text of the Memorandum of Understanding detailing the flexible-work arrangement says nothing about Ostrowski's ability to work from home, even if that is how Carter understood the accommodation. (Mem. Understanding, ECF No. 42-21 at 2.) It is unclear whether Ostrowski interpreted the document as permitting her to work from home—asked whether she ever used her flexible work schedule to work from home, she answered, "I don't remember." (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 76:25-77:2, ECF No. 42-2.) And, although Ostrowski had previously worked from home when she was ill or had a "medical crisis," she believes that she achieved that through "primarily sick leave" rather than the flexible-work-schedule arrangement. (Id. at 62:12-13.)
Additionally, there are facts casting doubt on whether working-from-home was the obvious option IU says it was. Carter testified that she expected Ostrowski to attend work in person that week because it was "especially important [*27]  at that time to help . . . [Kinsey] staff" move into the Institute's new facility at Lindley Hall. (Id. at 35:17-36:16.) For her part, Ostrowski says she was required in the office that week: "As associate director, you need to be on-site." (Ostrowski Dep. Tr. 60:16-19, ECF No. 42-2; see also id. at 110:23 ("I was told I needed to be on-site. I did my duty. I walked up to the building.")).
Moreover, there are facts to suggest that working from home did not allow Ostrowski to fulfill some of her duties as associate director—attending meetings and interacting with faculty and staff.4 (Id. at 59:4-9.) Even if working from home would have averted Ostrowski's health crisis, it is therefore unclear whether working from home would have empowered her to fulfill the "essential functions of the employment position." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
Though, on balance, the evidence seems to suggest that Ostrowski could have worked from home those three days instead of undertaking the walks that precipitated the deterioration of her health, the Court must avoid the "trap of weighing conflicting evidence during a summary judgment proceeding." Payne v. Pauley, 337 F.3d 767, 771 (7th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). Viewed in the light most favorable to Ostrowski, these facts [*28]  present a genuine dispute over whether Ostrowski could have simply worked from home the week of July 9, 2018.
Assuming Ostrowski could convince a jury of notice to IU, she has therefore adduced enough evidence that the University failed to offer her a reasonable accommodation to survive summary judgment. A jury could reasonably find that creating a disabled parking spot in the lane near Lindley Hall was a reasonable accommodation that IU rejected. A jury could also reasonably find that Ostrowski was not otherwise reasonably accommodated the week of July 9, 2018. Summary judgment is therefore inappropriate.

IV. Conclusion
Ostrowski has adduced evidence to establish every element of her failure to accommodate claim under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act at this stage. But because there are remaining genuine issues of material fact, the case must proceed to trial. Accordingly, the cross-motions for summary judgment, (ECF Nos. 42, 44), are denied.
SO ORDERED.
