ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (Doc. 29)
Before the Court is a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Weingarten Realty Investors. (Mot., Doc. 29.) Plaintiff opposed and Defendant replied. (Opp., Doc. 34; Reply, Doc. 37.) Having considered the parties' briefs and held oral argument, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for the reasons stated below.

I. BACKGROUND1
This action arises out of Plaintiff Cristina Marinescu's ("Plaintiff's") employment as an administrative assistant in the property management department of Defendant Weingarten Realty Investors' ("Weingarten's") Costa Mesa office. (Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes ("Reply to SGD"), Doc. 42 ¶ 1.) Plaintiff was hired on a temporary basis in April 2019 and started a full-time position as an administrative assistant on June [*2]  1, 2019. (Id.) Plaintiff spent fifty percent of her time managing the front desk, greeting visitors, answering calls, and maintaining copiers and printers. (Id. ¶ 39.) She spent twenty percent of her time processing incoming and outgoing mail. (Id. ¶ 40.) All the foregoing duties had to be performed in the office. (Id. ¶¶ 39-40.) Plaintiff's additional job duties required the use of computer software and Weingarten's internal computer system that were available to Plaintiff only on her work computer. (Id. ¶ 41.) Plaintiff also had to maintain physical files and inventory in the office. (Id. ¶ 42.)
Plaintiff acknowledged receipt of Weingarten's policy on time off and leaves of absence (Reply to SGD ¶ 48), which provides as follows:
The affected associate is responsible for informing his/her supervisor or Human Resources of his/her anticipated date of return and provide his/her supervisor with any restrictions on their return to work. The associate is required to contact his/her supervisor with updates on his/her status and anticipated length of leave as required by law and Human Resources. It is also the associate's responsibility to provide any requested/required physician's medical [*3]  statement or documentation reflecting their status and limitations to the work activity. Such documentation may be required for approval of, or continuation of, a STD leave of absence. The associate will not be permitted to return to work if he/she fails to provide the Company with any legally authorized documentation or information required by the Company.
(Reply to SGD ¶ 49.)
Moreover, according to the policy, associates who fail to return to work following the expiration of an approved absence may be considered as having voluntarily resigned their employment with Weingarten. (Reply to SGD ¶ 52.)
On July 8, 2019—about five weeks after starting work—Plaintiff was injured at work lifting water bottles. (Id. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff continued to report to work from July 8 to July 11, 2019. (Id. ¶ 4.) On July 12, 2019, Plaintiff texted her supervisor, Christine Thomas ("Thomas") that she was unable to come in that day due to shoulder pain, and that she was going to urgent care to get muscle relaxers. (Id. ¶ 5.) Thomas responded to the text, stating "hope you feel well" and asking that Plaintiff provide her with a status update that Monday. (Id. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff returned to work on July 15 and worked [*4]  the next day, July 16, 2019. (Id. ¶ 7.) The next day, July 17, 2019, Plaintiff again texted Thomas stating that she could not come into work, and instead, she went to an emergency room. (Id. ¶ 8.)
Plaintiff never reported to work again. (Reply to SGD ¶ 9.) Between July 17, 2019 and October 10, 2019—when Weingarten terminated Plaintiff's employment—Plaintiff provided a series of doctor's notes excusing her from work and Weingarten in turn requested that Plaintiff provide additional information to substantiate a request for a medical leave, or to provide a general release signed by a doctor, clearing her to return to work. At no point between Plaintiff's first absence and her termination did Plaintiff, or any of her physicians, provide Weingarten with any of the specific information it requested. The full timeline of the parties' communications about Plaintiff's medical leave and subsequent termination are summarized below.
• On July 18, 2019, Plaintiff emailed Weingarten a "Work Release Form" from the emergency room doctor, stating that Plaintiff was seen in the facility on July 17, 2019 and that she could return to work on July 20, 2019. (Reply to SGD ¶ 10.) The Work Release Form did [*5]  not note whether Plaintiff had any physical restrictions. (Id. ¶ 11.)
• On July 22, 2019, Plaintiff emailed a "Return to Work/School" note from Enliven Medical Clinic, which stated that Plaintiff was seen at the clinic on July 18, 2019, and that she could not return to work until July 28, 2019. (RSGD ¶ 12.) This note itself did not provide information on Plaintiff's work restrictions, but stated that any restrictions were pending MRI results. (Id. ¶ 13.)
• On July 23, 2019, Weingarten's Human Resources Director, Kristy Trieu ("Trieu"), emailed Plaintiff, informing her that the Work Release Form she had sent on July 18 was insufficient to substantiate her requested medical leave because it did not provide information about the duration of Plaintiff's impairment, the activities that were limited by her impairment, the extent to which the impairment limited her ability to perform those activities, or why the additional requested time off was necessary. (RSGD ¶ 14.) In the same email, Trieu attached a cover letter for Plaintiff to provide to her medical provider that outlined the requested information. (Id. ¶ 15.)
• On July 24, 2019, Plaintiff emailed Trieu a note from the Enliven Medical [*6]  Clinic, which stated that Plaintiff had sustained an injury which impeded her ability to perform her regular work duties. (Id. ¶ 16.) The note further stated: "These injuries make it difficult for the patient to sit or stand for longer than two hours. These injuries appear to be of moderate severity and impede the patient's ability to work due to pain." (Id. ¶ 16.) The note also stated that Plaintiff had an appointment scheduled with an orthopedic surgeon on August 13, 2019, and that she could return to work on August 14, 2019, unless the orthopedic surgeon said otherwise. (Id. ¶ 17.)
• On August 1, 2019, Plaintiff provided Trieu a "Disability Status Note" from Dr. Wesley Nottage, Plaintiff's workers' compensation doctor, which was dated July 31, 2019 and stated that Plaintiff could return to work on September 20, 2019, but did not identify any work restrictions. (Id. ¶ 18.) Trieu emailed Plaintiff back, explaining that the Disability Status Note was insufficient because it did not provide any information on the relationship between Plaintiff's medical condition and her job duties. (Id. ¶ 19.) In that same email, Trieu attached a letter and a form for Plaintiff to provide to Dr. Nottage, [*7]  and requested that Plaintiff have Dr. Nottage complete the form in its entirety and return it to Weingarten. (Id. ¶ 20.)
• On August 16, 2019, Trieu emailed Plaintiff requesting that Plaintiff provide the requested information from Dr. Nottage by August 30, 2019. (Id. ¶ 21.) In response, Plaintiff informed Trieu that she hired an attorney and requested that Weingarten direct its questions to her attorney. (Id. ¶ 22.)
• On August 26, 2019, Trieu informed Plaintiff that Weingarten's attorney had attempted to reach her attorney multiple times, but never received a response. Trieu again stated that she expected to receive the requested information from Dr. Nottage no later than August 30, 2019. (Id. ¶ 23.)
• On September 17, 2019, Trieu sent another email, requesting that Plaintiff confirm her return-to-work date of September 20, per the Disability Status Note, and informing Plaintiff that company policy required her to submit a release from her physician in order to return to work. (Id. ¶ 24.) Plaintiff provided Trieu a doctor's note from Dr. Nottage, dated September 17, 2019, which stated that she could return to work on September 26, 2019. (Id. ¶ 25.)
• On September 18, 2019, Plaintiff [*8]  informed Trieu that she had been referred to Dr. Mousavi through her workers' compensation case and that she had an appointment scheduled for September 25, 2019. (Id. ¶ 26.) The parties dispute whether Plaintiff "promise[d] she would get the information that Weingarten had been requesting" at that appointment. (Id.; see also Marinescu Decl., Doc. 34-2, ¶13.)
• On September 26, 2019, Trieu emailed Plaintiff, noting that the last document Plaintiff had provided indicated she could return to work that day, September 26, but that Weingarten had not heard from Plaintiff about her return. Trieu stated that she knew Plaintiff had an appointment with Dr. Mousavi on September 25, 2019 and that she was expecting that Dr. Mousavi would complete the form that Trieu had emailed to Plaintiff and return it to Weingarten by September 30, 2019. (Id. ¶ 27.) Plaintiff responded to Weingarten's request with a note by Dr. Mousavi, which was dated September 25, 2019. (Id. ¶ 28.) Dr. Mousavi's note stated that Plaintiff was under his medical care and being treated for a chronic pain condition. (Exhibit 20 to Amended Statement of Undisputed Facts ("SUF"), Doc. 31-21.) Dr. Mousavi noted that he was referring [*9]  Plaintiff to physical therapy and that Plaintiff was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with him, but he did not excuse Plaintiff from work on any specific date.
• Plaintiff did not provide any note from a medical provider excusing her work absences from September 26 to October 4, 2019. (Reply to SGD ¶ 30.) Neither Plaintiff nor any of her physicians sent Weingarten the completed form that Trieu had provided by the September 30, 2019 deadline. (Reply to SGD ¶ 29.)
• On September 27, 2019, Trieu emailed Plaintiff again, stating that Weingarten did not have a note authorizing her continued absence from work and asked that, by October 9, 2019, Plaintiff provide Weingarten with either (1) a note from a medical doctor authorizing her continued absence, along with the completed Physician Statement form that was provided to Plaintiff; or (2) a full release to return to work. (Reply to SGD ¶ 31.) Trieu also stated that if Plaintiff was aware of any reason why she would not be able to provide the information by October 9, 2019, to let Trieu know immediately. (Id.) In response, Plaintiff emailed Trieu, stating: "I have taken each every physician statement [sic] you provided for me to take to [*10]  doctors and they have decline [sic] to fill out. Dr. Nottage's office said that the employer needs to go to the adjuster for this information. Dr. Mousavi's office said that this information needs to be filled out by physical therapy office [sic]." (Id.)
• On October 1, 2019, Trieu responded to Plaintiff's email, stating that the doctors' notes Plaintiff had sent in did not indicate she needed to be absent from work past September 26. Trieu also wrote: "I will work with the Workers Compensation adjuster to hopefully gain some additional information from him; however, it is your responsibility to provide us with one of the two items listed [in the September 27 email]." (Exhibit 12 to Marinescu Decl., Doc. 34-2, at ECF 56.) Trieu again requested that Plaintiff let her know if she could not meet the October 9 deadline so that they could work out a mutually agreeable deadline.
• On October 4, 2019, Plaintiff sent Trieu an email attaching a note from the Emergency Department at Saddleback Medical Center, which stated that Plaintiff was excused from work from October 3 to 6, 2019. (Reply to SGD ¶ 33.)
• On October 7, 2019, Trieu emailed Plaintiff, reminding her that the note from the Emergency [*11]  Department at Saddleback Medical Center stated that she would be able to return on that day (October 7, 2019). Trieu further stated that Weingarten had not received the requested information in support of her continued leave of absence, and requested that Plaintiff provide either the completed form or a release to return to work by October 9th. (Id. ¶ 34.) That same day, Plaintiff emailed Trieu a medical note by Dr. Marc. R. Cohen (ER physician). The note stated Plaintiff was seen on October 5, 2019 and could return to work on October 12, 2019. (Id. ¶ 35.)
• On October 9, 2019, Plaintiff emailed Trieu and stated that she made an appointment with her primary care doctor for October 14th to get a release to return to work even though she was still in pain. (Id. ¶ 36.)
• Plaintiff did not provide a release to return to work or have a medical provider complete the form provided by Weingarten by the deadline of October 9, 2019. (Id. ¶ 37.)
On November 6, 2019, Plaintiff filed this action in Orange County Superior Court, alleging (1) disability discrimination, (2) failure to provide reasonable accommodation, (3) failure to engage in the interactive process, (4) retaliation under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), and (5) wrongful [*12]  termination in violation of public policy. (Compl., Doc. 9.) On December 9, 2019, Weingarten removed the action to this Court, invoking diversity jurisdiction. (Notice of Removal ("NOR"), Doc. 1.) Weingarten now moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims, or summary adjudication as to each claim, in the alternative.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all justifiable inferences in that party's favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Summary judgment is proper "if the [moving party] shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the [moving party] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A factual dispute is "genuine" when there is sufficient evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could resolve the issue in the non-movant's favor, and a fact is "material" when it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. But "credibility determinations, the weighing of evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge." Acosta v. City of Costa Mesa, 718 F.3d 800, 828 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)).
The role of the Court is [*13]  not to resolve disputes of fact but to assess whether there are any factual disputes to be tried. The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute of fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "Once the moving party carries its initial burden, the adverse party 'may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading,' but must provide affidavits or other sources of evidence that 'set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).

III. DISCUSSION
Weingarten has moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims, or, in the alternative, summary adjudication on each cause of action. The Court first addresses Plaintiff's FEHA claim for disability discrimination, which is governed by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) framework. The Court then turns to Plaintiff's claims for retaliation, failure to accommodate, failure to engage in the interactive process, and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.2
A. Disability Discrimination Claim
"Because state and federal employment discrimination laws are similar, California courts look to federal precedent when interpreting FEHA." Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc., 658 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir.2011) (internal citation omitted). "In particular, California courts [*14]  use the familiar McDonnell Douglas [Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)] burden-shifting test when analyzing disparate treatment claims under FEHA." Id. Under that framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by offering evidence that gives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir. 1998), as amended (Aug. 11, 1998) (internal citations omitted). Then, the burden shifts to the defendant to set forth a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the actions taken. If the defendant does so, the plaintiff must then show that the defendant's proffered reason is a pretext for retaliation. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-04. The burden of production then shifts to defendant under the McDonnell Douglas framework.
"A defendant's summary judgment motion 'slightly modifies the order of these [McDonnell Douglas] showings.'" Wills v. Superior Ct., 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 160, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, as modified on denial of reh'g (May 12, 2011) (applying the McDonnell Douglas framework to a discrimination claim under state law). Accordingly, Defendant's burden on its summary judgment motion is to either (1) negate an essential element of Plaintiff's prima facie case or (2) establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff. Id. The burden then shifts to Plaintiff to offer "specific, substantial [*15]  evidence of pretext." Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 890 (9th Cir. 1994), as amended on denial of reh'g (July 14, 1994).
1. Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination.
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and, (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability." Faust v. California Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 886, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007). In this context, "qualified to do his job" means that the plaintiff can perform the essential functions of the position with or without accommodations. See Wheeler v. SPS Technologies, LLC, No. SACV 17-cv-01788-JLS-KES, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 224181, 2018 WL 7501581 at *5 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 24, 2018).
A finite leave of absence that enables the employee to return to his or her post can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA. See Department of Fair Employment and Housing v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 744 (9th Cir. 2011). "However, an employer is not required to provide an indefinite leave of absence." Tipton v. Airport Terminal Servs., Inc., No. CV18-09503 ABJ (EMX), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131828, 2020 WL 3980127, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2020). And where, as here, performance requires attendance at the job, an indefinite leave of absence is not a reasonable accommodation. See id.; see also Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1237 (9th Cir. 2012).
Weingarten argues that Plaintiff cannot establish her prima facie case because she cannot prove she was qualified to perform the essential functions of the position and her successive requests for a leave of absence amounted to a request for "indefinite" leave, which was unreasonable. [*16]  In support, Weingarten relies on Shamir v. SCCA Store Holdings, Inc., No. CV 13-6672 ABC (ASX), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 206317, 2014 WL 12597151 (C.D. Cal. June 9, 2014). In Shamir, the plaintiff, a beauty specialist at a Saks Fifth Avenue cosmetics counter, went out on leave due to pain she was experiencing in her feet and legs. Shamir, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 206317, 2014 WL 12597151, at *2. Plaintiff provided doctor's notes that projected various return-to-work dates, but each such note was succeeded by a new note extending leave from work. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 206317, [WL] at *2-3. When she eventually was terminated, she sued her employer, claiming that her termination was disability discrimination. In granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment, the court in Shamir determined the plaintiff was not a qualified individual because she was unable to be physically present at work at the time of her termination, and the series of doctor's notes extending her leave rendered her leave of absence "indefinite," which was not a reasonable accommodation. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 206317, [WL] at *4-6; see also Tipton v. Airport Terminal Services, Inc., No. CV-18:09503-ABJ (EMx), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131828, 2020 WL 3980127, at *7-8 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2020) (employer was not obligated to extend a period of leave indefinitely even when the employee was off work for only one month prior to termination).
As an initial matter, it is undisputed that Plaintiff's presence in the office was an essential job function. Specifically, Weingarten has proffered Plaintiff's testimony that she spent fifty percent of her time [*17]  managing the front desk, greeting visitors, answering calls, and maintaining copiers and printers, (Reply to SGD ¶ 39), and that she spent twenty percent of her time on processing incoming and outgoing mail (Id. ¶ 40). And Plaintiff does not dispute that most of her duties required her physical presence in the office. (Id. ¶¶ 39-40.) Accordingly, to prove that she was "qualified to do [her] job," Plaintiff must prove, at trial, that she could perform her in-office tasks with or without accommodations. See Wheeler v. SPS Technologies, LLC, No. SACV 17-cv-01788-JLS-KES, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 224181, 2018 WL 7501581 at *5 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 24, 2018).
Here, the undisputed record also shows that Plaintiff cannot prove she was able to perform in-office tasks with or without an accommodation. Plaintiff stopped reporting to work on July 17, 2019 and never returned to work after that. (Reply to SGD ¶¶ 7-8.) Between July 17 and her termination on October 10, Plaintiff never provided Weingarten with the requested medical information, including the nature and severity of her disability, and any necessary accommodations or restrictions. (Id. ¶¶ 29-37; "Weingarten Request," Ex. 7 to Marinescu Decl., Doc. 34-2, at ECF 39-41.) In her brief, and at the hearing, Plaintiff argued that Weingarten was obligated to give her another extension until [*18]  October 14, 2019, as requested in her October 9 email. (Opp. at 21.) But, again, neither the October 9 email, nor any of Plaintiff's other communications to Weingarten, reflected that Plaintiff's absence was a reasonable accommodation that would enable her to perform her essential job functions. And the record before the Court also indicates that Plaintiff never proposed any other reasonable accommodation (e.g., limited hours, no lifting) that would enable her to perform her work. Nor did Plaintiff provide Weingarten with requested information so that Weingarten could assess what, if any, reasonable accommodations were possible.
Nor did Plaintiff submit any evidence reflecting that, but for her termination, she could have returned to work within a reasonable time. Rather, Weingarten submits that, on January 8, 2020, three months after Plaintiff was terminated, the State of California's Employment Development Department issued a letter of determination finding that she was not eligible to receive unemployment benefits because she was unable to work for health reasons. (Supplemental Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("Supp. SUF"), Doc. 40 ¶ 1.) This determination is further evidence that [*19]  Plaintiff would not have been available for work even if Weingarten had granted her the additional leave until October 14, 2019.
In sum, because it is Plaintiff's burden to prove that the requested accommodation would enable her "to perform the essential functions of the job" and Plaintiff has proffered no evidence in support of that element, Weingarten is entitled to summary judgment on this claim. Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 978, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008).

2. Weingarten has a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions.
Even if Plaintiff had established a prima facie case of discrimination, the application of Weingarten's medical leave policy is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for Weingarten's action under McDonnell Douglas's second step. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-04. This Court has previously held that evenhanded application of internal medical leave policies such as Weingarten's provides a non-discriminatory purpose for adverse employment actions. See Hooker v. Parker-Hannifin Corp., No. SACV 11-483-JST EX, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49144, 2012 WL 1156437 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 3, 2012) (granting summary judgment in defendant's favor on discrimination and retaliation claims under FEHA), aff'd, 585 F. App'x 386 (9th Cir. 2014). In Hooker, this Court relied in part on Buckman v. MCI World Com, Inc., No. 08-16537, 374 Fed. Appx. 719, 720 (9th Cir. Mar. 23, 2010) where the plaintiff asserted that his employer terminated him in violation of the federal Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Id. at *3. Plaintiff's medical leave ended on a [*20]  Friday, and on Monday, plaintiff called in forty-eight minutes after his shift was to begin to notify his employer that he would be absent. Id. (citing Buckman, 374 Fed. Appx. at 720). The employer terminated plaintiff for failure to observe its policy, which required employees to call in the night before their shift if they were going to be tardy or absent. Id. The Ninth Circuit concluded that because the FMLA requires "an employee to comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances." Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(d)); see also Coleman v. Dept. of Personnel Admin., 52 Cal.3d 1102, 1111, 278 Cal. Rptr. 346, 805 P.2d 300 (1991) (a state employee surrenders his property interest in employment after being AWOL for five consecutive days).
According to Weingarten's policy, associates who fail to return to work following the expiration of an approved absence may be considered as having voluntarily resigned their employment with Weingarten. (Reply to SGD ¶ 52.) Although Weingarten informed Plaintiff repeatedly that she had failed to substantiate her need for medical leave, it gave Plaintiff multiple opportunities to provide supplemental information. Plaintiff not only failed to provide the specific information Weingarten requested, but also failed to provide [*21]  any documentation even purporting to excuse her absence between September 26 and October 4, 2019. Weingarten's policies require employees who take medical leave to: provide their anticipated date of return; to update their supervisor at least every two weeks about their situation; submit any requested/required physician's medical statement or documentation reflecting their status and limitations to the work activity; and provide a release clearing them to return to work if their absence is the result of a disability. (See Reply to SGD ¶¶ 49-52.) It is undisputed that Plaintiff repeatedly failed to provide requested information supporting her medical leave or to provide a release clearing her to return to work. Accordingly, Weingarten's application of its leave policies provides a non-discriminatory reason for the termination.

3. Plaintiff cannot show Weingarten's actions were pretext.
Once Weingarten has established a non-discriminatory purpose for terminating Plaintiff's employment, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to show that the proffered reason is mere pretext for discrimination. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804. "[A]t the summary judgment stage, a plaintiff may raise a genuine issue of material fact as [*22]  to pretext via (1) direct evidence of the employer's discriminatory motive or (2) indirect evidence that undermines the credibility of the employer's articulated reasons." Noyes v. Kelly Servs., 488 F.3d 1163, 1170-71 (9th Cir. 2007).
Plaintiff avers that Weingarten's reasons for terminating her are contradictory, and therefore pretextual. (Opp. at 19-20.) Specifically, Plaintiff points out that Weingarten's official notice stated Plaintiff was terminated "due to failure to return from leave of absence," (Ex. 14 to Marinescu Decl., Doc. 34-2 at ECF 61), but Trieu testified that Plaintiff was terminated because Plaintiff did not provide required medical information by October 9, 2019 (Trieu Depo, Ex. 23 to Sandberg Decl., Doc. 31-24 at 103:3-104:4). This is not the type of "contradiction" that gives rise to an inference of pretext; indeed, the two reasons are inextricably linked. Although the termination notice specifically cites Plaintiff's "failure to return from her leave of absence" as the reason for the termination, it sets out, in some detail, Plaintiff's requests for leave and Weingarten's repeated requests for additional information. The notice therefore indicates that Plaintiff was terminated because she failed to return to work without [*23]  providing the requisite information. This is consistent with Trieu's deposition testimony as well as Trieu's emails to Plaintiff during the interactive process, which clearly state that Plaintiff had to comply with one of two options by October 19, 2019: (1) provide the information Weingarten had requested to support her continued leave of absence, or (2) provide a release and return to work. (Reply to SGD ¶ 31.) Plaintiff was terminated because she provided neither.
In sum, the undisputed record shows that Weingarten was consistent in its reasons for terminating Plaintiff, and Plaintiff has not set forth any other evidence or argument that would lead to an inference that Weingarten's application of its leave policies is a pretext for discriminatory motive. See Schuler v. Chronicle Broad. Co. Inc., 793 F.2d 1010, 1011 (9th Cir. 1986) (citation omitted) (to meet her burden under the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff must offer specific and significantly probative evidence that the employer's alleged purpose is a pretext for discrimination). Plaintiff's discrimination claim therefore fails.

B. Retaliation Claim
The parties' briefs do not address, in any depth, the merits of Plaintiff's prima facie case for retaliation in violation of FEHA. However, the [*24]  retaliation claim is similarly governed by the McDonnell Douglas framework set forth above. See generally Hooker v. Parker-Hannifin Corp., No. SACV 11-483-JST EX, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49144, 2012 WL 1156437 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 3, 2012). Thus, even assuming Plaintiff can establish the elements of her retaliation claim, Weingarten is still entitled to summary judgment on this claim because the application of its leave policies provides a non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff, and Plaintiff has failed to show that Weingarten's application of the policy is mere pretext for retaliation. Thus, for the reasons set forth in Section III. A. 2-3, supra, Plaintiff's retaliation claim fails.

C. Reasonable Accommodation
"The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "[T]he plaintiff bears the burden of proving he or she was able to perform the essential functions of the job with accommodation." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 978, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008).
As set forth in Section III. A, supra, Plaintiff cannot establish that she was qualified to perform the essential functions of the position with or without an accommodation.
Again, Plaintiff points [*25]  only to the October 9 email, which informed Weingarten that Plaintiff had made a doctor's appointment to get a release and return to work even though she was still in pain. But, again, there is no evidence in the record indicating that Plaintiff could have returned to work had she been granted this additional time. Nor is there any evidence, or contention by Plaintiff, that she could have reported to the office and performed her essential job functions if Weingarten had provided her with other reasonable accommodations. Indeed, Plaintiff never asked Weingarten for a reasonable accommodation that would allow her to perform her work.
Because it is Plaintiff's burden to prove that the requested accommodation would enable her "to perform the essential functions of the job" and Plaintiff has proffered no evidence in support of that element, Weingarten is entitled to summary judgment on this claim. Nadaf-Rahrov,166 Cal. App. at 978.

D. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
"The interactive process required by the FEHA is an informal process with the employee or the employee's representative, to attempt to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (internal citation [*26]  and quotation marks omitted). The interactive process imposes burdens on both the employer and employee. Id. The employee must initiate the process unless the disability and resulting limitations are obvious. Once the interactive process is initiated, the employer's obligation to engage in the process in good faith is continuous. Id. Moreover, although an employee is not necessarily expected to identify and request all possible accommodations during the interactive process itself, once the parties are in litigation, "to prevail on a claim under [FEHA] for failure to engage in the interactive process, an employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Id. at 1018.
Here, it is undisputed that Weingarten provided Plaintiff with a form to give to her physician, which detailed all the information Weingarten was requesting, including which activities were limited by Plaintiff's disability and what accommodations could be provided. (See Weingarten Request.) Plaintiff does not dispute that she failed to provide the requested information by any of the three deadlines—August 30, September 30, and October 9—that Weingarten [*27]  provided. In advance of the final deadline, Trieu followed up with Plaintiff twice, asking her to write back if she believed she would not be able to meet the final October 9 deadline. Plaintiff's response to the first inquiry, dated September 27, 2019, indicated that the physicians Plaintiff had visited refused to fill out the form that Trieu had provided and had referred her instead to a physical therapist. But Plaintiff did not indicate she would be unable to gather the required information by October 9. Plaintiff never responded to Trieu's second email requesting that Plaintiff let her know if the October 9 deadline posed a problem. Nevertheless, Plaintiff did not send the requested information on October 9 and instead emailed Trieu, stating that she would try to get the release she needed to return to work at an October 14 appointment. In sum, the evidence before the Court does not suggest Weingarten failed to engage in the interactive process.
Indeed, Plaintiff's only argument in opposition to summary judgment on this claim is that Weingarten was required by FEHA regulations to grant Plaintiff the opportunity to provide information from her scheduled October 14 doctor's appointment. [*28]  (Opp. at 22-23.) Specifically, Plaintiff cites to 2 CCR § 11069(d)(4), which provides: "If information provided by the applicant or employee needs clarification, then the employer or other covered entity shall identify the issues that need clarification, specify what further information is needed, and allow the applicant or employee a reasonable time to produce the supplemental information." But the undisputed record shows that Weingarten identified issues with Plaintiff's documentation as early as July 23, 2019, and gave her three separate deadlines by which to provide the requested information before terminating her on October 11, 2019. Plaintiff does not argue that the time she was afforded to provide the supplemental information was unreasonable. Nor does she dispute that she failed to provide the requested information.
Even assuming Plaintiff can establish Weingarten failed to engage in the interactive process, the claim fails unless Plaintiff can also establish an objectively reasonable accommodation that would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job. Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018. Again, the only reasonable accommodation Plaintiff has identified is an additional absence as requested by her October 9 [*29]  email. However, as discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to proffer any evidence or argument in support of the proposition that the requested leave would have enabled to return to work. Nor has Plaintiff identified any other reasonable accommodation Weingarten could have made. As a California Court of Appeal put it in Scotch, a decision affirming a grant of summary judgment in the employer's favor: "[I]f this case were presented to a jury, what remedy could it provide? How was [plaintiff] damaged by any failure by [defendant] to engage in the interactive process in good faith? Unless, after litigation with full discovery, [plaintiff] identifies a reasonable accommodation that was objectively available during the interactive process, [she] has suffered no remedial injury from any violation of [FEHA]." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1019.
In sum, Weingarten is entitled to summary judgment on this claim because Plaintiff cannot meet her burden of proving she suffered a remedial injury.

E. Termination in Violation of Public Policy
Plaintiff's wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim is derivative of her FEHA claims. See Stevenson v. Superior Court, 16 Cal.4th 880, 897, 924, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157 (1997). Because Weingarten is entitled to summary judgment on the FEHA claims, Plaintiff's public [*30]  policy claim also fails.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendant is ORDERED to submit to the Court, no later than five (5) days from the date of this Order, a proposed judgment pursuant to the Court's Procedures.
DATED: June 29, 2021
