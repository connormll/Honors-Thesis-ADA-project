REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. INTRODUCTION
Pending before the court are cross motions for summary judgment filed by each of the parties in this case. (Docs. 23, 26). The plaintiff, Kelly Soutner, filed this action against her former employer, The Milton Hershey Medical Center ("Hershey Medical"), alleging that she was discriminated against and discharged because of her disabilities and for using protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2611, et seq. Soutner contends that she was discriminated against and denied FMLA leave, which resulted in unexcused absences from work, and that the defendant used these unexcused absences as the basis for her termination.
Soutner has filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on [*2]  her claim of FMLA retaliation. Hershey Medical has in turn filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all of the plaintiff's claims. The motions are fully briefed and are, therefore, ripe for resolution. For the reasons that follow, we will recommend that the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment be denied, and that the defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted.

II. BACKGROUND
Kelly Soutner began her employment with Hershey Medical in February 2011 as an Administrative Assistant. (Doc. 18, ¶ 12). Soutner suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Vertigo, and in 2013 and 2014, Hershey Medical approved her request for intermittent leave under the FMLA for these medical issues. (Id., ¶¶ 18 19). Hershey Medical uses a third-party administrator, FMLASource, through which employees request FMLA leave. (Doc. 24-2, at 3). FMLASource approves an employee's leave for general time periods but does not list the underlying condition for which the employee is requesting leave. (Doc. 28, at 5).
In accordance with Hershey Medical's FMLA policy, when an employee uses approved FMLA leave, he or she must report the leave to both [*3]  FMLASource and the individual department's call-off line. (Id.) When reporting an absence through the call-off line, an employee is required to indicate that she will be absent and indicate what type of leave she is using, i.e. paid time off, FMLA, or sick leave. (Id.; Doc. 28-1, at 65-66). Per the policy, if an employee does not follow the department procedure and designate the leave as FMLA-qualifying leave, or simply calls off "sick" with no explanation, "the time off may not be designated as FMLA and/or may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination." (Doc. 28-8, at 7). Further, although the policy allows for Hershey Medical to retroactively designate an absence as FMLA-protected leave, the policy also provides that Hershey Medical is not obligated to retroactively designate FMLA leave when an employee fails to follow the department's notice procedures. (Id., at 9-10).
It is absolutely undisputed that Soutner was fully aware of this policy. Indeed, Soutner had recorded the phone message that Hershey used to notify employees of the policy, which stated in clear and precise terms: "Hi, you have reached the call- off line for the care coordination department at the MS Hershey [*4]  Medical Center. Please leave a message including what time off you would like to use, for example, family sick time, FMLA, PTO, et cetera. Thank you." (Doc. 28-1, at 65-66). It is also undisputed that, despite her knowledge of this settled company policy, Soutner repeatedly failed to comply with the policy by designating her FMLA leave. Further, there is not dispute that persisted in failing to abide by Hershey's policies even after she was counselled on numerous occasions regarding her need to follow hospital rules and was warned that her on-going failure to obey those rules could lead to her termination.
On this score, Soutner was approved for intermittent FMLA leave from September 30, 2014 to October 16, 2014; from October 20, 2014 to January 4, 2015; from January 5, 2015 to September 23, 2015; and from November 10, 2015 through September 23, 2016. (Doc. 24-2, at 4-5). During these periods of approved leave, Soutner's estimated frequency of absence covered four treatments or appointments per month, lasting about two hours long, and three, two-day episodic incapacitations per month. (Id.) Soutner had also applied and was approved for continuous FMLA leave from February 8, 2016 to [*5]  February 10, 2016 (Id., at 5-6).
In March 2014, Soutner met with her supervisor, Amy Cutman, after she had accrued six unscheduled absences from July 2013 to February 2014. (Doc. 28, at 6). Cutman discussed the possibility of Soutner applying for FMLA leave if it was appropriate. (Id.) Cutman again met with Soutner in November 2014 and issued her a verbal warning, as Soutner had accrued eight unscheduled absences in the rolling year. (Id.) Per Hershey Medical's attendance policy, an employee will be terminated if she accrues nine unexcused absences within a twelve-month period. (Id., at 3; Doc. 28-6, at 2). At this meeting, Soutner apparently informed Cutman that some of her absences were FMLA-related but did not identify which dates were covered and did not take any steps to designate the leave as FMLA-approved leave. (Doc. 28, at 7 8).
Soutner received warnings again in July 2015 and February 2016, the latter being a final written warning due to Soutner's accumulation of eight unscheduled absences from February 2015 to February 2016. (Id., at 10-11). During this time period, although Soutner had been approved for intermittent FMLA leave, and additionally, for continuous leave from February 8 to February 10, 2016, [*6]  Soutner failed to designate her absences as FMLA leave pursuant to the department's call- off policy. Rather, Soutner called the department's call-off line and reported that she was not feeling well or referenced the condition for which she needed to be absent, i.e. stomach issues, and she did not report that she wanted to use FMLA leave for the absences. (Id., at 8; Doc. 28-1, at 64-66). She also did not report these absences to FMLASource until well after the 24-hour designation period. (See Doc. 28-22, at 2; Doc. 28-8, at 7 ("Reporting FMLA hours to the department and to FMLASource should be done no later than 24 hours following the absence"). Thus, the absences were deemed unexcused absences and were counted against Soutner pursuant to Hershey Medical's attendance policy.
On May 16, 2016, Soutner reported to work but left before 8:00a.m. when she began experiencing stomach issues. (Doc. 33, at 10). She then emailed Cutman several hours later to explain why she had left work that morning, stating that she was having intestinal distress. (Id.; Doc. 28-20, at 2). Although Soutner emailed Cutman to inform her that she had left work, she did not call in to the department pursuant to the call-off [*7]  procedures. Soutner was also absent the following day, and on May 18, 2016, Cutman terminated Soutner's employment due to Soutner accumulating more than nine unscheduled absences. (Doc. 28, at 15). The termination memo listed, among other dates, the February 8 and 9 absences as well as May 16 and 17, 2016. (Doc. 28-21, at 2). Although Soutner claims that she designated these days as FMLA-protected absences, the employee tracking report indicates that these days were not reported as FMLA absences until well after the designation period. (See Doc. 28-22, at 2; Doc. 28-8, at 7). Indeed, Soutner waited over two months to designate her February 8 and 9 absences as FMLA leave and waited one week to designate her May 16 and 17 absences as FMLA leave. (Doc. 28-22).
On October 5, 2016, Soutner dual-filed a charge of discrimination with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission ("PHRC") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). (Doc. 1, ¶ 4). She received her Right to Sue letter from the EEOC on November 8, 2017. (Id., ¶ 5). Soutner then filed the instant action on February 5, 2018 and filed an amended complaint on November 2, 2018. (Docs. 1, 18). The amended complaint asserts [*8]  claims pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act ("PHRA"), 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 951 et seq., and the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. Soutner claims that Hershey Medical discriminated against her and terminated her because of her disabilities in violation of the ADA and the PHRA. She also asserts that the defendant interfered with her right to take FMLA leave and subsequently terminated her for using FMLA leave.
The parties have now filed cross motions for summary judgment. (Docs. 23, 26). Soutner contends that she is entitled to summary judgment on her FMLA retaliation claim, as the defendant specifically relied on two days—February 8 and 9, 2016—that were protected FMLA days as grounds for her termination in May 2016. For its part, the defendant asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment on all of Soutner's claims against it, as it did not discriminate or terminate Soutner because of her disabilities or because she used FMLA leave. Rather, Hershey Medical argues that Soutner repeatedly failed to designate her absences as FMLA protected leave, and thus, was terminated after accruing a host of unexcused absences in violation of company policy.
After [*9]  a review of the record, we find that there are no genuine disputes of material fact that would preclude summary judgment in the defendant's favor. Rather, the record indicates that Soutner's supervisor engaged in several discussions with her regarding the need to properly document her FMLA time off. Additionally, while Soutner was approved for FMLA leave during intermittent periods between 2014 and 2016, she repeatedly failed to designate her absences as FMLA-protected and failed to follow the department's call-off procedure, which resulted in her accruing unexcused absences that led to her termination. Accordingly, for the following reasons, we will recommend that the defendant's motion be granted, and that the plaintiff's motion be denied.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
The parties have moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Through summary adjudication, a court is empowered to dispose of those claims that do not present a "genuine dispute as to any material fact," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and for which a trial would [*10]  be "an empty and unnecessary formality." Univac Dental Co. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., No. 07-0493, 702 F. Supp. 2d 465, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31615, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2010). The substantive law identifies which facts are material, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis that would allow a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id., at 248-49.
The moving party has the initial burden of identifying evidence that it believes shows an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Conoshenti v. Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2004). Once the moving party has shown that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's claims, "the non-moving party must rebut the motion with facts in the record and cannot rest solely on assertions made in the pleadings, legal memoranda, or oral argument." Berckeley Inv. Group. Ltd. v. Colkitt, 455 F.3d 195, 201 (3d Cir. 2006); accordCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the nonmoving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden at trial," summary judgment is appropriate. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. Summary judgment is also appropriate if the non-moving party provides merely colorable, conclusory, or speculative evidence. [*11]  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. There must be more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the nonmoving party and more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. Id., at 252; see also, Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In making this determination, the Court must "consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Sch., 486 F.3d 791, 794 (3d Cir. 2007).
Moreover, a party who seeks to resist a summary judgment motion by citing to disputed material issues of fact must show by competent evidence that such factual disputes exist. Further, "only evidence which is admissible at trial may be considered in ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Countryside Oil Co., Inc. v. TravelersIns. Co., 928 F.Supp. 474, 482 (D.N.J. 1995). Similarly, it is well-settled that: "[o]ne cannot create an issue of fact merely by . . . denying averments . . . without producing any supporting evidence of the denials." Thimons v. PNC Bank, NA, 254 F. App'x 896, 899 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Thus, "[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported . . ., an adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations or denial." Fireman's Ins. Co. of Newark NJ v. DuFresne, 676 F.2d 965, 968 (3d Cir. 1982); see Sunshine Books, Ltd. v. Temple University, 697 F.2d 90, 96 (3d Cir. 1982). "[A] mere denial is insufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact, and an unsubstantiated doubt as to the veracity of the opposing affidavit is also not sufficient." Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 458 (3d Cir. 1969). Furthermore, "a party resisting a [Rule 56] motion cannot expect to rely merely upon bare assertions, conclusory allegations [*12]  or suspicions." Gans v. Mundy, 762 F.2d 338, 341 (3d Cir. 1985) (citing Ness v. Marshall, 660 F.2d 517, 519 (3d Cir. 1981)).
Further, it is emphatically not the province of the court to weigh evidence, or assess credibility, when passing upon a motion for summary judgment. Rather, in adjudicating the motion, the court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the opposing party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). Where the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, then the non-movant's must be taken as true. Id. Additionally, the court is not to decide whether the evidence unquestionably favors one side or the other, or to make credibility determinations, but instead must decide whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; seealso Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1363. In reaching this determination, the Third Circuit has instructed that:
To raise a genuine issue of material fact . . . the opponent need not match, item for item, each piece of evidence proffered by the movant. In practical terms, if the opponent has exceeded the "mere scintilla" threshold and has offered a genuine issue of material fact, then the court cannot credit the movant's version of events against the opponent, [*13]  even if the quantity of the movant's evidence far outweighs that of its opponent. It thus remains the province of the fact finder to ascertain the believability and weight of the evidence.
Id. In contrast, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." MatsushitaElec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); NAACP v. North Hudson Reg'l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d 464, 476 (3d Cir. 2011).
Finally:
"When confronted with cross-motions for summary judgment . . . 'the court must rule on each party's motion on an individual and separate basis, determining, for each side, whether a judgment may be entered in accordance with the summary judgment standard.' " Transguard Ins. Co. of Am., Inc. v. Hinchey, 464 F. Supp. 2d 425, 430 (M.D. Pa. 2006) (quoting Marciniak v. Prudential Fin. Ins. Co. of Am., 184 Fed. Appx. 266, 270 (3d Cir.2006)). "If review of [the] cross-motions reveals no genuine issue of material fact, then judgment may be entered in favor of the party deserving of judgment in light of the law and undisputed facts." Id. (citing Iberia Foods Corp. v. Romeo, 150 F.3d 298, 302 (3d Cir.1998)).
Pellicano v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., Ins. Operations, 8 F. Supp. 3d 618, 625-26 (M.D. Pa. 2014), aff'd sub nom. Pellicano v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 714 F. App'x 162 (3d Cir. 2017).
It is against these legal benchmarks that we assess the instant motions for summary judgment.

IV. DISCUSSION
As we have noted, Soutner brings four claims against Hershey Medical, asserting that her former employer violated the FMLA and the ADA. Soutner claims that she used protected FMLA leave on several occasions, [*14]  but that the defendant failed to certify these absences as FMLA leave and, instead, used these unexcused absences as the basis for her termination. She also asserts that Hershey Medical discriminated against her and terminated her employment because of her disabilities, without engaging in an interactive process and granting her a reasonable accommodation. Soutner now contends that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on her FMLA retaliation claim, as the defendant explicitly considered two occasions in which she purportedly took FMLA leave in its decision to terminate her employment.
For its part, Hershey Medical contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on all of the plaintiff's claims against it. The defendant asserts that Soutner was not terminated because she used FMLA leave, but rather because, after speaking with her supervisor and having received multiple written warnings, she accrued her ninth unexcused absence in violation of company policy. With respect to the plaintiff's ADA claims, Hershey Medical argues that Soutner's supervisor engaged in a protracted interactive process with her, repeatedly counseling Soutner on her obligation to clearly designate her [*15]  leave requests, something Soutner persistently failed to do, and that Soutner was not terminated because of her disability, but because of her repeated unexcused absences.
After a review of the record, we conclude that there are no genuine disputes of material fact with respect to any of the plaintiff's claims. Instead, the record indicates that Soutner failed to follow Hershey Medical's call-off and FMLA procedures, and therefore accrued unexcused absences that resulted in her termination. Accordingly, we will recommend that the defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted.

A. FMLA Claims
As we have noted, Soutner brings two claims against Hershey Medical under the FMLA. First, she asserts a claim of interference, arguing that the defendant failed to certify some of her absences as FMLA leave, which resulted in her accruing unexcused absences. Additionally, Soutner contends that she was terminated because she used FMLA leave.

1. FMLA Interference
In order to state a claim for interference under the FMLA, a plaintiff must allege:
(1) he or she was an eligible employee under the FMLA; (2) the defendant was an employer subject to the FMLA's requirements; (3) the plaintiff was entitled [*16]  to FMLA leave; (4) the plaintiff gave notice to thedefendant of his or her intention to take FMLA leave; and (5) the plaintiff was denied benefits to which he or she was entitled under the FMLA.
Ross v. Gilhuly, 755 F.3d 185, 191-92 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Johnson v. Cmty. Coll. of Allegheny Cty., 566 F. Supp. 2d 405, 446 (W.D. Pa. 2008)) (emphasis added). A plaintiff must thus show not only that she was entitled to FMLA leave, but that the employer denied her those benefits. Sommer v. The Vanguard Grp., 461 F.3d 397, 399 (3d Cir. 2006). The employee does not need to show that she was treated differently from other employees, and the employer cannot justify the denial of FMLA benefits by establishing a legitimate business purpose for its decision. Id. at 399. Moreover, "[b]ecause the FMLA [interference claim] is not about discrimination, a McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis is not required." Id.
With respect to the employee's obligation to provide proper notice of FMLA leave, employees must follow their employer's usual notice and procedural requirements for requesting FMLA-protected leave, absent unusual circumstances. 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.302(d), 825.303(c). This is true whether the employee's need for leave is foreseeable or unforeseeable. Id. Should an employee fail to follow the employer's notice requirements and no unusual circumstances are present, the employer may deny FMLA-protected leave. Id.; see Hair v. Fayette Cty. of Pennsylvania, 265 F. Supp. 3d 544, 564-65 (W.D. Pa. 2017).
The Third [*17]  Circuit Court of Appeals has emphasized that interference claims are not coterminous with claims of FMLA retaliation, and indeed has explained that "[a]n interference claim is not about discrimination[;] it is only about whether the employer provided the employee with the entitlements guaranteed by the FMLA." Ross, 755 F.3d at 192 (quoting Callison v. City of Phila., 430 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir. 2005)) (alteration in Ross). In plain terms, "for an interference claim to be viable, the plaintiff must show that FMLA benefits were actually withheld." Ross, 755 F.3d at 192.
Here, Soutner contends that Hershey Medical failed to certify some of her absences as FMLA absences, despite her being approved for intermittent FMLA leave. On this score, it is undisputed that Soutner was approved to take intermittent FMLA leave between September 30, 2014 and September 23, 2016. (Doc. 24-2, at 4-5). However, it appears undisputed that Soutner failed to properly comply with Hershey Medical's usual notice policy for requesting FMLA leave on numerous occasions. There is no excuse for this failure on Soutner's part. Significantly, we note that Soutner herself recorded the message for the call-off line, which stated as follows: "Hi, you have reached the call-off line for the care coordination department at the [*18]  MS Hershey Medical Center. Please leave a message including what time off you would like to use, for example, family sick time, FMLA, PTO, et cetera. Thank you." (Doc. 28-1, at 65-66). In addition, the notifications from FMLASource to Soutner regarding her approved FMLA leave stated that the department's call-off procedures must be followed for each absence. (Doc. 28-11, at 2-3; Doc 28-14, at 2 3). However, while Soutner did call the call-off line to report that she would be absent, she did not specify what type of leave she wanted to use for her absences. (Id., at 64-65). Moreover, although Soutner was required to report her absences as FMLA leave to FMLASource within 24 hours (Doc. 28-8, at 7), her employee tracking report indicates that certain days were not reported as FMLA absences until well after the designation period. (See Doc. 28-22, at 2). Indeed, Soutner waited over two months to designate her February 8 and 9 absences as FMLA leave and waited one week to designate her May 16 and 17 absences as FMLA leave. (Id.)
On these facts, we cannot conclude that the defendant interfered with Soutner's rights under the FMLA to take her approved leave. Rather, it is clear from the record that, while [*19]  Soutner was approved to take FMLA leave between September 2014 and September 2016, she did not follow Hershey Medical's FMLA policy or its call-off policy, thereby failing to give the defendant proper notice of her intention to take FMLA leave. Simply put, Soutner's FMLA leave interference claim fails as a matter of law on the fourth element of any such claim, the requirement that the plaintiff gave proper notice to the defendant of her intention to take FMLA leave; Ross v. Gilhuly, 755 F.3d 185, 191-92 (3d Cir. 2014). Given Soutner's failure to comply with this known company policy regarding designation of FMLA leave, Hershey Medical was well within its right to deny Soutner's FMLA leave. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.302(d), 825.303(c); Hair, 265 F.Supp.3d at 564-65. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's FMLA interference claim.

2. FMLA Retaliation
Soutner also contends that the defendant retaliated against her for using FMLA by terminating her employment on May 18, 2016. She specifically relies on the defendant's consideration of her February 8 and 9, 2016 workplace absences, arguing that these absences were protected FMLA absences, and the defendant terminated her based on those absences.
In order to state a claim for retaliation under the FMLA, an employee must [*20]  allege that after taking FMLA-qualifying leave, she was subjected to adverse employment action, including termination other retaliatory action, because she took time away from work for FMLA-qualifying reasons. See, e.g., Freeman v. Phila. Hous. Auth., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100774, 2013 WL 3761274, at *22, (E.D. Pa. July 18, 2018) (describing retaliation claims as those "where an employee requested or took FMLA leave, remained at or returned to work, and then was subject to some type of adverse employment action such as termination or demotion").
To prevail on her FMLA retaliation claim, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing a prima facie case by showing that she invoked a right to FMLA qualifying leave, subsequently suffered an adverse employment decision, and demonstrate that the adverse action was causally related to her invocation of her FMLA rights. Ross, 755 F.3d at 193 (citing Lichtenstein v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 691 F.3d 294, 302 (3d Cir. 2012)). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the employer to show a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the allegedly adverse employment decision. Lichtenstein, 691 F.3d at 302. If the employer satisfies this "minimal burden," id., the plaintiff has the burden of establishing evidence sufficient to cast doubt on the employer's legitimate, non-retaliatory reason. Id.
In the instant case, Soutner cannot prevail on [*21]  her claim of FMLA retaliation. As we have explained with respect to the interference claim, Soutner did not provide the requisite notice to Hershey Medical of her intention to take FMLA leave. She did not follow Hershey Medical's call-off policy or the policy of reporting her absences through FMLASource. Thus, Soutner has failed to show that she properly invoked her rights to FMLA-qualifying leave and cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation. See Grosso v. UPMC, 857 F.Supp.2d 517, 543 (W.D. Pa. 2012) (holding that no reasonable jury could conclude that the plaintiff invoked her right to FMLA leave where she did not give notice to her employer of the assertion of her rights); see also Parrotta v. PECO Energy Co., 363 F.Supp.3d 577, 604 (E.D. Pa. 2019) (holding that "the FMLA[] does not allow a retaliation claim when [the plaintiff] fails to establish that he invoked his rights under the FMLA"). Moreover, given that these February 2016 absences were not designated as FMLA leave, the defendant's consideration of these absences as part of Soutner's termination cannot be considered retaliation for Soutner's use of FMLA leave. Accordingly, Soutner's FMLA retaliation claim fails, and the defendant should be entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

B. ADA Claims1
Soutner also brings claims pursuant [*22]  to the ADA, asserting that the defendant discriminated against her and terminated her because of her disabilities. Specifically, Soutner alleges that the defendant failed to engage in an interactive process with her to discuss an appropriate accommodation for her disabilities, and ultimately terminated her because of her disabilities.2
The purpose of the ADA is to "prevent employment discrimination of qualified individuals on account of their disability." Koller v. Riley Riper Hollin & Colagreco, 850 F. Supp. 2d 502, 512 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). The Act requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, unless the employer demonstrates that such accommodations would impose an undue hardship in the operation of their business." Id. (quoting Fleck v. WILMAC, Corp., No. 10-5562, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54039, at *10 (E.D. Pa. May 19, 2011)).
In order to make out a prima facie claim for workplace discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she is (1) disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer, and (3) has suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of the discrimination. Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 F.3d 177, 185 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Stadtmiller v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc., 491 F. App'x 334, 336 (3d Cir. 2012); Gaul v. LucentTechnologies, Inc., 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir. 1998). A disability can take [*23]  the form of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing under this three-part standard, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action. See Shaner v. Synthes, 204 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 2000) (noting that the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell DouglasCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), applies to ADA disparate treatment and retaliation claims). If a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is given, then the plaintiff must present evidence to demonstrate that the defendant's reasons were pretext for its unlawful action. Id. The plaintiff may meet this burden by identifying evidence that allows a factfinder either to disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate justification, or to conclude that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a "but for" cause of the employment action. Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994). This "but for" standard of causation sets an exacting benchmark for these claims.
Moreover, when a plaintiff brings a failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA, the plaintiff must show that "(1) [s]he was disabled and h[er] employer [*24]  knew it; (2) [s]he requested an accommodation or assistance; (3) h[er] employer did not make a good faith effort to assist; and (4) [s]he could have been reasonably accommodated." Capps v. Mondelez Global, LLC, 847 F.3d 144, 157 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Armstrong v. Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital, 438 F.3d 240, 246 (3d Cir. 2006) (internal quotations omitted)).
The ADA also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who oppose an act or practice made unlawful by the ADA or because the employee has made a charge under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a); Shellenberger v. SummitBancorp, Inc., 318 F.3d 183, 188 (3d Cir. 2003) ("it is unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee based upon the employee's opposition to anything that is unlawful under the ADA."). Although requesting a reasonable accommodation does not appear to "fit[ ] within the literal language of the statute," Soileua v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1997), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has held that making a good-faith request for an accommodation is protected activity for purposes of the ADA's anti-retaliation provision. Shellenberger, 318 F.3d at 191.
In order to make out a prima facie case of illegal retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show (1) protected employee activity, (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity, and (3) a causal relationship between the protected activity and the adverse action. Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 759 (3d Cir. 2004); Fogleman v. Mercy Hosp., Inc., 283 F.3d 561, 567-68 (3d Cir. 2002). The same McDonnell [*25]  Douglas burden-shifting framework described above with respect to ADA discrimination claims also applies to ADA retaliation claims. In all cases involving retaliation, a plaintiff must prove that retaliatory animus played a role in the employer's decision-making process and that it had a determinative effect on the outcome of the process. Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 501 (3d Cir. 1997). That burden always remains with the plaintiff. Id.
The Third Circuit has summarized the showing that a defendant must make in order to obtain summary judgment on a claim of ADA retaliation:
[T]he employer must show that the trier of fact could not conclude, as a matter of law, (1) that retaliatory animus played a role in the decisionmaking process and (2) that it had a determinative effect on the outcome of that process. This may be accomplished by establishing the plaintiff's inability to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to either: (1) one or more elements of the plaintiff's prima facie case or, (2) if the employer offers a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action, whether the employer's proffered explanation was a pretext for retaliation.
Id.
In the instant case, it appears that Soutner may be conflating her request [*26]  for an accommodation under the ADA with her request for FMLA leave. Indeed, nothing in the record indicates that Soutner requested an accommodation apart from her requests for FMLA-qualifying leave. While we recognize that "a request for FMLA leave may qualify, under certain circumstances, as a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA," Capps, 847 F.3d at 156-57, the record reveals that Soutner "ask[ed] to take time off work," and that she was able to take the time off, subject only to Hershey's requirement that she properly and timely designate her FMLA leave, something she failed to do on numerous occasions. (Doc. 28-1, at 95). Indeed, Soutner was approved to take intermittent FMLA leave from September 2014 through September 2016. (Doc. 24-2, at 4-5). Moreover, it is clear that Soutner's supervisor engaged in discussions with her on several occasions concerning the need for her to take leave for her disabilities. (Doc. 28-1, at 94, 105 06, 108, 117, 129). Indeed, Cutman met with Soutner in November 2014, July 2015, and February 2016 to discuss her absences and reiterate that Soutner could use FMLA leave when appropriate, provided that she complied with company policies for timely designating [*27]  FMLA leave. Thus, we cannot conclude that the defendant failed to engage in the interactive process with Soutner or failed to grant her request for a reasonable accommodation, as her FMLA leave that she requested was approved.
Additionally, Soutner has not made a prima facie showing of retaliation under the ADA. We note that to the extent Soutner's request for FMLA leave constitutes a request for an accommodation under the ADA, this request constitutes protected activity. See Shellenberger, 318 F.3d at 191. Soutner's use of FMLA leave would also constitute protected activity. See Cartagena v. Temple Univ. Hospital, Inc., 389 F.Supp.3d 341, 350 (E.D. Pa. 2019). However, Soutner cannot establish a causal connection between her requests for FMLA leave and her termination. Nor can she establish a connection between her use of FMLA leave and her termination. To the contrary, Soutner's requests for intermittent FMLA leave were continuously granted through FMLASource. (Doc. 24-2, at 4-5). However, Soutner repeatedly failed to designate her leave as FMLA leave in accordance with Hershey Medical's FMLA policy. Indeed, the employee tracking report shows that Soutner waited long after the 24-hour timeframe to designate her leave as FMLA leave. (See Doc. 28-22, at 2; Doc. 28-8, at 7). Additionally, as [*28]  discussed above, Soutner failed to follow the department's internal call-off procedures when reporting her absences, even though she was well aware of these policies since she had actually recorded the phone message which described the policies for leave applicants.
In any event, even if Soutner was able to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination or retaliation, Hershey Medical has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for her termination—Soutner's continuous violations of the company's attendance policy. In fact, Soutner received several warnings prior to the Final Written Warning that she received in February 2016, which put her on notice that she had accrued eight unexcused absences, several of which she later claimed to be covered by her FMLA leave. (Doc. 28-10, at 2; Doc 28-12, at 2; Doc. 28-16, at 2). While Soutner contends that her unexcused absences that counted against her attendance were protected under the FMLA, and that any nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for this unlawful action, as we have explained, Soutner did not properly designate these absences as FMLA-protected, and thus Hershey Medical was within its rights to deny her leave. Thus, [*29]  Soutner has not shown that Hershey Medical's reason for her termination was a pretext for discrimination or retaliation. Indeed, in this setting a persistent failure to abide by company leave policies can defeat an ADA claim and justify termination of the worker. See Amadio v. Ford Motor Co., 238 F.3d 919, 921 (7th Cir. 2001).
In sum, the record shows that while Soutner was approved for various stints of intermittent FMLA leave from 2014 to 2016, she repeatedly failed to designate her absences in accordance with Hershey Medical's FMLA policy and its attendance policy. Soutner's supervisor met with her on multiple occasions to discuss these policies and to encourage Soutner to apply for FMLA leave if needed. Despite these discussions, Soutner persistently failed to comply with these policies, which resulted in her accruing more than nine unexcused absences in violation of Hershey Medical's attendance policy and resulted in her termination. Because Hershey was legally entitled to require Soutner to comply with these neutral and uniform workplace policies, and Soutner failed to comply, her claims fail as a matter of law and we recommend that summary judgment be granted to the defendants on all of the plaintiff's claims.

V. RECOMMENDATION
