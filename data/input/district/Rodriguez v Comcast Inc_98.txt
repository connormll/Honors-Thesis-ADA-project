ORDER REGARDING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Regarding Docket No. 29
Defendant Comcast Communications Management LLC ("Comcast") filed a motion for summary judgment. Having carefully considered the parties' papers, relevant legal authority, and the record in the case, and having had the benefit of oral argument, the Court hereby GRANTS Comcast's motion for the reasons set forth below.
In her opposition to Comcast's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff Gloria Rodriguez ("Plaintiff") stipulates to dismissing [*2]  her cause of action for age discrimination. (Dkt. 31 at 6.) Therefore, the Court DISMISSES her fourth cause of action for age discrimination.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff worked as a customer service representative for Comcast until her employment was terminated on December 15, 2015. Plaintiff suffered a brain hemorrhage in March of 2015 and was on leave from work until the termination of her employment. She contends that Comcast terminated her employment in violation of the California Fair Housing and Employment Act ("FEHA"), California Government Code § 12940, et seq. In opposition to Comcast's pending motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff argues that she was requesting, as an accommodation, additional time off until April 19, 2016 and that Comcast's failure to do so constitutes discrimination based on her disability and failure to provide a reasonable accommodation in violation of FEHA.
On September 11, 2015, Plaintiff applied for social security disability insurance ("SSDI") payments. (Dkt. 30-1 (Declaration of Gloria Rodriguez) at ¶ 11; see also Dkt. 42 (Plaintiff's documents from the Social Security Administration ("SSA")) at p. 8.) Plaintiff represented to the SSA that she was disabled due to brain cavernous malformation, double [*3]  vision, headaches, slow speech, memory loss, numbness on the left side of her face, unsteady gate, impaired vision in the left eye, and a hernia. (Dkt. 40 (Declaration of Marianne C. Koepf attaching Plaintiff's SSDI Records), Ex. D at SSA 006.) She asserted to the SSA that she was unable to work starting on March 2, 2015. (Dkt. 40, Ex. D at SSA 006-7.)
On December 9, 2015, Plaintiff was evaluated by Dr. Thanh Quoc Tran for a neurology disability evaluation. (Id. at SSA 026-028.) Plaintiff appears to have reported to Dr. Tran that after her operation in April 2015, she continued to have poor balance, daily headaches, poor memory, and left face numbness and that she was not able to continue to work. (Id. at SSA 026, 028.) During a psychological disability evaluation for SSDI benefits conducted on December 14, 2015, Plaintiff reported that she continued to experience headaches, dizziness, decreased balance, numbness on the left side of her head and face, and decreased ability to produce tears from her left eye. (Dkt. 40, Ex. D at SSA 021.) She further told the psychological disability evaluator that she was unable to return to work due to her physical health problems and cognitive symptoms. [*4]  (Id. at SSA 022.) The psychological disability evaluator also noted that she reported forgetfulness and decreased concentration since her brain surgery. (Id. at SSA 024.) There is no mention in this report that Plaintiff or her treating doctors reported that she was expected to improve and be ready to return to work without any restrictions by April 19, 2016.
The SSA determined in January 2016 that Plaintiff was disabled as of March 2, 2015 and that medical improvement was not expected. (Dkt. 40, Ex. D. at SSA 018-19; see also Dkt. 29-1, Ex. A (Rodriguez Depo.) at 133:14-18, Ex. 11.) Plaintiff learned that the SSA approved her application for disability benefits on February 21, 2016. (Dkt. 30-1 at ¶ 11; see also Dkt. 42 at pp. 12-16.) The letter informing her of the SSA's determination that she is disabled stated that it was important for her to report any changes in her condition to the SSA, including that fact that her health had improved if that occurred. (Dkt. 42 at p. 13.) As of January 24, 2017, Plaintiff was continuing to receive monthly SSDI checks, and she understood that she would continue to receive those checks for the foreseeable future. (Dkt. 29-1, Ex. A (Rodriguez Depo.) [*5]  at134:1-9.)
In her declaration signed on October 14, 2017, Plaintiff represented that was still receiving checks from the SSA. (Dkt. 30-1, ¶ 34.) Comcast argues that Plaintiff is continuing to receive SSDI benefits from the SSA. (Dkt. 29-2 (Declaration of Marianne C. Koepf), Ex. B.) Plaintiff confirmed at the hearing on Comcast's motion for summary judgment that she is still receiving monthly SSDI payments and that she has not informed the SSA about any improvement in her disabling conditions.

ANALYSIS

A. Applicable Legal Standard on Motion for Summary Judgment.
A principal purpose of the summary judgment procedure is to identify and dispose of factually unsupported claims. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Summary judgment is proper when the "pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations, and is required to draw all inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party." Freeman v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997).
The party moving for summary [*6]  judgment bears the initial burden of identifying those portions of the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. An issue of fact is "genuine" only if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact finder to find for the non-moving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A fact is "material" if it may affect the outcome of the case. Id. at 248. If the party moving for summary judgment does not have the ultimate burden of persuasion at trial, that party must produce evidence which either negates an essential element of the non-moving party's claims or that party must show that the non-moving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial. Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000).
Once the moving party meets his or her initial burden, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and, by its own evidence, "set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). In order to make this showing, the non-moving party must "identify with reasonable particularity the evidence that precludes summary judgment." Keenan v. Allan, 91 F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. 1996). In addition, the party seeking to establish a genuine issue of material fact must take care to adequately point [*7]  a court to the evidence precluding summary judgment because a court is "not required to comb the record to find some reason to deny a motion for summary judgment." Carmen v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). If the non-moving party fails to point to evidence precluding summary judgment, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.

B. Comcast's Motion for Summary Judgment.

1. Whether Plaintiff Can Show Demonstrate She Was Qualified to Perform the Essential Functions of Her Job.
Plaintiff brings causes of action for disability discrimination, failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, and failure to engage in the interactive process under FEHA. Each of these causes of action requires Plaintiff to demonstrate that she was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodations. See Green v. State, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 264, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007) ("FEHA and the [Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA")] both limit their protective scope to those employees with a disability who can perform the essential duties of the employment position with reasonable accommodation."); see also Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (requiring Plaintiff to prove a reasonable accommodation existed that would enable plaintiff to perform her job in order to defeat summary [*8]  judgment on all three types of claims under FEHA).
Comcast contends that Plaintiff is precluded from demonstrating that she is qualified and could perform the essential duties of her job under FEHA in light of the fact that she applied for and is receiving SSDI benefits. In Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff's pursuit of SSDI benefits does not automatically estop her from pursuing an ADA claim. Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 797. In fact, the law does not even erect a strong presumption against an SSDI recipient's success under the ADA. Id. The Supreme Court reasoned that "there are too many situations in which an SSDI claim and an ADA claim can comfortably exist side by side." Id. at 802-03. In determining whether an applicant is disabled, the SSA does not determine whether the applicant could have performed his job with "reasonable accommodation," a major factor which the ADA takes into account. Id. at 803. Some examples of reasonable accommodations under the ADA, as noted by the Court, include part-time or modified work schedules and the acquisition or modification of equipment or devices. Id. at 803. As a result, "an ADA suit claiming that the plaintiff can perform her job with [*9]  reasonable accommodation may well prove consistent with an SSDI claim that the plaintiff could not perform her own job . . . without it. Id. (emphasis in original). Additionally, "the nature of an individual's disability may change over time, so that a statement about that disability at the time of an individual's application for SSDI benefits may not reflect an individual's capacities at the time of the relevant employment decision." Id. at 805.
However, "in some cases an earlier SSDI claim may turn out to genuinely conflict with an ADA claim." Id. The Court noted that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that she is a qualified individual — a person who, with or without reasonable accommodations, can perform the essential functions of her job. Id. at 806. The Social Security Act defines "disability" as an "inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any . . . physical or mental impairment which . . . has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months." 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(1)(A). By making a sworn assertion in an application for SSDI benefits that she is disabled, i.e., unable to engage in gainful employment for at least twelve months, a plaintiff "will appear [*10]  to negate an essential element of her ADA case . . . if she does not offer a sufficient explanation." Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 806. Therefore, the Supreme Court held:
When faced with a plaintiff's previous sworn statement asserting "total disability" or the like, the court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary elements of an ADA claim. To defeat summary judgment, that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff's good faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless "perform the essential functions" of her job, with or without "reasonable accommodation."
Id. at 807.
Here, the Court finds that there is an apparent inconsistency between Plaintiff's claim of disability to the SSA and her current contention that, when Comcast terminated her employment, she merely needed four more months of leave and that she would be able to perform her job at Comcast with no restrictions by April 19, 2016. Plaintiff argues that her request for leave from Comcast until April 19, 2016 was a reasonable accommodation that was not, and could not be, considered by the SSA. However, her proffered explanation does [*11]  not resolve the apparent inconsistency. Cf. Stallings v. Detroit Public Schools, 658 Fed. Appx. 221, 226 (6th Cir. 2016) (finding that it was "incongruous" for the "plaintiff to claim that on September 10" that she could perform her essential job functions with the accommodation of four months' leave, "only to claim on the 18th that she would remain incapacitated even with the benefit of that accommodation.")
In reliance on reliance on Norris v. Allied-Sysco Food Services, Inc., 948 F. Supp. 1418 (N.D. Cal 1996), Plaintiff argues that it would be inequitable to for her to choose between applying for disability payments and the uncertainties of a lawsuit to bring a disability discrimination claim. Her reliance on Norris is misplaced. In Norris, the court was "gravely" troubled by an apparent inconsistency between the plaintiff's application for and receipt of State disability payments based on representations that she was totally disabled from all work and her representations at trial that she could perform the essential functions of her job. Id. at 1445. Nevertheless, after a comprehensive examination of the factual background, including the fact that Plaintiff sought but was denied an accommodation of working from home or part-time, the Court found that it would be unfair:
to force an employee who can perform his job with reasonable accommodations [*12]  by who has been refused accommodation by his employer to choose between seeking disability benefits and gambling on the uncertainty of an ADA lawsuit.
Id. at 1447-48. Unlike the plaintiff in Norris, Plaintiff did not request a modification to work from home or otherwise alter her duties or work environment such that she would have been able to work while simultaneously being considered disabled for purposes of SSDI benefits without those modifications. Moreover, the Court notes that in mid-December 2015 - when she claims that Comcast terminated her employment in violation of FEHA — Plaintiff made representations to medical evaluators for the SSA about her disabling conditions. (Dkt. 40, Ex. D at SSA 021-24, 026-28.) Plaintiff did not mention to either of these doctors that she expected to fully recuperate within four months or that she would be able to work without any restrictions by April 2016. (Id.) The SSA accepted her representations regarding the permanence of her disabling conditions. (Id. at SSA 019 (finding Plaintiff is disabled under the Social Security Act and that medical improvement was not expected).)
Additionally, the Court notes that Plaintiff is still receiving SSDI benefits. If her [*13]  condition had improved and if she had been able to return to work at Comcast full-time without any restrictions, she had an obligation to inform the SSA of her improvement. See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1588(a)(1) (claimant has responsibility to report changes to the SSA, and if claimant is entitled to cash benefits because of a disability, she or he should promptly tell the SSA if her or his condition improves); see also Lincoln v. Momentum Systems Ltd., 86 F. Supp. 2d 421, 430 (2000) (noting Plaintiff's obligation to inform the SSA if his condition improved and finding that his failure to do so estopped him from bringing his claims for disability discrimination); see also E.E.O.C. v. Greater Baltimore Med. Ctr., Inc., 477 Fed. Appx. 68, 75 (4th Cir. 2012) ("Assuming that [plaintiff] believed in good faith that his SSDI application was accurate, this belief must somehow have been consistent with his subsequent failure to notify SSA that he was no longer disabled."). Plaintiff confirmed at the hearing that she has not informed the SSA of any improvement in her disabling conditions. Therefore, by continuing to receive SSDI benefits, Plaintiff is continuing to make representations that she is disabled, well beyond her proffered return to work date of April 19, 2016. Such representations directly conflict with her current position in this lawsuit.
The Court is sympathetic [*14]  to Plaintiff because she was likely in a difficult financial position after Comcast terminated her employment. However, because she made a decision to apply for SSDI benefits and to continue accept monthly SSDI payments, Plaintiff cannot now make assertions to prevail in this litigation which directly contradict those she made to convince the SSA of her disabling conditions. After carefully examining the record and considering Plaintiff's proffered explanation, the Court finds that she fails to provide a sufficient explanation for her conflicting statements. Plaintiff's representations to the SSA eliminate a question of fact as to whether she was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodations, when Comcast terminated her employment. Plaintiff was disabled and unable to work when Comcast terminated her employment, and even a reasonable accommodation of leave until April 19, 2016 would not have allowed her to return to work, given that Plaintiff's disability prevented her from working and allowed her to continue to receive SSDI benefits. Accordingly, the Court grants Comcast's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's first, second, [*15]  and third causes of action under FEHA.

2. Plaintiff's Retaliation Cause of Action.
To succeed on a claim of retaliation under FEHA, "a plaintiff must show (1) he or she engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). Plaintiff contends that her requests for accommodations constitute the requisite "protected activity." However, California courts have held that requests for accommodation, standing alone, do not constitute a "protected activity" and, thus, are insufficient to state a claim for retaliation under FEHA. See Rope v. Auto-Chlor System of Washington, Inc, 220 Cal. App. 4th 635, 652, 163 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392 (2013) ("[W]e find no support in the regulations or case law for the proposition that a mere request — or even repeated requests — for an accommodation, without more, constitutes a protected activity sufficient to support a claim for retaliation in violation of FEHA"); see also Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 381, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015).
Although the California legislature amended FEHA in response to Rope, effective January 1, 2016, this amendment was a substantive change that does not apply retroactively. Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 245-47, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016); see also Jaffe v. Sedgwick Claims Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116445, 2017 WL 3160561, *3 (C.D. Cal. July 24, 2017); Mohsin v. California Dep't of Water Res., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102119, 2016 WL 4126721, *7 n. 2 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2016). The amendment in 2016 was a change and not a clarification in the [*16]  law, as Plaintiff contends. Moore, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 247. Plaintiff has not cited to, and the Court did not find, any authority contrary to both Rope and Moore. Therefore, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether she engaged in a protected activity. Accordingly, the Court grants Comcast's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's fifth cause of action for retaliation.

3. Plaintiff's Derivative Causes of Action.
Because the Court finds that Plaintiff cannot maintain her causes of action for disability discrimination or for retaliation, her derivative claims for failure to prevent discrimination and termination in violation of public policy in contravention of FEHA fail as well. The Court, thus, grants Comcast's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's sixth and seventh causes of action.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Comcast's motion for summary judgment. The Court will issue a separate judgment in favor of Comcast. The Clerk shall close the file.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
