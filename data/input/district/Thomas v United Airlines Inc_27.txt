Opinion



Opinion and Order Granting Summary Judgment
The motion by Defendant United Airlines for summary judgment is granted. Dkt 36. Its prior motion to dismiss is denied as moot. Dkt 25.
1. Background
Plaintiff Kim Thomas is a former employee of Defendant United Airlines. Thomas is Black and suffers from ulcerative colitis. She claims in this action that United discriminated against her on account of both her race and her disability.
Thomas worked at United from 1992 until her termination in 2019. She claims to have made numerous complaints of racism and harassment during her employment with United. These were directed at her manager, Heather Holmes, and her HR representative, Amanda Lye. See Dkts 36-2 at 8 (Thomas deposition), 38-3 (email complaint) & 38-11 at 2 (Thomas affidavit). Like Thomas, Holmes is Black. The record isn't clear as to Lye.
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease of the large intestine with symptoms ranging from stool urgency to persistent [*2]  diarrhea. Dkt 38-11 at 2. Thomas received intermittent leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act as early as 2017. Her FMLA status permitted her to take job-protected leave once a week (for up to two days) for her condition. Dkt 36-1 at 6-9 (FMLA approval).
As an employee of United, Thomas had pass-travel privileges permitting her to travel standby on United flights. In most cases United prohibits employees from using pass-travel privileges while on sick leave. The airline also reserves the right to "investigate any travel conducted while on sick leave." Id at 47 (pass-travel guidelines). Thomas was ultimately terminated after investigation into her attempted use of such privileges on July 20, 2019.
a. July 20th incident
Thomas was scheduled to work an eight-and-a-half-hour shift on July 20th. Instead, she planned to travel to Detroit that day. Thomas traded over six hours of her shift with a colleague to free her schedule. Id at 16. She conferred with another colleague about trading the remaining two hours but never completed the trade. Id at 43. This meant that Thomas was expected to work two midday hours that day. Even so, she booked a standby reservation for a flight from Houston to Detroit on [*3]  the morning of the 20th, which rolled over to additional flights that morning and early afternoon. Dkt 36-2 at 34-35.
Thomas claims to have decided not to travel after having taken ill with diarrhea and vomiting while waiting for her flight. She further claims to have driven herself to the emergency room at HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest, in part because her heart was also racing. Id at 36-37. She says that she was only briefly there and given something to stop her vomiting. Id at 37.
Following this alleged hospital visit, Thomas called United's sick line to apply her FMLA intermittent leave to the two hours of her shift that she missed earlier that day. But United discovered that Thomas had arranged to use her pass-travel privileges that same day. It thus opened an investigation into a potential violation. Dkt 36-1 at 49.
b. August 6th meeting
On August 6, 2019, Holmes (as Thomas's manager) conducted the first of two important in-person meetings with Thomas as part of United's investigation. Both Thomas and Holmes were present in person, and an HR representative named Laurie Ledonne was present by phone. Thomas says that Ledonne warned Thomas (apparently after asking to retrieve her phone) that [*4]  she wasn't allowed to leave the meeting room. She also says that she asked Holmes during the meeting if she could use the restroom, which Holmes refused. Fearing that she'd be fired if she left without permission, Thomas claims to have soiled herself during the meeting. Dkt 36-2 at 15, 18.
Thomas was also asked to submit a written statement as part of this meeting. She complied, submitting a handwritten statement and an email addendum. Dkt 36-1 at 22-23. United found inconsistencies between these statements and the company's records. It then placed Thomas on paid administrative suspension on August 7th pending further investigation.
Thomas claims to have informed Holmes on August 7th that she soiled herself during the meeting the day prior. She says that Holmes reacted with vulgarity and hostility and forcefully ordered her to leave. Dkt 38-11 at 3.
c. August 16th meeting
The second meeting took place on August 16, 2019. Holmes scheduled this meeting on August 13th and asked that Thomas bring with her the papers from her July 20th emergency-room visit. Dkt 36-1 at 24. As it turns out, Thomas then visited the hospital that same day for her ulcerative colitis, staying overnight until the [*5]  14th. Dkt 36-5 at 6.
When Thomas arrived to the meeting on August 16th, she hadn't brought the requested papers but had instead prepared another written statement. She was reportedly looking weak and claims to have asked Holmes to reschedule. She presented her hospital bracelet and a doctor's note that stated she shouldn't return to work until August 22nd. Dkt 36-2 at 14-15; see also Dkt 38-9. Holmes allegedly insisted that Thomas attend the meeting that day, saying that her failure to do so would be taken as a failure to cooperate in the investigation. Dkt 36-2 at 14-15.
d. Subsequent termination
Thomas faxed her emergency-room discharge papers to United's medical department on August 20th. See Dkt 36-1 at 31-32. The medical department attempted to authenticate the papers. In doing so, personnel for the department contacted employees at HCA Northwest, all of whom said that Thomas wasn't seen at the hospital on July 20th. Id at 56-57; see also Dkts 36-3 & 36-4.
Holmes conducted a third meeting on September 7th with Thomas to give her an opportunity to explain the purported visit to the emergency room on July 20th. Thomas maintained that she had visited the hospital that day but provided [*6]  no further information to verify that claim. See Dkt 36-1 at 34-35.
United concluded from its investigation that Thomas (i) falsely claimed that she went to the HCA emergency room on July 20th, (ii) submitted a falsified document to support her purported visit, and (iii) refused to cooperate with the investigation. It also concluded that this conduct merited termination and initiated the termination process. Thomas was officially terminated on October 31, 2019. The final decision was rendered by Michael Mayo, who is Black. Id at 49-51.
Thomas appealed this termination through the grievance process. At a hearing on her appeal, Thomas claimed that HCA employees had said that she never visited the hospital on July 20th because she had a confidentiality agreement with the hospital. Her grievance was denied. Id at 58-59.
Following this hearing, HCA produced medical records in response to a subpoena from United. The records indicated that Thomas visited the hospital on several dates in 2019, including overnight on August 13th and 14th—but not July 20th. See Dkt 36-5 at 6. The records also showed that HCA generates account numbers that are unique to each patient visit. The discharge papers that Thomas [*7]  submitted for the purported July 20th visit bore an account number of BN0243033660. Dkt 36-1 at 32. That, in point of fact, is the same number from the records of the overnight hospital visit on August 13th and 14th. And that visit occurred just a few days before Thomas faxed the purported discharge papers to United's medical department on August 20th. See Dkt 36-6.
e. Procedural history
Thomas filed a charge with the EEOC in February 2020 and was issued a notice of right to sue in early 2021. She then filed this lawsuit against United.
She asserts claims under both federal and state law for race discrimination, disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and various forms of retaliation. The federal claims proceed under Title VII and the Americans With Disabilities Act, while the state claims proceed under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act. Dkt 21.
United has moved for dismissal of the failure-to-accommodate and retaliation claims. Dkt 25. It also more recently has moved for summary judgment on all claims. Dkt 36. The motion for summary judgment being sufficient to address all claims by Thomas on the legal merits, the motion to dismiss needn't be independently considered. [*8] 
2. Legal standard
Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a court to enter summary judgment when the movant establishes that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." A fact is material if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Sulzer Carbomedics Inc v Oregon Cardio-Devices Inc, 257 F3d 449, 456 (5th Cir 2001), quoting Anderson v Liberty Lobby Inc, 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). And a dispute is genuine if the "evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Royal v CCC & R Tres Arboles LLC, 736 F3d 396, 400 (5th Cir 2013), quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
The summary judgment stage doesn't involve weighing the evidence or determining the truth of the matter. The task is solely to determine whether a genuine issue exists that would allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Smith v Harris County, 956 F3d 311, 316 (5th Cir 2020). Disputed factual issues must be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party. Little v Liquid Air Corp, 37 F3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir 1994). All reasonable inferences must also be drawn in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Connors v Graves, 538 F3d 373, 376 (5th Cir 2008).
The moving party typically bears the entire burden to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Nola Spice Designs LLC v Haydel Enterprises Inc, 783 F3d 527, 536 (5th Cir 2015); see also Celotex Corp v Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). But when a motion for summary judgment by a defendant presents a question on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof at trial, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to proffer summary judgment proof establishing [*9]  an issue of material fact warranting trial. Nola Spice, 783 F3d at 536. To meet this burden of proof, the evidence must be both "competent and admissible at trial." Bellard v Gautreaux, 675 F3d 454, 460 (5th Cir 2012).
3. Analysis
a. Race discrimination
Thomas brings claims for race discrimination under Title VII and the THCRA. See 42 USC § 2000e-2(a)(1); Texas Labor Code § 21.051. She doesn't contend that she has direct evidence of discrimination. Her claims must therefore be analyzed under the modified burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp v Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).
Under that framework, a plaintiff must first set forth a prima facie case of discrimination. If the plaintiff does so, discrimination is presumed, with the burden shifting to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the underlying employment action. If the employer offers such a reason, the discriminatory inference disappears, and the plaintiff must present evidence that the employer's asserted reason is mere pretext for racial discrimination. See Davis v Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 383 F3d 309, 316-17 (5th Cir 2004); see also Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center—El Paso v Flores, 612 SW2d 299, 305 (Tex 2020) (applying framework to TCHRA claims). This same framework will apply to the claims for disability discrimination and retaliation.
i. Prima facie case
A prima facie case of race discrimination requires the employee to demonstrate that (i) she is a member of a protected class, (ii) she was [*10]  qualified for the position, (iii) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (iv) she was replaced by someone outside her protected class or treated less favorably than other similarly situated employees outside her class. Bryan v McKinsey & Co Inc, 375 F3d 358, 360 (5th Cir 2004); see also Harris County Hospital Director v Parker, 484 SW3d 182, 196 (Tex App—Houston [14th Dist] 2015, no pet).
Dispute here focuses only on whether Thomas was treated less favorably than other similarly situated employees outside her class. Thomas points to four such employees, all of whom are White. See Dkt 38 at 12-15. United argues that none of them are in fact similarly situated. Dkt 36 at 17-20.
The Fifth Circuit instructs that a similarly situated employee must present "nearly identical circumstances" to the plaintiff. Lee v Kansas City Southern Railroad Co, 574 F3d 253, 260 (5th Cir 2009) (citations omitted). This is a high bar to meet, requiring proof that the two employees "held the same job or responsibilities, shared the same supervisor or had their employment status determined by the same person, and have essentially comparable violation histories." Ibid. Texas law follows the same standard. Flores, 612 SW2d at 312.
The most similar employee Thomas presents is Shannon Giannette, whose surname is sometimes identified in briefing as Gillette. Like Thomas, Giannette submitted falsified documents to United. Unlike Thomas, her employment wasn't [*11]  terminated. But the evidence shows that these distinct employment actions weren't taken under nearly identical circumstances. First, Thomas and Giannette didn't share the same supervisor and so the incidents under investigation proceeded differently. Second, the documents in Giannette's case were submitted for seeking to have her FMLA status certified—not to cover a sick call after FMLA status was previously established. Third, Giannette didn't submit the documents in connection with a potential pass-travel violation. And fourth, Giannette cooperated with United's investigation and ultimately admitted to wrongdoing. Dkt 36-1 at 61-64. Thomas by contrast failed to cooperate, which was part of the reason for her termination. Id at 49-51.
The three other employees Thomas presents are even less similar than Giannette. Donna Shultz did have Holmes for her supervisor, but her alleged misdeed was (Thomas says) threatening Thomas with a knife. Dkts 36-1 at 65-67 & 36-2 at 12. That's nowhere near identical to the circumstances resulting in Thomas's termination. As for Kymmy Hucks and Holly Olive, Holmes supervised neither—which distinguishes each from the outset. In addition, although Hucks [*12]  was found to have committed a pass-travel violation, she didn't submit falsified documents or lie about visiting a hospital. Dkt 36-1 at 60. And Olive was merely permitted to leave a meeting for medical reasons. She has no reported violation history for which termination may have been warranted.
Having failed to identify a similarly situated employee, Thomas can't show a prima facie case of race discrimination.
ii. Pretext
Even if Thomas had established a prima facie case, she hasn't presented evidence to show that United's purported legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating her employment were a pretext for discrimination.
To establish pretext, an employee must show that "the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Reeves v Sanderson Plumbing Products Inc, 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (quotation marks and citation omitted). In other words, the explanation "is not the real reason for the adverse employment action." Burton v Freescale Semiconductor Inc, 798 F3d 222, 233 (5th Cir 2015) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The employee "must rebut each discrete reason proffered by the employer." Ibid. Texas law has a somewhat lower standard, requiring proof that race was a motivating factor for the adverse employment action, even if not the only factor. Quantum Chemical Corp v Toennies, 47 SW3d 473, 479-80 (Tex 2001).
United's proffered reasons for termination [*13]  are perfectly legitimate—lying, falsifying documents, and failing to cooperate in its investigation. And there's nothing casting these reasons into doubt. For her part, Thomas sponsors no evidence indicating that her race was the real reason for her termination or that it was even a motivating factor.
In short, nothing in the record indicates that race was in the mind of any employee who participated in the termination process. Indeed, two of the principal employees who participated in that process were in the same protected class as Thomas—Holmes and Michael Mayo—with the former having led the investigation, and the latter having made the ultimate termination decision. See Agoh v Hyatt Corp, 992 F Supp 2d 722, 744 (SD Tex 2014): "When decision makers are in the same protected class as the plaintiff, there is a presumption that unlawful discrimination is not a factor in the discharge."
Summary judgment will be granted on the claims for race discrimination under both federal and Texas law.
b. Disability discrimination
Thomas also brings claims for disability discrimination under the ADA and TCHRA. See 42 USC § 12112; Texas Labor Code § 21.051. The McDonnell Douglas framework again pertains. See Caldwell v KHOU-TV, 850 F3d 237, 241 (5th Cir 2017); see also Quantum Chemical, 47 SW 3d at 476-77, 479-80.
i. Prima facie case
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, the plaintiff [*14]  must show that she (i) has a disability, (ii) was qualified for the job she held, and (iii) was "subject to an adverse employment decision on account of [her] disability." EEOC v LHC Group Inc, 773 F3d 688, 697 (5th Cir 2014); see also Donaldson v Texas Department of Aging & Disability Services, 495 SW3d 421, 436 (Tex App—Houston [1st Dist] 2016, pet denied). The third element requires proof of "a causal connection between an adverse employment action and [the employee's] disability." Rodriguez v Eli Lilly & Co, 820 F3d 759, 765 (5th Cir 2016).
United correctly argues that Thomas has failed to raise a fact issue as to causation. Dkt 36 at 23-24. Much of Thomas's argument on causation is keyed to the actions of Holmes, who supposedly discriminated against Thomas by commencing the investigation that led to her termination. But by her own admission, Thomas didn't tell Holmes that she had ulcerative colitis before this investigation began. See Dkt 36-2 at 17-18 (Thomas deposition). This means that there's no evidence that Holmes even knew that Thomas had a disability when she started the investigation.
Thomas contends that Holmes did indeed "ha[ve] knowledge of Plaintiff's disability," noting that Thomas had exercised her FMLA leave while working under Holmes. Dkt 40 at 3. But she doesn't cite any pertinent record evidence supporting these assertions. And in any event, documents demonstrating that Thomas had FMLA status [*15]  don't indicate that Holmes was aware that Thomas had ulcerative colitis. See Dkt 38-7.
Nor would knowledge of Thomas's disability in itself demonstrate a causal connection. Thomas has had ulcerative colitis since at least 2017. Thomas identifies no evidence indicating that Holmes had, since that time, issued poor performance reviews related to her ulcerative colitis or the leave it sometimes required her to take. She thus doesn't muster a potential showing that Holmes was searching for a reason to fire her because of her condition. To the contrary, see EEOC v Chevron Phillips Chemical Co, 570 F3d 606, 623 (5th Cir 2009) (determining that evidence could support such conclusion in that case). Nor does she show that Holmes or anyone else made comments casting doubt on her value to the company because of her condition. To the contrary, see EEOC v LHC Group Inc, 773 F3d 688, 701 (5th Cir 2014) (determining that comments of such nature can create fact issue on causation). The only evidence indicating potential hostility by Holmes toward Thomas in spite of her disability comes from Thomas herself. See Dkt 38-11 at 3. It's thus self-serving and, without corroboration, insufficient to create a triable issue of fact. See Salazar v Lubbock County, 982 F3d 386, 389 (5th Cir 2020).
The timing matters, too. Holmes didn't initiate an investigation into Thomas's conduct on [*16]  a whim. She initiated an investigation only after Thomas had—by an assertedly remarkable coincidence—called in sick on the same day that she booked a standby reservation for travel. Such conduct certainly suggests that Thomas had engaged in a pass-travel violation, which United policy expressly states may be investigated. Dkt 36-1 at 47.
And while Thomas primarily focuses on Holmes, she wasn't the only United employee involved in the termination process. In fact, Mayo made the ultimate decision on her termination, not Holmes. But Thomas has no evidence that any of these other employees (including Mayo) took into account Thomas's disability at any point.
Thomas can't show a causal connection between her disability and the decision by United to terminate her employment. This means that she hasn't established a prima facie case under either the ADA or TCHRA.
ii. Pretext
Beyond this, Thomas hasn't presented evidence showing that United's proffered reasons for terminating her employment were a pretext for disability discrimination.
Thomas baldly states that "but for Plaintiff's disability . . . Ms. Holmes would not have launched her crusade against Plaintiff. But for Plaintiff's UC, Ms. Holmes [*17]  would not have initiated her meritless investigation into Plaintiff's attendance." Dkt 38 at 18. The problem is, no exhibits are cited in support of these conclusory assertions. And as just indicated, Thomas has submitted no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Thomas's disability motivated Holmes to initiate the investigation into Thomas's behavior.
Likewise, as determined further above, United's proffered reasons for termination are perfectly legitimate—lying, falsifying documents, and failing to cooperate in its investigation. Nothing casts these reasons into doubt, and Thomas musters nothing to indicate that her ulcerative colitis was the real reason for her termination or that it was even a motivating factor.
Summary judgment will be granted on the claims for disability discrimination under the ADA and TCHRA.
c. Failure to accommodate
Thomas also brings claims for failure to accommodate under the ADA and TCHRA. See 42 USC § 12112; Texas Labor Code § 21.128. Such claim requires proof that (i) the plaintiff has a qualifying disability, (ii) the employer knew of the disability and its consequential limitations, and (iii) the employer failed to make reasonable accommodations for such known limitations. [*18]  Feist v Louisiana, Department of Justice, OAG, 730 F3d 450, 452 (5th Cir 2013); see also Dillard v SNC-Lavalin Engineers & Constructors Inc, 629 SW3d 692, 697 (Tex App—Houston [1st Dist] 2021, no pet).
Thomas claims that United, through Holmes, denied her requested accommodations to use the restroom during the August 6th meeting and to reschedule the August 16th meeting. Among other things, United argues that the failure-to-accommodate claim must fail because Thomas can't show that Holmes knew of Thomas's condition or its symptoms when Thomas requested these accommodations. Dkt 36 at 27. It also argues that Thomas didn't participate in the required interactive process for either requested accommodation. Dkts 36 at 28 & 25 at 5-9. Both arguments are correct.
As to notice, the summary judgment evidence doesn't demonstrate that Holmes (as the person who participated in the interactive process on behalf of United) knew that Thomas had ulcerative colitis—or perhaps more importantly, knew of its consequential limitations (such as stool urgency). See Dkt 36 at 27-28. Again, that Thomas had FMLA status and exercised FMLA leave in the past isn't enough. Thomas hasn't provided evidence that such status would have made Holmes or anyone else at United aware of such limitations. However unpleasant, it was thus incumbent on Thomas to explain her disability and its consequential limitations [*19]  so that Holmes could fully consider whether accommodations were warranted. It isn't enough merely to state, as she did, "I have a condition." See Dkt 36-2 at 17-18.
As to interactive process, "Reasonable accommodation under the ADA is a process, not a one-off event." Scheidler v Indiana, 914 F3d 535, 542 (7th Cir 2019). "[F]or an employer to be liable under the ADA for failure to accommodate limitations caused by an employee's disability, courts have widely held that the employee must request accommodation from the employer and participate in an 'interactive process' with the employer to arrive at a suitable accommodation." Tullos v City of Nassau Bay, 137 F Appx 638, 646 (5th Cir 2005) (citations omitted). The interactive process "should be an ongoing, reciprocal process, not one that ends with the first attempt at accommodation." Dillard v City of Austin, 837 F3d 557, 562 (5th Cir 2016) (citation omitted). And an employer may be held liable under the ADA when it refuses "to engage in a good faith interactive process"—but not when breakdown in the process "is traceable to the employee." Loulseged v Akzo Nobel Inc, 178 F3d 731, 736 (5th Cir 1999).
Here, the purported accommodation requests by Thomas were vague in terms of both condition and potential consequences. For example, see Dkt 36-2 at 15-16 (Thomas deposition). Such circumstances thus didn't lend themselves to the back-and-forth expected in providing accommodations [*20]  under the ADA. Holmes was forced to make an on-the-spot decision about whether to permit Thomas to use the restroom in one instance, and whether to reschedule a meeting in the other. Each was a "one-off event," ending "with the first attempt at accommodation." Scheidler, 914 F3d at 542; Dillard, 837 F3d at 562. No liability attaches for refusal to accommodate in circumstances of such transient nature that don't comprehend an interactive process even taking place.
Summary judgment will be granted on the claims for failure to accommodate under the ADA and TCHRA.
d. Retaliation
Thomas lastly brings claims for retaliation under the ADA, Title VII, and the TCHRA. See 42 USC § 2000e-3(a) (Title VII); 42 USC § 12203(a) (ADA); Texas Labor Code § 21.055. She asserts that United retaliated by firing her for engaging in two protected activities: complaining of discrimination and requesting accommodations. See Dkt 38 at 20.
The McDonnell Douglas framework again applies. Feist, 730 F3d at 454 (Title VII and ADA); Alamo Heights Independent School District v Clark, 544 SW2d 755, 764, 782 (2018) (TCHRA). The parties dispute only whether Thomas has submitted evidence to create a fact issue as to pretext.
To avoid summary judgment as to the pretext inquiry on retaliation claims, "the plaintiff must show 'a conflict in substantial evidence' on the question of whether the employer would not have taken the action 'but for' the protected [*21]  activity." Feist, 730 F3d at 454. But Thomas hasn't submitted any evidence supporting a conclusion that United's decision to terminate her was in any way motivated by (i) the fact that she had complained of discrimination in the past, before she had engaged in a possible pass-travel violation and submitted what United concluded to be falsified documents, or (ii) the fact that she requested accommodations, after the investigation itself had started. She thus hasn't met her burden of showing that United's stated termination reasons were a pretext for retaliating against her for engaging in protected activities.
Summary judgment will be granted on the claims for retaliation under Title VII, the ADA, and the TCHRA.
e. Follow-on consequences
To satisfy its burden under McDonnell Douglas, United presented three legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Thomas, being that she (i) lied about visiting the hospital on July 20th, (ii) submitted falsified discharge papers to support this purported visit, and (iii) failed to participate in United's investigation. It substantiated the first two reasons at the outset of its motion with convincing evidence that Thomas didn't visit the hospital on July 20th and that the discharge [*22]  papers she submitted were indeed falsified. Dkt 36 at 7-8; see also id at 13-16. This includes evidence that HCA employees said Thomas wasn't seen at the emergency room on the 20th. See Dkt 36-1 at 56-57; see also 36-3 & 36-4. It also includes evidence that the discharge papers Thomas submitted for the July 20th visit bore the account number from the overnight visit for August 13th and 14th—a clear indication of forgery. See Dkts 36-1 at 32 & 36-6.
For whatever reason, Thomas continued to insist throughout United's investigation that the discharge papers she submitted with respect to the July 20th visit were legitimate. It would be one thing if she'd left that as a dispute between employer and employee. But her insistence on that fiction poses an entirely different category of problems in this litigation. And that is because Thomas swore an oath to tell the truth in her deposition, subject to penalties of perjury, and then testified, "I absolutely did not forge the document." Dkt 36-2 at 43. And she further testified that she "certainly" was at the hospital on July 20th. Id at 40. Likewise, her declaration submitted with her response, also subject to penalty of perjury, flatly averred, [*23]  "After leaving the airport, on July 20, 2019, I visited the hospital as a result of my ulcerative colitis." Dkt 38-11 at 3.
To the contrary, the evidence on the present record leaves little doubt, if any at all, that Thomas knowingly lied during her deposition and in her declaration about a fact that is central to this case and critical to United's defense.
Claims under Title VII and the ADA are serious. They concern allegations of conduct that—where true—are rightly and strongly condemned. And litigation isn't a game. It's a serious matter in pursuit of justice, which of its nature depends on an honest and legitimate search for the truth. Where that's subverted without consequence, the rule of law is itself denuded. For this reason, Section 1621 of Title 18 of the United States Code in relevant part provides:
Whoever . . . having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to [*24]  be true . . . is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
The United States Supreme Court has long observed, "Perjury is an obstruction of justice; its perpetration well may affect the dearest concerns of the parties before a tribunal." United States v Norris, 300 U.S. 564, 574, 57 S. Ct. 535, 81 L. Ed. 808 (1937). The Fifth Circuit is of similar sentiment, noting that the oath taken before a deposition "is not trivial. The proper administration of justice depends on people testifying truthfully under oath." Brown v Oil States Skagit Smatco, 664 F3d 71, 77 (5th Cir 2011). And the Seventh Circuit aptly notes that "the judicial system cannot tolerate deception from litigants." Neal v LaRiva, 765 F3d 788, 790 (7th Cir 2014).
Deception here began with Thomas during the investigation by United. Would that it ended there. But it didn't. Instead, it plainly involves the additive and amplifying conduct of her counsel, the Kennard Law Firm. It is they who have brought to bear the courts and system of justice that wrongfully targeted United in this action.
Rule 11(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that at least one attorney of record sign all filings made on behalf of a client. This is given force and effect by Rule 11(b), which states:

By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether [*25]  by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:
(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;
(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;
(3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and
(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.
FRCP 11(b) (emphasis added).
All of the following statements made by the Kennard Law Firm in response and surresponse to United's motion are fully subject to Rule 11:
○ "Plaintiff never falsified any documents nor did she lie about visiting the hospital, yet Plaintiff was terminated due to these [*26]  false accusations." Dkt 38 at 15-16 (emphasis added).
○ Stating that Thomas was "wrongfully accused of forgery and dishonesty pertaining to documentation of her prior hospital visit." Id at 11 (emphasis added).
○ Insisting that Thomas "was falsely accused of forging documents." Id at 13 (emphasis added).
○ Stating that Holmes "initiated a false investigation against" Thomas. Id at 17 (emphasis added).
○ "At no point has Plaintiff conceded Defendant's stated reason for termination; Plaintiff has maintained, that while supposed forgery and dishonesty were the reasons for termination cited by Defendant, she has committed no such acts." Dkt 44 at 1 (emphasis added).
By such statements, the Kennard Law Firm has flatly vouched for a perjurious version of the facts in response to the subject motion. And such deception pertains to a topic material to disposition of Thomas's claims in this action. By stating that Thomas was falsely accused of forgery and by continuing to insist that she visited the hospital on July 20th, the Kennard Law Firm is plainly contesting the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Thomas that United presented to satisfy its burden under McDonnell Douglas. And it's also attempting [*27]  to bolster arguments concerning Thomas's prima facie case. See Dkt 38 at 17 (causation).
Quite glaring in this respect—especially given the stark and heavy emphasis placed upon it by United—there's no attempt at all in response to explain why HCA employees said Thomas wasn't at the hospital on July 20th, or how her submitted discharge papers purportedly for that day came to bear the account number from the overnight visit of August 13th and 14th. See Dkts 38 & 44. The Kennard Law Firm is thus complicit, having sponsored an argument in briefing wholly dependent upon perjured testimony and forged documents. This is contrary to the commands of Rule 11(b)(3) & (4). Indeed, this litigation wouldn't have proceeded to this point but for that conduct by this law firm. And more, Thomas, as the client, likely wouldn't have been emboldened to believe that false testimony under oath could proceed without consequence.
A first step in the inquiry will thus be as to what, if any, sanction is appropriate to impose upon the Kennard Law Firm. United is instructed below that it may, if desired, bring a motion under Rule 11(c) for sanctions against the Kennard Law Firm for the entirety of its legal fees and expenses expended in [*28]  this litigation, or any lesser amount that can properly be established under the law.
Reserved at present, but nonetheless under advisement, is whether to refer this order and case file to the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, so that he may consider whether Thomas should be prosecuted for the crime of perjury or any other offense that he deems appropriate. For example, see Neal, 765 F3d at 791; A.V. by Versace Inc v Gianni Versace SpA, 446 F Supp 2d 252 (SDNY 2006); Brown & Brown Inc v Ali, 592 F Supp 2d 1009, 1051 (ND Ill 2009). United may in its motion state whether it believes such reference is appropriate in this instance, with citation of authority in support.
The Kennard Law Firm will have an opportunity in response to present for consideration any argument in contravention or mitigation of sanctions. See FRCP 11(c).
4. Conclusion
The motion by Defendant United Airlines for summary judgment is GRANTED. Dkt 36.
Its partial motion to dismiss is DENIED AS MOOT. Dkt 25.
This action will be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. Final judgment will enter on a later day. The matter will at present be retained on the docket to consider whether and the extent to which sanctions are warranted in this litigation.
United Airlines is INSTRUCTED that it may, if desired, bring a motion for sanctions against the Kennard Law Firm for the entirety [*29]  of its legal fees and expenses expended in this litigation, or such lesser amount as appropriate under Rule 11. It may also state whether it believes reference of Plaintiff Kim L. Thomas to the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas is appropriate, with citation of authority in support.
Such motion must be brought within a reasonable time not to exceed twenty-one days, absent reasonable extension received upon request. United may in this respect request reasonable discovery and attendant deadlines necessary to a well-founded motion.
So Ordered.
Signed on March 31, 2023, at Houston, Texas.

United States District Judge
