Opinion


LETTER TO COUNSEL
Dear Counsel:
Now pending before the Court is the Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion") (ECF No. 62) filed by the Defendant, City of Annapolis ("City").1 Having considered the submissions of the parties (ECF Nos. 62, 75 & 81), I find that a hearing is unnecessary. See Loc. R. 105.6. For the reasons set forth below, the City's Motion will be denied.

I. Introduction
Plaintiff William C. Stansbury ("Stansbury") is a former employee of the City who worked in the Department of Public Works ("DPW") in the position of "Equipment Operator I." (See ECF No. 62-1 at 5.) During the time of his employment with the City, Stansbury was assigned to the Public Works Division of the DPW, which at the time consisted of three sections: Roadways, Street Sanitation, and Residential Refuse. (Id.) Stansbury was injured on the job in 2007 and again in 2010. As a result of these injuries, Stansbury was unable to lift more than 30 pounds. [*2]  The City placed Stansbury on "light duty" in 2010, allowing him to work without having to perform heavy lifting on a temporary basis. In 2011, Stansbury's "light duty" assignment ended and he requested another "light duty" assignment. The City reassigned him to "the dump," which Stansbury and the City refer to respectively as a "landfill" and a "materials storage area." (See id. & ECF No. 75 at 8.) Stansbury complained about his reassignment to "the dump," but the City did not reassign him to another position. Stansbury was notified of the City's intent to terminate his employment in August 2011. Ultimately, after appealing the City's notice of intent to terminate to the City Civil Service Board, Stansbury elected to take ordinary disability retirement and retired in January 2012.
Stansbury's Amended Complaint (ECF No. 38) contains two counts. Count I alleges that the City discriminated against Stansbury, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). (Id. ¶¶ 71-83.) Count II alleges that that the City retaliated against Stansbury, in violation of the ADA. (Id. ¶¶ 84-88.) The City moves for summary judgment as to both counts.

II. Discussion
"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there [*3]  is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The burden is on the moving party to demonstrate the absence of any genuine dispute of material fact. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970). If sufficient evidence exists for a reasonable jury to render a verdict in favor of the party opposing the motion, then a genuine dispute of material fact is presented and summary judgment should be denied. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). However, the "mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [opposing party's] position" is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Id. at 252. The facts themselves, and the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts, must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007).

A. The City's Affirmative Defense
The City argues that Stansbury's failure to accommodate claim is untimely, and that the City is therefore entitled to summary judgment as to this claim. (ECF No. 62-1 at 16-17.) Before bringing an ADA claim in federal court, a plaintiff must exhaust all administrative remedies. The parties do not dispute that, under the circumstances of this case, Stansbury was required to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [*4]  ("EEOC") within 300 days from the occurrence of an alleged discriminatory act.
Because Stansbury filed his Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC on June 26, 2012, according to the City's argument, "only those acts that occurred between August 31, 2011 and June 26, 2012 are actionable" with regard to the failure to accommodate claim. (ECF No. 62-1 at 17.) The acts that Stansbury complains of in his failure to accommodate claim are his transfer to "the dump" in March 2011 and the transmission of the City's notice of intent to terminate on August 6, 2011. Both of these acts fall outside the applicable limitations period.
Stansbury argues that the City "has forfeited its opportunity to advance an untimeliness argument." (ECF No. 75 at 16.) In Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1982), the Supreme Court held that "filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling." Rule 8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that, "in responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense," including a statute of limitations defense. A party's failure to assert a statute [*5]  of limitations defense in compliance with Rule 8(c) ordinarily results in the waiver of that defense. See Day v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 202, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 164 L. Ed. 2d 376 (2006). But waiver of an affirmative defense is not automatic. Peterson v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l, 759 F.2d 1161, 1164 (4th Cir. 1985). The Fourth Circuit has noted that "there is ample authority in this Circuit for the proposition that absent unfair surprise or prejudice to the plaintiff, a defendant's affirmative defense is not waived when it is first raised in a pre-trial dispositive motion." Brinkley v. Harbour Recreation Club, 180 F.3d 598, 612 (4th Cir. 1999) (collecting cases).
Stansbury asserts that if the City is allowed to assert its untimeliness defense at this stage, more than four years after Stansbury's Charge of Discrimination was filed and two years after Stansbury filed his original complaint in this case, he would be the victim of "the most egregious sort of unfair surprise." (ECF No. 75 at 18.) He also suggests that he would be prejudiced by the late assertion of this defense because it denies him the "notice and time not only to frame legal arguments, but to establish relevant facts that might affect the applicability" of the defense. Id. Although Stansbury is probably overstating the extent of his feigned surprise—he was, after all, afforded the opportunity to respond to the defense in his Opposition—his argument [*6]  concerning the potential prejudice to him has merit.
The City's untimeliness defense is bound up in contested facts related to equitable tolling and estoppel. Stansbury presents colorable arguments that the time for him to file his Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC was equitably tolled, or that estoppel should operate to preclude the City from asserting this defense. But it is hardly clear that his arguments would prevail if considered on their merits. It is also not clear whether Stansbury, during discovery, focused his resources on uncovering relevant facts related to the timeliness of his Charge of Discrimination. The circumstances here are unlike those in Cornell v. Council of Unit Owners Hawaiian Vill. Condominiums, Inc., 983 F. Supp. 640, 643 (D. Md. 1997), which the City cites in its reply. There, the affirmative defense "involve[d] no factual issues." Id. Here, the issues turn on whether the City is estopped from asserting the defense, whether the EEOC's actions require equitable tolling, and whether Stansbury's untimely Charge of Discrimination relates back to the intake questionnaire he completed at the EEOC.
Because the City's untimeliness defense is intertwined with disputed factual issues that Stansbury had little reason to fully explore during discovery, I find that [*7]  allowing the defense at this stage would result in unfair prejudice to Stansbury. Accordingly, I find that the City has waived its untimeliness defense and that the defense is therefore not a basis to grant summary judgment.2 I find it unnecessary to reach the issues of whether equitable tolling or estoppel apply in this case.

B. Failure to Accommodate
The ADA prohibits employers from refusing to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). Reasonable accommodations may include "making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities," job restructuring, "acquisition or modification of equipment or devices," and other similar accommodations. Id. § 12111(9). The EEOC's regulations state that in making reasonable accommodations, an employer may be required to make "modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed" that enable a qualified disabled person to perform the essential functions of the job. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii).
"To establish [*8]  a prima facie case against his employer for failure to accommodate under the ADA, the plaintiff must show: (1) that he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of his disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the position . . .; and (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations." Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Although determination of the reasonableness of a proposed modification is often fact-specific, a court may grant summary judgment in favor of a defendant if the plaintiff fails to present evidence from which a jury may infer that the accommodation is reasonable on its face, i.e., ordinarily or in the run of cases, or if the defendant establishes as a matter of law that the proposed modification will cause undue hardship in the particular circumstances." Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 464 (4th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).
"Not all job requirements or functions are essential." Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 579. The EEOC's regulations provide a number of ways in which a job requirement might be deemed essential:
(i) The function may be essential because the reason the position exists is to perform that function; [*9] 
(ii) The function may be essential because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed; and/or
(iii) The function may be highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2).
To determine whether a job requirement is essential, courts may consider the following:
(i) The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential;
(ii) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job;
(iii) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function;
(iv) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function;
(v) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement;
(vi) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or
(vii) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3).
In addition, the ADA states that "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential [*10]  functions of the job." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
The City argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because Stansbury was unable to perform the essential functions of his position as an "Equipment Operator I," even with reasonable accommodation. (ECF No. 62-1 at 17-26.) The City states that Stansbury could not lift objects heavier than 30 pounds, which it argues is an essential function of the Equipment Operator I position. In support of this argument, the City catalogs evidence from a variety of sources. For example, the ADA section of the job description for the position of Equipment Operator I states: "Physical ability: strength and agility sufficient to lift and maneuver heavy objects such as heavy tools and equipment up to 100 lbs." (ECF No. 62-15.) Additionally, David Jarrell, the Director of DPW, stated during his deposition that the requirements contained in a DPW job description are "job requirements," which the DPW considers "as being necessary things that a person needs to be able to do to perform the job." (ECF No. 62-16 at 8.) Furthermore, Mr. Jarrell testified during his deposition that heavy lifting was required by employees in the Equipment Operator I position "at least occasionally, which [*11]  is probably a few times a week." (Id. at 15.) Marcia Patrick, the Assistant Director of DPW, testified that because of the variable nature of tasks assigned to Equipment Operator I employees, and because heavy lifting is regularly required, it is "really hard to perform" the job of Equipment Operator I without the ability to engage in heavy lifting. (ECF No. 62-17 at 6.) Stansbury's former supervisor, James Bell, testified in his deposition that employees classified as Equipment Operator I "did it all," helping with "anything that needed to be done." (ECF No. 62-21 at 5.) This might include picking up heavy objects from the shoulder of the road, lifting heavy tools, and handling bags of cold mix and salt, which each weighed between 40 and 100 pounds. (Id. at 9.) The City also submits evidence that employees in Stansbury's position were sometimes required to move furniture, assist with bulk pick up, and empty heavy trash cans. (See ECF No. 62-1 at 21.) Finally, the City points out that Stansbury himself admitted that he was "totally and permanently incapacitate[d] . . . from the further performance of [his] duties" as an Equipment Operator I. (ECF No. 62-11 at 14.)
Stansbury argues that [*12]  the issue of whether heavy lifting is an essential function of the Equipment Operator I position is a dispute of fact. (ECF No. 75 at 29-36.) He notes that while the job description for the position refers to heavy lifting, it does not state that it is an essential function. The closest the job description comes to defining the essential functions of the position is in its list of "distinguishing features," none of which refer to heavy lifting. Furthermore, Stansbury notes that the day-to-day realities of the position are such that heavy lifting is not required very often, and is not required of every employee. (Id. at 33.) Stansbury points out that when heavy lifting is required, the City's Safety Manual requires that "employees seek help from one another to lift objects they perceive[] to be too heavy to lift alone." (Id. at 34.) Because heavy lifting was not required frequently in the position, Stansbury recites a number of other tasks that he could perform, even with a lifting restriction. (Id. at 33-35.)
I find that a reasonable jury could decide that heavy lifting was not an essential function of the Equipment Operator I position and that with reasonable accommodation—such as [*13]  only assigning him tasks that did not include heavy lifting—Stansbury could perform all of the essential functions of his position. Accordingly, the City's Motion will be denied as to Stansbury's failure to accommodate claim.3

C. Retaliation
The ADA prohibits discrimination against any individual (whether disabled or not) who "has opposed any act or practice" forbidden by the statute, 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). See Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., 252 F.3d 696, 706 & n.3 (4th Cir. 2001) (ADA prohibits retaliatory discharge for engaging in protected activity, which includes requesting reasonable accommodation). In the absence of direct evidence of retaliation, a plaintiff must prove his claim under the pretext framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under this method of proof, a plaintiff "must show (1) that he engaged in protected activity; (2) that his employer took an adverse action against him; and (3) that a causal connection existed between the adverse [action] and the protected [activity]." Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., 252 F.3d 696, 706 (4th Cir. 2001). If the plaintiff satisfies this burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to "articulate a reasonable, nonretaliatory reason" for the adverse action. Id. at 705. If the defendant does so, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the proffered reason is a pretext for retaliation. Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 578 (4th Cir. 2015). "The plaintiff [*14]  always bears the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that [he] was the victim of retaliation." Id. (quoting Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 392 (4th Cir. 2001)).
Stansbury has submitted evidence that is sufficient to make out a prima facie case of retaliation. With regard to the first step, Stansbury engaged in protected activity. In March 2011, Stansbury notified the City that he "was cleared to return to light duty work" and requested that he "be allowed to return to work in a light duty capacity." (ECF Nos. 75-9 & 75-36 ¶ 36). In a letter dated May 31, 2011, Stansbury wrote to the City to complain about his transfer to the Residential Refuse Section. (ECF No. 75-15.) Stansbury also complained about his treatment by Robert Couchenour, the City Superintendent of Public Works, which Stansbury perceived as demeaning and discriminatory. (Id.) Requesting a reasonable accommodation from an employer and complaining of perceived discrimination are both protected activities under the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12203(b); Rhoads, 257 F.3d at 394; see also Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau Corp., 786 F.3d 264, 283 (4th Cir. 2015).
Moving on to the second step, there is sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the City took an adverse action against Stansbury. As Stansbury noted in his May 31, 2011 letter to the City, he was reassigned [*15]  from the Roadways Section to the Residential Refuse Section. In this position, Stansbury was assigned to "work alone at an area operated by the City . . . which is the site of the City's capped landfill" and is referred to as "the dump" by City employees. (ECF No. 75-36 ¶ 43.) Stansbury states that this work assignment was one of the dirtier and more unpleasant assignments for City employees. (Id. ¶¶ 45-52; see also ECF No. 75 at 26.) It was so unpleasant, he claims, that it made Stansbury the subject of ridicule among his colleagues. (ECF No. 75-36 ¶ 44.) Stansbury has presented evidence that is sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find "that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse," in that it would likely "deter victims of discrimination from complaining to the EEOC, the courts, and their employers." Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Supreme Court stated in Burlington, "[c]ommon sense suggests that one good way to discourage an employee . . . from bringing discrimination charges would be to insist that [he] spend more time performing the more arduous duties and less time performing those that are easier or more agreeable." Id. at 70-71. A jury could [*16]  reasonably conclude that Stansbury's reassignment to "the dump" would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee.4
At the third step, Stansbury relies on the temporal proximity of the City's adverse actions to his protected activities. (ECF No. 75 at 25, 27-28.) Under certain circumstances, "close temporal proximity [between a protected activity and an adverse action] is sufficient to establish a disputed issue of fact as to the causation element of the prima facie case." Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 579 (4th Cir. 2015); see also Foster v. Univ. of Md.-Eastern Shore, 787 F.3d 243, 247 (4th Cir. 2015) 247 (finding inference of causation where termination occurred within one month of employee filing complaint); King v. Rumsfeld, 328 F.3d 145, 151 & n. 5 (4th Cir. 2003) (finding that a two-and-a-half month gap between protected activity and an adverse employment action was sufficiently narrow to establish the causation prong of the prima facie case solely on the basis of temporal proximity). In this case, Stansbury's protected activities were in close proximity (less than two months) to his reassignment to "the dump." Because Stansbury has established a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the City to proffer a non-retaliatory reason for Stansbury's reassignment.
The City states that it temporarily assigned Stansbury to "the [*17]  dump" "due to the operational needs of DPW." (ECF No. 81 at 14.) The City articulates that "Plaintiff and another employee on medical leave were swapped with two employees who could physically perform the duties assigned in Roadways." (Id.) Stansbury argues that the City's real reasons for his reassignment were retaliatory. He notes the close temporal proximity between his March 2011 request for a "light duty" accommodation and his May 2011 reassignment to "the dump." He also notes that his May 31, 2011 complaint (ECF 75-15) to the human resources department about the retaliatory reassignment was quickly followed by a warning that the City might "take corrective or disciplinary action where the investigation does not reveal illegal discrimination or harassment, but does reveal that an employee has engaged in conduct which is disruptive or inconsistent with the City's policies or operation." (ECF No. 75-16.) I find that Stansbury's evidence of close temporal proximity between his protected activity and the City's adverse employment action is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that retaliation was the real reason for the City's actions. The City's motion for summary judgment [*18]  is denied as to Stansbury's retaliation claim.

III. Conclusion
Stansbury has presented sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the City failed to accommodate him and retaliated against him for engaging in protected activities. While Stansbury's evidence of discrimination and retaliation is by no means robust, it is not the function of this Court to weigh evidence or decide disputed facts when deciding a motion for summary judgment. Foster v. Univ. of Maryland-Eastern Shore, 787 F.3d 243, 248 (4th Cir. 2015). As other courts have noted, "proof of discrimination is often elusive." Lapsley v. Columbia Univ.-College of Physicians and Surgeons, 999 F. Supp. 506, 515-16 (S.D.N.Y. 1998). When an employer's intent is at issue, "direct, smoking gun, evidence of discrimination" is seldom available. Id.; see also D. Brock Hornby, Summary Judgment Without Illusions, 13 Green Bag 2d 273 (Spring 2010) (opining that "[j]udges should be slow to take inference questions away from juries," particularly in employment discrimination cases "where the critical issue — inference of discriminatory intent — is so fact-intensive"); Lapsley, 999 F. Supp. at 516 (noting that "[c]ourts must continue to be mindful that clever men may easily conceal their motivations.")
The City's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 62) is DENIED. My chambers will contact counsel to schedule a conference call to set a trial date and deadlines for pretrial submissions.
Despite the informal nature [*19]  of this letter, it is an Order of Court and shall be docketed accordingly.
Very truly yours,
