Opinion


CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings: Order (1) GRANTING IN PART and DENYING IN PART Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 27); and (2) VACATING April 5, 2021 Hearing (IN CHAMBERS)
Before the Court is Defendants' motion for summary judgment. ("Motion," Dkt. No. 27.) The Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution without a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. Upon consideration of the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Plaintiff's Motion and VACATES the April 5, 2021 hearing.

I. BACKGROUND
On August 14, 2019, Plaintiff Jessica Smith ("Plaintiff") filed a complaint for damages for disability discrimination in employment and related claims in the Superior [*2]  Court of the State of California for the County of Riverside against BBVA Compass Bancshares, Inc., BBVA Compass Bank, Compass Bank, and Does 1 to 25 (collectively, "Defendants"). ("Complaint," Dkt. No. 3-2.) On September 27, 2019, Defendants removed the action to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 3.)
The Complaint alleges six causes of action: (1) discrimination based on disability under the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (2) failure to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's disability; (3) failure to engage in an interactive process under FEHA; (4) retaliation under the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA") and FEHA; (5) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation under FEHA; and (6) constructive discharge in violation of public policy.

Plaintiff concurrently filed evidentiary objections. ("Plaintiff's Evidentiary Objections," Dkt. No. 30.) Plaintiff also filed a request for judicial notice. ("RJN," Dkt. No. 32.)
Defendants replied on November 30, 2020 ("Reply," Dkt. No. 34), and submitted a response to the PSGD ("Reply to PSGD," Dkt. No. 36), to PSUF ("Reply to PSUF," Dkt. No. 36, at 94), and their own evidentiary objections ("Defendants' Evidentiary Objections," Dkt. No. 35).

II. FACTS
The following material facts are sufficiently supported by admissible evidence and are uncontroverted, except as noted. They are "admitted to exist without controversy" for purposes of the Motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); L.R. 56-3. The Court considers [*5]  the parties' objections where necessary.1 All other objections are OVERRULED AS MOOT.
Plaintiff started working for BBVA Compass ("BBVA" or "Bank") on September 21, 2015 as a full-time Business Banking Officer II ("BBO"). (DSUF ¶ 1.) Plaintiff's starting salary was $ 95,000, and it did not decrease during her employment. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 5.) Upon her hiring, Plaintiff signed a letter explaining her compensation, including the Bank's Business Banking Officer Incentive Plan, which would provide an opportunity to earn an incentive for achieving a percentage of certain production goals. (PSUF ¶ 23.)
Plaintiff's essential job duties did not change during her employment at BBVA. (Smith Dep. Tr. 25:20-22; Smith Decl. ¶ 2.) However, the parties dispute what Plaintiff's essential job responsibilities were. (Reply to PSGD ¶¶ 3-4.) BBOs spend about 80% of their time on sales and 20% on client follow up, loan packaging, and portfolio calling. (DSUF ¶ 46.) The "Mission" in the BBO I/II job description includes: "Meet or exceed assigned sales goals related to small business lending, deposit and fee income products and services.... [A]cquiring and developing new and expanded client relationships [*6]  with small business customers." (BBO Job Description, Ex. 4.) The BBO job description does not state the sales goal amounts, as the goals change by year. (PSUF ¶ 39.) The goals were set unilaterally by the Bank, without any input or discussion with Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 56.) During Plaintiff's employment from 2015 to January 2018, incentive bonuses were dependent on achieving 80% of the quarterly goal in each assigned category. (PSUF ¶ 25.)
Plaintiff disputes that this "Mission" accurately reflects her essential job duties, and specifically disputes that meeting the assigned sales goals was an essential function.2 (PSGD ¶ 3). The parties dispute whether sales goals are "stretch goals," meaning that they are a "difficult goal to achieve in order to earn incentive compensation[,]" and a number of employees may not reach them. (Orrick Dep. Tr. 26:8-12. 28:1-10, Ex. X.) The parties also dispute how many BBOs do not meet their goals for the year. (Reply to PSUF ¶ 35.)

A. Plaintiff's Health and Medical Leaves
Plaintiff had a history of respiratory issues, for which she consulted with medical providers prior to February 2017, and during her employment with Defendants. (PSUF ¶ 43.) In mid-2017, Plaintiff's [*7]  physicians discovered a mass in her chest, with a possibility that the mass could be cancerous. (Id. ¶ 44.)

1. First Medical Leave: August to September 2017
Plaintiff informed Defendants of her medical condition, (PSUF ¶45), and went on an approved leave from August 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017. (DSUF ¶ 10.) In her leave of absence application form, she indicated that she was having pain and shortness of breath and that she had a lung mass. (PSUF ¶ 45.)
On August 29, 2017, Plaintiff provided a Return to Work Certification by fax releasing her to work with the following restrictions: has multiple doctor appointments, needs frequent breaks, and no lifting. (DSUF ¶ 12.) Plaintiff was able to visit her doctors as needed, generally before or after work. (DSUF ¶ 13; Smith Decl. ¶ 40.) She was also able to take breaks as needed (DSUF ¶ 14), although she was expected to make up for that time (Smith Decl. ¶ 51). Plaintiff received help lifting a box of items to give out to consumers ("swag") when needed (DSUF ¶¶ 15-16), although the parties dispute whether she mentioned not being able to lift the box to her manager Kat Priem. (Smith Decl. ¶ 17; Smith Dep. Tr. 65:5-9; Priem Decl. ¶ 13.)

2. Second [*8]  Medical Leave: December 2017 to January 2018
During the second half of 2017, Defendants accommodated Plaintiff with leave, providing her assistance with her FMLA paperwork and giving her extra time to complete certain tasks. (PSUF ¶ 46.) On November 1, 2017, Plaintiff informed Human Resources/Team Member Specialist Jennifer Polnett that she was very helpful with her previous leave, and asked to speak with her about a leave in December 2017. (DSUF ¶ 18.)
Plaintiff submitted a leave of absence application form in November 2017, noting that she was still having pain and shortness of breath related to her lung mass. (PSUF ¶ 47.) Plaintiff went on a second approved leave from December 4, 2017 to January 8, 2018. (DSUF ¶ 19.) During this time, she attended multiple appointments further investigating her medical situation. (PSUF ¶ 48.)
Plaintiff provided a Return to Work Certification by fax on January 5, 2018, releasing her to return to work with the following restrictions: multiple doctor appointments and no lifting. (DSUF ¶ 20; PSUF ¶ 50.)
On January 18, 2018, Plaintiff reported that she was "back and healthy." (DSUF ¶ 22.)

3. Return from Third Medical Leave in January 2018
After her return [*9]  to work, in January 2018, Plaintiff received Defendants' 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan. (PSUF ¶ 55.) As a BBO II, Plaintiff's annual sales goals for 2018-2019 included achieving $ 4.5 million in funded loan production and lending, $ 4.5 million in deposits, and $ 35,000 in fee income. (Priem Decl. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff attests that this was a four-fold increase from the first quarter goals in 2017. (Smith Decl. ¶¶ 18, 41.)
When Plaintiff returned to work, Priem had also instituted a new procedure requiring submission of weekly check-in forms prior to weekly one-on-one meetings. (PSUF ¶ 57.) On her January 10, 2018 check-in form, Plaintiff noted that her top prospects were "not on saleforce" and questioned "where did they go?" (Jan. 10, 2018 Check-In Form; Ex. G.) On her January 24, 2018 check-in form, Plaintiff noted "Kat [Priem] mentioned no face to faces until Feb. 12th" and "(Traveling)." (Jan. 24, 2018 Check-In Form, Ex. H.) While Plaintiff asserts that she was informed that she was not allowed to do face-to-face meetings with any potential clients until mid-February, hindering her ability to perform her duties (Smith Decl. ¶ 21), Defendants dispute that assertion, holding that the [*10]  document only shows that Priem was not able to accompany Plaintiff on the face-to-face meeting with the Association until February 12, 2018 because Priem was traveling (Reply to PSUF ¶ 61).
On January 10 and 24, 2018, Priem conducted a one-on-one meeting with Plaintiff to discuss her sales, activities, and any coaching/training she would like. (DSUF ¶¶ 25-26.) During another one-on-one meeting on March 7, 2018, Priem noted that Plaintiff had secured $ 0.00 in loan production, $ 0.00 in deposits, and $ 0.00 in fee income, informed her that she was ranked last among the BBOs, and discussed ways to get her back on track. (Priem Decl. ¶ 16; Mar. 7, 2018 check-in form, Ex. 16.) Plaintiff disputes that assessment, and asserts she had $ 500,000 in approved loans in the pipeline. (PSGD ¶ 27; Smith Decl. ¶ 25.)
In March 2018, Priem told Plaintiff that she should go on face-to-face appointments twice a day before coming into the office. (Smith Decl. ¶ 22; Mar. 7, 2018 check-in form, Ex. I.)
On March 16, 2018, Priem issued written warnings to two other BBOs on her team for failing to meet their sales performance expectations, and provided them with an action plan. (DSUF ¶ 29.)
On March 19, 2018, [*11]  Priem suggested that Plaintiff should start providing a daily report of "who you are contacting, the opportunity and information about the business" to "review these opportunities together with the aim of getting better results from your calling efforts." (March 19, 2018 e-mail, Ex. 16.) Priem added that "[t]his strategy is working with other BBO's[.]" (Id.) In response, Plaintiff thanked Priem for her guidance and asserted, "I look forward to seeing better sale results in my performance soon." (Id.; DSUF ¶ 32.) Priem continued to conduct one-on-one meetings with Plaintiff to discuss her performance. (DSUF ¶ 34.)
The parties dispute Plaintiff's progress in her performance goals for the first quarter of 2018. Defendants assert that Plaintiff had $ 0.00 in loan production, $ 0.00 in deposits, and $ 0.00 in fee income. (Priem Decl. ¶ 20; Scorecard, Ex. 17.) Plaintiff counters that she met her fee income goals for January and February 2018 and had $ 500,000 in approved loans in the pipeline. (Smith Decl. ¶ 25.) While BBOs were responsible for reviewing and reporting any discrepancies in their previous quarterly production activity within 45 days after the respective quarter end, (DSUF ¶ [*12]  59), the parties dispute whether Plaintiff informed Priem that her 2018 Scorecard did not accurately represent her numbers (PSGD ¶ 60).

B. Written Warning on Performance
On May 15, 2018, Priem issued Plaintiff a written warning noting "your performance has not met expectations[,]" and including a plan to "work together to increase your performance by modifying behaviors consistent with the Bank's sales management program." ("May 2018 warning," Ex. 18.) The action plan included "Minimum Standards for Sales Production and desired actions to meet these standards." (Signed action plan, Ex. 19.) The action plan included the following employee remarks:
"2017 under 70% no disciplinary action was given 2018 on a yearly performance goal I was give [sic] a written warning with no verbal warning leading to disciplinary action. Management is looking for results in activity that can extend this warning or 70% in one category will also show improvement. What was discuss [sic] with HR is my doctors [sic] restrictions on my medical condition have no accomdiations [sic] to my performance sale goal. I was told activities are being done stated not fast enough."
(Id.) The parties dispute whether Plaintiff [*13]  was disciplined or given any warning that she was underperforming prior to the May 2018 written warning. (Smith Decl. ¶¶ 8-9; Priem Decl. ¶¶ 16, 18-19.) Plaintiff attests that prior to May 2018, she "received no negative evaluations, verbal warnings, or any other discipline," but rather Priem often told her that she was doing well and that she appreciated her work. (Smith Decl. ¶ 9.) Priem attests that she verbally counseled Plaintiff regarding her performance in March/April 2018. (Priem Decl. ¶¶ 16, 18-19.) Plaintiff's March and April check-in forms noted that she was ranked 135 (last) among BBOs. (March-April check-in forms, Ex. 16; Priem Decl. ¶¶ 16, 18-20.)
Even though Plaintiff had not reached any of her incentive goals in prior years, she was not given any negative feedback on her performance. (Smith Decl. ¶ 8.) In May of 2017, Plaintiff received an incentive bonus for achieving 80% of one incentive goal in the Business Checking category. (Id. ¶ 26.) Although Plaintiff scored only 47% in the Business Loan Organization category and 50% in the Strategic Partner Income goal in May of 2017, she did not receive any negative feedback on her performance. (PSUF ¶ 28.) While in the fourth [*14]  quarter of 2017, Plaintiff scored only 44% in the Business Checking-Personal category, 14% in the Business Loan Origination category, and 56% in the Fee Income category of her incentive sales goals, she was not given any negative feedback on her performance. (Id. ¶ 29.) Similarly, while Plaintiff scored 65%, 36%, and 51% in these categories in 2016, she was not given any negative feedback on her performance. (Id. ¶ 30.) Plaintiff attests that from when she started in 2015 through 2017, even though she never met 100% of her incentive goals, on Bank-prepared performance summaries, she was typically shown to be in the middle range for her performance goals out of the approximately 130 BBOs nationwide. (Smith Decl. ¶ 27.)

C. Request for Accommodations
On May 29, 2018, Plaintiff spoke to Tammy Fincher, her "talent partner," to discuss the written warning she had received and her need to obtain accommodations due to her limitations, as stated by her physicians.3 (PSUF ¶ 95.) On May 31, 2018, Plaintiff was advised by Jennifer Polnett that she had two weeks remaining for FMLA and that if she were to take a leave of absence for a new condition, she would receive short-term disability at 100% for [*15]  a longer period. (DSUF ¶ 37.)
On June 1, 2018, Plaintiff e-mailed Fincher and Polnett the revised certificate and stated that she had previously faxed said documents, as well as given copies to Priem. (Id. ¶ 96.) She noted that her doctor "revised it once he found out my tumor came back in February." (Revised Return to Work Certification, Ex. 21.) The form includes the following accommodations: "Has follow up appointments" and "Reduce workload/ minimize stress." (Id.) It lists an estimated duration of "June 15th 2018." (Id.) The parties disagree as to when Plaintiff first provided this revised form, (PSGD ¶¶ 38-40), and when it was revised by Plaintiff's doctors (id. ¶ 51.)
Plaintiff also provided a note from her pulmonologist, Dr. Munif Salek, where he stated that she has a lung disease and cannot stand for long periods of time. (Smith Decl. ¶ 23; Return to Work Certification, Ex. 21.) The parties dispute when Plaintiff provided this note: Plaintiff attests that she sent it in April of 2018 (Smith Decl. ¶ 23), and Defendants assert that they received it on June 1, 2018, along with the revised return to work certification (Polnett Decl. ¶ 8; Fincher Decl. ¶ 6; June 1, 2018 e-mail and [*16]  attachments, Ex. 21).
Fincher told Plaintiff that she should obtain a Bank-prepared questionnaire from her physician so that Defendants could determine if her restrictions could be accommodated. (PSUF ¶ 97.) Plaintiff's physician, Alwin Bagingito, filled out the questionnaire, stating that Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her position with the following accommodations: "Patient sometimes cannot work at fast pace. Patient may experience respiratory limitations. May have difficulty performing activities that require excessive physical activity." (Medical Director or Physician Questionnaire, Ex. M.) The questionnaire further notes: "If patient overdoes pace of work or multiple activities, chest wall pain sets her back. This will cause fatigue/weakness." (Id.) It adds that accommodations that should be considered or explored are: "She may need reduced or modify [sic] workload. Major life activity, physical impairment that substantial [sic] limits respiratory function." (Id.)
On June 11, 2018, Plaintiff provided the completed questionnaire to Fincher by e-mail, stating "if you need anything else, please let me know. My doctor will provide any additional explanations and [*17]  restrictions to help accommodate my disability." (Ex. M.) Fincher responded that she would review with the Bank's "line of business to understand if they can accommodate this request." (PSUF ¶ 102.) Plaintiff was never told that the questionnaire documents she submitted were in any way deficient. (Id. ¶ 103.) On June 12, 2018, Fincher told Plaintiff that she had what she needed to find out about accommodating Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 106.)

1. Denial of Request
Plaintiff asked Fincher if her "goals" could be adjusted in any way, and if she could reduce her calling activity and the number of locations/clients to visit. (Smith Decl. ¶¶ 27, 33; Fincher Decl. ¶ 17.) Plaintiff and Fincher did not discuss any specifics about any kind of quantification or percentage of adjustment. (PSUF ¶ 108.)
Fincher only discussed Plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodation with Priem. (Fincher Dep. Tr. 37:5-10.) However, Plaintiff's request was denied after conversations with California CEO Everett Orrick, Small and Medium Enterprises Network Executive Elizabeth Dobers, and Priem. (Priem Dep. Tr. 58:21-23; Orrick Dep. Tr. 25:17-20; Dobers Dep. Tr. 36:16-18.) Orrick never looked at any policies Defendants had [*18]  in relation to accommodating disabilities in relation to Plaintiff. (PSUF ¶ 112.) Dobers was not aware that Plaintiff's request for accommodation was related to a disability. (Id. ¶ 113.)
Fincher informed Plaintiff that Defendants denied her request for accommodation in its entirety, stating that meeting the incentive sales goals was an essential function of the job. (Id.; Fincher Dep. Tr. 43:9-20.) Fincher added that if Plaintiff continued in the BBO position, she would have to meet the expectations of the position. (PSUF ¶ 115; Fincher Decl. ¶ 7 ("I informed [Smith] that her sales goals/performance standards could not be reduced.").) Plaintiff complained to Fincher that she thought she was being punished for having a disability. (Smith Decl. ¶ 34.) Fincher told Plaintiff she could look for and apply to other positions. (PSUF ¶ 124.)
On or about June 12, 2018, Priem told Plaintiff that she was performing well and that they would meet again in two weeks. (PSGD ¶ 104.)

2. Search for Other Positions
From June 2018 to the end of Plaintiff's employment, there were no other available BBO positions at Plaintiff's level near her residence in Murrieta, California. (DSUF ¶ 76.) Plaintiff searched [*19]  for other positions at BBVA within driving distance of her home, and identified three positions of interest: (1) Treasury Management Relationship Partner; (2) Deposit Relationship Manager; and (3) Branch Manager. (DSUF ¶ 66.) While Defendants assert that the available positions were either graded higher than Plaintiff's position (and would therefore be considered a promotion), outside of Plaintiff's geographical area of interest, beyond her qualifications, or offered to better-ranked employees, Plaintiff disputes some of Defendants' characterizations about her qualifications, and/or asserts that she only learned about the positions after they had been filled. (PSGD ¶¶ 67-69, 72.)
The parties also dispute whether Priem or anyone from Human Resources contacted Plaintiff about her need for an accommodation. (Reply to PSGD ¶ 54; Smith Decl. ¶ 17; Priem Decl. ¶¶ 5, 10, 13, 25, 30-31; Fincher Decl. ¶¶ 5-12; Polnett Decl. ¶¶ 5, 6-11.)

3. DFEH Complaint
On or about August 16, 2018, Plaintiff contacted the Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") and complained that Defendants would not accommodate her, had not engaged in any type of interactive process, and that she was being discriminated [*20]  and retaliated against for having a disability and making complaints. (PSUF ¶ 131.) In September 2018, Plaintiff filed a formal complaint with the DFEH. (Id. ¶ 132.) Defendants received the complaint on September 12, 2018. (Id. ¶ 133.) No one from BBVA contacted Plaintiff directly about her DFEH complaint. (Smith Decl. ¶ 36.)
Plaintiff requested transfer to another open position, and provided the DFEH investigator and Defendants with a few positions of interest. (Smith Decl. ¶ 42.) The DFEH investigator informed Plaintiff that the Bank stated all the positions were filled. (PSUF ¶ 157.)

D. Return from Fourth Medical Leave in December 2018
Plaintiff went on an approved leave from July 20, 2018 to December 17, 2018. (DSUF ¶ 49.) On December 13, 2018, Plaintiff saw Dr. Bagingito to obtain a note returning her to work on December 18, 2018. (PSUF ¶ 135.) Dr. Bagingito's office sent BBVA a return to work certification for Plaintiff's prior leave from December 2017. (Fax from Dr. Bagingito's office, Ex. 23.) On December 14, 2018, Plaintiff sent BBVA a return to work certification for Plaintiff's July to December 2018 leave. (December 13, 2018 Return to Work Certification, Ex. 24.)
On December [*21]  21, 2018, Tammy Fincher met with Plaintiff to discuss her Return to Work Certification. (Id. ¶ 54.) Later that day, Plaintiff e-mailed Fincher an Aspire Recognition eCard stating: "Thank you for being understanding and fair. I appreciate all that you have done during my medical leave and my process during my return back to work." (Dec. 21, 2018 e-mails, Ex. 27.) Plaintiff disputes that this e-mail had anything to do with her request for accommodation. (Reply to DSUF ¶ 55.)
In December 2018, Priem directed Plaintiff to focus on completing her compliance training for the rest of the year. (Priem Decl. ¶ 25; Dec. 17, 2018 E-mails, Exs. 25-26.) Later, Priem required that Plaintiff send her reports every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday by the end of the day explaining her day's activities. (Smith Decl. ¶ 38; Ex. T.) Plaintiff's calls with Priem throughout 2019 were very positive and never negative. (DSUF ¶ 58.)
Starting in December 2018, Plaintiff was unable to access Salesforce, a program used by BBOs, due to a log-in problem. (PSUF ¶ 138.) Plaintiff made several complaints but was unable to gain access for approximately a month. (Smith Decl. ¶ 37; Complaints re Salesforce access, Ex. Q.) [*22]  Up until January 2019, Plaintiff was unable to access her leads and information for potential clients. (Smith Decl. ¶ 39.) Plaintiff's issues accessing Salesforce were resolved by January 18, 2019. (DSUF ¶ 56.)

E. Final Medical Leaves and Exit from Company
On March 12, 2019, Plaintiff accepted employment from Banner Bank. (DSUF ¶ 63.) On March 26, 2019, Plaintiff's request to take off from work from March 26 to April 8, 2019 due to "chest pain" was approved. (Id. ¶ 61.) On April 1, 2019, Plaintiff started working for Banner Bank. (Id. ¶ 64.) She obtained a full-time position as a Vice-President and Business Banker, essentially performing the same kind of duties she performed for Defendants. (PSGD ¶ 170.)
On April 8, 2019, Plaintiff's request to take off from work until April 11, 2019 due to "chest pain" was approved. (DSUF ¶ 62.) Plaintiff never returned to work for Defendants. (PSUF ¶ 167.) No one was hired to replace Plaintiff in her market, and her portfolio was taken over by two of her BBO colleagues. (Id. ¶ 169.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. [*23]  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden of informing the district court of the basis for its motion and identifying the portions of the pleadings and record that it believes demonstrate the absence of an issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Where the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need not produce evidence negating or disproving every essential element of the non-moving party's case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Instead, the moving party need only prove there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Id.; In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010). The party seeking summary judgment must show that "under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
If the moving party has sustained its burden, the non-moving party must then show that there is a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. A genuine issue of material fact exists "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. "This burden is not a light one. The non-moving party must show more than the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d at 387 (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252). The non-moving party must make this showing on all matters placed at issue by the [*24]  motion as to which it has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
When deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir. 1991). Thus, summary judgment for the moving party is proper when a "rational trier of fact" would not be able to find for the non-moving party based on the record taken as a whole. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Discrimination on the Basis of Disability under FEHA (First Cause of Action)
Plaintiff asserts a claim for discrimination based on her physical disability. (Compl. ¶¶ 7-22.) FEHA outlaws employment discrimination on the basis of physical disability. Cal. Govt. Code § 12945(a).
"California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination . . . ." Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). This framework applies to wrongful termination claims based on disability discrimination. See generally id.; Sandell v. Taylor—Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297 (2010); Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125 (2003). Under this framework:
A plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its employment decision. Then, in order to prevail, the plaintiff [*25]  must demonstrate that the employer's alleged reason for the adverse employment decision is a pretext for another motive which is discriminatory.
Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994) (citation omitted); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 68-69, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000).
Here, however, "the burden is reversed . . . because the defendant who seeks summary judgment bears the initial burden" in an employment discrimination action. Dep't of Fair Employment & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011) (interpreting FEHA) (quotations and citations omitted); Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 224, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). In other words, the defendant bears the initial burden to "show either that (1) plaintiff [can]not establish one of the elements of the FEHA claim or (2) there [is] a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions." Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d at 745 (citations and quotations omitted).
With regard to the first means of discharging a defendant's burden, disparate treatment claims require evidence of intentional discrimination, which often leads to an "elusive" factual inquiry. As a result, "the plaintiff need produce very little evidence of discriminatory motive to raise a genuine issue of fact." Mustafa v. Clark Cty. Sch. Dist., 157 F.3d 1169, 1180 (9th Cir. 1998).
With regard to a defendant's second means of discharging its burden, "legitimate reasons are reasons that are facially unrelated to prohibited bias, and which, if true, would thus preclude a finding of discrimination." Reeves v. MV Transp., Inc., 186 Cal. App. 4th 666, 673, 111 Cal. Rptr. 3d 896 (2010) (quotations omitted [*26]  and emphasis in original). Assuming a defendant's initial burden is met because of the existence of a legitimate reason, "the employee must then 'offer substantial evidence that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual, or evidence the employer acted with a discriminatory animus, or a combination of the two, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer engaged in intentional discrimination.'" Id. (quoting Hersant v. Department of Social Services, 57 Cal. App. 4th 997, 1004-05, 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d 483 (1997)).

1. Prima Facie Case
To make a prima facie showing of sex discrimination, Plaintiff must:
provide evidence that (1) [s]he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive.
Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 355, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000).
Here, the parties dispute the second, third, and fourth elements of a prima facie case: (2) whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodations; (3) whether she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) whether it was [*27]  because of her disability.4 (Mot. at 6-7.)

a. Qualifications
Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff meets the qualification standards for a BBO II, a position she held for two years prior to her disability. Whether Plaintiff was "qualified" for the position, therefore, turns on whether she could perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
The parties dispute the essential job functions of BBOs. Essential functions are "fundamental job duties of the employment position ... not including the marginal functions of the position." See Bates, 511 F.3d at 988 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1)). As Plaintiff asserts, identifying essential job functions is a "highly fact-specific inquiry." Lui v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 211 Cal. App. 4th 962, 971, 150 Cal. Rptr. 3d 385 (2012). Courts consider evidence of the employer's judgment as to which functions are essential; written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job; the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; the work experience of past incumbents on the job; and the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs. Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(2). And where there is "conflict in the evidence regarding the essential functions of [a position], [the Ninth Circuit has] conclude[d] that there is [*28]  a factual dispute ..., notwithstanding the job descriptions that [an employer] has prepared." Rohr v. Salt River Project Agric. Imp. & Power Dist., 555 F.3d 850, 864 (9th Cir. 2009).
Plaintiff raises a genuine issue of fact on whether she could perform the "essential functions" of her position with accommodation. It is undisputed that BBOs spend about 80% of their time on sales and 20% on client follow up, loan packaging, and portfolio calling. (DSUF ¶ 46.) It is also undisputed that the Bank sets quarterly sales goals for BBOs in different categories. (DSUF ¶ 23; PSUF ¶ 25.) But there is conflicting evidence on whether meeting or exceeding the assigned sales goals constitutes an essential function. The "Mission" in the BBO I/II job description includes: "Meet or exceed assigned sales goals related to small business lending, deposit and fee income products and services.... [A]cquiring and developing new and expanded client relationships with small business customers." (BBO Job Description, Ex. 4.) Defendants argue that courts consider the employer's judgment as to what functions are essential. (Reply at 2.) While that may be so, that evidence is not conclusive, as "an employer may not turn every condition of employment which it elects to adopt into a job function, let [*29]  alone an essential job function, merely by including it in a job description." Rohr, 555 F.3d at 864 (citing Cripe v. City of San Jose, 261 F.3d 877, 887 (9th Cir. 2001)). That Defendants include "meet[ing] or exceed[ing]" sales goals in the BBO job description is not enough to establish that they are an essential function of the job. Id.
To counter Defendants' argument, Plaintiff points to testimony from the Bank's California CEO, stating that these sales goals are "stretch goals," meaning that they are a "difficult goal to achieve in order to earn incentive compensation." (Orrick Dep. Tr. 26:8-12, 28:1-10.) Plaintiff also points to testimony from Orrick, Elizabeth Dobers, and District Retail Executive Lynne Steel that 65 to 70 percent of BBOs do not meet their goals. (Dobers Dep. Tr. 46:15-47:10; Steele Dep. Tr. 23:9-14; Orrick Dep. Tr. 27:19-20.) Moreover, it is undisputed that as part of the Bank's Bonus Incentive Plan, incentive bonuses were dependent on achieving only 80% of the quarterly goal in each assigned category. (PSUF ¶ 25.) Plaintiff herself obtained a bonus after meeting 80% of the quarterly goal. (Id. ¶ 26.)
Thus, while conducting sales may be an essential function, Defendants fail to establish that "meeting or exceeding" the sales goals at issue [*30]  are essential to Plaintiff's position. Bates v. United Parcel Svc., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 992 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting that "an employer who disputes the plaintiff's claim that he can perform the essential functions must put forth evidence establishing those functions"). A reasonable jury could find that these are instead aspirational goals to incentivize production, for example.
There is similarly a triable issue as to whether reducing said goals (or adjusting the expectation that Plaintiff meet or exceed them) is a reasonable accommodation. Defendants argue that Plaintiff's accommodation request would "eliminate not just essential job duties but really the reason the position exists." (Mot. at 7.) The Court is not persuaded. Plaintiff requested to reduce her sales goals, calling activity, and the number locations to travel to (Smith Decl. ¶ 27, 33; Fincher Decl. ¶ 17), but it is undisputed that Plaintiff did not discuss any specifics about any kind of quantification or percentage (PSUF ¶ 108). Yet, Defendants denied Plaintiff's requests, and informed Plaintiff that "her sales goals/performance standards could not be reduced." (PSUF ¶ 115; Fincher Decl. ¶ 7; Fincher Dep. Tr. 43:9-20.) Given that there is a triable issue as to whether meeting or exceeding [*31]  her sales goals was an essential function of her role, there is similarly a triable issue as to whether reducing said goals is a reasonable request.
Defendants set forth various authorities for the proposition that employees with a disability must meet the same production standards as other employees, and lowering or changing production standards because an employee cannot meet then due to disability is not considered a reasonable accommodation. (Mot. at 8 (listing cases).) But this assumes that meeting said production standards (here, sales goals) is in fact an essential function of Plaintiff's job, which Defendants fail to establish. Construing the evidence in favor of Plaintiff, as the Court must do at this stage, there is a genuine dispute of fact as to whether Plaintiff was qualified for her position.

b. Adverse Employment Action
Defendants next argue that Plaintiff cannot establish an adverse employment action. (Mot. at 9.) An "adverse employment action" in the FEHA context must "materially affect[ ] the terms and conditions of employment" and it "encompasses not only ultimate employment decisions, 'but also the entire spectrum of employment actions that are reasonably likely to [*32]  adversely and materially affect an employee's job performance or opportunity for advancement in his or her career.'" Patten v. Grant Joint Union High Sch. Dist., 134 Cal. App. 4th 1378, 1387, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 113 (2005) (citations omitted).
Defendants argue that a warning letter is not an adverse employment action, and add that Plaintiff fails to meet the high burden to establish constructive discharge. (Mot. at 9-10.) Plaintiff argues that the adverse action asserted is not merely the warning letter, but rather, that Defendants suddenly required Plaintiff to meet 100% of a substantially larger incentive goal, which had not been required of her (or other BBOs) prior to her taking protected leave and requesting reasonable accommodation. (Opp'n at 14.) Plaintiff contends that this was a material change to the terms and conditions of her employment. (Id. at 14-16.)
The Court finds that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether Defendants' increased sales goals and requirement that Plaintiff meet or exceed these goals was an adverse employment action. As a BBO II, Plaintiff's annual sales goals for 2018-2019 included achieving $ 4.5 million in funded loan production and lending, $ 4.5 million in deposits, and $ 35,000 in fee income. (Priem Decl. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff attests, and Defendants [*33]  do not seem to dispute, that this was a significant (almost four-fold) increase from Plaintiff's first quarter goals in 2017. (Smith Decl. ¶ 18; Reply to PSGD ¶ 23.) The parties dispute whether the sales goals were "stretch goals." (Orrick Dep. Tr. 26:8-12, 28:1-10.) More importantly, as established above, Plaintiff disputes that she (or other BBOs) were previously required to meet or exceed these goals. Plaintiff had not met (much less exceeded) the sales goals in prior years, and did not receive any written warnings as a result. (PSUF ¶¶ 28-30 (noting that Plaintiff only scored between 14% and 56% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and between 36% and 65% in 2016).) It is also undisputed that meeting 80% of the quarterly goal in each assigned category made BBOs eligible for incentive bonuses, (PSUF ¶ 25), and that Plaintiff herself obtained a bonus after meeting 80% of the quarterly goal in 2017 (id. ¶ 26). A reasonable jury could therefore find that Defendants materially altered Plaintiff's conditions of employment by imposing new requirements on Plaintiff.

c. Discriminatory Motive
Finally, Defendants contend that there is no evidence that Plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment [*34]  action because of her disability. (Mot. at 10.) Defendants assert that just because they were aware of Plaintiff's health issues, that is not sufficient to establish that they knew about Plaintiff's purported disability. (Mot. at 10-11; Reply at 6.)
The Court emphasizes that an "employee need only offer sufficient circumstantial evidence to give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination." McInteer v. Ashley Distribution Servs., Ltd., 40 F. Supp. 3d 1269, 1281 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (citation omitted).
Plaintiff provides ample evidence to support BBVA's knowledge about Plaintiff's disability. After returning from her second leave in January 2018, Plaintiff reported that she was "back and healthy" (DSUF ¶ 22) and presented a Return to Work Certification with limited restrictions unrelated to her lung mass (DSUF ¶ 20; PSUF ¶ 50). However, Plaintiff later presented a revised certification indicating that Plaintiff had "respiratory distress" and that she needed accommodation to "reduce work load / minimize stress" until June 2018. (See June 1, 2018 E-mail and revised form, Ex. 21.) In June 2018, Plaintiff also subsequently provided additional medical questionnaires and records putting Defendants on notice about her purported disability. (See, e.g., Medical Director or Physician [*35]  Questionnaire, Ex. M.)
The parties dispute when BBVA first received the revised form and other relevant records from Plaintiff or her physicians. (Reply to PSGD ¶ 40.) Defendants assert they only received this information in June 2018, after the May 2018 written warning to Plaintiff. (Id.) However, as established above, the alleged adverse action at issue is not limited to the written warning. Plaintiff asserts that shortly after her return from leave in January 2018, she received a Bonus Incentive Plan with significantly increased goals, her supervisor started requiring weekly check-in forms, she received a written warning and criticism about her performance for the first time, and Defendants began requiring that she meet or exceed her sales goals. (Opp'n at 15-16.)
The Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's medical leaves and accommodation requests, and purported material changes to her performance requirements. At this stage, construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the evidence on the circumstances surrounding her return from her second leave in January 2018, subsequent performance requirements, and denial [*36]  of requested accommodation is sufficient to raise the possibility of a prima facie case that Plaintiff was subjected to adverse employment action because of her disability.

2. Legitimate Non-Discriminatory Reasons
Once a FEHA plaintiff demonstrates a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. The defendant must make a "sufficient showing of a legitimate reason for discharge." King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 433, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359, (2007). The defendant's "burden is one of production, not persuasion, thereby involving no credibility assessment." See Day v. Sears Holdings Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1169 (C.D. Cal. 2013).
Defendants assert that Plaintiff received a written warning because her sales were "virtually non-existent." (Mot. at 12.) She had zero sales across the board during the first quarter of 2018: $ 0.00 in loan production (compared to the first quarter goal of $ 1,125,000), $ 0.00 in deposits (with a goal of $ 1,125,000), and $ 0.00 in fee income (with a goal of $ 8,750). (Priem Decl. ¶ 20; Scorecard (first quarter 2018), Ex. 17.) Plaintiff disputes this assessment, instead holding that she had met her fee income goals for January-February 2018, and had $ 500,000 of approved loans in the pipeline. (Smith Decl. ¶ [*37]  25; May 15, 2018 warning letter, Ex. K.)
But even assuming that Defendants proffer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for adverse action, Plaintiff sufficiently establishes a triable issue as to whether that reason is pretextual. California courts have taken different approaches to what level or "quality" of evidence is necessary at the third step of the McDonnell Douglas framework. Some have indicated that "[s]ubstantial evidence" is required. DeJung, 169 Cal.App.4th at 553; Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1735, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181 (1994). Others have called for much less, i.e., "very little evidence." See Nadaf—Rahrov, 166 Cal.App.4th at 992 ("Because proof of discriminatory intent often depends on inferences rather than on direct evidence, very little evidence of such intent is necessary to defeat summary judgment."); cf. Horsford, 132 Cal.App.4th at 377 ("Neither Guz nor any other case cited by the Trustees stands for the proposition that any particular form or quality of evidence is required for a plaintiff to establish intentional discrimination."). The Ninth Circuit has generally taken the former approach, requiring that at least circumstantial evidence of pretext be "specific" and "substantial" to create a genuine issue of material fact. See Coghlan, 413 F.3d 1090, 1095 (9th Cir. 2005) ("[W]hen the plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence, that evidence must be 'specific [*38]  and substantial' to defeat the employer's motion for summary judgment."); Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1222; see also Cornwell, 439 F.3d at 1029; Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal.App.4th 52, 69, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000) (adopting Ninth Circuit's approach in FEHA case). Ultimately, "summary judgment for the employer may...be appropriate where, given the strength of the employer's showing of innocent reasons, any countervailing circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motive, even if it may technically constitute a prima facie case, is too weak to raise a rational inference that discrimination occurred." Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 362; see also Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148. That is not the case here.
Plaintiff meets both the "very little evidence" standard in Nadaf-Rahrov, and the higher "substantial evidence" standard in DeJung. In addition to making a prima facie case, Plaintiff presents evidence that calls into question the veracity of the reasons identified for the adverse action at issue. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148 (2000) ("[A] Plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated."). While Defendants assert that hitting the incentive sales goals is an essential function of her job, Plaintiff presents evidence that they did not replace her after [*39]  her alleged constructive termination (PSUF ¶ 169); she (and other BBOs) were not required to perform at 100% of the goals prior to the Bank's claims following her medical leave and requested accommodation (id. ¶¶ 27, 28-30); and while Plaintiff never met 100% of her sales goals in prior years, rather than receiving any written warnings, she in fact received incentive pay for one goal in 2017 (id.). Plaintiff also disputes that her sales were "virtually non-existent," presenting evidence that she had met her fee income goals for January-February 2018, and had $ 500,000 approved in loans in the pipeline. (Smith Decl. ¶ 25; May 15, 2018 warning letter, Ex. K.) The Court concludes that, based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could find Defendants' reason to be pretextual, and reject it as an insufficient justification.
As a result, the Court DENIES Defendants' Motion as to the first cause of action.

B. Failure to Accommodate Disability (Second Cause of Action) and Failure to Engage in Interactive Process (Third Cause of Action)
Plaintiff contends that Defendants failed to make reasonable accommodations for Plaintiff and failed to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA. [*40]  Section 12940(m) provides that it is unlawful "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee." The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability. Scotch v. Art Institute of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009).
Under FEHA, it is also unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for accommodation by an employee . . . ." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). To state a prima facie case for failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process, a plaintiff must also demonstrate that she "tender[ed] a specific request for a necessary accommodation." King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 443, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007) (quoting Spitzer v. Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1384, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000)).
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claims fail for the same reasons as her disability discrimination. (Mot. at 13.) Specifically, they argue that Plaintiff was not qualified to perform the essential functions of her position. ( [*41] Id.) The Court rejects this argument for the same reasons stated above.
Moreover, Defendants argue that the Bank allowed Plaintiff to take leave of absence when requested (DSUF ¶¶ 10, 19, 49, 61-62), and that Plaintiff failed to identify accommodation that was objectively available. (Mot. at 14.) However, as established above, Plaintiff raises a triable issue on this question. Plaintiff has also submitted evidence that Defendants failed to engage in a good faith and interactive process to determine the effectiveness of reasonable accommodations. Plaintiff submitted all required paperwork to support her request for accommodation. (PSUF ¶ 106.) Defendants could have, but did not, seek clarification on the specifics of Plaintiff's accommodation request. (Id. ¶ 108.) Nonetheless, Plaintiff's request was denied after conversations with California CEO Everett Orrick, Small and Medium Enterprises Network Executive Elizabeth Dobers, and Priem. (Priem Dep. Tr. 58:21-23; Orrick Dep. Tr. 25:17-20; Dobers Dep. Tr. 36:16-18.) Orrick never looked at any policies Defendants had in relation to accommodating disabilities in relation to Plaintiff. (PSUF ¶ 112.) Dobers was not aware that Plaintiff's request [*42]  for accommodation was related to a disability. (Id. ¶ 113.) Fincher then informed Plaintiff that Defendants denied her request for accommodation in its entirety, stating that meeting the incentive sales goals was an essential function of the job. (Id.; Fincher Dep. Tr. 43:9-20.) Fincher added that if Plaintiff continued in the BBO position, she would have to meet the expectations of the position. (PSUF ¶ 115; Fincher Decl. ¶ 7 ("I informed [Smith] that her sales goals/performance standards could not be reduced.").) Fincher told Plaintiff she could look for and apply to other positions, which Plaintiff did without success. (PSUF ¶ 124.)
A jury could conclude that this process did not amount to a "good faith, interactive process" to seek to accommodate Plaintiff. The Court therefore DENIES the Motion as to the second and third causes of action.

C. Retaliation (Fourth Cause of Action)
Under FEHA § 12940(h), an employer may not discriminate against any person because "the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(h). "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under [] FEHA, a plaintiff [*43]  must show (1) he or she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1020 (internal quotation omitted). Similarly, to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the CFRA, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) the defendant was an employer covered by CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, fine, or suspension, because of her exercise of her right to CFRA leave." Dudley v. Dep't of Transp., 90 Cal. App. 4th 255, 261, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 739 (2001).
Plaintiff argues that she engaged in protected activity when she went on FMLA leave, requested a reasonable accommodation, and filed a DFEH complaint. (Opp'n at 22.) She alleges that she was then subjected to an adverse action, as she was suddenly expected to meet 100% of substantially increased incentive goals. (Id.) Defendants first argue that Plaintiff did not suffer an adverse employment action (Mot. at 15), but the Court has already rejected that position.
Defendants next argue that there [*44]  is no causal nexus between any protected activity and any adverse employment action. (Id.) They note that "mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action" is only deemed to be "sufficient evidence of causality" where the temporal proximity is "very close." Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) (citing cases holding that a 3-and 4-month period is insufficient). As established above, the parties dispute several facts about the timing of Defendants' first notice of Plaintiff's disability and accommodation requests. (See, e.g., Reply to PSGD ¶ 40.) But construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as the Court must do, the Court concludes that a reasonable jury could find that there was "very close" temporal proximity between Plaintiff's protected activity (various medical leaves, accommodation requests, and DFEH complaint) and the adverse action (Defendants' requirement that Plaintiff meet or exceed her sales goals, disciplinary action for failure to do so, and denial of accommodation requests).
The Court therefore DENIES Defendants' Motion as to the fourth cause of action.

D. Failure to Prevent Retaliation and Discrimination (Fifth Cause of [*45]  Action)
A failure to prevent claim requires evidence of a "fail[ure] to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov. Code § 12490(k). "A plaintiff seeking to recover on a failure to prevent discrimination claim under FEHA must show that (1) [he] was subjected to discrimination; (2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination; and (3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 804 (N.D. Cal. 2015). Courts have interpreted "a failure to prevent discrimination claim [to be] essentially derivative of a [FEHA] discrimination claim." Id.
Defendants' arguments to dismiss the fifth cause of action are premised on their arguments about Plaintiff's discrimination and retaliation claims. As established above, these arguments are unavailing. By extension, the Court DENIES Defendants' Motion to dismiss Plaintiff's failure to prevent retaliation claim.5

E. Constructive Termination in Violation of Public Policy (Sixth Cause of Action)
To establish a constructive discharge claim, an employee must show that "the employer either intentionally created or knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at [*46]  the time of the employee's resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in the employee's position would be compelled to resign." Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 1251, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994). "The conditions giving rise to the resignation must be sufficiently extraordinary and egregious to overcome the normal motivation of a competent, diligent, and reasonable employee to remain on the job. . . ." (Id. at 1246.)
Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot establish that the Bank intentionally created or knowingly permitted such intolerable conditions. (Mot. at 17.) Defendants point to the evidence that Plaintiff's calls with her supervisor Kat Priem were "very positive and never negative" (DSUF ¶ 58), and Plaintiff's repeated expressions of gratitude to BBVA employees for their support (Id. ¶¶ 11, 18, 55).
Plaintiff counters that Defendants created intolerable working conditions by forcing her to work at a higher capacity than her non-disabled peers and requiring attainment of 100% of all incentive goals. (Smith Decl. ¶¶ 27, 34.) These actions, Plaintiff contends, made the job impossible for her and forced her resignation. (Opp'n at 24.) The Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff's claims do not amount to intolerable conditions [*47]  under the stringent standard by which constructive discharge claims are evaluated.
"In order to amount to a constructive discharge, adverse working conditions must be unusually 'aggravated' or amount to a 'continuous pattern' before the situation will be deemed intolerable." Turner, 7 Cal. 4th at 1247. "Demotion of an employee or criticism of his job performance—even if alleged to be unfair or outrageous—does not ... create the intolerable working conditions necessary to support a claim of constructive discharge." Gibson v. Aro Corp., 32 Cal. App. 4th 1628, 1636, 38 Cal. Rptr. 2d 882 (1995) (internal citation omitted). Even the "existence of illegal conduct in a workplace does not without more, render employment conditions intolerable to a reasonable employee." Turner, 7 Cal. 4th at 1255. Plaintiff does not present any authorities or sufficient evidence supporting her claim that her employment conditions could be construed as intolerable under this standard.
The Court therefore GRANTS summary judgment as to the sixth cause of action.

F. Punitive Damages
Each of Plaintiff's causes of action is based on state statutes and/or doctrines, so the availability of punitive damages here is a question of state law. Central Office Tel. v. AT&T Co., 108 F.3d 981, 993 (9th Cir. 1997), rev'd on other grounds, 524 U.S. 214, 228, 118 S. Ct. 1956, 141 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1998). Under California law, punitive damages may be appropriate "where it is proven by [*48]  clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294. Punitive damages are recoverable for FEHA violations. Yeager v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 944 F. Supp. 2d 913, 931 (E.D. Cal. 2013); Commodore Home Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court, 32 Cal. 3d 211, 220, 221, 185 Cal. Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912. Under FEHA, "[if] Defendant is a corporation, the evidence must demonstrate an officer, director or managing agent of Defendant committed, authorized or ratified an act of malice, oppression or fraud to create a genuine issue of material fact on punitive damages." Yeager, 944 F. Supp. 2d at 931.
Because Plaintiff's FEHA claims for disability discrimination and retaliation survive summary judgment, the Court finds it would be premature to dismiss her request for punitive damages. A review of the record indicates that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Defendants' managing agents and officers committed, authorized, or ratified discriminatory or retaliatory actions against Plaintiff. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion as to punitive damages.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The April 5, 2021 hearing is VACATED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
