REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS
LOCKE, Magistrate Judge:
Presently before the Court, on referral from the Honorable Sandra J. Feuerstein, in this employment discrimination and retaliation case are two motions, DE [48, 53]. First, Defendant Local 338 of the Retail, Wholesale, Department Store Union, United Food and Commercial Workers ("Defendant" or the "Union") moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff Carl Diaz's ("Plaintiff" or "Diaz") claims arising under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. ("FMLA"); the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. ("ADA"); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. ("Title VII"); the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. L. § 290 et seq. ("NYSHRL"); and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-101 et seq. ("NYCHRL"),1 and dismissal of the Amended Complaint. Second, Plaintiff [*2]  moves for partial summary judgment on his claim for retaliation under the FMLA. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court recommends to Judge Feuerstein that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted, Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment be denied, and the Amended Complaint be dismissed in its entirety.

I. Background
Except where noted, the following facts are not in dispute:

A. The Parties
Plaintiff was employed in various roles by the Union between November 16, 2001 and April 1, 2013. See Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1 ("Pl. 56.1 Resp."), DE [62], at ¶ 13. Plaintiff began as a Service Representative/Organizer in 2001 and was promoted to Union Representative in or about October 2007. See id. ¶¶ 14, 33. As discussed more fully below, in or around October 2012 Plaintiff was demoted back to Organizer and remained in that role until his employment ended on April 1, 2013. See id. ¶ 45.
The Union is a labor organization within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 152(5), and [*3]  maintains offices in Mineola, New York. See id. ¶ 6. At all relevant times, John Durso was the President of the Union, Murray Morrissey was Secretary-Treasurer, Elena Dundon was the Senior Director of Internal Operations, which included responsibility for employment matters, and Jack Caffey and Raymond Vetrano both held the title of "Director." See id. ¶¶ 8-12. In his capacity as Secretary-Treasurer, Morrissey supervised Caffey and Vetrano. See id. ¶ 9. At all relevant times, Caffey or Vetrano, and at times both, supervised Plaintiff. See id. ¶¶ 34, 50-51.

B. Plaintiff's Employment History
Union positions such as Service Representative, Organizer, and Union Representative are considered "field staff." See id. ¶ 15. It is undisputed that Plaintiff was a field staff member and that field staff members are "on call" at all times. Id. ¶ 17. To that end, the Union provided Plaintiff with a cellular phone. See id. ¶ 18.
Field staff members are generally required to work 35 hours per week, but occasionally employees work more or less than 35, depending on the circumstances. See, e.g., December 29, 2014 Declaration of Alexander Granovsky in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [*4]  ("12/29 Granovsky Decl."), at Ex. "23" (Relevant portions of Oct. 7, 2014 Deposition of Jack Caffey ("Caffey Dep.")), DE [64-23], at 26:12-23 ("Requirements [for the number of hours to be worked by salaried employees, including Plaintiff, are] normally eight hours a day with nothing else going on. . . . Meaning working between 8:30 and 5:00, 5:30"); id. at 152:17-22 (stating that a "normal week is about 35 hours," but that employees sometimes work more or less than that); see also id. at 28:25-29:4 (stating that employees worked 35 hours per week "[u]nless they were on a personal day or a sick day"); Pl. 56.1 Resp. at ¶¶ 27, 32 (including acknowledgments by Plaintiff of various documents identifying his work hours as 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. five days per week). Further, field staff members, such as Plaintiff, are required to keep supervisory staff apprised of their whereabouts during the workday. See, e.g., December 1, 2014 Declaration of Jae W. Chun in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("12/1 Chun Decl.") at Ex. "J" (Relevant portions of Oct. 10, 2014 Deposition of John Durso ("Durso Dep.")), DE [56-10], at 38:8-16 (stating that supervisors "should know if" field staff members [*5]  are "not where they're scheduled to be"); 12/29 Granovsky Decl. at Ex. "25" (Relevant portions of Sept. 4, 2014 Deposition of Carl Diaz ("Pl. Dep.")), DE [64-25], at 164:3-13 (testifying that "[i]f [he] was going to be late or out" he would inform his supervisors).
As noted above, in or around October 2007, Plaintiff was promoted from the position of Service Representative/Organizer to the position of Union Representative. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 33. As set forth above, both positions are considered "field staff" and therefore the change did not affect Plaintiff's obligation to be "on call" at all times. See id. ¶¶ 15, 17. Plaintiff alleges that he "performed all of his duties effectively" during this time, received "good performance reviews, raises and bonuses," and that he "was only subject to minor discipline, and only for minor infractions," such as "having a messy desk" and "calling a co-worker 'dog.'" Am. Compl., DE [34], ¶¶ 14, 18, 19. Consistent with this assertion, Diaz provides his performance reviews from 2007 to 2011, each indicating that his performance was consistently rated as either "3" "4" or "5" on a five-point scale. See November 5, 2014 Declaration of Alexander Granovsky [*6]  in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ("11/5 Granovsky Decl."), at Ex. "3" (Performance Evaluation Forms), DE [48-4]. It is undisputed that Plaintiff received increases in his base pay every year between 2008 and 2012. See Defendant's 56.1 Counterstatement to Plaintiff's Supplemental Statement of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1 ("Def. Supp. 56.1 Resp."), DE [68], at ¶ 38. However, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's performance began to decline in 2011 and was consistently substandard thereafter. See Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Def. Supp. Memo of Law"), DE [54], at 2.
In 2011 Plaintiff was reassigned from servicing shops located in New Jersey and Manhattan to shops in New Jersey, Staten Island, and Brooklyn. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 36-37. As a result, Plaintiff's workload increased substantially, causing him such great stress that he informed Caffey, his supervisor at the time, that his hair had begun falling out. Id. ¶¶ 38-39. Diaz further testified that he told coworkers he was "living out of a car" during this time. See 12/1 Chun Decl. at Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 120-212; see also id., Ex. "K" (Relevant portions [*7]  of Oct. 14, 2014 Deposition of Raymond Vetrano ("Vetrano Dep.")), DE [56-11], at 201:1 (stating that Diaz acknowledged "sleep[ing] in [his] car"). In fact, Plaintiff admitted that matters were sufficiently difficult that Vetrano offered to let him sleep at the Union's Westchester office. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 43.
Secretary-Treasurer Murray Morrissey stated, and Plaintiff does not dispute, that in 2011 Caffey advised him (Morrissey) that Plaintiff was "becoming more and more disorganized," "that he was constantly late for meetings," and that he "did not have a good grasp of the language in the various collective bargaining agreements." November 19, 2014 Declaration of Murray Morrissey in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Morrissey Decl."), DE [58], ¶ 4. It is undisputed that in February 2012, the Union effectively demoted Plaintiff from the position of Union Representative back to Organizer based on his poor performance. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 45, 50. Specifically, Defendant claims that the move was "to help [Plaintiff] with his time management" and provide "more flexibility with his" schedule. Morrissey Decl. ¶ 5. Despite not conceding that the change was a demotion, Plaintiff admits that Morrissey couched the announcement as "bad news," to which Plaintiff responded by asking if Morrissey was "kidding," and that he was "taken aback" and "upset" about [*9]  it. See 12/1 Chun Decl. at Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 125-26.3
It is undisputed that shortly after Plaintiff's demotion, in March 2012, he used the Union's credit card for personal purchases and attempted to reimburse the Union with a personal check. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 100-01. On or about March 6, 2012, Morrissey held a meeting with Plaintiff and explained that his conduct constituted a violation of Union policy. See id. ¶ 104; see also November 25, 2014 Declaration of Elena Dundon in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Dundon Decl."), at Ex. "E" (Mar. 6, 2012 Conversation Recap), DE [57-5]. On April 20, 2012, Morrissey "issue[d] a final written warning due to the seriousness of th[e] matter." Morrissey Decl. ¶¶ 13-14; see Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 108-09; December 8, 2014 Declaration of Jae W. Chun in Support of Defendant's Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ("12/8 Chun Decl."), at Ex. "E" (Apr. 20, 2012 Written Warning), DE [49-10]. The warning states that "[f]urther violations of any policy and/or performance standards will result in progressive disciplinary [*10]  action up to [and] including termination of employment." Id.
Defendant claims, and Plaintiff does not deny, that in May 2012, Vetrano and Caffey again informed Morrissey that Plaintiff "was unable to correct his behavior concerning time management, disorganization, and overall attitude towards his job." Morrissey Decl. ¶ 15. In fact, on or about May 4, 2012, a meeting was held between Plaintiff, Morrissey, Vetrano, and Caffey to address these concerns. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 142; Dundon Decl., Ex. "G" (May 4, 2012 Meeting Summary), DE [57-7]. Consistent with these issues, Plaintiff admitted that at the time he was demoted to Union Organizer, his performance was deteriorating, he was "slowing down," and it was "[b]ecoming more and more hard[] for [him] to sometimes get up in the morning or with the changing of the shifts, it was becoming difficult." 12/1 Chun Decl. at Ex "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 216-17. Then, on or about June 18, 2012, Morrissey issued yet another final written warning to Plaintiff citing misconduct including: arriving late for a Union meeting with food that he intended to eat until stopped by Caffey; arriving late for campaign meetings on a business trip in Virginia; responding [*11]  to requests for expense receipts by stating "I didn't get a chance to do them, they are at home, why are you dogging me, dog"; stating "If you want to bag me, then bag me"; verbally requesting a day off without submitting the required paperwork because he had left his Union-issued laptop at home; misplacing paperwork relating to a job assignment and attributing the error to "a lot of personal problems on [his] mind"; and maintaining a "desk area" that was "unorganized with paperwork and file folders" which resulted in Union employees' inability to locate items as needed. See 12/8 Chun Decl., Ex. "F" (June 20, 2012 Written Warning), DE [49-5]; see also Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 149-50 (failing to dispute the issuance of the final written warning). The warning further concluded that:
These incidents reflect that you do not demonstrate a sense of urgency, ability to prioritize, time management skills, or organizational abilities and a lack of respect for your supervisor. As a result of the above, and reflective of past performance issues discussed with you by your former supervisor, Jack Caffey, you are placed on a final written warning effective immediately. If your overall performance and behavior [*12]  continue to fall short of the organization's expectations and you are unable to meet the standards of the position, your employment will be terminated effective immediately.
The written warning indicates that Plaintiff "refused to sign" it, "claiming he feels that all of the incidents are minor. . . ." 12/8 Chun Decl., Ex. "F" (June 20, 2012 Written Warning), DE [49-5].4 The Union's allegations of Plaintiff's deficient performance in 2011 and 2012 are consistent with Diaz's 2012 year-end performance review which, for the first time, reflects a diminished rating of 2-out-of-5 in the categories of "[i]s consistently organized" and "[i]s consistently timely and sensitive regarding feedback to members/customers." 11/5 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "3", DE [48-4]. The Court notes that no performance reviews following Diaz's 2012 year-end evaluation are provided.

C. Plaintiff's Medical Leave
It is undisputed that after all of these events, including the two final written warnings, on or about November 9, 2012, Plaintiff suffered a severe heart attack, which serves as the underlying basis for his FMLA and ADA claims. See 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [*14]  [56-8], at 299-300; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 161. Following the heart attack, Plaintiff requested and the Union approved medical leave under the FMLA. See Dundon Decl., Ex. "I" (Nov. 12, 2012 Letter to Plaintiff), DE [57-9], (stating, in part, that the Union "placed [Plaintiff] on short-term disability and Family and Medical Leave Act ('FMLA') as of November 10, 2012").
It is undisputed that, pursuant to Union policy, before an employee on leave may return to work, he must provide a physician's note indicating that he is capable of doing so. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 162; Dundon Decl., Ex. "O" (Union Employee Handbook), DE [57-15], at 37. Consistent with this policy, on or about November 12, 2012, Dundon, on behalf of the Union, sent Plaintiff a letter regarding his rights and obligations concerning FMLA leave. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 163-64; Dundon Decl., Ex. "I" (Nov. 12, 2012 Letter to Plaintiff), DE [57-9], (stating, in part, that "[b]efore returning to work, we require a doctor's note indicating medical clearance of your return" and that "your doctor must specifically indicate whether you may return to work on full duty, or in the event of restricted duty, your doctor must specifically indicate the restrictions [*15]  and the approximate length of time of any restrictions").
At some point not made clear in the record, Plaintiff submitted a physician's note that reads, in pertinent part, "Mr. Diaz [is] undergoing some additional test[s] and cardiac rehab. He may drive and can not [sic] lift more than 25 lbs." See Dundon Decl., Ex. "K" (Physicians' Notes), DE [57-11]. It is unclear when this note was actually written, as the date reads "12/18/19," but it indicates that Plaintiff's "expected date to return to work is April 2013," suggesting that it was written, and reflected his condition, prior to returning. See id. Plaintiff also provided the Union with a physician's note dated March 7, 2013, which stated that Plaintiff "is going to start cardiac rehab on 3/8 & will be there for 36 visits. He can return for work on 3/25/13." Id.; see Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 170.
At or around the same time, Plaintiff also requested a meeting with John Durso, which took place on March 7, 2013. Dundon participated in the meeting and, according to Defendant, took contemporaneous notes, which were reduced to an internal memorandum. See Dundon Decl., Ex. "L" (Mar. 7, 2013 Memorandum), DE [57-12]. Dundon's memorandum indicates that "[Plaintiff] [*16]  informed [her] that he would need to attend cardiac rehab and that he was starting his first session later that week." Id. Dundon's memorandum also reflects that she advised Plaintiff he "would need to let his director know what the schedule for the rehab was" because she did not have knowledge of his work schedule and could not "say for certain that [the Union] would be able to work around those [cardiac rehab] appointments." Id. Dundon's account is consistent with Plaintiff's own testimony that if he was "going to be late, leave early, or going to be absent" he would notify his "immediate supervisors" and would not notify Dundon. See 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 165-66 (stating that he "never" called Dundon regarding an absence, late arrival, or the need to leave work early). However, Plaintiff denies that Dundon instructed him to advise his supervisors of his rehab schedule, claiming instead that Dundon indicated "she would convey it back to the directors." Id. at 308-09; see Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 172-73. In this regard, Plaintiff testified that Dundon, in her capacity as Director of Internal Operations, "handles that whole thing," but nevertheless admitted that Dundon does [*17]  not handle his schedule. 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 309.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff did, in fact, return to work on March 25, 2013, to the same position, pay, and benefits that he had before his leave. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 175-76.

D. Plaintiff's Alleged Disability
Plaintiff claims that he is disabled, within the meaning of the ADA, because he suffers from ischemic heart disease and "at the time of his discharge [from the hospital following his heart attack], . . . he needed cardiac rehabilitation and was subject to a lifting restriction." Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., DE [61], at 5; see Plaintiff's Supplemental Statement of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1 ("Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt."), DE [63], ¶¶ 41-42. However, the only record evidence of any limitations Plaintiff experienced as a result of his heart attack is his testimony that he "couldn't lift anything over 25 pounds for the first couple of months" and "[t]o this day [he] still can't lift anything over 30 pounds." 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 334-35. Plaintiff also relies upon a physician's note, which states that may not lift more than 25 pounds. See Dundon Decl., Ex. [*18]  "K" (Physicians' Notes), DE [57-11].5 There is no other restriction identified.
Plaintiff's medical records, dated June 13, 2013, further indicate that he has a history of heart disease, including a previous heart attack, which predates the events in this litigation. See 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "18" (Cardiology Progress Notes), DE [64-18], at 2 of 3. The records do not indicate the date of his prior heart attack or diagnosis, but Plaintiff does not allege that he was rendered disabled prior to his 2012 heart attack, and affirmatively states that he experienced no discriminatory treatment prior to February 2012. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 77. There is no evidence that Plaintiff communicated his medical history or prior heart attack to the Union.

E. Plaintiff's Return from Medical Leave
The parties largely dispute the events that took place during the week of March 25, 2013, the first week after [*19]  Diaz returned to work from leave. It is undisputed, however, that Plaintiff requested a three-week vacation on his first day back. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 177 (Defendant claims the request was for three consecutive weeks; Plaintiff could not recall the requested length).
It is also undisputed that Caffey assigned Plaintiff intermittent duties staffing a picket line that week, which totaled approximately 12 hours. See id. ¶ 185; see also 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "15" (Plaintiff's Outlook Calendar Entries for Mar. 26-Apr. 1, 2013), DE [64-15]. Plaintiff alleges to have satisfactorily performed these assigned duties. See Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., DE [61], at 22 (arguing that "Plaintiff did everything required of him during his 6 days back at work. . . ."); see also Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶¶ 74-83. However, Defendant contends that Plaintiff only attended the 12 hours of intermittent duties specifically assigned to him, this totaling four hours per day, and had not otherwise worked full eight-hour days as required. See, e.g., 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "23" (Caffey Dep.), DE [64-23], at 151:7-152:10 (stating that field staff members are "required to put [*20]  in a full day's work regardless of [a particular] assignment"). In that regard, Caffey testified that in addition to intermittent duties, he had specifically instructed Plaintiff to contact other Union organizers to "help out" with ongoing projects in order to fill the remainder of his workweek. See Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1 ("Def.'s 56.1 Stmt."), DE [55], at ¶ 187; see also 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "I" (Caffey Dep.), DE [56-9] at 252:6-15. According to Caffey, this was intended to "ease [Plaintiff] back into work given that he was out for a period of time. . . ." Id. at 252:20-253:2. Plaintiff disputes being directed or required to contact other organizers to seek out work. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 187.6 Accordingly, Defendant contends, and Plaintiff does not dispute, that Plaintiff did not contact other organizers to "help out" with ongoing projects. See Morrissey Decl. ¶¶ 21-22.

F. Plaintiff's Termination
It is undisputed that on April 1, 2013, the first day of Plaintiff's second week back at work, Diaz was scheduled to be present at a worksite in Queens at 11:00 a.m. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 192; 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "15" (Plaintiff's Outlook Calendar Entries for Mar. 26-Apr. 1, 2013), DE [64-15]. Plaintiff scheduled cardiac rehabilitation that morning from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. in New Jersey "[b]ecause he knew that he did not have to be [at the worksite] until later that morning." Am. Compl., DE [34] ¶ 30; see Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 188, 203; 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "25" (Pl. Dep.), DE [*24]  [64-27], at 357-61 (explaining that he attended cardiac rehab from approximately 7:15 a.m. to approximately 8:25 a.m.). However, Plaintiff's reasoning is contrary to Defendant's contention, described above, that Plaintiff's workday began at 8:00 or 8:30 a.m., requiring him to be on-call that time, and that his 11:00 a.m. assignment was but a small part of his regular obligation to work a full eight-hour day. See, e.g., id., Ex. "23" (Caffey Dep.), [64-23], at 151:7-152:10 (stating that field staff members are "required to put in a full day's work regardless of [a particular] assignment").
It is undisputed that Plaintiff never directly informed Caffey, his supervisor at the time, that he would be attending cardiac rehabilitation on the morning of April 1, 2013. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 202. However, Plaintiff's Outlook Calendar entry for April 1, 2013, to which Caffey testified he had access, reflected the appointment from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. See 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "15", DE [64-15]; see also id., Ex. "23" (Caffey Dep.), DE [64-23], at 27-28 (explaining that field staff is expected to document daily activities in Outlook calendars to which he has access). This is consistent with [*25]  Plaintiff's own testimony that, prior to returning from leave, he advised Dundon he would only require "an hour" for cardiac rehabilitation three times per week. See id., Ex. "25" (Pl. Dep.), [64-26], at 308:5-6.
In any event, Plaintiff alleges that he had not been permitted to use his cell phone during his rehabilitation session. See Am. Compl., DE [34], ¶ 31. It is undisputed that at approximately 8:15 a.m., Caffey attempted to call Plaintiff on his Union cell phone, received no answer, and left a voicemail. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 191. Although Plaintiff's appointment was scheduled and reflected on his calendar as lasting until 8:00 a.m., he testified that he "got out of rehab" at "[a]bout a quarter to 9:00" or "[a]bout 9:00" a.m. 12/1 Chun Decl., at Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 354.
Defendant claims that the purpose of Caffey's call was to inform Plaintiff that the location of his 11:00 a.m. assignment had changed. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 193. After attempting to reach Plaintiff, Caffey contacted other field staff members who had been assigned to the same worksite as Plaintiff and, at Caffey's request, one of them also left a voicemail for Plaintiff regarding the change in location. See Pl. 56.1 [*26]  Resp. ¶¶ 194-95, 197-98; see also Declaration of Nelson Resto in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Resto Dep."), DE [60], at ¶¶ 1, 4-5 (stating that on April 1, 2013, he was a Union organizer assigned to the same worksite as Plaintiff and that Caffey had contacted him to inquire as to Plaintiff's whereabouts). According to Morrissey, on the morning of April 1, 2013, Caffey also informed him that he had been unable to contact Plaintiff for "a couple of hours," while he was in cardiac rehab. Morrissey Decl. ¶ 20. It is undisputed that when Plaintiff and Caffey eventually did speak, at approximately 10:15 a.m., Diaz took issue with the manner in which Caffey spoke to him and later testified that he "ain't going to put up with that." Pl. 56.1 Rep. ¶¶ 204, 206. It is undisputed that Caffey stated "I've had it. I'm done," to which Plaintiff responded, "Whatever, man." Id. ¶¶ 207-08.
Plaintiff eventually arrived at the assigned location. However, the parties dispute whether he arrived on time. Compare 12/1 Chun Decl., at Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 342, 373 (contending that Diaz arrived on time); Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 210-11 (same); with 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "I" (Caffey [*27]  Dep.), DE [56-9], at 263:13-15 (testifying that on April 1, 2013 he was informed by Union employees that Plaintiff had not arrived by 11:00 a.m.); Resto Decl. ¶ 4 (stating that on April 1, 2013, Plaintiff arrived at the worksite at 11:45 a.m.); Morrissey Decl. ¶¶ 20-24 (indicating that he had been informed that Plaintiff "did not know which [worksite] he was supposed to report to at 11:00 a.m., and that he was eventually late").
It is undisputed that, after arriving at the worksite, Plaintiff was instructed to attend a meeting at the Union's Mineola, New York offices. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 220. Defendant claims, and Diaz does not dispute, that Morrissey scheduled the meeting and informed Durso, the Union's President, of the possibility that Plaintiff would be terminated. See Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 221; Morrissey Decl. ¶ 24. This is consistent with Durso's testimony concerning the Union's practice for conducting such meetings—namely, that Morrissey and Dundon advise him beforehand that a meeting is scheduled and that it may result in a termination. 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "J" (Relevant portions of Oct. 10, 2014 deposition of John Durso ("Durso Dep.")), DE [56-10], at 203-04. According to Durso, [*28]  Morrissey and Dundon then have discretion, based on what occurs at the meeting, to effectuate the termination. See id. Durso testified that this account accurately reflects the extent of his involvement in Plaintiff's termination decision, see id., and Diaz does not provide evidence to the contrary.
The April 1, 2013 meeting was attended by Plaintiff, Caffey, Dundon, and Morrissey. As with prior meetings concerning Plaintiff's performance, Dundon contemporaneously recorded the minutes, which were then memorialized in an internal memorandum. See Dundon Decl., Ex. "M" (Apr. 1, 2013 Memorandum (the "Termination Memo")), DE [57-13].
The Termination Memo provides in relevant part:
Murray opened by stating, "Carl we have a problem we need to discuss. . . . There have been a number of issues that we have spoken about and I thought we had an understanding, but it turns out we don't." Carl is breathing heavy and Murray asks, "Are you okay?" Carl stated, "I have a problem breathing it's from the medication, but I'm okay." Murray continues, "You came back after a period of time of being out, six months." Carl cut Murray off and states, "It wasn't my fault." Murray states, "I didn't say it was, but [*29]  you were out for a period of time." Carl states, "It wasn't six months." Murray asks, "Well since you keep cutting me off, how long was it?" Carl states, "It was less than six months." Carl does not state the specific number of weeks he was out (20 weeks in total November 10, 2012 — March 22, 2013). Murray states, "You come back to work last week and the first I hear is that you want to take three weeks off to go to Puerto Rico to settle your father's estate, then I hear you can take care of it in a few days. If you can take care of it in a few days, why would you ask for three weeks? First of all it isn't even our policy to approve three consecutive weeks." Carl interjects and says, "I'm an adult I can defend myself. I did everything that was asked of me when I was out. . . . I own property there, if you owned property you would want to take care of it — right?" Carl is becoming agitated . . . Carl says, "I'm sorry that I'm coming across sarcastic, after everything I've been through, Murray I was flat lined, I died 'dog' I thought you cared about me.["] Murray responds, "I do care about you; this is not about you as a person, it is about how you handle things." Carl responds, "During [*30]  this morning in speaking to Mr. Caffey I was told to call Ray [Vetrano] and then Ray says come to the office. . . . I was thinking what did I do wrong? The only thing I did wrong was not tell Jack and Ray about my cardiac rehab." Murray states, "You were wrong not to tell either of the directors about your cardiac rehab." Carl states, "That was my mistake."
Dundon Decl., Ex. M (Termination Memo), DE [57-13].
During the meeting, Morrissey also asked Plaintiff about the amount he had worked since March 25, 2013:
Murray asks, "Other than the Trade Fair and cardiac rehab, what did you do last week, where did you go after 3:00 p.m.?" Carl asks, "Can I check my calendar?" Murray, "Yes." Carl, "Monday I came to the office after rehab. Tuesday I was at Trade Fair." Murray asks, "Where did you go after Trade Fair [at 3:00 p.m.]?" Carl, "I went home after Trade Fair. Like I told [Dundon] I have changed I leave earlier now because I can't take the stress of being in traffic so I avoid it." Murray asks, "What time is your cardiac rehab?" Carl states, "7:00-8:00 in the morning." Murray asks, "From 8:00-11:00 what were you doing for 338 [the Union]?" Carl states, "I didn't do anything for 338, I'm [*31]  not in an organizing campaign. I have to drive home still and I consider that part of my work time." Murray asks, "Were you instructed by Jack or Ray that you had to contact other organizers to campaign assignment [sic]?" Carl, "No!" Murray asks, "Do you think that 11:00-3:00 constituted your work for 338?" Carl states, "I don't steal time. . . . You know I march to my own beat, I do things a little differently than everybody else." Carl's tone is becoming more agitated as he speaks. Murray says, "Yes, you seem to march to your own drum, and we can't have it anymore. When you are being paid to work a full week and you are not, it is a problem. You are not new and you are not new to a conversation like this. You knew you should have certainly spoken to somebody about it. . . . [Y]our reasoning is a problem; it doesn't work. In your position we have a liability; you create a liability for the organization[,] for our members, you are being paid to work full time and you are doing your own thing." Carl responds very agitated, "I'm not stealing time Murray." Murray says, "This is painful for me to have to do, but it fell to me, it's my job . . . [Dundon] will walk take you through the [severance] [*32]  package." Carl asks, "You are firing me?" Murray, "I am terminating you today."
Id. Although Diaz attempts to deny the content of the Termination Memo, his deposition testimony belies the denial. In fact, Diaz does not meaningfully dispute the contents of this conversation, testifying at his deposition that he "vaguely" recalled the discussion and only remembered "some of the stuff that was said." 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "25" (Pl. Dep.), DE [64-27], at 378-80. When asked if Morrissey inquired about Plaintiff's failure to tell his supervisors about his cardiac rehab on April 1, 2013, Diaz testified that he could not recall. Id. When asked if Morrissey inquired about the amount of time he had worked the prior week, Plaintiff again testified that he could not recall. Id. at 379. Plaintiff's only record evidence concerning the account provided in the Termination Memo is Plaintiff's testimony that Morrissey asked him "why [he] didn't call or why didn't [he] let this person know that." Id. at 377. Plaintiff also testified that he recalled Morrissey opening the meeting by stating that Plaintiff had been out for six months. See id. at 391.7
The Termination Memo reflects that Dundon attempted to review a proposed severance package with Plaintiff at the April 1, 2013 meeting, but that Plaintiff refused:
[Dundon] attempt[ed] to review the separation package. Carl says, "You can keep your package. You can speak to my attorney. I should have stayed out on disability the full time." . . . [Dundon] again attempt[ed] to review the separation package and Carl stands and [Dundon] ask[s] him for his [Union] car keys, credit cards, swipe and phone. Carl says, You are evil; you have ruined the 338 family, do you know what people say about you, you are ugly." . . . Jack moves toward Carl in an attempt to move him out of the conference room saying, "I'll help you get your things from the car." Carl steps back puts his hands up as a block and says to Jack, "Don't put your hands on me. Get away from me." [Dundon] say[s] to Carl, [*34]  "We will call the police; there is no need for this behavior." Carl moves toward the door to leave, Jack is positioned between Carl who is in the doorway and the entry way to the conference room and Carl says in an implied threatening manner to [Dundon], "You are ugly, evil. God is watching you, what you do and your daughters." . . . As Carl is walking through the hall toward the doorway leading out into the field staff area Carl says, "You haven't heard the last of me, you'll hear from my attorney." . . . Jack met with John [Durso], Murray and [Dundon] and said that before leaving Carl told Jack he needed his medical [insurance] and asked Jack to see what he could do. Jack said he told Carl that he should have list[en]ed to the information [Dundon] had regarding the package. After some discussion, John [Durso] asked that [Dundon] overnight Carl the severance offer with the direction that the enhanced severance option would be available for 48 hours and a neutral letter of reference would be included provided he accepted within 48 hours.
Dundon Decl., Ex. "M" (Termination Memo), DE [57-13].
The only evidence in the record is that the termination decision was solely Morrissey's. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. [*35]  ¶ 238 (indicating that Plaintiff does not possess knowledge or information sufficient to dispute this fact).

G. Allegations of Ethnicity/National Origin Discrimination
In addition to the conduct described in the chronology above, Plaintiff alleges that "there was widespread discrimination on the bases of national origin and ethnicity" within the Union. It is undisputed, however, that Plaintiff did not experience allegedly discriminatory treatment before February 2012. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 77. It should also be noted that Plaintiff does not make a claim that the Union maintained an unlawful hostile work environment on this basis.8 Rather, he only alleges a cause of action for discrimination which resulted in his termination. That being said, Plaintiff relies on a variety of allegations in support of his claim.
To support his national origin/ethnicity discrimination cause of action, Diaz refers to several alleged discriminatory comments made by supervisors and coworkers.

1. Allegedly Discriminatory Remarks
a. Director Ray Vetrano
Plaintiff claims that Vetrano called him a "spic several times" and made statements along the lines of "[y]ou Puerto Ricans always carry a switchblade." Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶¶ 46-48. Plaintiff could not recall when or the number of times that this allegedly occurred, or the context in which the remarks were made, but testified that Vetrano used the word "spic" "every year." See 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 381. Vetrano denied making such statements. See January 12, 2015 Declaration of Cristina Gallo in Further Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Gallo Decl."), Ex. "B" (Relevant portions of Oct. 14, 2014 deposition of Raymond Vetrano ("Vetrano Dep."), DE [69], at 97, 99. Similarly, Caffey testified that he has never heard Vetrano use the word "spic." 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "I" (Caffey Dep.), DE [56-9], at 105-06.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not report Vetrano's alleged [*37]  remarks to the Union or a government agency. See 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 381 (in response to the question "[s]o you didn't report it to anyone in your union?" Plaintiff answered "[a]bsolutely not"); id. at 382 (in response to the question "[s]o did you file a complaint when [Vetrano] allegedly called you a spic with any government agency apart from the current, instant lawsuit?" Plaintiff answered, "[n]o"); see id. at 383-84 (same).
Plaintiff also relies upon an internal memorandum reflecting the minutes of a post-termination April 2014 meeting between Morrissey, Durso, Dundon, Caffey, and two other Union employees. See 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "31" (Apr. 9, 2014 Memo), DE [64-33]. According to the memo, the meeting was held to address an accusation by an African-American employee named Patricia Thompson that Vetrano had referred to her as "Kunta Kinte" in the presence of other employees. See id. Vetrano testified that the accusation was false and that the Union had later determined Thompson's account to be "unfounded." Gallo Decl., Ex. "B" (Vetrano Dep.), DE [69-2], at 96-97.
b. Director Jack Caffey
Plaintiff also alleges that Caffey called him a "spic" "several times." 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "25" [*38]  (Pl. Dep.), DE [64-25], at 51:12-16; see Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶ 46-47. Plaintiff could not recall the first time Caffey allegedly did so, 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "25" (Pl. Dep.), DE [64-25], at 51, and did not testify concerning the number of times or the context in which the alleged remarks were made. However, Plaintiff described his relationship with Caffey as "brothers" and characterized aspects of this relationship as merely "cruel humor" and admitted that he "may have" called Caffey a "guinea bastard," but could not specifically recall. Id. at 50-52.
Consistent with Diaz's testimony, Caffey admitted that he had called Plaintiff a "spic" "[i]n jest" because the two "were very good friends" and "[i]t was never derogatory as far as [Plaintiff] as a person." 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "I" (Caffey Dep.), DE [56-9], at 94:6-23. Caffey also testified that when he used the word "spic" he was not Plaintiff's supervisor, and that Plaintiff would call him a "guinea bastard" because Caffey was "half Italian." Id. at 107:12-22.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff and Caffey spent considerable time outside of work socializing. In this regard, Plaintiff testified that "men are men sometimes, they say things. It[] [*39]  stays between us." 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "25" (Pl. Dep.), DE[64-25], at 50.
c. President John Durso
Plaintiff further alleges that Durso discriminated against employees that were not of Italian ancestry. In support of this claim, Plaintiff asserts that during a Union staff meeting, Durso stated that "there are only two kinds of people, Italians, and people who want to be Italian." Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶ 50; 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "25" (Pl. Dep.), DE [64-26], at 277:7-278:12. Defendant does not dispute this account—Durso testified that the statement is "a line from [the] movie 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding'" and that "[i]t was a joke" and "we were laughing." 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "J" (Durso Dep.), DE [56-10], at 139:10-12; see Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶ 50 n.1. Plaintiff also claims that Durso once stated "What do you know, you're not Italian?" but does not allege that the comment was directed at him. 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 289:15-290:4.9
In this regard, there is no claim that Morrissey, who was responsible for the termination decision, ever heard or had knowledge of the alleged discriminatory remarks by Vetrano, Caffey, [*41]  or Durso.

2. Other Allegations of Ethnicity/National Origin Discrimination
In addition to the allegedly discriminatory remarks outlined above, Plaintiff makes a variety of generalized allegations relating to the Union's treatment of minorities. Initially Plaintiff claims, without support in the record, that "[e]very single upper level Union employee is Caucasian" and that Plaintiff "was supervised solely by Caucasians." Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶¶ 52-53. In making this claim, Plaintiff relies on selected portions of the deposition transcripts of Caffey and Durso, wherein Plaintiff's counsel recites a finite list of former and present Union employees and, for each individual, asks the deponents to state his or her race. Such an exercise can hardly be said to establish that "every single" upper level Union employee is white, or that Plaintiff was supervised "solely" by Caucasians. Defendant disputes this allegation, and specifically identifies four employees, each holding the title of "Director," including Caffey, who are either Hispanic, African-American, or, in the case of Caffey, is partly of Native American origin. See Def. Supp. 56.1 Resp., DE [68], ¶ 53. In addition, Plaintiff does [*42]  not dispute that, with one exception, every employee holding the title of "Organizer" is Hispanic. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 70-71.
Next, Plaintiff provides a series of 11 "warnings" (e.g., memoranda, letters, and similar documentation reflecting disciplinary action) issued by the Union between 2004 and 2014, an average of one per year. See 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "34" (Union "Warnings"), DE [64-36]. Diaz claims that these particular warnings were culled from personnel files of 28 Union employees who have held the same position as Plaintiff, which were produced during discovery in this litigation. See Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶ 55. Without regard for the circumstances surrounding the underlying incidents or the nature of the conduct giving rise to the disciplinary action, Plaintiff observes that of the 11 warnings, only one was issued to a Caucasian employee (as opposed to, inter alia, seven to Hispanics). See id. Thus, Plaintiff concludes that "the Union disciplines minority employees more than nine times as often as Caucasian employees." See Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., DE [61], at 13. Defendant disputes that the proffered conclusion may be drawn, contending [*43]  that the data contained in the warnings do not identify the race of the individuals subject to the discipline. See Def. Supp. 56.1 Resp., DE [68], ¶ 55.
Third, Plaintiff provides an unidentified three-page document, entitled only "Section IV" the contents of which Plaintiff claims represent "a true and correct copy of the Union's demographics during Plaintiff's employment." 12/29 Granovsky Decl., DE [64], ¶ 36. The material contains data in a chart that purport to show the race, gender, and relative age (over/under 40) of Union employees during a specified time period. See id. The Court notes that while the document states that the covered time period is "during Plaintiff's employment," more specific information is not directly reflected thereon. In any event, it is undisputed that the data reveal that of the fourteen Union employees terminated for performance since 2005, at least six (Plaintiff claims seven) were Hispanic, and four were Caucasian. See Def. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [68], ¶¶ 57-58. The conclusion Plaintiff urges to be drawn is that "the Union terminates Hispanic employees more than three times as often as Caucasian employees." See Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for [*44]  Summ. J., DE [61], at 13.
Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Italian-Americans received preferential treatment within the Union. See, e.g., Am. Compl., DE [34], ¶ 15; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 271. However, the only record evidence supporting this claim comes in the form of remarks by Durso, outlined above. See supra at 25. Defendant disputes this claim by identifying a former Union employee named Guy James as a similarly-situated comparator. See Def.'s 56.1 Stmt., DE [55], ¶ 271. James, who the parties agree was Italian-American, see Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 271, was determined by the Union to be "stealing time"—i.e., claiming to be working when he was not. See 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "16" (Conversation Recap—Guy James Resignation), DE [64-16]. The contemporaneous minutes of the meeting at which James was confronted reveal circumstances strikingly similar to those surrounding the April 1, 2013 meeting: Morrissey inquired into James's whereabouts on certain days, which were contradicted by his EZ-Pass statements and his calendar entries. See id. Morrissey confronted James about inaccurate record-keeping, overbilling for expenses, and other related misconduct. See id. The Union offered James a choice, as they [*45]  had with Plaintiff, between accepting an enhanced severance package and neutral letter of reference or being terminated for cause; James chose the former. See id.
Plaintiff disputes that James is a similarly-situated comparator for three reasons: (i) he is identified on an undated Staff Evaluation Form as "supervisor" to Sefton Rodney, see 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "36" (Staff Evaluation Form), DE [64-38]; (ii) the Union allegedly undertook an "extensive investigation" of James's "EZ-Pass records, calendars, and expense reports," which was not done for Plaintiff, see Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶ 61; and (iii) he resigned and received an enhanced severance package. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 271.

II. Procedural History
Based on the foregoing events, on or about July 12, 2013, Plaintiff filed a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights and cross-filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). See Am. Compl., DE [34], ¶ 6. The complaint was dismissed for "administrative convenience" on November 5, 2013, see id., Ex. "A" (Determination and Order of Dismissal for Administrative Convenience), and Plaintiff received a Notification of Right to Sue from [*46]  the EEOC on December 4, 2014. See id., Ex. "B" (Dismissal and Notice of Rights). Plaintiff commenced this action on or about December 18, 2013, alleging that he was unlawfully terminated from his employment with the Union because of his disability and/or his national origin and ethnicity, and because he took protected leave related to a serious health condition. The Amended Complaint contains five remaining causes of action under the FMLA, the ADA, Title VII, the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL.
On November 5, 2014, Plaintiff moved, DE [48], for partial summary judgment on his FMLA claim. The Union opposed the motion on or about December 8, 2014, DE [49], and on January 5, 2015, Judge Feuerstein issued an electronic Order referring it to the undersigned for a Report and Recommendation. In addition, on or about December 1, 2014, the Union moved, DE [53-60], for summary judgment as to each of Plaintiff's remaining claims and dismissal of the Amended Complaint. Plaintiff opposed the motion on or about December 29, 2014, DE [61-64], and on January 13, 2015, Judge Feuerstein issued an electronic Order referring it to the undersigned for a Report and Recommendation.

III. Standard of Review

A. Summary [*47]  Judgment
A party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of proving that there exists no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. "Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case." Maxton v. Underwriter Labs, Inc., 4 F. Supp. 3d 534, 542 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). "An issue of fact is considered 'genuine' when a reasonable finder of fact could render a verdict in favor of the non-moving party." Id. "In considering a summary judgment motion, 'the court's responsibility is not to resolve disputed issues of fact but to assess whether there are any factual issues to be tried, while resolving ambiguities and drawing reasonable inferences against the moving party.'" Id. (quoting Knight v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., 804 F.2d 9, 11 (2d Cir. 1986)). "If the Court recognizes any material issues of fact, summary judgment is improper, and the motion must be denied." Id. (citing Eastway Constr. Corp. v. City of New York, 762 F.2d 243, 249 (2d Cir. 1985)).
"Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party 'must do more than simply show there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. . . . [T]he nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Decter v. Second Nature Therapeutic Program, LLC, 13-cv-3519, 42 F. Supp. 3d 450, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124484, at *14 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2014) (quoting Caldarola v. Calabrese, 298 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir. 2002)). "As the Supreme Court stated in Anderson [*48] , '[i]f the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.'" Id. (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505). This standard applies with equal force in employment discrimination cases. See Ibraheem v. Wackenhut Servs., 29 F. Supp. 3d 196, 207 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) ("'[E]ven in the discrimination context, a plaintiff must provide more than conclusory allegations of discrimination to defeat a motion for summary judgment.'" (quoting Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir. 1997))).
"When the parties cross-move for summary judgment, 'the standard is the same as that for individual motions for summary judgment.'" Alliance Indus. v. Longyear Holdings, Inc., 854 F. Supp. 2d 321, 327 (W.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Natural Res. Def. Council v. Evans, 254 F. Supp. 2d 434, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)). "'The court must consider each motion independently of the other and, when evaluating each, the court must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.'" Id.

B. McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting Framework
Plaintiff's claims under the FMLA, the ADA, Title VII, and the NYSHRL are analyzed using the burden-shifting framework articulated by the United States Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See, e.g., Ruiz v. County of Rockland, 609 F.3d 486, 491 (2d Cir. 2010) (examining Title VII claims for national origin and race discrimination under McDonnell Douglas framework); McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009) (examining ADA claims under McDonnell Douglas framework); Potenza v. City of New York, 365 F.3d 165, 168 (2d Cir. 2004) (applying McDonnell Douglas framework to retaliation claim under the FMLA); Brown v. Northrop Grumman Corp. [*49] , 12-cv-1488, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116188, at *12-*13 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 2014) (noting that claims under the FMLA, the ADA, Title VII, and the NYSHRL are analyzed using the McDonnell Douglas framework (citations omitted)); Lew v. Radiation Dynamics, 995 F. Supp. 106, 112 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (examining allegations of national original discrimination under McDonnell Douglas framework).
Under this analysis, a plaintiff must "first establish a prima facie case, after which the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." Brown, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116188, at *13 (citing Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2008)). "Once the defendant provides such a reason, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to present competent evidence that the reasons offered by the Defendant were not the true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination or retaliation." Id. (citing Fleming v. MaxMara USA, Inc., 371 F. App'x 115, 117 (2d Cir. 2010); Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., 584 F.3d 487, 499 (2d Cir. 2009)). "'[T]he factfinder's rejection of the employer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action does not compel judgment for the plaintiff.'" Viruet v. Citizen Advice Bureau, 01-cv-4595, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15045, at *40 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2002) (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 146-49, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (emphasis in original)). The Supreme Court has advised that:
The ultimate question is whether the employer intentionally discriminated. . . . In other words, 'it is not enough . . . to disbelieve the employer; the factfinder must believe the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination.' . . . Whether judgment as a matter of law [or summary judgment] is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors. Those include the strength of the [*50]  plaintiff's prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.
Id. at *40-*42 (quoting Reeves, 530 U.S. at 146-49) (brackets in original).

C. NYCHRL Claims
Discrimination claims under the NYCHRL, like their state and federal counterparts, are analyzed using the McDonnell Douglas framework." Varughese v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr., 12-cv-8812, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43758, at *102 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2015) (citations omitted). However, as recently noted in EEOC v. Bloomberg L.P., 967 F. Supp. 2d 816, 835 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), "district courts 'must analyze NYCHRL claims separately and independently from any federal and state law claims' and 'constru[e] the NYCHRL's provisions broadly in favor of discrimination plaintiffs, to the extent that such a construction is reasonably possible'" (quoting Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux North America, Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 109 (2d Cir. 2013)). Noting that "it remains 'unclear whether, and to what extent the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis has been modified for NYCHRL claims,'" Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110 n.8, the Bloomberg court observed that "what remains clear is that the NYCHRL has 'simplified the discrimination inquiry: the plaintiff need only show that her employer treated her less well [than other similarly situated employees], at least in part for discriminatory [*51]  reasons. The employer may present evidence of its legitimate, non-discriminatory motives to show the conduct was not caused by discrimination, but it is entitled to summary judgment on this basis only if the record established as a matter of law that discrimination played no role in its actions.'" Bloomberg, 967 F. Supp. 2d at 836 (quoting Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110 n.8 (emphasis in original)).

IV. Analysis
With these standards in mind, the Court turns to the parties' respective motions for summary judgment.

A. Plaintiff's FMLA Claim
Diaz's FMLA retaliation cause of action fails as a matter of law. "To make out a prima facie case of retaliation under the FMLA, Plaintiff 'must establish that: 1) [he] exercised rights protected under the FMLA; 2) [he] was qualified for his position; 3) [he] suffered an adverse employment action; and 4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of retaliatory intent.'" Brown, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116188, at *36 (quoting Potenza, 365 F.3d at 168). Here, the parties do not dispute that Plaintiff exercised his rights under the FMLA, that he was qualified for his position, or that he suffered an adverse employment action in the form of termination. The question presented in the parties' motions is whether the evidence of the circumstances surrounding [*52]  Plaintiff's termination permits an inference of retaliatory intent.
In this regard, Plaintiff argues that the "close temporal proximity between Plaintiff's FMLA leave and his termination [less than two weeks later] is sufficient to establish" an inference of retaliatory intent. Pl. Memo of Law in Supp. of Mot. for P. Summ. J., DE [48-1], at 6-7. While "[t]he Second Circuit has stated that 'a plaintiff can indirectly establish a causal connection to support a discrimination or retaliation claim by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse [employment] action,'" Brown, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116188, at *38-*39 (quoting Gorman-Bakos v. Cornell Co-op Extension of Schenectady Cnty., 252 F.3d 545, 554 (2d Cir. 2001)), where it has found such an inference, "there also existed other evidence to support" it. Ibraheem, 29 F. Supp. 3d at 213 (citing Espinal v. Goord, 558 F.3d 119, 129-30 (2d Cir. 2009)); see Jain v. McGraw-Hill Cos., 506 F. App'x 47, 48 (2d Cir. 2012) (affirming summary judgment and dismissal of FMLA retaliation claim where "[t]he only record evidence indicative of retaliation [wa]s the fact that [the plaintiff] was fired on the day that she returned from FMLA leave"; reaffirming that "'[w]here timing is the only basis of a claim for retaliation, and gradual adverse job actions began well before the plaintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an inference of retaliation does not arise.'" (quoting Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance Am. Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir. 2011))). Here, viewing the facts in the light [*53]  most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court is unable to discern any probative evidence, beyond mere temporal proximity, sufficient to raise an issue of fact as to retaliatory intent, thereby precluding Plaintiff from establishing a prima facie claim.
However, even assuming arguendo that the temporal proximity between Diaz's FMLA leave and his termination created circumstances sufficient to give rise to an inference of retaliatory intent and establish a prima facie case, Plaintiff cannot show that the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Plaintiff's termination were pretextual and sufficient to defeat summary judgment.
The evidence indicates that well before Plaintiff's heart attack and resultant FMLA leave, he was at risk of losing his job for poor performance and had been subject to progressive disciplinary action. It is undisputed that Plaintiff was effectively demoted in 2011 after an unsuccessful tenure as a Union Representative and that same year Plaintiff's supervisors reported to Morrissey that Plaintiff was "becoming more and more disorganized," "that he was constantly late for meetings," and that he "did not have a good grasp of the language in the various collective bargaining [*54]  agreements." It is undisputed that in March 2012, approximately six months prior to Plaintiff's heart attack and medical leave, he was reprimanded and issued a "final written warning" based on his misuse of the Union's credit card for personal purchases. That warning explicitly admonished that "[f]urther violations of any policy and/or performance standards will result in progressive disciplinary action up to [and] including termination of employment." The undisputed evidence further demonstrates that in May 2012, also prior to Diaz's FMLA leave, Union management held a meeting with Plaintiff to discuss their concerns, and subsequently issued him a second "final written warning" for a litany of workplace misconduct including lateness for meetings, disrespect toward supervisors, and disorganization. The second written warning again explicitly warned that "[i]f your overall performance and behavior continue to fall short of the organization's expectations and you are unable to meet the standards of the position, your employment will be terminated effective immediately."
After returning from FMLA leave, Diaz's performance issues continued, and Plaintiff does not materially dispute this. Specifically: [*55]  (i) on his first day back to work following a 20-week medical leave,10 Plaintiff requested a three-week vacation for the stated purpose of settling his father's estate, which, it was later revealed, required only a few days to complete; (ii) he failed to accurately account for his work hours during the week of March 25, 2013, specifically acknowledging that he had unilaterally begun leaving early because he "c[ould]n't take the stress of" traffic and that he considered commuting part of his eight-hour workday (prompting Morrissey to ask if he believed working from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. satisfied his responsibility to the Union); (iii) he failed to directly advise his supervisors of his whereabouts on the morning of April 1, 2013, something he acknowledged was "[his] mistake"; (iv) he was not able to be reached via his Union cell phone, despite indisputably being "on call"; and (v) he failed to perform any Union work between the conclusion of his 7:00 a.m. rehab appointment and his 11:00 a.m. job assignment, despite his obligation to work a full day eight-hour day. Based on this undisputed evidence, summary judgment for the Union is appropriate.
In reaching its conclusion, the Court notes several of Plaintiff's unavailing arguments. Initially, although Plaintiff's Outlook calendar reflects a cardiac rehab appointment on the day at issue, the entry indicates that the appointment would be over, and Plaintiff would be available, at 8:00 a.m. It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not answer his phone at 8:15 a.m. and was not finished at his appointment until almost 9:00 a.m. Nor is there any evidence that he checked in with the Union when it became clear that his appointment ran later than indicated in his Outlook calendar. Thus, even assuming arguendo Plaintiff gave appropriate notice of his appointment, his conduct was nevertheless deficient. And, the Termination Memo reflects Plaintiff's admission that he did not do any Union work between his appointment ending and his 11:00 a.m. scheduled assignment, or after 3:00 p.m. the week before, instead choosing to go home, but claiming [*57]  he worked a full day. Accordingly, the calendar argument does not save Plaintiff's claim.
Plaintiff also argues that Defendant' retaliatory intent is demonstrated by Morrissey's statements during the April 1, 2013 termination meeting, which Plaintiff characterizes as "criticiz[ing] and question[ing] Plaintiff about his FMLA leave." Pl. Memo of Law in Supp. of Mot. for P. Summ. J., DE [48-1], at 8. Plaintiff argues that "[t]he fact that the Union repeatedly reference[d] Plaintiff's FMLA leave amongst its justifications for terminating [Plaintiff] is direct evidence that it was a motivating factor in the decision to terminate." Id. at 9. The Court disagrees. Plaintiff's reliance on selected, out-of-context excerpts from the Termination Memo is an untenable attempt to substantiate a claim where none exists. Indeed, while the Termination Memo indicates that Morrissey referenced Plaintiff's FMLA leave, there is no reasonable basis for interpreting those references as "justifications for" or "criticisms of" Plaintiff's leave. Rather, Morrissey's reference to Plaintiff's absence was intended to provide context for, and perhaps accentuate, Plaintiff's immediate request for a three-week vacation to take care of a family matter that only required [*58]  several days—in other words, Plaintiff was caught being untruthful, which he never denied. This is the basis for Morrissey's remark that Plaintiff's "reasoning is a problem." In any event, the lengthy Termination Memo goes on to articulate multiple bases for the Union's decision to terminate Plaintiff, none of which relates to his FMLA leave.
Finally, the Court notes that Diaz goes to great lengths to undermine the legitimacy of the various performance deficiencies identified by the Union during the first half of 2012. Regardless of whether people may differ as to the question of Diaz's conduct being worthy of termination, there is no reasonable basis to conclude that both final written warnings were to cover up a retaliatory motive, as they predate Diaz's protected activity, i.e., his FMLA leave.
Further, to the extent Plaintiff attempts to rely on positive performance evaluations, see 11/5 Granovsky Decl., Ex, "3", DE [48-4], to create an issue of fact concerning his performance, the Court notes that all but two of the relied-upon evaluations pre-date Diaz's final written warnings, and his 2012 year-end evaluation reflects a diminished rating of 2-out-of-5 in the categories of "[i]s consistently [*59]  organized" and "[i]s consistently timely and sensitive regarding feedback to members/customers," thus undermining his argument.
Against this factual backdrop, the undisputed evidence fails to support a causal relationship between Plaintiff's termination and his medical leave and the Court concludes that no rational jury could find otherwise. Accordingly, with respect to Plaintiff's FMLA claim, I recommend to Judge Feuerstein that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment be denied, and Plaintiff's FMLA claim be dismissed.

B. Plaintiff's ADA Claim
The Union is also entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA claim. "A prima facie case under the ADA requires a plaintiff to establish that: (1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) he had a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he could perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) he suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability." Aka v. Jacob K. Javits Convention Ctr. of N.Y., 09-cv-8195, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114002, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2011) (citing Capobianco v. City of New York, 422 F.3d 47, 56 (2d Cir. 2005)). Here, the parties do not dispute that the Union is subject to the ADA, that Plaintiff was able to perform the essential [*60]  functions of his job, and that he suffered an adverse employment action. The question on the instant motion is whether Plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of the ADA and, if so: (i) whether his disability was a cause of his termination; or (ii) the Union failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation.

1. Whether Plaintiff is Disabled Under the ADA
"The ADA Amendment Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") defines 'disability' as . . . (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of [an] individual. . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Thus, "[f]or a plaintiff to establish that she has a disability under [this subsection], she must '(1) show that [she] suffers from physical impairment, (2) identify the activity claimed to be impaired and establish that it constitutes a major life activity, and (3) show that [her] impairment substantially limits the major life activity previously identified." Morris v. Town of Islip, 12-cv-4984, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133168, at *23 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2014) (quoting Green v. DGG Props. Co., No. 11-cv-1989, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13138, at *25 (D. Conn. Jan. 31, 2013)). As noted, Plaintiff claims that he is disabled, within the meaning of the ADA, because he suffers from ischemic heart disease and "at the time of his discharge, . . . he needed cardiac rehabilitation and was subject to a lifting [*61]  restriction." Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., DE [61], at 5; see Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶¶ 41-42.
a. Impairment
The ADA does not define the term "impairment." Consequently, Plaintiff relies upon the implementing regulations to the ADAAA, 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h)(1), which provide, in pertinent part, that "[p]hysical or mental impairment means . . . [a]ny physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin, and endocrine. . . ." The Court notes that commentary to the federal regulations includes a non-exhaustive list of conditions that constitute a physical impairment, including heart disease. See 45 C.F.R. Part 84, App'x A, SubPt. (A); see also Carper v. TWC Servs., 820 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1351 (S.D. Fl. Oct. 7, 2011) (recognizing "heart disease [as] a qualifying physical impairment. . .").
Pointing specifically to a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease in his medical records, Plaintiff contends that he has established a "physical impairment" within the meaning of the ADAAA. Defendant does not appear to dispute this point. Accordingly, [*62]  the Court finds that Plaintiff's ischemic heart disease is an "impairment" under the ADAAA.
b. Major Life Activity
"'Merely having an impairment does not make one disabled for purposes of the ADA.'" Cody v. County of Nassau, 577 F. Supp. 2d 623, 638 (E.D.N.Y. 2008), aff'd, 345 F. App'x 717 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Sussle v. Sirina Prot. Sys. Corp., 269 F. Supp. 2d 285 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)). More specifically, "heart disease standing alone, is not necessarily a disability." Carper, 820 F. Supp. 2d at 1351. Rather, Plaintiff "must also 'demonstrate that the impairment limits a major life activity.'" Id. (quoting Sussle, 269 F. Supp. 2d at 298).
"Pursuant to the ADAAA, major life activities include, but are not limited to, 'caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.'" Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)). "Major life activities also may include 'the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.'" Id. In this regard, Plaintiff argues simply that "impairment to the function of a single organ or a lifting restriction qualifies as a major life activity." Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for [*63]  Summ. J., DE [61], at 6. This vague argument fails to specifically identify which of Plaintiff's major life activities were allegedly impaired by his heart disease.
To the degree Plaintiff is arguing that the overall "impairment to the function of a single organ" (i.e., his heart) constitutes a per se impairment of a major life activity, his argument fails as a matter of law. Without specifically identifying a particular activity that Plaintiff is restricted in performing, his general heart condition cannot suffice to satisfy his burden. Cf. Carper, 820 F. Supp. 2d at 1352 (granting summary judgment for defendant where the plaintiff alleged that his heart disease caused him to "suffer[] from shortness of breath, dizziness and fatigue, which result[ed] in him being unable to walk for long distances, spend long periods of time in the heat, or climb a ladder," but had failed to "demonstrate[] that these symptoms ha[d] restricted any of his major life activities"); Boitnott v. Corning Inc., 06-cv-330, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59269, at *20-*29 (W.D. Va. June 15, 2010), aff'd, 669 F.3d 172 (4th Cir. 2012) (finding that symptoms associated with heart disease did not affect a major life activity); Reis v. Universal City Dev. Ptnrs, Ltd., 442 F. Supp. 2d 1238, 1246-48 (M.D. Fl. 2006) (congenital heart disease did not impact major life activities). This is particularly true in light of Plaintiff's documented history [*64]  of heart disease, including a previous heart attack, which Plaintiff does not claim ever limited his major life activities prior to the events giving rise to this litigation.
Plaintiff also argues that a "lifting restriction," in and of itself, constitutes a major life activity. The Court questions this premise but acknowledges that other courts have recognized "lifting" as a major life activity. E.g., Marinelli v. City of Erie, 216 F.3d 354, 363 (3d Cir. 2000) (noting that "the EEOC regulations indicate that 'lifting' is a major life activity," but ultimately finding the plaintiff not disabled). Resolving all factual issues in Plaintiff's favor, the Court construes Plaintiff's argument to identify "lifting" (and not a "lifting restriction") as the major life activity allegedly impaired by his heart condition. As a result, the Court is satisfied that this element of the disability test has been met and turns to the third element.
c. Substantially Limiting
While Plaintiff has established an impairment affecting a major life activity, an impairment will only be considered a disability "if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population." Morris, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133168, at *24 (quoting Risco v. McHugh, 868 F. Supp. 2d 75, 108 n.47 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)). In Cody [*65] , the Court noted that the determination of whether an individual is disabled under the ADA is made on "an individualized, case-by-case basis." 577 F. Supp. 2d at 639-40 (citation omitted). Consequently, "[t]o prove that []he suffers from a disability that substantially limits a major life activity, a plaintiff is required to 'do more than merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis or an impairment.' Rather, 'the ADA requires those claiming the Act's protection . . . to prove a disability by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation [caused by the impairment] in terms of their own experience . . . is substantial. As a result, 'a plaintiff cannot prevail on an ADA disability discrimination claim where [he] merely submits evidence that [he] suffers from [an impairment].'" Id. (citations omitted) (emphasis supplied).
In this regard, Diaz argues that "[t]he impact on [him] . . . of lifting an object over 25 pounds, is not experienced by those in the general population." Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., DE [61], at 7. The Court is unpersuaded by this argument, as "numerous courts have held, 'as a matter of law, that the weight limitation similar to that claimed by [P]laintiff is insufficient to establish [*66]  a substantial limitation on one's ability to lift, work, or perform any other major life activity.'" Morris, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133168, at *25-*26 (quoting McDonald v. City of New York, 786 F. Supp. 2d 588, 609 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (collecting cases); see also Marinelli, 216 F.3d at 364 (finding the plaintiff's lifting restriction insufficient to establish a disability as a matter of law, and collecting cases from various Circuit Courts of Appeal holding that restrictions similar to Plaintiff's here are not substantially limiting).
In addition, Plaintiff fails to assert that lifting was a function of his job or that his inability to lift more than 25 pounds impacted his job performance in any way. There is no evidence that he ever lifted anything in connection with his work. Further, the most recent physician's note he submitted to the Union—upon which the Union relied to permit his return to work—did not mention a lifting restriction at all. Accordingly, the Court finds that no rational juror could conclude that Plaintiff was disabled within the meaning of the ADA or that his heart condition or lifting restriction substantially limited any of his major life activities (including and especially his job responsibilities to the Union). Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes as a matter of law that Plaintiff has not established [*67]  a prima facie claim under the ADA and recommends that Defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing that claim be granted.

2. No Evidence of Discriminatory Intent
Even if Plaintiff were able to establish a disability cognizable under the ADAAA sufficient to defeat summary judgment, his discrimination claim under the ADA still fails because there is no evidence that his termination was causally connected to his disability. See Aka, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114002, at *23 (identifying causation as an essential element of ADA discrimination claims (citation omitted)); Mines v. City of New York/DHS, 11-cv-7886, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157782, at *25-*26 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 4, 2013) ("Under the most lenient standard, for a disability discrimination claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that her disability was, in the very least, 'a motivating factor' for the adverse employment action, if not a 'but-for' cause for such an action" (quoting Parker v. Columbia Pictures, Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 336-37 (2d Cir. 2000)).
Assuming arguendo that Plaintiff established a prima facie case, for the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that the Union has satisfied its burden of production under the McDonnell Douglas framework, offering legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Diaz's termination. Thus, to defeat summary judgment, Plaintiff is now required to offer sufficient [*68]  evidence that the proffered reasons are pretext for intentional discrimination on the basis of his disability. See Morse v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 941 F. Supp. 2d 274, 304 (E.D.N.Y. 2013).
In this regard, Plaintiff argues extensively that questions of fact exist with respect to the Union's stated rationale for terminating Plaintiff, see Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., DE [61], at 15-23, claiming inter alia that its proffered reasons are inconsistent or insufficiently severe. However, Plaintiff misapprehends his burden at this stage. As the Supreme Court has instructed, "'it is not enough . . . to disbelieve the employer; the factfinder must believe the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination.'" Reeves, 530 U.S. at 147, 120 S. Ct. 2097 (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 519, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)). Here, as set forth above, the undisputed evidence firmly establishes that all of the progressive disciplinary action taken against Plaintiff, other than his termination, occurred prior to his heart attack, during a time when Plaintiff does not claim he was disabled. And, the only rational conclusion is that the termination decision was based on Diaz's poor performance. Thus, even if Plaintiff succeeds at raising questions as to the rationality of the Union's adverse employment decision, he has failed to offer sufficient [*69]  admissible evidence that the Union's true motives for his termination were rooted in intentional discrimination against him on the basis of his heart condition. Similar to the Court's analysis of Diaz's FMLA claim, of this latter allegation there is simply no material proof.11
Accordingly, the Court respectfully recommends that Defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing Plaintiff's discrimination claim under the ADA also be granted on this alternative ground.

3. Failure to Reasonably Accommodate
The Court's analysis may properly end here because Plaintiff has failed to establish that he is disabled within the meaning of the ADAAA, and also that there exists a triable issue of fact regarding the Union's alleged discrimination of Plaintiff on the basis of a disability. See Cody, 577 F. Supp. 2d at 643 (holding that, because the plaintiff failed to establish that she was disabled, her reasonable accommodation claim failed as a matter of law); see also Morris, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133168, at *33. However, because Plaintiff appears to also argue that the Union failed to reasonably accommodate him, see Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s [*72]  Mot. for Summ. J., DE [61], at 3 & n.1, the Court, in an abundance of caution, addresses this alternative basis for relief. As detailed below, even assuming arguendo that there was sufficient evidence from which Plaintiff could establish that he was disabled within the meaning of the ADAAA, his claim fails because no rational jury could find that the Union failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation.
"Failure to accommodate is a type of disability discrimination that also follows the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting scheme." Campbell v. New York City Tr. Auth., 11-cv-2827, 93 F. Supp. 3d 148, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38714, at *52-*53 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015). "In order to make out a prima facie case for failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must show that (1) she is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA, (2) her employer is a covered entity, (3) the plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job with an accommodation, and (4) the defendant refused to make such an accommodation." Id. at *53 (citing McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 96-97 (2d Cir. 2009)). Only after this standard has been met does the burden shift to the defendant to demonstrate that the employee's proposed accommodation would result in an undue hardship. See Morris, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133168, at *35 (citation and quotation marks omitted).
And, while "'[t]he ADA envisions [*73]  an 'interactive process' by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated,'" EEOC v. Yellow Freight Sys., 98-cv-2270, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16826, at *75-*76 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2002) (quoting Jackan v. New York State DOL, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000)), an employer's participation in that process, though mandatory, is only "triggered by a disabled employee's request for a reasonable accommodation." Id. at *76 (collecting cases).
Here, as indicated, the parties do not dispute that the Union is a covered entity under the ADA and, for purposes of this alternative analysis, the Court assumes arguendo that Plaintiff is a disabled person under the ADA. Thus, the sole question on Plaintiff's prima facie case is whether he required a reasonable accommodation to perform his job and, if so, whether the Union refused to grant one. In this regard, Plaintiff argues that: (i) following his heart attack, he required 36 weeks of cardiac rehab, see Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶¶ 64-73; and (ii) the Union "never engaged in an interactive process to accommodate" him. Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., DE [61], at 3.12
First, Plaintiff identifies seven different occasions on which he and the Union discussed his need for rehabilitation prior to and after returning from medical leave. See Pl. Supp. 56.1 Stmt., DE [63], ¶¶ 64-69, 71. And, the record contains unrefuted testimony that the Union is "very flexible" with field staff members attending to personal business [*75]  during the workday, "as long as they communicate that to" their supervisors. See 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "I" (Caffey Dep.), DE [56-9], at 40:4-13; see also id. at 105:11-16 (stating that Plaintiff having therapy was "not a problem"). These facts preclude a rational factfinder from concluding that the Union failed to participate in an interactive process concerning his cardiac rehab.
Second, Plaintiff's argument fails because there is no evidence that he specifically requested an accommodation to attend cardiac rehabilitation on April 1, 2013, and had the Union refuse. Quite to the contrary, the Union agreed to accommodate Plaintiff's rehabilitation, with one reasonable condition—that he keep his supervisors apprised of his schedule. In fact, on March 7, 2013, Dundon specifically instructed Plaintiff "to let his director know what the schedule for the rehab was," which is consistent with the undisputed fact that field staff members, such as Plaintiff, were required to be "on call" at all times. It is also consistent with Plaintiff's own testimony that if he was "going to be late, leave early, or going to be absent" he would notify his "immediate supervisors." See 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "H" [*76]  (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 165-66. Finally, Dundon's instructions are consistent with the unrefuted testimony, described above, that the Union is flexible with field staff members attending to personal business during the workday, so long as they communicate such matters up the chain of command. Yet, Plaintiff freely admits that he disregarded this singular condition and failed to specifically advise his supervisors that he scheduled a rehabilitation appointment on the morning of April 1, 2013. Therefore, he cannot now be heard to claim that the consequences of doing so constitute a refusal to accommodate him. Cf. 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "I" (Caffey Dep.), DE [56-9], at 162:7-11 ("The problem is that he did not tell [Caffey] where he was. He was supposed to be putting in a full day and he did not return [Caffey's] call and he was going to be late to a place that he was supposed to be at").
Moreover, construing the facts in his favor, the Court notes that Plaintiff's Outlook calendar indicated, and thus the Union was arguably on notice, that Plaintiff would be at rehab from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. on April 1, 2013. And, Diaz testified that, prior to returning from leave, he advised Dundon he would [*77]  only require "an hour" for cardiac rehabilitation three times per week. Consistent with his calendar entry, the Union did not attempt to contact Plaintiff until 8:15 a.m. that morning and Plaintiff concedes that he did not become available until almost 9:00 a.m. Further, there is no evidence that when the rehabilitation appointment ran late, Diaz checked in with the Union to see whether he missed anything as a result. Then, on his own, Plaintiff decided not to do any Union work between his rehabilitation appointment ending and his 11:00 a.m. assignment beginning. Such conduct is consistent with Diaz's behavior the previous week, during which he only performed his assigned intermittent duties, totaling four-hour workdays. Thus, Plaintiff's argument fails because he received the benefit of the very accommodation he requested—namely, permission to attend rehabilitation uninterrupted from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. The Court finds it unreasonable under the circumstances to conclude that Plaintiff, even assumedly disabled, was entitled to come and go as he pleased, and only work a four-hour day, without adequately advising his supervisors. Rather, the undisputed evidence shows that Plaintiff was [*78]  reasonably accommodated by being returned to his same position, salary, and benefits after a full 20 weeks of medical leave, and then being explicitly granted permission to attend 36 weeks of rehab on the condition that he advise his supervisors of his appointment schedule—this condition is objectively reasonable in the Court's view, as Plaintiff's heart attack cannot serve to excuse him altogether from operating within the professional and administrative confines of the workplace.
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the Union did not fail to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff. Accordingly, the Court recommends that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted and Plaintiff's ADA claim be dismissed.

C. Plaintiff's Title VII Claim
Similarly, Plaintiff's Title VII claim is untenable as a matter of law. "In order to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position in question; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) 'the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.'" Moore [*79]  v. Kingsbrook Jewish Med. Ctr., 11-cv-3625, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107111, at *17-*18 (E.D.N.Y. July 30, 2013) (quoting Brown v. City of Syracuse, 673 F.3d 141, 150 (2d Cir. 2012)). The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff was a member of a protected class, that he was qualified for his position with the Union, or that he suffered an adverse employment action. Rather, the question presented on the instant motion is whether the circumstances of Plaintiff's termination permit an inference of discriminatory intent and, if so, whether Defendant's claimed legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Plaintiff's termination were pretextual, sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The Court answers this question in the negative.

1. Alleged Discriminatory Remarks
In this regard, Plaintiff claims that several remarks by Caffey, Vetrano, and Durso evince discriminatory intent. In analyzing those claims, the Court is guided by the following legal principles.
a. Applicable Law
In determining whether remarks constitute evidence of discriminatory intent, the Court is instructed to consider four factors: "(1) who made the remark (i.e., a decision-maker, a supervisor, or a low-level co-worker); (2) when the remark was made in relation to the employment decision at issue; (3) the content of the remark (i.e., whether a reasonable [*80]  juror could view the remark as discriminatory); and (4) the context in which the remark was made (i.e., whether it was related to the decision-making process)." Dudley v. New York City Hous. Auth., 12-cv-2771, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140052, at *60 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2014)). With regard to the final factor, the analysis is informed by a plaintiff's own testimony about the context of an allegedly offensive remark which, under certain circumstances, may operate to "preclude[] any interpretation of it as discriminatory." Shepherd v. BCBG Max Azria Grp., Inc., 11-cv-7634, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146772, at *58 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2012); Sicular v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Homeless Servs., 09-cv-0981, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10089, at *71-*72 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2010) (Report and Recommendation), adopted by, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53064 (S.D.N.Y. May 28, 2010), aff'd, 455 F. App'x 129 (2d Cir. 2012) (holding that the plaintiff's own testimony that he felt remarks were not malicious, he responded by making jokes, and the remarks did not affect his work environment prevented remarks from rising to level of actionable conduct); O'Neill-Marino v. Omni Hotels Mgmt. Corp., 99-cv-3793, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2138, at *22-*23 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2001) (plaintiff who "attempt[ed] to cast a sinister light" on prior conversations by "pull[ing] out several soundbytes to suit her purposes" failed to rebut non-discriminatory reasons for adverse employment actions because "when those statements [we]re viewed in context, one cannot reasonably conclude that" the speaker was [*81]  intentionally discriminating).
Moreover, verbal comments can constitute evidence of discriminatory intent only "if the plaintiff can establish a nexus between the alleged discriminatory remarks and the defendant's decision to terminate the plaintiff's employment." Dasrath v. Stony Brook Univ. Med. Ctr., 12-cv-1484(SJF)(SIL), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32805, at *31-*32 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 17, 2015) (quoting Del Franco v. New York City Off-Track Betting Corp., 429 F.

Grp., Inc., 478 F.3d 111, 115 (2d Cir. 2006) ("[R]emarks made by someone other than the person who made the decision adversely affecting the plaintiff may have little tendency to show that the decision-maker was motivated by the discriminatory sentiment expressed in the [*82]  remark" (citation omitted)); Gueye v.

App'x 70 (2d Cir. 2008) ("As an initial matter, that a co-worker who was not in a supervisory relationship vis-à-vis [Plaintiff] and had no role in firing him [made an allegedly racist remark] does not suggest that [Plainitff's] . . . termination [was] made with discriminatory intent"); Opoku-Acheampong v. Depository Trust Co., 99-cv-0774, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16387, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2005) ("[S]tray comments are not evidence of discrimination if they are not temporally linked to an adverse employment action"). In addition, where allegedly discriminatory remarks are not directed at the plaintiff, they have "weaken[ed]" probative value. Sicular, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10089, at *72 n.27 (collecting cases).
Finally, "[i]t is well settled that conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation [are in]sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether . . . discriminatory animus played a role in an adverse employment action." Wright v. City of Ithaca, 12-cv-378, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34791, at *21 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2015) (citations omitted); see Patterson v. Newspaper & Mail Deliverers' Union of N.Y. & Vicinity, 73-cv-3058, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37538, at *49 (S.D.N.Y. July 13, 2005) ("A party's own self-serving conclusory statements cannot sustain a Title VII claim of discrimination"); Meiri v. Dacon, 759 F.2d 989, 998 (2d Cir. 1985) ("To allow a party to defeat a motion for summary judgment by offering purely conclusory [*83]  allegations of discrimination, absent any concrete particulars, would necessitate a trial in all Title VII cases"). Where a plaintiff "offer[s] nothing more than mere innuendo that his race must have played a role" in his termination decision, "and points to no evidence from which a rational jury could reasonably conclude that [D]efendants' stated reasons were pretextual," summary judgment for Defendant is appropriate. See Wright, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34791, at *21-*22; cf. Regis v. Metro. Jewish Geriatric Ctr., 97-cv-906, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2215, at *27-*28 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 11, 2000) (finding allegations to be "convenient and belated afterthought[s]", rather than legitimate instances of intentional employment discrimination).
b. Application
Here, these principals require judgment in favor of the Union as a matter of law. As set forth more fully below, the Court finds that the subject remarks, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, do not permit an inference of discriminatory intent.
Director Ray Vetrano: The only evidence that Vetrano made allegedly discriminatory remarks comes from Plaintiff's testimony that Vetrano used the word "spic" and stated that Puerto Ricans carry switchblades. Diaz cannot recall even the vaguest of details relating to the dates or context of these alleged remarks. His only testimony [*84]  is that the word "spic" was used yearly. See 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "25" (Pl. Dep.), DE [64-27], at 381. Significantly, Plaintiff admits he never reported these remarks to anyone within the Union or elsewhere. In an effort to bolster these alleged statements, Diaz points to the minutes of a meeting that occurred after Plaintiff's termination, wherein another employee accused Vetrano of making a derogatory comment. There is no evidence that the remarks were close in time to the decision to terminate Plaintiff, that Vetrano was involved in the termination decision in any way, or that Morrissey, i.e., the decisionmaker, heard or learned about any of the remarks Vetrano allegedly made. The Court finds that the evidence concerning Vetrano constitutes stray remarks insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact in this regard.
Director Jack Caffey: The Court reaches a similar conclusion with respect to Caffey, who admitted to using the word "spic" generally, and specifically in reference to Plaintiff. By Diaz's own admission, however, he and Caffey were close friends who spent considerable time outside of work socializing. Plaintiff testified to thinking of Caffey as a "brother." Such [*85]  facts are consistent with Caffey's largely unrefuted testimony that such coarse language was not discriminatory, but instead was used in jest, that Plaintiff also jokingly used pejorative phrases such as "guinea bastard" in relation to Caffey's Italian ancestry, which Diaz does not deny, and that when Caffey made such remarks he was not in a supervisory role vis-à-vis Plaintiff. Furthermore, Plaintiff's own reference to such banter as "cruel humor" and his statement that "men are men sometimes, they say things. It[] stays between us" vitiates his argument that these statements support an actionable claim.
In addition, as with Vetrano, there is no evidence that Caffey was a decisionmaker with respect to Plaintiff's termination. In this regard, the Court notes that Morrissey admits speaking with Caffey on April 1, 2013 with respect to Plaintiff's actions that morning, see Morrissey Decl. ¶ 20, and Plaintiff argues that Caffey's alleged discriminatory intent unlawfully influenced Morrissey. See Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., DE [61], at 11-12.13 Morrissey also stated that he asked Caffey to "find out what work [Plaintiff] had been doing during the prior week, and to [*86]  report back to [him]." Id. ¶ 21. However, there is no evidence that remarks allegedly attributable to Caffey, made at indeterminate times prior to Caffey becoming a supervisor, whenever that was, influenced Morrissey's decision to terminate Plaintiff, or that Morrissey relied on any recommendation from Caffey regarding the decision to terminate Diaz. In fact, the only evidence is that Morrissey went into the April 1, 2013 meeting undecided about the outcome. See 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "I" (Caffey Dep.), DE [56-9], at 283-84. Consistent with that fact, Caffey testified that Morrissey wanted to give Plaintiff a chance to "give his side of the story" before ultimately making a decision. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 219. This is also consistent with Durso's undisputed testimony relating to the Union's procedure for such meetings—namely, that Morrissey has discretion, based on what occurs at the meeting, to effectuate the termination. See 12/1 Chun Decl., Ex. "J" (Durso Dep.), DE [56-10], at 203-04.
Furthermore, the Termination Memo indicates, and is not contradicted by Diaz, that Morrissey provided Plaintiff with ample opportunity to defend his performance, specifically asking: (i) whether he informed his supervisors of his rehabilitation appointment on April 1, 2013 (Plaintiff admitted that he had not and that the failure to do so was his "mistake"); (ii) whether he had worked past 3:00 p.m. during the prior week (Plaintiff admitted that he unilaterally decided to go home at 3:00 p.m. to avoid traffic); (iii) whether he considered commuting part of his workday (Plaintiff admitted that he did, despite there being no rational basis for this conclusion); and (iv) whether he was performing Union work between his rehab session and his 11:00 a.m. job assignment (Plaintiff admitted he "didn't do anything for" the Union during that time). Accordingly, the Court finds it unreasonable to impute the sentiment behind Caffey's alleged discriminatory remarks to [*88]  Morrissey's decision-making process, particularly in light of the undisputed evidence that Morrissey had substantial non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Plaintiff.
President John Durso: The only evidence concerning Durso is Plaintiff's testimonial account (which Durso does not dispute) that during a staff meeting, he stated "there are only two kinds of people, Italians, and people who want to be Italian." Plaintiff also claims that Durso stated "What do you know, you're not Italian?" but does not allege that the comment was directed at him, and could not recall the timing in relation to his termination, or the context of that statement.
And, while it is undisputed that Durso "approved" of Morrissey's decision to terminate Plaintiff, there is no evidence that such approval involved more than simply conferring discretion upon Morrissey to make the termination decision following a meeting with Plaintiff. Under the circumstances, the Court finds that no rational juror could construe Durso's remarks as evincing discriminatory animus and, even assuming otherwise, there is simply no evidence that the sentiment behind such remarks influenced Morrissey's decision in any way. For all of [*89]  these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's vague recollection of stray remarks, which cannot be imputed to Morrissey's decision to terminate him, are insufficient to defeat summary judgment with regard to Diaz's Title VII national origin/ethnicity discrimination claims.

2. Disparate Treatment
Plaintiff's remaining allegations—a hodge-podge of conclusory claims relating to the Union's treatment of minorities—also fail to create an issue of fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment.
a. Plaintiff's Purported Statistical Analysis
As an initial matter, "the disparate treatment of certain classes within a small group is insufficient, without more, to establish actionable discriminatory animus." See Janneh v. Regal Ent'm Grp., 07-cv-79, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81032, at *41-*42 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 2009) (finding that "the under representation of blacks and minorities in [managerial] positions does not provide sufficient evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that considerations of Plaintiffs race or national origin motivated the nonpromotion decisions in issue"). And, courts have routinely held comparable sample sizes to that utilized here too small to support a disparate treatment claim. See, e.g., Mayor of Phila. v. Educ. Equal. League, 415 U.S. 605, 620-21, 94 S. Ct. 1323, 39 L. Ed. 2d 630 (1974) (affirming trial court's rejection [*90]  of statistical data as "meaningless" and "too fragmentary and speculative to support a serious charge in a judicial proceeding" based on, inter alia, "the smallness of the sample presented by the 13-member Panel" and the inherent "flaw[s] in straight percentage comparisons"); Kemp v. A&J Produce Corp., 00-cv-6050, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45731, at *24-*25 (E.D.N.Y. June 7, 2005), aff'd, 164 F. App'x 12 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding statistics "meaningless" and "preclud[ing] reliance on any perceived statistical imbalance" where employer's personnel records showed that in two sequential years 4-out-of-8 and 5-out-of-9 terminated employees were black); Murphy v. Bd. of Educ., 273 F. Supp. 2d 292, 303 (W.D.N.Y. 2003) (finding it "absurd" and "probative of nothing whatsoever" for plaintiff to perform comparison of nationwide study with a sampling of fifteen teachers identified from an outdated yearbook); Coleman v. Prudential Relocation, 975 F. Supp. 234, 240 (W.D.N.Y. 1997) (collecting cases for proposition that a "small sample size renders . . . statistical evidence practically meaningless").
Applying these standards, Plaintiff's purported statistical analysis does not convey information sufficient to defeat summary judgment. First, the data sample here, between approximately 11 and 14 employees, is too small to permit a meaningful statistical analysis.
Further, as noted, Plaintiff's claims that "[e]very single upper level Union employee is Caucasian" [*91]  and that Plaintiff "was supervised solely by Caucasians" are unsupported by facts in the record. However, even construing this assertion in Plaintiff's favor, the Court does not find it probative of any material fact in this case. This is not a "failure to promote" case and the Court is unwilling under these circumstances to infer strictly from the racial makeup of the Plaintiff's chain-of-command, without any other related fact, that Diaz's placement within the system, and subsequent termination for performance, is a result of racial animus.
Third, Plaintiff's reliance upon a series of 11 "warnings" issued by the Union—some of which date back to 2004—is misplaced. As noted, Plaintiff draws superficial conclusions about these data without regard for the circumstances surrounding any of the underlying incidents or the nature of the conduct giving rise to the disciplinary action. However, even if Plaintiff is correct that the sampling of "warnings" reveals that a majority of those warned were non-white, the analogy fails in light of the totality of record evidence. In fact, many of the warnings give no indication of the subject's position within the Union, the race of the subject (other [*92]  than what ill-informed inferences can be drawn from the subject's name), the disciplinary history of the subject, or the conduct that gave rise to the warning.14 Such evidence fails to satisfy the Second Circuit's explicit requirement that comparative information must be judged on acts of "comparable seriousness." Graham v. Long Island R.R., 230 F.3d 34, 40 (2d Cir. 2000).
An examination of the warnings reveals that some fail altogether to specify the circumstances underpinning them and, of those that do, the covered misconduct falls along a broad spectrum. For example, a November 30, 2010 warning to Rey Rosado states merely that the employee "failed to meet the minimum expectation of [the Union's] performance standards in multiple categories and [his] overall score [wa]s below the Union standard." Similarly, a July 21, 2008 warning to Yomaira Franqui, an employee in the Union's Call Center, states that she was not complying with her Union probationary period and that "immediate improvement in [her] attendance [*93]  [was] expected." A July 27, 2004 warning to Jose Pena involved allegations that he made threatening remarks to a co-worker and demonstrated a pattern of behavior that indicated anger-management issues. Clearly, despite Plaintiff's attempt to deduce probative trends from these warnings, they are not sufficiently analogous to raise an issue of fact here. And, this lack of comparability must be considered in light of the fact that some of the warnings pre-date Plaintiff's termination by nine years. In fact, it is difficult to understand how any trend in discipline can be drawn where it appears from Plaintiff's evidence that, on average, the Union only disciplines its employees at the rate of one per year.
Finally, the same is true for Plaintiff's reliance upon an unidentified three-page document purporting to show the Union's demographics during Plaintiff's employment. Initially, Plaintiff neither alleges nor establishes the reliability, completeness, or accuracy of the information captured in the document or the methods by which it was collected. The document explicitly states that it reflects "General Fund employees only and does not include employees of the Health & Welfare Fund."  [*94] See 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "35", DE [64-37]. Plaintiff does not address this fact, which goes directly to the probative value of the document. In addition, Plaintiff does not claim—and the document does not state—the larger volume from which it was extracted, or even the precise time period it covers, other than "during Diaz's employment." Id. Nevertheless, from this document alone, Plaintiff concludes that of the fourteen Union employees terminated for performance since 2005, seven were Hispanic. The Court finds this statistic insufficient to defeat summary judgment.
In light of the totality of record evidence, it is clear that Plaintiff cherry-picked this limited sampling of demographic information because, without context, it can be manipulated to yield a seemingly helpful statistic. For instance, the undisputed evidence also demonstrates that, with one exception, every Union employee holding the same title as Diaz ("Organizer") is Hispanic. See Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶¶ 70-71. Yet Plaintiff offers no principled reason not to extract from that data the equally true statistic that the Union hires Hispanics at a disproportionately higher rate than Caucasians—a conclusion that undermines [*95]  his entire argument. The Court finds Plaintiff's purported statistical analysis unavailing, particularly in light of its insufficient sample size, its failure to reflect information pertaining to all Union employees, and the lack of any corroborative evidence.
b. Differential Treatment for Italian-Americans
Plaintiff also alleges that Italian-American employees received preference to the detriment of minorities. See Am. Compl., DE [34], ¶ 15. In support of this contention, Plaintiff points only to the remarks allegedly attributable to Durso that "there are only two kinds of people, Italians, and people who want to be Italian" and "[w]hat do you know, you're not Italian?" As noted above, these alleged remarks, the timing and context of which Plaintiff cannot recall, and which Plaintiff concedes were not directed at him, are insufficient to raise an issue of fact regarding the basis for Plaintiff's termination. This is particularly so in light of the fact that there is no record evidence connecting those remarks, temporally or otherwise, to the termination.
Furthermore, Defendant presents so-called "comparator evidence" in this regard that Plaintiff fails to substantially rebut. "One form of [*96]  circumstantial evidence probative of discrimination is evidence 'showing that the employer subjected [the plaintiff] to disparate treatment, that is, treated him less favorably than a similarly situated employee outside his protected group." Holleman v. Art Crating Inc., 12-cv-2719, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139916, at *96 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2014) (quoting Graham, 230 F.3d at 39). Comparators "'must have a situation sufficiently similar to plaintiff's to support at least a minimal inference that the difference of treatment may be attributable to discrimination.'" Viruet, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15045, at *72 (quoting McGuinness v. Lincoln Hall, 263 F.3d 49, 54 (2d Cir. 2001)). This requires similarity in "all material respects," involving consideration of whether Plaintiff and the proposed comparator "were subject to the same workplace standards" and "whether the conduct for which the employer imposed discipline was of comparable seriousness." Holleman, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139916, at *96 (quoting Graham, 230 F.3d at 39). The standard for comparing conduct requires a "reasonably close resemblance of the facts and circumstances" of Plaintiff's and the comparator's cases, "rather than a showing that both cases are identical." Id. (quoting Ruiz, 609 F.3d at 494). It bears emphasizing that the "disparate treatment" theory is a method of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, see McGuinness, 263 F.3d at 53, and the burden of establishing the comparison lies with Plaintiff.
 [*97] Defendant suggests that Guy James, a former Union employee that the parties agree is Italian-American, was terminated under circumstances sufficiently similar to defeat Plaintiff's differential treatment claim as a matter of law. See, e.g., Def. 56.1 Stmt., DE [55], ¶ 271; Def. Supp. 56.1 Resp., DE [68], ¶¶ 59-62. Particularly in the absence of an alternative proposed comparator from Plaintiff, the Court finds the James comparison to be further proof militating against finding that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case. This evidence demonstrates that James, like Plaintiff, was asked to a meeting with Morrissey and Dundon, at which James, like Plaintiff, was suspected of lying about the amount of time he was working. See 12/29 Granovsky Decl., Ex. "16" (Conversation Recap—Guy James Resignation), DE [64-16]. Morrissey confronted James, as he did Plaintiff, about inaccurate record-keeping and related misconduct. See id. Finally, the Union offered James, as it had Plaintiff, a choice to accept an enhanced severance package and neutral letter of reference or be terminated for cause. See id.
Plaintiff's attempts at distinguishing James as a comparator are unavailing. Initially, James's role as a supervisor does not defeat the comparison. If anything, that James, an Italian-American supervisor, was treated virtually identically to Plaintiff, an Hispanic non-supervisor, weighs against a finding that Plaintiff was treated unfairly; to the contrary, it is suggestive of the Union's standard policy for handling such matters, from which it did not deviate when dealing with Plaintiff. Also, Diaz's claim that the Union undertook an "extensive" investigation of the allegations against James is without factual support. There is no evidence beyond the internal memo recapping the meeting at which James resigned to support this accusation. The contents of that memo fail to reveal an extensive investigation, the benefit of which Plaintiff did not receive. Rather, the memo reveals only that James's EZ Pass records were the [*98]  primary method by which the Union uncovered his infractions. Thus, the Union's investigation of and reliance upon those records was necessary. Here, such records were unnecessary because Plaintiff's supervisors and co-workers provided direct, albeit anecdotal, evidence of the misconduct that finally precipitated his termination, some of which Plaintiff admits, such as requesting a three-week vacation to Puerto Rico to handle a few days' worth of business, and working four-hour days during the week of March 25, 2013 because he felt that his commute should count as work time. In any event, as noted above, the cases need not be identical for an effective comparison. Rather, the analysis considers whether Plaintiff and James were subject to the same workplace standards and whether the conduct for which James was terminated was of comparable seriousness to Plaintiff's. As described above, both prongs are satisfied here.
In fact, the only appreciable difference between Plaintiff and James is that James took the option to resign with an enhanced severance, whereas the Termination Memo indicates that Plaintiff lashed out when presented with the same option, stating, among other things, "You [*99]  can keep your package[,] You can speak to my attorney" and "You are evil; you have ruined the 338 family, do you know what people say about you, you are ugly." Plaintiff may not now be heard to use that difference as the very basis for disqualifying James as a comparator. Rather, to the degree Plaintiff was treated differently than James at all, it appears to have been purely a result of Plaintiff's own doing; at a minimum, there is no evidence of any racially-motivated discrimination. Moreover, the documentation indicates that even after making his defiant remarks, the Union agreed to extend Plaintiff's time to accept an enhanced severance package with a neutral letter of reference from the Union for 48 hours.
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to his Title VII disparate treatment claim. Accordingly, the Court recommends that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted and Plaintiff's Title VII claim be dismissed.

D. Plaintiff's NYSHRL and NYCHRL Claims
Next, the Court recommends that Judge Feuerstein dismiss Plaintiff's NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims as well. An independent analysis of these causes of action must be conducted [*100]  because Diaz specifically and independently invokes the Court's diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, in addition to its federal question jurisdiction. See Talwar v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 14-cv-1520, 610 Fed. Appx. 28, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7455, at *6-*8 (2d Cir. May 6, 2015). Because Plaintiff is a resident of New Jersey and Defendant maintains its principal place of business in New York, see Am. Compl., DE [34], ¶¶ 8-9; Ans. to Am. Compl., DE [37], ¶¶ 8-9, the Court has original jurisdiction over these claims.15

1. Diaz's State and City Law Ethnicity/National Origin Discrimination Claims
a. Ethnicity/National Original Discrimination under the NYSHRL
With respect to Diaz's state law ethnicity/national origin claims, the Court notes that "'[e]mployment discrimination claims brought under the NYSHRL are analyzed identically to claims under . . . Title VII,' and thus the outcome of [Diaz]'s NYSHRL discrimination claims must necessarily be the same as the outcome of h[is] Title VII claims." Talwar, 610 Fed. Appx. 28, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7455, at *7 (quoting Brennan v. Metro. Opera Ass'n, Inc., 192 F.3d 310, 316 n.2 (2d Cir. 1999)). [*101]  Accordingly, for the reasons the Court recommends granting the Union's motion for summary judgment dismissing Plaintiff's Title VII ethnicity/national origin claims, "the same result is dictated as a matter of law for h[is] state law [NYSHRL] claim[]," id., and this claim should be dismissed as well.
b. Ethnicity/National Original Discrimination under the NYCHRL
Diaz's NYCHRL ethnicity/national origin claim "cannot be resolved in the same way, since 'courts must analyze NYCHRL claims separately and independently from any federal and state law claims,' and 'even if the challenged conduct is not actionable under federal and state law, federal courts must consider separately whether it is actionable under the broader New York City standards.'" Talwar, 610 Fed. Appx. 28, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7455, at *7-*8 (quoting Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 109).
Under § 8-107(1)(a) of the New York City Administrative Code, "[i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice . . . [f]or an employer . . . because of the actual or perceived . . . race, creed, color, national origin, . . . alienage or citizenship status of any person, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment such person or to discriminate against such person in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment." N.Y.C. [*102]  Admin. Code § 8-107((1)(a). In 2005, the New York City Council amended the NYCHRL through passage of the Local Civil Rights Restoration Act of 2005, N.Y.C. Local Law No. 85 (2005) (the "Restoration Act").16 The Restoration Act "clarif[ied] the scope of New York City's Human Rights Law," by underscoring the intended liberal construction to be given its provisions. Restoration Act §§ 1, 7.
Discrimination claims under the NYCHRL, like their state and federal counterparts, are analyzed using the McDonnell Douglas framework." Varughese, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43758, at *102 (citations omitted) ("Discrimination claims brought under Title VII, § 1981, the [NYSHRL], and [NYCHRL] all are analyzed under the burden-shifting framework that the Supreme Court established in" McDonnell Douglas); see also Batchelor v. City of New York, 11-cv-2058, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46921, at *49 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2014), adopted in relevant part, 12 F. Supp. 3d 458, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45800 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2014) (noting that the "separate analysis" required under the NYCHRL "may utilize any theory, including the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework"). But, the statute's "uniquely broad and remedial purpose requires courts to construe [it] 'broadly in favor of discrimination plaintiffs, to the extent [*103]  that such a construction is reasonably possible.'" Varughese, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43758, at *103-*104 (quoting Albunio v. City of New York, 16 N.Y.3d 472, 477-78, 947 N.E.2d 135, 922 N.Y.S.2d 244 (2011)).
The Court's obligation to apply the McDonnell Douglas standard more leniently to Plaintiff's NYCHRL claim results in two primary distinctions: "First, to make out a prima facie case under state or federal law, the plaintiff must submit proof that she 'endure[d] a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of her employment.'" Id. at *104 (quoting Galabya v. NYC Bd. of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir. 2000)). "By contrast, the NYCHRL does not require that the offending employment action be 'materially adverse.'" Id. (citations omitted). As applied here, this distinction makes no difference, as Plaintiff's termination would inarguably satisfy the definition of an adverse employment action under the federal and state statutes, and does so here.
"Second, the NYCHRL places a burden with the defendant that rests with the plaintiff under state and federal law." Id. at *105. Specifically, "[u]nder state and federal law, a plaintiff may pursue a 'mixed-motive' theory that discriminatory animus was 'a motivating factor' in the adverse action, rather that its but-for cause." Id. (citation omitted). "Under that . . . regime, a plaintiff could obtain declaratory relief, attorney's fees and costs, and some forms of [*104]  injunctive relief based solely on proof that race, color, . . . or nationality was a motivating factor in the employment action; but the employer's proof that it would still have taken the employment action would save it from monetary damages and a reinstatement order." Univ. of Tex. Southwestern Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2526, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013) (citing Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., 557 U.S. 167, 178 n.5, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009)). "Under the NYCHRL, however, it is not plaintiffs who must show their proof deserves a mixed-motive analysis, but defendants who must show that the proof precludes mixed motive liability." Varughese, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43758, at *106. In other words, "[c]laims under the NYCHRL should be dismissed at the summary judgment stage 'only if the defendant demonstrates that it is entitled to summary judgment under both' the McDonnell Douglas analysis and also the 'mixed motive' analysis." Id. at *106 (quoting Melman v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., 98 A.D.3d 107, 113, 946 N.Y.S.2d 27 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dep't 2012) (emphasis in original)); see Batchelor, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46921, at *49 ("[A] defendant, on a motion for summary judgment, bears the burden of showing that, based on the evidence before the court and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor, no jury could find defendant liable under any of the evidentiary routes" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).
As noted above, however, notwithstanding the deferential lens through which NYCHRL claims must be viewed, the same evidentiary pillars [*105]  undergirding the McDonnell Douglas framework as it relates to federal and state discrimination claims, also provide the analytical framework required here. See Varughese, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43758, at *106-*107 (noting that "the state courts have cautioned that 'the NYCHRL does not alter the kind, quality, or nature of evidence that is necessary to support or defeat a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56'" (quoting Lytle v. JPMorgan Chase, 08-cv-9503, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15599, at *62 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2012) (Report and Recommendation), adopted by 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46240 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2012), aff'd, 518 F. App'x 49 (2d Cir. 2013)). Significantly, similar to federal and state discrimination claims, "'a plaintiff must still link the adverse employment action to a discriminatory motivation' to withstand summary judgment on h[is] NYCHRL claim.'" Id. at *107 (quoting Sotomayor v. City of New York, 862 F. Supp. 2d 226, 258 (E.D.N.Y. 2012), aff'd, 713 F.3d 163 (2d Cir. 2013)). In that regard, "'the burden of persuasion of the ultimate issue of discrimination always remains with the plaintiff.'" Id. at *107 (quoting Stephenson v. Hotel Emples. & Rest. Emples. Union Local 100 of AFL-CIO, 6 N.Y.3d 265, 271, 844 N.E.2d 1155, 811 N.Y.S.2d 633 (2006)); see Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 113 ("[T]he NYCHRL is not a general civility code and a defendant is not liable if the plaintiff fails to prove the conduct is caused at least in part by discriminatory or retaliatory motives, or if the defendant proves the conduct was nothing more than 'petty slights or trivial inconveniences'" (internal citations omitted)).
Applying these standards, the Court concludes that summary [*106]  judgment for the Union is required with respect to Diaz's ethnicity/national origin claim under the NYCHRL. Specifically, the Union has satisfied its burden of establishing that discriminatory animus played no role in its decision to terminate Diaz, thereby defeating Plaintiff's prima facie case. Rather, the only evidence presented in this regard is a series of stray remarks, critical details about which, including their timing and context, Diaz could not remember. In addition, there is no evidence that Morrissey, the individual with sole decision-making authority vis-à-vis Plaintiff's termination, ever made such a remark, knew about any such remarks, or was influenced with respect to his decision by those alleged to have made such remarks.
Moreover, even assuming arguendo that Diaz satisfied his burden of establishing a prima facie case under the NYCHRL's more lenient standard, "the kind, quality, or nature of evidence that is necessary to" overcome the Union's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision to terminate Plaintiff remain unaltered. See Varughese, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43758, at *106-*107 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Thus, because the record is devoid of evidence upon which a jury could find an inference [*107]  of intentional discrimination based on Diaz's ethnicity or national origin, his NYCHRL claim fails for the same reasons his federal and state law discrimination claims fail. Specifically, the record establishes that Diaz had a well-documented history of poor performance with the Union, which culminated upon his return from FMLA leave when he, inter alia: requested a three-week vacation to attend to family business that only required a few days to complete; failed to directly advise his supervisors of his rehabilitation appointment, which he concedes was his "mistake"; was inaccessible via his Union cell phone after his cardiac rehabilitation appointment ended, despite being "on call"; and unilaterally decided to work less than the 35 hours per week required of him because, inter alia, he considered commuting "work time." Moreover, the Union presents compelling comparator evidence, which Diaz fails to materially rebut, indicating that Caucasian employees, and Italian-Americans in particular, received no better treatment than Plaintiff under similar circumstances. Plaintiff's bare denials, conclusory and superficial statistical analyses, and unsubstantiated post hoc accounts of minority [*108]  mistreatment within the Union are insufficient to raise an issue of fact, even under the NYCHRL's more lenient standard, sufficient to defeat summary judgment.
In reaching this conclusion, the Court notes that Plaintiff's reliance upon Bennett v. Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc., 92 A.D.3d 29, 936 N.Y.S.2d 112 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dep't 2011), is misplaced. Diaz contends that this case stands principally for the proposition that "evidence of pretext should in almost every case indicate to the court that a motion for summary judgment must be denied." See Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., DE [61], at 23 (quoting Bennett, 92 A.D.3d at 44). Diaz suggests that Bennett requires a jury to determine whether pretext evidence sufficiently establishes discrimination. Id. at 24 (citing Bennett, 92 A.D.3d at 43). The Court disagrees. While the court in Bennett recognized a "host of determinations properly made only by a jury" that come into play "[o]nce there is some evidence that at least one of the reasons proffered by [the employer] is false, misleading, or incomplete," it nevertheless affirmed summary judgment in favor of the employer, holding that the plaintiff's evidence of discrimination was insufficient under the NYCHRL. See Bennett, 92 A.D.3d at 43-46. Specifically, the court held that:
Defendant put forward evidence of nondiscriminatory motivation, specifically, [*109]  credible evidence of numerous reports of plaintiff's unsatisfactory work performance, including, but not limited to, plaintiff's poor attendance and lack of job focus, and plaintiff's own admission that he was unable to 'master [his] job.' Even after plaintiff was given a week's vacation and an additional three-week leave to compose himself, his work performance continued to be below expectations. Relatedly, the Director of DPO advised plaintiff that if his work did not improve, he would be terminated. There is also undisputed evidence that plaintiff frequently slept on the job, and that he had left his shift early on several occasions without explanation. These allegations were corroborated by the affidavits of plaintiff's coworkers, who stated that plaintiff was found asleep under the desk of his cubicle, that he was under the influence of alcohol, and that he was unable to handle his responsibilities.
Id. at 46. The court concluded that this evidence, together with the plaintiff's failure to "produce any evidence that there were black coworkers who were similarly situated to plaintiff in terms of poor performance or nonperformance, let alone evidence that a similarly situated black coworker [*110]  was treated more leniently," id. at 46, required summary judgment in favor of the employer.
The Court finds Bennett factually analogous and unworthy of compelling a different result here. Specifically, like the employer in Bennett, the Union put forth credible evidence of Diaz's poor work performance, including two final written warnings which, like in Bennett, advised Diaz that if his performance did not improve, he would be terminated. Diaz also admitted, similar to the plaintiff if Bennett, that he was "slowing down," and it was "[b]ecoming more and more hard[] for [him] to sometimes get up in the morning or with the changing of the shifts, it was becoming difficult." 12/1 Chun Decl. at Ex "H" (Pl. Dep.), DE [56-8], at 216-17. It is undisputed that these circumstances, together with Diaz's admittedly severe stress and propensity to sleep in his car, contributed to his demotion from Union Representative. Furthermore, like the plaintiff in Bennett, Diaz took a lengthy 20-week separation from work (albeit, for medical and not personal reasons), but his work performance continued to be below expectations upon his return. This poor performance included, as it had in Bennett, leaving work early without [*111]  adequate explanation and corroborative evidence that Diaz was unable to handle his responsibilities. Based on the factual symmetry between these cases, the Court is unpersuaded by Plaintiff's argument that Bennett militates against resolution of the instant case on summary judgment. This is particularly so in light of Plaintiff's failure—similar to the failure of the plaintiff in Bennett—to present any comparator evidence at all, let alone sufficient evidence to overcome the Union's proof.
The Court further notes that Bennett has been cited by more recent binding authority, not for the proposition suggested by Diaz, but for the principles that: "Although the [New York State Appellate Division,] First Department has observed that a jury is often best suited to [evaluate the totality of the circumstances in a particular case], . . . summary judgment still can be an appropriate mechanism for resolving NYCHRL claims," and "even New York courts continue to grant and affirm the granting of summary judgment dismissing NYCHRL claims." Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 111-12 (citing Bennett for "affirming grant of summary judgment").
Based on the foregoing, the Union's motion for summary judgment on Diaz's NYCHRL claim of ethnicity/national [*112]  origin discrimination should be granted.

2. Diaz's State and City Law Disability Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims under the NYSHRL and NYCHRL must be addressed separately because of differences in the applicable statutes.
a. Disability Discrimination under the NYSHRL
"[T]he scope of disability protection under the NYSHRL is broader than under the ADA" and "thus a State law claim [may be] viable even assuming the insufficiency of an ADA cause of action." Bateman v. Project Hospitality, Inc., 07-cv-2085, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92411, at *37 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2009). Under the State Human Rights Law, "[t]he term 'disability' means (a) a physical, mental or medical impairment resulting from anatomical, physiological, genetic or neurological conditions which prevents the exercise of normal bodily function or is demonstrable by medically accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques . . ." N.Y. Exec. L. § 292(21). "'In other words, any 'medically diagnosable impairment' is a disability under [the] NYSHRL.'" Bateman, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92411, at *38 (quoting Levine v. Smithtown Cent. Sch. Dist., 565 F. Supp. 2d 407, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2008)). For purposes of this analysis, the Court assumes that Plaintiff's heart condition and concomitant lifting restriction satisfy this relaxed standard, and that Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case. See Epstein v. Kalvin-Miller Int'l, Inc., 100 F. Supp. 2d 222, 229-30 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (finding the plaintiff's [*113]  type 2 diabetes and heart disease medical disabilities under the NYSHRL).
Nevertheless, Diaz's NYSHRL claim fails for the same reasons as his federal disability discrimination claim—namely, Defendant satisfied its "de minimis burden" of producing evidence of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for plaintiff's termination, and Diaz has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Union's explanation for his termination is a mere pretext for discrimination. See Epstein, 100 F. Supp. 2d at 230 (noting that, once a prima facie case is established, the burden-shifting scheme applicable to NYSHRL claims is virtually identical to the McDonnell Douglas standard" (citations omitted)). Indeed, while the NYSHRL has indisputably made it easier for plaintiffs to make out a prima facie case of discrimination, it did not materially alter the evidentiary showing required to successfully establish that the employer's given reasons for adverse employment actions were merely a pretext to cover up intentional discrimination.
As set forth above, there is simply no evidence to connect Diaz's termination with his heart condition or lifting restriction. In fact, Diaz has a history of heart disease, including a prior [*114]  heart attack, which he does not allege contributed to his prior disciplinary history, including two final written warnings. And, Diaz does not allege that, even after his 2012 heart attack, either of these conditions impeded him in the performance of his primary job functions in any way. With respect to his need for cardiac rehabilitation, it is undisputed that the Union did not prevent Diaz from attending his appointments, but instead attached a single reasonable condition upon such attendance—namely, that he advise his supervisors of his rehab schedule, something Diaz admits he failed to do on the morning of April 1, 2013, and further admits was his "mistake." In addition, Diaz indicated in his Outlook calendar that he would be unavailable due to rehabilitation from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. on the morning he was terminated. This turned out to be inaccurate, resulting in Diaz completing his session at approximately 9:00 a.m., yet he failed to advise the Union that his appointment ran late, failed to check in afterwards, and failed to perform any Union work between the conclusion of the appointment and his 11:00 a.m. job assignment. This conduct came in addition to Diaz's failure during the [*115]  prior week to work the 35 hours required of him, instead leaving at 3:00 p.m. (a total of four-hour workdays) because he unilaterally decided that he should avoid the stress of traffic and, in any event, considered the time he spent commuting "work time." Accordingly, the proof put forth by Diaz is insufficient to defeat summary judgment under the NYSHRL as a matter of law.
b. Disability Discrimination under the NYCHRL
A similar analysis requires summary judgment in favor of the Union on Diaz's NYCHRL disability claim. The City statute relaxes the burden for a prima facie case even further than its State counterpart, defining a disability as "'any physical, medical, mental or psychological impairment,' which is then defined, in relevant part, as 'an impairment of any system: the musculoskeletal system; the special sense organs and respiratory organs, including but not limited to, speech organs; the cardiovascular system; the reproductive system; the digestive and genito-urinary systems; the hemic and lymphatic systems; the immunological systems; the skin; and the endocrine system." Spiegel v. Schulmann, 604 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(16)(a)-(b)) (noting that "[t]his definition of disability is, on its face, broader than that [*116]  provided by the NYSHRL"). As set forth in greater length above, however, even assuming Diaz satisfies this lenient standard for establishing a disability and can state a prima facie claim, there is simply no evidence that the Union's decision to terminate him was motivated, even in part, by discriminatory animus. To the contrary, the only reasonable conclusion supported by the record is that Diaz's poor performance, which had long since resulted in progressive disciplinary action predating the onset of his alleged disability, and which continued after his return from FMLA leave, formed the basis of his termination. As a result, Defendant's motion for summary judgment should be granted.17

E. Plaintiff's Claims of Discovery Abuses
Lastly, Diaz claims that "discovery abuses" by the Union impeded his ability to effectively oppose Defendant's motion for summary judgment, which itself allegedly gives rise to an inference of discrimination. See Pl. Memo of Law in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., DE [61], at 25. In this regard, Diaz incorporates a second motion, DE [39], that he filed prior to and apart from the instant motions, which seeks broad sanctions against [*118]  the Union. However, in a separate Report and Recommendation, this Court concluded that Plaintiff's discovery-related claims are untimely under Judge Feuerstein's Individual Rules, and, in any event, are without merit. As a result, the Court recommended that Diaz's sanctions motion be denied and, relatedly, those discovery-related claims are insufficient to defeat summary judgment here.

V. Conclusion
For the reasons contained herein, I recommend to Judge Feuerstein that Defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the Amended Complaint be granted, and Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on his FMLA claim be denied.

VI. Objections
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) and Rule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the parties shall have fourteen days from service of this Report and Recommendation to file written objections. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) and (e). Such objections by an attorney of record shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court via ECF. A courtesy copy of any objections is to be sent to the Chambers of the Honorable Sandra J. Feuerstein. Any requests for an extension of time for filing objections must be directed to Judge Feuerstein prior to the expiration of the fourteen-day period for filing objections. Failure to file objections will result [*119]  in a waiver of those objections for purposes of appeal. See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 155, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985); Beverly v. Walker, 118 F.3d 900, 901 (2d Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 883, 118 S. Ct. 211, 139 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1997); Savoie v. Merchants Bank, 84 F.3d 52, 60 (2d Cir. 1996).
