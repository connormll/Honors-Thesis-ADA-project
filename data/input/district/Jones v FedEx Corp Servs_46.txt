Opinion



CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: (In Chambers) Order Re: Pending Motion
Having reviewed and considered all the briefing filed with respect to defendant FedEx Corporate Services, Inc.'s ("defendant" or "FedEx") Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment [] (Dkt. 39, "Motion"), the court finds that oral argument is not necessary to resolve the Motion, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b); Local Rule 7-15; Willis v. Pac. Mar. Ass'n, 244 F.3d 675, 684 n. 2 (9th Cir. 2001), and concludes as follows.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Monique Jones ("plaintiff" or "Jones") filed this action in the Los Angeles County Superior Court on June 12, 2018. [*2]  (See Dkt. 1-5, Complaint). FedEx removed the case on July 11, 2018, based on diversity jurisdiction. (See Dkt. 1, Notice of Removal at 1-2). Pursuant to California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq., plaintiff asserts claims for: (1) disability discrimination; (2) failure to accommodate; (3) failure to engage in the interactive process; (4) retaliation; and (5) failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and retaliation. (See Dkt. 1-5, Complaint at ¶¶ 24-80). Plaintiff also asserts a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED"). (See id. at ¶¶ 81-92). Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages. (Id. at Prayer).

STATEMENT OF FACTS1
I. PLAINTIFF'S EMPLOYMENT.
In 1994, Jones began working for Federal Express Corporation, a FedEx entity, as a handler. (See Dkt. 39-3, Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("SUF") at 1-2; Dkt. 39-2, Defendant FedEx Corporate Services, Inc's Evidentiary Appendix ("DEX"), Exh. 1, Deposition of Monique Jones ("Jones Depo.") at 15). In late 2007, Jones began working for defendant FedEx, (see Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 4; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 27; id., Exh. 6, Offer Letter & Acceptance), as a "Director Admin" to support Director Mary [*3]  Gonzales ("Gonzales"). (See Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 6, Offer Letter & Acceptance). Jones has and continues to work for Gonzales. (See id., Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 72; Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 4; see also Dkt. 39-1, Defendant's Brief Re: Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment ("Memo") at 1) (Jones "started working for her Director, Mary Gonzales in 2007 and still works for her."). In 2012, Jones and her department moved to her current office location. (Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 5).
Plaintiff is currently a non-exempt hourly employee. (Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 6). According to plaintiff, her essential job duties were doing "whatever [her] boss [Gonzales] tell[s] [her] to do:" answering phones, making her travel arrangements, doing her expenses, maintaining her calendar, and "anything that's in the office[.]" (See id. at 7; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 67-68).
II. FEDEX POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.
Plaintiff is aware of FedEx's policies and procedures. (See Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 59). FedEx has an Employee Requested Alternative Work Arrangement policy, (see Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 11), which provides three different alternative work arrangements: (1) a flexible work schedule; (2) telecommuting, [*4]  which allows "employees who regularly spend at least one day per week working from their home or somewhere other than their work office at a FedEx facility[;]" and (3) remote work, which refers to "an employee whose home is their primary office location and does not have a permanent work office at a FedEx facility." (See id.; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 7, AWA Policy at ECF 356-572). Only the first option, a flexible work schedule, is considered appropriate for both exempt and non-exempt employees. (See Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 11; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 7, AWA Policy at ECF 356). The last two options are considered appropriate only for exempt employees. (See Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 11; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 7, AWA Policy at ECF 356-57).
FedEx also has a Computer Resources policy, relating to the use of company-issued cell phones and laptop computers. (See Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 12). The policy provides that "[n]onexempt employees are not provided VPN access, or a Company-issued cell phone, tablet, laptop computer, or any other portable communication device which allows access to FedEx computer or email systems." (Id.; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 8, Computer Policy at ECF 361). However, a manager may request an exception from this policy. (See [*5]  Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 8, Computer Policy at ECF 361).
Plaintiff previously had a FedEx-issued cell phone, but she was required to return it after she received an email notifying her that non-exempt employees could not have cell phones. (See Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 48; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 209-10). Plaintiff never asked Gonzales for another company-issued cell phone. (See Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 49; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 210).
III. PLAINTIFF'S 2017 INJURY AND REQUEST FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.
During a FedEx event in 2017, plaintiff injured her back and filed a workers' compensation claim. (See Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 22; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 36-37). The claims adjuster referred plaintiff to Dr. Jae Chon, who, in July 2017, imposed a 10-pound lifting restriction. (See Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 37-38, 204).
On November 2, 2017, plaintiff submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation. (See Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 23; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 187; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 9, November Request Correspondence). On November 3, 2017, FedEx3 acknowledged receipt of Jones's request for accommodation. (See Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 26; Dkt. 39-2, Exh. 9, November Request Correspondence at ECF [*6]  363) ("On November 2, 2017, we received your request for an at work accommodation[.] Your claim number is 16695003."). FedEx provided Jones an Accommodation Request form and asked that it be completed by her physician by November 24, 2017. (See Dkt. 39-2, Exh. 9, November Request Correspondence at ECF 364-68).
Jones requested the following accommodations to enable her to perform the essential functions of her job: (1) a 10-pound lifting restriction; (2) a laptop and cell phone; and (3) the ability to work from her home on occasion when she was in pain and there were "no office meetings." (See Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 24; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 12, Claim Form at ECF 377; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 11, Accommodation Request Letter at ECF 373). The specific requested accommodations were listed by plaintiff in the Leave Claim form she signed on December 1, 2017. (See Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 12, Claim Form at ECF 377; id., Exh. 11, Accommodation Request Letter at ECF 373). In response to the question on the Leave Claim form, "What would help you do your job with your disability, or help you return to work from a leave of absence?" plaintiff responded:
I am requesting access to have all the tools needed to do my job [*7]  successfully like the rest of the admins here in our office. I do not have a laptop or a company cellphone. My body hurt[s] and it would be nice to be able to work from home when I am hurting. I don't want to abuse it only when we have no office meetings. I have four knots protruding out of my back and wearing a bra is very uncomfortable with my [illegible] unit connected to me with all these wires and cords, I would feel better being in the comfort of my own home working. Most of the time, I am the only admin in the office working because the[other admins] have laptops and work offsite. Why am I being discriminated [against?]
(Id., Exh. 12, Claim Form at ECF 377; id., Exh. 11, Accommodation Request Letter at ECF 373).
Despite plaintiff's December 1, 2017, Leave Claim form, FedEx, on December 8, 2017, informed plaintiff that it was closing her accommodation request because it had not received the necessary documentation to approve or deny her request. (Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 28; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 10, December 8 Letter). The letter advised plaintiff that if FedEx got "the information then [it] might be able to re-open [the] claim." (Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 10, December 8 Letter).
On December 21, 2017, [*8]  in connection with plaintiff's accommodation request, plaintiff's medical provider, Dr. Chon, informed FedEx that "Patient is limited to lifting only 10 pounds maximum" during the period "9-18-2017 until 10-18-2018[.]" (Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 29; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 192-93; id., Exh. 12, Claim Form at ECF 378-79).
In a January 16, 2018, letter, FedEx informed plaintiff, that it was still missing information and asked her to clarify her accommodation request. (Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 30; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 196; id., Exh. 13, January 16 Letter). The letter stated: "We received your ADA paperwork but we're still missing the following information: Please clarify the accommodation request." (Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 13, January 16 Letter at ECF 381). The letter also enclosed another FedEx Accommodation Request form, (see id. at 382-85), and advised plaintiff that the Accommodation Request form had to be completed and returned to FedEx by January 26, 2018. (See id. at 381).
On January 29, 2018, FedEx informed plaintiff that her 10-pound lifting restriction was approved, stating, in a confusing manner: "Permanent stay at work accommodation — Approved for 'no lifting over 10 pounds' 9/18/2017 through 10/18/18." [*9] 4 (Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 32; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 197-98; id., Exh. 14, January 29 Letter I). Even more confusing, on the same date that it granted plaintiff's request for a lifting restriction, FedEx sent her a separate letter, stating that it had "denied [her] request . . . for an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)." (Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 35; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 198; id., Exh. 15, January 29 Letter II). This was the last communication plaintiff received from FedEx regarding her accommodation requests. (See Dkt. 39-3, SUF at 36; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 199).

LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the granting of summary judgment "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." The standard for granting a motion for summary judgment is essentially the same as for granting a directed verdict. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Judgment must be entered "if, under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Id.
The moving party has the initial burden of identifying relevant portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a fact or facts necessary for [*10]  one or more essential elements of each cause of action upon which the moving party seeks judgment. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the moving party fails to carry its initial burden of production, "the nonmoving party has no obligation to produce anything." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000).
If the moving party has sustained its burden, the burden then shifts to the nonmovant to identify specific facts, drawn from materials in the file, that demonstrate that there is a dispute as to material facts on the elements that the moving party has contested. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. at 2553; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. at 2514 (A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment "must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.").5 A factual dispute is material only if it affects the outcome of the litigation and requires a trial to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth. SEC v. Seaboard Corp., 677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir. 1982). Summary judgment must be granted for the moving party if the nonmoving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552; see Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512 (parties bear the same substantive burden of proof as would apply at a trial on the merits).
In determining whether a triable issue [*11]  of material fact exists, the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1134 (9th Cir. 1991). However, summary judgment cannot be avoided by relying solely on "conclusory allegations [in] an affidavit." Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 3188, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1990); see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (more than a "metaphysical doubt" is required to establish a genuine issue of material fact). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position" is insufficient to survive summary judgment; "there must be evidence on which the [fact finder] could reasonably find for the plaintiff." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512.

DISCUSSION
I. FEHA CLAIMS.6
Defendant moves for summary judgment on all of plaintiff's FEHA claims on the grounds that there are no genuine issues of material fact. (See Dkt. 39, Motion at 2-3).
A. Disability Discrimination.
FEHA makes it unlawful "[f]or an employer, because of the . . . physical disability . . . of any person . . . to bar or to discharge the person from employment . . . or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). "California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination[.]" [*12]  Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal.4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000).
To make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) she is disabled within the statutory definition; (2) she was otherwise qualified to perform the essential job functions; and (3) she was subjected to an adverse employment action because of her disability. See Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal.App.4th 864, 886, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007); Furtado v. State Pers. Bd., 212 Cal.App.4th 729, 744, 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 292 (2013). Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case for discrimination, "the burden shifts to the defendant to [articulate a] legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision. . . . This [] is not an onerous burden and is generally met by presenting admissible evidence showing the defendant's reason for its employment decision[.]" Wills v. Superior Court, 195 Cal.App.4th 143, 160, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see Mills v. Lynwood Unified Sch. Dist., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69427, 2009 WL 2460789, *3 (C.D. Cal. 2009) ("The plaintiff's prima facie burden is not onerous, but the plaintiff must at least show actions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if such actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on [disability.]") (internal quotation marks omitted). "Finally, if the defendant presents evidence showing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the burden again shifts to the plaintiff to establish the defendant intentionally discriminated [*13]  against him or her." Wills, 195 Cal.App.4th at 160. "The plaintiff may satisfy this burden by proving the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were false, creating an inference that those reasons served as a pretext for discrimination." Id.
Adverse employment actions are not limited to ultimate decisions, e.g., hiring, firing, or promotion, but may also include intermediate retaliatory actions. See Akers v. Cnty. of San Diego, 95 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1455, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 602 (2002); Ray v. Henderson, 217 F.3d 1234, 1240-41 (9th Cir. 2000). (The Ninth Circuit "take[s] an expansive view of the types of actions that can be considered adverse employment actions" such that "a wide array of disadvantageous changes in the workplace [can] constitute adverse employment actions."). It is ultimately whether the employee's "compensation" or "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment[,]" Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1054-55, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005), were affected which determines whether the employee suffered an adverse employment action.
For purposes of the instant Motion, defendant assumes that plaintiff has established the first two elements of her prima facie case. (See Dkt. 39-1, Memo at 11). FedEx contends that plaintiff cannot establish the third element, an adverse employment action, because of her disability. (See id. at 11-12). According to FedEx, plaintiff suffered no adverse employment action because the complained-of conduct, [*14]  namely, (1) plaintiff's allegations that Gonzales yelled at her; (2) that plaintiff was informed that she would no longer be facilitating Gonzales's weekly management team conference calls; and (3) the denial of her requests for a laptop, cell phone, and to work from home, (see id. at 12), do not "rise to the level of adverse employment actions." (Id.). However, FedEx only addresses plaintiff's complaint relating to Gonzales's yelling at plaintiff, (see id.); see also Yanowitz 36 Cal.4th at 1054 ("[A] mere offensive utterance or even a pattern of social slights be either the employer or co-employees cannot properly be viewed as materially affecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment[.]"), and ignores the other complained-of conduct. (See, generally, Dkt. 39-1, Memo at 12). FedEx repeats this practice by contending that "[e]ven presuming that the complained of actions could be construed as adverse employment actions, FedEx had legitimate business reasons for its responses to Plaintiff's requests[,]" yet only addresses plaintiff's request for a laptop and cell phone. (See id. at 12-13). However, there is evidence that other employees in the same position as plaintiff were provided laptops and cellphones. (Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. [*15]  12, Claim Form at ECF 377; id., Exh. 11, Accommodation Request Letter at ECF 373). In any event, FedEx has not shown that plaintiff does not possess evidence needed to support her prima facie case nor has FedEx presented evidence conclusively negating the adverse employment action element of the prima facie case. See Reynaga v. Rosenburg Forest Prods., 847 F.3d 678, 691 (9th Cir. 2017) ("[W]e require very little evidence to survive summary judgment in a discrimination case, because the ultimate question is one that can only be resolved through a searching inquiry — one that is most appropriately conducted by the fact finder, upon a full record.") (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, summary judgment as to plaintiff's discrimination claim is denied. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. at 2513 (noting that trial court has discretion to "deny summary judgment in a case where there is reason to believe that the better course would be to proceed to a full trial").
B. Failure to Accommodate.
Under FEHA, "reasonable accommodation" means "a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 974, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). Reasonable accommodation may include either of the following:
(1) Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible [*16]  to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities[; or] (2) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, adjustment or modification of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p); see 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9).
"FEHA requires employers to make reasonable accommodation for the known disability of an employee unless doing so would produce undue hardship to the employer's operation." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal.App.4th 359, 373, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015); Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(1) (FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to "fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee."). "The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are: '(1) the plaintiff has a disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability.'" Nigro v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 784 F.3d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange County, Inc., 173 Cal.App.4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009)). "The duty to reasonably accommodate a disabled employee is a continuing one that is not exhausted by one effort." Atkins v. City of Los Angeles, 8 Cal.App.5th 696, 722, 214 Cal. Rptr. 3d 113 (2017). "A single failure to reasonably accommodate an employee may [*17]  give rise to liability, despite other efforts at accommodation." Swanson v. Morongo Unified Sch. Dist., 232 Cal.App.4th 954, 969, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014); Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal.App.4th 34, 54, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006) (An "employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual is a violation of the statute in and of itself.") (internal quotation marks omitted).
FedEx contends that it did not fail to accommodate plaintiff by refusing to allow her to work from home on occasion when she's in pain because "Plaintiff does not dispute that two of the essential functions of her job — getting the mail and acting as the office receptionist — can only be performed at the office location." (Dkt. 39-1, at 11) (citing Dkt. 39-3, SUF 7-8; Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 67-68, 72-73, 158, 161). In effect, FedEx appears to be arguing that because getting the mail and acting as the office receptionist can only be performed at the office, it was not obligated to accommodate plaintiff by allowing her to work from home. (See id.).
"'Essential functions' means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires. Essential functions does not include the marginal functions of the position." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f). "Marginal functions of an employment position are those that, if not performed, would not eliminate [*18]  the need for the job or that could be readily performed by another employee or that could be performed in an alternative way." 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(e)(3). "A highly fact-specific inquiry is necessary to determine what a particular job's essential functions are." Cripe, 261 F.3d at 888 n. 12 (9th Cir. 2001). Moreover, "[t]he reasonableness of an accommodation generally is a question of fact." Nealy, 234 Cal.App.4th at 374.
"Evidence of 'essential functions' may include the employer's judgment, written job descriptions, the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, the consequences of not requiring employees to perform the function, the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, the work experience of past incumbents in the job, and the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs." Atkins, 8 Cal.App.5th at 717-18. Here, FedEx put forth little, if any, evidence as to the essential functions of plaintiff's job. (See, generally, Dkt. 39-2, DEX); see Fuqua v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167452, 2017 WL 4516843, *18 (N.D. Cal. 2017) ("The difficulty of determining essential functions with certainty is compounded in this case by the scant factual record regarding the positions at issue."). The only purported evidence of plaintiff's essential functions FedEx cites is plaintiff's testimony that she "believes" her job is "to do whatever [her] boss tell[s] [her] to do: answer [*19]  phones, do her [boss's] travel, her expenses, her calendar; anything that's in the office since we rent from PCT. So I pay the rent." (Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 67-68). Even assuming plaintiff's testimony was sufficient to establish the essential job functions of her position, see Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(2) (listing bases for deeming a job function essential and evidence pertinent to the issue), plaintiff did not testify that an essential job duty of her position was to get the mail or act as the office receptionist. (See, generally, Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 67-68). Instead, when asked what she understood her essential job duties to be, plaintiff replied: "I believe it's to do whatever my boss tell[s] me to do: answer phones, do her travel, her expenses, her calendar; anything that's in the office since we rent from PCT. So I pay the rent." (Id. at 67-68). At most, plaintiff's testimony raises an issue of fact as to whether the duties plaintiff testified to (i.e., getting the mail and acting as a receptionist) constitute "marginal functions" that, "if not performed, would not eliminate the need for the job or that could be readily performed by another employee or that could be performed in an [*20]  alternative way." 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(e)(3).
Moreover, evidence in the record indicates that other "admins" had laptops and worked from home. (See Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 228-29; id., Exh. 12, Claim Form at ECF 377 ("I am requesting access to have all the tools needed to do my job successfully like the rest of the admins here in our office. I do not have a laptop or a company cellphone. . . . Most of the time, I am the only admin in the office working because the [other admins] have laptops and work offsite.")); see Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f) ("'Essential functions' means the fundamental job duties of the employment position [and] does not include the marginal functions of the position."). Given that FedEx allows employees in similar or equivalent jobs to have laptops and work from home, there is clearly a question of fact as to whether FedEx failed to accommodate plaintiff's disability. See, e.g., Concialdi v. Jacobs Engineering Group, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128041, 2019 WL 3084282, *9 (C.D. Cal. 2019) (finding triable issues of fact existed where plaintiff "was not offered the option to work from home, though other auditors in his department did so, and he was required to take paid time off for his disability).
FedEx adds that plaintiff's "own medical providers do not indicate that her medical condition/disability warrants [*21]  a work from home accommodation." (Dkt. 39-1, Memo at 11). However, FedEx provides no authority for the proposition that an employee's medical provider must indicate that a particular accommodation is necessary in order for an employer to consider a reasonable accommodation. (See, generally, id.). Even so, there is evidence that because of FedEx's actions, plaintiff was no longer able to seek treatment or discuss possible accommodations with Dr. Chon. (See Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 196-97) (testifying that she could not go back to Dr. Chon for additional documentation "[b]ecause he stated in June that he was sorry, but he could no longer treat me because he received word from [FedEx] that I don't push, pull or pick up anything [and s]o I didn't have a doctor to fill this out. I have been without any medicine or no treatment since the doctor said he could no longer treat me in June.").
In short, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, a reasonable jury could conclude that FedEx failed to reasonably accommodate plaintiff's disability. See Wong v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 192 F.3d 807, 818 (9th Cir. 1999) ("Because the issue of reasonableness depends on the individual circumstances of each case, this determination requires a fact-specific, [*22]  individualized analysis of the disabled individual's circumstances[.]"); Swanson, 232 Cal.App.4th at 969 ("A single failure to reasonably accommodate an employee may give rise to liability, despite other efforts at accommodation.").
C. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process.
FEHA requires an employer to "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). "[T]he interactive process is a mandatory rather than a permissive obligation on the part of employers [and] is triggered by an employee . . . giving notice of the employee's disability and the desire for accommodation." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal.App.4th 245, 261, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Under FEHA, "the interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identifying an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 261 (internal quotation and alteration marks omitted). "[B]oth sides must communicate directly, exchange essential information [*23]  and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." Id. It is critical for employers to comply with these requirements given that "[e]mployees do not have at their disposal the extensive information concerning possible alternative positions or possible accommodations which employers have." Id. at 262. "[I]f the process fails, responsibility for the failure rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith." Gelfo, 140 Cal.App.4th at 54. "While a claim of failure to accommodate is independent of a cause of action for failure to engage in an interactive dialogue, each necessarily implicates the other." Moore v. Regents of University of California, 248 Cal.App.4th 216, 242, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016).
FedEx contends that it considered plaintiff's two requested accommodations: (1) the 10-pound lifting restriction and (2) the ability to work from home. (See Dkt 39-1, Memo at 9). FedEx claims it granted the former, but rejected the latter, and that "[w]hile Plaintiff did not get every accommodation she requested, her disability is being accommodated by FedEx. (See id.). FedEx states that it "requested that Plaintiff's medical provider provide additional information to support her requested accommodation — specifically her work from home request[,]" (id.) (citing Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 196; id., Exh. 13, [*24]  January 16 Letter), but that Dr. Chon failed to provide FedEx with any rationale that would support a remote working request. (Id.) (citing Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 192-93, 196-97; id., Exh. 13, January 16 Letter; id., Exh. 12, Claim Form). However, as noted above, there is evidence that because of FedEx's actions, plaintiff was no longer able to seek treatment or discuss possible accommodations with Dr. Chon. (See Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo. at 196-97) (testifying that she could not go back to Dr. Chon for additional documentation "[b]ecause he stated in June that he was sorry, but he could no longer treat me because he received word from [FedEx] that I don't push, pull or pick up anything [and s]o I didn't have a doctor to fill this out. I have been without any medicine or no treatment since the doctor said he could no longer treat me in June."). Aside from that, FedEx's January 16, 2018, letter which appears to be a form letter, was vague and merely stated, in relevant part: "We received your ADA paperwork, but we're still missing the following information: Please clarify the accommodation request." (See Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 13, January 16 Letter at ECF 381). [*25]  The letter does not make clear which requested accommodation it is referring to and what additional information FedEx needed as to the unspecified accommodation. (See, generally, id.). Instead, it simply attached another Accommodation Request form. (See id. at 381-85). Subsequently, on January 29, 2018, FedEx "denied [plaintiff's] request for an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)." (Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 15, January 29, 2018 Letter II). But the January 29, 2018, letter only confused the situation. Based on that letter, FedEx denied all of plaintiff's requests for a reasonable accommodation, including the 10-pound lifting restriction. (See id.).
"FEHA requires an informal process with the employee to attempt to identify reasonable accommodations, not necessarily ritualized discussions." Nealy, 234 Cal.App.4th at 379. "[B]oth sides must communicate directly, exchange essential information and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 261. Here, there is no evidence of any discussions between FedEx and plaintiff with respect to plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation. (See, generally, Dkt. 39-2, DEX). Far from a good-faith, interactive process, the record indicates that FedEx engaged plaintiff [*26]  sporadically with boilerplate letters that failed to address the specifics of her accommodation requests. (See, e.g., id., Exh. 13, January 16 Letter; Exh. 15, January 29, 2018 Letter II). Without an informal, interactive process that is conducted in good faith, plaintiff could not "necessarily be expected to identify and request all possible accommodations during the interactive process itself because [e]mployees do not have at their disposal the extensive information concerning possible alternative positions or possible accommodations which employers have[.]" Scotch, 173 Cal.App.4th at 1018 (internal quotation marks omitted). In short, there are issues of fact regarding whether FedEx engaged in "good faith" in the "interactive process" with plaintiff with respect to her requests for reasonable accommodations. See Gelfo, 140 Cal.App.4th at 62 n. 22 ("Each party must participate in good faith, undertake reasonable efforts to communicate its concerns, and make available to the other information which is available, or more accessible, to one party. Liability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith.");  [*27] see also Swanson, 232 Cal.App.4th at 972 ("[T]he fact that an employer took some steps to work with an employee to identify reasonable accommodations does not absolve the employer of liability. . . . If the employer is responsible for a later breakdown in the process, it may be held liable.") (internal quotation marks omitted).
D. Retaliation.
Under FEHA, an employer may not "discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). FEHA also prohibits an employer from "retaliat[ing] or otherwise discriminat[ing] against a person for requesting accommodation . . . regardless of whether the request was granted." Id. at § 12940(m)(2). Retaliation claims under FEHA employ the McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting framework. See Flait v. N. Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal.App.4th 467, 474-75, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992). To prevail on her FEHA retaliation claim, plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) FedEx subjected her to an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Yanowitz, 36 Cal.4th at 1042. "The requisite 'causal link' may be shown by the temporal [*28]  relationship between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Light v. Dep't of Parks & Recreation, 14 Cal.App.5th 75, 91, 221 Cal. Rptr. 3d 668 (2017).
FedEx contends that plaintiff's retaliation claims are rooted "in her internal EEO complaint and her June 6, 2018 DFEH Charge of Discrimination[,]" and that plaintiff suffered no resulting adverse action. (See Dkt. 39-1, Memo at 14). The court agrees that plaintiff has not identified an adverse action that is causally related to the filing of the internal EEO complaint and DFEH complaint. (See, generally, Dkt. 39-2, DEX, Exh. 1, Jones Depo.). Accordingly, the court grants summary judgment as to plaintiff's retaliation claim.
E. Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation.
Under the FEHA, it is illegal for an employer "to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). When a plaintiff seeks to recover damages based on a claim of failure to prevent discrimination or retaliation, "[s]he must show three essential elements: (1) plaintiff was subjected to discrimination, harassment or retaliation; (2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination, harassment or retaliation; and (3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, [*29]  loss or harm." Adetuyi v. City and County of San Francisco, 63 F.Supp.3d. 1073, 1092-93 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (interpreting FEHA). "The employer's duty to prevent harassment and discrimination is affirmative and mandatory." Northrop Grumman Corp. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 103 Cal.App.4th 1021, 1035, 127 Cal. Rptr. 2d 285, (2002).
FedEx's only argument is that the claim fails because plaintiff's discrimination claims fail. (See Dkt. 39-1, Memo at 14-15). The court agrees in part. Because plaintiff's failure to prevent discrimination or retaliation claim is derivative of her claims discussed above, summary judgment is granted as to the retaliation portion of the claim and denied as to the discrimination portion of the claim. See, e.g., Goins v. Cty. of Merced, 185 F.Supp.3d 1224, 1241 (E.D. Cal. 2016) (granting summary judgment on failure to prevent retaliation claim based on grant of summary judgment on retaliation claim); Solano v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48372, 2005 WL 1984473, *5 (E.D. Cal. 2005) ("[B]ecause plaintiff's claim for race discrimination survives summary judgment, as discussed above, [he] has satisfied the foundational requirement for application of the section [and] [t]hus, plaintiff has established a triable issue on [his] claim for failure to prevent discrimination under FEHA.").
II. INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.
FedEx seeks summary judgment as to plaintiff's IIED claim. (See Dkt. 39-1, Memo at 15-16). Plaintiff may pursue an IIED claim where the conduct at issue violates FEHA and also satisfies the elements of the [*30]  claim. The elements of an IIED claim are: "(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct." Miller v. Fortune Commercial Corp., 15 Cal.App.5th 214, 228-29, 223 Cal. Rptr. 3d 133 (2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). The outrageous conduct "must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized society." Id. at 229 (internal quotation marks omitted); Christensen v. Super. Court, 54 Cal.3d 868, 903, 2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 79, 820 P.2d 181 (1991) (same). "Liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities." Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1051, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff cites no evidence of "extreme and outrageous conduct" by defendant beyond Gonzales yelling at her. Viewing the conduct at issue in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the court is persuaded that defendant's conduct was not extreme, outrageous, or beyond the bounds of what is usually tolerated in civilized society. See, e.g., Hawkins v. SimplexGrinnell, L.P., 640 F.Appx. 640, 644 (9th Cir. 2016) (affirming district court's grant of summary judgment on plaintiff's IIED claim [*31]  despite finding triable issues of fact on underlying FEHA age discrimination claim); Kasperzyk v. Shelter Security Servs., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, 2015 WL 1348503, *12 (N.D. Cal. 2015) ("At least in the absence of some extraordinary circumstances, a claim of employment discrimination [in violation of FEHA] does not, in itself, give rise to an IIED claim."); Rezvan v. Phillips Elec. N. Am. Corp., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173734, 2016 WL 8193160, *10 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (granting summary judgment on IIED claim while denying summary judgment on FEHA discrimination and retaliation claims where plaintiff was given a negative performance review, denied a raise or bonus, and ultimately terminated). Since plaintiff cannot show that she was subjected to extreme and outrageous conduct, the court grants summary judgment as to the IIED claim.7
III. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
As for punitive damages, to create a material issue of fact in a case against a corporate defendant, "the evidence must demonstrate that an officer, director or managing agent of Defendant committed, authorized or ratified an act of malice, oppression or fraud[.]" McInteer v. Ashley Distrib. Servs., Ltd., 40 F.Supp.3d 1269, 1295 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (internal quotation and alteration marks omitted); see also Commodore Home Sys., Inc. v. Super. Ct., 32 Cal.3d 211, 220, 185 Cal. Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912 (1982) (holding that punitive damages are recoverable for FEHA violations). "[M]alice does not require actual intent to harm." Angie M. v. Super. Ct., 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228, 44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 197 (1995). Even "[un]intentional conduct comes within the definition of malicious acts punishable by the assessment [*32]  of punitive damages when a party intentionally performs an act from which he knows, or should know, it is highly probable that harm will result." Ford Motor Co. v. Homes Ins. Co., 116 Cal. App. 3d 374, 381, 172 Cal. Rptr. 59 (1981).
FedEx asserts that "Gonzales has not acted with oppression, fraud or malice in her dealings with Plaintiff" and that there is no evidence that "Gonzales exercises any control over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy." (Dkt. 39-1, Memo at 17-18). Whether employees exercise managerial authority is a fact-specific inquiry determined on a case-by-case basis. See Muniz v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 731 F. Supp. 2d 961, 976 (N.D. Cal. 2010). Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, see Barlow, 943 F.2d at 1134, there is an issue of fact as to whether Gonzales was a managing agent with "broad discretionary powers and [who] exercise[d] substantial discretionary authority in the corporation[.]" White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal.4th 563, 577, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999). Further, "[b]ecause Plaintiff's FEHA claim for [disability] discrimination survives summary judgment, the court finds it would be premature to dismiss h[er] request for punitive damages." McInteer, 40 F.Supp.3d at 1295. Accordingly, summary judgment as to punitive damages is denied. See, e.g., Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments, 171 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1053, 90 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (2009) ("[S]ummary judgment on the issue of punitive damages is proper only when no reasonable jury could find the plaintiff's evidence to be clear and convincing proof [*33]  of malice, fraud or oppression.") (internal quotation marks omitted).

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED THAT defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Document 39) is granted in part and denied in part. The Motion is granted as to plaintiff's Retaliation, Failure to Prevent Retaliation, and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress claims. The Motion is denied in all other respects.
