ORDER RE: MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

I.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Daryon Walker ("Walker") filed this employment discrimination lawsuit against T-Mobile USA, Inc. ("T-Mobile") for disability discrimination, failure to accommodate/engage in the interactive process, and retaliation. Walker began work as a sales associate at a T-Mobile retail store in April 2007. Less than four months after starting work, Walker took a four month leave of absence after undergoing knee surgery. He returned to work in December 2007. However, in February 2008, as Walker was opening the T-Mobile store with a fellow employee, the store was robbed at gunpoint. Because of the stress and anxiety of the incident, Walker took a second leave of absence beginning in March 2008. As part of his medical leave, T-Mobile required Walker and his doctor to submit certain paperwork documenting his leave of absence. Although Walker believed he had provided all necessary paperwork related to his disability leave, T-Mobile consistently indicated that he had failed to provide [*2]  a complete set of documentation. After receiving a number of deadline extensions, Walker finally submitted a complete set of documents to T-Mobile's satisfaction in June 2008. T-Mobile approved Walker's disability leave in a letter dated June 30, 2008, and indicated that he must submit a work release note from his doctor on July 16, 2008, and actually return to work on July 20, 2008.
Walker did not return to work on July 20, 2008, because he had a follow up appointment with his doctor on that date. Walker kept the appointment. His doctor advised that Walker was not cleared to return to work, and certified him as disabled through September 21, 2008. On July 22, 2008, Walker contacted his employer, left a message regarding his status, and requested that he be provided with an updated accommodation packet. Walker placed a second call to his employer on July 25, 2008, but was unable to reach anyone. At that point, Walker was unconcerned about not reporting on July 20, 2008, because his supervisor had advised him on July 8, 2008, that he had three days to report or contact the company regarding his disability.
Between July 22 and July 30, 2008, Walker and his employer engaged in "phone tag." [*3]  On or about July 30, 2008, having never actually spoken to Walker about his current condition, T-Mobile terminated Walker by sending him a letter that he received on August 4, 2008. Walker contacted T-Mobile and explained that he had been continued on disability and requested reinstatement. The request was denied and this lawsuit followed.
Although T-Mobile has identified a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Walker's termination, and although Walker may not appear to have a strong case against the defendant, the Court's role at this stage of the proceedings is not to decide the case but to decide whether or not Walker has presented evidence that the stated reason was a pretext to conceal a discriminatory and/or retaliatory animus. The Court concludes that he has accomplished that objective. Although Walker failed to comply with T-Mobile's instructions regarding when to return to work and failed to respond to T-Mobile's attempts to contact him, fault does not appear to lie with Walker alone. Walker has presented evidence that he called his store supervisor on July 22 and T-Mobile's Leave of Absence Administrator on July 25 regarding a disability extension and requesting the necessary [*4]  paperwork. Both of the T-Mobile representatives failed to respond. Without ever responding to any of Walker's requests or speaking with him regarding his status, T-Mobile terminated him. At the time of T-Mobile's decision to terminate Walker, T-Mobile knew that he was disabled, knew that he had requested additional leave from his doctor, and knew that he had received an extension of leave. In these circumstances, a trier of fact might find that Walker's continued disability and his need for further accommodation motivated T-Mobile to terminate Walker rather than provide him with a further disability leave, and that the decision to terminate was in retaliation for his exercise of his rights as a disabled employee.
For these reasons, which are explained in greater detail below, T-Mobile's motion for summary judgment is DENIED.

II.

BACKGROUND
On April 30, 2007, Walker began working as a Sales Associate at the Fox Hills T-Mobile Store located in Culver City, California.1 (Statement of Genuine Issues ("SGI") ¶¶ 1, 3.) T-Mobile Store Manager Jason Moreno hired Walker and acted as his supervisor.2 (Id. ¶ 2.)

A. First Leave of Absence
Less than four (4) months after his start date, Walker took his [*5]  first leave of absence due to knee surgery. (Id. ¶ 4.) Originally, the leave was approved from August 13, 2007 to November 5, 2007, but was then extended to December 5, 2007.3 (Id.; Ruse Decl., Ex. G.) Walker returned to work from his first leave of absence on December 5, 2007. (SGI ¶ 6.)

B. Second Leave of Absence
Approximately two and a half months later, on February 19, 2008, as Walker was opening the T-Mobile Store, the store was robbed. (Id. ¶ 7; Ruse Decl., Ex. H [Incident Report].) Because of the stress and anxiety of the incident, Walker sought medical attention from Dr. Oscar Moore. (SGI ¶ 61.) Dr. Moore issued Walker a disability certificate, placing him off duty from March 20, 2008 through May 20, 2008. (Id. ¶ 8.) Walker faxed the disability certificate to Diane Ruse, T-Mobile's Human Resources Manager, and was placed on a provisional accommodation leave pending the completion of the accommodation leave packet. (Id. ¶ 9.)

1. First Accommodation Packet
T-Mobile sent Walker an accommodation packet on March 26, 2008, with a packet return deadline of April 10, 2008. (Id. ¶ 10.) On April 8, 2008, T-Mobile sent Walker a second packet and extended the return deadline to April 23, 2008. [*6]  (SGI ¶ 11; Ruda Decl., Ex. B [Ruse Depo., Ex. 17].) In a letter dated May 2, 2008, Ms. Ruse informed Walker that he had failed to provide complete medical documentation regarding his leave and extended the deadline to May 6, 2008. (Ruda Decl., Ex. A [Walker Depo., Ex. 7].) On May 6, 2008, Walker faxed a response letter to Ms. Ruse, informing her that he believed he had provided all necessary paperwork related to his medical leave. (Walker Decl. ¶ 24, Ex. 3.) Both Ms. Ruse and Cecilli Pearse, T-Mobile's Leave of Absence Administrator, received Walker's letter. (SGI ¶ 71.) Ms. Ruse called and spoke with Walker after she received his May 6, 2008 letter.4 (Id. ¶ 46.)
After Walker's disability certification expired on May 20, 2008, T-Mobile faxed the accommodation packet to Walker's doctor on May 28, 2008, and emailed the packet to Walker on May 29, 2008, again extending his deadline to June 2, 2008 to complete the necessary paperwork. (Id. ¶ 14.) On June 16, 2008, T-Mobile sent an additional accommodation packet with Post-It notes instructing Walker and his physician how to fill out the attached forms. (Id. ¶ 15; Ruse Decl., Ex. I [June 16, 2008 letter].) Walker's deadline to complete the [*7]  packet was extended to June 26, 2008. (SGI ¶ 15; Ruse Decl., Ex. I.) Walker submitted all the necessary paperwork, which T-Mobile received on June 26, 2008. (Ruda Decl., Ex. A [Walker Depo., Ex. 10]; Walker Decl., Ex. 4.) On June 30, 2008, T-Mobile sent Walker a letter confirming that his leave was extended until July 20, 2008. (SGI ¶ 17.) The letter asked Walker to: (1) provide Ms. Pearse with a return to work release from his physician by July 16, 2008; and (2) return to work by July 20, 2008. (Id.; Walker Decl., Ex. 4.)

2. Walker Visits the T-Mobile Store
On July 8, 2008, Walker spoke with Mr. Moreno at the T-Mobile store and Mr. Moreno informed Walker that he needed a doctor's note clearing him to return to work. (SGI ¶ 75.) Walker told Mr. Moreno that his next appointment with the physician was July 20, 2008.5 (Ruda Decl., Ex. A [Walker Depo. at 326-27].) Mr. Moreno told Walker that he should not be concerned, as T-Mobile had a 3-day no call/no show policy. (Walker Decl. ¶ 33.) Under the policy, Walker would not lose his job as long as he communicated his status prior to the expiration of 3 days from his date to return to work—July 23, 2008. (Id. ¶ 34.)
Prior to leaving the store [*8]  on July 8, 2008, Walker spoke with a co-worker named George. (SGI ¶ 79.) George told Walker that, with regard to the robbery, the police were looking for him and that the managers had been talking about him. (Ruda Decl., Ex. A [Walker Depo. at 67-68].) However, Walker never reported this comment to anyone in management. (SGI ¶ 42.) Walker testified that no other statements or comments were made by any T-Mobile employee concerning his disability. (Id. ¶ 43.)

3. Second Accommodation Packet

• July 15, 2008: Mr. Moreno sent Walker a text message as a reminder to submit a doctor's note. (Ruda Decl., Ex. C [Moreno Depo. at 26].) Walker did not respond. (Id.)
• July 16, 2008: Walker was required to submit a work release note from his doctor on this date. (Walker Decl., Ex. 4.) However, Walker did not submit the doctor's note on or before July 16, 2008. (SGI ¶ 23.)
• July 17, 2008: Mr. Moreno called Walker and sent him text messages reminding him about the doctor's work release note. (Id. ¶¶ 24-25.) Mr. Moreno did not receive any response from Walker. (Ruda Decl., Ex. C [Moreno Depo. at 27].)
• July 18, 2008: Ms. Pearse called Walker, but he did not answer. (SGI ¶ 27.)
• July 20, 2008: Walker did [*9]  not show up for work on July 20, 2008. (Id. ¶ 28.)
• July 21, 2008: Walker visited his physician, and Dr. Moore extended Walker's leave to September 21, 2008.6 (Walker Decl. ¶¶ 37-38, Ex. 5; SGI ¶ 29.) However, Walker did not send T-Mobile his physician's note, failing to confirm that he had received an extended leave. (Id. ¶ 30.)
• July 22, 2008: Walker called Mr. Moreno two times, but did not speak with him. (Id. ¶ 31.) Walker left Mr. Moreno messages informing him that his leave was extended until September 21, 2008 and that he needed a certification packet to document his extension. (Id. ¶ 40.) Mr. Moreno never called Walker after this date. (Pl.'s Lodging of Evidence, Ex. 7 [Response to Admissions No. 6].)
• July 25, 2008: Walker called Ms. Pearse, but did not speak with her. (Id. ¶ 32.) Walker left Ms. Pearse a message, informing her that he had received an extension of leave and required a medical certification packet to give to his doctor to document the extension. (Walker Decl. ¶ 43.) Ms. Pearse never returned Walker's call. (Pl.'s Lodging of Evidence, Ex. 7 [Response to Admissions No. 7].)
• July 29, 2008: Ms. Ruse called Walker three times.7 (Ruda Decl., Ex. B [Ruse Depo. at 67, [*10]  Ex. 16].) She also sent an email to Walker regarding the status of his leave of absence. (Id. [Ex. 22].) Although Walker's phone had internet capability from July 25, 2008 to July 30, 2008, (SGI ¶ 38.), he claims that he did not receive the email until August 4, 2008. (Walker Decl. ¶ 52.)
• July 30, 2008: Ms. Ruse called Walker a single time, but did not speak with him.8 (Ruda Decl., Ex. B [Ruse Depo. at 67, Ex. 16].)

C. Walker's Employment is Terminated
In a letter dated July 30, 2008 (the letter was improperly dated—it was more likely sent on or after July 31, 2008 (Pl.'s Lodging of Evidence, Ex. A [Ruse Depo. at 113].)), Ruse informed Walker that his employment with T-Mobile was terminated. (Id. [Ruse Depo. at 54, Ex. 24].) The letter indicated that Plaintiff had been previously instructed to contact his manager a week before to discuss his work schedule, but failed to do so. (Id.) Furthermore, because Mr. Moreno and Ms. Ruse were unable to contact Plaintiff on various dates, Ms. Ruse informed Walker that a "voluntary resignation" would be processed and that his employment would be terminated for failure to return from his leave of absence. (Id.)
Walker received the termination [*11]  letter on August 4, 2008. (SGI ¶ 110.) Walker then immediately called Ms. Ruse. (Ruda Decl., Ex. B [Ruse Depo. at 126], Ex. A [Walker Depo., Ex. 31].) Walker attempted to explain that he had contacted Mr. Moreno on July 22, 2008 and Ms. Pearse on July 25, 2008, requested an extension of leave, and was waiting to receive the leave packet. (Walker Decl. ¶ 55.) Walker also requested that he be reinstated, but his request was denied. (Id. ¶¶ 56-57.) Walker states that he was never given an explanation other than the fact that he had overstayed his leave and failed to stay in contact with T-Mobile as the reason for his termination. (SGI ¶ 44.) Defendant does not contest this assertion.

II.

DISCUSSION

A. Legal Standard
Summary judgment is proper where "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Thus, when addressing a motion for summary judgment, the Court must decide whether there exists "any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either [*12]  party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The moving party has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of fact for trial. See id. at 256. Where there is no evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, the moving party may prevail simply by "pointing out to the district court . . . that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Conversely, the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts . . . ." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Even so, in this circuit "as a general matter, the plaintiff in an employment discrimination action need produce very little evidence in order to overcome an employer's motion for summary judgment." Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trustees, 225 F.3d 1115, 1124 (9th Cir. 2000).

B. Application

1. Disability Discrimination

a. Applicable Law
Walker alleges that T-Mobile discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. In California, it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge a person from employment because of a physical or mental disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). Because direct evidence of discriminatory intent is rare, California courts utilize the three-part burden-shifting analysis outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). However, "[i]n an employment discrimination case, the employer, [*13]  as the moving party, has the initial burden to present admissible evidence showing either [1] that one or more elements of plaintiff's prima facie case is lacking or [2] that the adverse employment action was based upon legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors." Hicks v. KNTV Television, Inc., 160 Cal. App. 4th 994, 73 Cal. Rptr. 3d 240, 249 (Ct. App. 2008) (citations omitted). "If the employer meets its initial burden in this manner, the plaintiff then has the burden to produce 'substantial evidence that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual, or evidence the employer acted with a discriminatory animus, or a combination of the two, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer engaged in intentional discrimination.'" Id. (citing Hersant v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 57 Cal. App. 4th 997, 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d 483, 488 (Ct. App. 1997). "If plaintiff produces no evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could infer that the employer's true reason was discriminatory, the employer is entitled to summary judgment. Id. (citing Caldwell v. Paramount Unified Sch. Dist., 41 Cal. App. 4th 189, 48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 448, 457 (Ct. App. 1995)).,
Under California law, to state a prima facie case for disability discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must show: (1) he suffered from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability.9 Deschene v. Pinole Point Steel Co., 76 Cal. App. 4th 33, 90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 15, 23 (Ct. App. 1999). While the [*14]  plaintiff's prima facie burden is not onerous, he must at least show "actions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if such actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a [prohibited] discriminatory criterion . . . ." Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1113 (Cal. 2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted).

b. T-Mobile's Initial Burden
To satisfy its initial burden, T-Mobile must present admissible evidence that one or more elements of Walker's prima facie case is lacking or that the adverse employment action was based upon legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors. Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1063 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Johnson v. Nordstrom, Inc., 260 F.3d 727, 733-34 (7th Cir. 2001); Guz, 8 P.3d at 1115 ("if nondiscriminatory, . . . true reasons need not necessarily have been wise or correct").10 Defendant does not challenge Walker's ability to establish a prima facie case, but contends that the undisputed facts establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for the termination.
In this case, the June 30, 2008 letter from Ms. Pearse informed Walker that he was required to submit a return to work doctor's note by July 16, 2008 and to actually return to work by July 20, 2008. However, the undisputed facts establish that Walker failed to comply with both of these deadlines. Walker's failure to meet these deadlines, [*15]  and his subsequent failure to respond to T-Mobile's attempts to contact him, serve as a legitimate reason for termination. In fact, Walker concedes that he was required to return to work on July 20, 2008, but failed to do so. (SGI ¶¶ 17, 28.) T-Mobile's decision to terminate Walker's employment for these reasons demonstrates a legitimate and nondiscriminatory purpose.

c. Walker's Burden: "Substantial Evidence" of Discrimination
As T-Mobile has met its burden by articulating a legitimate reason for termination, Plaintiff must present "specific, substantial evidence of pretext" to avoid summary judgment. Id. (citation omitted); Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal Inc., 292 F.3d 654, 659 (9th Cir. 2002); King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 358, 366 (2007) (citation omitted).
The record contains evidence that, although Walker had a return date of July 20, 2008, he was led to believe that T-Mobile maintained a 3-day no call/no show policy and reasonably assumed that T-Mobile would permit him to visit his doctor on July 21, 2008. After visiting his doctor, Walker received a doctor's note extending his leave to September 21, 2008. The record contains additional evidence that Walker then called Mr. Moreno and Ms. Pearse on July 22 and July 25, respectively, and purportedly left messages for each of them explaining his [*16]  situation and requesting an extension for his disability.11 In short, the Court is presented with evidence that T-Mobile did not decide to terminate Walker until after Ms. Ruse attempted to contact Walker on July 29 and July 30, when T-Mobile was aware that Walker remained disabled, and had requested an extension for disability leave. This evidence permits a rational inference that the basis for T-Mobile's termination decision was due to Walker's disability. Therefore, summary judgment as to this claim is DENIED.

2. Failure to Accommodate/Failure to Engage in Interactive Process
In California, it is an unlawful practice for an employer to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an employee unless doing so would impose an undue hardship. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). To establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must allege facts that show that the employer failed to accommodate the plaintiff's known disability. Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440, 453 (Ct. App. 2008). California Government Code § 12940(n) also provides that it is an unlawful practice for an employer to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee to determine reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation [*17]  with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n).
In this case, Walker bases his claim on the statutory rules regarding the failure to accommodate and the failure to engage in the interactive process. Under California law:
Two principles underlie a cause of action for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. First, the employee must request an accommodation. [Citation.] Second, the parties must engage in an interactive process regarding the requested accommodation and, if the process fails, responsibility for the failure rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith. [Citation.] While a claim of failure to accommodate is independent of a cause of action for failure to engage in an interactive dialogue, each necessarily implicates the other.
Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874, 890 (Ct. App. 2006).
When an employee requests a leave of absence due to medical disability, "a finite leave can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA, provided it is likely that at the end of the leave, the employee would be able to perform his or her duties." Hanson, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 494. "Holding a job open for a disabled employee who needs time to recuperate or heal is in itself a form of reasonable accommodation and may be all that is required [*18]  where it appears likely that the employee will be able to return to an existing position at some time in the foreseeable future." Claudio v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 134 Cal. App. 4th 224, 35 Cal. Rptr. 3d 837, 852 (Ct. App. 2005). "Reasonable accommodation does not require the employer to wait indefinitely for an employee's medical condition to be corrected." Hanson, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 494 (citation omitted). An employer can prevail on summary judgment on a claim of failure to accommodate if it establishes that "the employer did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussion in good faith. Claudio, 35 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 851-52 (citing Jensen, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 68).
According to T-Mobile's June 30, 2008 letter, Walker was required to return to work on July 20, 2008. (Walker Decl., Ex. 4.) When he failed to show up for work, T-Mobile decided to terminate Walker based on its conclusion that Walker was requesting an indefinite leave of absence, which does not constitute a reasonable accommodation. T-Mobile further aruges that Plaintiff "dropped the ball" and failed to communicate with T-Mobile personnel after he failed to show up to work on July 20, 2008. (Mem. at 15.) T-Mobile contends that Ms. Ruse attempted to contact Plaintiff on five separate occasions (4 phone [*19]  calls, 1 email) on July 29, 2008 and July 30, 2008. Walker's failure to respond to any of these communications caused the interactive process to break down, and demonstrates that Walker, not T-Mobile, failed to engage in discussions in good faith.
T-Mobile's argument ignores the finite duration of the doctor's certification of disability, and fails to account for Walker's evidence that he placed calls on July 22 and July 25 which clearly indicate that he remained engaged in the interactive process. Further, Walker requested a finite leave of absence, which T-Mobile concedes it would have granted had Walker requested one on July 25, 2008. (Pl.'s Lodging of Evidence, Ex. A [Ruse Depo 122-23].) Walker's evidence regarding his calls to T-Mobile before T-Mobile attempted to reach him creates a genuine issue of material fact as to his continued good faith participation in the interactive process. His evidence, which the Court must assume as true in the present proceeding, indicates that T-Mobile was aware that he continued to be disabled, was aware that the disability and the request for accommodation were finite, and that Walker was engaged in the interactive process. Whether or not Walker [*20]  was responsible for the breakdown in communication is a matter that must be resolved at trial by the trier of fact. T-Mobile's summary judgment motion with regard to this claim is DENIED.

3. Retaliation
To state a prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA, a plaintiff must show: (1) he engaged in a "protected activity"; (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action. Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123, 1130 (Cal. 2005) (citations omitted). "The casual link may be established by an inference derived from circumstantial evidence, 'such as the employer's knowledge that the [employee] engaged in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected action and the allegedly retaliatory employment decision.'" Jordan v. Clark, 847 F.2d 1368, 1376 (9th Cir. 1988) (citations omitted). "Once an employee establishes a prima facie case, the employer is required to offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Yanowitz, 116 P.3d at 1130 (citing Morgan v. Regents of University of California, 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652, 665 (Ct. App. 2000). "If the employer produces a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, the presumption of retaliation 'drops out of the picture,' and the burden shifts back to the employee to prove intentional retaliation." Id. (citing [*21]  Morgan, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 665.)
Walker contends that he was retaliated against for requesting a reasonable accommodation for his disability. (Opp. at 22.) The causal link between the employee's participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment action may be satisfied by reference to the temporal proximity between the activity and the termination. King v. Preferred Technical Group, 166 F.3d 887, 893 (7th Cir. 1999); Gleklen v. Democratic Congressional Campaign Comm., Inc., 199 F.3d 1365, 1368, 339 U.S. App. D.C. 354 (D.C. Cir. 2000) ("Temporal proximity is often found sufficient to establish the requisite causal connection for such claims."). Here, Walker made his requests for accommodation on July 22, 2008 and July 25, 2008, and was ultimately terminated on or after July 31, 2008. The fact that these two events occurred so close in time suggests that Walker was terminated because of his request for an additional extension of leave. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Walker, it appears as though there is a clear possibility that T-Mobile fired him because he repeatedly requested, and was granted, disability leave. On that ground, the Court DENIES T-Mobile's motion for summary judgment as to Walker's retaliation claim.

4. Punitive Damages
Punitive damages are available under Cal. Civ. Code § 3294 "where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, [*22]  fraud, or malice . . . ." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a). For the reasons discussed above, the Court concludes that it cannot summarily adjudicate the request for punitive damages.
