Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This is an employment discrimination case, presently before the Court on Plaintiff Heather Connelly's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Doc. 38] and Defendant Wellstar Health System, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 39]. For the reasons discussed below, I RECOMMEND that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED and that Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment be DENIED AS MOOT.

I. BACKGROUND

A. Preliminary Considerations
I draw many of the facts from the uncontested portions of Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts ("DSMF") [Doc. 39-2] and Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Undisputed Facts ("PSAF") [Doc. 45-2]. I have also considered Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts ("R-DSMF") [Doc. 45-1] and Defendant's Response [*2]  and Objections to Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Undisputed Facts ("R-PSAF") [Doc. 50]. In addition, even though I recommend that Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment be denied as moot, I have also considered Plaintiff's Undisputed Material Facts in Support of her Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Doc. 38-9] and Defendant's responses and objections thereto [Doc. 43].
Where the party responding to a statement has neither refuted nor stated valid objections to the material facts as set forth in the statement, those facts are deemed admitted by operation of law. LR 56.1B(2), NDGa.; Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1267-69 (11th Cir. 2008). In those instances where a party denies a statement of fact (in whole or in part), I have reviewed the record to determine whether it is disputed and, if so, whether any dispute is material. Contested facts are presented in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. I have also excluded assertions of fact by either party that are immaterial or presented as arguments or legal conclusions, and have excluded assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to evidence in the record, stated as a legal conclusion, or asserted only in the party's brief and not the statement of facts. See LR 56.1B(1), NDGa. Finally, [*3]  I include some facts drawn from my own review of the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).

B. Factual Background

1. Plaintiff's Employment
Defendant is a system of hospitals and other health care facilities. (DSMF ¶ 1; R-DSMF ¶ 1.) In January 2010, Defendant hired Plaintiff as a Medical Assistant in the Kennestone OB/GYN practice group. (DSMF ¶ 2; R-DSMF ¶ 2.) The Kennestone OB/GYN practice group has three locations: Marietta, Towne Lake and Acworth. (DSMF ¶ 3; R-DSMF ¶ 3.) Plaintiff was initially hired to work at the Marietta location. (DSMF ¶ 10; R-DSMF ¶ 10.) In 2015, at Plaintiff's request, Plaintiff was reassigned assigned to the Towne Lake location, but also worked at the other locations as needed. (DSMF ¶¶ 4, 10; R-DSMF ¶¶ 4, 10.)
During her employment, Plaintiff reported to Office Manager Melissa Terry and Clinical Supervisors Elizabeth Chamblee and Victoria Plyler. (DSMF ¶¶ 5-7; R-DSMF ¶¶ 5-7.) Plaintiff's job duties included "working up" patients in preparation for physician encounters, which included recording patient medical history, taking vital signs, obtaining blood samples, and administering shots. (DSMF ¶ 8; R-DSMF ¶ 8.) She took this information so that physicians could rely on it to help expedite [*4]  their visits with the patients. (R-DSMF ¶ 9.)

2. The April 15 Incident
Plaintiff suffers from depression and depressive disorder, which the parties agree for purposes of the pending motions is a disability under the ADA, and that Defendant was aware of it. [See Doc. 44 at 2 ("Defendant acknowledges that Plaintiff has a disability . . . ."); Doc. 43 at 3 (admitting that Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff has a disability).] It is also undisputed that Defendant has been aware of Plaintiff's condition since at least 2013. (DSMF ¶¶ 11-14; R-DSMF ¶¶ 11-14; Dep. of Pl. [Doc. 37] at 61.) Since at least 2014, Terry, Chamblee, and Plyler observed instances where Plaintiff would act emotionally at work. (DSMF ¶¶ 23-25; R-DSMF ¶¶ 23-25.)
On April 15, 2015, Plaintiff suffered an episode at work. Plaintiff admits that she was emotional and depressed, but testified that she did not feel like she needed to go home that day. (DSMF ¶ 19; R-DSMF ¶ 19.) Regardless, Plyler testified that she did not think Plaintiff was not in a state of mind that allowed her to work that day and asked her to leave work; after initially refusing to leave, Plaintiff eventually left. (Decl. of Plyler [Doc. 39-5] ¶ 3; DSMF ¶ 19.) Plaintiff testified [*5]  that she did not wish to leave because she did not want to receive an infraction for missing work. (Id.; Dep. of Pl. at 65.)
At Plyler's request, Jennifer Wilson, a nurse who observed Plaintiff's behavior, memorialized her observations of Plaintiff in an email. (DSMF ¶ 20; RDSMF ¶ 20.) Wilson described Plaintiff as:
Pale, very tearful, her eyes were glassy. She had a wild look out of her eyes . . . she seemed very paranoid, almost like having a psychotic episode. I have seen [Plaintiff] emotional in the past but I have never seen her look or act like she did this morning. I am very concerned for both her emotional and physical wellbeing. She seemed very emotional [sic] unstable. I was concern[ed] about her driving after she left the office. I am concerned she may harm herself.
(DSMF ¶ 21.1) Plyler forwarded this e-mail to Terry and Chamblee "so that they would be aware of Ms. Wilson's description of Ms. Connelly's state of mind that day." (R-DSMF ¶ 22.)
After Plaintiff left the office, Assistant Vice President of Human Resources Joey Hunt became aware of the incident. (DSMF ¶ 28; R-DSMF ¶ 28.) Hunt felt that the situation should have been handled differently. Hunt believed, based on [*6]  Plaintiff's behavior as it was related to him, that Plyler should not have directed Plaintiff to leave work until Human Resources could assist in assessing whether the situation warranted a drug test under Defendant's Drug Testing Policy and ensure that Plaintiff was provided a ride home so that she would not drive home in an impaired state. (DSMF ¶ 29.2) Lauri Beamish, the Director over Kennestone OB/GYN and Terry's immediate supervisor, told Terry and Plyler that, if a similar situation occurred in the future, they should not instruct Plaintiff to leave work until they were able to confer with Human Resources. (DSMF ¶ 31.3)

3. Plaintiff Takes FMLA Leave
After Plaintiff was sent home from work on April l5, 2015, she saw her doctor, Dr. Ebon Bourne. (DSMF ¶ 32; R-DSMF ¶ 32.) Dr. Bourne placed a legal hold on her because he felt that she was a danger to herself, and a Sheriff's Deputy drove Plaintiff to Peachford Hospital for mental health treatment. (DSMF ¶ 33; RDSMF ¶ 33.) Plaintiff remained at Peachford until April 20, 2015. (DSMF ¶ 34; R-DSMF ¶ 34.)
Dr. Bourne completed FMLA paperwork indicating that Plaintiff needed to be on FMLA leave starting April 15, 2015, and ending on June [*7]  1, 2015. (DSMF ¶ 35 R-DSMF ¶ 35.) Defendant approved the request. (DSMF ¶ 36; R-DSMF ¶ 36; PSAF ¶ 1; R-PSAF ¶ 1.) Her FMLA leave was later extended until June 15, 2015, due to an unrelated surgery. (DSMF ¶ 37; R-DSMF ¶ 37.) She was released to return to work on June 15, 2015, with no restrictions. (DSMF ¶ 38; R-DSMF ¶ 38.)

4. Plaintiff Returns to Work
Plaintiff returned to work on June 15, 2015. (Dep. of Melissa Terry [Doc. 33] at 117.) On the morning of June 15, Plaintiff met with Hunt, Terry, and Chamblee to discuss Defendant's expectations for Plaintiff's job performance upon her return. (DSMF ¶¶ 39-40; R-DSMF ¶¶ 39-40; PSAF ¶ 16; R-PSAF ¶ 16.) Defendant contends that Hunt felt that it was important to meet with Plaintiff when she returned from leave to emphasize that she could not again report to work in an impaired state. (DSMF ¶ 39; Decl. of Hunt [Doc. 39-4] ¶ 4.4) During the meeting, Plaintiff indicated that she was ready to return to work, and after the meeting ended, she returned to the Towne Lake office. (DSMF ¶¶ 41-42; R-DSMF ¶¶ 41-42.) Plaintiff worked between June 15, 2015, and June 22, 2015, and during that period, Defendant had no concerns about her behavior or performance. (PSAF ¶ 2; RPSAF ¶ 2.)

5. The [*8]  June 22, 2015 Incident
On June 22, 2015, Plaintiff reported to work at around 1:00 p.m.5 (DSMF ¶¶ 42-43; R-DSMF ¶¶ 42-43.) Within about an hour of reporting to work, after she had seen at least two patients, Chamblee asked Plaintiff to meet with her in a break room. (DSMF ¶ 44; R-DSMF ¶ 44; Pl. Dep. at 106.) Plyler was in the break room as well. (Pl.'s Dep. at 107). After Plaintiff came to the break room, Chamblee handed her a piece of paper with notes from a staff meeting held earlier that day that Plaintiff had missed. (Id. at 106-07.) Chamblee also told Plaintiff that Plaintiff had incorrectly noted on a patient's chart earlier that day that the patient was diabetic, but explained in her deposition that she did not asked Plaintiff to meet regarding the notation. (Chamblee Dep. at 111-12.) Plaintiff was "upset and crying and just acting very odd," so either Chamblee or Plyler contacted Human Resources so that Human Resources could observe her behavior. (Id.; see also Pl.'s Dep. at 109; R-DSMF ¶ 44.)
While they were waiting on someone from Human Resources to arrive, Chamblee and Plyler talked with Plaintiff in the break room. (DSMF ¶ 476; Pl. Dep. at 107.) Chamblee described Plaintiff as being "glassy-eyed" [*9]  with a "like nobody-was-home sort of stare." (Chamblee Dep. at 101.) "[Plaintiff] would say things that wouldn't make sense, and she would start to tell [Chamblee] something, and then she would just like stop and stare at [Chamblee] like she completely forgot her train of thought . . . ." (Id.) Chamblee stated that Plaintiff was not speaking in complete sentences, was not coherent, and was not reasonable. (Id. at 102.) Chamblee felt that "this was again another emotional outburst, but this one was so much more severe than the ones that she's had in the past with just the intensity and the — just not in her mind and I really did feel like she was — she was breaking. She was snapping." (Id. at 103-04.)
Plyler similarly described Plaintiff as unable to focus, "spacy," unable to keep eye contact, unable to complete or coherent sentences, and that "there was no . . . real communication with her." (DSMF ¶ 49; R-DSMF ¶ 49.)
Senior Human Resources Consultant Meili Villalba then arrived at the office. (Chamblee Dep. at 101-02; Dep. of Meili Villalba [Doc. 32] at 63.) She interacted with Plaintiff for around ten minutes and found that Plaintiff was "slurring her speech" and "having a hard time staying on topic" when responding to questions. (DSMF ¶ 50; [*10]  R-DSMF ¶ 50; PSAF ¶ 4; R-PSAF ¶ 4.) According to Villalba, Plaintiff was "[t]aking a long time to respond," appeared "very mellow," and seemed to have a difficult time understanding the conversation. (DSMF ¶ 50; RDSMF ¶ 50; PSAF ¶ 4; R-PSAF ¶ 4.) Villalba told Plaintiff that based on what she witnessed, Plaintiff would be directed to submit a drug test. (Villalba Dep. at 82; see also Villalba Dep. at 67-71 (describing what she witnessed, including slurred speech, slow responses, and an inability to stay on topic).) Plaintiff agreed to do so. (DSMF ¶ 52; R-DSMF ¶ 52.) Once the test was completed, Villalba arranged for a cab to take Plaintiff home, at Defendant's expense. (DSMF ¶ 53; R-DSMF ¶ 53.) Plaintiff was placed on administrative leave without pay at that time, pending the results of the drug test. (PSAF ¶ 6; R-PSAF ¶ 6.)
The drug test was negative for illegal drugs, but was positive for certain opiates, including codeine and morphine. (DSMF ¶ 54.7) As it turns out, on June 21, 2015, the day before the incident, Plaintiff went to the doctor for a migraine headache and she was prescribed Zofran and Fioricit with codeine. (DSMF ¶ 55; R-DSMF ¶ 55.) Defendant's Chief Medical Officer, [*11]  Dr. Rodger Chapman, reviewed the drug test results and, in a July 2, 2017 email to Villalba, advised that Plaintiff's prescription medication was a legitimate medical explanation for the opiates that were reported in the results. (DSMF ¶ 56; R-DSMF ¶ 56; PSAF ¶ 7; R-PSAF ¶ 7; Hunt Dep. Ex. 21 [Doc. 34-1 at 18].) Dr. Chapman did not specifically determine, however, that Plaintiff was "unsafe for the workplace" while reviewing the test results. (PSAF ¶ 27; R-PSAF ¶ 27; Dep. of Hunt at 321-22, Ex. 21.) Nor, in relation to Defendants decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment, did Dr. Chapman or any other medical professional advise that the prescription medication found in Plaintiff's drug test results could cause the alleged behaviors witnessed, such as slurred speech, lethargy, and/or slow cognitive processes. (PSAF ¶ 32; R-PSAF ¶ 32; Dep. of Hunt 327-29 ("No physician advised on the termination.").)
After receiving Dr. Chapman's results, Villalba, Terry, and Hunt "reviewed the circumstances" of Plaintiff's episode. (Villalba Dep. at 95.) According to Villalba, it was obvious to her that Plaintiff reported to work in an impaired state and was unable to perform her job. (Id. at 102-04.) Villalba [*12]  testified that Plaintiff's employment was terminated because she reported to work in an impaired state without previously disclosing that she was taking a prescribed medication that could impair her ability to work. (Id. at 104, 114, 120.) Villalba further testified that this constituted a violation of Policy 7002, which pertinently provides that an employee must disclose the use of a prescription medication that may impair her ability to work. (Id. at 120-21; see also Villalba Dep. Ex. 6 [Doc. 32-1 at 34] (Employee Conference/Counseling Report including Policy 7002).) Terry testified that the decision to terminate Plaintiff was an "HR-driven decision" and that she did not play a decision-making role in terminating Plaintiff's employment. (Terry Dep. at 151.) Nonetheless, Terry was principally concerned that Plaintiff posed a danger to the safety of patients, as Plaintiff was "obviously had something in her system that was impairing her ability to do her job." (Id. at 151, 155-56.) Hunt testified that he believed that the drug test results validated that Plaintiff's behavior on June 22 was the result of the medication that she had taken. (Hunt Dep. at 331-32.)
On July 7, 2015, Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment. (PSAF ¶ 8; [*13]  R-PSAF ¶ 8.) Terry informed Plaintiff of the decision and provided Plaintiff with an Employee Conference/Counseling Report, which stated as follows:
On June 15, 2015, we met to discuss expectations upon your return to work. This meeting addressed a previous incident in which you were visibly impaired and previous behavior that were not appropriate. You confirmed that you were not on any medications that have side effects that would make you impaired. You stated that you understood the expectations discussed.
On June 22, 2015, you reported to work impaired. This is in violation of Wellstar Policy 7002 — Drug Free Workplace Plan. The policy states the following:
Policy 7002: Individuals who are taking prescribed medications are responsible for being aware of any effect such medication(s) can have on their ability to perform their, job duties and should report to their supervisor the use of any medication which might affect job performance before job performance is actually impaired. For purposes of this policy, employees who report to work or perform work while impaired due to the influence of a prescribed medication, the use of which has not been reported previously, will be treated as [*14]  having reported to work impaired or under the influence of a drug, and thus [in] violation of the plan.
Due to your violation of this policy, you are hereby being terminated effective immediately from Wellstar Kennestone OB/GYN.
(DSMF ¶ 68; R-DSMF ¶ 68; Villalba Dep. Ex. 6.)
Additional facts are discussed below in context as necessary.

C. Procedural Background
In July 2016, Plaintiff filed a four-count complaint against Defendant. [Doc. 1.] In Count One, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the FMLA by terminating her in retaliation for exercising her rights to protected medical leave pursuant to the FMLA. [Id. at 11-13.] In Count Two, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant terminated her employment in violation of the ADA. [Id. at 13-17.] In Count Three, she alleges that Defendant violated the ADA by failing to accommodate her disability. [Id. at 17-20.] In Count Four, she alleges that Defendant retaliated against her in violation of the ADA for requesting reasonable accommodations. [Id. at 21-24.]
On July 28, 2017, Defendant moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims. [Doc. 39.] Plaintiff has filed a response to the motion [Doc. 45], and Defendant has filed a reply [Doc. 48]. Also on July 28, Plaintiff moved for partial [*15]  summary judgment regarding four discrete issues: (1) that she has a disability under the ADA; (2) that Defendant cannot meet its burden to show that Plaintiff failed to mitigate its damages; (3) that Defendant cannot meet its burden to demonstrate that Plaintiff's termination was justified by after-acquired evidence; and (4) that Defendant may not reduce Plaintiff's damages by the amount of any collateral benefits she received. [Doc. 38-1.] Defendant has filed a response to Plaintiff's motion [Doc. 44], and Plaintiff has filed a reply [Doc. 47].
For the reasons that follow, I recommend that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted. I therefore further recommend that Plaintiff's cross-motion for partial summary judgment be denied as moot.

II. Discussion

A. Summary Judgment Standard
A court should grant summary judgment when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears the initial burden of showing that it is entitled to summary judgment. Id. ("The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment [*16]  as a matter of law."); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) ("Of course, a party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact."); Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991) (holding that Celotex did not change the rule that the movant bore the initial burden, and stating, "Even after Celotex it is never enough simply to state that the non-moving party cannot meet its burden at trial"). The movant may carry its burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the non[-]moving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325.
"Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the nonmoving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark, 929 F.2d at 608. The non-movant is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, answers to interrogatories, depositions, admissions and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (quotation omitted); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "[M]ere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient [*17]  to defeat a summary judgment motion." Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005). Resolving all doubts in favor of the non-moving party, the court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). In evaluating a summary judgment motion, "[t]he evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [the non-movant's] favor. Id. at 255.

B. FMLA and ADA Retaliation Claims
In her retaliation claims under the FMLA and the ADA, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant retaliated against her for using leave, which is protected activity under the FMLA and an exercise of her rights to an accommodation under the ADA. [Doc. 45 at 5, 23-34.] Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation since any causal connection established by the temporal proximity between her taking FMLA leave and her termination was broken by her workplace misconduct, showing up to work in an impaired state; moreover, Defendant argues that that same misconduct constitutes its legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for her discharge and that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that Defendant's reason for firing her was pretextual. [Doc. 39-1 at 5-15.]
Under [*18]  the FMLA, an eligible employee is entitled to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period because of, inter alia, a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of her position. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). After taking FMLA leave, a person is entitled to restoration of her position or an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. Id. § 2614(a)(1).
The FMLA creates two types of claims to protect these rights: (1) interference claims, where the employee asserts that her employer denied or otherwise interfered with her substantive rights under the FMLA, and (2) retaliation claims, where the employee asserts that her employer discriminated against her because she engaged in statutorily protected activity. Jones v. Gulf Coast Health Care of Del., LLC, 854 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2017) (quoting Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001)). To state a claim of FMLA retaliation, an employee must demonstrate that the employer "intentionally discriminated against [her] in the form of an adverse employment action for having exercised an FMLA right." Id. at 1270 (citation omitted). "In other words, [the employee] must show that [her] employer's actions were motivated by an impermissible retaliatory or discriminatory animus." Id. (citation and quotation marks [*19]  omitted). Similarly, the ADA makes it unlawful to discriminate against an individual for opposing any act or practice made illegal under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a); Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997).
In evaluating an FMLA or ADA retaliation claim, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, courts use the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Jones, 854 F.3d at 1271 (FMLA); Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287 (ADA). A prima facie case of retaliation requires a showing that the employee engaged in statutorily protected conduct, the employee suffered an adverse employment action, and there is a causal connection between the two. Jones, 854 F.3d at 1271. Smith, 273 F.3d at 1314. A plaintiff can show a causal connection by showing that the decisionmaker was aware of the protected conduct and that the protected activity and adverse employment action were close in time. Brungart, 231 F.3d at 799. For purposes of FMLA retaliation claims, temporal proximity is measured from the last day of an employee's FMLA leave until the adverse employment action occurs. Jones, 854 F.3d at 1272.
If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Jones, 854 F.3d at 1271; see also Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004). If the defendant does so, the plaintiff must show that the proffered reason is pretextual. Id. A plaintiff shows [*20]  pretext by showing "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in [defendant's] proffered legitimate reasons for its actions that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Grp., Inc., 509 F.3d 1344, 1348 (11th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted).
Defendant's initial argument that Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie FMLA or ADA retaliation case because she engaged in intervening misconduct by coming to work in an impaired state is better addressed at the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason and pretext stages because it involves an analysis of why Defendant's suspended her without pay and terminated her employment. See Griffin v. City of Demorest, 635 F. App'x 701, 706 n.3 (11th Cir. 2015) (addressing at pretext stage employer's argument that intervening investigation severed causal connection); see also Baldelamar v. Jefferson S. Corp., No. 4:15-CV-209-HLMWEJ, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193877, 2016 WL 9330869, at *15 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 13, 2016) (citing Griffin), report and recommendation adopted, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193878, 2016 WL 9331114 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 5, 2016). Accordingly, for purposes of this analysis, I assume without deciding that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of FMLA and ADA retaliation.
Defendant has discharged its burden at the next stage, having presented evidence that Plaintiff was suspended and terminated from employment because she reported to work in an impaired [*21]  state on June 22, 2015. (Villalba Dep. at 104.) Accordingly, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to show that Defendant's reason for terminating her employment is pretext for retaliation. See Cleveland, 369 F.3d at 1193.
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's reason for terminating her employment is pretextual because the decisionmakers had no objective, medical evidence that Plaintiff's impairment was caused by her medication. [Doc. 45 at 7.] This argument is not persuasive. When an employer asserts that it has fired an employee based on reported workplace incidents, the employee must not only dispute that those incidents occurred, but also call into question the employer's sincere belief that they occurred. Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., 408 F.3d 763, 771 (11th Cir. 2005); Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1471 (11th Cir. 1991). "If the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, a plaintiff cannot recast the reason but must meet it head on and rebut it. Quarreling with that reason is not sufficient." Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1088 (11th Cir. 2004) (internal citations omitted). The Eleventh Circuit has held:
If an employer discharges an individual under an honest belief pursuant to the information available to the employer that the employee has violated a policy of the employer, the fact that the employer's belief may be mistaken or wrong in fact does not [*22]  mean that such belief cannot constitute a legitimate reason for the employer's discharge of the plaintiff.
Smith v. PAPP Clinic, P.A., 808 F.2d 1449, 1452 (11th Cir. 1987).
There is no genuine dispute that Defendants terminated because the decisionmakers honestly believed that Plaintiff violated the substance use policy by not reporting the potential side effects of her medications and coming to work in an impaired state. As noted above, there is no dispute that (1) Plaintiff was prescribed medicine with codeine on July 21, 2015, (2) she took the medicine on July 21, (3) the next day she came to work without reporting that she had taken the medication, (4) Plaintiff was in an impaired state when she came to work, (5) Plaintiff submitted to a drug test, and (6) the drug test indicated that Plaintiff reported positive for opiates. It is also undisputed that Defendant's policy provides in relevant part that an employee who is prescribed medication is responsible for being aware of any effect that the medication may have on her ability to perform her job, and should report use of any medication before job performance is actually impaired. (Hunt Dep. Ex. 20 at 10 [Doc. 34-1 at 11].) Under the policy, an employee who reports to work or performs work while [*23]  impaired due to prescribed medication that was not reported is treated as having reported to work impaired or under the influence of a drug, and is subject to discipline, including the termination of her employment. (Id.)
Plaintiff also takes issue with Defendant's contention that that she could not perform the duties of her job on June 22 or that her behavior actually posed a danger to patient safety. Plaintiff specifically argues that Terry's testimony that she was concerned that Plaintiff's behavior endangered the safety of patients is "groundless" because Terry did not witness the June 22 incident and could give no specific examples as to how Plaintiff's behavior compromised patient safety. [Doc. 45 at 8.] This assertion is inaccurate. Terry in fact testified that Plaintiff incorrectly charted a patient as diabetic, which caused Terry to be concerned for patient safety. (Terry Dep. at 152.) The fact that Terry did not personally witness the charting error is of no moment.
Plaintiff's assertion—that Terry could not give any example of how Plaintiff's conduct could have posed a threat to patient safety—is based on a separate line of questioning at Terry's deposition regarding additional [*24]  concerns Terry identified. Plaintiff's counsel asked Terry to identify specific risks that Plaintiff posed to patient safety beyond the charting error example, and Terry responded "[d]elayed care, judgment, communication." (Id. at 156.) Then counsel asked Terry if it was correct that Terry did not know whether there was, in fact a delay, or the extent of any delay because Terry was not present while Plaintiff was working up patients. (Id. at 159.) Terry responded "That's fair." (Id.) Plaintiff cites only this final line of questioning in her brief, ignoring Terry's earlier testimony. (Id.) In sum, the record contradicts Plaintiff's assertion that Terry gave no specific examples as to how patient safety was compromised.8
Plaintiff next argues that she did not violate Defendant's drug use policy. [Doc. 45 at 9-10.] The policy states in pertinent part that employees "should report to their supervisor the use of any medication which might affect job performance before job performance is actually impaired." (Hunt Dep. Ex. 20 at 10 [Doc. 34-1 at 10].) Plaintiff argues that this language obligates an employee to report the use of prescription medication if she believes that the medication might affect job performance. [*25]  Citing Terry's deposition testimony, Plaintiff asserts that Terry "admits that [Plaintiff] did not believe the medication she was on would impair her ability to do her job." [Id. (citing Terry Dep. at 121, 143).] Plaintiff further points out that when she returned from medical leave, she reported to her manager what medications she was on. [Id.]
These arguments are also without merit. First, Plaintiff's assertion that Terry "admitted" that Plaintiff did not believe her prescription drugs would impair her job performance is not accurate. Terry actually testified that during the June 15 meeting (the meeting when Plaintiff first returned from medical leave) she asked Plaintiff if she felt that medications would at all impair her ability to do her job, and Plaintiff indicated that "nothing that she was taking should impair her ability to do her job." (Terry Dep. at 121.) Terry's testimony was not an "admission"; rather, Terry simply recounted what Plaintiff told her at that meeting. More fundamentally, the fact that Plaintiff disclosed her medications at that time and stated that she felt the medications did not impair her ability to perform her job is not evidence of pretext, because it [*26]  was only after the June 15 meeting that Plaintiff was prescribed and took Zofran or Fioricit with codeine, and there is no evidence suggesting that Plaintiff reported her use of those medications to Defendant prior to the June 22 incident. (See Pl. Dep. at 116-18.)
Plaintiff also challenges Defendant's assumption that the prescription drugs were the cause of her behavior on June 22. She argues that the behavior that Villalba witnessed—including slurred speech, lethargy, and inability to stay on topic—were caused by her disability because those symptoms were "virtually identical" to behavior that Chamblee described witnessing when Plaintiff became emotional as a result of her depression. [Doc. 45 at 9.] According to Plaintiff, a jury could reasonably conclude that the similarities between what Villalba saw on June 22, and what Chamblee had seen in the past meant that Villalba was actually witnessing the symptoms of depression rather than the effects of medication. [Id.] Along these lines, Plaintiff also argues that no doctor opined that the prescribed medication found in the drug test results could have caused her conduct on June 22. [Id. at 10-11.] She points out that Dr. Chapman simply identified [*27]  the presence of drugs in Plaintiff's system, but said nothing about the effect of the drugs on her behavior. [Id. at 10 (citing Hunt Dep. Ex. 21 at 18 [Doc. 34-1 at 18]).]
While it is possible that Villalba, Hunt, and Terry could have reasonably concluded that Plaintiff's behavior on June 22 was caused by her depressive disorder9 (rather than the medication she took the day before), Plaintiff's argument does not attack the reasonableness of their stated beliefs or conclusions. Simply showing that it is possible that a decisionmaker could come to a different conclusion is not enough to demonstrate pretext. Plaintiff does not point to evidence that suggests that Villalba, Hunt, or Terry, whom Plaintiff contends were the decisionmakers with regard to her suspension and discharge, did not honestly believe that Plaintiff was under the influence of drugs that day. Nor is there any real dispute that Plaintiff, in fact, had opiates in her system that she had not disclosed to Defendant.10
Furthermore, although Plaintiff is correct that no medical professional ruled out that her impairment was not due to drugs, she points to no evidence that suggests that opiates in her system could not have caused her behavior [*28]  that day such that the decisionmakers could not have honestly believed that she was under the influence of an undisclosed prescription medication. In any event, it does not matter whether Plaintiff's behavior on June 22 was in fact caused by her disability or instead by her use of an undisclosed prescribed medication, as "the ADA does not insulate emotional or violent outbursts blamed on impairment." Hamilton v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 136 F.3d 1047, 1052 (5th Cir. 1998) (holding employer not liable for firing employee with posttraumatic stress disorder because of emotional outburst directed at a manager); see also Pernice v. City of Chicago, 237 F.3d 783, 785 (7th Cir. 2001) ("It is well-established that an employee can be terminated for violations of valid work rules that apply to all employees, even if the employee's violations occurred under the influence of a disability."); Jones v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 192 F.3d 417, 429 (4th Cir. 1999) (same); Ray v. Kroger Co., 264 F. Supp. 2d 1221, 1228 (S.D. Ga. 2003) ("[T]he law is well settled that the ADA is not violated when an employer discharges an individual based upon the employee's misconduct, even if the misconduct is related to a disability."), aff'd, 90 Fed. Appx. 384 (11th Cir. 2003). Ultimately, Plaintiff has not come forward with evidence that would allow a reasonable finder of fact to conclude that Defendant did not honestly believe that Plaintiff violated its policies by coming to work in an impaired state [*29]  after failing to disclose the use of prescription drugs that could cause an impairment.
Plaintiff's next argues that Defendant failed to follow its own drug testing policy, and that the failure demonstrates pretext. [Doc. 45 at 11-12.] Specifically, Plaintiff contends that there was never a determination of reasonable suspicion of drug use by any supervisor or Human Resources employee, instead, only "Villalba's uncorroborated observations which were virtually identical to symptoms of [Plaintiff's] disability." [Doc. 45 at 12.] She further contends that no written report or employee conference form was prepared that warranted a reasonable suspicion drug test. [Id. at 13.]
As a general matter, an employer's deviation from its own standard procedures may be evidence of pretext. See Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1299 (11th Cir. 2006). But not every deviation from a policy equates to pretext. Rather, "[t]o establish pretext, a plaintiff must show that the deviation from policy occurred in a discriminatory manner." Rojas v. Florida, 285 F.3d 1339, 1344 (11th Cir. 2002). In addition, minimal deviations from standard procedures generally are not evidence of pretext. Keaton v. Cobb Cty., No. 08-11220, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 1962, 2009 WL 212097, at *5 n.6 (11th Cir. Jan. 30, 2009).
The portion of the drug test policy that Plaintiff contends Defendant violated sets forth the procedures that employees should follow if they [*30]  suspect that a coworker is impaired by drug use. The policy provides that the supervisor should gather relevant facts, review them with a superior, and then prepare a report outlining the reasons why the employee should be drug tested.11 (Hunt Dep. Ex. 20 at 6 [Doc. 34-1 at 6].) The obvious purpose of this policy is to protect the rights of employees from groundless drug testing. Indeed, the policy cautions that "Although a request for reasonable suspicious testing does not require certainty, mere 'hunches' are not sufficient to meet this standard." (Id.)
To the extent that Defendant deviated from the procedure for ordering a drug test, it was not a substantive departure. The evidence is undisputed that that either Chamblee or Plyler contacted Human Resources for guidance after witnessing Plaintiff's behavior on June 22. In response, Villalba came to the office and, after interacting directly with Plaintiff, concluded that she would ask Plaintiff to submit to a drug test. (Villalba Dep. at 82.) Plaintiff expressly consented to submit to testing. (Id. at 84.) Even taking all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiff, it cannot be said that Defendant materially deviated from its procedure for determining whether to administer a drug test, such that the drug testing was pretext for retaliation.12
Plaintiff also argues that Defendant failed to follow its protocols by not providing Plaintiff a copy of the drug test results or notifying her that the drug test was positive for prescribed medication. [Doc. 45 at 13.] Specifically, Plaintiff points to a requirement that the supervisor complete an employee conference [*32]  form, which describes:
1. The type of behaviors or factors observed
2. Any witnesses to the behaviors
3. The reason for the referral
4. Actions taken
5. Employee's response.
(Hunt Dep. Ex. 20 at 5-6 [Doc. 34-1 at 5-6].) Plaintiff also points out that Policy 7006 also states an employee may dispute a positive test within 24 hours of being notified of the positive test. (Id. at 5.).
Assuming that Defendant was obligated to share the test results with Plaintiff, the failure to do so is not probative of pretext. The purpose of the foregoing provisions is to give an employee an opportunity to contest a false positive. Here, Plaintiff does not contend, much less proffer any evidence suggesting, that the drug test was inaccurate. To the extent that Defendant should have provided a copy of the results to Plaintiff, the violation is minimal and does not show pretext. Indeed, at her termination, Plaintiff was provided with an Employee Conference/Counseling Report that explained that she was being terminated because she reported to work in an impaired state and quoted the policy against reporting to work impaired. (Pl. Dep. at 112, Ex. 14 [Doc. 37-1 at 14].) Plaintiff did not dispute the results at that time. [*33]  As a result, the underlying purpose of the policy was preserved.
In sum, Plaintiff has not carried her burden to show that a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that Defendant's articulated reason for terminating her employment was a pretext for retaliation. Accordingly, I RECOMMEND Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's FMLA and ADA retaliation claims (Counts I and IV).

C. ADA Discrimination Claim (Count II)
The ADA, as amended by the ADAAA, prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). In evaluating disability discrimination cases based on circumstantial evidence, courts again apply the McDonnell Douglas threestep evidentiary framework discussed above. See Wascura v. City of S. Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001) ("[A] plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of an ADA violation through circumstantial evidence using the familiar burden-shifting analysis employed in Title VII employment discrimination cases.").
Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie [*34]  case by showing that: (1) she is disabled; (2) she was a "qualified individual" at the relevant time, meaning that she could perform the essential functions of the job in question with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (3) she suffered an adverse employment action in connection with her disability. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2001).13
After plaintiff makes that showing, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. After the defendant offers its reason, the presumption of discrimination is eliminated, and the plaintiff has the ultimate burden of proving intentional discrimination. Id. The plaintiff may do so by showing that the defendant's asserted reason is unworthy of credence and a pretext for discrimination. Id.
The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff can show that she is disabled and that she was a qualified individual. Defendant asserts, however, that Plaintiff cannot show that her disability played any role in the decision to terminate her employment. [Doc. 39-1 at 14.] Defendant points out that Plaintiff admits no one involved in the decision to terminate her employment made any negative comments [*35]  about her disability or that employees without disabilities who reported to work in an impaired state were treated more favorably. [Id.] Defendant additionally argues that Terry was aware for years that Plaintiff was disabled, "so it defies logic to infer that Terry would suddenly decide to discriminate against Plaintiff on that basis." [Id. at 15.] Defendant further argues that even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of discrimination, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that its reason for terminating her employment was pretext for discrimination. [Id.]
Plaintiff responds that she has established the third prong of her prima facie case because at the June 15, 2015 meeting, Hunt and Terry told Plaintiff that Defendant would not tolerate emotional outbursts in the future. [Doc. 45 at 17-18.] Plaintiff also points to a statement that Terry and another employee made to her in March 2015, that she could have no more emotional outbursts in the office, or else she would be deemed insubordinate and receive counseling. [Id. at 18.] According to Plaintiff, on June 22, "when she exhibited signs of her mental impairment," she was terminated for it. [Id.] As for pretext, Plaintiff incorporates her analysis [*36]  with respect to her FMLA retaliation claim.
In reply, Defendant argues that it need not excuse misconduct simply because it is the result of a disability. [Doc. 48 at 13.]
The Court need not belabor the issue of whether Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case because, as discussed above, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that Defendant's reason for terminating her employment was pretext. Accordingly, I RECOMMEND that Defendant's motion for summary judgment as it relates to Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim (Count II) be GRANTED.

D. ADA Failure to Accommodate Claim (Count III)
Under the ADA, an employer must make "reasonable accommodations" to an otherwise qualified employee with a disability "unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the employer." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255. "An accommodation is reasonable if it allows the disabled employee to perform the essential duties of the job in question." Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2016).
An employee has a corresponding responsibility to inform her employer that she needs an accommodation for her disability. Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 1999). An employer's duty to provide an accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation is made. Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1255-56. The ADA regulations contemplate that an employer and employee may need [*37]  to engage in an "interactive process" to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). Courts have held that an employer's duty to participate in the interactive process is not triggered unless the employee has made an adequate request for an accommodation, putting the employer on notice of the need for an accommodation. See E.E.O.C. v. C.R. England, Inc., 644 F.3d 1028, 1049 (10th Cir. 2011); Williams v. Clarke Cty. Dep't of Human Res., 834 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1320 (S.D. Ala. 2011).
In her complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability by (1) failing to allow her to have a pet as an emotional companion and (2) refusing to allow her to return to work while taking medication to treat her disability. [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 90, 91.] Defendant argues that neither of these proposals constitutes a reasonable accommodation. With respect to the request for a companion animal, Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not demand such an accommodation. [Doc. 39-1 at 16.] As to Plaintiff's request to take medication, Defendant argues that it did allow Plaintiff to take medicine, but that it did not allow her to take medicine that would impair her ability to work. [Id. at 16-17.] Defendant further argues that Defendant never requested an accommodation to take medicine that would cause her be impaired while at work. [Id.]
In her response, [*38]  Plaintiff does not address either of Defendant's arguments, but instead asserts a new theory of accommodation that was not in her Complaint. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that Defendant could have accommodated her with intermittent breaks or referral to behavioral health treatment or counseling through an Employee Assistance Program. [Doc. 45 at 20-21.] She further argues that "Defendant has not proven that [she] could not perform the essential job functions while being accommodated during her episodic mental impairments." [Id. at 21.] She asserts that "no one testified that she failed to perform he job functions prior to being placed in the break room" and there is a genuine dispute as to whether she made a charting error. [Id.] She further argues that she was "more than capable of returning to work after recovering," as she had done on previous occasions. [Id. at 22.]
In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to identify any accommodation that she requested that Defendant failed to provide. [Doc. 48 at 13-14.] Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's doctor cleared her to return to work with no restrictions just a week before the June 22 incident, and that Plaintiff affirmatively told Hunt, Terry, [*39]  and Chamblee during the June 15 meeting that she was ready to return to work. [Id. at 14-15.]
Defendant has the better argument here. There is no indication that Plaintiff requested any sort of accommodation after she returned to work with no restrictions on June 15, or even after the incident on June 22. As a result, she never put Defendant on notice that she sought or needed an accommodation to fulfill her essential job duties. Gaston, 167 F.3d at 1364. In addition, Plaintiff did not request to take any medical leave that Defendant did not allow her to take. (Pl. Dep. at 126.) On this record, Plaintiff has failed to come forward with evidence showing that Defendant failed to provide any reasonable accommodation to Plaintiff that she actually sought. See Capps v. Mondelez Glob., LLC, 847 F.3d 144, 157 (3d Cir. 2017) (holding that even assuming that request for FMLA leave also constituted a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, plaintiff failed to show that employer did not make a good faith effort to accommodate, where employer granted the request for leave). Accordingly, I RECOMMEND that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA reasonable accommodation claim (Count III).

III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, it is RECOMMENDED [*40]  that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 39] be GRANTED and that Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Doc. 38] be DENIED AS MOOT.
The Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate reference to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED, this 10th day of January, 2018.
