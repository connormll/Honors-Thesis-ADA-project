CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings: Order (1) GRANTING Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 24); and (2) VACATING the November 2, 2020 Hearing (IN CHAMBERS)
Before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(h)(3) filed by Defendant Coombe-Hesperia Road, LLC. ("Motion," Dkt. No. 24.) The Court determines this matter is appropriate for resolution without a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. After considering all papers filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion. The November 2, 2020 hearing is VACATED.

I. BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2020, Plaintiff David Lopez filed a complaint against Defendants Coombe-Hesperia Road, LLC and Does 1-100. ("Complaint," Dkt. No. 1.) The Complaint alleges two causes of action: (1) violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12181, et seq.; and (2) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act ("UCRA"), Cal. Civ. Code § 51, et seq. (See Complaint.)
On September 14, 2020, Defendant Coombe-Hesperia filed this Motion. (See Motion.) In support of the Motion, Defendant filed the Declaration of James S. Link ("Link Declaration," Dkt. No. [*2]  24-2), and Exhibits A (partial transcript of Defendant's deposition testimony) and B (map with directions from Plaintiff's residence to property in issue) ("Link Exhibit A," Dkt. No. 24-3; "Link Exhibit B," Dkt. No. 24-4). Plaintiff filed his Opposition on September 29, 2020. ("Opposition," Dkt. No. 26.) In support of his Opposition, Plaintiff filed the Declaration of Jarrod Y. Nakano ("Nakano Declaration," Dkt. No. 26-1) along with Exhibit A (partial transcript of Defendant's deposition testimony) ("Nakano Exhibit A"), and the Declaration of David Lopez ("Lopez Declaration," Dkt. No. 26-2). Defendant Coombe-Hesperia replied on October 5, 2020. ("Reply," Dkt. No. 27.)

II. FACTUAL ALLEGATONS
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff is substantially limited in walking, standing, ambulating, and sitting, and relies upon mobility devices to ambulate. (Compl. ¶ 1.) Plaintiff has a Disabled Person Parking Placard issued to him by the State of California. (Id.) On December 30, 2019, Plaintiff went to Desert Valley Medical Group ("DVMG"), operated by Defendant Coombe-Hesperia Road, LLC, to inquire about medical services. (Id. ¶¶ 3, 9.) Although the facility had parking spaces, there [*3]  were no designated parking spaces available for persons with disabilities that complied with the Americans with Disability Act Accessibility Guidelines ("ADAAG"). (Id. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff had extreme difficulty availing himself to DVMG. (Id. ¶ 11.) Defendant has a built-up curb ramp that projects from the sidewalk and into the disabled parking area, in excess of the maximum grade allowed by ADAAG specifications. (Id. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff believes that Defendant had no policy or plan to make sure that there was a compliant accessible parking space reserved for persons with disabilities prior to his visit. (Id. ¶ 14.) The designated parking spaces for persons with disabilities are a tip over, crash, fall, or trip hazard because they contain a built-up curb ramp and cross slopes. (Id. ¶ 16.) Plaintiff encountered these barriers, which denied him full access to DVMG and caused him difficulty, humiliation, and frustration. (Id. ¶ 17.) Plaintiff intends to return to DVMG to avail himself of the goods and services offered and to ensure that they comply with federal and state law. (Id. ¶ 19.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD

A. Rule 12(b)(1)
Defendant moves to dismiss the FAC pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(h)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A Rule 12(b)(1) motion challenges the court's [*4]  subject matter jurisdiction, without which, a federal district court cannot adjudicate the case before it. See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 114 S. Ct. 1673, 128 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1994). Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), a party may seek dismissal of an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction "either on the face of the pleadings or by presenting extrinsic evidence." Sierra v. Dep't. of Family and Children Servs., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91068, 2016 WL 3751954, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 26, 2016) (quoting Warren v. Fox Family Worldwide, Inc., 328 F.3d 1136, 1139 (9th Cir. 2003)). Thus, a jurisdictional challenge can be either facial or factual. White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1242 (9th Cir. 2000).
In a facial attack, the moving party asserts that the allegations contained in the complaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction. Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004). When evaluating a facial attack, the court must accept the factual allegations in the plaintiff's complaint as true. Comm. for Immigrant Rights of Sonoma Cty. v. Cty. of Sonoma, 644 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1189 (N.D. Cal. 2009). "By contrast, in a factual attack, the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that, by themselves, would otherwise invoke federal jurisdiction." Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at 1039. In resolving a factual challenge, the court "need not presume the truthfulness of the plaintiff's allegations" and "may look beyond the complaint to matters of public record without having to convert the motion into one for summary judgment." White, 227 F.3d at 1242. "Where jurisdiction is intertwined with the merits, [the Court] must 'assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint . . . unless controverted by undisputed [*5]  facts in the record.'" Warren, 328 F.3d at 1139 (quoting Roberts v. Corrothers, 812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 1987)).
Furthermore, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(3) provides that, "[i]f the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action." Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3).

B. ADA Standing
"[T]o invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts, a disabled individual claiming discrimination must satisfy the case or controversy requirement[s] of Article III by demonstrating his standing to sue at each stage of the litigation." Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 946 (9th Cir. 2011). To establish standing, Plaintiff must "demonstrate that he has suffered an injury-in-fact, that the injury is traceable to the [Defendant's] actions, and that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision." Id. Only the first element, injury-in-fact, is at issue here.
"Damages are not recoverable under Title III of the ADA—only injunctive relief is available for violations of Title III." Wander v. Kaus, 304 F.3d 856, 858 (9th Cir. 2002). "[A] plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must additionally demonstrate 'a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way.'" Chapman, 631 F.3d at 948 (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983)). "That is, he must establish a 'real and immediate threat of repeated injury.'" Id. (quoting Lyons, 461 U.S. at 102). Thus, Plaintiff may establish standing under the ADA in one of two ways: (1) demonstrating an intent [*6]  to return to the allegedly noncompliant accommodation; or (2) demonstrating that he is deterred from visiting the noncompliant public accommodation because he has encountered barriers related to his disability there. Chapman, 631 F.3d at 949.

IV. DISCUSSION
Defendant moves to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Mot.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff does not have standing to sue, given that he admitted in his deposition that he had no plan to return to DVMG, failing to establish the requisite intent to return. (Mot. at 1, 6.) The Court agrees.

A. Standard
Plaintiff's Opposition states the wrong standard for Defendant's 12(b)(1) motion.1 Plaintiff states that "the court must accept as true the allegations of the complaint and construe the complaint in light most favorable to the pleader." (Opp'n at 7 (citing Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 322, 92 S. Ct. 1079, 31 L. Ed. 2d 263 (1972) and Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 421, 89 S. Ct. 1843, 23 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1969)).) But this is not a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge, and the standard is different for a Rule 12(b)(1) factual challenge. Defendant's Motion presents a factual challenge, disputing the truth of Plaintiff's allegations in the Complaint through extrinsic evidence. Safe for Everyone, 373 F.3d at 1039. As established above, unlike with facial attacks or Rule 12(b)(6) motions, in resolving a factual challenge, courts "need not presume the truthfulness of the plaintiff's [*7]  allegations" and "may look beyond the complaint." White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1242 (9th Cir. 2000). The Court applies the correct standard.

B. Intent to Return
Defendant argues that Plaintiff lacks standing because he fails to demonstrate an intent to visit DVMG and encounter the alleged ADA violations again. Isolated, past incidents of ADA violations do not support an inference that a plaintiff faces a real and immediate threat of continued, future violations of the ADA in the absence of injunctive relief. See Midgett v. Tri—Cty. Met. Trans. Dist. of Or., 254 F.3d 846, 850 (9th Cir.2001). To determine whether a plaintiff's likelihood of returning to a place of public accommodation is sufficient to confer standing, courts examine factors such as "(1) the proximity of defendant's business to plaintiff's residence, (2) plaintiff's past patronage of defendant's business, (3) the definitiveness of plaintiff's plans to return, and (4) the plaintiff's frequency of travel near defendant." Johnson v. DTBA, LLC, 424 F. Supp. 3d 657, 663 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (quoting Johnson v. Overlook at Blue Ravine, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102056, 2012 WL 2993890, at *3 (E.D. Cal. 2012) (collecting cases)). But these are not definitive, and "the key inquiry remains whether Plaintiff had a likelihood of returning to the [] premises." D'Lil v. Stardust Vacation Club, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23309, 2001 WL 1825832, at *3 (E.D. Cal. 2001). To satisfy this standard, Plaintiff "must demonstrate [his] intent to return" to the area and go to DVMG. Brooke v. Kashl Corp., 362 F. Supp. 3d 864, 874 (S.D. Cal. 2019).
As Defendant points out, Plaintiff testified in [*8]  a deposition that he did not plan to return to Desert Valley Medical Group. (Mot. at 6; Link Ex. A, at 41; Reply at 3.) Plaintiff makes no effort to challenge or dispute this testimony. Plaintiff's declaration (which mostly parrots the allegations in the Complaint) contains only conclusory statements about Plaintiff's plans to return to DVMG. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 13.) Lopez states that he "intend[s] to return to the Business for the dual purpose of availing myself of the goods and services offered to the public and to ensure that the Business ceases evading its responsibilities under federal and state law." (Id.) But "'some day' intentions—without any description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day will be—do not support a finding of 'actual or imminent injury.'" Norkunas v. Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77355, 2007 WL 2949569, at *3 (D. Nev. Oct. 10, 2007) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992)) (emphasis in original). Merely stating an intent to return is not adequate response to Defendant's 12(b)(1) factual attack on standing. Id.; Luu v. Ramparts, Inc., 926 F. Supp. 2d 1178, 1182 (D. Nev. 2013) ("[Plaintiff's affidavit contains classic 'some day,' non-concrete plans to stay at the Luxor, and these statements accordingly cannot survive Defendant's Motion."). And "failure to respond to Defendant['s] substantive attacks constitutes a concession [*9]  to their truth." Id.
Other factors also counsel against standing. Defendant notes that Plaintiff drove 49 miles from his home in Ontario to Victorville. (Mot. at 6; Link Ex. A and B; Reply at 4.) Plaintiff testified that he went to Victorville "multiple times" to breed his dog, but does not testify that he intends to do so in the future. (Nakano Ex. A at 19:12-21.) Plaintiff testified that he only went to DVMG once. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 5.) Thus, considering Plaintiff's lack of concrete plans to return to Victorville or DVMG, his geographic distance from DVMG, and his infrequent visits, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not sufficiently established an intent to return. Johnson, 424 F. Supp. 3d at 663.

C. Deterrence from Visiting
Plaintiff's deterrence argument fares no better. "A disabled individual also suffers a cognizable injury if he is deterred from visiting a noncompliant public accommodation because he has encountered barriers related to his disability there." Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 949 (9th Cir. 2011). In his declaration, Lopez states that he has "not visited the Business out of fear of the faulty ramp and the accessibility issues that [he] would face by patronizing the Business again," and asserts that he is "being deterred from patronizing [*10]  the Business and its accommodations on particular occasions." (Lopez Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.) "Still, under this test, an ADA plaintiff must show an intent to return." Johnson v. Mantena LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56457, 2020 WL 1531355, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2020). Plaintiff fails to establish why he would prefer this medical office over others, any specific instances of deterrence, or any concrete plan to patronize the medical office in the future. "His allegations of deterrence are thus strictly theoretical; he has not demonstrated a sufficient likelihood that he will be wronged in a similar way." 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56457, [WL] at *5.
Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot show meet the "imminence" requirement of standing and this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over his ADA claims.

D. Other Arguments
Because the Court finds that Plaintiff failed to establish an intent to return or deterrence from returning, the Court does not reach Defendant's alternative arguments.

E. State Law Claims
Defendant asks the Court to dismiss Plaintiff's state law cause of action, arguing that since the federal ADA claims should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1), "supplemental jurisdiction can never exist." (Mot. at 10 (quoting Herman Family Revocable Tr. V. Teddy Bear, 254 F.3d 802, 806 (9th Cir. 2001)).) Plaintiff presents no argument as to why this Court should retain jurisdiction over the state law claims should the federal claims [*11]  be dismissed. The Court accordingly DISMISSES Plaintiff's state law claims without prejudice to their filing in state court. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons above, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion. The Clerk is directed to close this case. The November 2, 2020 hearing is VACATED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
