Opinion



ORDER
Pro se litigant Jennifer J. Reinoehl appeals the district court's judgment dismissing her complaint claiming discrimination based on Michigan's mask mandate. This case has been referred to a panel of the court that, upon examination, unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a). Because Reinoehl failed to state viable claims, we affirm the dismissal.
In 2021, Reinoehl sued Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Robert Gordon, and the Young Men's Christian Association of Greater Michiana, Inc. (YMCA). Although much of her complaint concerns her general thesis that cloth facemasks [*2]  are an ineffective means to control the spread of COVID-19, her claim for discrimination centers around a single incident on January 4, 2021. Reinoehl, who has asthma and tachycardia, alleged that the YMCA denied her entry to its Niles branch to watch her daughter swim because she did not wear a facemask. She claimed that YMCA staff refused to accept her word that she suffered from breathing problems despite showing them her inhaler and that they said they would rather follow Michigan's facemask guidance than the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Reinoehl therefore claimed that she was discriminated against based on her disability under Title III of the ADA; that her First Amendment rights to free speech and to the free exercise of religion were violated because facemasks make her words difficult to understand and force her to participate in a pagan cult; that her right against unlawful searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment was violated; and that her Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to substantive and procedural due process and to equal protection were violated by Michigan's mask mandate. She sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. The district court denied Reinoehl's motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
The defendants moved to [*3]  dismiss the complaint, and a magistrate judge recommended granting the motion. Reinoehl v. Whitmer, No. 1:21-cv-61, 2022 WL 1110273 (W.D. Mich. Feb. 3, 2022). Reinoehl then moved for leave to file a second amended complaint. Over Reinoehl's objections, the district court adopted the report and recommendation, denied leave to file a second amended complaint--because the motion was untimely and amendment would be futile—and dismissed the case. Reinoehl v. Whitmer, No. 1:21-cv-61, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52326, 2022 WL 855266 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 23, 2022).
On appeal, Reinoehl argues that she should have been allowed to pursue a claim under Title II of the ADA even though she explicitly invoked Title III; that Whitmer and Gordon should not be protected by qualified immunity in their individual capacities; that her claims that facemasks violate her religious beliefs and stifle her speech are not frivolous; that the YMCA's refusal to grant her entry to their property is a seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment; that her procedural due process rights are triggered because of the risk to her life posed by requiring her to wear a facemask; that requiring people to wear ineffective facemasks is tyrannical; that she should have been allowed to file the second amended complaint because its lateness was due to a mailing error and the proposed pleading stated her claims better than the first [*4]  amended complaint; and that she should have been allowed to file a doctor's note under seal.
We review de novo a district court's judgment granting a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). See Bickerstaff v. Lucarelli, 830 F.3d 388, 395-96 (6th Cir. 2016). To avoid dismissal, "a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)).
Whitmer and Gordon assert that Reinoehl lacks standing to sue them because she did not allege facts connecting their actions to the YMCA's decision to exclude her from their facility for not wearing a facemask. "Article III of the Constitution gives federal courts subject matter jurisdiction over actual cases or controversies, neither of which exists unless a plaintiff establishes [her] standing to sue." Murray v. U.S. Dep't of Treasury, 681 F.3d 744, 748 (6th Cir. 2012). To establish standing, "[t]he plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision." Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 194 L. Ed. 2d 635 (2016). Although the YMCA, rather than Whitmer or Gordon, made the decision not to admit Reinoehl, she alleged that the YMCA told her that they were doing so in order to follow the state mask regulations. The YMCA itself claimed in its motion to dismiss [*5]  that "Plaintiff was ultimately prevented entry to the YMCA based on Michigan directives then in place." Given these allegations, Reinoehl's claimed injury could be traced back to the state regulations to at least some degree, and we conclude that the district court correctly exercised jurisdiction.
Turning to Reinoehl's ADA claim against Whitmer and Gordon, Title III prohibits discrimination on the basis of a disability by a person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Because Whitmer and Gordon do not personally own, lease, or operate the YMCA or a place of public accommodation, the ADA claim against them was correctly dismissed. See Madej v. Maiden, 951 F.3d 364, 372 (6th Cir. 2020) (noting that Title III covers private entities). In her proposed second amended complaint, Reinoehl attempted to raise this claim under Title II, which provides that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. If Reinoehl meant to raise that claim instead of her Title III claim, it would still fail because she [*6]  sued Whitmer and Gordon solely in their individual capacities, and Title II claims cannot be brought against public officials acting in their individual capacities. See Everson v. Leis, 556 F.3d 484, 501 n.7 (6th Cir. 2009). Reinoehl waited until her reply brief to raise related claims under Michigan law, and we therefore need not consider them here. See Sanborn v. Parker, 629 F.3d 554, 579 (6th Cir. 2010); Osborne v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins, 465 F.3d 296, 301 (6th Cir. 2006).
Reinoehl's allegations against the YMCA might support a viable ADA Title III claim. See Camarillo v. Carrols Corp., 518 F.3d 153, 156 (2d Cir. 2008) (outlining the elements). But Title III does not provide for money damages to an aggrieved person except in a discrimination action brought by the Attorney General. See Southwell v. Summit View of Farragut, LLC, 494 F. App'x 508, 512 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Smith v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 167 F.3d 286, 293 & n.5 (6th Cir. 1999)). Because Michigan's mask mandate has since been rescinded and Reinoehl does not allege an independent policy of the YMCA to exclude her, her Title III claim against the YMCA is moot. See Resurrection School v. Hertel, 35 F.4th 524, 527 (6th Cir. 2022) (en banc).
Reinoehl next claimed that her First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and the free exercise of her religion were violated by Michigan's masking rules. She based her free speech claim on her belief that a facemask muffles her voice and makes her difficult to understand. She based her freedom-of-religion claim on the fact that masks in some form "have been used since ancient times in pagan religious ceremonies" and that forcing her to [*7]  participate in wearing a mask thus violates her faith. These theories stretch plausibility beyond the point of breaking. She also suggested that some people might refuse to wear a mask as a form of protest in and of itself, but she does not claim that was her purpose or allege facts suggesting that she was discriminated against on that basis.
Reinoehl also asserted that the defendants violated her Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. But she did not allege any facts suggesting that she was searched, whether by a state official or a YMCA employee, or that any defendant used force with the intent to restrain her. See Torres v. Madrid, 141 S. Ct. 989, 998, 209 L. Ed. 2d 190 (2021). Neither do her allegations suggest that a reasonable person in her position would have believed she was not free to leave after being denied entry to the YMCA. See United States v. Gross, 662 F.3d 393, 398-99 (6th Cir. 2011). This claim was correctly dismissed.
Reinoehl next raised both procedural and substantive due process claims. There are "two steps for analyzing procedural due process claims: (1) 'whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the State' and (2) 'whether the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient.'" Bethel v. Jenkins, 988 F.3d 931, 942 (6th Cir. 2021) (quoting Ky. Dep't of Corr. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460, 109 S. Ct. 1904, 104 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1989)). She does [*8]  not identify any caselaw establishing that she had a right to enter a privately owned and run recreational facility, however. And individualized process is not required when the state issues a generally applicable law or order. See Neinast v. Bd. of Trs. of Columbus Metro. Library, 346 F.3d 585, 596-97 (6th Cir. 2003).
Substantive due process protects only "those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed." Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720-21, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 117 S. Ct. 2302, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997) (cleaned up). To establish a substantive due process claim, a plaintiff generally must show the deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest without any reasonable justification in a legitimate governmental objective, see Parrino v. Price, 869 F.3d 392, 397 (6th Cir. 2017), or establish that the government engaged in conduct that shocks the conscience, see Pittman v. Cuyahoga Cnty. Dep't of Child & Fam. Servs., 640 F.3d 716, 728 (6th Cir. 2011). Reinoehl cites no authority that she has a fundamental right to enter a privately owned recreational facility, and thus the public health regulation is subject to rational basis review, "requiring only that the regulation bear some rational relation to a legitimate state interest." Craigmiles v. Giles, 312 F.3d 220, 223 (6th Cir. 2002); see Liberty Coins, LLC v. Goodman, 748 F.3d 682, 692-93 (6th Cir. 2014).
Whitmer and Gordon had a legitimate interest in controlling [*9]  the spread of COVID-19 in Michigan, and their mask mandate is rationally related to that interest. Reinoehl claims that cloth masks are not an effective means to curtail the spread of COVID-19, but under rational basis review a regulation "may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data." FCC v. Beach Commc'ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 314-15 (1993).
Reinoehl also raised an equal protection claim asserting that the mask mandate prevented her from enjoying the same access to public spaces as non-disabled persons. Medically disabled persons are not a suspect class for purposes of an equal protection challenge, however. See S.S. v. E. Ky. Univ., 532 F.3d 445, 457 (6th Cir. 2008). Because she does not allege that she was treated differently than other similarly situated individuals, and given that the masking regulation passes the rational basis test, this claim was also properly dismissed.
Insofar as Reinoehl still requests injunctive relief concerning the mask mandates, they have been rescinded and the claims are thus moot. See Resurrection School, 35 F.4th at 527. And whether she should have been allowed to seal her doctor's note from public view is irrelevant to the dismissal of her claims.
Reinoehl also challenges the denial of her motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. A district court should [*10]  "freely" grant a party leave to amend her complaint "when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). But a court may deny leave "if there is 'undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.'" Riverview Health Inst. V. Med. Mut. Of Ohio, 601 F.3d 505, 520 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962)).
We ordinarily review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion, see Williams v. City of Cleveland, 771 F.3d 945, 949 (6th Cir. 2014), but when the district court has denied leave based on its legal conclusion that amendment would be futile, we review whether the proposed amended complaint "contains 'sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Id. (quoting D'Ambrosio v. Marino, 747 F.3d 378, 383 (6th Cir. 2014)).
The district court correctly determined that amendment would be futile because the proposed second amended complaint largely raised the same claims. Reinoehl's minor alterations—such as adding a claim under Title II of the ADA or referencing 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)—do not save the complaint or raise new, viable claims for relief. Moreover, the district court determined that the eleventh-hour timing of Reinoehl's motion demonstrated undue delay because she waited until [*11]  long after the defendants had filed their motions to dismiss, as well as after the report and recommendation and objections to it had been filed. These claims were available to her from the time she filed her lawsuit, and mailing issues and a snowstorm do not explain this extended delay. The district court's denial of leave on this basis was not an abuse of discretion.
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's judgment.
